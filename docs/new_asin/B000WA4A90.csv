When I watched them, I became hooked on Takeshi Kitano and personally reckon that his gangster movies rate as some of the best and most exciting gangster movies ever made. They are violent, they are often very bleak, but they are not without a subtle humour and even warmth too.

There is an atmosphere in Japanase movies, and especially Takeshi Kitano movies that is hard to put your finger on. Perhaps as a European I am drawn to his movies, and other Japanese movies too because they do have a different feel and sensibility to European and American movies; I am really not sure. Anyway, I rate Takeshi Kitano and his movies because they always have a twist in them, or something extra, or a sly sense of humour, or something which sets them apart from most other film-makers movies. Takeshi himself is very charismatic, even though he isn't particularly tall or even particularly handsome, and he is a good actor and great film-maker.

All three films are in their own way brilliant and exciting, and probably if I am pushed I really like 'Sonatine' the most, but 'Boiling Point' and 'Violent cop' are also very good movies too. I suppose I like 'Sonatine' the best because it has, as well as being very violent, a great vein of wit, humour and warmth all through the film and a great music score too. There are scenes in it which will make you wince, and scenes in it which will make you laugh too.

All in all, if you like really good gangster movies, Japanese culture (or a certain section of Japanese culture), and you have never experienced Takeshi Kitano movies or Takeshi Kitano, I highly recommend that you buy the Beat Takeshi Trilogy dvd's. You'll be in for a treat!
