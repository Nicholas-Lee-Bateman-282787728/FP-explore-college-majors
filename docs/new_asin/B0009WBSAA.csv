However, I've seen the actresses and NO WAY can Nia Vardalos compare to the gorgeous Elvira Bolgova -- who'll remind you of every pretty blonde you've ever seen. And she's not a bad actress either.

This turned out to be a Russian mini-series rather than a film. 4 episodes, each about 50 minutes long. Flimsy storytelling but I sat thru the entire thing without pain.

It's the type of story where a Russian girl and an Armenian man fall in love at first sight but don't have time to exchange any information -- and almost immediately, at a grocery store, she finds a magazine with him on the cover (It must have been ""The Plastic Surgeons Quarterly"").

I found the first half more interesting than the wedding-focused latter half. The film manages to convey the contrasting flavors of Russia and Armenia very well. But most of all, it has Elvira.",1299542400,,970,4.595375722543353
8068225,5,B0009WBSAA,"I absolutely love, love, love this film! It's a comedy made in the best traditions of Russian cinema: good music, funny but kind jokes, beautiful talented actors. It's a fairly new film from 2005. An Armenian guy Tigran falls in love with a Russian girl Lena, but their families are against the interracial relationship. The couple have to overcome obstacles to keep their love and happiness! It's a bit like an Indian movie: a bit naive, but very sweet! An excellent light romantic comedy! At the same time this movie does have a serious side to it as well: in a gentle way it raises the numerous issues of interracial relationships in Russia today. The hurdles, misconceptions, and stereotypes that accompany the meeting of two different cultures.

P.S. Luckily, this movie is available on DVD with English subtitles!",1273017600,2,819,4.934782608695652
