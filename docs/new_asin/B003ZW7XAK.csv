Operatic like The Godfather, but with more authentic sleaze and considerably lower budgets and production values.  The series went on an on and I hope to follow it to the end via DVD set releases.  Recommended!",1494374400,,360,4.774193548387097

8411108,5,B003ZW7XAK,"The portrayal of the characters , the story line, the location
are exciting and addicting.  My husband and I savor the
nights we watch this.  The Mafia has such a hold on the
city by cherry picking their next victim and sucking the life
out of each one like a spider or in this case an octopus.
Those who choose to fight back are few so the inspector
is a precious commodity for a community who is too
frightened to do anything for the most part.  His character
uses his wiles to good use and the Mafia is sometimes one
step ahead and sometimes not.  He has battles at home
as well with a wife who is .......well, let's just say she is a piece
of work.  His daughter is played very well and reminds
the parents of their responsibilities .  The villains  are portrayed scurrilously
and odiously by the actors chosen and against the well intentioned inspector they
are fitting.",1375142400,,875,4.39751552795031

Yes, the music may be a bit lame occasionally and the speech fast enough to have to stop and play back the subtitles, but, it is outstanding!",1365811200,,245,4.6976744186046515

8411111,4,B003ZW7XAK,"Spoiler warning! This review of Octopus Season 3 reveals plot details from Octopus Season 2.

Moving into its third season, The Octopus remains compelling drama, with great performances and plenty of intrigues to keep fans entertained.  However, its essential plot remains much the same as the first two series, along the following lines - Corrado Cattani and his allies learn of a devious new Mafia money-laundering deal, the Mafia fight back ruthlessly once its illicit gains from the deal are threatened (revealing in the process how far its tentacles reach into Italy's political and financial elite), Cattani and the law enforcement authorities ultimately prevail, but at a terrible cost in lives.  Accordingly, some of the originality of the first two seasons has been lost.  Also, this season is particularly bloody and, as the body count stacks up over the seven episodes of the season (one more episode than the previous two seasons), the viewer may feel something he didn't in the earlier seasons - a lack of plot credibility.

In Season 3, the action moves away from Sicily and Rome (where the first two seasons were mostly set) to Milan. While the Sicilian mafia (particularly Corrado's old enemy Terrasini) continue to play a part in Season 3, many new characters are introduced and the focus shifts to Milan's Antinari Bank and more generally its links to the Mafia.  Over the season we get to know the head of the bank, Carlo Antinari, his wife Anna, their elder daughter Giulia (Corrado's love interest in Season 3), their younger daughter Greta and Dino Alessi, the sinister director-general of the bank.

Season 3 begins with a flashback to the court trial of key Mafia figures from the end of Season 2.  They're being tried for the killings of Inspector Altero, Judge Bordonaro, Colonel Feretti, Else Cattani (who saved Corrado's life by taking the gunshots intended for Corrado) and the abduction and rape of Paola Cattani.  It's been the trial of the year, and now the court has reached its verdict.  But the defendants get away with their crimes surprisingly lightly. Terrasini is sentenced to three years' prison for Mafia-style association (and he's already served most of it, so will be released soon).  Gianfranco Laudeo, now 54 years old, is found guilty of money-laundering crimes only and is acquitted from the more serious charge of complicity to murder.  He's been sentenced to five years' prison, and is serving his time in a prison near Milan.  Countess Olga Camastra is acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Corrado is angered and depressed at the results of the trial.  He feels justice hasn't been served, and is unable to come to terms with the evil in the world.  A complete emotional mess, he seeks refuge in a monastery, where the Abbot Lovani advises him to adopt a more spiritual approach to life.

While at the monastery, Corrado is visited by an FBI agent, Bert Di Donato, who is investigating internationally wanted criminal Kemal Yfter, a 40 year old Turkish man living in Luxembourg.  Yfter is involved in illegal arms trafficking to the Middle East. Laudeo, Corrado's most powerful and cunning enemy, is Yfter's associate in Italy. Di Donato wants Corrado's help with the investigation, knowing that Corrado might like the chance of revenge on Laudeo.  Also, Di Donato wants to make Laudeo to reveal his links with Yfter, and believes Corrado is the only one who can do this.

With some reluctance, Corrado agrees to help Di Donato.  Corrado confronts Laudeo in prison, laying out his illegal activities.  These are formidable. Laudeo helped Yfter sell billions of dollars worth of goods - missiles and automatic weapons to Iraq and Iran; 32 billion lire worth of cocaine imported from Columbia; and helped an Eastern block country sell 5,000 Kalanikov assault rifles and five tonnes of explosives to an Arab country.  Yfter earned $5 million dollars out of all this, with a nice slice to Laudeo.  Corrado tells Laudeo he has the choice of either co-operating with the Yfter investigation or face 20 years more jail.

Laudeo thinks Corrado has been ""sent"" by Carlo Antinari, who is financing one of Laudeo's arms deals.  Laudeo thinks Antinari wants the deal to fall through and is using Corrado as a tool to achieve this.

What dreadful retaliation has Laudeo planned for Antinari? Within the first half-hour of Season 3, viewers will learn what it is, and this launches the storyline of Season 3.",1318032000,2,4444,4.954177897574124

Here is the summary of Series 3, as given on the box:

""In Series 3, Police Inspector Corrado Cattani returns to investigate the shady dealings of Carlo Antinari, head of a powerful banking family.  Cattani finds himself falling in love with Antinari's daughter, Giulia.  Meanwhile, Mafia lawyer Terrasini is released from prison - bent on revenge against his old nemesis.  Can Cattani bring the Sicilian Mob to justice once and for all?""

(Note: if he did, there would be no Series 4, 5. etc.).",1314230400,3,737,4.703125
