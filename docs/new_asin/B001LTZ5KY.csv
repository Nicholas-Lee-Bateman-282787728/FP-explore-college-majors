3691507,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This video really came in handy for our first dance as husband and wife.  We got the video in March, starting practicing at least 1/2x week in April and May for our wedding on Memorial Weekend.  It was a hit!  The DVD is pretty easy to follow.  Thanks so much for a great product that's fitting even for beginner dancers!",1276041600,,321,4.3
3691508,5,B001LTZ5KY,"My now-husband and I received the DVD very quickly (within a couple days of ordering) and began practicing immediately. Our wedding was almost exactly 2 weeks from the date I originally ordered the disc.

With this DVD's guidance, we prepared and a dance to ""To Die For"", a beautiful song by The Birthday Massacre.  Our dance was made up entirely from steps taught on the DVD.  The steps fit perfectly and we rehearsed every day until our wedding.

My only regret is not getting video of the first dance - we completely stunned our guests.  We didn't tell anyone what we had planned, not even my mom who surprised us with a ton of balloons as a ""distraction"".  She thought we'd be nervous and shy about dancing! Instead, everyone is still talking about our first dance 2 weeks later.  It is literally the one thing EVERYONE remembers about the reception.

Even better, the steps learned from the DVD carried on through the rest of night's dancing, too. We looked great dancing to everything! My parents were floored by how well my husband and I were dancing.
Honestly, I was too!  I've never had such a great time dancing before in my life. Your Wedding Dance DVD is a miracle worker!! I can't thank them enough.",1259625600,18,1212,4.6
3691509,5,B001LTZ5KY,"Before you spend a dime on dance lessons for the biggest event of your life, buy this DVD. It is well organized, easy to follow and FUN. Don't get caught on your wedding day (or any other day) doing the Hug and Wobble ever again. Thank you for your expertise and guidance.",1255737600,3,272,4.25
3691510,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This instructional dvd is not only enjoyable to watch, but is also user friendly.  With histories of the dances, and walk through demonstrations, the steps are easy to pick up.  With a little practice it saved my partner's toes, and turned our first dance into something more memorable.",1255564800,,286,4.9375
3691511,5,B001LTZ5KY,"""Amazingly clear and easy to navigate, this is by far the best dance DVD we've ever used. We picked up the steps right away and then started improvising.  Fun and entertaining, it's a must-get for anyone interested in dances for weddings.""

3691512,5,B001LTZ5KY,"The Wedding Dance DVD is geared at the perfect level for the couple who wants to take that step beyond ""Hug and Wobble"" without enormous effort or expense. It is clear, well-organized, and easy-to-follow.  With the help of this video, anyone can do it--you won't be scared any longer and your wedding dance will be enjoyed by all (even you)!",1254268800,,341,4.683333333333334
3691513,5,B001LTZ5KY,I found this DVD very easy and fun to learn - even for someone like myself who has always felt that they could never dance.  It is clearly presented and the dance is charming and romantic.  I can recommend it with great enthusiasm.,1252540800,,231,4.348837209302325
3691514,5,B001LTZ5KY,"Kurt has created an easy to follow dance video that introduces all the basics and then helps the beginner to improvise, putting together different steps to make their own style.  It is also good as a review of the basics even for those who have taken dance classes before, but want to brush up for a special event, such as YOUR WEDDING DANCE!",1252454400,4,342,4.428571428571429
3691515,1,B001LTZ5KY,I'm not sure why there are so many people giving this DVD good reviews and that's why I bought it. But this wedding instruction is absolutely bad! You couldn't learn much at all. It's absolutely boring. You could only see two people holding hands walking back and forth.,1344038400,3,270,4.645833333333333
3691516,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This video is worth buying! We were getting married and neither one of us really knew what we were going to do on the dance floor. Yes, it can be cheesy at times but it helps you remember the steps. The instructors explain well, and are to the point. They give you a basic yet elegant dance routine that you can expand on or keep. We learned our dance routine and felt confident on our big day! Wish they had more videos like this one that teaches other dances!",1325030400,2,461,4.191011235955056
3691517,1,B001LTZ5KY,"Are you completely uncoordinated? Have you only recently learned the word ""dance""? Then this DVD is for you. The demo dance is the corniest, simplest dance that most people could copy after watching it a few times. It is not necessary to have a whole DVD to explain it. I've never done any sort of partnering dance, only ballet a long time ago, and I could have danced better than these people. Use Youtube instead, or buy any other social dance DVD, don't waste your money. Learning through this will NOT impress people at your wedding.",1323907200,3,537,4.604166666666667
3691518,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This is a terrific DVD for non-dancers who want to look good for their wedding first dance, but don't have enough time to take dance classes.  My new husband really could not dance at all, and I had never done any partner dancing.  We could not fit actual dance classes into our schedules.  We only spent a few hours going through this DVD, and we were able to put together a nice first dance for our wedding.  We won't be winning any dance contests anytime soon, but our guests were impressed with our dance and even applauded a couple times!  After watching this DVD, my husband was even able to teach his mother and brother some of the steps and got them to dance at our wedding reception!  I highly recommend this DVD!",1317600000,3,722,4.390977443609023
3691519,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This is a terrific video for those who feel they cannot dance.  My husband has been told to stay away from the dance floor all his life, but thanks to this video both of us can really get up and dance. The video begins with how to stand and hold each other and how to relax.  It's that basic. The next lesson is a step by step demonstration of some basic steps. Then the couple show how to add to those steps with some turns and what to do with a faster beat. The whole learning process is clearly presented.  We learned by using the pause button and slow motion for just a few minutes each night.  The video gives music suggestions and a little history for extra tidbits of information.  This video is advertised for a wedding dance but it is perfect for beginners.  If you think you cannot dance give this video a try.",1310688000,7,820,4.2243589743589745
3691520,3,B001LTZ5KY,"This has got to be the most HOKEY DVD I've ever seen! It is soooo poorly put together it's ridiculous. I could have filmed this and edited this in my basement. The guy in the video is soooo corny and totally creepy and the woman looks like shes on her deathbed in the sequences that she has the gown on. The menus have NO continuity, and they speed through the hard parts and take forever on the easy parts. The most valuable part of the DVD is just watching the sequences and doing what they do. Did I learn to dance for my wedding...yes...but the above reviews must be paid by the makers of this DVD because there is NO WAY anyone would rate this DVD 4 or 5 stars.",1308873600,3,666,4.130769230769231
3691521,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This DVD is easy to use.  My fiance are working on it for our wedding dance.  It gives great tips, and it's pretty easy to follow.",1301616000,,130,3.9615384615384617
3691522,5,B001LTZ5KY,"My fiance and I bought this DVD so we could learn to dance for our wedding, and it was so worth it. It was easy to follow, and with practice, we were actually able to feel good about our dancing. If you want to learn how to dance while looking graceful and cool, this is just the best dvd out there (and we bought several). Don't think you can watch it once, and be a pro though. We had to practice, and work at it, and soon we were amazed at how much fun we were having. The instructor makes it easy, and fun. This is so inexpensive compared to lessons, and you get to learn in your own time at home. We amazed everyone at the wedding, and got a standing ovation. We've discovered how much fun ballroom dancing is, and continue to work at becoming better. Love the DVD!",1295740800,,770,4.105960264900662
3691523,5,B001LTZ5KY,This video helps takes all the fear out of couples dancing! The presentation is well organized. All steps are demonstrated and described simply. Cute sense of humor! Bought it to help my son (an engineer type) get ready for his own wedding dance... he liked it and after watching parts and practicing with me he took it home for further study. Thanks for creating it!,1288656000,,367,4.661538461538462
3691524,5,B001LTZ5KY,This DVD is an excellent start to dancing! I  love the way it is broken down into easy to learn sequences with descriptions from the man's point of view and the woman's point of view. This DVD also addresses what to do with your arms and general helpful hints on how to make it all look good.,1287360000,,292,4.12280701754386
3691544,5,B001LTZ5KY,"If you are not lucky enough to take a class with Kurt, this DVD is the next best thing! Kurt and Christel make learning fun and the DVD is very user-friendly.

3691546,5,B001LTZ5KY,We found this DVD a fun easy way of learning enough to enjoy dancing at our daughter's wedding.  The instructors take everything step by step and obviously enjoy teaching.,1286582400,,171,4.896551724137931
3691547,5,B001LTZ5KY,"I thought that ever getting my husband and I to look remotely comfortable on the dance floor was never going to happen.  This DVD makes everything easy to understand. You could watch the moves over and over as many times as you need until you actually ""get it"".  Highly recommended!",1286496000,,282,4.62
3691548,5,B001LTZ5KY,"Kurt and Christel have identified the elements of slow dancing so that they are easy to see, understand, and perform.  The DVD is very confidence-building and fun to watch.  Slow dancing doesn't need to be boring!",1286496000,,213,4.888888888888889
3691549,5,B001LTZ5KY,"I'm a midle aged guy and got this DVD knowing nothing - absolutely nada - about ballroom dancing. Instruction is clear and concise and entertaining and while I don't think I'll be winning prizes any time soon, at least I no longer have a fear of the dance floor.",1286323200,4,262,4.36734693877551
3691550,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This DVD is excellent! My husband and I do not dance. He is 6'4 and I have no rythm.  This video made us laugh, have fun and got us dancing.  We are so much more comfortable now getting up to dance at a recednt wedding and have found ourselves grooving in our local pub.  It really is a fun way for us to reconnect after having a our son 17 months ago.  Now the whole family is watching us dance and have a blast.  I wish we had this for our wedding.. We hugged and wobbled!  ( not complaining)
The teachers are a hoot and really seem to enjoy getting the dance message out!

3691551,5,B001LTZ5KY,"This dvd will take you from the aptly described ""hug and wobble"" rut to a simple grace on the dance floor.  Kurt and Christel's straight-forward, but, laid-back instruction style give you the confidence to take the leap into actual dance moves.  They even offer encouragement for those who have trouble finding the beat.  Remarkable.",1286150400,,333,5.12962962962963
3691552,5,B001LTZ5KY,"Review of ""Your Wedding Dance""

 This instructional DVD is ideal for older couples who are trying to keep active by dancing from time to time.  Kurt Lichtmann has streamlined the Fox Trot and it is easy to remember and to perform.  If you are one of those who believes that dancing requires learning a lot of steps, you will be pleasantly surprised to see how good a couple can look and feel with a few patterns.  And, of course, it is great for the members of the wedding.",1286150400,,473,4.329545454545454
3691553,3,B001LTZ5KY,"This video is VERY low budget, I did not think it was worth the price. I guess if you can follow the directions it will be helpful but I stopped following it.",1283040000,4,158,3.96875
8319772,5,B001LTZ5KY,"My then fiancee and I got to know Kurt through his salsa dance class. Can attest he is as clear on instruction and funny as on the DVD. When we were ready to prepare for our wedding first dance, Instead of taking his wedding dance class, Kurt told us to buy the DVD and pick up the dance.

We got the DVD, chose Beautiful in White by Westlife as our dance song, and practiced. The modular nature of the DVD, plus the easy slow dance rhythm, made it easy for us to create our own choreography for the song. With practice made perfect, helped by the intuitive DVD layout and menu for jumping to each specific set of moves, we felt fully prepared, confident, and comfortable on the wedding day, and our guests were thrilled.",1470009600,,721,4.340740740740741
8319773,4,B001LTZ5KY,"Super, super cheesy. With that said...it is very helpful. If you don't have the time/money/desire to take a real dance class, this video will help you relax and learn the basics of a slow dance for your wedding.",1438732800,,211,4.578947368421052
8319774,5,B001LTZ5KY,I used this video to learn to dance for my wedding.  Me and my wife have never danced before like this and it was good.,1423699200,,119,3.76
8319775,4,B001LTZ5KY,"The video was rather simple but takes you step by step. If you have no other alternative and have no dance experience, this may help!",1417910400,,133,4.36
8319776,5,B001LTZ5KY,"I bought this for me and my then-fiance-now-husband to learn for our first dance at our wedding. The video is a bit cheesy, but fully aware of itself as such, so it's still enjoyable. They teach you various dance basics in nice easy bits, with tips on how to tie them all together and form your own dance. My husband (who is very much NOT a dancer) and I only had to watch it a handful of times before we had it down and felt confident. Our first dance was simple and classy, and our families were very impressed. They said we looked so at ease and comfortable, that it looked as though we had been dancing together for years. They were very surprised when we admitted we were complete beginners and winged the whole thing!",1400630400,,723,4.323529411764706
8319777,4,B001LTZ5KY,"My fiance and I are getting married late June, this year. He is career Army officer so I *assumed* he could find a beat, heck he marches. I learned he hasn't yet, despite watching that chapter (he does have a hearing loss in his and the DVD's defense.) Thank goodness they have a special 'find the beat' chapter.

He tells me he loves the DVD.  I have an extensive dance background; I'm disappointed with the very basic/ pedestrian dance routine that we can develop using their steps. But as a couple this maybe as much as we can do together for our upcoming wedding.  If we lived in the same place/ had more time we would do a lot of privet lessons. But we don't so thank goodness we have DVD's, I have a lot of hope riding on this DVD.

The DVD helps me focus on positive confidence building so I am appreciative of them telling both of us what to do as we following their instructions.  No hurt feelings or fighting yet!

Overall I maybe was expecting too much, this is good for the basics, my vote would be 2-3 stars. He would rank it 4-5 stars because he really likes the DVD and is not intimidated by it.  Since he watches it between our practices sessions without me, I am giving it a 4 star.

I will update my review with our progress.

Good tips about the shoes and preventing he or me from messing up my dress and other embarrassing things found online these days.  I am hoping to update my review.",1400544000,,1408,4.2593984962406015
8319778,3,B001LTZ5KY,"I bought this because of the positive reviews.  However, this guy is no Fred Astaire.  He is kind of awkward and goofy and really doesn't look that good dancing.  So, trying to emulate him doesn't necessarily make you have much hope as he is the pro, yet is really kind of dorky.",1397433600,,279,4.326923076923077
8319779,5,B001LTZ5KY,"Pros:
- Fairly easy to explain and understand
- Couple is quite funny and makes learning the moves fun
- Targets novices but the overall effect looks pretty good
- Some cool moves (3 different dips).

Cons:
- I think the editing felt quite choppy and at times I had to watch it a few times to fully get it. But this would apply to any dance dvd.

Overall I think if you're looking for a simple, routine that you can piece together then this dvd is right for you. If you find your right song, determine how many beats per chorus/verse, and incorporate particular steps with the same number of beats per chorus/verse. You should use your judgement as to how a dance routine should fit into your song.

The DVD should not be used as 'teach me a routine and I'll just do that'. It should sync with your song. This DVD gives you a series of moves that you can piece together yourself.",1359936000,,879,4.283132530120482
8319780,5,B001LTZ5KY,My wife and I used it for prep for our wedding.  So easy!  The dances weren't difficult at all to learn.,1359590400,2,104,3.9047619047619047
8319781,5,B001LTZ5KY,"The Wedding Dance DVD was invaluable in teaching my wife and I to dance. Believe me, if we can do it, anyone can! We usually run for the hills as soon as the music came on at weddings. We finally decided it was time to learn to dance. This DVD taught several steps, easily done, that we actually enjoyed! Kurt is a fantastic teacher:  encouraging, kind and reassuring. And most of all, fun! We attended our dear friends' wedding last weekend and surprised ourselves with how much fun we had on the dance floor. Instead of hiding in the bathroom, we were strolling the floor enjoying ourselves and being part of the group. Thanks Kurt!!!",1344297600,,636,4.530434782608696
