8745638,4,B019P574BI,"The information said the product would ship from PA, but it actually shipped from Switzerland via Swiss post.  The box is in German and I was concerned that the DVD would be for region 2, but it seems to play normally so must be a region 1 DVD.

The memory stick that the 4k version comes on is not fast enough to play correctly on my new Samsung TV, but transferring the file to a fast stick worked fine (I think the coding is VBR, so a fast stick is needed for the transitions).  The 4k data rate is not as high as I would have liked (the file is just over 6 GB for about 45 minutes of play), but the motion scenes are very controlled so I was hard pressed to see any encoder artifacts.

Even though it was released in 2012, the 4k footage is truly awesome and gives you an idea of what 4k can look like.  I suspect this is because most of the scenes were shot in time lapse with a 5D mark II at full resolution and then downscaled to 4k.  Also, the Red camera used for the Slow Motion scenes was quite sharp.  The movie is presented in 24p, so on a computer there is some judder.  On the Samsung with the smooth motion feature turned on, the images are very sharp and glass smooth.  This movie is also available direct from the producer in New Zealand either as a download or on a flash stick at a higher data rate than this release, but it is more expensive and I don't think you get the DVD in the deal.",1458950400,5,1408,4.0359712230215825

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TimeScapes is the debut film from award-winning cinematographer and director Tom Lowe. The film features stunning slow-motion and time-lapse cinematography of the landscapes, people, and wildlife of the American South West. Tom Lowe spent 2 years roaming the Southwest with is Toyota pickup truck in shooting this spectacular film. Braving the conditions, he would camp out in places such as Yosemite, or Joshua Tree National Park, shooting the night sky, then editing the footage and uploading short films to the Vimeo web site. This led to a chance encounter on the internet with New Zealand composer and entrepreneur Nigel John Stanford. TimeScapes takes the viewer beyond the limits of time and space and into a state of spiritual rapture that leaves us not simply touched but totally transformed.

The path of Tom Lowe is totally fantastic and envy all video artists and amateur photographers, and because Tom Lowe is an American, who originally was totally unknown to the public, until people viewed some of his work on the Vimeo web site that showed some of his stunning time-lapse photography, which went onto generating few thousand views, and an achievement that germinated in Tom to pursue the project of this feature film. Conversing with the help of composer and producer Nigel John Stanford, the project really took shape and was sponsored by Canon. But for Tom Lowe decided to devote himself full time to his passion and directing this first feature film which he had always dreamed of creating!

Production involved many hardships, where Tom slept outdoors for 250 nights, sleeping on cots (without tents) under the stars next to his camera, while the time-lapse was being captured. TimeScapes takes the viewer beyond the limits of time and space and into a state of spiritual rapture that leaves us not simply touched but totally transformed and has managed to capture not only the visual but also the spiritual beauty of our world and for Tome Lowe time-lapse photography only really started out as a hobby.

The project took shape over a two year period, and Tom Lowe travelled mostly in the southwest of the United States with his Canon EOS SLR digital cameras and mini Red Digital Cameras to direct this first feature film, entirely of time lapses and slow-motion sequences. The special feature of the film was shot in 4K and the slow-motion sequences were performed using the Red Epic camera and the time-lapse sequences and Tom Lowe used his Canon DSLR 5D Mark II mainly.

This was a very small film in terms of the budget, so making it a very personal film for Tom Lowe, which was never going to be on the same scale of a Hollywood project. But this film is definitely worth viewing on this stunning Blu-ray disc, as it has totally exceptional filmic quality to show off the best of his photography, as TimeScapes has likewise marked the history of ultra-high definition since it was the first feature film to be marketed in 4K High Definition quality and is just as spectacular as you would see with any IMAX film. Aesthetically, the film has been described in the tradition of works by Ron Fricke like BARAKA and SAMSARA for which Tom Lowe dedicated in homage to Ron Fricke. The film can be best described as meditative visual journey, without words. Now and again you just get brief standard photographic images and I loved the shot of the beautiful brown bear sitting down and seem to be looking very forlorn and the final part of the film is where a young lady is walking through a massive spectacular blanket of something like bluebells, that stretches a massive distance towards a mountain range in the distance and sadly as the young lady walks off, the film then fades to inform us we have sadly come the end of Tom Lowes epic time-lapse photographic spectacular film. But of course what is so spectacular you experience is the totally awesome time-lapse photography and is absolutely without doubt exceptional, as well as very professionally presented and will certainly totally amaze you and especially if you are an enthusiastic amateur astrophotography like Tom Lowe. A visual singularity of a sort that would have made Carl Sagan very proud indeed.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented in this special edition in a stunning 1080p resolution image, with an equally impressive 1.78:1 aspect ratio, with images that will occupy the entire frame of what you will get with you viewing experience. The level of sharpness is totally outstanding and really excellent and also looks totally naturally. But can vary depending on the nature of the scenes and the images that appear more velvety on the slow-motion sequences via the Red Epic system, give a sort of quilted look, especially with some of the time-lapse sequences. Nevertheless, despite this, the benefits still remain totally excellent, and the colours are absolutely stunning and totally remarkable for the duration of the documentary. Filmed in 4K resolution on a Canon EOS and Red Digital Cameras and Edited in 4K on an Abode Premiere.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  All I can say is that the performance of this audio track is a stunning awesome experience, but would have been even more stunning if it had been in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, but despite this anomaly, it is still very impressive and awe inspiring. But of course it is helped along with the impressive constructed music soundtrack by composer Nigel John Stanford, who accompanies it so much with his brilliantly fabulous images for Tom Lowes stunning film, and offering a somewhat kind of impressionist dimension. This exclusively musical soundscape is so appropriate, without overdoing it, especially for your entire viewing and listening special pleasure and frankly it will not disappointment you at all, but again it would have been even more enhanced brilliantly if they had included a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track for sure, still despite this, it is still an impressive audio experiece.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Tom Lowe: Here Tom Lowe introduces himself and informs us that this is the audio commentary for TimeScapes. Tom also tells us that Nigel John Stanford designed the main title wording of TimeScapes at the start of the film and Nigel was inspired by the title sequence of the film ALIEN, but as you see the shadow decrease with the wording, Tom feels it reminded him of his time-lapse photography, and he really liked what Nigel had produced. As we go through the film, Tom explains in great detail why he did certain shots, and also tells in great detail where he filmed at all the locations. When we see the graceful pelicans coming into land onto the water, Tom tells us that he could watch and film them all day as he feels they are totally amazing very graceful birds, but he could also watch and film other kinds of bird, as it gives him the greatest joy in the world. As we go through the rest of the film, Tom tells us that with certain landscapes he filmed in time-lapse photography, Tom explains that they were filmed at night and the light that gradual crosses the landscape is created by the brightness of the moonlight from the moon as it emerges over the horizon, and you do not actually see the mon, only very briefly in some other shots. Also Tom loved going into great detail of what different lenses and cameras he used to create the magical images we see, especially with each location Tom filmed in and also goes into great detail how the different images came about, but now and again he does tend to repeat certain technical information, which is understandable, as it was such a personal project he had always want to pursue, but despite this, Tom is a really nice guy and I would sure love to meet him personally and shake his hand to congratulate him on such an awesome project, especially the 2 years of his life travelling around different parts of America, as I love his enthusiasm and total dedication for making such stunning time-lapse photography, that is just as professional as an any IMAX films I have in my Blu-ray Collection and I definitely class this film as an IMAX experience. So all in all Tom is again such a really nice guy and was a joy to listen to his very personal audio commentary. So enjoy my friends!

Special Feature: The Making of TimeScapes [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [18.28] This is an excellent special feature documentary that makes you understand how this brilliant project came into being to produce this Tom Lowe TimeScapes project and especially how it was all achieved. We get a truly intimate insight into the world of Tom Lowe, as he informs us how it all came about, which originally just started out as a hobby of getting into time-lapse photography and we also get to see extensive look behind-the-scenes on how he captured the spectacular images. But it only came about when Tom was able to get hold of a 4K Canon EOS Camera and also the Red Digital Camera, and Tom felt no one had really tacked time-lapse photography properly that he has personally produced, and it also all came about when he personally built his own dolly set-up. We also get to see Nigel John Stanford who took about his personal input into the film TimeScapes and we also get to see some of Nigels own personal time-lapse photography of Stars Bora Bora Timelapse that was filmed in his native country of New Zealand. We are now back with Tom Lowe who talks how very dedicated he is about setting up particular shots, which we get to see Tom in action, with some of his friends that tagged along with him and we also get to see how rough they slept, but Tom personally didn't mind that as he felt total freedom. Tom then talks extensively of most of the locations he visited and especially ones he found that no one else has filmed before, especially in Arizona and the spectacular rock formation he called the Holy Land because as you will see they are extremely strange rock formation that are equally beautiful and strange at the same time to look at. Tom also enjoyed filming in Yosemite Park, as it was a totally rich environment of totally spectacular scenery and especially finding areas that had not been filmed before. We also get to see Tom working on the technical aspect of filming in 4K on his computer, but he had to contact the Light Iron Company in Hollywood, California to help Tom finish off his project to make it look even more stunning. As Toms project was up and running, loads of people contacted him via different networks asking if they could join him at the different locations he visited and in the end about 20 people joined him for part of the journey, especially taking lots of photographs of what views he was filming. After a 2 year journey he wondered if his project would be a success and indeed it did. Tom also hopes the film he has produced will bring lots of joy and happiness which it has, and Tom also hopes his film will inspire other budding time-lapse photographers out there to pursue their dreams like he has.

Special Feature: Behind the Music [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13.24] Nigel John Stanford adopts with this project as both the producer and composer. He explains here how he designed and composed the soundtrack via his computer. This particular special feature is an extension to the previous special feature The Making of TimeScapes and especially in having a very intimate insight into Nigel John Stanford and the he works composing music scores and goes into great detail of the process of doing the music score for TimeScapes. Nigel informs us that he uses a special computer entitled Digital Audio Work Station from the CUBASE6: Advance Music Production System Company, and makes the job so easy when mixing the music and sound effects together, and shows us how musical instruments can be produced, and the first thing Nigel shows us his Emotional Piano and you get to hear a very realistic sound of a piano and so over time he builds up with lots of other muscular instruments and voices of humans, that again can be accessed from his super computer and over a period of time he eventually brings everything together we hear the actual musical score for part of the TimeScape film that you also get to see and how it all came together. Despite it being a very short special feature, it is long enough to explain to us the mysteries of composing music for modern day audiences.

Special Feature: Production Photos [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6.31] This is totally superb, and here we are given a very special slide show of photographs and also taking us behind-the-scenes of filming TimeScapes, but now and again you get small excerpts from the action film inserted between each spectacular 1080p photographs. Another bonus you get is the stunning composed music score of Nigel John Stanford, which gives this Production Photos a totally awesome spectacular professional presentation. So well don Tom Lowe, you are the best!

Special Feature: Film Credits [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:20] This is just a repeat of the credits you see at the very end of the film, especially telling you who was involved in the making of the film TimeScapes.

Finally, TimeScapes is a fabulous project of truly exceptional professional film viewing experience. The photography with the new technologies of enthusiastic Tom Lowe, gives all nature lovers an amazing experience on every level and especially since this 4K film was the result of a personal project of Tom Lowe and was completely finalised in 4K, which again gives you a totally awesome experience and also makes this Blu-ray a totally stunning tour-de-force image experience, that will blow you away. Time-lapse photography with TimeScapes is a totally artistic expression of pure joy and also a totally brilliant perfection to experience. However, TimeScapes has not been filmed to be an entertaining blockbuster; instead Tom Lowe wants to show you the beauty of motion pictures either in slow-motion or time-lapse compressed views. Tom Lowe in my humble opinion is a fascinating expression of art and for anyone interested in cinematographic art it is a must see and possibly one of the best works of 2012 when it was originally released. Bravo to the creator Tom Lowe! Very Highly Recommended!
