This is the only movie that my grandfather ever took my grandmother to....and I don't know if it was the silent film or not.....but he used to sing it all the time.....I have not opened the package yet  'cause I was saving it for a gift for mom and haven't given it to her yet"".  it looks like it's in original packaging.",1393804800,2,353,4.086956521739131
4858912,5,B005QJ8W9Q,The only way I can rate this is because it made my Aunt very happy to get this movie for a Christmas Gift. She had wanted to see it for years because she had been named after a character in the movie. I had searched before and found a different movie with the same title but it was a very wrong movie. My Aunt said she never watched all of it and threw it away. I didn't get a chance to watch this new movie with her but she loved to finally see her namestake. It is always fun to actually give a gift that the receiver likes!,1391817600,,526,3.8796296296296298

the cover art work was amateurish and uninformative
the disc was loose in the case sliding all around
poor packaging
the DVD-R disc did not play on my playback only device
poor customer service------was not able to get satisfactory compensation and consideration;  had to appeal to Amazon

Somewhat melodramatic story, but beautifully photographed and they did a good job of keeping the color realistic looking. A very young Loretta Young is lovely to look at.",1442188800,,267,4.955555555555556

They two fall passionately in love amidst a sea of disapproval and head west to forge a new trail which they do most fantastically until tragedy strikes.
