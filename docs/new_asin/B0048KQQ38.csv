8418756,5,B0048KQQ38,"Basilicata Coast to Coast is a kind of Armata Brancaleone of our times. I think Monicelli would permit me to make such an approach.  Lyrical sometimes, sometimes picaresque,  with a certain amount of naivet we were longing for, after so many ""action"" movies by Hollywood. Many thanks to Amazon for delivering  me this moving masterpiece.",1411516800,,337,5.090909090909091
