3618180,5,B001GP5TJ0,This is a fantastic collection from the Wagon Train TV series. It is a 16 disc set and is well worth the money. The picture and sound quality are excellent. These are classic TV westerns and I only hope they will put ALL of the Wagon Train episodes out on DVD.,1231977600,11,260,4.117647058823529
3618181,5,B001GP5TJ0,"One of abc's first generation of 'in color' live action series (from 1961-63 the network colorcast cartoons: The Jetsons, Cecil And Beany, Top Cat, and The Flintstones) looks good on DVD. The prints don't appear to be restored, but have decent color and are generally clear. It is great that the entire season of thirty-two 90 minute episodes was released in one mega-boxset. Next: The Virginian released on disc?",1229990400,5,413,5.0
3618182,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Wagon Train after so many years.
The boxed set was good value and hopefully there will be more to come in the future.",1229904000,4,147,4.481481481481482
3618183,5,B001GP5TJ0,"Beautifully remasters and the interviews were wonderful.  So many fond days came back of all those great old tv westerns of yesteryear.  The old time belief that they were too violent, geez, they are mild compared with the stuff they show on tv.  These were tame, taught good lessons and it's a shame more of them are not available to show to our children and grandchildren.  The days of the westerns seem to be over, what a loss and shame, but thank goodness to such people as those at Timeless to bring back those gold old westerns.  I wish I could list a bunch more I'd love to see to share with my family.  I'm glad I lived through that magical period, tv was worth watching back then.",1229299200,48,689,4.34375
3618184,5,B001GP5TJ0,"There was a time back in the 1950s and '60s when primetime network programming relied so much on Westerns that nearly every night of the week featured at least one. While some rode off into the sunset without much ado, one of the best, and longest-running, ""Wagon Train,"" set the bar for style and authenticity that few other Western series ever achieved.

This DVD set, all 3,900 minutes of it, presents the 1963 season -- all 32 90-minute episodes filmed in color, as well as 16 classic episodes (black and white) from the series' other seven seasons. The show, based on the legendary John Ford Western feature film ""Wagon Master,"" starred Ward Bond (who reprised his role from the Ford film), John McIntire, Robert Horton, Robert Fuller, Frank McGrath, Terry Wilson, Denny Scott Miller and Michael Burns. Each week the show told the stories of a wagon train heading west from Missouri to California in the days following the Civil War.

What set the series apart from many of its contemporaries was the show's impeccable attention to details: Most of the actors were trained horsemen or cowboys; set dressings and wardrobe were as authentic as possible, and nearly every minute of it was filmed on location across California and surrounding states, which took the West out of the backlot and into, well, the West.

""The Western on television was so successful because it appealed to the entire family,"" said Fuller, who joined the cast in 1963 as the wagon train's scout Cooper Smith (he replaced Robert Horton), fresh from his starring role in another Western series, ""Laramie."" ""At the end of a hard day of work and school, the family could all watch the show together and escape from the worries of the day. I know it sounds corny, but it was true.""

It took seven days to film each 90-minute episode, Fuller said, and almost all of it was location work. ""We shot a lot in Lone Pine [California] up north and Thousand Oaks, which back then actually had 1,000 oaks [trees],"" he said, laughing.

""There's no way a Western series could be filmed the way we did 'Wagon Train,'"" Fuller added. ""No way. First of all, there are no picture horses left. Back in the day, there were two large horse ranches in Hollywood that had 1,000 picture horses apiece. These horses were trained to stand still in front of a camera, do falls, tricks, move to a mark on cue. And many of the guys who did these shows were real cowboys. They were all Western riders. They're all gone now.""

That attention to detail and realism it was set ""Wagon Train"" apart from its contemporaries, including ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke.""

""No other series attempted a full season of 90-minute episodes in color because the budget was outrageous for the day,"" Fuller said. ""And look at the wardrobe on 'Bonanza.' All those tailored, made-to-fit clothes. Look at those great-looking pants that Michael Landon wore (laughs) -- and they never got dirty. 'Gunsmoke' was shot entirely on a soundstage. Those shows were good, but we were worlds apart.""

Fuller would go on to star in numerous television series and guest star on countless others, most notably ""Emergency!"" in which he starred as Dr. Kelly Brackett for seven years in the 1970s. He now makes his home on a sprawling ranch in Texas with his wife, actress Jennifer Savidge (""St. Elsewhere"").

""I think this DVD set is really going to make a lot of folks very happy, folks who remember the show from their youth,"" Fuller said. ""But I also think it's gonna make a whole new generation see what television could do very well, and what an important, exciting series 'Wagon Train' was""",1227225600,130,3600,4.756410256410256

3618217,5,B001GP5TJ0,This series rates as one of my favorite westerns. I only wish every season could have been filmed in color as was season 7.,1388016000,,123,4.166666666666667
3618218,5,B001GP5TJ0,Love the old westerns from the late 1950s to 1960s. All the DVD's were great. Did not care the three at the end with Ward Bond. I had all of these. Enjoyed the interviews with Scott Miller and Robert Fuller. Overall a very good DVD set.,1387411200,,236,4.1521739130434785
3618219,5,B001GP5TJ0,"Black and white or colour, Wagon Train remains the one family western that tops them all.  A huge set that takes awhile to get through, but well worth the trip",1383868800,,159,4.3
3618220,5,B001GP5TJ0,"This was a great series.  It was well written, produced and great story lines.  This series should hve been done in color before the seventh season.  The color does enhance this TV show.  i recommend this series for any avid collector of the DVD world.  I have all eight (8) seasons ot this series.  With all of the great guest stars and story lines this show could have lasted as long as Gunsmoke.",1383868800,,398,4.383561643835616
3618221,5,B001GP5TJ0,I went with this rating because Wagon Train was an absolute favorite of our entire family.  We would all watch,1380672000,,110,4.5
3618222,3,B001GP5TJ0,"Whenever you get DVDs of a TV series always remember the 5/6th rule: The DVD of each episode should come to about five-sixth the time of the show's original time slot length. Thus a half-hour show should run 25 minutes on DVD, with the commercials out. An hour show should run 50 minutes. And a 90 minute show should run one hour and 15 minutes. Any less most likely means that material has been cut out, usually in the syndication package, and thus the DVD has been made from the syndication package rather than the original. And particularly check the end credits to see the list of actors and characters. If you see actors or characters in the credits that you just didn't see at all in the show, it means WAY too much has been cut. I'm only on Episode 6 so far, but I can see that some actors listed for The Myra Marshall Story (for instance, I. Stanford Jolley as the doctor) are nowhere to be seen, meaning all their scenes were cut. And so far every episode is running at only about 1:08, not 1:15. Seven missing minutes is too much. The scripts and acting are of high quality, though I'm a bit bothered by the anti-Native American undertones of The Robert Harrison Clarke Story, something I had not seen to such an extent in the series' previous seasons (or, for the most part, on other Westerns). And I'm glad to see all the episodes anyway; just wish they had used the original episodes and not cut material out or used the syndication package.",1379548800,4,1454,4.42910447761194
3618223,5,B001GP5TJ0,"the seventh  season of wagon train was my favorite because i was old enough to remember it,and the only season in color and 90 minutes great to add to any wagon train collection and the price was great",1373414400,,201,4.2894736842105265
3618224,5,B001GP5TJ0,Wagon Train was a regular on TV in our house when I was growing up.  It's a fond piece of my childhood and so great to enjoy the series once more.  Thank you for making this available!,1365638400,,184,3.945945945945946
3618235,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I did not watch the dvd, but the recipient of this gift said it was enjoyed very much.  The picture and content was of very
good quality and enjoyment.  The program brought back many old memories to when the TV show was first aired, but watching in color was even more appreciated.",1364256000,,281,4.384615384615385

3618238,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I never got to see Wagon Train on network TV because I was a hair too young but I remember the color episodes from way back when TBN used to own what is now the ABC Family channel and used to run Saturday and Sunday at the westerns. Because I was, am and always will be horse crazy I'd tune into them for the horses and for Cooper Smith (Robert Fuller). These episodes are like comfort food for me and they in great shape, considering their age. The bonus of having episodes from all the other seasons makes this money well spent.",1355270400,,530,4.205882352941177
3618239,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I had forgotten how good these old westerns were.  We need shows like these now instead of the crap that is on.  The color was good, when this was on we still had a black & white TV. This is the first time I have seen them in color. The landscape was terrific, makes me want to go west again.

3618240,3,B001GP5TJ0,"I just purchased ""Wagon Train-The Complete Season Seven"" at Walmart earlier today for $19.96.  It contains the same 32 color episodes as ""The Complete Color Season"" and the interviews, but minus the black and white bonus episodes. The other difference is that it is now an 8-disc set with 4 episodes per disc. These are the complete 90 minute episodes though. Copyright on the DVD set is 2012 by Timeless Media.

Notes on back of the set indicate that these 32 color episodes from the 7th season are fully restored from the original NBC Universal masters. The colors still seem a little faded with a little grain, but quite good.

So, if you want to look to save a lot of money, check for the new 2012 reissued set.",1341014400,7,715,4.5271317829457365
3618241,3,B001GP5TJ0,"I am familiar with all of the color episodes backwards and forwards and was very disappointed to watch these great episodes cut. When TV 38 use to show reruns in the early seventies, they were shown complete. The prints themselves could use some cleaning up as well and color saturation could be touched up. And why give 16 episodes frome earlier seasons when you can buy the complete seasons that those are in? It would have been much better if they had simply put out the color episodes complete and uncut and left the earlier ones where they belong, in thier respective seasons. However, I love the packaging in the embossed boxes of the earlier seasons. In any case, it's good to have WAGON TRAIN out on DVD for command veiwings. Hopefully they will re-work the color episodes and re-release them in the tin-box to make the entire series consistant in the package design.",1337126400,2,875,4.688311688311688
3618242,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I am going to go over board and state that this was the most satisfying DVD purchase that I have ever made. Everything is superb: the packaging,story lines, video and audio quality. I would say that this series is a classic example of what family TV viewing should be.",1331856000,,268,4.489795918367347
3618243,5,B001GP5TJ0,"Wagon Train was a landmark show. These color episodes pick up the series after the cast changes occasioned by the untimely death of the magnificent Ward Bond. John McIntire, an actor of immense talent and presence in his own right, was a superb replacement for Bond. This set is an invaluable addition to the collection of iconic and memorable American television.",1330041600,,364,4.983606557377049

3618270,5,B001GP5TJ0,"The ""Wagon Train:  Complete Final Season in Color"" is a great DVD box set.

the only problem that I can point out is the packaging.  I would like the packaging to have been better.  I don't like packages with overlapping DVD discs.  There is too much of a risk for accidently scratching and ruining the DVD disc when the DVD disc are packed this way.

However, the contents on the DVD discs themselves are great.

""Wagon Train"" went to color in the final season with 90 minute episodes.

Robert Fuller from ""Laramie"" and later on ""Emergincy"" was brought in a the character Wagon Train Scout Cooper Smith (Coop).  He joined the then regular cast members of the TV series:

John McIntire as Chris Hale, Wagon Master

Frank McGrath as Wagon Train Cook Charlie Wooster

Terry Mills as Bill Hawks

Scott Miller as Wagon Train Scout Duke Shannon

Some of the Special Guest Stars appearing in episodes are Rhonda Flemming, Ronal Reagan, Barbara Stenwick, Burgeous Merridith, Dick York, Dick Sergeant, and others.

They do not make TV shows of this caliber anymore.  This is definitely a DVD set worth looking into.

I did not like the packaging of the DVD set, but I got to give it 5 stars, because the show is way too great to give it anything less.",1270252800,4,1243,4.577272727272727

We like the newer ones and the older ones.  The biggest problem we have had with the product is the packaging.  You can barely get the dvds out of the holders.  You practically tear them up getting them out.  I am putting all of them in separate paper holders and then in a different box, so I don't struggle with not bending or breaking them everytime I try to take them out of the package.  Did anyone else out there have this problem?

I'm not a Bible-beater, but I hate most of the crap on TV nowadays.  I loved this show as a kid, and now, as soon as the theme song comes on, I'm catapulted back to that much more simple time, with no swearing or nudity or lewd behavior - just good old fashioned morals and a happy ending.

It's almost as much fun waiting to see who the guest star is going to be on each episode as it is to watch the guys who were the regulars on the show.  (It was good to see all of them again.)  The thing I like the best and had forgotten is that a lot of the shows don't really happen around the wagon train.  Someone's always ""venturing off"" the trail"" and the show takes place in a new place.  I've ordered lots of westerns from that time period and I've enjoyed them all too, but watching W.T., you can see that it was way ahead of it's time as for quality and entertainment.  You won't be sorry if you order this and love westerns or ANY of the MANY actors of that time.  It sure takes you back to a gentler time.",1240185600,8,992,3.9646464646464645
3618338,4,B001GP5TJ0,"Yes, I must say it was like watching my favorite show back in the 60's again! I do not have any complaints! The only thing I wished they had done was provide more shows with Ward Bond, but they said they couldn't I guess because they were too old or couldn't be restored for viewing? Anyhow, I highly recommend wagon train!",1238371200,4,323,4.311475409836065

3618340,5,B001GP5TJ0,"Wow! I'm impressed!  This is exactly the show I grew up with. On high quality DVD with great sound and color.  All of my old friends are back and the West is still untamed. A full season of ""Wagon's ho!"" awaits your ears. These are the Ward Bond episodes on 16 DVDs. I'm in heaven.",1235088000,6,281,4.090909090909091
3618341,5,B001GP5TJ0,"I bought this last night at Sams Club for $49.88.  I wonder if it was mis-marked.  Seems kind of cheap.

Also, if you bought the previous set of Wagon Train Going West that contained 12 episodes, none of those episodes are repeated in the bonus black and white episodes of the color season.

I haven't had a chance to watch any of the color shows yet.

3618343,5,B001GP5TJ0,"The new DVD rendition of Wagon Train is a wonderful, nostalgic trip back to the past when the good guys were good and the bad were bad.  It is so much fun to see so many actors and actresses, now in their prime, when their careers were often just beginning.
The main characters are a delight to watch even though by standards today the action can appear stilted.",1233187200,5,362,4.323529411764706

8306513,2,B001GP5TJ0,"some episodes are very good, some fair. but i gave it 2 stars because of the quality of the video (good, but not remastered like Bonanza or Gunsmoke) and the fact that there is no time counter on these discs, meaning if you watch half an episode and stop the disc, it will not remember where you left off. most other dvds have the memory counter and i can stop watching and resume when i please without having to fast forward to the part i left it. I can't believe including this function would have raised the price of the disc much. I am not a fan of Timeless Media whereas i bought the dvd set THE REBEL and the transfers were poor quality, some unwatchable!",1505088000,,661,4.253968253968254
