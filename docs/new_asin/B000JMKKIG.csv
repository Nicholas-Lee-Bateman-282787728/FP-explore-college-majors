8152463,5,B000JMKKIG,"To date, this movie is the only movie directed by Rahul Bose, who was anointed by Time magazine as the ""Superstar of Indian Arthouse Cinema"".  It is a really offbeat, cerebral, English language movie, introduced first at the annual Toronto Film Festival in 2001,and features some recognizable names like Pooja Bhatt and Boman Irani, besides Rahul himself.  It also stars Rahul's real-life former lover of 4 years, Koel Purie, a fantastic actress, who never hit it big, and now seems to have dropped out of the acting scene after her marriage to a Frenchman.  This movie is an Alternate Cinema classic, a must for those who appreciate arthouse cinema.  Very highly recommended.",1357430400,,676,5.008928571428571
