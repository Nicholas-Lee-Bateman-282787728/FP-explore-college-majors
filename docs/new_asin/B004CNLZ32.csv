8423293,5,B004CNLZ32,"I am really not going to know how this works out till spring as it was purchased as a gift for my Niece and she won't be getting in the pool for a few more months.  She had neck surgery last year and used to be a runner.  I told her to try this as it will be a much better way for her to get her exercise in without getting hurt, sore, or injured.  So we'll see.",1386979200,,362,3.6153846153846154
8423294,4,B004CNLZ32,I have been teaching AquaFitness for over 30 years and recently included the Water Horse in my Men's  Deep Water Aqua program.  The feed back was very positive as many felt that they liked this product better than a noodle.  The men were all wearing their deep water belts and spent at least 20 minutes on the Water Horse in the deep water before returning to the shallow were they continued doing core work. I haven't read the Water Horse Workout book as I have my own routines and exercise programs.,1385424000,,501,4.483516483516484
8423295,4,B004CNLZ32,"I lent my water horse to three people in my shallow/deep combo class. Two loved it. They said it was better than the belt they had been using. The third didn't like it. She admitted she was too large for it to fit and that she didn't have the core control to stay verticle Me? I prefer shallow workouts so don't need it.
As to the video, it shows some good exercises.",1362787200,,367,4.111111111111111
8423296,2,B004CNLZ32,"I purchased the Water Horse Workout in hopes of gaining better flotation control in an outdoor heated pool as part of a self-directed aqua therapy program.  Being 5 feet tall in an outdoor pool with the same depth is at best challenging to stay afloat and in control, even with floatation belt support and aqua noodles.

Core and flexibility prior to a bad fall were non-issues for me given regular pilates, stretching, stength training and cardio workouts (with prior yoga & jazz training).  I had hoped that Water Horse would aid me in further core strengthening in my rehabilitation; however, it did not. Instead, I stopped after two uses to avert further injury.

I did research and rely on product reviews before my purchase.  This is why I decided to write this review as the Water Horse is a relatively expensive item and non-refundable.  I'm sure that this would work well for otherwise healthy individuals, and my review is simply based on a 55+ years old female who was looking to add some fun and excitement in my 120 minutes per week aqua program.

There is a happy ending: I am now in a zero-gravity AQX suit and even able to jog in the pool for a fantastic overall body and core workout 2-3 times a week.",1338163200,2,1218,4.585253456221198
