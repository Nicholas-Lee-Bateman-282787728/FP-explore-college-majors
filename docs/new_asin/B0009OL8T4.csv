The director skillfully used above average outdoor camera angles of horseback riding on some hilly and rough, brushy locations to add western ruggedness. Tyler is a strong, effective leading man in his westerns.",1511049600,,332,4.842105263157895

8064147,3,B0009OL8T4,"I had to chuckle at another reviewer's comments about bullets flying everywhere and none hitting anything.  I would say in the genre of old cowboy movies, this one does take the blue ribbon in that category.
However, I do not watch these movies for their critical acclaim - or lack thereof.  I had seen Tom Tyler in some of his Three Mesquiteers movies and searched my way through several other of his movies.  This was one, and I enjoyed it.  In many of these older movies, there is certainly a strong element of overlap in acting and emotional expression from the silent era.  I get a kick out of that.  It adds a certain dated element to the performance.  I found myself entertained by this movie, and that's about all I could ask.  The plot is not terribly complicated.  There are some true characters among the cast.  Just entertaining.",1465689600,,841,4.583892617449664

8064150,3,B0009OL8T4,"For as old as this low budget movie is you need to give it some consideration for lasting as long as it has.  I thought is was watchable even through the quality of the film was so bad, and even the acting could have been better.  My main issue with the movie was that hundreds of bullets were fired by virtually everyone but only a couple of them his anyone.  Even the hero was flinging his gun like a wipe and missing his target, but I guess that was important back in 1930's, along with the rolled up jeans.

I will give it three stars or a grade of C-.",1453593600,,556,4.027272727272727

8064152,4,B0009OL8T4,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""RIDIN' ON"" (29 February 1936) (56 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Tom Tyler was an American actor in silent and sound motion pictures --- He was born Vincent Markowski, into a Polish-American family --- Tyler had a long career in film, stretching from the 1920s to the 1950s, and appeared in many films, most of them westerns such as John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" --- He occasionally took ""civilian"" roles in feature films (he's the boxing referee in Abbott and Costello's ""Buck Privates""), but the biggest part of Tyler's screen career was spent making low-budget B-movie westerns for modest salaries --- Most of his budget westerns were made by Reliable Pictures for producers Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb.

Larger studios cast the athletic Tyler in rugged roles --- In 1940, he was the Mummy ""Kharis"" in ""The Mummy's Hand"" --- In the first film adaptation of a comic-strip superhero, Tyler had the title role in the 1941 film serial ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"", and starred as one of The Three Mesquiteers in Republic's series of western features.

In 1943, he starred in ""The Phantom"", based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip --- Tyler personified the role, looking especially striking in the character's familiar costume, and much of the serial's great success was due to Tyler himself. It was Tom Tyler's last major screen role --- One of my favorite serials is ""The Phantom of the West"" (1930), was billed as the ""all talking serial"" which is still available through Amazon or VCI Entertainment, great action plus harding riding and fighting scenes with Tom Tyler in the middle and riding in and out of danger.

There is little doubt that Tyler was a shy man most of his life, but he was also a man of inner confidence, willing to take on huge risks within his own abilities over and over again --- Tyler had a tremendous work ethic and enjoyed working hard for what he believed in --- from the weight room to learning his craft in acting --- Tom was a major ""B-Western"" cowboy star and while simultaneously working as a western hero, he was also a weight-lifting champion --- Tyler was once considered the strongest man in America, he won the national AAU weight-lifting championship in 1928 (he lifted 760 lbs.) and made the 1928 U.S. Olympic team.

Tyler was beset by rheumatoid arthritis in the later part of his career, and was limited to occasional supporting roles. Nearly destitute, he returned to live with his sister in the Detroit area, dying there of heart failure at the age of 50 in 1954 -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

8064153,3,B0009OL8T4,"Likeable Western star Tom Tyler stars in this ultra low budget(Reliable Studios)oater as a cowpoke returning home only to find himself caught in the middle of a family fued. His family is on one side of the river (which we never see)and the family of the girl he loves is on the other side. It turns out that some ranch hands hired by Tom's father are really behind the cattle rustling and murders, but Tom sorts it all out in 55 minutes and gets to marry the girl(Geraldine Greer aka Joan Barclay) reuniting the two families.
This film is certainly a passable way to kill an hour, but you've seen it all before, and done much better. The first 45 minutes are spent riding around dusty roads, up and down various hills and in and out of sagebrush. Several potshots are taken at Tom and gunfire is exchanged from behind the few rocks available. Continuity is nonexistent.
The big climax in the last 10 minutes moves onto a town set where everyone scrambles about and sometimes we're not really sure who just shot who, but Tom rides for help and the good guys win.
The Alpha dvd is choppy, but not too bad, and has audio hissing and sprocket noise at places...but let's face it, it hardly seems likely that this little B-Western will ever be restored and so we must be thankful for Alpha actually making it available for viewing in the first place.
Recommended for fans of Tom Tyler and really cheap cowboy movies. Others may be disappointed.",1205020800,,1440,4.542307692307692
