8750038,5,B00ADYIY4W,"Great episode in the longrunning TV series!! We who are addicted to Abarenbo Shogun have been watching dreadful VHS copies of the series, even paying outrageous prices for dvd copies of them, and very glad to have them. Only one dvd of the series has been released, 6 episodes from season 1, outrageously overpriced as well, but at least good quality pictures, you would think the owners of these over 25 years of TV treasures would see the potential goldmine if not the anguish of the fans, and release the entire series!! (English subtitles please)
Anyway,  we have 5 movie length episodes on dvd at reasonable prices. This is one of the best. A cute storyline, the usual well-loved characters, and of course magnificent sword play climaxed by Matsudaira Ken as Yoshimune Tokaguawa and his ninjas dispensing justice on the bad guys. And Yoshimune is left sadder but wiser. I won't tell you what happens to his 'bride'.
A very good story, one of over 800 episodes of the longest running tv series in the world. Buy it without delay.",1447977600,3,1033,4.738888888888889
