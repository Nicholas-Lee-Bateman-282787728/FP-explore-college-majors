8347675,4,B001XRLXC8,"This is the latest of this epic adventure story brought to the screen again by Peter Jackson with a great cast, story, music and cinematography.  His outstanding recreation of  NYC in the thirties is worth the price of the ticket.  You feel like you are there!

Skull Island is brought to life by outstanding CG on a unforgettable journey with Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody while introducing Jamie Bell in a break out roll.  This portion of the movie mergers King Kong with Jurassic Park which is true to the original story as I knew as a child.

This two disc edition provides a second disc relating to the making of the epic in the various locations.
The score and the cinematography alone makes this film one you need to have in your library.",1403654400,,753,4.54074074074074
