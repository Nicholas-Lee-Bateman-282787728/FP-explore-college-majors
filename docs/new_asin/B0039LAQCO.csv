8392083,3,B0039LAQCO,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2007 and directed/written by Donn Kennedy, Backwoods Bloodbath (subtitled The Curse of the Black Hodag) chronicles events when six college youths from Milwaukee take a Fall vacation to the Black Forest in Oneida County, Northern Wisconsin, but are unaware that the areas cursed by a half-human, half-creature called the Hodag.

This is an independent slasher flick in the mold of the Friday the 13th sequels, but hampered by a budget of somewhere around $10,000-$50,000 and the typical problems that come with micro-budget fare: bad acting, sometimes bad sound, hand-held cameras, dubious editing, etc. However, if you can handle these kinds of limitations and roll with it rather than against it, Backwoods Bloodbath delivers the goods in several respects. For one, the movie has a sense of humor and I busted out laughing several times (e.g. ""You guys aren't FIBs?"" and the following textual note).

Secondly, the movie delivers with a few quality females, starting with the barn brunette in the prologue and, about 25 minutes later, a tent-camping girl in red bikini-shorts, which is just a cameo. The main protagonist, Jessica, is pretty decent as well. Personally, I could do without the flashes of nudity though.

Thirdly, theres a lot of fairly convincing gore; and sometimes so much that its laughable (not that Im into gore, Im just pointing out that its done very well for a no-budget flick). Fourthly, the script throws in a surprise in the last act, which I won't give away. Fifthly, there are several quality cuts on the soundtrack by presumably local artists, like Whiskey Morning by 8 Hours of Violence (see the Soundtracks credits on IMDb for more info).

Sixth, the director/writer knows how to make a movie, as far as camera angles, editing, music, flow, etc. go. Sure, you can harp on this or that (which is easy to do with a no-budget flick), but the movie accomplishes its goal, its entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game. For comparison, my wife & I saw a no-budget horror flick recently that cost less than $10,000 and it totally siphoned from beginning to end, lacking all the six positives noted above (!).

On the downside (beyond the typical issues with these kinds of independent productions), the movies overlong by about ten minutes, with a useless epilogue/montage tacked on, theres too much juvenile crudity (although some of its amusing) and the second half doesnt generate enough suspense. Nevertheless, if you don't mind independent flicks with miniscule non-budgets, Backwoods Bloodbath is worth checking out for the highlights noted above.

THE MOVIE RUNS 89 minutes and was shot in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, with additional stuff done in Brookfield and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.

8392085,2,B0039LAQCO,"Mourning the death of Eric, six big city college students from Milwaukee head up the northern woods to rent a cabin to blow off steam. There is the normal minor tension within the group. The area is pestered by a ""Hodag"" which is Seth Chilsen in a rubber reptile mask and bad hair pretending to be Gunnar Hansen.

This is a rank amateur Wisconsin product with local flavor, songs, and cheese. The film has very little plot to write about. Normally these types of films plug a local band when they visit a bar. Now part of a film 4-pack.
