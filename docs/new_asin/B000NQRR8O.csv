Great opportunity for your child to get moving, learn their alphabet, basic mathematics, and so much more!  Its nice to have a character that my kids can relate to and not even realize they are learning while having fun!  And this is a steal of a deal!",1459987200,,330,4.290322580645161
8180720,5,B000NQRR8O,My 5 year old loves Rodney Raccoon!  He was so excited to get this!  I can not reccomend this enough!!!  The message that is sent to kids is very positive and in a tune that the kids can associate with.  Kids love to dance and move and rapping Rodney Raccoon gets them to do just that!,1187136000,,285,4.035714285714286
