8162983,4,B000LP4QC2,I'm pregnant with my first baby.  I was put on bed-rest and was worried that I would not be able to attend a baby care class that I signed up for.  I bought the DVD as a back up but was able to attend the class anyway.  I can say that this DVD covered just about everything I learned in the class but the class was twice the price.  The DVD would have been a pretty good substitue afterall.,1246060800,,390,3.8987341772151898
