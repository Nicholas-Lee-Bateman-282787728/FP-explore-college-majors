8618611,4,B00FUABGV2,"plot: Marina Oswald's life and side of the Assignation of President Kennedy.

This is a docudrama. Lee Harvey Oswald was in the marines and started reading Marx and is fast turning pro communism. He ends up in the Soviet Union and gives up his American Citizenship and his passport. the KGB assigns him a job in Minsk in a radio factor where he meets Pharmacist Marina. (HELENA BONHAM CARTER). They marry and soon with Marina pregnant Oswald comes back to America with her. This shows Marina as a lovely young girl who spoke little English who ends up living with a teacher who spoke some Russian. Oswald is unstable, controlling, domineering and focuses on his own desires to kill someone important. The focus on this one is Marina and how she lived before and after Oswald and the strain on her two daughters from Oswald. It shows the FBI as bullies Marina who grows as she matures and learns better english.  Bonham Carter is excellent as the beautiful and sometimes sad figure of Marina and the story she has to tell. Interesting and entertaining. Very good look into at a very *unstable* Oswald and his drive to kill. I give it 4 stars~",1504915200,,1141,4.615763546798029

8618616,5,B00FUABGV2,"As much as there is a lot of specualtion about the murder of President Kennedy , and his murderer  ( Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald) , this motion picture is strongly providing the another point of view. The perspective of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald , and her daughters.
It needs a very very experienced actor , or a young and immense talented Impersonator - such as Helena Bonham Carter , to give us Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. Helena Bonham Carter shows clearly , what an attentive Specatator could sense before - that she always was more than just a pretty young lady , and best corset queen in the victorian age. Her ongoing ambitions of playing complicated caracters is proofed here to be absolutely coorect. And of course one should never forget , that neither mrs. Owald nor her Daughters woudl have choosen to get involved into public attention in that way. Great Story,  great casting and again a necessary view on this tragic happening,  .",1389484800,,932,4.636363636363637
8618617,1,B00FUABGV2,"This was a terrible movie. I was in it so I should know. I played the part of the Dallas police car driver at the funeral scene.
However, it was cut from the script. I remember driving slowly because it was supposed to be a funeral. Then the director
told me, ""Drive faster. We can slow it down if we need to.""
The had a look alike for Oswald's mother but never put her on camera either. Worse than that it took two years to finish.
In the words of one of the other actor...""It is a bad production.""
Save your time and watch a good documentary about the assassination instead.
By the way, the funeral scene was filmed at Rose Hill Cemetery in Fort Worth where Oswald is actually buried.",1386460800,,686,4.244274809160306
