7981784,5,B00008DDIN,"The whole series is quite excellent in it's storytelling and character development. A little slow for many veiwers, but Its about as intelligent as anime gets these days. Some people say the translation is horrible, but I just watch it in Japanese anyway?",1094169600,,255,4.953488372093023
7981785,5,B00008DDIN,"Having been a huge fan of Crest of the Stars and the fantastic character developement, I of course wanted to buy the next installments in the series!  And I was not disappointed.  Some may say the translation is bad, but I think overall the way the characters interact and the fascinating Abhs completely make up for it.  I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!",1073520000,,343,4.590163934426229
7981786,5,B00008DDIN,"While the translation may have had its share of errors, the series in itself is as close to a perfect piece of storytelling as I've seen to date.  None of the characters fall into the ""anime stereotypes"" that are so common in series released in the last 5 or 6 years.  You'll find no squealy girls dressed in maid outfits trying to win the affection of the male lead character.
What they do have, is a solid progression of the story from start to finish, with characters who have believable personalities and do believable things.  And the author's light-hearted sense of humor translates well into the dialogue.
The translation errors are not really serious (I didn't notice until another reviewer pointed them out) will only annoy you if you happen to know japanese and you happen to care.  But if you know japanese, it's better just to turn off the subtitles anyway, isn't it?
If you're a sci-fi anime fan looking for a good story to add to the collection, this is it.  Crest of the Stars, this series's predecessor, is coming out in june in a boxed set; you should consider getting that as well, to find out how Jinto and Lafiel met and how they survived their first adventure together.",1053734400,5,1190,4.59433962264151
