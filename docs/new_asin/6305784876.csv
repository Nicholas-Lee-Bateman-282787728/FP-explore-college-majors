1077072,5,6305784876,"There are very few movies dealing with extremely painful issues. It seems these issues are at times hidden in doctor's offices and schools and unless you have a relative or friend with this disorder it might remain a mystery to you.

Since recent studies are suggesting that as many as 1 in 150 children age 10 or younger may be affected by autism or a related disorder, this film is relevant and brings awareness to the disorder.

Some say it is a result of giving babies their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot and doctors claim it is primarily a genetic disorder. Many parents say the shot caused their child to throw tantrums, lose language skills and tune out. The theory is that some autism stems from a severe immune reaction to the vaccine.

There are many treatments which can make a difference in the life of an autistic person. Speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, medication and special diets are of benefit.

I first found out about autism while working for a family in the Seattle, WA area and I was amazed at the sheer patience the parents exhibited. If you think your life is at all difficult, spend one day with an autistic child. It takes a great amount of patience, love and commitment.

Not only is life difficult for the caretakers, daily life is also difficult for autistic people. ""Molly"" shows both sides of the story.

Elisabeth Shue plays Molly and completely captures the extremely short attention spans, indifference to those around her, tantrums and screaming, obsessive interests, preoccupations with various objects, love for identical routines, acute hearing and love of saying ""no"" to every question.

Her 32-year-old brother Buck (Aaron Eckhart) suddenly becomes responsible for her when the home she is staying in closes. She turns his world upside down and when he loses his job, he finds other work he can do at home so they can survive.

When they discover a way Molly may be significantly helped, she undergoes a brain operation. There is a constant threat that the person who has emerged from Molly's body will again sink into the depths of autism. She starts to make everyone aware of what an autistic person goes through and can express herself in an intelligent manner. In fact people with autism can be extremely intelligent. They are really just locked inside a body which will not let them interact with others in a way society expects.

Molly has moments which are so delightfully funny because in any other situation besides a movie, they would probably be embarrassing to a person caring for the person. Molly has a child-like joy and one of the best moments in the movie is when she runs through a water fountain with pure joy and fascination. She can be rather mischievous at times. There are also some rather surreal moments you just have to accept for what they are.

She even considers marriage and reaches a level of independence which was impossible before the operation.

Throughout the movie, they promote an awareness that we are all valuable human beings no matter what our disorders and that love and patience is sorely needed in our society. Instead of accepting societies tendency to hide individuals with mental conditions, they encourage us to learn more about mental illness and to treat these individuals with the respect all human beings deserve.

This is a beautiful story of how a brother takes on the responsibility of looking after his sister and goes beyond the call of duty to make her life peaceful and comforting.

Get out the tissues! Throughout the movie, the beauty of the innocence of a child can at times be a bit overwhelming. Especially if you know someone who has this condition.

You will cry, laugh and cry some more. I found this to be a roller coaster of emotions and while the ending is not what you expect, it is a mingling of beauty and sadness.

1077073,5,6305784876,"Molly is a great movie. The more times I watch it, the better it gets. This is a movie which deals with a disabled person (Shue), and ,as a disabled survivor myself (traumatic brain injury from an auto accident), I can fully attest to the fact that so many of the points dealt with in this movie are 100% accurate. I know this only a movie, but I always get so emotional watching this video (and I hardly ever get emotional otherwise). So, to sum up, this is a fabulous movie that needs to be viewed, if at all possible!",1044316800,7,520,4.21
1077074,2,6305784876,"But it isn't as bad as I'd anticipated.  I'm a long time John Duigan fan, so I had to see it.  And yes, this is a career low for him.  But one of the major problems with this dvd is that it is using the studio cut of the movie, which removes about 20 minutes from the film.  Is the movie any better with those 20 extra minutes?  I don't know, but it does explain how some characters seem to just float through the movie.  Their roles may have been reduced in the editing process.  The movie is also just plain weird or goofy in certain sections (Molly's reaction when she sees the bodybuilders or when she wets her pants).
Duigan is truly a gifted director: see Flirting, The Year My Voice Broke, or Sirens before judging his work or his capability. I just hope to heaven that he returns to writing his own films, as well as directing.",984441600,2,835,4.213836477987422
1077075,4,6305784876,"This movie repeats the themes that were much better dealt with in Awakenings and Rain Man. Nevertheless, the performances of Elisabeth Shue and Aaron Eckhart are very moving and worth seing. Thus, the film, although certainly not a masterpiece, is, in my opinion, among the best movies recently released on video.",971568000,,313,5.1568627450980395
1077076,3,6305784876,"This is a story of an autistic woman who goes to live with her self-centered brother after the institution she has been living in for most of her life is shut down.  Her brother has no idea on how to take care of  her - tries to enroll her in regular daycare?  I mean, c'mon...Who would do  that?
It turns out that she is a great candidate for an experimental  surgery that could & eventually does make her normal.  This movie  explores her trials and tribulations growing up in such a short period of  time.  She asks her brother to marry her.  She has alot of fun at a  baseball game.
This is an enjoyable movie with an uplifting ending.  A  little sad - but you will get over it.",960336000,4,682,4.153846153846154
1077077,4,6305784876,"This is a touching, bittersweet and wonderful film about an autistic woman who gains full use of her cognitive reasoning through an experimental procedure.  Molly (Elisabeth Shue) is a 28 year old autistic who has been  institutionalized much of her life.  When the institution closes, she is  left in the care of her self absorbed brother Buck (Aaron Eckhart).  She is  recommended for a new experimental procedure which transforms her into a  normal young woman.  As the story unfolds we see her grow from a child into  a woman with many sweet and funny moments resulting from Molly's view of  the world through childlike eyes.  As her relationship with her brother  grows, his transformation is as dramatic as hers.
The film was charmingly  done with a coming of age quality about it.  There were numerous comical  and heart warming moments resulting from Molly's misperception of a world  she is trying to make sense of.
The only thing working against this film  is the fact that this ground has been retraced in so many ways that it  suffers from the tendency to compare it to other films.  It has elements of  `Flowers for Algernon', `Rainman', `At First Sight' and `Awakenings'.  It  is difficult for a film to be fully appreciated when the viewer is mentally  comparing it to all these other stories.  That is a pity in this case  because this really is a lovable story in its own right.
Elisabeth Shue  gives us marvelous performance as Molly.  Her portrayal of autism is  realistic and endearing.  She is so childlike that you really sense that  she has the mind of a 3 year old.  Later, as she transitions to the mind of  an adult, she retains that childlike naivet&eacute; that gives the character a  purity and wisdom that is fresh and free from cynicism.  It was a wonderful  performance that regrettably will not be seen by many since this film lives  in obscurity as a single facing on the rental shelves.
I rated Molly an  8/10.  On an emotional level, I really enjoyed it more than that, but I  felt compelled to subtract a couple of points for lack of originality.  However, if you enjoy human interest stories this one will certainly touch  your heart.",957657600,25,2172,4.7005347593582885
1077078,1,6305784876,"Earning a comparison to any of Ed Wood's camp classics, this film attempts to pass off Elisabeth Shue as a ""Rain Man""-like woman who undergoes a ""Charly""-like operation and in the end, loses her gifts in an ""Awakenings""-like reversal. In other words, nothing  of originality occurs. The acting is beyond inept (Shue should turn in her  SAG card immediately), the direction bizarre (does anyone look like they  know what they are doing?), and the script loaded with cheap sentimentality  and forced ""humor."" The film never really decides on what it  should be: Is it a serious drama? A cutesy comedy? Who knows? As always in  films of this type, the mentally challenged individual is imbued with the  wisdom of the gods, instructing us all on our collective failures and our  need to appreciate life's beauty. Further, this film seems to believe that  if we were only willing to comb the various institutions of the world we  would find people able to change our planet with insightful commentary and  brilliant philosophical theories. That silliness aside, the film remains a  shocking waste because it makes no effort to establish living, breathing  characters, nor does it care whether we understand the story from scene to  scene. But let's get back to Shue.....oh my poor Shue. When she's not  reminding the audience that she is acting with a capital A (she seems to be  saying, ""Look Academy, I can really act!""), she poors on the  pathos like it was going out of style. To purchase this DVD would be to  prove that one clearly has a driving biological need to waste money in the  worst way possible.",956966400,15,1605,4.813186813186813
1077079,3,6305784876,"A great performance by Shue does not overshadow the fact that we have seen this story before. Flowers for Algernon and Charly were the original stories from the 60's.

1077168,4,6305784876,"My wife and I watched this film due to our interest in the subject matter.  We have two children on the autism spectrum, one of whom is somewhat severely affected, and were curious to see what sort of portrayal this film would make.  To be honest, much of the depiction of Elizabeth Shue's character in this film is spot-on, if our experience is any indication.  In this film, she strips in public because she feels too warm, lines up objects, and even takes comfort in holding a piece of string - all exactly like our son.  Though Shue's performance was quite strong, I didn't feel that the other characters were portrayed with very much color or development.  And, though the plot line wasn't weak, per se, it wasn't exceptionally strong either.  It felt a bit like they were reworking the main theme of the 1991 film ""Awakenings"" without giving the plot much in terms of original twists, direction, or development of a more deep and nuanced message.  I give it four stars on the strength of Shue's performance and the movie's depiction of the signs of autism.",1390694400,2,1062,4.647058823529412

1077206,5,6305784876,"We have a sister who is like this all her life. She is almost 60 now and has a house with newspapers in bags in piles 6 feet high in the entire place. Thousands of them. She has the mind of a 10 year old. IF you take any of the papers away and try to get rid of them she comes unglued. It's a fetish. She collects the obituaries of people that die that she knew during her life when she finds them, and then cuts the paper into shredded paper for packing boxes BY HAND. And there's hundreds of bags filled with the shredded paper with the paper all placed in the bag laying in the same direction! It's crazy if you don't know this condition. The reviewers who poo poo this move ARE CLUELESS to someone with special needs. They just criticize for the sake of it - that's their calling - to be critical of something that passes by them.

Take this woman and bring her to horses and she is like a little girl again. This is considered to be Asperger syndrome. A genetic autism that has different levels. ""People with Asperger syndrome often display intense interests.."" Wikipedia shows if you look it up. She is obsessed with genealogy and country music. Ask her about any song and she knows who it is and when it was made, and all about the singer and their life, from reading the magazines on it. She knows every kind of horse, and can keep stables and will hug the horses and talk to them. They are very receptive to her. IT's sad.

1077209,4,6305784876,"Long ago Elisabeth Shue proved she wasn't just another blond with a pretty face. In Molly, she proves that she is a wonderful actress and one that could give so-called A-list movie stars a run for their money.

Molly (Shue) is a bright, energetic young woman with autism. When the institution she's been staying in shuts down, she is left in the care of her brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart). This doesn't stand well with Buck who already has a busy life as a bachelor and ad executive. He isn't too thrilled with taking his sister in but comes through and allows Molly to stay with him. Immediately Molly intrudes on Buck's life with her odd behavior. He finds himself stressed out by work and with Molly around it's impossible to get any peace. After going through several trying moments with his sister he hears of a new study and signs Molly up to be a participant.

From there the movie turns into fantasy. Molly partakes in brain scans and lessons until she goes through an amazing transformation. Little by little Molly loses her autism and becomes so smart she ends up a genius. With her new mind Molly sets off to have a life of her own. She goes through the normal stages of emotion we all go through. She falls in love, gets jealous, and even copes with the fact that Buck never wanted her around when they were younger. Molly even begins seeing the young doctor Sam who befriended her when she had autism. Soon Molly is brightening up the lives of everyone around her and she proves to Buck that things are not always as they seem.

Molly is a lovely comedy for the entire family. It properly displays the serious of autism while bringing out Molly's comedic side. You can't help but grin a bit when she makes her child like noises or when she repeats what Buck says. Shue and Ackhart had wonderful chemistry and you could truly believe they were brother and sister. Ackhart plays Buck low-key. We know he cares for Molly or else he wouldn't put up with her, but Buck also has to cope with guilt for how he treated Molly all her life. Confronting these emotions brings them closer together.

The supporting cast was interesting but you rarely pay them attention because Shue steals the show. I was extremely impressed with her performance and feel that if this film had been a major release she could've garnered an Oscar winning performance.

The film is not without its issues. The plot borderlines on silly at times. I would've liked to see more of Molly and Sam. It was hilarious when the new Molly set off to seduce Sam but it was cut short. We were led to believe that we'd see Molly in a romance but it never took off. I think that would've been a very strong point to explore. The idea was thrown out there but nothing came of it. I would've liked to see more Sam and Molly instead of the wasted scenes with the doctors in the institution.

The worst part of the movie was the ending. It was a complete disappointment to have Molly go right back to her previous state. That's right. Her genius runs out and she reverts back to having autism. This was a huge curve ball that changed my opinion of the movie. I wanted a happy ending because I felt Molly deserved that and I also felt cheated because of how the film was set up. I didn't see the point of having Molly go through this transformation for everything to just go back to the way it was. Maybe it was so Buck could truly see her as a person but the ending didn't work for me.

I would've given five stars if not for the ending. I recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of few films that can make you laugh, think, fall in love and cry all at the same time. They don't make jewels like this anymore.",1310169600,,3674,4.3861967694566815
1077210,5,6305784876,I found Molly a wonderful and inspiring movie about a woman with autism. I am glad that it is still available and would heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to understand some of complexities of autism.,1283385600,,207,4.621621621621622
1077211,4,6305784876,"With the 2010 release of the surprisingly entertaining ""Piranha 3D"", audiences have started taking notice of it's star, Elisabeth Shue, again, and if your knowledge of her work consists of ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"", I highly recommend her performance in ""Molly"". This 1999 'sleeper' was largely ignored when released (as it is, admittedly, cut from the same cloth as the 1968 Cliff Robertson 'Oscar'-winner, ""Charly"", and 1990's ""Awakenings"", which showcased Robert De Niro in a similar role). What sets this film apart, however, is Shue's often radiant portrait of a sensitive soul entombed in an autistic 'shell', and Aaron Eckhart's equally effective portrayal as her loving, if frustrated older brother. The pair play off each other extremely well, particularly after an experimental surgery gradually, if only temporarily, lifts her mind out of the fog. As she rushes to absorb 25 lost years of growth (including an understandable confusion over her new-found sexuality), he discovers the sister he never had a chance to know as more than a child. While the inevitable reversal is tragic, the message is positive, and life-affirming, for both of them, and the audience, as well.

A major plus for ""Molly"" is it's terrific supporting cast, particularly Thomas Jane, as Molly's best friend, a slightly mentally-impaired trustee at the mental care center (am I the only one who thinks Jane and Eckhart look like they could be brothers?), and beautiful Jill Hennessy, as the sympathetic doctor who suggests experimental surgery. In a small but showy role, early in the picture, Lucy Liu, just a year away from ""Charlie's Angels"" stardom, has a cute scene as Eckhart's assistant, dealing with a clothing-challenged Molly.

Is this a 'great' film? No, it has pretty obvious flaws and more than it's share of cliches. But it IS very good, and certainly worth watching, if you enjoy Elisabeth Shue and a fine ensemble of actors...and the price simply can't be beat!

  Elizabeth Shue (""The Saint"" and ""Cocktail"") stars as Molly McKay, a beautiful, young woman with autism.  Her learning comprehension seems to be that of a five year old.  When her care facility closes, Molly is forced to live with her workaholic brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""No Reservations""), who has only visited her at Christmas.  He has always been ashamed of her.

  Revolutionary brain surgery gives Molly a chance at living a normal life.  After the operation, she begins learning rapidly until she begins speaking and acting like a normal person.  Unfortunately, like the potion in a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde film, the procedure begins reversing itself.  Molly is heartbroken.  She is fearful of losing the strong bonds she has developed between her friend Sam (Thomas Jane of ""The Mist"" and ""The Punisher"") and her brother Buck.

  Elizabeth Shue delivers a believable performance as an autistic person.  We watch her transform from an unpredictable, out-of-control child to an emotionally stable, mature adult.  Unfortunately, we experience her pain as we watch her reverse back to her original state.  The other cast members deliver great performances as well.

  ""Molly"" is a must see for fans of romantic comedies.  A gorgeous cast, beautiful sets, a touching storyline, and a great musical score all combine to give us an enchanting experience.  You won't want to miss Molly McKay.  You'll want to embrace her, hold her close to your heart, and never let her go.  I am so glad I found this film.",1221350400,4,1780,4.862876254180602

but, one night at about 2am, while channel-surfing the UHF band I
stumbled onto an episode of ""The Goldbergs"".

The contrast between this show and today's dreck literally brought
tears to my eyes. In this particular episode, a couple who were friends
of the Goldbergs had just separated. It seems that they did not
'communicate' openly and honestly with each other during their
marriage.

In discussing this, the Goldbergs started to become increasingly candid with each other about mutual disappointments from the past. as they did so, the emotional air became more and more acrid.

The point was that there is no easy answer to the question of how much
to 'confront' and how much to sweep under the carpet. but, there was no
hitting below the belt, no potty humor, no double (or mono) entendres.
Just two decent people discussing a universal domestic problem with a
leavening of humor.

1077275,4,6305784876,"Elizabeth Shue stars as and in ""Molly"", a rather unique film about autism.

Buck has a sister that he rarely visits. She's autistic, and has been looked after by an institution ever since her parents died. Well, Buck has to visit her when this institution closes down, more than that, he'll have to look after her from now on. Initially, Buck finds her and her habits to be frustrating and embarassing, but he soon warms to her. Soon after, he finds out about a brand new operation, one that could and does change Molly's life forever. It's an operation that alters Molly's mind, so that she can communicate and learn more or less just like other people. Will it change her life? Will it change how people think of her? Will it last?

It's a bit like how science-fiction used to be. Rather than all space, time travel and parallel universes, it asks a ""what if?"". What if science could ""cure"" autism? How would the patient act? How would they feel about their new way of life? How would they learn? How would their relationships change? What would they tell you about their experiences? It's these concepts and questions the film explores, and I found it interesting. I quite liked how Elizabeth Shue played Molly as well. I thought the change after the surgery was a little sudden, perhaps, but apart from that, I thought it was pretty engaging.

Worth a look. Funny, touching, and fascinating, I thought.",1156636800,2,1406,4.661290322580645
1077276,5,6305784876,"Elisabeth Shue gives a fantastic performance in this film!

It is a touching film about autism and it's effects on members of the family!!

This movie has humor in it, as well as keeping a serious tone about it!!

I truly enjoyed the performances from all involved in this film!! See it at all cost!!",1153094400,4,300,4.418181818181818
1077277,1,6305784876,"This piece of nonsense is so badly scripted, directed and acted, that its misportrayal of autism and its phony-baloney ""cure"" (the operation doesn't just change her into a neurotypical, it makes her a genius?!) are liable to be ridiculed rather than taken seriously. You'd do better to go back and watch ""Charly"", from which the premise of this film was lifted, rather than waste 90 minutes of your life on this mess.

Dismissing it as a farce, though, creates its own difficulties. There are people right now raising huge amounts of money hoping to invent and sell a cure for autism. In fact, they've already claimed to have developed some allegedly medical treatments that ""reverse"" autism. They're selling parents a bill of goods, and doing irreparable damage (and death, in some cases) to autistic children with their so-called therapies.

Do a google search on ""autism a way of life"", ""autism diva"" or ""ballastexistenz"" and read their blogs, if you want to learn more. For a realistic look at autism, try Stillman's ""Demystifying the Autistic Experience"", Miller's ""Women from Another Planet"" or Collins' ""Not Even Wrong.""",1151798400,6,1127,5.0864864864864865
1077278,3,6305784876,"I have a family member with autism.  We see more and more of these people in film because sadly their numbers are increasing.  I found Elizabeth Shue's performance fairly convincing although I must note there is a hollywood or fairy tale quality to the film.  However I found the growing understanding of Molly about her own life, her own world and the world which her brother, Buck and other normal and typical folks inhabit thought provoking and real.  I liked how the director depicted Molly's problems with sensory intergration issues trying to show the audience how difficult it is for folks with autism to function in the world and filter out the noise.  I would have liked to have seen more time spent on how her brother dealt with his sister's disability prior to her surgury and after her retreat back from the normal typical world",1101772800,13,840,4.726027397260274
1077279,4,6305784876,"My wife and I recently rented this movie on DVD and we both liked it very much.  I've read many negative reviews of this movie and I sorely disagree as I do with many professional reviewers of many other movies.  To me a movies does not have to be perfect in every detail to be entertaining and informative, as Molly was.  Many reviewers are locked up in their own elitist ivory towers and think they can recommend, or not, movies for the rest of us.  Having been a counselor in the past and knowing several autistic persons, I believe Elizabeth Shue did an incredible job in portraying Molly.  Aaron Eckhart,  Thomas Jane, and Jill Henessy all did credible performances in support. This text refers to the DVD edition.",1092960000,14,719,4.578125

Molly is a hilarious yet very truthful film and the cast are great actors who obviously worked well together. Definitely a good film. Enjoy,1503964800,,281,4.529411764705882

They both stopped in the same place, Chapter 16, scene where they are watching a play, and nothing played past that point.  The third time was the charm, this disc works perfectly.  My family loves this movie and I'm so happy that Amazon was able to ship me a non-defective disc.  Never had a problem in having Amazon ship me a new disc or providing me information to return the defective discs. Thanks for the excellent customer service!!",1476230400,,509,4.571428571428571

This means these are DVD-R discs and EVERY COPY out of three copies I've had sent to me has been defective. The movie freezes at 59:42 on EVERY COPY! Why don't they just make it rentable?!?! As if that wasn't bad enough, I'm very upset with the so-called expert Amazon reviewer. He thought so little of the acting in this, it's clear to me this person has no clue what good acting is. Elizabeth Shue never even got a nomination for this amazing performance of a very challenging role, but did for Leaving Las Vegas. In Molly she's kind of a female version of DeNiro in Awakenings which was even more amazing being mostly true story with a much better script. I think the Amazon reviewer should have that hole in head drilling experiment done to him since his review was insulting and as pompous as Siskle & Eibert reviews used to be.",1466812800,,904,4.419161676646707
