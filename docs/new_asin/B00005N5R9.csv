7946095,5,B00005N5R9,"this is one of my favorite movies. It was made for tv and has 3 episodes.battle of the broomsticks shows Mildred's first day of school when she has her first run in with Ethel and miss Hardbroom. When we feast at the midnight hour is my favorite and I think the funniest one on this dvd,which includes her having a fishy little problem. A pig in a poke is barnyard fun when Ethel gets hers by being turned into a pig. This was made for younger viewers and while it has a theme that is similar to Harry Potter, it is more pleasant and suitable for younger children maybe 8 or 9 years old. There is no foul language and no sexual suggestion, just good clean fun. My son and I are quite fond of it i'm 44 and he's 25 yrs.old so kids of all ages even if they're just young at heart can appreciate this one",1149292800,,801,4.075949367088608
7946096,5,B00005N5R9,"BATTLE OF THE BROOMSTICKS
Poor Mildred Hubble makes a mess of her first day at Witch Academy. First, on her way to school, she runs afoul of snobby Ethel Hallow who'll become her arch enemy. Then she arrives late and the gate is closed on her. She clumsily flies over it and crash lands into a dust bin on the other side, narrow missing a collision with Miss Hardbroom, the strict no-nosense witch who'll be Mildred's home room teacher.
Luckily Mildred makes fast friends with the sweet, soft spoken Maud Moonshine. Who patches Mildred's now broken broom with packing tape. Having a bent broom won't help with the broomstick flying test, which the girls will have to pass in order to stay on at the academy. And Mildred's both afraid of heights and the dark, which will make the test difficult. But, she has the the help of her new friends, Maud, Ruby Cherrytree and Jadu Wali, and she'll need it.
WHEN WE FEAST AT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR.
Mildred and her friends plan a midnight raid on the kitchen, prompted by the disgusting school menu. Which is no fault of Miss Tapioca, the cook. She has to follow the school book of regulations on what to serve. And it always gets cold, on the long journey to the dining room.
Because of the complaints, Miss Cackle decides to eat the same food as the students. And discovers just how gross it is.
The girls' midnight feast is scheduled for the last night of Sir Walter's Wet Week, a time when a ghost is supposed to wander the corridors of the spooky old castle.
PIG IN A POKE
Mr. Blossom's nephew Charlie comes for a visit, and Ethel is being particulary snotty to Mildred. Especially after the cat presentation ceremony & Mildred is given cute tabby kitten, instead of the traditional black one, because they ran out. Ethel can't resist teasing. Mildred is pushed too far, and turns Ethel into a pig by accident (she was trying for a frog...)
Then Ethel trots off, getting lost, and Mr. Blossom takes her to a local pig farmer, who is taking his pigs to market that day!
Charlie takes an active part in the rescue, he knows a reversing spell, kind of..
Based on the books by Jill Murphy and presented in the U.S. on HBO. This is an incredible series. Heart warming, wholesome, and witty. I don't think it's for an specific age group, people of all ages will enjoy it. The scripts are very well written, very humorous. And the cast is excellent. They all seem to enjoy their roles very much. Georgina Sherrington will charm you, she's the perfect match for Mildred Hubble.
And that spooky castle is really cool. I wish there was a school like that. :-)
And I wish and hope that BFS video and Granada will put more episodes on vhs and dvd. There are more than what's in the two collections, including one of my favorites ""It's a Frog's Life"".",1064707200,4,2778,4.5029702970297025
