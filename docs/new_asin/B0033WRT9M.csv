Uses a 1080i/50 encoding that is not supported by most.  This should not be marketed towards Americans.",1288137600,30,242,4.5813953488372094

4065659,5,B0033WRT9M,I love this show and really love the South America adventure that is on this disc set. Cinematography is amazing as are the 3 presenters. I love this!,1280966400,2,150,4.392857142857143

8388099,3,B0033WRT9M,"---I got mine for Christmas---

While I love this show, and Especially this particular Episode, this review will be more about the Quality of the Product. Not about the Show itself.

So here's the deal, The Video Quality is only 10% better than the TV version, that Aired on BBC America.
So as far as a Video-Quality difference: Not worth buying the Blu-Ray over the DVD version.

That being said, what DOES make the Blu-Ray worth buying at all, is the fact that you have All of these tiny clips (deleted scenes) that you never saw in the TV version, that are mixed into all of the other scenes you already know and love.

The only thing I really Hate about this Blu-Ray, is the fact that all Cussing, is Still Censored. Just like the TV Version.
*BLEEP *BLEEP *BLEEP  It gets very annoying, knowing you should've been given an uncensored version.
If I wanted BLEEPS, i'd watch the Damn TV Version. Censorship kills the Point of the Blu-Ray.
At the Very Least; give me a selectable audio track, so I can CHOOSE, Censored, or Un ! ! !
Sid Note: There are 2 Audio Tracks, the 2nd one is the Actor commentary, I guess you could call it.
The Top Gear Guys talking about things that were happening and such....

Now, you Do get 2 separate Discs. Mine arrived with the Car episode out of its holder, and flopping around the package, getting dinged up.
Which is fine, because I only wanted the 4WD Bolivia Episode anyway.
Runtime for this episode is about 1hr 5mins, on this Disc.

The Video 'IS' a Full 1920x1080p. Not black bars on the Top & Bottom of the Screen.
See the Included Screenshots.

Hope that Helps.",1482969600,,1606,4.4573378839590445

regading the player.
blu-ray players are cheaper now then it is back then when it costed a 1,000.00 when it first started on the market.
Now its under 100.00 back then the 1,000.00 machines was better parts then today cheap parts now being used.

The Great Adventure 3/ South America .The directors cut. be warned if you got the fear of giant ugly bugs. and thick heavy jungle. big huge giant bugs with 8 legs and a big butt with hair on it. OH man AAAAAAHHHHh!
that episode may not be for you. however it will get better once they leave the jungle. still with the fear of realy gib giant bugs Gosh I hate bugs! I understand Richard Hammond's fear of bugs. still it was well watching it to see how it ended",1327104000,,932,4.177777777777778
8388101,5,B0033WRT9M,"Purchased this Blu-ray from a dealer on Amazon, without having read the comments (my bad, sorry). I LOVE 'Top Gear'.  Love watching Jeremy, James, and Richard. So, when I found out that the disc wouldn't play on my player, I was pretty upset--especially since my Polar expedition disc, and series 14 and 15 discs played without a hitch on my PS3.  Thankfully, someone had posted (in the comments section) a link to a list of Blu-ray players that would play discs that had been programmed to play only on PAL systems.  However, I couldn't find a player where I live, that was on the list, and at an affordable price.  Happily, I estimated from the list and purchased a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-BD630-Network-Blu-ray-Disc-Player/dp/B004MSI7UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG BD630 Network Blu-ray Disc Player</a>&nbsp;that I found in a store here and IT WORKED!  I am also happy to report that 'Top Gear-Great Adventures 3 [Blu-ray]' was so worth the money, aggrevation, and stress!!!  If you are a fan, and enjoyed watching the episodes that aired on the TV, you are going to love the Director's Cut and extras!",1308182400,4,1161,5.386740331491713
8388102,1,B0033WRT9M,"Watch out! (1) TopGear: The Great Adventures 3, (2) TopGear: Apocalypse and (3) Clarkson: The Italian Job Blu-rays DO NOT PLAY on my new state of the art Samsung players. Both of my NEW Samsung Blu-ray players are up to date but they complain about changing the resolution of my NEW Samsung TV. It is interesting to note that TopGear 14 and TopGear 15 play stunningly!!! I will be sending them back for exchange or refund. I would prefer an exchange as I ""love"" TopGear UK"".",1298246400,10,474,4.523255813953488
8388103,5,B0033WRT9M,"What a great DVD!  I have an LG BD590 and it plays this disc fine.  The images are stunning and the stories include extra footage that make them seem more like small movies, much better than watching them on Top Gear as part of their regular broadcast.

The commentary on the South American adventure was a bit odd though.  James May was one of the commentators, but he didn't seem to have enough input, and one of the voices (I think it was Andy Wilman, the producer) seemed to genuinely dislike the presenters, Hammond in particular.  Perhaps it was all in fun, but it sounded a discordant note in the commentary for me.  Lots of talk about camera work, but I'd have preferred to hear more about the locations and on-the-road annecdotes.",1297036800,,739,4.5606060606060606
8388104,5,B0033WRT9M,"Did not work in a newer Toshiba Blu Ray.  Got the Blu Ray to work in an old Samsung BD-P1500, and it is great... The South American adventure is the best they've done so far, and they threw in a commentary by James May, as well as Bonneville and Romania.  Necessary addition to a Top Gear collection, and nearly worth finding a compatible Blu Ray player.",1295568000,3,354,4.348484848484849
8388105,1,B0033WRT9M,"Do not buy  this set - it won't play on many Blu-Ray players.  I do not understand why they even sell such a set - I will not buy any further Top Gear discs.

8388106,1,B0033WRT9M,I purchased this first from Bluflick and i thought it was the disc. They told me to update my firmware on my Blu-Ray player but even after that it still didn't work! So i sent it back to them and ended up buying it from another seller Once again it did not work in my PS3. So i ended up buying a NEW Blu-Ray Player and not just any Blu-Ray  player i bought the Denon DBP-2010ci! and guess what still did not work. Found out it was really made for European  player it plays at 1080i/@50hz that only a few player support not sure if any american player will even play it! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,1291161600,17,588,4.104347826086957
8388107,4,B0033WRT9M,Got the Blu Ray and it wouldn't play in my sony players.  Company never mentioned their BBC blurays had problems playing on sony and panasonic players when ordering on the web site but when received order there was a note packed in with the product stating such.  They offered a full refund no questions asked but they should have been up front and listed this on the web site instead of after the product is ordered.  Their solution was to buy a new blu ray player...LOL or return it.  It's not worth my time returning a 20.00 blu ray so i guess they win.  Will have to give it to someone or wait until I decided to get another blu ray.,1290902400,2,637,4.231404958677686
