4698836,3,B005GYXO8K,"Only bought this DVD set becauase it contained the 'Hunter' movie. The movie was ok, not the usual standard from Fred Dryer and the 'Hunter' team. Could have been much better, if it had Stephanie Kramer.",1322006400,8,203,4.666666666666667

8472490,4,B005GYXO8K,I Enjoyed It Very Much But I Also Picked Up The Greatest American Hero Complete Set & It Included The Greatest American Heroine So It Was Useless Purchase But That Is On Me Not The Seller. Everything On Sellers Side Was Great.,1410912000,,226,4.404761904761905

8472492,5,B005GYXO8K,"These are all good shows and as you can see from other reviews most people bought this to see one show.

True of me too.  This was the only set I could find with the Greatest American Heroine on it.  And I really wanted to see that.

Then I am thinking well I liked Hunter lets watch that.  Really good show but not why I bought the disc.  Lassiter and Pretender were about the same.  Good shows no skips or anything and good sound.

To sum up, they are all good shows.  They are not stand alone movies.  They may be feature length but they are made for viewers who are familiar with the established characters.  If you have not seen these shows then don't waste your money.

This has been compiled for those who are nostalgic about these shows and if you are familiar with these shows then this is really enjoyable.",1393977600,2,816,4.261437908496732
8472493,5,B005GYXO8K,"I remember ""The Greatest American Hero"" as one of the best TV series of the eighties . Very creative, it influenced even the superhero comics and graphic novels . I bought the entire series, and also ""The Greatest American Heroine"", that was the series finale , because I wanted to show my grandson something  that  is not full of violence and sex like the series that are on TV in these days. It may seem naive, but he watched some episodes on the web and loved it, laughed a lot also.
A great buy, for sure.",1375401600,3,509,4.291666666666667
8472494,3,B005GYXO8K,"I bought this primarily for the ""The Greatest American Heroine"" pilot, to complete ""The Greatest American Hero: The Complete Series"", which really should have included it as a bonus feature. The DVD picture is good, considering that the episode was shot back in '86, so don't expect HD.",1370304000,2,286,4.979166666666667
8472495,5,B005GYXO8K,Highly recommend this 4 movie set to add to you collection.  A good variety of movies in one DVD set.,1361318400,,101,4.05
8472496,3,B005GYXO8K,"The first show is the final episode of the Greatest American Hero that was to be the forerunner to a spin off.  Perhaps it was the era but the girl strays into annoying from the bubbly it seems they were aiming for and the big issue Bill and the girl took on was turning up in a bar (theres more to it but it would be a major spoiler to go into detail)and perhaps i blinked but it was a mile away from the orignal series.

The Return  of Hunter - I actually couldn't believe this was made in 1994.  It was so 70s older bloke younger woman and the blokey theme - even the actual quality of the film looked so 70s TV.  However this one was better than Jake Lassiter (pairing the subject who played sport about 20 years or more before but constantly referenced early on with his good friends daughter - like eewww just wrong for 90s tv and not to mention again very blokey innuendo).  The further this one also made around 94 or 95 went on the more it just looked like the Hunter story elements swapped around in a slightly different way.

The Great Pretender - this one had merit  though again the blokey references (such as the drunk celebrating and the working with the friend to work ideas on the mystery while the female drifted off in the background instead of being a true partner) were annoying but this show noted as 91 would have fit in with others that were picked up in the late 80s with a few changes here and there (such as changing where and how the female became involved with the company).

They could have been edited to be a lot more compact (well GAH could have been padded out more but the rest could havde been edited down to the 41 minutes without too much of a problem).  For the price its good if you want to find out how they eventually ended the Greatest American Hero as this spin off pilot was not on the most recent box set or if you are a fan of any of the lead actors in the other three movies.  I guess for the other three if you watch them as if they were from the 70s and 80s they are OK.",1360713600,,2020,4.114503816793893
8472497,3,B005GYXO8K,I got it to see Hunter it was good but it had nothing to do with Mccall it would have been better with her in it where is all that stuff with Stephanie Kramer they made it where is all that stuff I hope they bring it out soon.,1339718400,,226,3.63265306122449
8472498,5,B005GYXO8K,"I only bought this DVD becauase I wanted the Bruce Greenwood movie it contained so I haven't watched the others as of yet but if they are as good as ""The Great Pretender"", then it would be an evening of great entertainment. Even so, since all the movies are written by the late Stephen Cannell, it is still a good deal.

In 'The Great Pretender', Greenwood plays Earl Brattigan, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who wins a court case to have himself reinstated to the paper he was fired from after he nearly got his then boss nearly indicted in connection with a campaign fund story he had written. Thinking he would get back all he had lost at being fired, he finds that do to a typho his former column and all the perks he had before are gone replaced by a sub-basement office, no expense account AND his column would come from the cold cases of the paper. By doing this, the boss thinks he gets his just revenge on Earl since all the stories he has to work with are worthless until Earl comes across an obit of a man who he had done a story on four years before and whose acccidental death didn't sit right with Earl so he investigates opening up another can of worms.

It was fast paced and funny, the way Cannell's scripts always were. Bruce Greenwood plays Earl Brattigan as a slick, bad boy conman but with an endearing, dedicated to finding the truth trait that justifies his sometime shady way of getting the job done. Gregg Henry plays his friend and mentor, Wilson and the two play off each other great. I have yet to see a movie that Bruce Greenwood has been bad in, he has such a versatile acting style that he can do any type of acting and make it enjoyable.",1329523200,4,1675,4.3312101910828025
