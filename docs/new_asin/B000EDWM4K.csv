8108705,5,B000EDWM4K,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them.
 The three Michael Landon shows were near the top of my list to buy, and all three are in the top ten on the list below. But there was never any question about rating Highway to Heaven as high as the other two because it didn't last as long.
If there had never been a Highway to Heaven, its doubtful if there would have been a Touched by an Angel. The two shows were similar in theme, that the love of God is powerful enough to heal the heartbreaks of human beings.
The reason Touched by an Angel is No. 2 on the list below, and Highway to Heaven is No. 8, is not a difference in show quality, but longevity. Touched by an Angel had nine great seasons. Highway to Heaven was equally great for three seasons, but not in its last two.
Highway to Heavens outstanding feature was the chemistry between angel Jonathan Smith (Landon) and former Oakland cop Mark Gordon (Victor French). Their working relationship had begun with Little House on the Prairie.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners.",1384905600,2,1587,4.529616724738676

8108707,5,B000EDWM4K,"I've always liked Michael Landon's TV work on ""Bonanza,"" ""Little House On The Prairie,"" and ""Highway To Heaven."" One never had to be concerned about vile or profane language on any of those shows.

Michael Landon would be the last person to ever make a claim that his private conduct was beyond reproach. He had personal problems as do we all at times.

However, the quality of his directorial ability and TV performances and his starring vehicles in ""Little House"" and ""Highway To Heaven"" is second-to-none! One of my favorite ""Highway To Heaven"" episodes featured Dick Van Dyke and was aired during the third season.

I imagine we'll never see shows such as ""Little House,"" ""Highway To Heaven,"" or ""Touched By An Angel"" again. And that's a real shame. I think that Victor French and Michael worked well together on ""HTH."" From my understanding, Mr. Landon and Mr. French died within a year of each other. May you both rest in peace.",1369699200,,934,4.753086419753086
8108708,5,B000EDWM4K,Loving it and this is good old fashioned television at its best. It is inspiring and uplifting and wholesome morality. I would love my entire family to learn these lessons hopefully from me and augmented with shows like this one. Michael Landon was a genus. I would recommend this for anyone that is interested in being entertained and inspired in your heart and mind. This is a step above anything that is on TV today.,1305849600,,419,4.6
8108709,4,B000EDWM4K,"I read some other reviewers that complained about missing scenes.  While that may be true, the programming is so much better than the junk programming that's on tv now-a-days.  Even with the deleted scenes, this is still a good series.  There are some episodes that are not suitable for younger viewers, however, on the whole, it does teach heart-warming lessons about life.",1181692800,5,374,5.0
