The Pentagon Flyover Theory is fatally flawed: 1) there is no benefit to flying a plane over, instead of into, the Pentagon 2) there was an enormous risk that any flyover plane would have been recorded on citizen video, and 3) there's nowhere for the flyover plane to go without detection.  In the flyover environs were crowded freeways, an airport, a golf course, a marina, a plane-spotters' park, the Capitol Mall no-fly zone, two DoD colleges, and a naval shipyard--all of which would potentially be populated by witnesses to whom the flyover would be very conspicuous.

In the early days of the Flyover Theory, it was supposed that the plane could have landed on Runway 15 at the Reagan National Airport.  This is unlikely, and the Flyover theorists have now abandoned that scenario.  Runway 15 was short, and was not used by 757s but only by small commuter planes.  A 757 landing there would have risked running off the end of the runway into the river; it would have been very conspicuous to air traffic controllers, airport employees, frequent fliers, and pilots--and it would have been doubly conspicuous because runway 15 crosses the main runway, airport traffic that day was coming in from the south and departing to the north, and the aircraft would have been coming in wrong way for the traffic.

There is nowhere for a Flyover plane to go.  South would be against the one-way airport traffic, north would go to the no-fly zone, E would cross the normal flight path, pass right over the plane-spotters park, over a golf course, two war colleges and the naval shipyard.

There's only one place for a flyover plane to go, and that's to make a screaming 5g turn at an 80 degree bank angle (visible from the marina, the plane-spotters' park, the airport, the freeways, the golf course) toward the White House and up the river to join the departing airport traffic.

Also, there's no reason for a flyover op--except perhaps to provide employment for cottage-industry conspiracy theorists--and it never could have been approved in the first place.  Dozens or even hundreds of high-rise windows looked down on the Pentagon--offices, hotels, apartments.  The plotters had no way to control who might set up a video camera running on a tripod, just on the chance that something interesting might happen at the Pentagon.  A videotape of a flyover plane would be devastating to the government's credibility.

The whole idea of a Flyover op is absurd.  Some people cling to their illusions.",1374105600,,2625,4.891647855530474
