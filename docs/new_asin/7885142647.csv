1136325,4,7885142647,"I have read in other places around the internet about the inferiority of Seung-gi Kang's South Korean remake of the much beloved 1986 Hong Kong film ""A Better Tomorrow"", which in itself was a remake of a little known (in the U.S.) 1967 movie called Ying xiong ben se (Story of a Discharged Prisoner). I guess a movie with this much baggage  behind it is not going to get a fair shake, and how could it, not only did ""A Better Tomorrow"" launch the international careers of director John Woo and co-star Chow Yun Fat, start a franchise (sequels, knockoffs, etc.), but it started the whole heroic bloodshed movement in HK cinema, and is ranked as the second on the list of the 100 greatest Chinese Motion Pictures. In HK, and other countries, the look of Chow's character Mark led a generation into dressing in long trenchcoats called ""dusters"" and wearing ray-ban sunglasses while chewing on a toothpick, some even feared it would lead the youth to choose a life of crime and degradation. I have such a strong affinity for the film myself that I can say it is easily one of my favorite films, top 250 for sure. So how does a remake live up to all this, well it can't, but I knew that, and so should you, but based on it's own merits this a is a worthy successor.

Over the past decade or so, South Korea has been a hot bed of exciting, daring and original filmmaking, director Hae-sun Song and his team of screenwriters have tackled the subject of A Better Tomoorow and brought it into a new light just by changing the location of the story. Told from the point of view of two brothers, who were separated years earlier in a semi-failed attempt to cross from North to South Korea: Cheol has never forgiven Hyeok for abandoning him and their mother (i.e. making it across), and the consequence of their failed escape from repression. Otherwise, the story follows Woo's original quite closely, this is version may be a little less violent, though it is R-rated for ""strong bloody violence throughout."" The writing and production are top notch, the dramatics as strong as the '86 film. Woo himself felt strong enough about the movie that he and his longtime producing partner, Terence Chang, are listed in the credits as executive producers. This is a darker, more bleak film in many respects though.

The only real let down would have to be with the new cast, the three leads who I am not familiar with, having never seen them in any films prior. They are Kang-woo Kim, Jin-mo Ju and Seung-heon Song, and while they do a fine job, they lack the chemistry and charisma that Leslie Cheung, Ti Lung and Chow Yun-Fat brought to the original film, their dynamics were a big part of the success of that movie's. Otherwise, only the freshness of an original work is missing. This is a good film, and if you enjoyed the Woo classics, this is a welcome return, putting the heroics back into the bloodshed.",1337472000,6,2892,4.5576923076923075
1136326,4,7885142647,"Unlike die-hard fans, I don't recall being aware of the original film; so my reactions to this version cannot come from comparison.  The Korean 2010 version of ""A Better Tomorrow"" is powerful.  It strikes a chord as the older brother Hyuk played by Joo Jin-mo (as listed on the trailer) has deep regrets from the past and having to abandon his younger brother.  Joo Jin-mo rivets our attention on the screen.  The actor won a Best Actor Award at South Korea's Baek Sang Awards in 2009 for ""A Frozen Flower.""  His younger brother Chul played by Kim Gang-woo has a nice emotional arc, from bitterness to indifference to revenge and finally brotherly love.  The best friend Young-chun likewise has a wonderful transition from the flashy self-assured punk to a crippled used-to-be thug to a true friend.  The good looking mob guy played by Jo Han-sun has less range, but goes from trying to control things to cowardice.  The film has the grittiness of some of James Gray's American films with Joaquin Phoenix.  Because there was such focus on the characters, at times it lapsed into a testosterone-laced melodrama.  Overall, this was a moving film well worth watching.  Enjoy!",1322524800,7,1172,4.8686868686868685
1136327,5,7885142647,"Fantastic (apparently remake) movie with excellent acting, tone, and story progression.  Very similar to some of the ""gangster"" miike movies and other recent korean action movies (such as the man from nowhere).  As with most of these movies they are not wall to wall with action and have better stories than typical action movies.

The action sequences are extremely well done and memorable; actually 3 of them you will remember for a long time (deal gone wrong, revenge, and the finale).  The ending is more jaded than typical action movies so it's not for everyone but if you like American and Japanese action movies there's no real reason why you won't like these Korean action movies except for the subtitles.  There might be dubbing on the home release...",1321056000,13,760,4.90625
1136328,4,7885142647,"I've often joked that you cannot put weight in calling yourself a man unless you have seen at least one John Woo film. His early work especially was filled with epic gunfights, explosions, and just all around awe-inspiring action sequences. The only downside is that many of his older films featuring Chow Yun Fat all feel so similar that it's really difficult to distinguish one from another. The storylines are almost exactly the same and many of the same cast members are utilized in each film. It has literally been years since I've seen the original A Better Tomorrow. I was mostly hoping for an upgrade of sorts from Dragon Dynasty since their 2-disc and Blu-ray releases of classic foreign cinema are always top notch. Nevertheless, I do remember holding both the original film and sequel in high regard. I wasn't even aware a Korean remake was on the cards until I received an email informing me of the DVD and Blu-ray details. Given the amount of remakes that hit US shores at such a quickened pace, I was a bit weary of giving this film a chance. But then I began to realize how much I love Korean film and came to notice that John Woo produced the film. So A Better Tomorrow was given its proper chance and folks, maybe it's because I haven't seen the 1986 version in so long but this remake almost seems as worthy as the original film.

Before I get ahead of myself, I love John Woo's film. I want to make that point crystal clear. A Better Tomorrow features some of the most influential action sequences not only of the 1980s, but perhaps of all time. The remake takes a bit of a different route and is more story-driven. There are only a handful of action sequences, but they feel strategically placed and mean a bit more in the long run. Character development is key. The action is only there to compliment the drama. While the original theme, location, and character names may have been changed, much of the impact of what these characters are going through is still rather strong. The majority of the film is carried by the brothers Hyuk (Jin-mo Ju) and Chul (Kang-woo Kim) and their relationship or lack thereof. Hyuk abandoned Chul and his mother years ago. With their mother now dead, Chul seeks revenge and only wants to see his brother dead while Hyuk just wants Chul to be a part of his life. Hyuk is a policeman who illegally deals guns on the side. His partner Young-chun (Seung-heon Song) is more than likely the coolest guy you've ever come across while Tae Min (Han Sun Jo) is the lackey who dreams of becoming a gangster boss.

The film looks stunning. It's beautifully shot and features some amazingly vibrant colors along with some really impressive lighting. The Young-chun gun scene with the arms dealers from Thailand near the beginning of the film is where things begin to get interesting. The interrogation scene where the brothers meet for the first time after many years of separation show how powerful the performances of Jin-Mo Ju and Kang-woo Kim are going to become. But the massage parlor scene with Young-chun is where the film begins to show its first signs of John Woo influence. While the action scenes are fewer, everything seems to be riding on the final gunfight which is pretty extraordinary. The relationship between the two brothers is what drives the movie forward, but the way Young-chun tries to make himself part of that equation and the monster Tae Min becomes is what makes the film at least a little special.

The few reviews I'm seeing online of this film are saying things like it lacks the very important theme of the John Woo film and that there isn't as much action. There's also a lack of female roles, which I agree with. This version of A Better Tomorrow is good for different reasons than its predecessor. I feel like the performances were much stronger in the remake and that the story, even though it deviated quite a bit from John Woo's version, took a front seat rather than the action. The Korean remake is slower and not quite as violent. My only complaint falls onto the ending, which is way too anticlimactic.

A Better Tomorrow is not the same movie it's labeled as remaking and that's a good thing. Strong performances and fewer action sequences help pave the way for more meaningful character development and a story with a bit more of an impact. Maybe I'm biased because I love depressing films, but A Better Tomorrow is well worth giving a chance if you can settle with the fact that it's different and altered from the source material; arguably not for the better but enjoyable in a contrasting way.

Special features are pretty minimal. It says there are 27 minutes total of special features in the set, but I believe the same set of special features are on both the DVD and the Blu-ray. So it's more like 13 minutes of the same features on both discs. There's a three minute Character Intro Cast Interview that introduces the characters and shows you a little bit behind the scenes, a four minute Making of featurette that goes into more detail behind the scenes and gives you more information about the film including it being filmed in Thailand, the type of blood packs they used, and action scenes being shot from a helicopter. Challenges & Transformations is nothing more than a two minute interviews with director Song Hae-sung and producer John Woo (separately). Throw in the original trailer and a bonus trailer and that sums up all the bonus material. Keep in mind both the DVD and Blu-ray of the film are included in one package.

A Better Tomorrow is presented in widescreen with a 16:9 aspect ratio and features stereo 5.1 HD Surround Sound along with Korean DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The film is in Korean with English subtitles and is approximately 123 minutes long. The A Better Tomorrow DVD/Blu-ray combo package is available in retail stores and most online retailers now.",1320883200,16,5872,4.668599033816425
1136329,5,7885142647,"I went in not expecting to much from it, and didn't care to much for the characters. However by the time I reached the end of the film I then realized how much I cared for characters, and how much I actually loved the film. They kept all the memorable moments of the original, which put a smile on my face. Another thing that put a smile on my face was the original theme melody that was found in certain parts of the film. The ending was a tad different from the original, and was honestly quite pleased with it. Fans of the original might find it hard to get into at first, but by the end you'll find your self pleasantly surprised. Coming from a fan of the original, you won't be disappointed.",1314748800,17,696,4.201492537313433

There will always be purists who will hate any attempted remake or quasi remake such as this one. But I thought this was a solid effort that didn't slavishly imitate the original. Judged on its own merits, this was a very exciting, well put together film that kept me engrossed the entire time. Character development and suspense as well as the action was all top notch. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Korean, Asian, or John Woo films.",1304121600,19,562,4.466019417475728

1136642,3,7885142647,"I don't really remember the original John Woo film very much right now, but I had a better impression of the film at the time.

So it turns out that I thought I had ordered that film, but instead I got this 2010 Korean remake.

It doesn't seem to have quite as good an impression. I can't quite put a finger on it. There's something about the cheap 80's aesthetic that makes those films better, while this film has a digital 2010 clarity. It also appears that this film was filmed using a digital camera, which is really evident during dark scenes where there is a lot of noise.

This one is also overly sentimental, lots of sappy music, lots of soap opera moments.

Because this is an Asian movie, for a western viewer like myself I'm going to mainly recognize the action sequences. The action is good -- when there is action. The bullets make for a nice splatter when they hit human bodies, some of the better effects I've seen in a movie. But other aspects feel kind of low-rent and B-movieish, and compared to better American movies, the action is simply lacking. There aren't any gripping car chases for instance.

There seems to be a lot of letdowns in the action because there is a ton of exposition about the relationship between the two brothers. It's pretty simple stuff about family, etc. It's basically about family. WHich is nice and all, but for violent noirish movies, there is typically better musing about the human condition. See: Collateral and Heat. This movie is also utterly lacking in atmospherics, with little mystery or sexiness given to the city that this takes place in. Instead, it feels very hum-dum.

Ultimately, it was boring. Forgettable.

Last thing: I've been looking at a lot of Korean plastic surgery photos lately, and one of the lead actors is clearly sculpted by the surgeon's knife. I find it distracting, but that's just me.",1365292800,,1865,4.650455927051672

1136793,5,7885142647,"A Better Tomorrow is a remake of the 1986 film with the same title, with a few minor and significant changes. This film is a stylish shoot em' up drama with stunning gun fights, and immersive dialogue.

A Better Tomorrow has a great story; a story of brothers, betrayal, and loyalty. It started off a little rough and a bit confusing, but I quickly got accustomed to the characters and their roles. There are a few amazing shootout scenes in this film that standout, especially the final 15 minute gun fight; these are brilliantly choreographed, and beatifully shot. Also, this film doesn't solely rely on its action as it alson packs in engaging dialogue/conversations. The ending of the film was intense, dark, and unexpected, like most South Korean films. This is a major plus because it doesn't follow a predictable formula, especially for those that haven't seen many South Korean films. (There are so many amazing films from this region, check out my other reviews surrounding this one for recommendations.) I enjoyed the dark/gritty tone, and the great music. The acting was also great from the entire cast.

Overall, A Better Tomorrow is an amazing action/drama film, with a great ending and amazing shootouts. I highly recommend a purchase for action and/or South Korean fans, and a rental otherwise.

A Better Tomorrow has very strong violence and blood. No sex or nudity.",1356998400,,1382,4.948275862068965

I have been a fan of John Woo for a while and his movies are always entertaining, and contain his signature ""standoffs"" and two handed gun play.

1136797,5,7885142647,"This is a Korean version by Director Song Hae-Seong, but with the collaboration of the original writer of the Hong Kong classic, John Woo. Many have complained that this does not add anything to the original and as such is inferior, however I decided to watch this with an openish mind and see what I thought, and I must say I loved it. The original is feted with shooting Chow Yun Fat to fame, starting off a rash of copycat gangster films and upping the sale of Aviator sunglasses and trench coats, so this has a lot to live up to - except about the rain coats that is, I mean Inspector Clouseu wore one.

The plot is around North Korean escapee Kim Hyeok (Jin Mo-Ju -`The Warrior' and `Real Fiction') he has been taken under the wing of a kind police Lieutenant Park and his larger than life auntie, but he also dabbles in a spot of international, illegal arms dealing. The cash he makes from that he spends trying to find his younger brother who was caught trying to escape with him and whom he left behind to face the North Korean bitter justice. This brother is Kim Cheol (Kang- woo Kim), but Hyeok has a best mate too in the shape of Yeong Choon (Seung Heon-Song) and after a deal goes very bad very quick he seeks a bungled revenge. Meanwhile little brother has escaped ben found and reunited but has refused to forgive Hyeok for abandoning him and moreover decides to become a police man putting them either side of the law.

For those who have seen the original this plays very much along the same lines, but with changes of scenery and parts of the plot. If you have not seen it then let me just say that this takes a while to do the scene setting and to pull the masks off of some of the main players. There is bags of action, and some great music too which you do tend to get with Korean cinema. The characters are just as important as the action in this and the interplay of loyalty and familial bonds is taken to the limit.

There are some good shoot outs too, but this is not a full on actioner, but you wouldn't really notice. It runs to just over 2 hours and is in Korean, English and a smattering of Russian with good to average sub titles. For Asian cinema fans this is one you will most definitely want to see and even if you saw the Chow Yun Fat 1980's version, I think this is still worth a watch.",1341878400,3,2320,4.232505643340858

The violence of the John Woo original was retained also. Others planning remakes should take note of this one to see how it should be done.
