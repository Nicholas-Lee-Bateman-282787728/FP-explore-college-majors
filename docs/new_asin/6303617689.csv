690489,4,6303617689,"This is a lovely movie, especially for family viewing. It accurately depicts children's life growing up in the Canadian prairies, back in the 1940s when things were much different from today. Director Kim Johnston is actually retelling his own childhood so the attention to accurate detail is excellent. Shot in western rural Manitoba and in Winnipeg, this will touch the soul of the viewer, especially if they have any personal link to that part of the world.",1108252800,4,460,4.987012987012987

7851695,3,6303617689,"This is a movie that will touch your emotions because it is so easy to see things from William's point of view. He has never known anything but his country life, all of his friends are living nearby and he is in love with his cousin Kate who also lives nearby. The announcement that his family is going to move to the city would seem like the end of the world for an eleven year old boy in this situation. It is a somewhat sad movie overall but does have it share of humor and uplifting moments. The acting is good and the story is easy to follow, it is still a good movie despite the omitted scene.

As for the omitted scene, in addition to the ""product details"" on the Amazon.com product page both the DVD case and the writing on the front of the DVD itself say the movie is 115 minutes. But when the movie is being played the on screen display shows it to be 1:33:47 which would round to 94 minutes. I saw this movie about fifteen years ago and I do remember one scene which is missing from this DVD. To the best of my recollection William and Kate catch a younger boy and girl playing doctor (the boy is nude but lying face down and seen only from the side). William scolds the two for this, but after William and Kate leave Kate scolds William for being so hard on the younger two because Willaim and Kate did the same thing when they were that age. This was not a critical scene just a little added humor, I would not have known anything was missing if I had not remembered the scene and noticed the time discrepancy. I would have given the DVD four stars if not for the deceptive labeling.

Another problem with Amazon.com's product page is that the video listed under ""Videos Related to This Product"" is actually from the 2006 ""The Last Winter"" staring Ron Perlman, which is a totally different movie. I tried to find a way to notify Amazon.com of this but ""Videos Related to This Product"" seems to be one thing that does not have a feedback link on the page.",1415836800,3,1967,4.25668449197861

7851697,5,6303617689,I watched this movie several years ago and had not seen it since. I remembered it as a piece of my own childhood and wanted very much to share it with nursing home residents. They did watch the  movie with me and everyone loved it. Thanks for making it easy for me to purchase this great movie.,1387324800,,294,4.157894736842105
7851698,5,6303617689,"I was introduced to this film during a film class twenty years ago.  For whatever reason, this film came to mind again recently so I found it on Amazon (hard to find).  I introduced this magical film to new friends, who felt the same way I did...a timeless gem, paints the simplicity of a hard life, and a family's transformation from what 'was' to what 'is' and can be.  Beautifully written, entertaining, and inviting.  A must see for anyone who enjoyed a special relationship with a grandparent.",1359676800,,498,4.689655172413793
7851699,5,6303617689,"This is an especially well done family movie, inspired by the great Canadian author W.O. Mitchell.
It is the near-magical story of a Canadian family living in the prairies of post-depression, post-war era of the 1940's, when men were men, women were women and kids were... kids.  The various antics & frolics of the kids is truly heart-warming, rekindling a renewed sense of wonder in all who watch it.  (A note to Canadian buyers - make sure you double check the shipping rates to Canada from the independent sellers within Amazon - twice Amazon's own (most expensive rates) - yikes!)",1297814400,,585,4.84
