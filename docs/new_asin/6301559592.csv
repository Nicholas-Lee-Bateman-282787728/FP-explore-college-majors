7813400,4,6301559592,"This is a movie with Bobby Brown and his music videos from 1989, and it's still a good movie performance with Bobby Brown. This movie has the very first music videos from Bobby's ""Don't Be Cruel"" album, and their good videos. It also features videos like ""Girlfriend,"" and ""Girl Next Door."" This movie also shows interviews with Bobby Brown talking about his music, his videos, and being with New Edition. I like the live performance with Bobby singing ""Roni"" and ""My Prorogative."" I would watch this movie along with New Edition and their music videos from the ""Past and Present"" movie that I also have on a VHS tape and that came out in the same year as this movie with Bobby Brown and his videos. This movie was even when Bobby Brown left New Edition and came out as a solo artist, so I would want to remember this with Bobby Brown and the way that he was back in that era.",1422489600,,876,4.380368098159509
7813401,5,6301559592,"I absolutely love this. The only difficulty was thst it was much harder for me to get the vhs transferred to dvd than I imagined due to the copy gaurd security feature on the tape. Its still possible, but will cost you $20 or more to get it done. Other than that this is an awesome collection of videos, live performance and interviews.",1378598400,,336,4.349206349206349

7813406,5,6301559592,"Bobby Brown was THE MAN between the years 1987 and 1991. This video, ""His Prerogative"" proves it with 8 music videos, two of them live versions in which Bobby dances and sings across the stage with energy,  confidence and hype. MC Hammer (before he 'blew up' in 1990) got his style  from Bobby Brown - particularly the 'diaper' pants that made both of their  dance moves look so good.
This video is a stunningly visual testament to  the R&B phenomenon that was Bobby Brown. Anyone who can appreciate  current-day artists like Sisquo (Thong Song), Usher (You Make Me Wanna...)  or Ginuwine (Pony) will love this video. Bobby Brown was on top of the  world, and this music video will take you back. It's rare, and infinitely  precious. His live version of ""Roni"" is incredible. I must also  add that the vast majority of the songs featured were written by Babyface.  That is, ""Every Little Step"", ""Rock Witcha"",  ""Roni"", and ""Don't Be Cruel"". There are two versions of  ""My Prerogative"" written by Blackstreet/Guy's Teddy Riley and  cool interviews that really take you back. Truly a gem...unfortunately  unavailable. On this video, Bobby lives up to his self proclaimed title,  ""King Of Stage"" for a somewhat brief magical moment in time.",960940800,10,1237,4.8798076923076925
