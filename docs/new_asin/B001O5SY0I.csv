I actually bought this movie based on the trailer........I really wanted to like this movie, the people who made this movie have no integrity or passion for the art of movie making, this film has no heart and stretches the believability factor to far past the breaking point. its just another pay check for a group of people who should be embarrassed to be associated with this movie.

  1/4 into the movie some how 4 men go from Vegas to jumping out of a plane intending to land in Cabo but ""ironically"" land in a Drug Lords backyard Paradise with lots of hot Mexican women in bathing suites, they jumped out the plane with there friends change of clothes but no money or credit cards, all the men have the personalities of a mop, but some how they have so much charisma that every one in Mexico wants to party and treat them to free every thing.

  With no money in Mexico the Groom borrows phone to call his Bride, but doesnt ask her to send money or come and get them, where none of them speaks Spanish, then they get thrown in jail with the Drug Lords daughter, and all of them ""ironically"" get bailed out by the Drug Lord, then thinking it was a good idea to run away with the Drug Lords Daughter, ""ironically"" spot a Bull Fighter trying to hang himself, with no real convincing he decides he wants to party with them, and ""ironically"" has horses for all of them to ride to his house, this is only 30 minutes into it.......

  If you budding Screenwriters are going to write a Bad Bachelor Party Movie, more TNA.",1294272000,,1644,4.381578947368421
8329726,3,B001O5SY0I,"In a round about way, this would actually be an informative film for those best men out there who might be trying to plan a unique bachelor party. This story tells of an extreme example in how to prove to the groom and his friends that the wedding is meant to be.

This is a tale of four men who embark on an unlikely journey days before the wedding they will be partaking in. Their trip across the border appears to be a chain of events that includes having to jump out of a plane, stay at a drug lord's house filled with bikini clad Latin ladies, helping a depressed matador restart his career, and so on. All whilst our soon-to-be groom is tested on whether he will end up with his bride for life or maybe someone else.

There are a few laughs scattered throughout, and the improbability of the whole story becomes cleared up in the end. All of the stars are recognizable from loads of other B films and TV shows, and they bond nicely in this light romp through the Mexican countryside. The behind the scenes gives a good insight into indie filmmaking without the talking head premise.

Not great but not bad either.",1237680000,,1119,4.3701923076923075
