7994399,5,B00009YP7Q,"I am an NRA instructor. This is, hands down, the BEST instructional video I have ever seen on self defense laws. Even though it is 20 years old, the legal principles have not changed. ""Castle Doctrine"" and ""Stand your Ground"" are just fancy names given to basic laws that have been on the books for over a century. This video addresses common myths like 'always drag him inside your house' and 'put a knife from the kitchen in his hand'. These will get you sent to prison. Lots of people think ""Castle Doctrine"" means that just because someone is in your home without your permission, it gives you the legal right to blow him away. Innocent people have been shot and killed asking for directions.",1470096000,,696,4.576
