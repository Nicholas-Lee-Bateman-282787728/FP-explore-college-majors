8573915,2,B00BUBENPG,"Islamic terrorists release an anthrax zombie virus. Dr Rober Hooke (Joe Coffey) has the cure in his lab, all he has to do is get there with his entourage of students.

The film takes 30 minutes to develop. At that point the zombies attack. The make-up needed to be taken up a notch. There was no consistency to the zombie movement. Virus zombies run. Raise from the dead zombies, foot drag. These did neither, they walked at a normal pace with a token foot drag. Who is directing this stuff?

No one has access to a gun so zombies had to be kick boxed to death or at least into submission.  The fighting choreography also left something to be desired. This is a very low recommended view. One must really love no budget films.

Most of the rest of movie is running from the zombies, hiding from the zombies or becoming a zombie. And that's about it.  Acting was OK.  Story could have been told in 15 minutes.

This movie has its moments and I like how it was all set at a college campus.  The cast work well together including Joe Coffey who also stars in the film Cam-Girl.
