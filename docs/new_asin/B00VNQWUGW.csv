7100345,5,B00VNQWUGW,"I was 14 when the deadly confrontation between the National Guard and collage anti-war protesters took place at Kent State. I remember watching the events on the evening news and what transpired that day. When it was over four students laid dead on the ground and the country was further split apart over the issue of the Vietnam war.

The ""American Experience"" program ""The Day The 60s Died"" is an in depth look at the events that occurred before, during and after that fateful in May 1970. The whole event started with the U.S. invasion into Cambodia. A lot of people including in the anti-war movement felt relieved when then President Nixon looked like he was starting to withdraw troops from Vietnam. It looked like there was an end in sight to the war. But after Nixon ordered the invasion into Cambodian countryside because of a Vietcong base in that country that the VC used to attack into South Vietnam many in the anti-war movement felt deceived by their government. It would set off a whole new explosion of protests across the country including many collage campuses. Kent Stat was among those schools. When the National Guard was called in to bring an end to the rioting and protests it set the stage for what was to come.

But this documentary doesn't just look at what happened at Kent State. It also covers the invasion into Cambodia itself and what our troops over there encountered as they tried to stop the VC from furthering entering Vietnam through Cambodia. The fighting the U.S. soldiers would face there would be far worse that what they had encountered in South Vietnam. All the while as this documentary goes along it goes back and forth between what was happening in Cambodia and what was happening at Kent State. One of the most interesting moments of this program takes place as the soldiers over in Cambodia hear the news reports on the radio of the shooting by the National Guard on the students at Kent State. Their reactions and comments were captured on film as they listened to what happened. All throughout this program there are interviews with various people from some of the protesters who were at Kent State to soldiers who were fighting in Cambodia to reporters to politicians offer their insights and viewpoints as to what was going on. It brings a whole new perspective as to what was happening. What you are getting here is an inside look as to what was taking place as the fighting in Cambodia and the shooting at Kent State was going on.

After the fighting in Cambodia and the killings at Kent State you get the aftermath of what occurred. As if the country wasn't split apart as it was with the anti-war movement it came even further apart as people took sides for the students and the National Guard. Rich against poor. Working class against students. The country probably had not felt this divided since the civil war over a hundred years ago.

This documentary is well put together. It becomes compelling to watch the more you get into the story of what happened. Even if you are not a history buff you will find yourself captivated watching just what took place. For those who were not born yet but remember hearing about this in history class here is a chance to get the full story of what happened. For those like me who were around when this occurred will certainly have memories come back of where you were when you heard about Kent State. This is a sad part of American history that must not be forgotten so it can not be repeated.",1444089600,2,3488,4.620967741935484

7100352,5,B00VNQWUGW,"Perhaps this documentary should have been named ""In-Depth, Dick Cavett Reviews the Events of Kent State"" -  with that, I hope I didn't spoil it for you. But indeed, it was a strange time: on April 30, 1970 Nixon announces that the US is invading Cambodia, people protest of course, and on a beautiful spring day, students at Kent State (Ohio) show up to display their discontent.  However, the National Guardsman also show up  ----  but they have loaded rifles.  It was a tinderbox.  Hmmmm, did the shooting take place because college students were perceived as spoiled elitists who deserved a ""spanking?"" So that brings this review back to its original premise - perhaps this documentary should have been named, ""One Nation, Again Comes to the Crossroads of Explosive Conflict.""",1439251200,4,779,4.953846153846154

7100354,4,B00VNQWUGW,"I enjoyed The Day the 60s Died to the degree that I recorded and replayed it this week. Based on these viewings, I have the following comments.

The documentary provided a good depiction of feelings and passions of an era; polarization in the US; college students vs townies; social and political idealism; rich vs poor with regard to the draft. It provided a review of some key points of the Vietnam War conflict, particularly for those who didn't live through it.

The effects added to the documentary: old TV screen image; original film footage. Personalities offered differing perspective of the events: political commentators then and now; military; newsmen; protestors/students; weathermen.

The documentary showed the build up to the Cambodian intervention, the last straw and Kent State as a critical point in our history of political activism. With widespread dissent after Kent State, including student strikes at hundreds of college campuses and reactions from the construction industry, blue collar workers in general, and Wall Street, society was divided/uncertain. 58% felt the students were at fault and only 11% felt the guard was at fault.

Reactions of the times continue to this day during similar political and social conflict: protest vs law and order; riots; outsider interventions; curfews; national guard; arson; obstructions to firemen; inflammatory language (bums then, thugs now).

Well produced, directed and edited, The Day the 60s Died is a good companion to Dick Cavetts Vietnam broadcast.",1432598400,12,1520,5.39662447257384

7100363,5,B00VNQWUGW,"With this being a PBS documentary, I was very skeptical about how fair it would be. The anti-war movement of the 1960s has been heavily romanticized and glorified and though there were semblances of righteousness in their cause, I was hoping this would not be yet another obnoxious, We changed the world piece of self-congratulatory garbage.
Thankfully, this was VERY fair-minded and nonpartisan.
It offered a substantive explanation to the events leading up to the shooting at Kent State and the invasion of Cambodia. It also offered commentary by journalists and college students and even Nixon staffers (like the often-astute Pat Buchanan, Nixons former speech writer).
While the former students offered their explanation of why they were protesting, Buchanan offered explanation from the other side of things and provided a good balance for the documentary.
What I particularly appreciated about the documentary was the willingness of even dedicated leftists like Rick Perlstein to admit that what the protesters were doing in Kent State cannot be strictly called protesting, but was rather a hybrid of protesting and rioting.
Too often, the narrative surrounding Kent State has been as follows: students were protesting and the National Guard went crazy and started shooting people.
The prevalent narrative often forgets to mention that these students were, in days prior, lighting buildings on fire which prompted the arrival of the National Guard. Such narratives also forget to mention that these protesters were throwing rocks, bottle and tear gas canisters at the Guardsmen. Ultimately, the students were responsible for the deaths at Kent State- but this conclusion is my own. The documentary does a great job of offering both sides of the argument.
The best moment comes at the end as Pat Buchanan explains that the landslide victory for Nixon served as an indication to Americas feeling about the anti-war movement.
The documentary was surprisingly entertaining. Never dry, it moved-along well and offered a wide array of opinions and analyses. Highly recommend!",1445126400,2,2075,5.368098159509202

8710771,3,B00VNQWUGW,"I expected better from PBS. The description of the events of May 4 is superficial compared with Kent State: The Day the War Came Home. Like that DVD, there is a sad lack of substantial analysis. One superiority in this production is heavy emphasis on the divide in the country. As well as identical footage of some wishing that more had been killed, this production devotes a lot of time to the post May 4 events, including a serious backlash of sentiment against the students and supporting Nixon.  Those seeking analysis of the event should turn to the large quantity of written material available.",1527897600,,600,4.769230769230769

8710776,5,B00VNQWUGW,"No single war (at least not until Iraq in 2003) was as divisive in American history as the war in Vietnam.  It divided the nation in ways that it had not been divided since the Civil War; and in a great many ways, that division has never quite fully healed.  Of all the events surrounding that war that signified just how great the divisions in our country would be, perhaps none was as great as what took place on the campus of Kent State University, a mid-size college in northeast Ohio, just 40 miles south of Cleveland, on May 4, 1970.  The events leading up to and past it are looked at in the 2015 PBS documentary THE DAY THE 60S DIED: THE KENT STATE SHOOTINGS.

As related by those who had been students at that campus during that incredibly turbulent time, along with Vietnam veterans, and, most notably, Pat Buchanan, then a speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, the Kent State tragedy was the culmination of several years of student dissent that only needed a catalyzing event to have the whole thing explode in the faces of the American people.  This event was Nixons extending of the war into Cambodia on April 30th to eliminate what he claimed were Vietcong strongholds right along the Cambodian/Vietnamese border.  Only ten days earlier, on April 20th, Nixon had continued to prop up the idea of winning a just peace in Vietnam that would not besmirch America.  Unfortunately, the Cambodian incursion and the televised speech that went along with it had the effect of pouring an immense amount of gasoline on what was already a raging firestorm.  Colleges, universities, and more than a few high schools around the nation became hotbeds of extreme dissent.  And Kent State was the flashpoint, with the campuss ROTC building being put to the torch two nights after the speech, and right after Nixon referred to the student protestors as bums.  On the orders of the very hard-right wing Ohio governor James Rhodes, the states National Guard was called in to stop the disturbances; but as with a lot of things that involved force, it only had the opposite effect.

And at 12:24 PM on May 4, 1970, for reasons that remain shrouded in controversy, a contingent of National Guard troops fired into a group of twenty protestors on a knoll on the campus.  Thirteen students were shot.  Nine were wounded, one so severely that he suffered from permanent paralysis.  Four others studentsAllison Krause; Jeffrey Miller; Sandra Scheuer; and William Schroderdied on the spot.  The killings sparked outrage among the young, and a vicious backlash among supporters of the war in general and of Nixon in particular (some even saying that more students should have been killed).  It was a savage time, one that only got worse when, on May 14th, two African-American students, Phillip Gibbs and James Earl Green, were gunned down by highway patrolmen outside a dormitory at Jackson State University in Mississippi.

THE DAY THE 60S DIED, though just a little less than an hour in length, does display the kinds of divisions that had been fracturing America for several years already, and how those fractures still exist (and may, in some ways, be more insidious now than even in 1970).  But while the establishment may have won the battle for the hearts and minds of the American public of the time, they would go on to lose not only the Vietnam War but, as the cultural warrior Buchanan admits, other even more significant wars of the American culture, with the birth of the environmental, gay rights, and womens rights movements.  As horrible as Kent State was, it was also a reminder that a lot of good can come from such horror, which is what this documentary shows with incredible force.  The ideals of the 1960s have lived on, even if the decade itself died with those four on that horrible day.",1463097600,,3801,4.765243902439025
