479727,4,6302568293,"Sometimes the combination of good writing, good direction and good casting collides into a great movie. Writer/Director Vin Diesel stars as Rick, the emotional center to a very strong ensemble of acquired family. The older brother who is finally facing the future, Rick tries to develop a new life while still taking care of his circle of strays. He rebels from his sex-filled nights against Salvatore, a womanizing freeloader and his drug-providing past with Fred, his not so bright cousin. Their unending loyalty keeps the ""family"" strong, even when he falls in love with a midwestern outsider, Heather. Perceptive and extremely witty writing keeps the pace throughout the film, and his chemistry with tony, played beautifully by f valentino morales, is worth the price of the ticket alone.",1200441600,2,792,5.1953125
479728,4,6302568293,This movie was one of my best movies. It mixes the scary side of a movie with the family as well. I really enjoyed the acting and the inclusion of the baby in the movie. This movie is alot like the hand that rocks the cradle except the babysitter was the cats. It was very fullfilling and entertaining. Don't sleep on this made for tv movie these are thest best thrillers.,1166659200,,372,4.253521126760563
479729,4,6302568293,I saw this movie on tv a couple of years ago and laughed myself silly. At the time I had a cat that looked identical to the nasty kitty in this film. Good B-Movie! No microwaving kitty!!!,1126742400,3,187,4.081081081081081

Alas and alack, those two pets are long gone, but my wife and I have three cats now so we thought, what the heck...maybe these three will enjoy it as much as our previous two.  WRONG!!!  They could have cared less..and that about sums up the movie.  If you can't get cats involved, how can humans enjoy it?  To be fair, STRAYS isn't gag your mouth bad, but it's so inane and inept, it's hard to be frightened.  Shame on Kathleen Quinlan for giving such a horrible performance; shame on Timothy Busfield for not retiring; and shame on Claudia Christian for playing such a shallow character with little if any venom.  Shame on the cats for overacting; shame on Shaun Cassidy for writing such a non-frightening movie.  Shame on me for trying to subject my cats to it!!!",1089158400,2,904,4.4363636363636365
479731,1,6302568293,"""Strays"" was a made-for-TV movie produced by the USA network.  According to some sources it was the worst made-for-TV movie USA ever made.  That tells you something right there.
The premise for this movie is one of the hoariest old cliche's in horror-movie land; urbanite family moves to the country to escape the dangers of city life, unaware of the danger lurking around their new home.  ""Strays"" adds nothing to this routine.  Now basing a movie around a hoary old cliche without the slightest significant variation doesn't necessarily make it a ""bad"" movie, it just prevents it from becoming a ""great"" movie.
What makes ""Strays"" a bad movie is its incedibly poor execution.  First, contrary to title's plurality there is really only one cat in the who actually causes any harm to the heroes.  Oh there are lots of cats around, but only one does anything more than hiss and bare its claws to the heroes.  So basically our heroes are meanced to near histeria by one single ordinary albeit foul tempered house cat.
Actually I shouldn't say ""ordinary.""  This cat repeatedly breaks the laws of physics.  It tears down a wall to get at a victim, bursts out of a microwave it has been trapped in and makes enourmous leaps into small spaces with perfect accuracy.  Of course,no explanation is given for how this cat is able to accomplish these herculean feats, it's just a regular, cheesed off cat.
Now one would not think a cheesed off cat would provide horror so much as mild irritation.  However, our heroes are incapable of dealing with this feline fiend in a remotely effective way.  The cat leaps on them and they seem incapable of prying it off.  On the rare occasions they use handy devices as impromptu weapons they ignore potentially useful things in favor of worthless ones (i.e. a long handled paint brush and a jug of water).
This isn't to say that the cats do not actually kill anyone.  I counted three human deaths in this movie, two were surprised by a cat and fell to their deaths, one was apparently crushed by the sheer weight of the cats.  Apparently the thought of killer house cats was too menacing, so the producers gave us killer house cats who can only kill by using their victims' sheer stupidity.
On the first viewing, ""Strays"" will dumbfound you with its sheer awfulness.  The second viewing (if any) will have you rolling on the floor laughing at its monumental absurdity.  By the third viewing you will realize you wasted your money by getting it, so don't.",1080691200,5,2483,4.697459584295612
479732,4,6302568293,"If you like cat movies like ""Thomasina"" or ""Cat's Eye,"" then it is worth watching. I happened upon it several years ago, and like any ""good"" bad movie will, it hooked me. I just had to see what would happen, if the cats would eliminate the people, or if they would get a clue and run away. It is like watching the dumb girl in the horror film go into the basement when she should be running out the door. You just have to see if they are too dumb to make it out. I started tracking this movie down after my mom adopted a stray cat that looked (and acted at first) like the lead cat from this movie, it was a bit freaky. What I don't understand, is the price. It was a good movie, but com'on...It just doesn't make sense. My reccomendation...

479813,2,6302568293,"A typical, bland American family moves into a secluded home (they were asking for trouble!) and are menaced by a group of rather surly and very UGLY cats in this eye-roller of a horror flick that elicits far more bemusement than fear. Despite professional execution both technically and acting wise, ""Strays"" fails to be anything more than a mildly distracting time-waster. This is one of those movies that you start and are beaten into submission by the malaise until you find yourself wandering off to fold laundry with no recollection of what you watched.

There are a few rather funny moments in the movie though:

1. There are numerous shots of cute kittens that are supposed to be scary; sometimes there's even lightning and thunder to accent the paralyzingly fear we are supposed to be feeling!

2. While explaining his suspicion that a cat has invaded their home, Timothy Bushfield explains his concerns is attributed to his dog being attacked, his bed room being  tore up and--dear mercy!--his sinuses are inflamed!

There are other choices bits of stupid dialog, but they can't save the fact that the movie is about killed cats and, well, that just isn't scary. This is yet another forgettable 90's DTV horror flick with very little worth recommending.",1427241600,,1262,4.933962264150943

479864,2,6302568293,"I have talked about this movie for years. It is the most fabulously ridiculous thing I have EVER seen! I need to share with you the highlights that make it so.

1. Old lady walks outside and hears a cat meow. We don't see the beast that made this mildly aggressive sound but we see the old lady's eyes widen with terror as though she were being attacked by a polar bear and then, cut to black.

2. A family is driving down the road when all of a sudden a cat jumps on their windshield and bounces off. Despite weighing, at most, 8 or 9 pounds, the force of the impact is enough to send the car ricocheting off the road and into a ditch, as though struck by a boulder.

3. Phone repair guy goes down into a basement and we hear that same barely-attention-worthy growl and we see...a dirty cat. For some reason this cat strikes fear into the phone guy's heart to such an extent that he flails about in hysterics running into a wall and falling to the ground. From there, about 6 other cats jump on him, walk around a little, and somehow the trauma of their tiny paws must rupture his internal organs or something cause he dies.

4. Family from #2 calls a tow truck to pull their CAR out of the DITCH. The tow truck instead comes to their HOUSE (not a ditch) and finds the phone guy's TRUCK (not a car) and proceeds to tow it away. This is despite the fact that it's appropriately parked in the driveway.

5. Now the true horror begins. The cats finally attack the family! Mom comes into the room to see her daughter's crib/bed overflowing with cats, presumably with her daughter underneath! She runs to the bed and starts flinging them away as though they were nothing more than...cats?

6. After clearing the bed, mom realizes her daughter is in the closet. The main cat is perched on the closet door. Mom runs over, pulls the door open, takes her daughter in her arms and flees the room. This marks an important shift in the movie. From this point on, the cats inexplicably begin displaying feats of strength comparable to that of a lion pride.

7. Mom foolishly runs into a room and closes the door. The door is only made of wood. What does she think will happen? Obviously, the cats' little paws manage to rip through oak like it was nothing more than a paper thin movie prop. Could a wooden door ever withstand the force of an entire pride of lions? Of course not. Foolish woman for thinking it could block the combined might of upwards of 10 house cats!

8. While mom huddles in blind terror, the main villain cat attempts to force its way into the room through a vent. It's having trouble getting through the vent and that's when mom spots a weapon! A heavy ceramic vase they were using to hold flowers. She grabs the vase, runs over to the vent, splashes the kitty with water, and then...discards the vase? Then...rips the vent off herself? Then proceeds to ignore the heavy vase opting instead to battle the cat with...pillows?

9. Dad finally returns home to find his wife outside in the grip of inconsolable terror, sobbing that their daughter is still inside the house. Not knowing what happened dad runs inside where he hears his daughter crying. Barreling through the house, he charges into the kitchen only to be stopped cold by the one sight that can freeze a fully grown, adrenaline-charged man in his tracks: house cats!

10. It's at this point that dad concocts the perfect plan: ""Baby, I want you to crawl across the room, through the cats, and out the doggy door."" Dad retains a level head despite the several things that could have happened to ruin this plan. For example, his daughter's cries for him to just walk over, pick her up, and carry her out. Even worse, his wife returns to the house and nearly barges inside to help! What hope would TWO full grown adults have of retrieving their daughter...with a few CATS standing in their way?!?

11. Once the daughter is safe, it comes time for the epic showdown. In one corner, weighing in at approximately 200 lbs, 34 year old man, Timothy Busfield. In the other, weighing upwards of 9 lbs, age unknown, a presumably male cat. The fight is on. Timothy looks frantically through the kitchen, past the obtrusive heavy metal pans and giant razor sharp steak knives, ignoring his own more than sufficient strength, or the practicality of a good hard kick, and finds instead a fire extinguisher. Unsuccessful at destroying the cat with pressurized foam, he wisely ignores the conventional wisdom of using the extinguisher for its blunt force capabilities, and instead discards it.

Timothy clearly knows that if he chose to run from the house, the cats would surely manage to bring him down by sheer force. Lions are capable of doing just that to wildebeest, and this, of course, is no different. He can't attempt to walk out. After making his daughter tip-toe through them like they were venomous cobras, the cats likely caught on to that plan and he could get scratched. Now I know what you're thinking...cats don't have venom. No, but they could have rabies! What would he do then? What, get a rabies shot you say? Like those are just lying around available at any hospital. Well, maybe. But what if it turns out that Al Qaeda destroyed every rabies vaccine in the United States? Granted, this scene creates the necessity to fill in a lot of blanks to make the stakes appropriately high, but once that's done...

The cat jumps on Timothy and the laws of physics betray him. Much like when the cat swatted their family car off the road and into a ditch, Timothy is no match for the sheer weight of the feline and is immediately pinned to the ground. Instead of flinging the cat off like it weighed less than the average pumpkin, instead of rolling over and crushing the cat like it was a small and fragile house-pet-turned-bad, he chooses the greater wisdom of prying it off (after a long and dramatic wrestling match) and traps it in a microwave. Since apparently things become far lighter when placed inside much heavier objects, Timothy is now capable of picking up both the microwave and the cat inside, and pitching it across the room.

Failing to kill the cat, Timothy resorts to his secret weapon. A small squirt gun. After seeing that four or five squirts leave the cat completely unphased, Timothy stares in such open disbelief that you would think the cat just withstood armor piercing bullets. So he resorts to the only option he has left. A frayed live wire giving off sparks. The camera pans to our two combatants, Timothy Busfield sitting on the ground holding the wire and a kitty cat perched on the kitchen counter looking down at him. I bet this is exactly what it felt like to watch gladiators standing off in ancient Rome.

With the kind of closing lines that made the 80s and 90s famous, Timothy taunts the cat with a ""Here kitty kitty,"" the cat jumps, and is killed in apparently the only way possible. The inconceivable quantities of electricity surging out of a frayed microwave plug.

It's at this point that you must shut the movie off entirely. It you do not, you will quickly see highlight #12, which proves the terror lives on. Steal your hearts for the most frightening, gut-wrenchingly terrifying part of the entire movie. As the family packs up their car and leaves the house for good, under the backdrop of ominous background music, we see that the nightmare continues. For under the house sits one lone and unprotected...kitten.",1379116800,4,7429,4.574436090225564
479865,2,6302568293,"Strays (Vin Diesel, 1997)

I have a strong suspicion, though I've never explicitly read this, that Strays was originally a short script, like Diesel's excellent first effort, Multi-Facial, that he extended to feature-length. It certainly feels that way while watching it, and given that Diesel hasn't picked up a camera in the intervening sixteen years--despite having prepared another script with the intention of directing it himself while Strays was in production--I think he may have learned some valuable lessons from that process, which is always fraught with peril for an inexperienced screenwriter.

Plot: Rick (Diesel) is a layabout, a sometime drug dealer who has seen the error of his previous womanizing, hedonistic ways and is trying to straighten himself out while still dealing the occasional quarter of pot and still hanging out with the same band of stoners and no-goodniks from the bad old days: Freddie (Bomb the System's Joey Dedio), Mike (the screen debut of Next Friday's Mike Epps), and Tony (F. Valentino Morales, a partner of Diesel's from Multi-Facial all the way up through 2005's The Pacifier), among others. He's sick of the cruising scene, sick of the people he hangs out with, sick of life in general until Heather (The Night We Never Met's Suzanne Lanza in her final big-screen appearance, as of this writing), a small-town Girl Next Door(TM), moves into the brownstone next door. Rick and Heather hit it off after being introduced at a neighborhood party, but Rick's lifestyle, and the violence he is forced to display because of it, alienate her just as much as his softer side attracts.

The good parts about this movie mirror the good parts of Multi-Facial; there's even that climactic monologue, though the piece here is far more pedestrian than the ""A Raisin in the Sun"" monologue Diesel delivers at the end of that film. And for me, that's ultimately why Strays falls flat; Diesel isn't really trying to do anything new here. It all still works, it's just working in identical ways, and it's stretched out to over four times the length. Some of the filler is good stuff; a subplot featuring Tony was lifted pretty much verbatim from Larry Clark's Kids, but it works (and honestly, it works a helluva lot better here than it did in that mess of a movie), and most of the scenes where Rick and the gang are just hanging out talking in the basketball court are good stuff; Diesel knows how to write dialogue, which may come as a surprise to those who only know him as a brainless-action-movie star. On the other hand, the rest of the filler doesn't work nearly as well--including the main romance plot. There's way too much expository stuff, people saying things that sound like they're coming out of psych 101 textbooks rather than off the tops of heads. Heather's conversation on the rooftop with the guy who introduced them? Good pebbles, that scene was a bust. (It didn't help that the male character there, whose name I have completely forgotten despite watching the movie less than twelve hours ago, is so flamboyantly gay as to be the same kind of brainless stereotype Diesel has, ironically, found himself shoehorned into since about xXx.) I think I actually cringed a couple of times while watching it. It's hard to believe that the same guy who penned the scenes about Ferdinand, the Munro Leaf kidlit classic about a bull who just wants to be loved, wrote that rooftop dialogue. (Not that the Ferdinand bits are any less heavy-handed, but at least they work within the context of the film in a way that scene never could.)

Strays is a movie that wants to be so much more than it turned out to be. And to be fair, as much of a fan of Multi-Facial as I am, I wanted it to be that much more as well. So maybe I'm a touch more disappointed than the average film viewer who comes into this knowing the softer, earlier side of Vin Diesel will be. (The reaction on the IMDB boards from those who only know him as an action star, on the other hand, is uniformly rotten, so be warned.) I can't tell you not to see it; if you're a Vin Diesel fan (or a Mike Epps fan; his career exploded not long after this in exactly the same way Diesel's did), of course you're going to hunt it down, and you should.

479897,1,6302568293,"Okay, I enjoy campy horror movies as much as the next girl.  But feral cats as villains?

I didn't find the ""villains"" all that scary.  I've dealt with my cats when they are angry.  Sure, I joke about pulling back a bloody stump when they are angry, but that's not the reality.  They can give you bad scratches and bites, but kill you?  They are tiny.  Fifteen pounds, max.  When my cats misbehave, I pick them up by the scruff (with my other hand supporting their weight.  You can hurt an adult cat when holding it by the scruff alone.) and threaten to eat them.  If they are *really* pissy, I throw a blanket over them.  In the dark, with their movements restricted, they calm down.

And the use of water as a magic kryptonite cat repellent is hilarious.  Spraying a cat with water will stop a cat from scratching the sofa.  It will *not* stop an angry cat mid-attack.  It'll just piss the cat off more.

This movie was obviously made by someone with *NO* experience with cats.  It shows a remarkable lack of understanding dealing with them.

Now I'd find this funny, but if there weren't sinister implications behind all of this.  Cats are more likely to be abused than any other domestic animal.  There are a lot of people out there with an irrational hatred and fear of cats.  This movie feeds that fear.  I'm afraid that it might lead to cats being abused, especially by children who don't have enough perspective to see how horrible and unrealistic this movie is.  As such, I can't rate it higher than a one.

Cats are misunderstood by people who don't try to see things from the perspective of a tiny predator.  They can be more loving than dogs in the right circumstances, but as long as the media continues to portray them this way people will see them as tiny terrorists.  And some will use that perception as an excuse to abuse them.",1274659200,2,1845,4.449101796407185

But, if you're a fan of movies that subtly tease your emotions through daily, realistic dialog, then you're going to love this movie.  There are plenty of laughs, infatuation, love, lust, guilt, morality, ethics... you name it.  They all come to light in this drama.  This is a great movie if you enjoy ""thinking"" movies.

479924,5,6302568293,"Strays goes beyond simple entertainment and accomplishes what every great work of art sets out to accomplish.  It elicits previously hidden emotions from its audience.  It communicates in a subtle and elegant fashion while maintaining a clarity of truth that can not be denied.  Often the elegance of our lives is misunderstood or simply overlooked by the harshness of reality.  This movie embraces the bitter and often ugly truth while quietly revealing the beauty and fragility of the human experience.  This movie changed my perspective on life and if that isn't the true definition of art then I don't know what is.

You can't just watch it once and expect to see or understand the subtleties.  The art, the passion, the feel of this movie is layered in by excellent writing, acting and directing.  It is not a slam it in your face action movie that speaks to an ignorant audience.  Strays asks the audience to sit with it and give it room to breathe its life and message in its own time and its own fashion.  Like a fine wine, taken too quickly in large gulps one misses everything that makes it special, makes it a masterpiece.  Strays will resonate with a generation and will easily become a classic.",1211760000,,1207,4.7
479925,5,6302568293,"Excellent film.  Very well written and directed by Vin Diesel.  This film is deeply touching and reaches the soul.  The struggle of ""Rick"" (Vin Diesel) coming of age and looking for love as well as a deep, emotional connection with ""Heather"" (Suzanne Lanza) plunges him into a world of vulnerability and uncertainty.  Tired of one-night stands and a meaningless existence, Rick longs for traditional romance, unconditional love, and ultimate belonging.

He is thwarted by his long-time friends played by F. Valentino Morales, Joey Dedio and Mike Epps, as they try to discourage him from entering a world that they can only dream of.

The ending leaves you somewhat intrigued.  In romance, timing is everything: does she find him again or are they two ships who sailed by one another during a magical sunset destined never to see one another again?

I give this film ""two thumbs up"".  Vin Diesel has proven time and time again his ability and diversity as an actor.  Kudos to Val, Joey, and Mike for playing the ""worst"" type of guys you could ever want to meet!

479927,5,6302568293,"This is a must see for any true Vin fans out there.  It truly shows him in a new light.

His life, up until this point has been about sex, drugs, women, and beer along with his 'brothers' and friend.

They all grew up with out their fathers in their lives and it seems that the only thing they have is each other.

""Rick"" is the oldest of the group and it seems he's the only one that has some responsibility and vision for the future.  He's ready to grow up and leave his slutty ways behind.

He wants to fall in love and he knows that after so many women in his bed, that's it's going to be hard to find a special woman because, they are too innocent and pure for someone like him to touch and bring down.

He's a low level drug dealer and he ""Doesn't do this for a living"" but for some extra cash... though they never show any of them doing a REAL job and they never tell you what that job is.

It's all lies, especially out of ""Tony's"" mouth.  He'll say anything or do anything to hook up with a woman and he had no remorse.  He finds it funny when he ends up catching something but Rick flips on him. Finally, well hopefully making the others in their group see the light.

This is a very gritty, dirty and crass film.  It is not for the family.  It is unrated but it is about an NC-17.

If you only want to see the sweet Pacifier side of Vin, then don't bother with this.  If you want to see what it was like growing up in NY in the mid 90 for a bunch of go no-wheres.  If you want to see the intelligence and seamless conversations, albeit vulgar conversations, between true friends then get this.

Vin has so much talent and only a small part of that is show here.  He made this film with little more than 40 G's and I've seen million dollar films that make this one look like Oscar winning roles.

Brilliant and raw.  And that ""Making of"" is nice to see.  Vin looks truly happy and it's almost as long as the film itself.",1200700800,24,1930,4.03957783641161

But I found it to be a romance story with a little street life in the mix.  I found the character of Rick (Vin Diesel) to be very vulnerable and needing something more in life.  He just wants to be loved, truely loved.  Not just for the way he looks or acts but for who he is when he stands alone.  I think the story shows that Vin can really embrace the role of a character who is romantic, and I hope to see more of him in these type of roles.  Overall a great life changing movie and I was still thinking about some of the lines several days after watching the movie, so watch and enjoy.",1200528000,31,739,3.9863945578231292
479929,4,6302568293,"STRAYS (or DOORMEN as his script was initially titled) marks the entry of Vin Diesel (AKA Mark Sinclair Vincent) into the film world in a very small budget (under $50,000.), independent 1997 movie he wrote, directed and acted the major role.  To appreciate this very realistic, modest, slice of New York life the film presents, it helps to watch the features added to the DVD (the film is released to the public for the first time): interviews with the cast and with Diesel give a sensitive and heartwarming background that enhances the movie experience. Though Diesel studied acting and worked in theater in New York prior to this film, it was not until he made his own film that he captured the attention of the people who make things happen. And now that Vin Diesel is a major Hollywood presence it is fascinating to see this initial opener.

The plot is simple enough: Rick (Diesel) is a minor drug dealer who also works as a bouncer with his buddy Tony (F. Valentino Morales), and hangs with Fred (Joey Dedio) and his 'brother' (Mike Epps, in his first role in film).  The guys live mainly for easy sex and camaraderie - all of the have been raised by mothers without knowing their fathers (thus, are 'strays'). As Rick matures he grows tired of his shallow lifestyle, misses the connection with his mother he never developed, and is prime bait for a relationship. Into his life steps Heather (Suzanne Lanza), a wholesome Midwestern girl, the two have a mutual attraction, but as their courtship dance progresses Heather disapproves of Rick's at times gang-like behavior and his drug dealing.  They come together in an extended park bench conversation (excellent writing)  during which they realize they each have repairs to do on their previous lives before they can enter a serious relationship.

One aspect of this little film that makes it a cut above the many others like it is the quality of natural acting Diesel draws from his cast: uncredited female actors who provide the sex interest for the men are variably excellent, and Morales, Dedio and Lanza are particularly strong in their commitment to ensemble acting.  The script is fairly strong, though the barrage of expletives becomes tiresome after a while. Yet in the end, Diesel establishes his skills as a serious actor and as a fine director and writer, and for the chance to see one of Hollywood's major talents in his nascent stage, this film is well worth watching.
