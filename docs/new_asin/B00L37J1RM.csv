8663538,1,B00L37J1RM,"wow, what a lousy and poor bootleg! It's the Aquapalooza show from 2009, but there's 6 minutes missing and the DVD starts halfway through ""Good Time"". The CMT logo was replaced by a grey stamp that says ""Alan Jackson"" and it's displayed throughout the whole show. But most importantly, the quality of the video is so incredibly low. You can find a much better and full version of this show on Youtube.",1465171200,,401,4.583333333333333

Web is full of it. DVD has very poor picture and sound. No information with disc, no booklet no nothing :( I don't even know if the Laser Media exist.",1447545600,3,310,4.183333333333334

8663542,3,B00L37J1RM,I thought this DVD was going to include a documentary about Alan Jackson and it only contains 17 songs performed at the Aquapalooza concert from several years ago.,1435881600,4,163,4.857142857142857
