5055255,5,B007512SE8,We keep collecting Cat in the Hat DVD's as my son loves them.  He gave each guest a DVD as they left his party!,1361577600,,111,3.625
5055256,5,B007512SE8,"The cat in the hat, not as mischievous but does teach about a bunch of different animals. Our son loves all his videos.",1352160000,,119,4.217391304347826
5055257,5,B007512SE8,"This is unfortunately one of the shorter discs that is available for the Cat in the Hat series.  My kids loved this one!  I'm glad they have a repeat feature built in but if the disc was a little longer it would have been a little more worth the money I paid for it.  I always assume the times will be the same on all of these but it isn't.  Since we have gotten a lot of use out of it then the extra $2 or so that I paid is probably worth it.  However, if you can get it for around $3 it's a much better deal.  I think this is completely worth getting for kids... especially ones that are not exposed to reptiles that often!  Martin Short is very entertaining in these and even as an adult I can watch them with the kids and not get too bored.",1428019200,,744,3.8874172185430464

5055261,5,B007512SE8,"Martin Short is a TERRIFIC voice for this cartoon. My kids loooove learning about nature and science with these videos! It's educational and very humorous so even if mom & dad are in the room watching it's enjoyable (no offense Dora...okay a lot of offense, your voice is like nails on a chalkboard).
