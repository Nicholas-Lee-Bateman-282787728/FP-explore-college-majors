2710289,5,B000LMPISG,this was shot in the early mid 1980's on film then VHS and now DVD.  The information on techniques is priceless and worth the money.  I should caution you he uses the lead method to shooting.,1371168000,,191,4.277777777777778
2710290,5,B000LMPISG,"An outstanding teaching video! Ken Robertson takes the viewer through the fundamentals of skeet shooting step-by-step. The presentation is very informative and covers correct shooting stance, basic skeet technique, and proper aim & lead for each of the stations. He works individually with several students -- each with varying skills and unique shooting issues. This approach is most helpful and from the various tips, I was able to correct some of my own hidden mistakes.

I've shot clay targets for many years, yet learned much from this fine instructional video. Ken is a championship shooter and an exceptional educator who is able to effectively reach both novice and experienced sportsmen. I can highly recommend this presentation to anyone wanting to shoot skeet successfully. It offers a solid foundation for the aspiring shooter... and can help correct the information gap and errors of more seasoned shooters. After watching this video several times and taking careful notes, my game has improved dramatically. Thanks much Ken!",1354147200,2,1038,5.368098159509202
2710291,5,B000LMPISG,The best dvd I've seen on trap shooting for beginners and shooters wishing to improve. Ken's instruction is clear and concise. Video is well thought out and produced. Lots of good stuff.,1310515200,,186,4.84375

8162149,2,B000LMPISG,"I am not questioning the skill of the instructor of the video however, this video uses dated technology when demonstrating hold points, lead and positioning. There are other videos on the market that clearly demonstrate such techniques needed to be successful on the skeet range.",1465689600,,279,5.222222222222222
8162150,4,B000LMPISG,Older video but still gives good foundations and tips.,1447113600,,54,5.111111111111111
8162151,5,B000LMPISG,"I was first introduced to Ken Robertsons Skeet Shooting years ago.  I can't say enough good things about his teaching method and instruction.  If you want to become profeciant at skeet shooting, follow the instruction of this dvd and you definitely will;",1443830400,,254,5.023809523809524
8162152,3,B000LMPISG,"A good video that demonstrates the basics of skeet shooting.  Apparently it is a digital version of an old VHS video, but the quality is good.  This is a good instructional DVD for the beginner and will serve as a review for someone who only shoots skeet occasionally.  Just fundamental stuff, nothing new.  Robertson takes a few shooters through each station and explains how to set up and shoot each shot.",1440720000,,407,4.690140845070423
8162153,4,B000LMPISG,"There's good & bad.
BAD:  The film was made 20 - 30 years ago, and looks like it was converted from either 16mm film or from video tape to digital.  As a result, the color is a bit washed out, and you CANNOT see the clay pigeons fly when the shooters are shooting.  This definitely takes away from the instruction.  Pachmayer DEFINITELY needs to do a ""remake.""
GOOD:  The instructions and tips are as valuable today as they were when this film was originally made.
I am a trap shooter, and I am just starting into a ""bit of skeet.""  Both the instructional film on Skeet and it's mate, the one on Trap, have a wealth of instruction and shooting tips.  In fact, you will have to review these films several times in order to be able to absorb all of what is being taught.  Without an updated version of this video, this is probably the best instructional video available at this time.",1393718400,2,881,4.361963190184049
8162154,4,B000LMPISG,"From the appearance of the people in the Video, this seems very ""dated"" but the lessons learned are still very useful.",1372723200,,118,4.666666666666667
