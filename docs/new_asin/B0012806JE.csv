8244715,1,B0012806JE,There are some interesting stories here but they are rather depressing. This video includes stories that reflect loves lost. Nothing but. There is no happy ending.,1251504000,,163,5.3076923076923075
8244716,5,B0012806JE,"I don't know what the reviewer ""Gordon Larko"" is smoking. For some reason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.
By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!",1235952000,,426,4.77027027027027
8244717,2,B0012806JE,"I was somewhat disappointed with this video.  The selections were short and apparently were made by film students.  Most of them also had to do with disappointments in love:  The guy coming on to his buddy, only to have the buddy shun him and leave; the man thinking about his boyfriend who had left him; the teacher worried about a student with whom he had shared a passionate moment.  It would have been nice to have at least one of the films where the love between two men triumphed.",1210982400,6,486,4.426966292134831
8244718,4,B0012806JE,"Alluvial's second compilation of amateur/student gay themed short films is definitely an improvement from the first such collection.  As usual, I'll review each individually, with the number of stars for the collection an average of all:

""Connected"" (2008) is probably the most shallow gay-themed short I have ever seen.  This 9 minute silent film tells the story of two gay young men who apparently met on a subway train, are together for a time, break up (the reason isn't clear) and go their separate ways, with the closing scene hinting that, like the lines of the subway, their paths may cross again.  Beautifully photographed, but rather pointless. 3 stars out of five.

Finding ""The Love Within"" (2006) is elusive for Ethan, Meg and Josh, three friends in college, when their friendship is threatened by surpressed sexual attractions coming to light.  Each has a conflict between what they feel as opposed to not wanting to jeapordize the friendships more than necessary.  Interesting fable about love and trust, nicely photographed and well paced.  Four stars out of five.

""Thermopylae"" (2005) tells the story about a high school teacher who sucumbs to the charms of his best student, then imagines dire consequences when he sees the boy and his father waiting to speak to the principal.  Set in the 1950's, but could have easily been today. Nice concept, but no surprises.  Three stars out of five.

When a ""Sexy Grandpa"" moves into the home for seniors, two of the women in residence compete for his attention and affections.  It's not to be.  Cute.  Four stars out of five.

In ""Love Death and Cars"" (1999), Kyle and Max met in high school, instantly realized they were soulmates, and haven't found anyone else they can relate to nearly as well.  The problem is that while Kyle is gay, Max is mostly straight, and in a relationship with a female doctor.  Great take on the power of unrequitted love.  Five stars out of five.

Nick is a pale, skinny high school freshman to whom next door neighbor Andy, a muscular varsity basketball star, has been ""Like A Brother"" (2002) for years. That all changes on one fateful Labor Day fishing trip, when Nick is caught up in the moment and expresses his love to Andy.  A bit cringe-inducing, but realistic.  Four stars out of five.",1208563200,11,2284,4.817480719794345
