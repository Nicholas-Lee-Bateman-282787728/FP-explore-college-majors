8410490,3,B003ZJX2YO,"The only good film on this set is Bizarre lust of a sexual deviant. I watched the other film as-well and found it to be quite boring. If you have to have any get the sub rosa dvd of Bizarre lust of a sexual deviant, that'll be the one your looking for.",1494720000,,252,3.8653846153846154
8410491,3,B003ZJX2YO,"I watched only Bizarrre etc., as I am not interested in surrealistic stuff like China White, and Bizarre is not otherwise available. It is obviously an early effort by an independent filmmaker on a minuscule budget, with actors who seem better than the material. I liked that there is less gore connected with sex than is usual for such movies. It is also interesting for its protrayal of a ""bad guy"" who is as pitiable as he is menacing, although his psychological disintegration became hard to watch, probably because it is too realistic. Some nice looking women, although one looked like a tatooed lady in an old circus (I wonder if some of her tats and pierces were fakes). Also includes a totally extraneous travelogue of St. Louis, which I actually found interesting because I have never been there.",1453248000,,805,4.798561151079137
