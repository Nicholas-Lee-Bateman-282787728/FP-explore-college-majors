1810000,5,B00007GUFY,"I have been aboard 3 of the 4 Iowa class battleships over the years. Visit one if you can, a great experience. If not, then buy this set of 3 tapes!  I first visited the Big Mo right after the surrender in 1945 on Navy Day in New York City. I was 7 years old. What a thrill. 40 years later I visited her in San Francisco for her recommissioning. Armed Marine sharpshooters stood anti-terrorist guard high above us on board. Another thrill! Then in 1999 in Honolulu anchored near the USS Arizona.  Now we could wander all over the ship and enter the superstructure and saw the original war map. The tapes recapture the experience accurately!",1180742400,3,640,4.461538461538462
1810001,5,B00007GUFY,"This film goes through the commission, World War II, Korean War, Gulf War and decommission of the Mighty Mo. crew interviews and documentary footages take place by turns. Seldom-seen shots and rarely-told stories are included, which makes it even more memorable. The surrender signing of Japan may be the most historic event of the MO, and the reason to choose her is due to the Missouri-born President Harry Truman.

The run time is about 2 hours and the bonus features share about 1 hour. I believe this film is the best to cover the Mighty MO so far, and probably forever. If you are a World War II or battleship fan, you should put this into your collections. In addition, if you are from Missouri, you should also at least watch it since it is quite moving to see a Missourian on the Missouri talking something about Missouri.",1170460800,8,831,4.614864864864865
1810002,5,B00007GUFY,"I never thought of a ship as a living being. Through the stories of the men who served aboard the Missouri, I found myself convinced that the Mighty Mo isn't just a bunch of metal plating floating above the water. It  became a family member to these men. I am very glad to have seen this  documentary and to have ""experienced"" her history from World War  II all the way through the Gulf War. I highly recommend these three videos  even if you're not a big fan of war. This documentary feels very  personable. Quite remarkable. You'll fall in love with this ship and the  men who served aboard her. Oh, the other great thing about this documentary  is that the filmmakers filmed the whole thing on board the ship.",944006400,6,712,4.430769230769231

7976381,4,B00007GUFY,Very good film on the life of the mighty mo. Got this one while at Pearl Harbor. Covers the story of the ship very well.,1422835200,,120,3.84
7976382,5,B00007GUFY,"I loved this video and watched it w/out blinking and backed it up at times. It answered my question as to where my Dad was during the signing of the surrender forms. Those that worked below stayed below, not enough room. Dad worked in the engine room & I saw it, although most equipment was removed when this was filmed, shame. Very interesting facts & will watch again a few more times. Dad, like every man that ever served on this ship loved it until their dying day. It's easy to see why.",1422489600,,491,4.290322580645161
7976383,3,B00007GUFY,I was just interested in some of the history of the Mighty Mo. Adequate for that.,1417996800,,81,4.125
7976384,3,B00007GUFY,"Having served aboard  the Mighty M0 i was hoping it would go into detail how ""She"" was  during WW-2.  Some detail about  her guns ,her speed ect.",1403395200,,145,4.2592592592592595
7976385,5,B00007GUFY,"Watching this video brought back the days I proudly walked the decks of this incredible Ship from 1989 to it's decommissioning as a crew member.  I still have my prized pictures of those days with the little bitty stripes on my arm.  I became a man on board this ship and learned what Honor truly was about.  This video is an awesome insight to those who would like to discover a piece of history.  From the start to the finish I had to watch it all alone for the first time in order to take in all the memories.  I recommend this video to any person who might have interest in finding out in what was truly the number one fighting ship of all time.  Quality is good, but the story is better.",1381968000,2,692,4.165413533834586
7976386,1,B00007GUFY,"This is a very old tv programme from 90's years.
You can see all the time many retired men from the Navy ! and only a few minutes of Missouri footage.
The movie on Tokyo bay is the worst that you can watch today.
I have watched better colour movie of Tokyo surrender in TV.

Disappointed.",1378684800,,288,4.142857142857143
7976387,4,B00007GUFY,"I was impressed by our host of DVD, Wes Carey. He was informative and funny as only one sailor to another can be. I too sailed in the navy for five years. I was moved at his tears upon coming into port for the last time aboard USS Missouri and even more upon hearing the Captain was crying too. Even now I have to wipe my tears from the iPod.... To all the USS Missouri crew of the past, retired or passed on, ""fair winds and following seas""... Corey Davis  AQ3, USN.  1983-19880",1378252800,,479,4.139784946236559
7976388,5,B00007GUFY,I received the product in a very timely fashion. It  is a great product I  would definitely use this vendor again ... Every thing was very good I was very satisfied I would definitely use again,1316649600,,193,4.333333333333333
7976389,2,B00007GUFY,"The majesty of the USS Missouri is an awesome spectacle to behold, for it is not only just a beautiful ship, (all of the Iowa Class battleships are beautiful), it is one of the last vestiges of an era when not only size mattered, but the power it projected brought belligerent nations to their knees.  I love the battleships, but this video does little to show me what they did, or what they could have done.  Instead of having professional people display this magnificient ship throughout, the video rambles on with former crewmen acting as tour guides, and although these former crewmen are loyal Missouri buffs, their interrupted style of narration becomes labored, unprofessional, and about as boring as reading a Navy technical manual.  I found myself yawning about a quarter of the way into the video, and after watching the first segment I had to turn it off as it was very boring.  Save your money for a trip to Pearl Harbor to see Might Mo, and you'll get a better appreciation for the ship rather than watching this video.",1184112000,9,1032,4.685082872928176
