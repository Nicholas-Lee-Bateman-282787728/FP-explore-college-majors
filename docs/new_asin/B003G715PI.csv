4120978,1,B003G715PI,Just saw this movie on cable and I still want my money back.  A horrible waste of time.  And where did they find this script and cast?,1315094400,2,134,3.925925925925926
4120979,4,B003G715PI,"I just saw this movie on demand and while it wasn't stellar it was a good movie. If you overlook some of the acting, which wasn't bad, but just stereotypical it was a good movie. It told 3-4 stories of how people feel in love or made it back to love. I think the purpose of the movie was to let the viewers know that love can conquer all. And for that I give it a high rating. There are too many movies with stellar acting, great graphics, and etc that don't tell any story. It's just one series of explosions after another like a porn for action junkies. This movie actually served a purpose. This movie makes you reflect. Don't go in expecting a box office movie. It cost 2 million to make. It's a low budget movie. But it's a good movie.",1313020800,,740,4.145833333333333
4120980,4,B003G715PI,I like this video because it is very entertaining as it talks about timely subjects for today's couples and singles. I recommend this movie because the topic of love in relationships and the topic of self-love are emphasized. I love hearing about peoples love stories.,1311120000,,268,4.977777777777778
4120981,4,B003G715PI,"I loved this movie Terrence Howard always gives a stella performance, love chronicles; secrets revealed was just as exciting as the first movie, it ended in a different way than I had anticipated but I loved the ending especially with vivica fox and her husband, I love happy endings and this one was great.",1308700800,,307,4.703703703703703
4120982,5,B003G715PI,"With B rated movies I usually don't expect much.  This film was a pleasant surprise.  I laughed,cryed and thought.  The talent is A list and a good storyline.",1299456000,2,158,4.571428571428571
4120983,1,B003G715PI,"Normally I'm a fan of B-movies, but Love Chronicles 2(LC2) was a complete waste of time and money!  I'm disappointed that the stars of this movie would compromise their credibility and do this trash.  Although the principle players (i.e. Vivica Fox, Rockman Dunbar, elise Neal, etc) did a decent job acting, the script and set-ups were horrible. Vivica Fox & Rockman Dunbar are only in 2 scenes in the whole 80 mins. of this movie and their scenes could easily be cut and paste to any other B-movie.

The other principle players Mike Epps and Ving Rhames are barely in this movie and you will spend the rest of the time watching a ghetto cast of ""actors"" trying to read lines.  LC2 was so low budget and awful you can actually see the overhead microphone (not sure what you call it) in one scene and terrible acting and story lines.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it can sever as a bad example to other would-be directors of how NOT to produce a film.  I'm still trying to give this movie away! PLEASE save your time and money by NOT getting this movie.",1282521600,13,1082,4.4120603015075375

8396360,1,B003G715PI,"This movie aired for free on my Direct Tv, and I STILL want to be reimbursed for my time wasted. This has got to be the most trite, filibustering, worthless piece of hood-trash garbage movie on the silver screen today. Can a movie get an award for that? For being worthless? If so, I nominate this two-bit, backwoods production.",1320019200,,328,4.576271186440678
