8620543,5,B00G4C1692,"This live DVD is great for anyone who would like to see a YOHIO concert but is unable to go. I was a bit disappointed at the sound quality in some parts, as it is difficult to hear YOHIO's singing. His voice is nearly drowned out by the music, but fortunately, that is only in about the first 2 or 3 songs. The outfits and stage lights are especially vivid and beautiful to watch. The DVD I received required an all-region DVD player, so it will likely not play on a standard USA-bought DVD player. The song selection is great and includes nearly all of his BREAK THE BORDER tracks as well as a couple of his newer songs. The ""Sakura, Chiru"" song also features a guest performance from Gackt.  Overall, it is a great live recording for YOHIO fans to add to their collection.",1433289600,,774,4.337931034482758
