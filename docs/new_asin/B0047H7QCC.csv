8418107,5,B0047H7QCC,"***SPOILER ALERT***
This is a well told account of a sobering case that makes crystal clear how widespread a problem false confessions is. Suspect after innocent suspect confesses to a heinous crime they did not commit after hours of psychological bullying by one detective, and the police and prosecutors continue to insist on their guilt despite 7 suspects' claims of innocence and DNA evidence that points to just one man who voluntarily confesses to doing it alone.

A must watch if you're interested at all in wrongful convictions and how it could happen to any of us.",1452816000,,573,4.907216494845361

The show is about four falsely convicted Navy sailors who were convicted through false convictions in spite of the fact the DNA showed that somebody completely unknown to them committed the crime. They were convicted after having been questioned over many hours of questioning until; they were completely exhausted.",1409616000,,448,5.054054054054054
8418110,3,B0047H7QCC,"I teach Criminal Justice following decades of practice, so I am familiar with interrogation and the concept of false confession. However, the responsibility for this injustice also falls on defense attorneys who fail to take these tapes and use them to their advantage. The entire American Criminal Justice system is misunderstood because we see it from the perspective of entertainment. What we see on T.V. and movies exists to entertain and keep our attention so they can sell us feminine hygiene spray! This tape is an example of the Real World and in that regard it could be used as a teaching aid or learning experience.",1395878400,,625,4.90566037735849

8418112,4,B0047H7QCC,"This is the startling account of four men dubbed the ""Norfolk Four"" who falsely confessed to the brutal rape and murder of a young woman in Virginia in the 1990s. It is an excellent examination not only of the facts of the case but of the psychological dynamics of false confessions. The abuse of power exhibited by the police interrogator and the utter lack of common sense by others in the criminal justice system will leave you shaking your head. I highly recommend it.",1362960000,4,472,4.630952380952381
