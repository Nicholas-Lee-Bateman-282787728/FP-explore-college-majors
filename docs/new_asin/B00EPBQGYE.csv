8607840,5,B00EPBQGYE,"Be aware that this DVD is about the World's Cup from 2010 in Valencia, Spain. Excellent video of the monster BMW Oracle boat as well as the challenger boat.
This DVD gives you a view of the Oracle boat that won the Cup in San Francisco Bay in 2013 as well as a great insight into Larry Ellison and his passion for sailing.
Beautiful videography with a prize winning film score.",1410048000,4,377,4.323943661971831
