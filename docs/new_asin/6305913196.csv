As for the cartoon, is it there ecause of the name Fritz, or to replicate some old-fashioned double-feature-with-cartoon experience? I don't know, but the films are wonderful. Peter Lorre is amazing.",1128297600,,364,4.887096774193548
7897491,5,6305913196,"While perhaps not quite in the same league as M and Metropolis, Spies (Spione) is really great in its own right, and a testament to the diverse film making skills of its director, Fritz Lang.
Spies is like the 'Bond' of silent films.  Indeed, watching the film its hard to believe Albert Broccoli did not use Spies as his prototype for all the James Bond films he produced.
The story opens with the assassination of a diplomat for some documents.  Chaos reigns...  but then we are introduced to the hero, No. 326.  326 is the master spy who must retrieve the documents, and save the world from the evil banker Haghi (wheelchair bound).  In between there's a woman sent to spy on 326, who in fact falls in love with him....  sure, you've seen this before but this film is the original, the real thing, filmed almost 35 years before Bond et al ever made it to the screen.
Spies is simply great fun!
This disk also includes a very scratchy Fritz the Cat cartoon, which I quite enjoyed despite its age and condition, and Lang's classic `M.' The transfer of M is not bad, but cannot compare with Criterion's version. If you buy this disk, well, you get M but the real treat is Spies.
Regarding the print of Spies, quality is not bad but hardly a great restoration either.  Still, the film is quite watchable: impressive for a 75+-year-old print.  Like Metropolis, there's a little controversy as to the run time of Spies.  This version is 90 minutes, but I've seen listings showing a German version of 178 minutes at a very slow frame rate of 16fps.  I don't know if this version has been cut, or if the 178 figure is even correct but its worth mentioning.
Also, for true Lang fans, Kino is supposed to release a fully restored version of Spies (to match Metropolis???) sometime in Fall, so perhaps the mystery will be solved then.
In any case, for now this is the best you will see of this film, and its worth buying and watching even in its present condition.  A gem of filmmaking is still a gem despite some scratches on the print!",1051488000,4,2029,4.456756756756757
7897492,5,6305913196,"Despite the incorrect running time listed for ""M"" on the packaging (""71 minutes""), this cut of ""M"" is over 98 minutes long, and contains much footage I've never seen before. It remains  a riveting thriller, and I highly recommend it. Although I'm a fan of  Lang's work, I had not seen ""Spies"" before. It was also  impressive, and quite entertaining.
I thought the DVD transfers were  good, and at this price it's a great bargain.",964915200,7,429,4.68
7897493,5,6305913196,"Hi.  Mike Cruz.  You may have seen such reviews from me as Metropolis: A classic, but not on dvd.
This double feature including Spies and M is well worth the bones.  Spies is a great transfer copy!  Good sound (for a  silent); great picture. M is the cut version, meaning it's the 71 min.  version.  However for the price, I think it is well worth it.  It even has  a Felix the Cat cartoon!
If you want to see M in all its glory, you  should get the regular dvd of M.  But the subtitles and picture and sound  for M is very good, it's just the edited version.  I have searched all over  for Spies, the film released after Metropolis.  In my opinion it is on the  same level or even better than the Mabuse films.  It is fantastic!
If  you like Lang, you must get this.  Unlike the dvd for Metropolis, you won't  be sorry!",963792000,3,820,4.101910828025478
