7725523,5,B01DX0NCZS,"So excited to have this in IMAX 4K!  Quality is beyond excellent.  Can't wait for my next trip to see my grandsons to show this to them.  I've already downloaded it onto my iPad with the coupon enclosed in the packaging.  Wasn't sure about downloading, but it was SO EASY!  I love it and I know my grandsons will, too.",1468540800,5,318,4.233333333333333
7725524,3,B01DX0NCZS,"I bought this item for the digital download, but the ""coupon"" contained in the sealed blue-ray box does not work at the download site. That site is so simple there is no extraneous information like customer support email or number: they simply offer up a way to pay an additional $19.99 to download the movie digitally, which anyone could have done initially instead of paying once to Amazon and again to the download site. Thus I am considering returning the blue-ray disk to Amazon and simply downloading the movie directly. The simplicity of the site, and the failure of a brand-new code, plus a ""secret"" way to get the movie at additional cost all makes it seem a bit ""scammish"".

Update: several days later I went back and the website (flightofthebutterfliesmovie.com) had been improved and my download worked. Now that I have watched the movie I review the movie instead of the process. I had hoped for a science-based film to summarize a number of science concepts that the Monarch demonstrates. Unfortunately, there is little science in this 44 minute film. It may have looked great in IMAX but on the little screen it isn't all that dramatically filmed either.  If this is your first exposure to the issue and environmental concepts surrounding the Monarch Butterfly then it may be ok for you, but for my AP Environmental Science class of high school freshmen it leaves me looking for a better film.",1468368000,9,1408,4.81404958677686

7725527,4,B01DX0NCZS,"For a novice monarch butterfly enthusiast, this video would be an excellent introduction to the primary North American migration and the history of the discovery of the Mexican overwintering sites, but for the more experienced and knowledgeable, it is only entertaining. I wonder what is actual footage of the butterfly in flight, and what is CGI or created imagery.  The film would be better in 3D and IMAX, but there is nothing like observing the migration in person. And most people in the U.S. have not heard of the western migration to California and the presence of monarchs around the world.  If you live in the southern Appalachian region, check out my current pictorial guide to the migration over the southern Blue Ridge Parkway.  It is available in print at Amazon.  -Mickey Hunt

7725528,5,B01DX0NCZS,I really enjoyed the 3D effects of this movie along with all the details of the life of the butterfly and the incredible close ups with amazing 3D effects that bring the butterflies right into your living room!! I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone that has an interest of the origin of the Monarch butterflies as well !!,1521417600,,340,4.683333333333334
7725529,5,B01DX0NCZS,"Outstanding video of the story of how the overwintering location of the monarch butterflies in Central Mexico was found. The DVD can only be played on a Blu-Ray player and does not include a regular DVD version, like most do. I needed this video for showing to a tour group I led in Mexico, so I had to buy a Blu-Ray player in order to play the video. It would have been nice if a regular DVD version had been included or were available.",1521158400,,437,4.214285714285714
7725530,5,B01DX0NCZS,It is a high quality account of how the Monarch butterfly migration was researched.  Along the way there are wonderful 3D views of the butterflies resting or in flight.  After all it is an iMax production for showing in the museum theaters.  Even in non 3D it would be wonderful.,1519862400,,279,4.54

7725539,5,B01DX0NCZS,"The 3D was awesome along with the resolution.  Had not been a huge fan of 3D on my TV until this movie.  At times it looked like the butterflies were coming out of the TV.  They did a great job filming this.  The only drawback is that it has too much storyline/documentary to it.
This is still well worth the purchase.  The making of the movie extra was good as well.",1513468800,4,367,4.112676056338028

7725541,4,B01DX0NCZS,"it's a documentary, not a full length feature film - the kind of film you might see in the IMAX of a science museum

as with most IMAX films the image quality is top notch, especially for the scenes involving butterflies. There are other scenes with interviews, many of which could have been done as voice-over on the butterfly scenes - the way it's done gives it a bit of a classroom feel. Explanation of the scientific parts of the content are easy to follow and pretty interesting - spoiler alert: the different generations of Monarch butterflies which develop through the migration cycle between Canada and Mexico until the cycle starts over. So Monarchs in North America only - nothing about any other species of these beautiful insects from around the world.

What's very nice is that this box contains the 4K UHD version (with HDR10 high dynamic range), but also a 3D version alongside the 2D on the included blu-ray. So if you're one of the few that have a working 3D setup, be prepared to be amazed.

If Monarchs are your thing or you want a disc to show the differences between 2D, 3D and 4K then is might be for you. As far as nature documentaries go, I'd have a closer look at BBC's Planet Earth II which is setting new standards for content and picture quality.",1512777600,2,1274,4.530434782608696

7725548,5,B01DX0NCZS,"This is a lovely documentary/drama, the 4K UHD disc is stunning to experience, absolutely beautiful visuals!
This is also THE highest quality 4K disc I have purchased yet, it loads quickly and effortlessly like a DVD.
Audio quality is also superb, wonderful 3D-like sound!
There are a number of natural scenic locations portrayed here and they are movingly life-like. Reminds me our Earth is the most amazing life support system ever devised and I try to respect it as such.

Flight Of The Butterflies is a shining example of what we can do with this new 4K Ultra High Definition technology and I am so glad it happened in my time.
Beautiful, I do love it.

I very much prefer the SDR version for personal reasons, I consider the HDR a Visual Assault!
At this setting ALL the brightest colors are made florescent and nothing I can do will make them appear  normal, contrast is also affected resulting in a dimmed picture.

So Standard (normal) Dynamic Range is for me!",1509753600,,968,4.676470588235294
7725549,5,B01DX0NCZS,So beautiful. So life-like. Highly recommended to show off your 4k HDR setup.,1509667200,,77,5.0
7725550,5,B01DX0NCZS,Thoroughly enjoyed. We have 3D and 4K and wanted to compare. The 3D in our opinion was superior as it seemed as if you could reach out and touch the butterflies. The story of the Monarch's was also very entertaining. Showed it to several friends and all enjoyed it.,1509494400,,265,4.428571428571429

7725562,5,B01DX0NCZS,What an amazing movie!  I loved the 4K version over the 3D version.  The scenery was stunning and the life cycle of the Monarch Butterfly was shown in it's entirety including metamorphosis.  One of the best nature DVDs I have purchased!,1502496000,2,236,4.7073170731707314

7725564,5,B01DX0NCZS,"I watched this film on Netflix, but I was really excited to see it in 3D - and wow, what an upgrade! It's the definitive version of the movie and even though it's not feature-length, it really does impress. It's a great way to show off a nice 3D display without committing to a long Hollywood Blockbuster - and it's also a very interesting story to boot. Definitely pick this up if you're looking to add a beautiful nature documentary to your Blu-ray 3D collection. Kudos to Shout Factory for packaging the 4K UHD and 3D discs in one package - major studios should follow that example. I definitely plan to pick up the other 3D films in this collection.",1501977600,4,653,4.45

7725571,5,B01DX0NCZS,"Excellent 3-D, the butterflies appear to fly into your room. Since this bundle lets you watch 3-D or 4K UHD I was able to compare the experience to watching it in passive 3-D and 4K  UHD on my big 65"" OLED LG.  Frankly speaking the 3-D experience was much more ""real"" and engrossing than the 4K experience despite the difference in resolution. Too bad the marketing push is for more 4K versus more 3-D.",1500249600,8,402,4.418918918918919

7725616,4,B01DX0NCZS,"I will agree with other reviewers that this is a fantastic story, I was not aware of the epic dimensions of the Monarch Butterflies' migration and to that end I enjoyed the 3D Video.
HOWEVER
As a 3D video I cannot say that it is the most impressive Video I have purchased. There are some shots where the Butterflies seemed to be flying in the room and that was delightful but otherwise this seemed to be a subject that was difficult to capture in a way that showcased the 3D format throughout the program.
I am not discouraging the purchase of this DVD....I did enjoy it but. I think my EXPECTATIONS may have been too high.

7725653,5,B01DX0NCZS,"Flight of the Butterflies is an amazing, beautifully shot film that is a wonder for the eyes. This film centers on a scientist named Fred Urquhart who, as a child, wondered where butterflies go during their migration. As an adult, he and his wife try to answer that question. Another storyline follows a butterfly named Dana as she shows you the year-long process of migration and tells the tale through three generations of monarch butterflies, following them from Texas to Toronto to Mexico.

My favorite part of Flight of the Butterflies is when Freds life's work takes place before his eyes, when he sees millions of monarch butterflies fluttering around on a mountain in Mexico. The scene is beautiful and has some rich and epic cinematography. I also like when the filmmakers use MRI footage to show a very detailed and sharp scene of a caterpillar slowly turning into a butterfly through its chrysalis.

Flight of the Butterflies was first released in IMAX theaters and I can see why. The cinematography in this film is amazing and keeps you glued to the screen. This film is also extremely educational. I knew almost nothing about butterflies before viewing this film and I learned so much in such a short period of time. I am now extremely interested in the migration process. In fact, the film makes me want to plant my own butterfly garden.

The musical score fits the subject and is tranquil and light. The lesson of this film is to always persevere. Fred Urquhart doesn't give up for forty years and always tries to reach his goal.

I recommend you watch the special features on this DVD. Behind the Scenes gives you more context on the making of this film and features interviews with the cast and crew, including one with a real life person portrayed in the movie. It's really cool to see how the crew got some of the shots and makes you realize how difficult it was to make this film. Other special features include a message from the President of Mexico.

I give Flight of the Butterflies an age rating of 7 to 13 because the film goes into some pretty complex science and history. I think older viewers will enjoy this film as well. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars. If you are interested in the topic of butterflies or if you like science in general, you'll like Flight of the Butterflies.

Easy purchase of a truly remarkable film!  What amazing videography!  And what an absolutely AWESOME Creator to have designed and then programmed monarch butterflies with God-given instincts to fly 2,000 miles across North America, generation after generation!  It was unfortunate that the film mentioned Darwin, evolution, and adaptations as if random chance plus time had anything to do with creating these amazing insects. What child would believe that a plastic replica of a monarch butterfly was not deliberately designed by someone, let alone real butterflies that live and eat and reproduce after their own kind.  Apart from deleting God from the film, we loved it!  My favorite part was when Dr. Urquhart found butterfly PS 397 in Mexico on January 9, 1976 - indisputable evidence that these butterflies migrate from Canda to Mexico!  Imagine finding a tagged butterfly amidst tens of millions of unmarked ones - Wow!  That's Providence!",1468713600,,1105,5.238636363636363
