7799220,5,1578482216,"three kids with over-active imaginations poke around in an old man's stranded ship, only to find out that's he a descedant to a famous pirate captain. the four soon become friends until a blowhole used car salesman  tries to steal the old man's treasure.  the old man is set up for a crime  he didn't commit and is sent to jail.  the kids bust him out using muskets  and rapiers and the crew steals the treasure back from the blowhole and  sets things right.  this movie is slow, but if you like pirate action with  kids involved, like Goonies, or peter pan, then you might like this one.  basically, an old man gives three funny kids real swords, and they all  start a lot of trouble.  but, even though most of it is slow, the movie is  rad, and the pirate lore is cool too.",952214400,10,775,4.268965517241379
