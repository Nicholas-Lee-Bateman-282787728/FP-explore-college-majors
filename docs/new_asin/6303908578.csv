7855211,2,6303908578,I had expected too much from this documentary movie.  It was frequently characterized with testamonials that contained little nuance and much schmaltzy sentimentality.  VHS was in VG condition.,1492128000,,193,5.857142857142857

7855213,3,6303908578,"I don't know the film maker's original intent. When I saw the film in a theater the audience laughed at the description of German child rearing as learned by Martha in a 3rd Reich child rearing school in Oberkirsh. We're a country along with other countries who are so blocked out about child trauma.

In the 19th century the worst child trauma occurred in Japan and Germany.  In Germany it was so bad that when the English and the French went on holiday they were appalled.  And we know childhood wasn't fun in England or France in the 1800s so for them to be appalled. well, you know it was bad.

The brothers in the film one can see their pain if one isn't disconnected themselves.

You can't get grants to study the rich and from what little has been surmised it is likely that in the homes of the rich children are more traumatized than in the homes of the poor.

I'll have to re-watch it (and buy it as I teach a class on recognizing child abuse) and see if this many years later the film makers were attempting to, indeed, show the world how trauma of children effect them as adults or they meant for the audience to laugh at children being traumatized.  I may then change how many stars I give it.

 Roger Ebert gave the film three stars and called it ""as fascinating for what it doesn't say as for what it does.""  Yes, I think I'm on the same page as Ebert then. Watch it for what it doesn't say.",1405036800,,1405,4.2481203007518795
7855214,5,6303908578,"I teach a college course in family and consumer sciences in which students examine human systems across the lifespan.  Martha and Ethel is a wondeful portrayal of human systems that form and become classified as families, regardless of biological ties.",1163116800,,252,5.3
7855215,5,6303908578,"This documentary was one of the best that I've seen.  The film maker did a very good job of capturing the essence of both women.  The best thing about the overall story was that it shows how influential our elderly citizens have been in regards to who children become later in life.  It's not a coincidence that these women lived long lives.  They learned the value of hard work, sacrifice and honest emotion at an early age.  Those valuable character traits are the things that provide such fortitude.  This film is a wonderful affirmation of those values.",1022630400,,557,4.690721649484536
7855216,5,6303908578,"I saw this film at the village few years ago,visiting my friends in N.YORK.I was deeply moved of how Jyll Johnstone used this two lovely women to show theirs values and theirs families lives. Amazing the way this  director works with emotions,and how colors and the absence of them,confirm  what she wanted to say.",960681600,,314,4.796296296296297
