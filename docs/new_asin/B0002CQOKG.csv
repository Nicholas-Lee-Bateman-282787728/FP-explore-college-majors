2363622,4,B0002CQOKG,"This movie is an Australian gangster movie, which isn't something you see every day. It has a bit of a Guy Ritchie feel to it, so I really liked it, being a fan of his.  Heath Ledger is great as the lead.  If you are a fan of gangster type films, or a fan of Heath Ledger, pick this one up. Very good.",1394496000,,301,3.761904761904762

2363625,4,B0002CQOKG,"Great film, certainly not run of the mill. Beginning of Heath Ledger's remarkable albeit short career. He is so youthful and sexy. He makes the movie. Easy to see why his career took off. Wish he had washed his hair. Hard to believe that an Australian film would present Australia so poorly with slums, sleaze, violence, and disreputable persons. No one had tourism in mind. Needless to say, there are no pictures of the Sydney Opera House. The violence is almost comedic at times, hard to do. No clue as where the title came from, maybe from a song listed in the credits. The big failing is that there are no subtitles, not even in English. The Australian dialect is difficult to understand to wit. I could not understand at least half the dialogue; a surprising oversight considering the involvement of Miramax and Showtime.",1386460800,,826,4.743055555555555

This one will get passed around. So glad I found it. Typically, Americans know so little about foreign movies. Too bad we miss great productions as this one is. Really glad Amazon offers such a wide, varied selection. This one is Very highly recommended.",1345248000,,417,4.9714285714285715
2363629,4,B0002CQOKG,"There have been a few film makers to try and emulate the style of Guy Richie with varying degrees of success. For my dollar this is one of the better outings.

Here's the scoop. Heath Ledger plays a barker at a strip club and wanna be hood who gets to do his first ""job"" for the big guy and he blows it. He manages to lose (get stolen) $10,000 of his boss's money and his life is now forfeit. It's a shame too because he's quite taken by a friend's sister, played by Rose Byrne, who is new in town and might help get him out of his almost life of crime.

Like in the Richie films, you have a few people whose lives intersect in ways that begin lightly but grow in gravity as things progress. And though the situations are terse there is a bit of humor thrown in to keep things a bit askew. Take the hoods for example. These are supposed to be some tough guys but they're walking around in garb that makes them look anything but tough. They wear really girly type shorts and touristy, suburban type shirts. The hand of God plays a prominent part as well. Last second saves are part of the menu here. And like ""Layer Cake"" and ""Carlitto's Way"", a seemingly minor incident early in the proceedings comes back with devastating effects later on.

This is a fun ride. Bryan Brown, Heath Ledger and Rose Byrne all do good jobs with their rolls and the secondary characters are written and acted well also. Though not a big budget movie, the production values are good enough to not let the bones show. The soundtrack is really cool. There are interesting jazz sounding pieces throughout.
This is a good watch. I see a regular number of Aussie films and I've been lucky with most of them. This is one of the better I've seen.",1319068800,2,1717,4.309597523219814
2363630,5,B0002CQOKG,"This DVD arrived in good time. I have no complaints.
Being a huge Heath Ledger fan, this was a great movie.
The huge plus is that Bryan Brown is also in it.",1316476800,,156,3.90625
2363641,2,B0002CQOKG,I was so exited to get this movie....then the last 15 minutes of the DVD were damaged and unwatchable...so disappointing. I went to youtube and watched clips of the final scenes.,1277942400,,178,4.774193548387097
2363642,5,B0002CQOKG,"This was a wonderful and unique movie that shows us the amazing talents of a young Heath Ledger and the rest of the cast, including Bryan Brown.  I saw this movie before I bought it.  I had to watch it more than once before I even bought it!! I couldn't wait for it to come in the mail!! I really enjoy this movie! It is hard to believe that Heath Ledger would have been about 19 years old when he made this.  He had true talent and is one of my favorite actors.  I would recommend this movie to any and every Heath Ledger fan, and even just any movie fan! What a great movie it is!...it's happy, sad, funny, a little actiony, and it resolves the problems at the end... I would also like to recommend all of Heath Ledger's movies.  I haven't seen all of them...yet, but what I have seen of them makes me go ahead and recommend them all! I love them!

R.I.P. Heath Ledger...you are missed!",1277856000,,888,4.16374269005848
2363643,3,B0002CQOKG,"It is not Heath Ledger's best work, in fact, I am curious as to why he agreed to do this movie at all.  But for the avid Heath Ledger fan, it is worth the watch (once), but I suggest renting this one instead of buying it.",1243209600,,221,3.8043478260869565
2363644,4,B0002CQOKG,"and Heath Ledger's smile lights up the screen. Ever since his untimely death, I've been trying to see all his work. I was lucky to find this film at a used movie store. Although I can't say this is one of my favorite flicks...I will say it is worth watching...especially if you are a Heath Ledger fan or you like action flicks. There's alot of four letter words and violence - so this isn't a film for little children. But it is a good ride and it has a nice ending. Karma - don't mess with it!",1220832000,5,494,4.103092783505154
2363645,3,B0002CQOKG,I have collected all the Heath Ledger films since his unexpected and untimely death.  This one was a bit odd for my tastes.,1216339200,,123,4.3478260869565215
2363646,5,B0002CQOKG,"Strip-club pusher, Jimmy (Heath Ledger), wants to get in with Sydney crime boss Pando (Bryan Brown), but when he finally gets his chance, things don't go to plan. Jimmy loses $10,000 of Pando's money and had to find a way of getting it back fast before Pando and his goons catch up with him.

 ""Two Hands"" is not just the best Australian movie I have ever seen, but it is one of the best movies made in any country that I have ever seen. The script of this movie is just so good. Sure, it is violent and about one third of the dialogue is made up of four-letter words, but structurally, the script is brilliant. Everything in the script has a purpose and it is fun to watch how a seemingly insignificant detail from the start of the film can pay-off in the second half. The characters in this film are also extremely well written. Writer/director Gregor Jordan doesn't just focus on Jimmy and Pando but shows all sides of the Sydney criminal community and gives Jimmy and Pando depth by showing us their families and friends. The contrast between Pando's home-life and his job is just hilarious. These characters don't feel like your standard movie criminals, they feel like real people. And finally, the acting is pretty good too. This is the film that gave Heath Ledger his big break and I can see why Hollywood started offering him film roles after this.

Australian cinema is notoriously bad. It is not uncommon to meet Australian's who just plain refuse to watch any movies made here and for a while, I was one of those people. Then I saw ""Two Hands"" (I watched it because Gregor Jordan also made ""Buffalo Soldiers"", which is one of my favourite movies) and I decided to give Australian cinema a second chance. If you are one of those people, you should give it a second chance, too, starting with ""Two Hands"".",1213056000,6,1815,4.527439024390244
2363647,5,B0002CQOKG,"This movie is doesn't seem to come with the high and artsy aspirations of, say, a ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but as far as I'm concerned, it ranks as one of Heath Ledger's best movies.  Heath isn't the only laudable element; the other actors and actresses all do very well, fully supported by a good, solid script, good soundtrack, as well as nice work by the director and cinematographer.",1211155200,,384,4.731343283582089
2363648,5,B0002CQOKG,The movie Two Hands was an action pact movie that kept you going from the minute you started watching it till the end. Heath Ledger's acting is legend.,1210550400,,151,4.428571428571429
2363649,4,B0002CQOKG,A great Australian move that depicts the low life with wry humor.  Heath Ledger plays his role with sympathy for the character without becoming at all sentimental.  The inclusion of the dead brother character was a little weird but in keeping with the tongue-in-cheek nature of the film.  If you like action films that poke fun at violence then you'll enjoy this film.,1206748800,,368,4.809523809523809
2363650,1,B0002CQOKG,"TWO HANDS (1993) is a foreign movie that will interest those viewers
looking for action, thrills of the lives of small-time gangsters in
Australia. The main drawing card is Bryan Brown, of Full Body Massage
fame (with Mimi Rogers) way back when.

The entire project and experience is well intentioned. However, it
brings into focus the essential movie ingredient, or lack thereof, of
talent. Much like a coroner dissecting corpses sees life differently
(with a different training too) than a poet versed in arts, a film
maker of documentaries is trained differently, with a diverse
skillset and innate talent than a movie entertainer. This aspect is
what makes TWO HANDS so difficult for many in the audience.

The picture is more of something that could be compulsory viewing in
public schools,  at the elementary and highschool levels, as an
educative tool about making the wrong choices in a career, and life.
It doesn't sit well for those looking for  entertainment, among
people paying for a ticket.

The strength of the picture, is the tasteful, local-artist soundtrack
selection, with a few hard rock numbers at the right moments,
throughout the picture, and the no-nonsense approach of many of the
actors. As well, it correctly brings forth the concept of ""yin and
yang"" and ""karma"" such that, sooner or later, dastardly deeds
committed will boomerang to the perpetrator.

The weak point is obviously the entire project, as a movie
experience. For starters, there is the utopic, idealistic teenage
romance that goes on from start to end, involving Heath Ledger and
Rose Byrne, pigeonholing the movie's demographics.

Next, there is the absurd massacre committed by a first-time pistol
user, a 10 to 12 year old youngster, whose pal got cut down in a
hit-and-run, bringing blowback to the gang. Did the script writer
really think experienced, skilled, practiced thugs could get mowed
down by this type of aggressor without offering defense, security,
any lookout, backups?  This point weakens the movie's credibility and
tests the audience's patience.

In addition, there is the relentless suggestion or urgent need of the
director to remind the audience that those thugs are sincere,
warm-hearted human beings, with families of their own, by frequently
showing them with their wives, their below 5 year old kids, by
showing them taking part in scrabble and chess, on a regular basis at
HQ, for example.

Another annoyance, is suggesting a bank heist's authors can't spare
more than 15 minutes in planning the entire operation. They even hire
a key member for the operation, in a youth, Ledger, who has no
experience using a pistol, or street smarts from any past ""jobs"".

Things go from bad to worse, when the script suggests someone with an
envelope containing $10 large would go swimming at the beach, leaving
the amount unprotected, even with a gangster breathing down his neck,
and even with needing to prove his value as a ""trainee"" in the
""organization"", suggesting the youngster has an IQ and thought
processes of a baboon.

Overall, over the 90 mins, this feels like a camouflaged documentary
or a twisted biography more than anything else.",1182384000,4,3156,5.059730250481696
2363681,1,B0002CQOKG,"A pathetic attempt at a gritty street life story with Heath Ledger playing a dim-witted working class man hoping to move up by working for gangsta Bryan Brown (who killed Ledger's older brother -- whose corpse occasionally talks to the camera! -- I kid you not!).

The main reason this failed for me was that the criminal behavior of Ledger's character and of two young boys' somehow made them virtuous. If you like to root for stupid people, this is your film.

I only rented this because I recently discovered Rose Bryne who has a supporting role as the love interest. This was not a promising start for that talented actress.",1179100800,6,628,4.648648648648648
2363682,4,B0002CQOKG,"Heath Ledger (Casanova, Ned Kelly) is fantastic as Jimmy who is supposed to do a clean in and out job for Pando, played by Bryan Brown (Tai-Pan, F/X movies) and delivery 10,000 dollars but he eventually loses it to some kids. Now, Pando is out to get Jimmy so he can kill him for screaming the job up. Jimmy falls in love with Alex, played by the cute Rose Byrne (The Tenants, Wicker Park) who gets caught up with Jimmy's problem. Jimmy's dead brother Michael, played by Steven Vidler (Blonde, Dog Watch) watches over him, narrates sometimes, protects his brother. The characters intertwin with one another at some point. It's Australian, yes! But this crime caper, comedy/drama, whatever you wanna call it is a scrorcher, a blazer. The direction itself is awesome and the performances are great. The best parts and the highlights would have to the the whole Bank Robbery scene and the getaway....comical and brilliant. One of the movies Heath Ledger was in before he became famous. Brown is a great badguy and Byrne, like I said is cute and that accent is adorable. Also starring David Field (Black Jack '03, Chopper), Susie Porter (Better Than Sex, Feeling Sexy) and Tom Long (The Dish, Echo Point). I recommend this highly to anyone in the crime caper genre...it's great!",1142380800,22,1274,4.795454545454546
2363683,4,B0002CQOKG,"A few years ago, I drove about 25 miles especially to buy this movie (used, on VHS) from Blockbuster.  I wanted to see everything Heath Ledger had ever acted in, and I couldn't find Two Hands anywhere else.
I'm not a big fan of black comedies, but this is a pretty good one.  There are some funny bits (particularly the parts with Heath's character's dead brother--Jimmy?), some intriguing bits (parallelism between a couple characters, for instance), and some nice little pieces of continuity in the plot (the way the plot traveled actually reminded me a little of the movie Go).
I'm glad I got the movie and watched it, but I don't think I'm going to buy the DVD; I may even sell my videotape.  I just don't watch the show that often, and I'm not sure I want my kids to have access to a show this dark & violent at a very young age.",1140307200,32,834,4.333333333333333

I wish the American Amazon site would just carry this item. If anyone has actually tried to buy it from the Canadian Amazon site, I'd appreciate a review here to let me know how it went.

2363688,5,B0002CQOKG,"A great movie, a black comedy about Jimmy (Heath Ledger), a guy who is down on his luck and not really doing much with his life. He is a bouncer at a club owned by Kings Cross crime boss Pando (Bryan Brown), and lands a job running money to an old woman in Bondi. In an unfortunate turn of events, she chokes to feath from smoking too much while he knocks on the door, and, assuming she is out, he goes for a swim on Bondi Beach. A street kid steals the money...so setting up the wonderful black comedy known as Two Hands. Also starring Rose Byrne(Troy) and Tom Long, it's one of the best movies to come out of Australia for a while.

8074778,5,B0002CQOKG,"Two Hands (1999) is an ""Australian gangster comedy"" (as Heath describes it [1]). Heath plays Jimmy, a hot, tender and simple guy mixed up with the Sydney mafia. Heath describes Jimmy as ""a young guy that ... is growing up all his life in The Cross. His mum maybe was a prostitute ... his father is dead maybe ... basically he is in a world where he believes that this is his only path in life ... he meets a lovely young lady, Alex, and she opens his eyes and let's him see that there's another light at the end of the tunnel"" [2]. Two Hands, a film alla Tarantino and, for some moments, alla Jim Jarmusch, was the first movie filmed and based on Kings Cross (Sydney's red-light district): ""It's something that we haven't really seen in Australia ... the gangster side of Sydney ... we see it on the Godfather, we see them driving around in their Rolls-Royces, but we don't see the Australian godfathers in their stubby shorts and singlets [3], drinking VBs [4] ...""[5]. The film is funny, strong and cool (without counting the ""zombie scenes"", which I didn't like at all), and the director (Gregor Jordan) and cast surrounding the amazing, wonderful and talented Heath (Bryan Brown, David Field and Rose Byrne) are amazing / Antonia Tejeda Barros

Unfortunately, the DVD does not have ENGLISH subtitles for the hearing impaired, and, if English is not your native language (like it happens to be in my case), sometimes there are words that are difficult to understand, due to the Aussie accent and slang.
