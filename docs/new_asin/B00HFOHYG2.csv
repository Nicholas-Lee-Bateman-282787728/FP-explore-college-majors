8632498,5,B00HFOHYG2,This movie is a classic .. but throw in a little 3-D and its even better. The color seems a little sharper too! If you have a 3-D smart TV- and you like this movie.. buy it!,1420156800,,173,3.7027027027027026
8632499,5,B00HFOHYG2,Brilliant movie and it includes the Oz timeline book in miniature that was included in the 75th Anniversary collectors edition which is a very nice touch. I would highly recommend this 3D Blu-Ray package,1397347200,,203,5.0
