3718887,5,B001NHZ2K2,"This is a such a well done production.  If you have a chance, watch it on Hulu while its available.  There were elements of it that reminded me of Silent Running.  The blend of various styles - the reality show concept as a narrative, along with one of the most interesting concepts of Star Trek Next Gen - the Holodeck (virtual reality viewers here) without the pomposity that seems to plague a lot of sci-fi, makes for a great show.  The acting is on the level of Battlestar Galactica (the 2nd version, not the original of 70s from Glen Larson). This could've been Fox's next Fringe.",1246233600,4,585,4.490566037735849
3718888,5,B001NHZ2K2,"If it weren't for Alan Sepinwall's blog, I would never have heard about this pilot. I am a huge fan of science fiction, and I loved ""Virtuality."" I'm SO disappointed that Fox burned it off on a Friday night in JUNE when no one is watching to see if it would capture an audience.

Excellent concept for a show. Loved the 'thriller' aspects of it, the cast was superb, the special effects were great. What more do you want, Fox?  Why not give this show a chance to find an audience before you kill it? We need more intelligent shows on tv, and with ""Battlestar Galactica"" now off the air, there is a hole on tv for us science fiction fans.

Here's to hoping the SciFi Channel picks it up...please????",1246233600,18,698,4.3538461538461535

3718902,2,B001NHZ2K2,"Intended as the pilot for a new series, this tv movie tested very poorly and wasn't picked up; not even as a mid-season replacement, which is telling.

Opens as a 12-person crew is set to attempt humanity's first interstellar voyage, traveling to the star nearest our own sun. The catch: The spaceship Phaeton and its associated costs have been ""sponsored"" by a global consortium of corporations and businesses. To help defray their investment, the crew, a mix of scientists and cultural specialists, have agreed to be filmed reality-television style; their ten-year journey captured, edited and broadcast for a weekly show dependent on ratings and advertising.

As they approach the final countdown to their go/no-go decision, a bizarre multitude of problems suddenly crop up - culminating in the death one of the crew. Was he the victim of circumstance a.k.a. bad luck, or is there something more sinister behind it? Can the remaining members continue under the scrutiny of the cameras, stuck in space for a decade with nowhere to go or escape, all while balancing the fear that one of their mates might be a psychopathic murderer?

Sound silly? Sort of, because it's a bit like one of the '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport/dp/B002L5GDZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport</a>' movies.

Would I have followed the show? No. For the exact same reason why I detest the unreality of Big Brother = contrived drama and the participation of self-indulgent narcissists. To be fair, the fictional crew of space travelers in 'Virtuality' aren't made up of the typical conniving megalomaniacs that normally populate such programs. But that's small comfort since, in some ways, they're worse.

Reason: I can't begin to understand or imagine how most of the crew were selected. As many as a third have noticeable personality disorders, the others seem borderline incompetent. Would anyone really stock such a dangerous journey with these kinds of people? Would you invest so much effort and funds on a formula destined to fail?

Or was that the point? And was the Commander's final scene a reference to a '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B00827OX56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>' twist?

Additionally, I question the producers and their thought processes: What market were they hoping to tap into? I'm actually more curious about whether or not research indicated that scifi fans also watch worthless shows like Big Brother or The Housewives Of Fill-In-The-Blank?

Would dismiss the suggestion outright as pure absurdity, if I hadn't seen wrestling on the SciFi Channel. Which I can honestly say is one of the most surreal moments of so-called entertainment I have ever experienced.

Clearly some freakishly twisted Venn diagram suggests the scifi/fantasy community and wrestling fans share some commonality. But I honestly cannot imagine what it could be.

Seriously - wrestling?!

<shrug>

So perhaps there was the tiniest iota of an idea here after all. But I can't conceive of what that might be.

And even though the character clichs were numerous, I did enjoy the production values, which were really good. No surprise as I'm a fan of Ronald Moore and Michael Taylor, the guys behind the rebooted '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica/dp/B0036EH3U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caprica/dp/B00466H3A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caprica</a>'. But I can't in good conscience say ""I liked the show"" just because it looked nice.

Overall, one can see the pair attempting a similar effort as BSG, but most of the characters of Virtuality were not accessible, too damaged, or flat-out too abrasive to engage. Could they have turned it around, smoothed out the edges? Maybe. If so, the cast deserved at least that chance.

Note:

- Cast member Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as the Mission Commander) would find much greater success in the past. You might've heard of this show, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00AB55BS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>'.",1360281600,2,4273,5.93485342019544

It's an interesting idea that could have been explored in a deeper way to make it more terrifying.  I read at one point that this was a pilot for a TV series that never went past the pilot.

3718904,1,B001NHZ2K2,"Obviously I'm coming to the discussion a bit late here, but I rented Virtuality one day about a year or so ago.  After enjoying Pandorum, Sunshine, and Moon I was looking forward to another small but high-quality sci fi movie.

Oh boy was I wrong.

Had I known that the entire premise of this movie was ""The Real World"" in space I would have not walked, but RUN away.

Ron Moore, I am personally disappointed in you.  In most of your shows your characters never quite get along.  I can roll with that.  Yet Virtuality takes that concept to an unreasonable extreme.  The people on this ship *hate* each other.  There is no discipline.  There is no fellowship.  And most of all, no basis for the hatred.  Just listen to the insults they throw at each other during simple events such as at dinner, or at a crew meeting.  And yet we are supposed to believe that these people have been tasked with saving the planet?  That *these* were the best and brightest?

With the fate of the planet on the line, why the heck would the most important expedition in the history of mankind be turned into a squabbling reality show?  And WHY would the crewmembers seriously consider voiding said mission when one (just one) of the crewmembers is diagnosed with progressively debilitating disease?  Either Lou Gehrig's or MS, I can't remember.  But that's beside the point... because remember again that the fate of the planet is at stake here.

Good lord, the ship's psychological officer appears to also be the showmaster for the aforementioned reality show, a clear conflict of interests.

But wait, the character Pike is ""killed"" in the virtual world by a mysterious stranger and he believes that this ""opens his eyes.""  And then this same stranger goes on to rape one of the female crewmembers.

WTH???  What does that have to do with anything?  Shouldn't that be freaking people out?  Why doesn't it occur to any of the crew to simply stop using/turn off the virtual reality simulator?

To top it all off, according to the final scene none of them were experiencing reality anyway.  Wonderful.  The only good thing about this revelation is that it potentially answers why everything that happened was so nonsensically stupid, but on the other hand I don't think my conclusion is exactly what the creators intended. Frankly I'm glad that this project stopped with the pilot.  I couldn't have handled additional episodes of this.

premise

the premise is totally original and lays the foundation as a plot mechanic for a plethora of character subplots.  the idea itself consists of 3 main parts: a journey to find an earth alternative, reality tv coverage of the crew, and finally their interaction with a virtual reality module whose original purpose was to keep their skills sharp.  all 3 cornerstones have immense potential to develop and we get a very good taste of it in just this pilot.

as with all reality tv, there exists a colorful cast of characters.  some are cliche, but thats a necessary ingredient in reality tv. its the clash [and potential clash] of their caricatured characteristics that will feed this show if by some miracle somebody wakes up and decides to back this show.

acting

one pilot is too short a time to judge harshly on any acting. i think they've all done a great job of brigning out sincere characters, each with their own flaws.

something of a villain seems to be developing as well and its incredibly interesting. and i mean something. will not describe further to avoid spoilers.

production values

the design aesthetic is the very realistic and acceptable present day look of all the world's space programs. nothign wild as to create a disconnect with the audience.  it allows acceptance of a very plausible problem: the loss of earth as a place to live. the design is the  beautiful white semi-hygenic look of 2001 [and the rest of 60's and 70s sci fi] and moon. still very functional looks to the design of the ship external and internally.  ron moore knows to stay away from the hyper sci fi designs and glossy looks that make some sci-fi indigestible as plausible realities.

my only complaint would be to change the graphics of the tv show within the series. i mean even in this day and age we have gone past such cheap looking graphics.

sci-fi renaissance

in conclusion this show is part of what i feel is a sci fi renaissance across multiple media: movie, games, and most of all tv.

district 9, the re-imagined battlestar galactica, moon, mass effect, sunshine... this show is right up there with them. they all, this show included, allows the audience to take real life issues and look back at them from another perspective thanks to a certain mechanism or ""gimmick"" to put it in laymens terms.

human flaws and humanity's failings are on stage here as they were in battlestar galactica, as well as humanity's penchant for hope.  i want it on.

i hope the syfy channel pick it up or maybe even HBO [who are known for taking risks with more mature cerebral shows] picks this up and i hope ron d. moore hasn't given up on it.

shoot for a miniseries with a possibility of picking it up as a full blown seaason a la BSG.",1286928000,9,3231,4.529310344827586
3718911,2,B001NHZ2K2,"This ""film"" is clearly a couple of pilot episodes of a TV series stitched together, with pauses for commercials included, but I just couldn't believe they produced a DVD version that ends with a cliffhanger, as if it was actually aTV series, leaving nothing explained to the viewer, it feels just like walking out the theater just in the middle of the movie.

That big caveat apart, the plot is quite interesting, and it is unmistakably inspired in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>'s famous ""holodeck"", a feature that provides the potential for endless twists in the storyline considering the spaceship is in a ten-year journey.

The SFX are fine considering this is TV quality.

Let's just hope that any of the networks pick it up where Fox left it since there is a lot of potential as a sci-fi story.",1275696000,3,1243,6.305882352941176
3718912,1,B001NHZ2K2,"The tl;dr version is that this movie is filled with plot holes large enough to fly a Boeing 747 through and it's just not entertaining to watch. For the longer version, keep reading. Also, there are SPOILERS up ahead, but the story isn't worth getting worked up over anyway.

So where do I even begin with this mess? How about the premise, which is all over the place. Let's see... buncha guys traveling to another solar system to check and see if it's habitable, they have a virtual reality system in place to keep themselves from getting bored, and that's not all, they're on a reality TV show, too! Yes, because obviously with the fate of the human race at stake (more on that in a bit) our first priority must be quality TV. There's so much going on, but it's all done in such a lackluster and uninteresting way that you could care less. They tried to cover too much ground all at once and it really hurts the movie.

So, yeah. The Earth is going to explode or something because of global warming and all you naughty people out there exhaling too much carbon dioxide. Shame on you--you should have smothered yourselves for the sake of the planet! But seriously, after the CRU scandal, where it was revealed that much of the global warming ""science"" has actually been fabricated, global warming doesn't really work as a world-ending menace anymore. Whatever--let's just pretend the Sun is going to explode instead. So the Sun is going to explode and kill everyone on the Earth and humanity needs to find a new planet to live on, and we're going to go looking in Epsilon Eridani. Naturally, since this could be the most important mission ever undertaken by any astronaut in history, not only are we going to trivialize it by making it a TV show, we're also going to seriously consider turning this multi-billion dollar spaceship around because one of the crewmembers has Parkinson's Disease. WHAT.

Okay, I just looked at the Wikipedia entry for Parkinson's Disease, and yes, it's not something I'd want inflicted on anyone, but it is not a lethal disease per se, merely a debilitating one. It's certainly not grounds for turning around a multi-billion dollar spaceship whose designers were not smart enough to include secondary craft in case one of the crewmembers develops some sort of affliction that will impair his ability to do his job and thus would enable us to send this person home without compromising the entire mission. Nah, that would take too much sense. They should have given the character Super Cancer, or something like that, instead. I might have bought that.

Now, on to this virtual reality system. I guess it's nice enough, aside from the creepy guy who keeps inserting himself into the virtual reality simulations and messing with the characters. I dunno, after this guy virtual-murders the first two people (being killed in the simulation doesn't really kill you, it's just unpleasant, I guess) that would be grounds for shutting down the virtual reality system. Well, you'd think they'd do that, but this movie was brought to us by the same guys who did the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, so of course the characters will take the dumbest, most self-defeating, and most hazardous option available to them, which is to leave it on, because... I'm not sure? I guess the Commander is a masochist? ""Kill me more, creepy guy! Yes! Yes!"" Even when a particularly horrifying crime is committed against one of the female crewmembers by the creepy guy, the Commander just eats it up, like having the virtual reality equivalent of Freddy Krueger coming after them is a religious experience or something.

That's what really kills this movie, and what would have killed the series that almost followed it--a virtual reality system that's going bonkers. And it doesn't work because of a very simple plot-hole: ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TURN IT OFF! But as I mentioned, because the plot demands it, the characters will always think of some incredibly dumb justification for leaving it on and continuing to suffer at the hands of VR Freddy Krueger. And remember, the sun is going to explode, destroying all life on Earth unless we find a new home. Is this VR system really more important than that? For crying out loud, just get out some board games or something if you need entertainment that badly.

Honestly? I had more fun writing this review than I did watching this movie. It's just that bad. If you want to see a better movie about a space ship crew struggling to save the human race, I'd like to recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine-Blu-ray/dp/B000Y7U98W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine [Blu-ray</a>]. Don't get me wrong, the science behind Sunshine is all screwed up, but at least the characters are more like-able and their motivations make more sense. It's also a far more compelling story of ultimate sacrifice for the greater good. Seriously, watch that film and you won't be able to believe that a space-ship crew would abort a mission to save the human race just because one of their members developed a nonfatal disease, either.

As for Virtuality, well, let's all just breathe a sigh of relief that it never became a TV series, because I for one just couldn't handle twelve more episodes of the characters not doing the most obvious thing to avoid VR Freddy Krueger (turn the VR system off, in case you forgot!).

And now if Caprica fails, it may never see the light of day anywhere. Perhaps a novel? Virtuality had all the right components to make for a brilliant Space Opera, with relative unknown actors and a premise which touches on so much of what is right and wrong with the world of today. A metaphor, a criticism, an adventure and with an underlined mystery that shook me up, I have watched this pilot several times savoring it like fine wine.

Because of this, literally all questions are left unanswered and can be extremely frustrating for most viewers.  That being said, I still rated it 5 stars since what we actually do have here is a fantastic story that had quite a bit of potential.  There is no reason to rate the actual product lower because the Fox Network, in my opinion, foolishly produced a pilot episode and then decided not to produce a full season but still wanted to air what they had (mind you, this was also originally aired on a Friday night around 8:00pm).  I do not pretend to know the reasons behind network executives' decisions, but the lack of picking up Virtuality and then airing the pilot anyway is an error in my book.

(Possible Spoiler in this paragraph) In the end, you have the beginnings of a very interesting story that I don't think we will ever see resolved.  If you can live with that and simply use your imagniation to figure out what is going on (most likely something to do with god/God since Ron Moore was involved) but all means pick this up.",1274140800,10,1200,4.502304147465438
3718915,3,B001NHZ2K2,"(Warning: may contain spoilers) This film has three main elements: science fiction, virtual reality, and a reality TV show. Combining the first two of those would still make for a credible story. The problem is the addition of the reality TV show. The ""confessional"" segments from each of the crew members slow the story down to a crawl and are frankly irritating. They belong on ""Who Will Be The Next Playmate?"" or Survivor. They have no place in any science fiction; I ended up fast-forwarding through them. (Granted, okay, good science fiction is also good fiction, but a real film with professional actors and a pro-written script can show the motives, emotions, and disappointments of a character effectively without turning every experience into mind-numbing exposition and diluting the film's emotional impact.)

A couple of other issues: No one in their right mind will spend ""a couple of hundred billion dollars"" on a 10-year, interstellar mission and fail to provide a large amount of overlap among the skill sets of crew members. Just one medical officer, just one propulsion specialist, etc.? Give me a break! Likewise, the personalities of crew members would be examined and checked down to the last detail--perhaps even involving a test mission on the ground with the crew isolated from the world. No one who could not work at peak efficiency with the other crew members would be allowed on such a mission, regardless of their depth in a specialty.

Finally, the propulsion engineer's slurred, heavily accented, and condescending explanation of a system that could accelerate the ship to relativistic speeds was just plain offensive. Were the writers trying to gloss over how the system worked, or just insult the audience?

The only thing that earns this film three stars is that it's science fiction with some pretty good talent and excellent CGI and special effects.",1273795200,2,1883,5.087378640776699
3718916,2,B001NHZ2K2,"Virtuality was going to be a TV show on Fox, but they passed on it. I didn't know that when I bought it, or else I wouldn't have. Being made for TV, it's full of bad acting and akward pauses that were meant for commercial time. And the ending does not cap off the story at all, because it was meant to continue. The story itself has a cool premise about Earth becoming inhabitale and the crew of a ship being diverted to search for a new home in a distant star system. But all that is just briefly touched on. The movie is more of a soap opera set in space than a true Science fiction film. Little science and lots of drama. The charaters are a bunch of good looking twenty somethings. (that always cracks me up)  In the ship the crew has a virtual reality device that is meant for training and recreation (nothing original here). There is a glitch or a virus in the software that messes with several of the crew and blurs the lines between reality and the vr device. They all argue about it for an hour and a half before the dumb ending. If you are looking for a good space film that is well acted and has an original story, I suggest watching Sunshine, directed by Danny Boyle.",1273276800,5,1179,4.1938325991189425
3718917,5,B001NHZ2K2,"This was actually supposed to be the pilot episode of a TV show produced for FOX. The show wasn't picked up as a series, but FOX still aired it as a TV movie.

As a TV show, this would have been spectacular. The quality of production, the exceptional performances, the character development, and the many layers of theme and story make merely watching this lone episode a telling experience about the nature of television and creativity today. If nothing else, it makes for a good case study on the problem of TV today, especially in the sci-fi arena, and a telling demonstration of what TV could be like, if TV executives were to risk making their show choices based on quality, rather than on the safety of lowest-common-denominator marketability. By the end of this movie/episode, whether you're generally a sci-fi fan or not, you'll wonder how in the hell a show like ""V"" got on the air, while this was passed on.

This is a quality, imaginative, original production that really sucks you in. As a stand-alone, the only problem is the untidy ending (as it was written in anticipation of more installments to come). There has been talk among fans and the actors that sufficient interest could still get the series picked up, if not by FOX then perhaps by SyFy, and a web page was even set up by the spouse of one actor to organize a letter-writing campaign to that end. I pray that it's not too late for this to happen. The wasted potential here is criminal.",1272499200,27,1461,4.593869731800766
3718918,5,B001NHZ2K2,"Like BSG, (and sadly unlike Caprica), this show grabs you quickly and doesn't let go. I was shocked and truly saddended to find out that FOX would not proceed with the program. And now if Caprica fails, it may never see the light of day anywhere. Perhaps a novel? Virtuality had all the right components to make for a brilliant Space Opera, with relative unknown actors and a premise which touches on so much of what is right and wrong with the world of today. A metaphor, a criticism, an adventure and with an underlined mystery that shook me up, I have watched this pilot several times savoring it like fine wine.

Someone get your act together and make this show real! I can understand FOX not wanting to take the risk, but there are many networks out there that can and should.

Absolutely highly recommended!",1269820800,,813,4.561643835616438
3718919,2,B001NHZ2K2,"Now, first off, I love BSG, have all the discs. I picked up Virtuality when I went to buy The Plan. they were having a deal where if you bought The Plan you could get Virtuality for only $5.00! So, since Moore was involved in it, I figured its probably pretty good. Boy was I disappointed.

This movie is one of the WORST I have ever seen! It takes forever before one even gets faintly interested in it. Im sorry, but it is a total waste. Thank God I only wasted $5.00 on this junk. It is an extremely boring movie. I tried to see the good in it, but its a waste of time. Its like a cross between Big Brother & Survivor in space! The plot is silly, and SPX are no better than 20 years ago.
Dont waste your time in this movie.

This movie is one I will literally throw in the trash!  I don't see how anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars at best!

I like Sarah Conner Chronicles; into 2nd season.  I liked Firefly, a real space western and I would have watched this show until it was canceled, or the studio mangled it like Heros.

I don't care for reality shows on an island, answering questions for a chance at a million, swapping families or wives or kids or dads, I'm sick to death of the canned crime scene dramas; yet when new idea comes along, you get a pilot and a season if you're lucky.  Then, studio execs try to bend it to fit the formula of reality, winning money, or crime drama.  Unfortunately, the 99% of the programming is nothing but these same tired formulas.  Too bad, but then it keeps me away from commercials and watching things like True Blood on HBO.",1247961600,4,856,4.339622641509434

8327072,3,B001NHZ2K2,"First of all, let's make something perfectly clear: ""Virtuality"" is not a TV movie. It's a pilot produced by FOX. This is an important point, because ""Virtuality"" fails miserably as a movie. It ends without tying up any of the loose ends, and leaves a big unspoken ""to be continued"" that (judging from the low ratings of the movie) we'll probably never get the answer to. So what's the point of watching the movie at all? It actually is a very good story, and it's interesting to imagine what the TV series might have been.

At its core, ""Virtuality"" is about a group of astronauts on a ten-year mission to reach a habitable planet outside the solar system. This would be a fairly interesting story in itself, but there are a couple of twists. One is that the mission is partly funded by a corporation that has turned the journey into a reality TV show. Another conflict is that, in order to combat the claustrophobia and isolation, each crew member has their own virtual reality headset that allows them to escape into fantasy worlds. The virtual reality is the real core of the story, hence the title. Each crew member has their own favorite virtual fantasy that they live in; the captain plays soldier in a Civil War simulation, two crew members are having a virtual affair in a romantic getaway, etc.

The conflict begins when a mysterious stranger begins appearing in people's VR scenarios. The stranger seems to know all about them and begins interfering with them in strange ways. There are a lot of threads that could have led to interesting story lines. The show's producer (who happens to have a major conflict of interest by also serving as the ship's psychiatrist) is constantly trying to manipulate the crew to increase the ratings, sometimes to the detriment of the mission. The crew is having second thoughts about going on the mission at all. The crew members are fighting among themselves.

I could also see how the series would explore some pretty complex issues. In a disturbing moment, one of the characters is beaten and raped inside a virtual world. When she returns to reality traumatized, she finds herself a center of an argument between the other crew members. One argues that she should just get over it because it wasn't a ""real"" rape. Another, who was raped at one time in the real world, argues that it was real in her mind. The argument becomes an interesting debate about the difference between reality and fantasy.

In the end, there's a major plot twist that one longs to see get resolved. Maybe one day there'll be a ""Virtuality II"" that ties up or continues the story. Even if there isn't, I think the movie itself is worth watching. It's an impressive work in a small package. We can only hope the creators of ""Virtuality"" (Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor) can create another pilot just as good that they actually can continue next time.",1474416000,,2877,4.691089108910891
