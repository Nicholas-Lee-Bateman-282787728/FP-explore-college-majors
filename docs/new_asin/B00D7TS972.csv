5777111,5,B00D7TS972,"I am crying tears of joy as I am writing this review. I have waited for so long for this DVD box-set to be released. I have the VHS tapes of the original ""Rock the Dragon"" version of this series, unfortunately the tapes are beginning to wear and tear from over usage of when I was a child. Now that it is coming in August I am definitely going to get it. I honestly don't care about the condition or quality of the picture because I am use to the fuzziness of it anyway. Nostalgia is ever racing in my mind as I remember the good times of watching this on Cartoon Network. I know for fact that this will be the most epic purchase of my life.",1372896000,25,641,4.015625
5777112,5,B00D7TS972,"DragonballZ is one of those animes that can be fun in short doses. The animation isn't bad for 20 year old anime. The dialogue can be cheesy, and the fight scenes are very overdone with lots of talking and exclamations of impossible and like in wrestling, someone that for the last 15 minutes has been lying half dead will get a second wind just as the bad guy is about to finish off the hero. Like many things in life you have to take it as it is, and have fun with it.",1371859200,11,470,4.064516129032258
5777113,5,B00D7TS972,"This version of the series is what made me a DBZ fan. The screaming, young, and vengeful Vegeta [...]as well as the other primary characters and dubbed music that made the series a highlight of the day after school. I actually bought these episodes on DVD a few years ago because I couldn't muster the will power to watch through the ""remastered"" versions of these early episodes (the voices and music were just non compatible). However, it seems as if they are re-releasing the version numerous of us loved {and sometimes hated in the 90s when they were rerun with no new episodes until 1999-2000s} in a higher definition with less disks than the old ocean dub dvds which I own now. I will mostly likely purchase this set if it is in higher definition (hopefully similar in appearance to the remastered sets without some of the poor cropping). I can only hope they release the original, first run, English funimation dub for the Ginyu and Frieza Sagas in HD too!",1370736000,9,963,4.637426900584796

5777123,4,B00D7TS972,"The art book is nothing special, but it's great to see this series again. I loved watching this as a kid, and was thrilled to get my hands on it.  Contains the original Ocean Dub airings of the first couple of seasons (ep 1-53), plus the first three movies. (Dead Zone, World's Strongest, Tree of Might)

If you had World's Strongest on home video as a kid, as I did, you'll notice that this isn't 100% the same - for some odd reason, the home video releases (and yes, it was Ocean dub) had the original Cha-la Head Cha-la opening a few minutes in, while this version has Rock the Dragon at the very beginning instead. TV airing was different from home video, maybe? Not too important, but worth noting. The movie is otherwise the same.

For the sake of helpfulness, I'll also note that it doesn't go through the whole thing or even to the defeat of Frieza - this contains the original airings, so it stops kinda mid-arc.

There are plenty of downsides to this release however, such as mediocre video and audio quality, a lack of any special features, and having the edited tv versions of the first three films.

All the  joke's and pun's are all there the dialog is so much better the banter is more real to me and you actual feel the emotions in the actors voice. The funimation dub is great and all but they don't have nothing on the ocean group this is the best dub in my opinion I can't even watch the funimation dub for the first three movies it just doesn't feel right but the other show's that funimation does is great and I love them I just don't like the way they pussy foot around DBZ.,1408838400,,761,3.9096774193548387

5777145,5,B00D7TS972,"More than any other show, I have to credit Dragon Ball Z with introducing me to anime as a kid. It aired early on Saturday mornings where I lived, so I could get up and watch it before my parents were awake--definitely a plus because they would have made me turn it off. The drama, the nonstop action, the addictive plots...I loved it all and never missed an episode. That is, until it stopped. Somewhere in the Namek storyline it just disappeared from TV and I never saw what happened after that. It was years before I found out the original dub group ran out of money and had to quit, and as a result there were two English dubs, with Funimation's being much better known and more popular than the Ocean dub I had seen.

When I watched the Funi versions online, though, I was nonplussed. Sure there was less editing and it wasn't quite as corny, but the voices were so different that it didn't feel ""real"" to me. The original English VA's just seemed to fit their parts better, and they brought more energy to their performances. With seemingly every other DVD release of DBZ having major issues or not being the version I was looking for, I almost gave up hope of ever seeing the first one I enjoyed so much as a kid. Well, thank goodness for this release. It is everything I was looking for and then some!

Here we get the first 53 (edited) episodes spread across several DVD's in a high-quality package with the first 3 movies and a full-color booklet included. The discs all work great with no defects. The picture isn't the best, since this is just a reproduction of a mid-90's version, but it does the job. They even left it in the original 4:3 version instead of forcing it into widescreen, which I also appreciate. I can take or leave the movies; I never saw them in the old days but it's nice that they were included.

If you love the first dub as much as I do and you want it all together in one modern and reasonably-priced package, this is as good as it will ever get, so order it right now and enjoy a nostalgia-fueled marathon!",1408147200,,2043,4.3569553805774275

5777147,3,B00D7TS972,"When I heard news that Funimation was finally releasing the episodes and movies that were originally handled by pioneer with original English voice acting with the first three movies included. I had the Pioneer release Saiyan Saga and Dead Zone on VHS, and by the time I was able to get the same episodes and the ones I did not have on DVD, it was too late. I pre-ordered this right away, but between college and work, I never got a chance to actually watch it until recently. So let's start with the good shall we?

Pros:
--------
 - Every Ocean Dub Episode and Movie Collected in one set

 - Episodes are presented in their original format (not horribly cropped like the blu-rays and orange brick DVD sets to force them into wide screen format)

 - Campy and nostalgic for those who grew up watching this in the late 90s either on Toonami or early in the morning on WB (which is now CW)

Cons:
----------
 - Packaging: DVDs are housed in very tight sleeves within a large hardcover book. I had a very hard time taking out some of the DVDs, for one sort of has to bend them to remove them from their sleeves (which makes me very uncomfortable). (-1 Star)

 - Movies are not uncut as they were in the pioneer releases. Let me clarify, the episodes of the show were never uncut in the Ocean Dub, so they are fine, the movies in the ocean dub were uncut, but in this set they are edited. (-1 Star)

 - Movies do not feature original theme ""Cha-la Head Cha-la"" as they did in their pioneer release, and Japanese closing song not used for credits. These are both rather crudely replaced with the Rock the Dragon theme. While the choice to do so on funimation's part for this release, makes some sense, it somewhat defeats the purpose of releasing a set trying to appease the nostalgic fan. (this last con is not so critical, so no stars deducted)

Other notes:
------------------
The Hardcover book that the DVDs are contained in is sort of nice, it does not really share any new information. It probably would have been better if Funimation released this in the same kind of packaging as the orange bricks, or a box of the slim plastic DVD packages.

If you already have all of the Pioneer episodes on DVD, do not bother with this, you have everything you need. If you missed out on them the first time around like I did. Go for it, you might be disappointed in the quality of the packaging and the non-uncut movies, but everything else is there.",1406505600,3,2443,4.424107142857143

5777149,3,B00D7TS972,"The bottom line:  If you own the Pioneer DVD's of the Ocean Dub, don't bother with this.  I knew this new release wasn't remastered or anything but I was expecting this to be a better DVD transfer at least.  However, it is the same grainy transfer as the pioneer DVD's, literally no different.  The book offers no additional value being incredibly basic.  I love this dub, but the video quality is quite poor unfortunately, some episodes are worse than others.  Ironically the first episode is possibly the worst of them all in terms of grainy artifacts.",1405900800,3,554,4.71875

5777151,5,B00D7TS972,Dragonball Z is one of the most nostalgic enemies of all time and one of the most definitive 90 shows ever and because of this DVD is extremely and I mean extremely well worth its price. With its 40 pages full of character biographies and tropes of the show you think that that would be what this box that is mostly known for but it actually has some pretty damn good artwork and has all even all three movies included from its era. Quite possibly the most unique thing about this entire set it also includes the incredibly awesome Shuki a Levy music that is hardly ever see anymore nowadays especially considering the back in the day eventually they recycled music from Megaman and various other shows they used to dub now you have an incredibly unique and different composition playing for watching the already very popular show. There is one thing I can complain about in terms of this box that is that while it is definitely good there is some pictures are very low quality which seems to be kind of odd considering that FUNimation is you some pretty damn good pictures in the past even for the Orange bricks. Despite this this is clearly one of the absolute best Boxset of Dragonball Z I do recommend it for anyone who used to watch the old show.,1405209600,,1251,4.467248908296943

I was under the impression it was the ENTIRE 9 seasons, I don't know if I just missed that somewhere in the product description but I'm really glad I waited til it was only $45.00 otherwise I would have been really upset. Cost wise I'm not too far off the mark, I probably would have had to spend that much or more to buy the first 3 seasons anyway but that leaves me having to find seasons 4 through 9 now. It also messes with my OCD because as a collector I would like them to all be in the same style box. (i.e. the orange brick version) The book it comes with is kind of cool showing the characters, some artwork and general stats but beyond that there's not much here. If I didn't like the show so much I would have given it a lower rating. I really think they need to put something in the product description stating that it's only the first 3 seasons and 3 of the movies. Otherwise I would have skipped this purchase.",1402012800,,1059,4.07177033492823
5777156,3,B00D7TS972,"If you want the original version of DBZ that you were probably introduced to when watching as a kid in the 90s, this is what you want. It is just as I remember it (and is my favorite english version to watch). The voice cast has a lot more realistic energy and sound than the later english casts and I think its an excellent way to experience the anime for the first time. A real highlight is the fight between Goku and Vegeta - the intensity Vegeta`s (Brian Drummond) voice really puts a charge in the air. The music is great too.

The included information book is very sloppy. The information IN the book can be found on even the most basic of wikipedia entries of DBZ. The pictures used in the book are erratic, the resolutions of the images are all over the place. some pictures are OBVIOUSLY upscaled, others very good quality (appearing on the same page no less, making the inconsistencies all the more apparent). It looks like it was made by a high schooler using photoshop for the first time. The setup for the case is just awkward. The disks are in cardboard-like sleeves and are odd to get to.

All in all, it seems like a shameless cash-grab by Funimation (and I think it is quite obvious they hold no love for this version of the dub). The price is a bit high for what it is, the book should not be considered a selling point at all. I would only recommend this if you can find it at a reasonable price - perhaps $30-40.",1401667200,9,1432,4.3
5777157,2,B00D7TS972,"It was fun to see this version of Dragon Ball Z again...at first. But then, watching it in tandem with the uncensored version, I was reminded of how much Anime was censored, edited, and changed in the US before the 2000s. Dragon Ball Z was the first thing in the world of anime to be released on uncensored, bilingual DVDs and our first taste of what anime actually was. Sometimes R-rated levels of violence, characters that ACTUALLY DIE and don't just get ""sent to another dimension"" and all kinds of content that just about any kid would see in movies that their parents let them watch yet are kept out of kids cartoons. It's astounding how much US distributors of anime used to hide from us.

The phrases were all different which really sucked. I still have the original VHS uncut version which I really enjoyed. But this version of tree of might sucks for me cause I'm use to hearing something entirely different. Now I also have worlds strongest uncut on VHS but yet again these are the edited movies and for some reason that movie had everything the uncut version had when it came to voice actors except for some of the bad language cut out which I didn't mind too much. All in all I gave this 4 stars because of this. Here I thought funimation was going to release my childhood but they kind of let me down with the movies.

On the DVDs, don't expect Dragon Box video quality, because these episodes were put together before those masters were available. The encoding is not up to standard with current releases, but this is a special case.

I purchased this for $34, so I got one HFIL of a deal for 53 episodes and 3 movies, which i'm really happy about. Since this is an artbook and the art is not spotless, I can't honestly rate it higher than 3/5. I'm very happy with the DVD content though.",1400457600,2,742,4.578947368421052

I remember the disappointment of watching Goku land on Namek and beat up Recoome in one hit, then face up against Jeice and Burter and... return to fighting Raditz. For many years I waited. Then one day I see a commercial saying ""The Second Coming"" will arrive soon. I was overjoyed! Finally NEW DBZ!

Then the original ""Ocean Dub"" disappeared. Old VHS recordings were fine and all, but where are the DVDs?

Finally, I get an email from Funimation announcing the release of the original ""Ocean Dub"" and I vowed I had to get it. I had no idea the set came with a booklet of character info and artwork plus the first three movies Dead Zone, The Worlds Strongest, and Tree of Might.

5777174,3,B00D7TS972,"This review will mostly be based on the packaging but also on the other technical aspects.

Packaging:
1) FUNimation has done a wonderful job giving an informative book with a lot of artwork for the fans but the positive views of it end here, now to the negative;
2) If you happen to find your brand new sealed discs came with scratches then don't be surprised because this kind of packaging is absolutely terrible due to it doesn't protect the discs from being scratched, so what's your solution to it? Buy a 9 Disc Case or 8-Disc + 1-Disc cases and make/print custom covers for them.
3) I could see why they did it, like an ""All-In-One Nostalgia Bundle"" for the fans but it's just bad, to say the least.

Dub:
1) This contains the Ocean Dub for the Episodes 1-53 and Films 1-3 which as we all know has some of the best voice acting for the English dub of Dragon Ball Z, this is specifically shown on the films' dub where Peter Kelamis goes all-out like the Goddess Nozawa.
2) This edition includes the script which originally had some words such as ""death"" and later on were removed, so it's somewhat ""uncut"".
3) It's dub only so means English audio, no original Japanese audio track is included.

Picture Quality:
1) Although I've never seen the original Pioneer DVDs of the Ocean Dub, seeing comparisons makes me believe that the PQ is very similar, so what you've seen before is what you're getting now.
2) It features the NEPs which is always nice to have considering it's kind of rare on a DBZ release of FUNimation nowadays.

So here you have it.",1388966400,4,1554,4.480565371024735

This does not contain the entire series, it stops before the Frieza saga. So, if you're fine with that, it's a good purchase.

The DVD's are after the 50 Pages of Artwork & are housed inside the Booklet Seperately.

Only thing that would have made it better was if the Movies were put into the DVD's with show so I Don't have to stop & Put in disc 9 seperate at every interval. other than that minor flaw it was a perfect collection.

5777187,5,B00D7TS972,"This DVD box set is the Pioneer Ocean Dub version that aired on Cartoon Network in the late 90's, it was and will always be the first and original Dragonball Z to me because this was the version I remember watching as a kid and what got me into the Anime.

This Collector's DVD set features The Saiyan Saga (episodes 1-25) The Namek Saga (episodes 26-53) and the first three movies DeadZone, The World's Strongest, and Tree of Might as they were aired on Cartoon Network.

When my brother and I were kids, we would come home from school and watch the the show that we recorded on VHS cause the show would start just as we got out of school. Since then we became fans of the show and it became the first thing my brother and I had in common.

I loved (and still do) the ocean dub version mainly cause the Ocean dub had better voice actors and better background music (in my opinion). When the show was aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami and only showed the 53 episodes I kept wondering when were they going to air the next episode or when are the going to continue the series? So when they finally aired the new episodes I was first excited then disappointed that they had changed the animation and the voices, I was like WTH why'd they change the voices. Even though I continued to watch the series as it went on that was always the thing that bothered me. The Funimation voice actors got nothing on the Ocean Group actors, especially on Scott McNeil who was the original voice of Piccolo in the Ocean Dub. He made Piccolo sound dangerous and sexy (hey I'm a girl alright and yes I'm a Dragonball Z fan. Deal with it)

5777194,3,B00D7TS972,"No one will argue that Dragon Ball Z is one of the most iconic series of all time. A series that most people with Otaku cred will cite as  integral to their love for anime so there is no point in really reviewing the show itself. Chances are you are looking at this review not because you are just getting in to Dragon Ball Z or anime but because you are a long time seasoned veteran looking to harken back to days of old. So lets review this box set on its merits alone, the one thing you have to ask yourself before buying this set is how much does nostalgia mean to you and are you willing to look past what this box set doesn't offer?
Don't get me wrong this is a beautiful box set and my would it look good on your shelf but when you get in to the real nitty gritty there really isn't much bang for your buck. Yes it's the original Westwood/Ocean dubs and yes it comes with a nice little hardcover art book but that's really about it.
There isn't much of anything in the art book that you wouldn't see in one of the inserts of the orange bricks, the image quality of the episodes is nothing really to write home about and there really aren't any special features here. It's really a bare bones cash grab that plays on the nostalgia of the fans and yes for the fans that don't already own the Pioneer releases of the Westwood dub this set is a fairly great addition but it's kind of hard to justify a close to $70.00 price tag (as of now, it was originally slated for about $90.00)when it's nothing you can't find digging around on Ebay or other shopping venues.
I was fairly disappointed at what this set could have been versus what this set actually featured. I was hoping for perhaps original Toonami bumps to go along with the episodes or possibly a Toonami like marathon feature for the episodes. Episode commentary from the original cast or something more than just trailers for other shows they want me to buy. Commercials for other series don't count as special features and to me it's pathetic to even mention that those are your special features on the box at all.
IF you are a huge fan of DBZ and you don't feel like collecting the Pioneer boxsets or you just want something pretty to go on your shelf and you have the money then I say go for it but if you are more prudent I would say stick to collecting the Pioneer boxsets and skip this version all together",1379030400,10,2375,4.254424778761062
5777195,5,B00D7TS972,"Like most reviews of this item, I also prefer the original + later episodes dubbed by Ocean Group compared to Funimation.

But I wish they would release DVDS to all the Ocean Group Dubbed DB/DBZ/DBGT Episodes that never aired in the USA. Everything on this DVD release was previously released as 20 Single DVD Volumes by Pioneer and three box sets that combined all 20 Pioneer DVD Volumes.

Also ignore anyone who says that Funimation don't have the rights to later Ocean Group Dub Episodes, because that's not how it works. Lots of third party DVD companies sign third party contracts to release other people's products on DVD, meaning Funimation & their existing DBZ contract with the Japanese owners, could easily combined a contract with Ocean Group in Canada via Funimation's high DBZ Selling Market, to release all the later DBZ + DB & DBGT Ocean Group Dub Episodes.

Personally I own the original Pioneer DVDS which are much more collectable than this DVD Box Set, because the Pioneer DVDS were released when the series actually aired on TV and when they never done any edits to the TV Versions on home video/DVD including no re-mastering, meaning the Pioneer DVDS are for a fact, 100% the TV Version we remember with no edits starting from sound to just one second of scenery.

Even if you enjoyed this growing up, re-watching the series is just as fun as the first time, except you don't have to wait a week for the next episode!

Strongly recommend for everyone!",1376524800,5,422,4.410256410256411
5777199,5,B00D7TS972,"I know that I am wrong in saying so, but, to me, these will always be the original episodes of DBZ.

I used to come home every day from school and watch this show. It certainly wasn't the first anime I had seen, but there was just something about DBZ that opened the floodgates to the genre, so to speak. I believe that part of that was the voice acting for this dub of the series. Everyone, from Goku to Ox King, had exactly just the right voice actor. Vegeta actually sounded like a villainous snake in this one as opposed to the constantly-constipated, grunting moron that he became in the more modern dubs.

Once Cartoon Network began airing episode 54+, I was devastated to see that not only had the animation and sound quality worsened, but EVERYONE had been cast a new voice actor and not one of them -- no offense -- was as good as the original crew (The Ocean Dub).

Because of this, I could never watch any of the new versions of DBZ. I found that I just constantly compared them to the old one. This collection represents such an awesome opportunity. I was more than happy to throw my money at it.

Included is the first 53 episodes spread across multiple discs, an art book, and three movies: The World's Strongest, The Tree of Might, and Dead Zone. Don't expect any HD quality here, though. These episodes are still edited (for gore, etc.) and pretty much look like they did back in the day. If there is a quality boost, it's been too long for me to tell.

If you prefer the older dub of DBZ, though, then this purchase is a no brainer.",1376352000,102,1549,4.327586206896552
5777200,5,B00D7TS972,"I have been looking forward to this for a long time. i fell in love with DBZ when it originally aired on toonami back in the day. however, the packaging of this item from amazon was absolutely terrible. this is a collectors item and they shipped it to me in a flimsy yellow envelope and not a box with bubble wrapping to protect it. in result, my items box was damaged in all 4 corners and i haven't even owned it for more than a minute or two. i am enraged by this as amazon normally takes care of shipping. as soon as i saw this damage i took pictures of the box and the flimsy envelope and requesting a return shipment and hopefully the next one i get from them is protected enough to go from Kentucky to Ohio without being squashed.... absolutely enraged. anyways.... can't wait till i can actually WATCH this...",1376352000,3,816,4.305194805194805
5777201,4,B00D7TS972,"So, this boxed set is a bit of a conundrum... it wants to be a high end release, and while the presentation certainly is, the source material is clearly inferior to previous releases (namely Dragon Boxes...)

With that in mind, this is probably the highest quality release possible for these episodes, barring a major effort to lay the dub track to the Dragon Box video (which legally I'm not even sure they could do)

So to start with the bad, which isn't really a surprise -- this is the edited Ocean Dub just like you remember it. Nothing new, no upgrade in quality. I compared it to my Pioneer Namek dvd box, and the quality may be slightly better (edit: after better/closer review, the quality is lower in many instances, as another reviewer has pointed out. I didn't really notice when not watching side by side, however), but it's not really noticeable. I watched on a Sony Blu-Ray with 5.1 Surround Sound. It didn't look or sound terrible, but it was well below Dragon Box standards... well below...

On to the good... I was very pleasantly surprised by the packaging. This comes in a thin, Dvd-book like format. If you have the James Bond 50 blu-ray, it's a thinner version of that kind of packaging, but with the Dvds on both sides of the page. In addition, the booklet that it's advertised to come with is actually integrated into the book packaging. So you have some really nice photo paper with great artwork, character relation charts (a big version of the Dragon Box 1/2 contents), and a few blurbs about this release (I was impressed they had a whole article on the ""Over 9000"" line and how it's actually dubbed incorrectly.) At any rate, I think the packaging is worth $40 or more on its own, especially since this is a limited release. This was a real high point for me.

Another good thing is that this has the next episode previews and mid-episode ""and now back to our show"" snippets included. The old Pioneer release didn't have those. The menu presentation is also clean (no animations, but hey, it's a Dvd, what did you expect?).

Something that could go either way to you are the movies included. I have the Pioneer uncut trilogy, and I was happy to find that while it was clearly the same voice actors, the dub track and music were of the edited/Shuki Levy variety. Glad to not have duplicates here. Tree of Might had some choppy cuts, so I'd infer this movie was probably the most heavily edited.

In conclusion, I would say this is a surprisingly good purchase. When I first saw this, I thought it was a shameless money grab. Now I'd revise that opinion to call it an honorable money-grab. Yes, nostalgia and my drive to get all the releases of DBZ made this a no-brainer for me, but there's enough here to warrant a purchase even if you're not a collector, especially with the high-quality packaging. Seriously, the packaging is right up there with Dragon Box, if not better (no overlapping discs). Funimation really has done a great job with the DB franchise since the Orange Bricks, and this is no exception. The question is... is this inferior version of the show (even if the music actually fits better than the early Funimation dub( in my opinion the Falconer track wasn't consistently good to me until the Perfect Cell Saga) worth the purchase for the next episode previews + packaging to you?",1375315200,10,3327,4.611486486486487

If you are considering buying this set, buy it immediately. Buy it before price goes up like The Dragon Box Vol 2. Dragon box Vol 2 went from $30.00 to $750.00.",1373760000,13,780,4.618705035971223

The collection set includes all the first edited 53 episodes of the Saiyan/Namek/Captain Ginyu Sagas on 7 discs, including an extra disc featuring the first three feature movies, Dead Zone, Worlds Strongest and Tree of Might. Even though I love the Funimation English Dub more, I really wish they could have finish continuing the Ocean Dub from beginning to end, but Im still happy to see this in its entirely. If you are a big DBZ fan, go on and buy it ASAP!",1529107200,,656,4.475

8590473,5,B00D7TS972,"As a 90's kid and Dragon Ball fan, this is one of the best Collector's sets ever.  Worth every penny to revisit my child hood.  It keeps everything authenticate to the era.  The voices, sound, music, animation all bring you back to Toonami days after school.

8590474,4,B00D7TS972,"Well finally the Ocean dub is being green lit... all I can say is its about time, Brian Drummond is my favorite version of Vegeta! He sounds perfect for the role.. I wish Ocean Studios would relase the rest of there dubbed work on dvd.  But I don't think the U.S. will ever see the rest (except for on YouTube)  honestly though Brian Drummond steals the whole show as Vegeta.... I could listen to his version all day... Saffron Henderson is great as Gohan... the only reason this isn't getting 5 out of 5, is because of the editing that went on it... my real wish, is that ocean would redub all of dbz again & make it completely uncut! Because the voice actors do an incredible job in this, & Ocean needs more respect as a dubbing studio (though they got a good come back as Death Notes team) this set is worth every penny for the pure Nostalgic value of reliving your childhood... and I recommend buying it.  Also comes with an awesome art book",1453161600,3,945,4.327683615819209

8590479,4,B00D7TS972,"A nice pack for nostalgia. Contains the original edited ocean dub of the first (cut) 53 episodes and the three movies. Picture quality looks decent, not a remaster or anything. Some deterioration is there but nothing major. The classics voice actors are just as awesomely hammy and over the top as I remember and the music is that old eerie sci-fi score from back in the day. For being heavily edited and featuring a different cast it's basically like a whole separate show and is worth checking out for anyone, though naturally it holds the most appeal for nostalgia.

There are only three drawbacks. First, while it has all three movies, it's the edited versions and not the uncut versions that were released before by Pioneer. The reasoning behind this was apparently because the edited versions hand't been released so we should want them more? Personally I would have preferred the uncut versions, since now I have to hunt down those very films from older, out of production releases. The other drawback is that this is a single release of a much larger production. Ocean also dubbed an edited version of the first story arc from Dragon Ball as well as the first Dragon Ball movie, but to get that you have to hunt down the out-of-production Saga of Goku set. Finally, this also means that there are apparently no plans for Funimation to release the later edited Ocean dub. Yes, this cast returned for the Canadian/European English dub made for television, but that version has never been released in any format in any country. It would be great as a fan to get to see these VAs return to action as the same familiar characters, and being edited would also help differentiate it form the main FUNi release, but apparently it isn't going to happen.

It's a great set, albeit overpriced. It's worth it for the nostalgia, but a full Ocean Dub set release at a more economical price would've been a much better deal.",1443657600,3,1917,4.7023809523809526
