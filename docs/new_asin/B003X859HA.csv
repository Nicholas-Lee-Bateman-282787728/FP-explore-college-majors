4215955,1,B003X859HA,"The most disappointing V.C. competition so far--I have all the other DVDs--Once again Rosen, gives us not enough music, once again we have to see VC in Moscow--by now even the dead know this, enough. The TV anchor celebrity could not pronounce Tchaikovsky.
Also I think they should change the judges, we need serious pianists as judges--
Look at the Queen Elizabeth, the Chopin, and Leeds competitions and see the results--most of their winners are major pianists today--not the same for VC winners.",1285286400,4,499,5.024096385542169
4215956,5,B003X859HA,"I viewed this documentary for the first time on PBS, initially following the television broadcast nonchalantly while working on my computer. By the end of the film, I was in tears and on my feet.

Peter Rosen has given us a gripping and sensitive portrayal of the contestants, the jury, the musicians and other people involved in the 13th Van Cliburn Piano Competition. Rosen has been criticized for focusing too much on one competitor in particular, the young Japanese Nobuyuki Tsujii. Personally, I am thankful that Rosen did
that. I became increasing drawn to the film as I started to take note of Tsujii. At the time of my first viewing, I was unaware of his blindness nor the outcome of the competition, so the gentle build-up of admiration for this seemingly ungainly young man worked perfectly on me. I was entranced by the piano performances and touched by the footage of Nobuyuki's interaction with his Fort Worth host family, the Takacs Quartet, the Fort Worth
Symphony Orchestra, and conductor James Conlon.  One scene that I can't get out of my head is that of Tsujii's mother standing alone backstage, her hands clutching at her heart and her face turned heavenward, while on stage Nobuyuki performs Rachmaninoff Concerto No 2 in the final round of the competition.

In a world beset with troubles and uncertainties, it is a privilege to witness a miracle that blossoms from a perfect storm of extraordinary talent, indomitable human spirits, and unconditional love. Bravo to Peter Rosen!

Footnote:  The  music (""Whisper of the River"")that plays on the soundtrack as the final film credits roll is composed by Nobuyuki Tsujii -- a fitting end note.",1283990400,27,1662,4.939068100358423
4215957,5,B003X859HA,a moving and informative sharing of the lives of great young pianists as they sweat  out the competition and slowly are let go...or not. One of the judges shares what he is look for to separate the technically skilled from the musically inspired.,1283472000,9,246,4.72093023255814

the usual physical flourishes commonly witnessed on the concert platform.",1361232000,,188,6.1923076923076925
4215959,4,B003X859HA,"While I was very impressed by the blind pianist Nobuyuki Tsujii who'd won the gold medal, I was actually more excited by the performances of the co-gold medalist Haochen Zhang and silver medalist Yeol Eum Son. Tsujii's performaces were great but his repertoire was a bit too typical to my taste. The ""wow"" moments for me were when Zhang played Stravinsky's ""Petrushka"" and Son did Liszt's ""Rhapsodie Espagnole."" Their technique, rhythmic sense, devotion and ceaseless passion made me so thrilled and mesmerized. I definitely saw a great potential in them. After watching this DVD, I wished more performances in full length had been featured to better understand and appreciate the pianists. And I hope I could see all the three medalists grow and stand on top.",1327968000,,760,5.0396825396825395
4215960,5,B003X859HA,"We are told that ""we entertain angels unaware""... well, in Nobuyuki, we are entertained by a young pianist from Japan who exudes all those qualities that make us feel good about life. I think Nobu's persona and playing would cause any serious viewer to wonder if God was not doing one of those rare, special 'things' in His world through this very lovable young and blind man!

  I have been following this wonderful competition for many years and have the other DVD's and tapes.  The quality and level of pianistic virtuosity displayed in the 13th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition surpasses all previous ones in my humble opinion.  Ran Dant and all 6 finalists were stunning and spectacular and you just wanted all of them to win the Gold.  Mariangelina Vocatello was my favorite, next to Nobu, but then watching and hearing Yeol Eum Som conquer the formidable Prokofiev 2nd is unbelievable also.  If you really love and appreciate piano played at its absolute finest, this dvd is for you.  Yes, I too would have liked more piano time but the human interest stories here were too good to neglect and anyway, you can go to Cliburn.tv webcast of ALL the performances that still can be seen and heard at that website.",1317427200,7,1226,4.75
4215961,1,B003X859HA,"This is no different than any other Cliburn comp. dvd. Only the players are new. It is always the same music they perform to. Time for a change. Who wants to see a contestant skip rope, eat a taco, or put on a cowboy hat. This is what they show. Only a few of the contestants are featured so you know already who is in the final 6. I am tired of watching Texans all glittered up going-'Gosh, them Chinese play real well Ma!' It is like the late Alexi Sultanov-a past winner-said-'It's a gimmick to make $$$$$ for Cliburn.""",1300147200,4,522,4.23
4215962,4,B003X859HA,"if the the bonus feature included more performances by all the other young talents, that would of been great! but it did not so i gave it 4 stars instead of five",1299024000,,161,4.0625
4215963,4,B003X859HA,"After scanning the other reviews posted here before me I must admit I'm in the minority. I've never seen the previous 12 competitions, and I had not read the results of this 13th competition before watching this DVD, another in the fine series of releases from the German company Euroarts which is imported in the US by NAXOS. Secondly, I am not a musician (sorry no coordination) but a lover of all styles of good music and a huge fan of well-done documentaries.

That said, I enjoyed this package (the film and the bonus musical performances) very much. Going in, I had no idea what the title meant and, though there is booklet with liner notes packed inside, I purposely did not read it beforehand. (And I suggest that future purchasers do the same.). I've been writing about documentaries based on competitions lately (cooking, harpists, among others). The arc of the story is usually to introduce all the contestants and then follow through as some are eliminated. You then can feel the passion and excitement as well as the anxiety of the competitors. If anything let me down with Peter Rosen's film it is that equal weight was not given to the stories of the finalists - and even the winners. I wanted to know more about Mr. Zhang from China and understand the background of the pianist from Bulgaria, whose idiosyncrasy is that he carries his own bench to competitions, and maybe more about the others too. The booklet fills us in a bit on the top three winners but that's it. It's a minor gripe but the reason for four stars instead of five. Some of the emotion that could have occurred with editing just didn't happen for me.

But, for anyone interested in classical piano music and the next generation of artists, this is a great source. Of course it also says something about the music education in the schools in the US. Unless, I missed it through Director Rosen's editing, (and I could have), none of the 29 contestants in the First Round were Americans.

There are a lot of performance excerpts in the film to satisfy the music lover and, thankfully five complete performances in the bonus section.

4215964,5,B003X859HA,"I have followed the Van Cliburn competition over the years and found this to be the best yet.  I have watched it numerous times and it seems fresh everytime I view it. The format provides insight into the competitors, the conductor and the judges in a most interesting way.  I liked it so much I had a copy of the DVD sent to another composer friend of mine here in L.A.
He just wrote to me telling me of his great joy in watching this competition and agreed that it was the best Van Cliburn competition he had seen. As usual the pianists were brilliant and the Rach 2nd and the Prokoviev 3rd were performed by many (as they are in most piano competitions)but Nobu added something very special to this competition.  I would highly recommend it!!!",1288396800,4,746,4.430656934306569
4215965,5,B003X859HA,As a piano teacher this film held great interest for me.  This is a well done portrait of the competitors of the Van Cliburn Competition and the intense pressure it takes to be chosen as a Medalist. Highly recommended.,1287964800,,218,4.589743589743589
4215966,5,B003X859HA,"Great documentary! The star of the piece and the competition is definitely Nobuyuki Tsujii. The music is beautiful and while you don't get to hear all the pieces in their entirety, which may be on purpose on part of The Cliburn Assoc.; they want you to buy the videos and cds which I strongly recommend, it's meant to show the hard work dedication and discipline that these young talented musicians must endure to get to this level. Bravos to them all for keeping this beautiful music alive and bravo to the documentary for bringing us their inspiring stories. I actually knew very little about The Van Cliburn Competition before this documentary and will certainly be following it in 4 years to see if there are more surprises.",1286496000,3,728,4.74015748031496

You see the dedication, hard work and intense moments that make this competition a world-wide phenomenon.  I have to admit,I was slightly disappointed that the anchor had trouble pronouncing well-known composers names correctly and I would have enjoyed more piano music and less ""reality TV"" moments.  Overall, this is a compelling, moving DVD that anyone who plays piano will appreciate or those who simply enjoy piano music will delight in.",1286323200,3,574,5.206521739130435

portions of the works.  There anticipation when winners are selected by the judges, and how supportive the artists are of each
other.  Truly the cream of the crop.
I would enjoy having a DVD of the latest competition.
