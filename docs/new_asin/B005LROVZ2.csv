8478421,2,B005LROVZ2,I didn't feel the doc had an overall point. It was great to hear about and from Kupuna but I didn't get the point.,1373414400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8478422,5,B005LROVZ2,"Being from the Big Island, I can relate to all that was documented here. For those of us who have moved away from the Islands, this is a great video to share with those who want to know where you came from and how you're parents lived in the old days. The search for perserving the Hawaiian music couldn't get any better then how it was documented in this DVD...well worth to adding to your collection of Hawaii's lost history. Again a big Mahalo to Uncle Eddie Kamae for all that his done.",1332374400,2,490,4.279569892473118
