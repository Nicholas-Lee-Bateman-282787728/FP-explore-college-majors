If paying a mainstream movie price, I'd rate it a bit lower. I don't know if this was made for TV back in 1998, but it has that look to it, other than Grieco (If Looks Could Kill, 21 Jump Street, Booker), the actors are people who haven't gone on to anything to be recognisable, even Grieco, hasn't been in anything your likely to have seen since this either.  But the actors all deliver their lines, and tell the story well enough.

It's basically a kidnapping tale where we follow events through Grieco's character Joe.  Joe has relocated to a new city after some reckless driving killed his girlfriend, but he's been successfully sued civilly, and her family isn't letting up in wanting him to pay a substantial amount of money which he doesn't have.  To make matters worse his new workplace is suffering from the death of its founder and the wife who inherited the place doesn't understand how it runs and has started firing people to get profits up, telling the whole workplace that if they don't make more money in the next few months she'll be closing them down.  Juliette, a hot girl who Joe has taken an interest in is one of those fired. Upon learning about Joe's own financial pressure, she suggests they kidnap the widow's son and ask for two million dollars.  Joe has a conscience though, and wants to do as little harm to the boy mentally and physically as possible and is prepared to call the whole thing off if it is not going to plan.  Juliette however isn't prepared to accept failure, and doesn't care what happens to the boy in meeting their goals.

Joe does come across as not just a little naive, but well lacking a lot of common sense.  He does things during the abduction that are the equivalent of the hot girl going into the house when it's obvious the serial killer is upstairs in a horror movie.  If you can come across this for a few dollars though, it's an entertaining enough film to watch.",1448236800,,2063,4.462765957446808

7935129,4,B00005AAEU,"The message in this movie should be clear to any family:  Be careful in choosing your friends.  Although this movie doesn't deal with kids, this movie would be really great for young teens, as their friendships change from their grade school chums to the cliques that start in junior high.  There is a sexual relationship between Joe and Bonnie, and her breasts are seen a couple of times.  Still traditional values parents can use that to point out how their relationship became harder to break up because of that sexual component.  There is little, if any bad language used in the movie.  I won't give away the unexpected ending, but it should give real thought to any teen who is toying with getting involved with someone who doesn't have the same values as the teen does.",1171497600,,775,4.661764705882353
7935130,3,B00005AAEU,"This movie isn't a fantastic one but is not so bad. Wath it if you want to learn about humans emotions in stress case. For the price, I think the DVD worth it...",1054684800,,161,3.909090909090909
7935131,4,B00005AAEU,"If you like to see Richard Grieco in good shape, this is it. The movie itself is entertaining but not really great. Though, you might have seen worse Grieco movies. This one still does ok. It is about an abduction case. Grieco's role and his girlfriend abduct a child - but the male protagonist soon feels remorse.",1050624000,2,314,4.526315789473684
