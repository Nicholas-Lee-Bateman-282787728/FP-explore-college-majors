8465173,4,B001CEESWO,"It's like a flashback episode - not quite a rerun, but close enough.  You get a montage of various Buster clips where they burn, crash, and otherwise mangle their poor crash test dummy, then tie them together with transitions of Jamie and Adam as they reconstruct their co-star (Buster 2.0).  If you haven't seen Mythbusters and want a taste of what they do, this is a good DVD for you!",1264550400,,386,4.5
