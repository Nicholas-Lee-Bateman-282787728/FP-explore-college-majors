7960375,5,B0000640ZU,"I really like this one and so does my 21-month-old. Tigger believes please is a magic word and tries to fly. All his friends make him see that is is a polite word but not magical. It is a great story. I like the story of the flood where Rabbit has to room in with Tigger and learn to get along. 4 wonderful stories that can be viewed over and over again by both the child and the parent, without getting sick of them. A magical wonderful experience and amazing technology of computer art and puppetry. A must have!",1022889600,,514,4.202020202020202
7960376,5,B0000640ZU,"The Book of Pooh is spectacular! And now even better with the addition of Kanga and Roo. Those puppets are so cute! The stories are really good too. The first one Tigger plays a detective in search of a Donkey. He puts clues together and finds Erroye making sanwiches. Really cute. The next one is about Tigger and Roo. Tigger tells a story of tall Tales all about the ""Rooasouras"" These 4 stories seem to be very in depth and have even more computer animation then before, like lakes, rain, etc. Amazingly done and with Kanga and Roo added, as close to perfection as it could get!",1022889600,4,581,4.4392523364485985
