This movie is an excellent drama that breaks some ground in a long dominated Mexican macho world. The acting is superb and the editing was good enough to garner Carlos Savage an award. The story evolves around a cast of four women but the supporting actors are all very solid. This is the story of four woman who's lives are probably all to real. The women are all married to macho men who in one way or another make the womens lives less than tolerable. They rebel and do the unthinkable, abandon their families, including children, for a better life. They leave first for Guadalajara and this is where the movie moves along in their quest for a new life free from the chains of life in a small town with domineering husbands. The adventures they encounter are funny, sad and real. The characters encountered along the way are memorable. The husbands are deemphasized except for one who will ""go to the ends of the earth to find his wife"". The only problem I had was with the how did they manage to get into that situation so quickly syndrome. There is no logical explanation so the viewer has to just go with the story and take the leap, don't question the how and go with the flow. This makes for some unexplainable far fetched gaps but otherwise it is a story that is told with realism.  Mexican cinema should be applauded for it's tackling a subject matter so controversial. This is a culture steeped deep in macho dominance. Men often leave their families, often more than one, all in the name of seeking a better future. The fact that women are portrayed as doing this is innovative and suggestive that the times are indeed changing. The story serves two purposes , it illustrates there is a way out and that the comraderie that exists between women is not so different than that from males. This is pretty good story telling about a subject that is uncommon, women just don't desert their children usually. A pretty good drama, very close to 5 stars, worth seeing, especially for those inclined towards Mexican themes.",980121600,4,2163,4.574742268041237
