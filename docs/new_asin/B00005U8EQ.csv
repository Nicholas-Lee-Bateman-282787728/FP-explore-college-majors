Enjoy.",1067040000,,128,4.7727272727272725
1664472,5,B00005U8EQ,"I got to see this film in the fantasy film festival, that took place in Berlin this year. This film has a ""Psycho"" feeling to it, with all the camera shots, dialogue types. This is very evident at the very beginning. We're in a country kitchen in the middle of nowhere, it's almost eight o'clock, and there is absolutely nobody except for this young and attractive waitress. But, the tension climbs high up just five seconds later, as a mysterious young man enters the eatery. And, indeed, the whole story is about the mystery of this man, who claims himself to be hiding from his friends. The storyboard is quite interesting, in addition to having a known feeling to it, as a thriller-fan would sense it immediately. Yet it is good.
The direction is meticulously done. Juxtapositions in tension scenes are indeed excitement-stressing, such as the young man's dealing with his wound in the most ungentle fashion and the coffee droplets dripping from the coffee machine, making a 'bizzzz' on the metal surface.
Blood, which is a part of most thriller films, is well used. It's not excesive; it's minimally used, yet very efficiently. I think it""s the fear on the victims that thrill us more, and not the blood.
The end is very interesting. I mean not the end of the story, but the end of the film... I will not tell you, because you really have to see it. I highly recommend this movie.",1063324800,,1385,4.634146341463414
1664473,4,B00005U8EQ,"This made-on-a-shoestring film delivers a wallop. I went in with no expectations and was instantly drawn into the compelling opening scenes, and the razor sharp acting by the young cast.
The movie opens with Beth (Radha Mitchell) striding purposefully down a dusty highway. She is furious when a car speeds past her leaving her in a cloud of dust without offering her a ride. She arrives at a surprising spacious, super hygienic diner that she opens for business.  Imaginative quick shots follow of her filling the condiment containers, starting the coffee, turning on the lights highlighting the boredom and repetitiousness of her life.  Enter the driver of the car who passed her by, Jack (Barry Wilson) greasy haired, frail, shaky and obviously broke and hungry. Beth warily jokes with him and feels empathy toward this polite young man; she has obviously had troubles of her own.  Jack claims that three surfers are after him, trying to kill him.  He clearly is frightened and has a serious wound in his side. While he is telling his story, the ""surfers"" drive up. In a panic, he draws a knife and hides.  The three, led by Daniel (Josh Lucas, the only actor I recognized: ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" ""Hulk"") said they were on their way to the nearby beach.  Daniel in particular was charming, funny and sweet.  They admitted they were looking for a drifter who they claimed had broken into their car and robbed them. That's the setup, and Beth (and the viewer) spend two-thirds of the movie trying to figure out who to believe. Violence, terror, and things that-go-bump-in-the-night escalate until the tension is unbearable.
The pacing is relentless and for me, the movie went by in a flash.  Excellent directing by Scott Reynolds who I understand has made other fine, quirky, low budget films. ""When Strangers Appear"" doesn't answer all your questions.  It never tells you exactly what, if anything, was stolen or whether the drifter or the surfers might be disguised agents of some government, maybe our own.  I do not consider this a flaw.  It was just one more thing to ponder over. A minor annoyance was the ""Oregon"" locale. The movie was shot in some Commonwealth country; the road and informational signs were a dead giveaway.  The lack of extras (probably a budget consideration) was a plus; it focused the intensity on the main players and heightened the sense of alienation.
""When Strangers Appear"" is excellent entertainment.  I recommend buying it for your home library if you are not adverse to a scare or two or three.

1664474,5,B00005U8EQ,"To the reveiwer from Canada. Thanks for the revelation that the movie was filmed in New Zealand. I was wondering why the cop's squad car and wife's SUV had the same license plate, supposedly Oregon VLP-077.
Edge of your seat thriller. Josh Lucas is awesomely manipulative in this film. Radha plays a tough waitress/restaurant owner trying to shake off an unpleasant past, and perhaps her addiction to cigarrettes.",1055721600,,413,5.088235294117647
1664475,4,B00005U8EQ,"When Strangers Appear, is the kind of movie that can suck you in, and take you along for a suspenseful, and unpredictable journey.  Written and directed by Scott Reynolds, the film is an Australian production, set in of all places, Oregon.  The plot unfolds, taking twists and turns, designed to keep you guessing.  The film features no big stars, but contains solid performances by the entire cast.  Ultimately how much you may enjoy it, may depend on your tolerance for ambiguity.  If you need to have total clarity and resolution, you may not be satisfied with the ending.  Saying too much, about exactly what happens, would ruin it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but here are some peripheral comments.
Radha Mitchell, is an actress with talent.  She was great in ...Pitch Black..., and also plays a strong woman here.  Her performance is believable, and rings true throughout.  No cheap laughs, or throwaway lines.  Her character ""Beth"", is busy running two businesses.  By day, a tiny dinner, and at night, she manages a motel.  Barry Watson, gives an edgy performance as a furtive and suspicious drifter who shows up at the diner, claiming that people are after him.  Josh Lucas plays a helpful ""surfer"", one who's concerned about Beth.  And Kevin Anderson plays the local lawman, a guy who apparently has problems controlling himself around women, especially Beth.
When Strangers Appear, is an interesting film, with some quirky choices in editing.  It starts a bit slow, but the level of violence escalates, at times quite surprisingly.  The plot twists keep you guessing, and in the end, you don't know exactly what it was all for.  There are some major problems with time sequencing during a standoff scene at the diner, where it goes from noon to dusk in just a few minutes.  Also, cars seem to suddenly and silently, appear out of nowhere, a bit too often.  The foreign locales could pass for Oregon, unless perhaps you're an expert on trees of the Pacific Northwest.  A couple of minor characters, do seem to have a hint of Aussie type accents.  The post end credit ""post script"" doesn't add anything.  Though far from perfect, it is still a thriller well worth your time.  Radha Mitchell continues to show that she is an actress with much potential.
The DVD contains both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie.  The extras are minimal, and the subtitling is not true to the actual dialog.",1030924800,4,2425,4.8019323671497585
1664476,5,B00005U8EQ,"Caught this movie late one night on the Mystery channel and became quickly enthralled. Although I knew I had to get some sleep before work the next day, I HAD to see how everything turned out. And even though I had pretty much guessed how it was going to end, the plot twists still kept me second guessing. With a cast that includes Radha Mitchell and Josh Lucas, who in my opinion is one of the most talented actors of his generation, the acting was truly first class.
Some viewers seem to have a lukewarm reaction to the somewhat over-the-top ending, but don't let that keep you from experiencing the rest of the movie!  Similarly, it is true that everything is not fully explained in the end, but I think that's part of the point.  To me, the movie is about what Radha Mitchell's character experiences rather than why she experiences it.  In the end, we know only what she knows, so in a way, we've truly gone through what she has, which is refreshing if you ask me.
If you like well-acted, nicely directed and craftfully plotted suspense thrillers, this movie is for you!",1014940800,4,1075,4.5025641025641026
1664504,2,B00005U8EQ,"Just finished watching this on Showtime. I'm not into the 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Dust to Dawn' Tarantino-ish kind of action films and this sort of fits in that genre.  The thing that really 'bugged' the hell out of me was the narrative of the story.
There were these 'gaps' and I mean, freakin' giant 'gaps' throughout the film that made the flow seem 'episodic' and terribly paced.  It's like 'commercials' should of been placed where the story suddenly fades,or jumps to a new scene, oddly zapping the main characters into a totally new situation. You literally have to 'connect the dots' with quick flashbacks, or listen to the characters explain 'what the hell' just happened.
Of course, or at least I hope (!),that this was the intention that the director, and editor wanted. You know,to 'self indulge' themselves, trying to make the movie more cryptic and way kooler than it actually is.
I thought this style really worked in the teen, pulp-fiction like comedy ""Go"" but in this,for me, it just didn't need it. It's a simple little thriller that has it's heart in the right place, but is dressed up with too many 'flashbacks' and 'plot twists'.
Spunky waitress meets a dangerous (or is he?) fugitive, befriends a good-looking, friendly (or is he?) drifter with two loser buddies and later teams up with the town sheriff (who's also a rapist! Huh?)in a subplot that goes nowhere.
Now I will admit,that the film does look incredibly gorgeous and has a 'feverish' sunny kind of hypontic appeal and Josh Lucas looks stunning. His blue eyes, and dashing mysterious charm is worth the peek alone, and there's a scene at the very end, (after the climactic showdown, and 'only in the movies' kind of explosion of an old road side gas station) with lead actress Radha Mitchell that is pretty darn cute. But in a Tarantino...ain't this movie soooo kool....kinda way. That's just my opinion! Kevin Brian",1288915200,,1893,4.821538461538461

1664506,5,B00005U8EQ,"When Strangers Appear:

 I agree with Tarantino (one of the Amazon reviewers, also most of the other reviewers.  This is a great little thriller from start to finish.  If that is what you are looking for, this DVD is for you!
 However if you are a gay guy (like me) and looking to see a lot more of Barry Wilson (who plays Jack) look somewhere else. ...Barry's acting is no problem.  He does a great job.  But, that is where it stops!
 Barry is a good looking guy, however, this film does not show him off and Barry keeps his shirt on.  O well!  So, if you're looking to see a lot more of Barry Wilson it does not happen on this DVD.
 But When Strangers Appear:  is a great ride.

1664507,4,B00005U8EQ,"""When Strangers Appear"" (2001) is just the sort of film I'm a sucker for.  It's a tense, neo-Hitchcockian thriller with a crisp, clean visual style, a forceful sense of place, several great suspense sequences, very effective camera work, and one hell of a paranoid mood.  The story concerns a young woman who for 48 hours becomes entangled in a mysterious manhunt when her path crosses with the wrong people on the Oregon coast.  Or, as I really like to tell folks, it's about a waitress being chased by diabolical surfers.

The film was written and directed by New Zealand director Scott Reynolds.  For me his first film, ""The Ugly,"" was close to unwatchable, but then he released ""Heaven,"" which showed a lot of promise.  (And with any luck he'll break his 6-year dry spell and bring us something else soon.)  Radha Mitchell and Josh Lucas are both very, very good in ""When Strangers Appear,"" as is Kevin Anderson in his supporting role.  The film has a few flaws, however.  This includes a few too-self-conscious moments and the casting of Barry Watson as Jack, the man on the run.  Still, the film is a must-see for fans of tense contemporary thrillers that lie in the shadow of Hitch, or for anyone who's up for the sort of gripping, old-fashioned good time provided by films like ""Red Rock West,"" ""Nick of Time,"" and ""Breakdown.""",1178323200,,1335,4.7155172413793105
1664508,4,B00005U8EQ,"This one keeps you guessing about everyone except Beth (Radha Mitchell).  Even when pieces to this ingenious plot start fitting together, there are still more surprises.  Great cinematography and features like the cafe, and the gas station are almost characters themselves the way the camera frames them and then slowly brings the viewer into the scene.  When it was over I kept thinking Quentin Tarantino would somehow appear in the credits as ""Inspired by...""  or  ""Taken from an idea by..."".  Loved it and am happy to add it to my collection.",1177718400,,545,4.934065934065934
1664509,3,B00005U8EQ,"Why are movies still being made with ""they want this disc"" as the central plot? Josh Lucas is the only reason anyone should watch this movie.",1160352000,,141,4.461538461538462
1664510,5,B00005U8EQ,"This is the latest(that i know of) film from one of my favorite new directors, Scott Reynolds, who hails from New Zealand. WHEN STRANGERS APPEAR is his best film yet, and that is saying something, because I think his other 2 films are pretty good too. The plot in this one always keeps you guessing. The whole style of the film serves to keep you off-balance and it works wonderfully; i haven't been this engaged by a film in a long time; I really wanted to know what was going on...and I was not disappointed at all in the way this film wraps things up. It has a trio of excellent performances from 3 up and coming actors: the radiantly tough Radha Mitchell, the awesome (as always) Josh Lucas and (after escaping the purgatory of 7TH HEAVEN) Barry Watson; all perform very capably and help sell this films many pleasures. Highly Recommended for lovers of tightly wound suspense thrillers. I think that is what i found so refreshing about WHEN STRANGERS APPEAR. It is the  simply THE tightest thriller to come down the pike since THE HITCHER and it avoids even the pitfalls that that film made; WHEN STRANGERS APPEAR really is a prefect little thriller.",1148169600,,1154,4.601941747572815
1664511,1,B00005U8EQ,"This movie was a piece of crap!  I've never seen a more poorly thought out movie.  It had NOTHING good in it whatsoever.

Glitches in the movie--Why was there only one sheriff?  Even in small towns, there's usually a sheriff and a deputy.

Why would the police officer just stop the car in the middle of the road to talk?  People can talk while driving...DUH!

On foot, Beth never would have escaped from those crooks.

Also, why didn't they show us what was on the disk?  After making us endure a terrible movie, they should have at least shown us what was on the disk.

The movie had a poorly thought-out ending.

The movie was gory.  It's so revolting how those three guys were able to get away with killing a lot of people for so long.

This movie was a waste of film.  At least I saw it for free.

Don't even waste your money on renting this.  It is a waste of two hours of my life that I can never get back.",1140393600,5,913,4.131428571428572
1664512,3,B00005U8EQ,"Watching this film is not a difficult thing.  Theres enough going for it that it will hold your interest.  With likable charactors like Beth (Mitchell) that overshadow that annoying charactors like Jack (Watson) you are bound to enjoy most of the film.  My only pet peves are that most of the plot, and even the sub-plots, are never fully explored.  When Jack arrives at Beths diner he's worn out, bleeding and frightened.  When Peter (Lucas) arrives looking for Jack he's the complete opposite.  He's clean and calm.  Beth is confused.  Is this Jack guy crazy or rightfully and justifiably on the run.  And then there's Brice, the cop who raped Beth and his crazy wife who harrases Beth constantly.  And there's the doctor Eric who Beth asks to help Jack.  Theres problems with all of this.  They never really explain what really happened between Beth and Brice, they never tell you why Eric and Beth are so close (Beth says somthing about Eric being there for her when no one else was...what in the hell is she talking about???) and the biggest problem is that while they explain that Peter and his buddies are after a disc that Jack has they never explain what is on the disc...I mean, what do three slacker surfing bums want with a disc.  I think the writer couldn't come up with a good enough ending or even a plot and so he said, lets end it with some eplosions and $hit and then we won't have to explain anything...What saves this movie it the acting.  I think that Rahha Mitchell is an excilent actress (See Melinda and Melinda) and Josh Lucas always possesses that cool and colected air about him.  Barry Watson has never impressed me and he just upset me in this movie.  His charactor was so unstable and jumpy that it was unrealistic.  Expecially the scene in the diner when Peter and his friends enter for the first time.  Jack is behind the counter with Beth and he;s telling her how these guys want to kill him and he doesnt want her to say anything but he;s so loud and pretty much in plain sight...it's just rediculous.  All in all, it;s not terrible but its not great either...",1140393600,,2094,4.5212765957446805
1664513,4,B00005U8EQ,"Well, we have to be biased because we live in the area (Foxton Beach) where this tight little thriller was filmed back in April - June 2000.  We rented the DVD a couple of years back because, like a lot of people, its a buzz to see your home town and surrounding area serving as backdrop to a movie.  You want to see if you can match and/or recognise specific locations etc.

The movie itself was a delightful surprise.  Not only did it showcase the wide open landscape and countryside of the ""Horowhenua/Manawatu"" area of lower west coast, North Island, New Zealand, it also provided us with an hour and a half of great entertainment.

The main cast all did an excellent job with their characters, especially Barry Watson with his edgy and paranoid persona in the character of 'Jack Barrett'.  His talent is in the range of emotions he showed.  The expressions and looks that he projected were spot-on and believable.  Very impressive considering this was his 2nd movie ever and first outside of the USA.  Nothing like his 'Matt Camden' role on 7th Heaven and clearly his best dramatic work so far in our opinion.

Radha Mitchell held our interest and sympathy in her character as 'Beth'.  Only a couple of slip-ups with the accent (she is an Australian) blemished her strong acting ability.  Josh Lucas, who took the part of the nice-but-not-so-nice surfer 'Peter', was attractive in a (later) menacing way.  'Blue eyes' are not always kind eyes...

The minimum number of 8 cast together with the isolation and wide open spaces of the area in which it was filmed, easily added to the whole atmosphere of uncertainty ,tension and mistrust.

""When Strangers Appear"" turns out to be a sleeper of a movie, which should have been given more promotion on original release.  Well worth an hour and a half of your time;  a great ride.  Recommended.  The only 'niggle' we have with it, is that we would have liked more information about the importance of that 'disc', and that some of the action which supposedly happened off-camera, should have been shown on-camera.  And Scott Reynolds - thank you for bringing your project to Foxton !",1116720000,,2130,4.720867208672087

7954338,5,B00005U8EQ,"Keeps your attention with a quick pace and suspense. A young woman is in constant danger. You are guessing at first, which one is the bad guy, and which is the good-guy. Once you know which is the bad guy; then it is whether she will survive against the odds. Creativity on the part of the bad-guy and the intended victim on several occasions.

Takes place in a very small farming town in the middle of nowhere. The town sheriff is more interested in sleeping around than in doing his job. The young woman runs a cafe and motel. She is unarmed, and unsure what is going on between some visitors passing through; but, finds herself forced into the middle of things whether she wants to or not.
