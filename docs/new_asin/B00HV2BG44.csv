6228706,5,B00HV2BG44,"I discovered this six episode Swedish series on the International MHZ TV channel [...] and loved it! The episodes are set in the 1950's and surround three main characters Puck and Eje (an engaged and later a newly married couple) and Christer, Eje's best friend and a police superintendent. Each episode finds the trio in yet another serious murder mystery in a Swedish setting with an array of interesting suspects. I love how the trio interact where Puck (the female of the trio) has a highly sensitive compatibility with Christer and often use their combined intelligence to solve the mystery. Eje, sometimes feeling like an outsider, has different strengths that work separately, yet compatibly at dire times. All together they are heroes. It's particularly fun to see a Swedish 1950's home & decor, along with the fashions and cars and foods. Anyone who enjoys historical settings will enjoy seeing this period drama both for it's excellent acting and writing as well as lovely settings. For detailed series information see the Wikipedia write up at [...] Enjoy!",1399507200,11,1067,5.068181818181818
6228707,4,B00HV2BG44,"The drama in Crimes of Passion is more in the relationships than in the crimes. Interesting relationships are part of its success. Count on being entertained.

Police Commissioner Christer ( Ola Repace) and University academic Einar (Linus Wahlgren) are childhood friends. Both men are attracted to Puck, (Tuva Novotny) whose attraction to Einar is stronger. Christer yields to his friend. Puck and Einar seem to be where murders happen, which is contrived but acceptable. Puck, who eventually writes a crime novel, provides invaluable help in unraveling the tangled relationships of those involved in murders. Puck is socially adroit, good looking, and very observant and curious.

Forgive my personal rant, but what I didn't like was how nearly all the characters smoked continuously. Set in the 50s, smoking fit the time and the people, but it seemed over emphasized to me. I'd prefer to see less smoking in movies. Showing characters smoking, especially likable characters, encourages a habit that is harmful and costly to society.",1398729600,2,1035,5.304878048780488

6228709,5,B00HV2BG44,"This is the type of series I really enjoy. I love the scenery and the fashions and of course the story lines. I like to watch them even with
English  captions and still enjoy them very much. The actors are just great",1398211200,3,216,4.142857142857143
6228710,5,B00HV2BG44,"Have watched the first three of the six in this series and have enjoyed them all.  I'm guessing that it is set in the 50s (floral dresses, capri pants and angora sweaters for the women, brown suits,hats, cravats and bow ties for the men) and the series has a lovely nostalgic feel to it. If you are a fan of Poirot and Miss Marple I feel sure you will enjoy Crimes of Passion too.",1395619200,2,380,4.135135135135135
6228711,5,B00HV2BG44,Love this series. I first watched one how on MhZ Network and had to purchase the series. Naturally my old pal Amazon Carried it so I purchased the set.  Bobbi K.,1395273600,,161,4.193548387096774
6228712,5,B00HV2BG44,Really love this series...it's beautifully shot and the characters are interesting.  The plots are not outstanding but they are still really solid.  Much better than most of the stuff on American TV.,1393200000,11,199,5.1875
6228713,4,B00HV2BG44,love the vintageness of it all and the way the colors were made to pop out really bright in certain places. Has a humphrey bogart/jack webb old school feel to it. The haunting plots Really makes you think about everything long after the show is through.favorite episode was the college kids that rented a cabin. Lead character is especially great and reminds me eerily of the girl who played lisbeth salander.,1392595200,5,409,4.774647887323944

6228715,5,B00HV2BG44,"Absolutely loved this series for the quirky characters, the stylistic settings, the spectacular photography, with elements of Twin Peaks and Christie. After depressing and miserable Reality tv this was a 'take it with a pinch of salt' fresh air.

6228717,5,B00HV2BG44,"The first in the series may seem like a pale derivative of Christie--as one of the suspects even voices-- but they do get much better as Lang understands her main characters better and they gain depth. The playing and the setting is a delight, reminiscent of the Joan Hickson Marples.",1410652800,,284,4.7
6228718,5,B00HV2BG44,Thoroughly enjoyable series.  I hope there will be lots more.  The acting is good and I love the retro feel of Sweden in the 1950s  Highly recommended....,1410220800,,154,4.62962962962963
6228719,5,B00HV2BG44,"Another winner from the non-profit distributor and TV broadcaster MHz Networks.

One of the finest of the recent TV imports from Scandinavia, this Swedish murder mystery is set in the 1950s and centers on a fascinating triumvirate of characters led by a headstrong young woman, Puck Ekstedt (Tuva Novotny), a doctoral candidate in European literature specializing in crime fiction -- and rather obsessed with the topic-- who finds she has a knack for solving real crimes.

Her paramour Eje (Linus Wahlgren) also is an academic but his passion begins and ends with medieval church art, so when Puck goes detectin' he usually takes a back seat, offering her support and acting as a soundboard. Puck does have a crime-solving partner though, Eje's his BFF Christer (""Wallander"" costar Ola Rapace),  a rising star in the Stockholm police department.

In fact it's though Christer that Puck begins applying her brains to detective work when he shows up to solve a murder at a weekend party at Puck's professor's house.

Christer is a lady's man -- actually a bit of a dog -- and he has great chemistry with Puck which creates interesting tension in the men's friendship.

The series -- six feature-length mysteries -- is based on the novels by Maria Lang. I'm unfamiliar with her work. As for the show, it is wonderfully written, he relationships are beautifully drawn, the acting is superb, the locations breathtaking, and the mysteries scrumptious.",1404950400,8,1445,5.02510460251046

6228721,5,B00HV2BG44,"Well acted and good stories.  The post war era is well catered for, and always terrific Scandanavian scenery. Enjoyed the six episodes immensely.",1402099200,,145,5.304347826086956
6228722,5,B00HV2BG44,"Like her Shakespearean namesake we meet Puck during a Midsummer Night party. She is indeed spritely and engaging, as is this stylish mystery series set in Sweden in the 1950's. As others have noted, these stories fall more into the ""cozy"" category rather than the ""dark"" fare that much of Scandi mystery is currently. However, this is no ""Miss Marple"" -- these stories crackle with romantic and sexual tension and psychological motives. The name says it all: these are crimes centered around passion! Ola Rapace plays Puck's male counterpart although she is
married to someone else, and it is fun to watch what happens between them. Ola gives Don Draper a run for his money in his suave period suits and skirt chasing. The acting, the stories and the sets in ""Crimes of Passion"" are all excellent and, in my opinion, the show is smart and delightful viewing.",1401235200,9,858,4.804054054054054
6228723,2,B00HV2BG44,"Those of us who particularly enjoy crime stories, police procedurals and the like properly feel indebted to Scandinavia for the many fine programs produced in recent years.  But Crimes of Passion presents proof, if any was needed, that no one's perfect.  The two episodes I watched were superficial and unoriginal in story content, poorly directed and edited, and featured characters without depth and with whom one really couldn't engage (not surprising given the thinness of the material).  My view might possibly have changed had I gone beyond the first two episodes but, alas, I could not.",1400544000,4,593,5.15625
8636222,3,B00HV2BG44,Bit childish and far-fetched but then we're terribly spoiled by some great English crime/drams/police mysteries.  Changed it from a 2 to a 3 - the last three episodes were quite good & redeemed themselves!,1497398400,,205,5.029411764705882

8636228,5,B00HV2BG44,The first episode is OK because they are just introducing the characters.  Then it gets really good.  It's well shot.  Sweden looks gorgeous.  The acting is excellent.  The music is worthy too.  Hope they make more.,1427328000,,215,4.833333333333333
8636229,5,B00HV2BG44,"We received this from a friend in Budapest who bought it for herself and didn't realize it was formatted for US and Canada. We thought it was great and were disappointed there are no more available. The obvious attraction between Christer and Puck was an added feature to the stories, but wasn't to be. One surprise was that I think Christer was driving an early 1950s Kaiser automobile.",1418256000,,387,4.705882352941177
