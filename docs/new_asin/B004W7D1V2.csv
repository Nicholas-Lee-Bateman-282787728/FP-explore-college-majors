4485729,4,B004W7D1V2,"IMHO this is an important document in the Sade catalog given the time-frame, Oct 1984, and the set list, some of which was likely never played live again after this tour, namely ""Sally"", ""I Will be Your Friend"", and ""Love Affair with Life"", this last track being non-LP.  The video is a bit grainy, certainly not up to quality of any of her other DVD's, but hardly bootleg either. I'm guessing it was recorded at a large club in Munich for a TV special possibly.  Amazing to see how young all three of her ""regulars"" look:  Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and especially Paul Denman on bass....he looks like a teenager almost!  While they've all changed quite a lot in the 28 years since this show was recorded, today she barely looks like she's aged more than a handful of years from the 25-year old goddess who appears here.  Amazing.

The band does not include a regular guitarist, and Stuart only plays guitar on a couple tracks.  He spends the rest of his time on sax doing what he does best.  Ignore the negative reviews....if you love her music, this is a must-have.",1346025600,9,1073,4.552083333333333
4485730,5,B004W7D1V2,I have other Sade dvds and have enjoyed them all.  I ordered this to watch during a surgery recovery and was easy to watch over and over. Would definately reccomend.,1330905600,,165,4.5
4485731,1,B004W7D1V2,"Sade is an extremely talented artist. And the musicians that she works with also are very talented. Unfortunately, the people who produced this DVD are not. And it should be noted that production of this DVD was not authorized by Sade or her management staff. The clarity of the video is very off. The audio is poor. Captions and titles look like something from an amature's basement. The aspect ratio is set improperly in the DVD. So, the 4:3 picture often defaults to 16:9 on modern DVD players, causing the typical stretched out face and body problem.

It is very sad to say, but Sade also did not have a good performance in this show. She hit many notes off key and often seemed distracted. All musicians have off days. One thing they do not do is sell recordings of those performances. That is unfair to fans. This was a show she was not happy enough with the release an official video of.

This DVD definitely should be avoided. You should look at any of her other official releases to get something worth purchasing.",1329436800,18,1023,4.554347826086956

Please be aware that this recording is actually an illegal bootleg and hasn't been approved by Sade or Sony. Any copies available on retail sites are not official and have not been authorised for sale. Any further posts on the forum relating to the recording will be removed - we hope you can appreciate the reasons for this. Admin",1316476800,6,762,4.547445255474453
4485735,3,B004W7D1V2,"As a great admirer of Sade I was very disappointed to get this DVD and find out that it is from a 1984 Munich concert.  Additionally there are only nine songs from, what could be best described as a lackluster show.  The entire DVD is 47 minutes and not even any extra material.  What a rip off.  I blame myself as there was no previous reviews and I jumped based on the assumption that it was a concert of newly released material from their Soldier of Love album. Their other DVDs are very good, high quality video and sound.  This DVD is not very good in either category. Buyer beware, this DVD is only acceptable if you want an early and short version of a Sade concert.",1277078400,44,673,4.267716535433071

4485743,5,B004W7D1V2,"Ever since I discovered a cassette tape copy of Rainbow On Stage in 1997 or 1998 when I was in my early teens I have been in love with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow.  My wife bought me this DVD for my birthday and it's one of the best presents I've ever received!

If you are a fan of the original Ronnie James Dio and Blackmore pairing on vocals and guitars and you love live concert DVDs then you owe it to yourself to pick this up!  The singing and the playing are equal parts spellbinding and jaw dropping.  Until I started listening to live recordings of Rainbow I never really appreciated what an amazing guitar player Blackmore really is.  His playing on Mistreated and Catch the Rainbow is simply the best that I have ever heard and seen.  And that's to say nothing about how amazing Dio's vocals are!  I had the pleasure of seeing Dio perform with Black Sabbath in 2008 and he was utterly amazing then but back in 1977 at his vocal peak there is just no comparing any other singer to Ronnie James Dio.

The set-list features all of the concert classics including the aforementioned Mistreated and Catch the Rainbow along with Kill the King, Man on the Silver Mountain and 16th Century Greensleeves.  I was a little disappointed that Stargazer was not included but honestly, the playing on the other songs is so phenomenal that I didn't even miss Stargazer.  Also, after listening to the 3 live albums from their 1976 shows in Germany, Stargazer didn't come off quite as good live as it did in the studio.

The line-up of the band features the Dio, Blackmore, Powell axis with Bob Daisley (later of Ozzy Osbourne) on bass and David Stone on keyboards.  Honestly, I prefer Tony Carey on keys over David Stone.  But by no means is Stone a detriment to this concert.  And as much as I love Jimmy Bain on bass there really was no drop off with Daisley.  Cozy Powell is simply amazing on drums, one of, if not, the most underrated drummers in rock history in my opinion.

All in all, I was completely blown away by this DVD, the sound quality is top notch and the video really isn't that bad considering it's from 1977.  If you love Rainbow, Ronnie James Dio, and/or Ritchie Blackmore then this DVD is for you!!!",1421020800,3,2213,4.478802992518704
4485744,5,B004W7D1V2,Excellent performance! Can hear clearly the beginning of Power Metal within the speed and musical elements with Dio being a very powerful vocalist! Blackmore delivered a great show! The band lineup was very epic!!,1420329600,,213,5.294117647058823

4485755,3,B004W7D1V2,"First off I'm a big fan of the Rainbow Rising and Long Live Rock n' Roll albums, but this live show just falls short.  It just can't be overlooked that Ritchie Blackmore extends too many of the songs past the point of boredom, and the set list could have been better.  Also, Ritchie acts like a total maniac at the end of the show, and not in a good way.  After four plus minutes of him smashing his guitar while still plugged in and blaring noise for what seems like forever I feel comfortable in saying yes, this should have been better.",1403481600,4,539,4.264705882352941

4485759,5,B004W7D1V2,"There's not a lot of information on Amazon or the web in general about this new edition of Rainbow's Live In Munich DVD, so I thought I'd provide some.  The ONLY difference between the original 2006 release and this new 2013 version is the addition of the 11-minute original '76 special (for US TV?) ""Rainbow Over Texas '76"".  This is an EXTREMELY welcome addition, as the special, as grainy as it may be, has bits of footage of Rainbow performing ""Stargazer"", and, this is the big one, ""A Light in the Black""!!!  Wow! Almost certainly the only surviving video footage of those songs being played live.  The special also has some exclusive interviews with Ritchie and Ronnie.  All in all,  it's definitely worth seeking out the newer version over the original if you're buying it for the first time, and if you already have the original one, well, you have to ask yourself, how big of a Rainbow fan am I? For me, for 10 bucks it was a no-brainer, and I'm really glad I got the new one.  The DVD otherwise retains all the other amazing stuff that was on the original edition, the mindblowing show obviously, but also the epic promo videos, including ""Gates of Babylon"" (with Ronnie's INCREDIBLE live vocal over the original studio-recorded instrumental backing), the very nice interviews with Bob Daisley and Colin Hart, and the 30-minute slide show with an excellent commentary summarizing the early history of the band.

I mean guys she performs her butts off ... WoooWee !!!  Oh and the band is totally top notch in the 1994 Live dvd ... now in this Munich concert it's like night and day ... the band in the Munich concert is rather DuLL and I said DuLL...they don't seem to have any showmanship like her band in the 1994 show which moved and grooved ... even her performance is rather DuLL in the Munich concert ... she seems almost timid most of the time on stage ... hands down this Munich concert can't even come close to the caliber of performance in the 1994 Live concert.",1516579200,,939,4.544378698224852

8444673,5,B004W7D1V2,"This is the best DVD from this era regarding the Dio years. Rainbow fans claim that they were the worlds best rock band from 1976 to 1979.  As one reviewer has already stated the 35 minute documentary titled - Slide Show with Audio Commentary is worth watching alone. This DVD also has the best documentaries on Rainbow. If you are a fan of Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin then this is a MUST WATCH DVD !

1977 - 78 - A strange era for rock and especially hard rock bands. The young UK punks called any band that had been around since 1970 as dinosaurs. Rainbow blow the punks away with one song  Kill the King.  In the US, it is KISS who came out on top in '77 and to be fair they had a great live show. Fleetwood Mac released their epic Rumours. Rumours brought in a new era of softer melodic sounds with the emphasis on rhythm guitar, which would affect Zeppelin and Rainbow. Bands like Boston, Styx and Foreigner would adopt the soft melodic tones and also include hard rock.

Rainbow was up against it.  Ritchie Blackmore and the best Rainbow line up which included Cozy Powell on drums, Bob Daisley on bass, the brilliant David Stone on keyboards and of course Ronnie James  Dio on vocals. However, I believe that this is the best ever Rainbow line up and they pull of something special.

Rainbow - Live in Munich 1977 is not only a must have for Rainbow fans, BUT, for all fans of rock, hard rock and 70's guitar rock. This DVD is interesting as it captures Rainbow at their best, and arguably, many parochial fans of both Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow cite them as THE best rock band in the world. A sweeping statement as Led Zeppelin had toured in '77 and rock journalists Stephen Davis and Mick Wall refer to Zeppelin's tour as disastrous. In '77 the Rolling Stones were busy producing their Some Girls album which would be surprisingly a well selling album. If you want to see absolute pathetic, simply watch the Some Girls DVD which captures the Rolling Stones, in my humble opinion at a complete lack lustre concert in Texas 1978. One can now see why Rainbow was considered the best rock band, definitely hard rock band in the world from 1976 - 1979.

The songs from the DVD -
Into and Kill the King - a fast, almost punk opening to get both the band and the crowd going. Kill the King worked and it finally appeared on my favourite album Long Live Rock and Roll.

Mistreated - my favourite Deep Purple - Mark III song. Dio does great versions of Mistreated, and yes, hard core fans of Rainbow tell me that the '76 versions of Mistreated are better than the one in Munich '77. This is not the case this is a great version as Ritchie keep this version under 10 minutes.

16th Century Green sleeves and Catch the Rainbow - one of Deep Purple's major strengths that carried on into rainbow was they had great set lists. Unlike Zeppelin and especially the Stones who had no idea, the Rainbow songs flowed into each other. Both 16th Century Greensleeves and Catch the Rainbow begin with soft mellow solos. 16th Century Greensleeves becomes a great hard rocker and catch the Rainbow is a brilliant show piece for Blackmore's talents as a blues player.

Long Live Rock and Roll - a favourite of mine and another great song. The Munich concert was taped on the 9th October and fans had to wait another six months for the album released in April 1978.

Man on the Silver Mountain - this is the DVD where I discovered that this was John Bonham's favourite Rainbow song. You have to listen to this version as it has parts of Starstruck and then segues into Night People. This arrangement illustrates that Blackmore has chosen great musicians who could improvise brilliantly. You have to listen to THIS VERSION of Man on the Silver Mountain. Yes, there are faster and harder versions of Man on the Silver Mountain. BUT the inclusion of Night People and Blackmore's brilliant solos and blues playing is phenomenal.
Still I'm Sad - following on from Man on the Silver Mountain another guitar gem. Many fans have observed that Ritchie's guitar parts are so soft at times they are almost inaudible. This long version of Still I'm Sad is great and again, the band come together and with the keyboard playing and drumming by Cozy Powell is amazing.
NOTE - the brilliant Stargazer is missing from this DVD which left a bad taste in my mouth and that is why many parochial Rainbow fans consider the 1976 German Cologne show superior to this DVD. However, in terms of musical ability and improvisation, Still I'm Sad is a gem.

Do You Close Your Eyes - following the lengthy Still I'm Sad and following the style of the opener, Kill the King.... do You Close Your Eyes finishes of the night. It is allegedly about 2 pm. Do You Close Your Eyes highlights the best and the worst of Rainbow. In an amusing moment Dio sings the last verse but is inaudible, as he is singing on the wrong microphone. Furthermore, Blackmore is playing a solo on a different, all black Stratocaster which smashes.  I think this is really stupid, as is a close up of his guitar effects ensemble as it destroys the mystique.

SPECIAL FEATURES  the two documentaries -
1  Bob Daisley
II  Rainbow Over Texas 76 / Photo Gallery / Slide Show with Audio Commentary- are mandatory for not only fans of Rainbow, but Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. The narrator outlines that by 1977 Rainbows live, on stage improvisations were superior to Zeppelins.

LISTENING  Many Rainbow fans claim that Rainbow: Live on Stage (1976) is far superior to the Munich concert. This is not the case. I urge all fans of rock to actually listen to the songs. As it is a DVD you can clearly watch Ritchie Blackmore play.  It always brings a smile to my face when hard core Rainbow fans assert that Rainbow was the best band in the world from 1976 to 1979. This DVD goes a long way to proving that.

5 STARS for an amazing DVD. Once again, the SPECIAL FEATURES alone are worth watching. The DVD captures the brilliance of Ritchie Blackmore in great detail at the time and his blues playing which you will not see in any Deep Purple video. In forums around the world, Rainbow fans claim that they were the worlds best rock band from 1976 to 1979. Watch this DVD and you will see why.",1474243200,,6211,4.491570541259982
