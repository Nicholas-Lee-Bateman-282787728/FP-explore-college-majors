4844940,5,B005N95QUM,"I heard this show was a good watch on a spill.com review, so I checked it out and after watching the series I fell in love with it. Filled with Young British talent, it's a pretty great little supernatural-comedy. It's surprisingly dark and for once a T.V. show is not afraid to kill off characters. Well worth a watch and even if it doesn't get a second season, it is still worth the watch. CHECK IT OUT!",1338249600,,405,4.2727272727272725
4844941,5,B005N95QUM,"Wow!!  This blew me away, makes me wonder what's hppened to American filmaking. Sure hope its a season 2 If you enjoy horror and great characters this is for you!!Special effects were kicking too.",1333152000,,196,4.764705882352941

4844943,1,B005N95QUM,This is possible the worst Blu ray movie I have ever seen. Unless I have a defected disc. It appears as if the Blu ray was copied from a computer by way of a DVD. The blacks flicker through out the disc.  Has anyone else had this problem? Please let me know if this is part of the movie...created by the film maker. Horrorible blu ray quality! Will be returning ASAP.  The show looks good through.  Will have to wait for it on tv. I did find a solution. Playing this in 3d cuts down on the flickering and it looks alot better.,1331251200,5,526,4.087378640776699
4844944,5,B005N95QUM,"A creepy, scary series with alot of originality in it that will keep you guessing what the **** is going on here.  I love watching the BBC they hvae a different way of making flim/tv that is addicting rather than most of the same old that the US brings out on tv.

Is Paul an Angel or is he the Anti-Christ?  Who will survive the carnage.  Part-The Walking Dead part Zombie adds up to a hole lotta fun.

Turn the lights out and enjoy!  Dont be alone!",1329868800,21,450,4.114942528735632

Its more adult than Doctor Who, dark than Primeval and less nerdy than Torchwood (all shows I love by the way).  Any idea when we might see the next episode pop up?

4844948,4,B005N95QUM,"Interesting and well thought out. The teen angst gets to be too much at times: do I shag my girlfriend or save the world? Makes me hate teenagers. It's also tiring when a group of people want to save the world, but don't tell each other stuff, each one going it alone while working together? Uggh! And what do the flesh eating Fades do when there is no one left to eat? Enjoyable otherwise.",1520899200,,390,4.283783783783784
4844949,4,B005N95QUM,"I just finished episode 3. This is a really nice surprise. It's an interesting plot that moves at a nice speed, while allowing the characters to be well developed, and at all times revealing enough to keep me really interested.

It is well acted and inspires curiosity and it's a fresh twist on a zombie like supernatural thriller that fuses fantasy with science fiction, without overpowering you with the supernatural.

This is an intelligently constructed scifi, fantasy, adventure, zombie-vampire-like like series. Great fun!

Update: I had to knock off a star at Episode 6. It starting to not make any logical sense. Ascension points are the key to this series. When people die, we 'ascend.' It isn't like going to heaven. It's more like the ascension explained in ""Stargate"" Anyway, becasue of all of the building going up over the world, the ascension spots, or most of them, have been covered, and I assume since they are covered (as in covered by concrete building foundations), they don't work anymore. Thus, we can't ascend. If you don't ascend, you become a sort of ghost wandering around the world. Some of the ghosts get pissed off at being stuck between earth and ascension, and find a way back to a sort of vampire like zombie state, and the only way they can live is to eat humans. Anyway, in Episode 6, Paul opens an ascension gate, but something goes wrong. He does this by using his 'magical powers.' So the problem is why does covering an ascension gate make it unusable, and why simply uncovering it doesn't reopen it. If this is explained later, then ok, good. If not, then, ok, kinda cheesy.

The second problem is that with a city full of hungry zombies, Paul's mom decides to stay and wait for him, stranding her daughter and Jay at the same time, endangering them too. Sure. That's realistic. That's not even what a mother would do. Instinct wold be to protect her child that is with her, and worry about the child she has no control over later.

Third, Paul is a pacifist that doesn't want anyone to die, but refusing to kill the antagonist when he had the chance results in many others dying, including his girlfriend. This isn't, in itself, a logical problem, as long as it is explained--which it isn't, so far. And, it simply must be explained, otherwise Paul could have killed the antagonist, then tried to open the ascension gate to 'save' the other ghosts. That would have resulted in no one dying except the antagonist, who has already made it clear he wants to replace humans with come back to life zombies.

Yet, it will never be explained. The series ends abruptly at season 6. Too bad.",1519862400,,2623,4.666666666666667
4844950,4,B005N95QUM,"Wife and I found the series to be interesting enough that we watched it to completion in Episode 6 but felt the ending left a bit to be desired.

Kind of a SyFy type sci-fi film, not the best but certainly not the worst.

If you are a sci-fi fan and you have a Prime membership, definitely watch at least one episode...you will then most likely watch the entire series but I would not recommend paying to watch it if you do not have Prime.",1518652800,,439,4.152941176470589

4844952,3,B005N95QUM,"It was a decent show over all, a few things at the end pi$$ed me off but worst of all is they're not making a second season so there's no point really.  Alot of unanswered questions with an open ending and since there's no follow up, not much point.  btw, Neil's a dick, poor Jay.",1516838400,,280,4.072727272727272
4844953,5,B005N95QUM,"I dug this series, and I really, REALLY wish BBC hadn't cancelled it after season one. In my opinion, it was a cool show, and the characters very much grew on me. Be aware that it IS rather corny, but that's somehow why it lot's of fun to watch. If you're in the mood to binge watch a fun anf sort of lightweight SF British television series, I recommend this one. Again, FUN is the operational word here!",1515715200,3,405,4.205128205128205
4844954,3,B005N95QUM,"I wish I could give it more stars. I liked the idea behind the show. I watched all episodes hoping for a nice conclusion but was disappointed with the ending. The last episode is a true disaster... Characters' decisions simply made no sense.
The way it ended, it looked like it geared up for a new season. If they do make a second season, I hope they'll do a better job with the script. I'm unsure if I'd watch it.",1515542400,,414,4.1875
4844955,2,B005N95QUM,"Basically I enjoyed the first three episodes and stayed the course for the rest because I was enjoying the actors, not a lot of what they were handed to say, but rather their stylish performances in trying to make a directionless plot have meaning, heroism and consequences. Most of them anyway. The main character, a spineless millennial emo - and I mean take whinging to church steeple heights - was pretty much irritating for all six episodes, and his best friend, a splendid actor, had too much comedy relief mixed with utter distracting drivel to be of much use as a player. The one scene where he could've supported ""the cause"" in a fairly climactic gymnasium fistfight, he basically wall-flowered, and let a woman do the fighting against a big guy with a club.

In any case, the characters played out roles where they allowed the lameness of the story to go on because they did nothing to actually affect anything, and acted like the miracles the hero eventually performs are like, wow, look what you did, that was amazing - so what are we having for lunch? They would just let the main character stalk off to whinge about his new power and how much it confused his poor wittle brain. Their reactions were bland and ineffective because pushing him to be proactive would've actually brought the bad guys to a screeching halt, and since we've got the cash for six episodes, well, we'll just have to drag this thing out for the sake of those poor, desperate sponsors putting up the cash.

The story was too uncertain of its own inner struggle. Not good versus evil, but Yin Yang versus Yang Yin, so that you don't have any real hero anywhere, since the main character is also not sure of what he believes in, even to the point of letting his crush die by the presumed hand of the good guys, who by now have been written as also bad guys. It really seemed like someone had an idea and just got talked out of it by someone else as they wrote dialog. The writing, by the way, is mostly good, something I've come to enjoy from our friends across the pond, but when vague moral wishy-washiness reared its ugly head, I became disappointed. I hung in there for the sake of wonder regarding how they would resolve this alphabet soup they'd created in a satisfying way, which they didn't. People's decisions throughout are unrealistic nonsense to serve other plot points, which then play out in foolish ways themselves. Good grief, just end it...

My advice is don't watch it. You may get suckered in by the first few episodes like I did, and think it will have an eventual resolution that will be both interesting and enjoyable. Let me save you 5.5 hours of your life by telling you that's not in the cards. Kudos to Natalie Dormer, Sophie Wu, Johnny Harris, Joe Dempsie, and Lily Loveless.",1515110400,,2786,4.568
4844956,4,B005N95QUM,"I watched this on PBS when it was originally on years ago and loved it. I was so disappointed that they didn't make a 2nd season of The Fades and am now thrilled that I can see the 1st season again on Amazon. The plot takes a while to develop but once it does, it's very interesting and I looked forward to seeing how it would end.",1515110400,,331,3.955223880597015
4844957,1,B005N95QUM,Have the Brits ever produced a decent series or movie? NO! Do not waste your time! This is a horrible show. The actors are so terribly terrible. The production is so unrefined.

4844987,5,B005N95QUM,"_The Fades_ is like _Stranger Things_ in that both are steeped in genre (fantasy, sci-fi) and both are about teams of young people who have to be brave and savior-y. So if you like _Stranger Things_, you might want to check it out.

_The Fades_ is dark, sharply written, funny (actually funny), and an exciting pastiche of genre tropes and events. Jack Thorne's dialogue is just way way better and more interesting than we usually get to hear in this kind of story; similarly, the characters' engagement references familiar tropes (who ends up with whom? etc.) while providing a depth and engagement that I wish more stories about people running around trying to save the world with magic from supernatural bad-things did.

The performances are uniformly excellent.

It's a modern and witty fantasy-adventure story; it's a fantasy-adventure story with a chosen one and the rising hordes of evil and the rift between worlds and all of these pleasurable hooks of the genre -- just the writing is better, the dialogue's sharper, the sense of place and time is more specific, real, tangible.

If that might be your cup of tea, try it you might love it. I did.

Solid writing/acting and a great concept drive The Fades, a show about the supernatural, and what lies between life and death.  I found this show by searching fro other work by the brilliant Tom Ellis (Rush, Lucifer), and though his role in this is secondary, the show is pure brilliance. I get the feeling it might have been marketed for teens, but the quality is such that it won't keep you from wanting to watch. I was invested very quickly, and  They keep the tension up even during moments of lightheartedness.

4845115,4,B005N95QUM,"...then you might like this show. The first few episodes are definitely intriguing in a ""Sixth Sense"" kind of way. However, by the end it's more like ""Zombieland"" meets ""Mean Girls"" - silly zombies chasing even sillier teenagers.

Fair warning - this is NOT a spoiler-free review!

For the BBC fans:

The dialogue in this show is delightfully quirky and often downright funny in that uniquely British way. Although, to be honest, I had to watch this one with subtitles or I would have missed half of what was said. I only recognized a few actors - Natalie Dormer (""The Tudors"" & ""Game of Thrones"") and Claire Rushbrook (""Home Fires""), but overall the cast was outstanding. Daniel Kaluuya in particular was brilliant IMO.

For the Supernatural fans:

The first few episodes are loaded with omens, spirits, and a fairly unique take on what happens to your soul after you die. The show raises a lot of interesting questions - Is death fair? Do the concepts of good and evil exist in the afterlife? How, why, and what happens if a soul can't move on? There's a lot of chew on, and combined with excellent CGI and production values, the first few episodes are riveting.

For the Horror fans:

There's quite a bit of gore in this show. And, when it comes to the horror genre, they threw in everything but the kitchen sink. In a nutshell - zombies (undead...well, dead people); alien-looking slime-covered pods (to grow pod people); corpses ripped apart and eaten; loads of vomiting (and insects crawling out of people's mouthes)...you get the idea. While a lot of it feels recycled, I have to admit it was effective. I was cringing through just about every episode.

For the YA / Teen Genre fans:

The main character is an akward, socially-challenged 17 year-old boy who has the hots for a popular girl. That just about says it all. This show isn't just dripping with teen angst, it's swimming in it - high school, alienation & bullying, clueless parents, sex (& losing one's virginity)...again, you get the idea. There's a fair amount of ""Freaks & Geeks"" influence throughout the show, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

OVERALL:

The Fades starts out as a fantastically creepy horror/thriller about dead souls and a teenage boy with the power to see them. It lures you in with mysterious characters (the ""Angelics""), evil spirits, and unexplained omens...and a hefty does of British snark to keep it from being too dark. I was intrigued.

Unfortunately all those promising plot lines get tangled up in a convoluted web of...I don't even know what. Some of it does tie together in the end (the ash, the wings), but most of the show's mythology is never really explained. What starts out as a supernatural thriller basically evolves/devolves (take your pick) into a clichd zombie apocalypse...only to have the writers say, ""oh yeah, we forgot about the ash & the wings"" so they crammed some of that ""supernatural"" stuff in at the very end.

It also doesn't help that it ends on a whopper of a cliffhanger. Fair warning - this got cancelled with zero wrap-up, so we'll never know what any of it meant, really. Shame.

Anyway, all that aside, The Fades was surprisingly interesting for such a hot mess. I'm not surprised it was cancelled, and I'm irked that it ended with so much unresolved, but IMO it was a fairly creative addition to the horror genre and worth watching. Solid 4 stars.",1467504000,,3383,4.750853242320819

They didn't really go into the ""where they came from"" or how, but instead went full steam ahead.  I would love to see this come back, but not sure after 5 years have gone by since last production.
Plus he's a big time actor now, so I'm not sure if he'd want to come back.  I wished he would.  I loved ALL the characters.  Of course, the majority of the antagonists are gone, including the main ""bad"" guy.  Let's see.  Maybe someone important will see this little gem.",1466553600,,644,4.3

The 6 episode season was better than I expected, and does end with a (sort of) resolution.  I wish it had been continued, but then maybe we wouldn't have Tom Ellis as the lead in the Fox series ""Lucifer,"" and IMHO he deserves a lead actor role, not just a supporting role such as he had here!

4845299,5,B005N95QUM,"One of the best ghost stories made for the screen -- large or small -- this BBC marvel from Jack Thorne (Skins, the Last Panthers) ran for one six-episode season before being unjustly canceled even though it was a critical and ratings hit. (The BBC, lacking funds as usual, decided to produce a fifth season of Being Human instead of committing to this series.)

The supernatural premise, that some souls ""move on"" while others are left behind is terrific because it's presented as an inexplicable event that seems to be morally and theologically-neutral: Good people don't always move on (or go to heaven). Unable to interact with the living world, they are forced to look on helplessly as teh world adn their loved ones go on living and changing. Some go mad. One dark spirit channels his rage for decades until he's able to move objects, hurt people and so on through a really creepy, bloody, violent academical process. The nasty, flesh eating dude has an apocalyptic plan to bring all the fades back to the living world.

A young Iain De Caestecker (Marvel's agents of shield) stars as a high school kid who happens to be an ""Angelic,"" of a very few people able to see the ghosts, or fades as they're called. He turns out to be so much more, a powerful prophet or savior figure with great power. (The scene where he suddenly grows massive angelic wings while having a wank is amazing.)

The teenage banter with his fellow geek BFF (Joe Dempsie) is great as is his angsty crush on the best friend of his mean girl twin sister (Lily Loveless), a popular, but secretly nerdy girl (Sophie Wu).

There's equal parts comedy, romance and nerve-jangling horror here and a lyrical tragic love story between a fellow Angelic (Natalie Dormer) and  her estranged husband (Tom Ellis). There's even a police procedural angle -- the father of the Joe Dempsie character is a detective assigned to solve a series of grisly murders that are somehow connected to the high school ...

The Fades was as near a perfect TV show as  I've seen in a long time. It was pulpy of course but it never obscured the human drama for empty scares.

The BBC deprived fans of a great series.",1460160000,,2160,4.6214099216710185

4845315,3,B005N95QUM,"You have to let go of the fact that this 6-episode series completely distorts Biblical concepts if you want to enjoy this show. It would have been better if the creators co-opted another religion's terminology and iconography. Why they allowed themselves to be pulled into bastardizing the Christian apocalypse I'll never know. It makes their storyline incoherent. Why do I say this is based on the Apocalypse in the Bible. Well, Biblical stories are alluded to in quite a few places. The ending uses imagery directly pulled from Revelation.

Basic storyline (spoiler alert) 

Apparently, 'angelics' (the supposed good guys) can curse and murder and not feel shame or remorse whereas the 'fades' seem to be non-coporeal until they go Dracula on someone and eat their flesh. Then they are doomed to wander around having to eat people in order to live. That's supposition, since it isn't fully fleshed out (no pun intended) in the series. Once having eaten flesh, they become immortal for some reason. John is their leader.

In walks Paul, the super teenage angelic who is 'special' and can kill fades that have become corporeal. Despite fornicating with his girlfriend, Paul apparently has a good heart and wants to save the fades by re-opening the original ascension point. What this does or where specifically it takes them, I can't tell. It certainly appears to take them to another dimension or plane of existence. Whether that is Heaven, I can't tell. Again, not fully explained in the series. If it were Heaven, they apparently everybody goes there so this (Universalism) is non-traditional Christian theology.

Most troubling to me is that the presence of God is absent as is the foundation of the Apocalypse - the return of Christ. The fades who just got done terrorizing a (now evacuated) town by tearing apart people (kids and adults alike) to eat them are all ascended at the end. Seemed like a painful process too. Go figure.

Characterizations are good. Lots of teenage angst and sexual longing. The sexual act is shown 2-3 times. Didn't care for the language, though. This is more a thriller than a horror show (gore is implied though there is plenty of terror to go around). Definitely creates an eerie mood. You will have to decide for yourself whether it is something you want to go through all six episodes for. You'll probably determine if you want to continue after the 2nd show and maybe 10 minutes into the 3rd.",1421798400,,2432,4.876513317191283
4845316,3,B005N95QUM,"This is a show that has the potential to be so much more. The supernatural elements are a welcome break from the current glut of vampires and wizards, and many elements of the mythology were modestly original--not to mention that the ghosts give it a strong element of religious horror. The acting is generally strong, and the Fades are genuinely scary.
But....

The series suffers from an unpleasant combination of horror and comedy tropes. Let me first mention the BIG one: These characters are suckers. Seriously. First scene of the first episode. Suppose that you are a seasoned Angelic, patrolling an area that you suspect to be haunted. You see a shadowy figure crouched, unmoving. Do you: (a) Approach the figure, asking whether it is hurt, even when it fails to respond, or (b) run as fast as you can. If you answered (b), you are less likely to be thrown through a roof to your death. Happily, that one of their own fell prey to this technique does not dissuade Paul and Neil from following it blindly, leading to Paul getting electrocuted and Neil being mauled. Special mention goes to Neil for apparently following a ghost into a deserted town, while he should have been keeping an eye on Paul, apparently to ask her why she was tearing apart some young children! The ranks of the Angelics rapidly deplete, which fits well in a horror movie, but does not really explain how they have been able to keep an eye on the Fades for what was presumably a long time.

The comedic tropes do an equal amount to torpedo the likeability of the characters, with both Paul and Michael coming across as mildly selfish, socially impaired nerds who are apparently quite inept at finding romance, an activity which constitutes their main obsession (or at least Michael's), even as the apocalypse looms. Our hero's sister is appallingly unlikeable and one- dimensional--again, a comedic standby. The obnoxious sibling is fine when a show is not meant to be taken seriously, but her characterization is entirely superficial. It would not be exaggerating to say that every word out of her mouth by at least the third episode is an insult, with no indication that she exists for any purpose than to put others down. It's not that she's mean. It's that, in the paraphrased words of Taylor Swift, all she's gonna be is mean. This lack of characterization also strikes his mother, and some other fairly major characters. It also quickly becomes clear that Paul is a Mary Sue (""I'm an Angelic Swiss Army Knife!..."") whose inability to resolve most situations comes from the aforementioned stupidity. And--not to complain or anything--but tangibility of the Fades presents a Catch-22. How do they become tangible enough to kill? By eating flesh. How do they eat flesh? Well, they must be tangible.... All of these issues detract from what is honestly a very interesting premise. If Paul, instead of being a self-obsessed Mary Sue forced to carry both the Idiot and Comedy balls (erasing his sister's mouth, anyone?), were a competent and complex hero with a more limited power set, and the Angelics exercised caution in the pursuit of what is clearly a very dangerous job, this series would deserve at least four stars.",1421625600,,3203,4.832422586520948

So many other reviewers have very eloquently expressed why this show is so well done and well acted so I will keep this brief and just say that I also found this show to be incredible. The only folks I would respectfully recommend to stay away from this are those who can't handle gore, violence and mild adult themes (i'm not judging, just warning!!) but if you love this genre--it's a must see!",1420934400,,515,4.431578947368421

His best friend -- truly, a best friend -- is great; funny, without being the all-too-often comic relief annoyance one sees in so many things (nanoo, nanoo).

His nemesis and antithesis, the main demon guy, is actually fairly scary in the beginning, before his rebirth, and Natalie is creepy fun as well.

Nonetheless, it felt rushed to conclusion. You'll see what I mean. Was it an inevitability, or a HUGE mistake? I thought it needed a few more episodes, and the end is a total cliffhanger, yet, there is no doubt as to what it means for everyone; like, on earth, everyone.

Invest the time. You'll be pleasantly surprised and certainly entertained.",1420502400,,848,4.868055555555555

It's kinda hard to be original when the show follows this type of arc, but they do a pretty good job with it. My only disappointment: sometimes i feel like it moves a tad slow, or rather sometimes (not all the time) the climax of whatever is going on just seems a little...weak. Well, not necessarily weak, but felt like it should go a different direction. Me at my most honest - The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is slightly better than 3 for me.

4845404,4,B005N95QUM,"The Fades is an interesting series.  It has an ""as it is happening"" apocryphal theme with zombies and is definitely ""British"" in that hand guns are portrayed as VERY bad things, especially in the hands of obsessed people (which they are, don't get me wrong).  When you get beyond that and adjust your ""paradigm"" sunglasses to British culture and society, The Fades becomes a good storytelling series.  It is unpredictable by not revealing too much of the plot beforehand and keeps the viewer interested in what comes next.  I watched season 1 in it's entirety and I have to say I will watch season 2.  Not necessarily to find out what happens to the main character, but what happens to the anti-hero who gives an almost prophetic warning at the finale of season 1.
The filming and acting are good but not great and the plot has some hiccups in it, but overall I give the production 4 out of 5 stars.",1414281600,,899,4.5246913580246915

The show was so disjointed and confusing (it needed to be set up better) and all these characters are just THERE and we don't have any kind of backstory at all, so there's no investment. Also, the main ""hero"" is a whiny, self-obsessed teenage boy (that may be redundant, I know) and his sidekick is so annoying that I just wanted him to be killed. He speaks so quickly and with such a strong accent that I had NO IDEA what he was saying 90% of the time, and all he does is follow the main character around, yakking incessantly. It seems as if he had no function, like maybe the writers went, ""Oops! We forgot to include a black character."" This show seemed to be trying to be like ""The Walking Dead"" but it isn't 1/100th as good as TWD.",1411516800,2,819,4.222929936305732

Although it would be nice to have more seasons (series) I have to disagree with many other reviews on here that state that nothing was resolved.

The script they gave him was non-sense e.g ""Na-nu,na-nu"" in each episode. They also had him talking gibberish during an emergency situation i.e when he and Anna were handcuffed.

4845515,3,B005N95QUM,"British teenager Paul has a troubled life. His dad left the family a while back and Paul is having nightmares of the apocalyptic variety. He and his friend Mac are the biggest nerds at school (though Mac is always quoting 1980s movies, so he might be the nerdiest of all). Even Paul's sister can barely stand them. He has a strained relationship with the school counselor/therapist. If all that wasn't bad enough, now he can see dead people, called the Fades.

Luckily, he runs into a group of people who also can see the Fades (they call themselves Angelics) and who have been working to keep the Fades from causing trouble. New trouble is brewing because some of the Fades have taken to eating human flesh (which doesn't make sense since they don't interact with the living in any other way), which causes them to be ""reborn"" into bodies. Naturally, the Fades think they are the next step in evolution and pursue their agenda with gusto. Can Paul stop them and fix up his broken life?

The story is told over six hour-long episode, so there is plenty of time for character development, major plot twists/reversals, scares, and chases. The premise is fairly unbelievable but the characters are interesting enough and the writing sharp enough to make it enjoyable. The last episode finished the story but left open more developments. That is unlikely to happen since the series finished in 2011 and there's no sign of a second series being greenlit.

Parental Advisory: There's a bit of swearing and a lot of sex (though only shadowy nudity) in the show. Also, it is a bit gory when they fight and when the Fades are ""reborn."" Recommended for late teens and up.",1407715200,,1661,4.701030927835052

4845588,5,B005N95QUM,"Let me start by saying, as an American, I prefer American TV, movies, and books.  I like the sound of the Texas twang, New Yorkers speed talk, and the slow drawl of the south.  I like the way we spell our words, and nothing will jerk me out of a book faster than a word spelled in the British way as opposed to the American, and because of all that I avoid all BBC productions and books written with British spellings.  So when I first saw the The Fades, and the eerily sci-fi screen picture in the show recap, I was intrigued and interested until I saw that it was a British production.  I avoided the show, though it kept popping up in my Prime searches for new viewing.  Finally broke down and decided to try it for a few minutes...and that was all it took to hook me.

I won't recap the plotline because many others have already done that.  But I will tell you that the producers and writers on this show did an outstanding job.  Its nutty enough to make you laugh at times, frightful enough to make a jaded American tense, and interesting enough to keep me coming back over a two day period to watch all six episodes.  While this show was meant as a series season one, the end of episode six wraps up enough to leave you satisfied...but not content.  The writers left enough in that last show to make you want more.  I seriously can't believe this show was cancelled.

Some reviewers have written that they wish someone would remake the show (I'm assuming they want someone in the US to remake it like other recent series), and if that were to happen, yes, I would watch.  But I can assure you it would not be as good as the original.  This particular cast of actors were amazingly integrated and perfectly suited to each other.  The old world feel of their home town (from an American standpoint it was almost retro), the typical dark cinematography of the BBC, and even the 'off' color of the film (dull and washed out colors) all combined to make you feel like you were watching a horror film from the sixties or early seventies.  And it suited the writers storyline perfectly.  No doubt a remake would be interesting...but it wouldn't be The Fades.

So give yourselves a treat, and if you haven't watched it yet...watch just one episode.  Its like a Lays potato chip...betcha can't watch just one.",1404777600,,2306,4.421800947867299
4845589,3,B005N95QUM,"Pretty interesting. Not my cup of tea. Not a teenager anymore, so I don't relate to the ""adults are stupid, kids know better"" mindset. The only reason I finished it was because it has decent CG. The rest I could do without.",1404777600,,223,4.333333333333333

It took a couple of episodes before I understood the characters, but it hooked me hard about half way through. Great characters, and typically solid British acting.  The show was scripted with great humor juxtaposed against a horrific end of the world as we know it scenario.

I just loved it.  But according to BBC, the show didn't appeal enough to the 18-32 year old audience.  How sad.  Sad for the BBC if that age group is now their measuring stick.  And sad for all of us who wished the show had not faded away prematurely.

Definitely worth watching the one season, regardless.  Be warned, though, this show is way too intense for young viewers.  Some parts are horrific in the true sense of the word.",1399852800,2,984,4.56

This story line should really be classified somehow stereotypical but the slightly skewed take and raw British humor combined with twists and a plot that gives you just enough to NOT be confused and asking for more make it unique and intriguing.

The goofy kid that's going to become a hero is repeated theme, and it has been used successfully in many films.

A Vampire story with a different origin and physicis in their Vampires and ghosts then normal,

My feeling is that they were still writing the script while filming, and so the heros dithering on what he should be doing seems a little long but the scenes themselves are great.  the last two episodes changed from a slow moving dark scary show to a much faster, runing around a school bashing vampire heads in.  My suggesting is to make the vampire scarier is to make them need to feed less oftin and have fewer scenes of them getting hit over the head by kids.

4845852,4,B005N95QUM,"You'll be hard pressed to find a more visually stunning TV show in the sci-fi/horror genre then this. Abandoned malls, spooky underground vaults, dark forests, forgotten insane asylums, isolated farm houses and more are all featured. The acting is very good and the show manages to cram in a lot of themes in the short 6 hours it has. The two main characters - outcast teenage boys - were both realistic and rateable. So often the heroes in shows are cocky, sure, and pig-headed, it was refreshing to see heroes who are none, but really grew into their role throughout the show. The main villain, John, was also very well written and well-acted. His motives were complex and made sense so that you might find yourself empathizing with him and questioning if he was really a villain at all.

The bad in this show - I guess with such an original storyline, the cliche quota still had to get filled. There's ""shrieking woman"" in the form of Paul's mom who seems to regress to a bundle of nerves without a brain by episode 4 or 5. There's ""let's split up to save time"" when there are literally no time constraints on the characters at all.  There's ""let's follow this clearly bad person right into a trap, even though they did this exact same thing to us just yesterday."" But while these were eye-roll inducing, they were minor and wouldn't normally cause me to turn a 5 star show into a 4 star.

What annoyed me the most was the character Neil and the show explaining more about its world in its ""summaries"" by Mac then in the show itself. Pretty sure the first time we hear the word ""Angelic"" is when Mac tells us in a ""summary."" Neil starts off the show as a kind of wanna-be mentor for Paul, but never actually explains anything to him. He learns more in a 5 minute conversation with John then he does from the hours he spends with Neil. Neil also expects instant loyalty from Paul without any explanations. Later, he's made into a quasi-villain, perhaps because the writers realized how dumb and misguided he was coming across. Some might say the entire purpose of the character was to show the Angelics were misguided in their fight - except Neil isn't the only Angelic and he doesn't even seem to be the boss or anything. Since we're told the Angelics have been fighting the fades for 70+ years, we have to assume that they are all just really dumb - so dumb they never even bother to talk to the fades, even though many of them are perfectly capable of speaking.

The last episode does end in on, what I'll call, a plot ledge, as a plot cliff would be too dramatic a term. That's to be expected in a TV show unsure if it'll get another season or not, but if you hate not having every loose end tied up, this isn't the show for you.",1384905600,,2735,4.40990099009901

This show was one of the best supernatural thrillers I have ever seen. It needs to be run again on the  USA scyfi channel.
What it really needs is a sequel. We want to see a sequel some years later with grown up characters.
The BBC series was a little more explicit than US viewers are used to. I was uncomfortable watching teenagers being intimate with themselves and each other. But that's British tv.
The storyline was great. The characters well written and believable.

I need:

1.  A likeable, believable character.  If I'm indifferent towards the cast who cares what their lot is?
2.  Believable world please; I found this world met that criteria.
3.  A plot wouldn't kill you.  I know a little ambiguity plot wise can make things interesting, but I found The Fades gave a lot away initially without letting any WTF set in.

After checking the internet and finding out that The Fades was cut, I was very disappointed.  This series reminded me of Walking Dead with a different zombie concept.  There actually was a reason for the zombies to feed.  No being able to tell between the dead and the living was also a great twist, allowing the viewing to try and figure out who is good or bad.  Why this series was cut, I haven't a clue.  All I can say is that this decision was truly a huge mistake!  Bring back The Fades.",1376179200,,583,4.293577981651376

All the main characters make themselves into someone to be identified with, showing human traits of complexity, strength, and flaws of the type anyone might make while thinking on his/her feet. I enjoy the brooding dream scenes as they bleed into events within the waking world. Just enough plot twists to keep me coming back for more.

Although there was so much potential which I anxiously waited to be delivered to me, the writers failed to deliver what it truly deserved: a much better script which excluded unnecessary fluff (e.g. excessively annoying rambling, missing Ah-Ha moments, and missing WOW moments).

I believe the series would have achieved so much more if the writers would have taken this endeavor much more seriously.

The production was incredible.  The quality of the production alone demanded my attention since I frequently use this as the initial determining factor as to whether or not a film is worth my time.  Of which, it passed the 5 minute worth watching rule.

Again, watching this series through the end speaks to my longing for a great 5 star series however it earned only a solid 3.  Oh what feelings of melancholy.",1374710400,,954,4.851851851851852

4845982,5,B005N95QUM,"By happenstance, I came across the series as I was looking for shows similar to Being Human. It is very riveting, I watched the entire first season over the course of 3 days.  This is supposedly a horor/comedy/coming of age/angels vs the dead amalgam of a brit show. The central character is the main plot of the show, with the Angelics showing up as fillers. Paul is a boy who has visions, slowly it begins to unravel that he is more than just a boy. He has powers and being the introverted type has a hard time coming to terms with his powers.
The mixture of comedy is injected into this show, but unfortunately I could not really laugh along the jokes. It seemed very mean and the delivery very dry. His best friend offering lots of comic relief with constant sci-fi movie references balances out the show from being overtly serious.
This show tries to take some chances with deaths of some major characters. Central characters are shown as flawed to the extent of exhibiting Jekyll and Hyde turnabouts. This issue unsettled me, I could not fully understand the characters or feel for them. Are they written just for shock value and to keep the viewers guessing? Squibbles aside, I believe most viewers will be rewarded watching the show. It's a pitty that the show was not renewed.

He is watching them kill people saying the entire time: I don't want to hurt you, please stop eating that person, I am your friend, I want to help you (he didn't really say all this but might as well have).

It gets three stars because of the pretty graphic sex & masturbation scenes. That's mostly because I'm American and I'm not used to a lot of sex on TV.

4846048,5,B005N95QUM,"Very rarely does a TV show make me jump or gasp. I'm a fan of horror/sci-fi/supernatural/apocalyptic genres but rarely do they really, truly, get to me. The first episode of this show was like watching everything I've ever wanted in a show and more.
The acting is fantastic, the plot, while obviously fiction, sucks you in. There's a psychological element to this story that makes you want to keep watching.
While the story is not something that you'd normally believe, the characters are all very believable and that's what makes it good. There's a fair amount of gore, so if you're squeamish about blood, don't watch. If you're looking for a sparkly vampire type of thing, don't bother. This show is much deeper, much darker and much more chilling, yet it also has a fair amount of comic relief. A perfect balance.
The main character is charmingly geeky and his sidekick is adorably annoying. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I won't go into detail about all of the characters but it is definitely worth a watch. 5 stars for anything is rare from me but this show is a rarity. I can't find anything I don't like about it.
Each episode feels like a movie and the story line gets more intense. I've watched four episodes so far and each has been more exciting and more disturbing than the last.",1367020800,,1300,4.55982905982906

I did like seeing the ghosts, but I didn't feel anything for them because they only showed the turned fades mostly. The turned fades were the ones trying to be human again. Though when they turned, they become cannibalistic eating the humans they so wanted to be again. It was a vicious cycle that definitely needed a hope.

In recent times about the only thing I can think of that has caught my attention for any length of time has been Heroes and Supernatural,.  But even that I grew weary of.  But The Fades, captivated me!

I'm not sure if maybe a big part of the attraction is its being a BBC production and therefore a different culture all American shows or if it truly is a good story line with good actors and special effects, but either way, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for suspense in a fantasy, otherworldly genre. The Fades redeems some characters that up front you would think were written into the story just to be killed off later and many of the more attractive characters are killed off later in the show.  I don't want to say I like that but I have to admit it's a welcome change from US shows/movies where the hero always survives and the villain nearly always dies (the exception of course is when there is some consideration given to a sequel - you can't kill off the bad guy then!)

4846091,5,B005N95QUM,"I came upon this program by chance, and was riveted enough to view the entire season within a few days,  as it never lets up on suspense and terror.  Basically, ""Angelic"" people are fighting dead souls who are unable to ascend, and so have found a way to live again by eating blood and flesh.  Paul, the protagonist, is a teenaged boy with the ability to see the dead, who is recruited into the ranks of the Angelics against his will.

It also shows that we don't have to depend on vampires, werewolves and witches for that supernatural entertainment. The BBC hits another one out of the park with this series, unfortunately, it appears that this hype is a little too late, as the series has already been cancelled. I'd like to see hulu or netflix or even Amazon pick this one up for a renewal. It's a good ride, while it lasts.",1361491200,99,516,4.559139784946237

The storyline takes forever to get off the ground and the episodes are very slow paced and rather confusing. I had no idea where the series was headed or what was going on, so I don't have any investment in watching more. Characters have already died but I can't care because I don't have a clue who they were and whether they're good guys or bad guys. I'd have to characterize this show as just ""faded,"" like an old photo left out in the sun.",1361145600,,563,4.320754716981132

i watched every episode back-to-back.  kick back and enjoy a six-hour epic movie that is both tragic and funny.  This is a great supernatural yarn and the season stands on its own as a story arc.  great writing, great characters, fine performances, great casting, great production values.  and free with amazon prime at the time of this review! five stars!",1360281600,,617,4.884615384615385

The characters are all well written and the actors take the characters from the page and add life to them.  Every character is well played.

The direction is very well thought out.

The Fades deserves attention, not just from horror fans, but from anyone who enjoys a good story and appreciates fine acting, great writing, and solid film-making (provided they can tolerate some gore and flesh). An excellent mix of wit, drama, sex, mythos, pop culture, and of course horror, executed with uncompromising production values and in the discerning style that keeps BBC TV in a league of it's own.

I'll leave the synopsis to other reviewers, and I honestly don't expect anyone to watch the show based on this missive. I just wanted to go on record as being a fan.
