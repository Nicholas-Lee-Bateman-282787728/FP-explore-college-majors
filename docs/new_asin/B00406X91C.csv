8412163,2,B00406X91C,"This is such an incoherent mess where one can very easily become bored and tired of trying to make sense of whatever story there was. It jumped around from one scene to another (sex-clubs, private parties, photo shoots, etc.), disregarding any continuity whatsoever. ""Stundenplan einer Verfhrung"" (from 1972, and directed by Hans Billian), didn't feel or look like a sex-comedy either, but more like a genuine ""hardcore"" film where they edited-out all the nasty bits! Anyway, if one is going to watch this, might as well try to get the original ""hardcore"" version. Don't get me wrong there was plenty of sexy gals on hand, but all things considered, nothing to get your ""knickers in a twist""!! The ladies: Britt Corvin, Gaby Borck, Angelika Frank, Anna Kristina, Marie Luise Lusewitz (uncredited).

The DVD picture quality was very good but the sound however, was on the low-side and sometimes non-existent. German (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 80 mins. (BTW: I bought the DVD through Amazon.de for 8.40 euros.)

Love and Peace,
