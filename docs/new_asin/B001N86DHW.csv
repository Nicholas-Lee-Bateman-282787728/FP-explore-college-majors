8323314,5,B001N86DHW,I saw this in a surfing magazine and ordered a copy for our five and seven year old sons. There are some nice touches and an overall good feeling about the cartoon. Lovable characters and environmental awareness about kelp.,1232928000,,223,4.743589743589744
8323315,3,B001N86DHW,I bought this for my 6 year old nephew and watched it while babysitting. He enjoyed the cartoon and wanted more animation and less extras with people talking. It's a typical silly cartoon with surfing thrown in.,1232323200,,211,4.72972972972973
8323316,4,B001N86DHW,"When we're at the beach, my 8 year old spends all day in the Pacific. She's fascinated with surfers and dreams of being in surf magazines. When she sees something related to surfing, my wallet gets lighter. It's nice to find a video geared toward her age group (although I must admit, I didn't know what to expect) After I previewed the DVD, we watched the cartoon together. It kept her attention, she commented on the characters and watched it a couple times since.
It's a simple, TV-type cartoon with friendly characters (the bad guy even seems harmless) There's a documentary kelp extra that's similar to a PBS/DiscoveryKids show. The ""Art of"" extras seem focused toward teens or adults who want to draw cartoons. No interest to youngsters.
Overall cute, light entertainment for young beachgoers.",1231718400,,799,4.925925925925926
