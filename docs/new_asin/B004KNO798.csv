4397276,5,B004KNO798,"This movie was so creative and the stories kept me wanting more. The movie has five short stories that tell their own dark twisted tale. The characters are so complex that you will be left wanting more. The first story told the twisted tale of father and daughter who are overly comfortable with one another leaving the man's fianc to wonder ""What the hell is going on?"" The fianc becomes overly consumed with their strange relationship that she soon doesn't realize what is reality or fiction. The second story was about a woman and man's adventurous sex life going a little too far for the woman and she soon begins to be overly obsessed and a little delusional. The third story was about a gay couple that adopted an African child who they soon realize may not have been the best decision. The fourth story spun a web of three rowdy and rambunctious little boys being taken care of by their stoned babysitter while their rich parents travel the world. The boys want to solve a mystery concerning one of their housekeepers and the story takes off from there. The fifth and final story is the darkest but the most intriguing. Zo Saldano is a single woman that is raped by an unknown assailant. She quickly identifies the assailant and without going too much into detail the story gets really interesting from there.

Burning Palms will be one of those movies that will have everyone talking for years to come. Some of the scenerios were so dark and twisted that it was laugh out loud funny. This movie should be turned into a television series so that I can know the background and why the people were behaving in this manner. If there is not a part II to this movie I would hope that HBO's ""In Treatment"" take on some of these cases because I need to know these characters. A must see movie.",1306627200,5,1793,4.516923076923077

Spotlighting characters living in the LA area, from Santa Monica to the San Fernando Valley, the story unfolds in five, short vignettes showcasing moments in the lives of a set of characters.

The subject matter ranges from a father-daughter relationship that is ""too close for comfort"" to an assaulted woman with an unusual response to her attacker.  In between you can stumble onto the terrain of boredom with spoiled brats taking things up a notch when they hold a ""kangaroo court.""

Kinky sexual hijinks send one young college student to a psychiatric hospital.

Even as I found some of the subject matter almost horrifying, I could not stop watching.  It literally grabbed me and held on until the very end.  The actors included Dylan MacDermott, Lake Bell, Shannen Doherty, Zoe Saldana, and Nick Stahl.  For the performances and the presentation, I would give this one four stars.  The subject matter is such that potential viewers should be forewarned, although the R rating may suffice.  I know that I couldn't stop thinking about this one.",1306540800,2,1278,5.678947368421053
4397278,3,B004KNO798,"What is normal?  This is a movie about five different groups of people.  A very close father and daughter. A boyfriend with a strange bedroom habit. A gay couple who want to adopt. A boy who is a borderline psychopath, and a women who falls in love with her attacker.  Very, very strange.  Very offensive in parts, and also pretty good.  This movie I really liked, and I don't think I should of.  When you watch it you will see why.  This is a hard movie to recommend because of the subject matter.  But if you like movies that are very different and not a movie that has been re-done 50 times this is the one for you.  I liked it, but again if you are easily offended do not watch this.  I give it a B.

4397279,2,B004KNO798,"I began watching this movie with the clear understanding that it was going to be a different take on human circumstances, interactions and responses.  I also know that indie films tend to take quirky to a different level.  I found the actors in each vignette to be fluid in their interpretation of their characters; no one seemed jarring.  The subject matter itself was where the jolt came from.  The situations were thought-provoking, much of the dialogue and situations were patently used to evoke a negative response from the viewer.  The extremes in much of the movie could be used for comedic purposes or tragedy unfortunately some of the devices used when the ultimate goal was laughter left me feeling that the line-crossed was simply too far for me to find any humor.  I am still not clear what I am supposed to take away from the film other than the ability to recognize that some situations made me uncomfortable and to recognize that feeling?  The flow of the movie was also a bit uneven so I left the film on several occasions and came back to complete it several times.",1306368000,2,1082,4.663157894736842
4397280,3,B004KNO798,"This movie isn't what I expected. This actually came sugested to me as 'suited' for me through the Vine program.
Otherwise I wouldn't have likely ordered this movie, but it looked interesting, so I did.
It turns out that it's not suited to me, go figure the Vine.

This is a VERY unusual movie of five different segmants. ALL of which are quite disturbing.
The D.V.D. case said ""It's like ""Crash"", but with crazy, perverted people"".
""Crash"" had some continual connectivity. This movie does not, nor do I see any other likeness to ""Crash"".

The editoral review, nor the description on the D.V.D. case prepares you for this content.
It has beem repeatedly stated what the content is about,
so I'll only say that this movie is for a select group that may enjoy this style of Macabre,
twisted satirial excitement.

This movie IS DEFINITELY R RATED OR MORE, as said on the editorial review.
This is obviously NOT family entertainment.",1306281600,,929,4.75776397515528
4397281,4,B004KNO798,"The memorable, entertaining, and decidedly adults-only ""Burning Palms"" delivers five edgy, shocking, often funny tales, all centering around sexual and social taboos, and various other sex-related themes.  Once you get into the mood of the movie, which is that it's basically a sex-drenched ""Tales From the Crypt"" (right down to the comic-book graphics that introduce each segment), you'll enjoy the over-the-top plot developments and shock endings.

My wife and I did utter a few ""Oh, come on!"" type comments throughout, in response to some of the characters' actions, but to be fair, the filmmakers were probably going for those particular audience reactions.  The second story, about a young girl's mental breakdown after her boyfriend asks her to perform a fairly mild (in our opinion) bit of kinkiness, particularly caused some eye-rolling.  Aren't these characters supposed to be sophisticated, nothing-can-shock-us residents of hip-and-trendy L.A.?  Still, the tale was entertaining, as are all the stories to varying degrees.

The final segment, about a young woman's unconventional response to her recent rape, was actually done pretty much as a straight drama, and ended up being the most memorable of the tales.  What would most women do if they stumbled upon the identity of their masked attacker, including his full name, home address, and work address?  They probably wouldn't do what this woman does during the course of the movie's thoughtful, complex closing story.

""Burning Palms"" is well acted by an interesting combination of familiar faces and talented lesser-known actors, and sharply directed by Christopher B. Landon (the son of actor Michael Landon). The movie looked and sounded great on the standard DVD we watched.

Give ""Burning Palms"" a shot if you're at all open to this type of material.  It's worth a look.",1306281600,4,1840,5.310344827586207
4397282,2,B004KNO798,"Okay, I knew when I read the description this movie would be on the racy side, but unfortunately most of it was disgusting. Each story had lots of language and graphic sex scenes. I could forgive both if the stories had been engaging. Because the blurb on the back said this was like Crash I expected there to be some connection between each story, but if there was any I sure didn't see it. The characters in the stories had little redeeming qualities. I prefer characters that I can cheer on--but these were lacking. I'm sure there is probably an audience for this kind of movie, but it wasn't me. Too much grossness and creepiness for me. The quality of the actual film making was good, the actors did a good job with their parts--though I can't imagine having to play some of those characters. I love movies--but not this one.

4397283,4,B004KNO798,"Written and directed by Christopher B. Landon, BURNING PALMS (2011) is a mixed bag.

It's an anthology movie consisting of five unrelated stories, each one taking place in a different part of Los Angeles.

The production values and performances in the rather perverse quintet are all first-rate, and each of the individual stories is intriguing.  Some of them, however, work much better than others.

I particularly liked the comic tale about a gay couple (Peter Macdissi, Anson Mount) that decides to ""adopt"" an African child, as well as the story about the father  (Dylan McDermott) who has a ""close"" relationship with his teenage daughter (Emily Meade) that makes his fiance (Rosamund Pike) very uncomfortable.

The other stories are okay, but they lack focus and their resolutions are somewhat disappointing.

Among the rest of the well-chosen cast are Paz Vega, Lake Bell, Nick Stahl, Zoe Saldana, Jon Polito and Jamie Chung.

4397295,3,B004KNO798,"Writer/Director Christopher Landon (Paranormal Activity 1- 4, Disturbia, Dirty Sexy Money) has pasted together five unrelated stories and placed them before the audience like an O'Henry buffet. Cast with some excellent actors (one wonders why they signed on to this project) some of the stories work better than others, but the problem is that the story line of each deals with some dark material that is placed in an attempted comedic vein: most are not at all funny.

Traveling around different areas of Los Angeles Landon pulls up situational stories that are apparently supposed to represent life in those particular zones. Very bad for tourism as well as somewhat challenging for the real neighborhood personnel! Santa Monica: a woman (Rosamund Pike) becomes alarmingly concerned over her fianc&eacute;'s (Dylan McDermott) unnaturally close relationship with his teenage daughter (Emily Meade). In Westwood, a sexual act requested by a man (Robert Hoffman) turns into a psychological obsession for a young woman (Jamie Chung). In West Hollywood, a gay couple (Peter Macdissi/Anson Mount) buys a young African daughter and attempts (unsuccessfully) to mold her to fit their lifestyle. In Holmby Hills, maladjusted kids and their equally maladjusted nanny (Paz Vega) play murderous games. In Sherman Oaks, a rape victim (Zoe Saldana) faces her violator (Nick Stahl) with a revenge all her own. There are lot of other fine actors caught up in this m&eacute;lange but their roles are small.

Depending on your state of mind, these stories border on parody, black humor, sick outlook, and just uninteresting. The things presented as comedy....makes you wonder. Grady Harp, April 14",1398297600,,1681,5.363636363636363
4397296,5,B004KNO798,"Initially, I procrastinated viewing this DVD due to the cover description of the films as ""so twisted, they could only take place in LA"". This made me pause and think they might be too weird for me. However, I am happy to report I was wrong. All five stories, although about ""adult themes"" are very different from each other and fascinating in their own way. The acting is amazing, all have well selected actors and actresses who portray the characters with realism and the right nuance of emotional depth. The films are highly creative and artistic. Each develops an unusual theme, making the viewer feel like they are in a 'twilight zone' where something out of the ordinairy will happen. The viewer is not disappointed, something unexpected always *does* transpire. There is an element of surprise either within the plot, to one or more of the characters, or the ending will have an explosive, bizarre, or very jaw-dropping twist,  all very satisfying and worth viewing. The creative elements and great acting in each film come together and complete the story. The plots are all highly developed and keep the reader mesmerized, hooked, wanting to view the film to the end, despite some trepidations of where it might lead. Any of these films could be shown at a film festival and win an award or get wide viewing because they are so well done.

Mini- Glimpse at what is in store for the viewer for each film:
""The Green-eyed Monster""
Diedre is the fiance of a handsome man whose first wife died. Chloe the daughter comes home from college and Diedre is surprised to discover the close relationship between father and daughter. The relationship borders on the inappropriate.  Jealousy and the feeling of being an outsider begins to eat away at Diedre. There are a myriad of responses and behaviors Diedre could choose to deal with their relationship: if she were confident and secure it could go one way, if she were  shy and introverted it could go another way, if she were insecure and withdrawn it could go another way. This film has an Alfred Hitchcock quality and feel to it. The reader must view it to see where it goes ...
""The Little Piggy""
An attractive coed, is involved in a relationship and agrees to do an unusual physical intimate act. She becomes obessesed with having done it and can't seem to shake the feelings associated with having participated. Her life unravels little by little due to her obsession. There is a bit of dark humor associated with this film. It can be funny if it were not so sad ...
""Buyer's Remorse""
A young African girl is adopted by a gay male couple.  There is culture shock in her adaptation to living in the modern world compared to the more natural state of existence in Africa. At one point, she left here ""girly designed"" bedroom and went to the bushes in the backyard to sleep. Another time at a party in her own backyard, she unexpectedly took a spear, stood like a warrior and threw it at a small animal. The gay couple compares her behavior to that of another male gay couple's daughter who seems to be the epitomy of precocious and above average behavior. How the gay couple deals with her behavior will totally dismay the viewer.
""Kangaroo Court""
Three children are left at home under the care of a nanny, housekeeper, and butler. It is evident they are very wealthy and undisciplined but highly intelligent. They engage in bizarre and scarry games. One of them steals something of great value which belongs to the maid. A court is held where different characters are placed on the witness stand to bring forth the truth about the item stolen. This film was the weirdest and most bizarre, yet it held a Twilight Zone-like fascination and had a shocking, edge of your seat ending.
""Man Eater""
A young woman in her mid to late twenties lives independently in an apartment building. A man dressed in a black outfit, with a cape and white mask breaks into her apartment and forces himself upon her. While cleaning her apartment, she discovers he dropped his wallet. The young woman discovers where he lives and visits, presumably to return the wallet. It all seems unplanned, spur-of-the-moment. She tells the woman who answers a lie, to discover where he works. She visits his workplace which causes him a great deal of anxiety. She lets him know she has his wallet and arranges a meeting during which she acts as if they were on a date. All he wants is to be rid of her and desparately wants to his wallet back which she did *not* bring along. This film develops into a totally unexpected experience and the viewer must view it to discover how the young woman deals with this violator of women.
This DVD is an unusual but fascinating group of films. Recommended if you have been to film festivals and can deal with ""off the wall"", ""twisted"", ""unsual"" themes and subjects. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1372118400,,4853,4.677985948477752

4397299,3,B004KNO798,This movie was a total shocker for me. I watched it with friend one night while have a girls night. I didn't know what to expect when I popped it in. The cover so innocent.

4397300,1,B004KNO798,"I love indie films.  I love the way they make you question what you know.  I love the way they make you empathize with the characters, and I love that they don't always have a happy ending.

This just wasn't one of those films.

The characters were highly needy, but didn't give the viewer a reason to want to empathize.  The stories are interesting, even if they do lack depth.

The movie itself includes high drama in the form of taboo subjects such as sexuality and rape, but it leaves a lot of loose strings as to how the stories are connected, as well as how the characters let the events define them.

Overall, I would say it was dark, with little to no hope or explanation for the characters involved.",1328054400,,708,4.358778625954199
4397301,2,B004KNO798,"It seems like all the movies these days with multiple storylines all tie in together by the end.  Not Burning Palms, it is a true anthology with five completely different stories, there is not even a singular narrator and character that ties them together (though Shannon Doherty shows up twice) and are all introduced in a comic book appropriately entitled Burning Palms.  Even the tone of the segments differs from serious to funny to unintentionally funny.  Really the only similarity between all the segments is that they all follow a character as they go more and more insane.

The Green Eyed Monster features Rosamund Pike (Doom) who meets her future daughter-in-law for the first time and finds out that she has a way too close relationship with her father played by Dylan McDermott (Texas Rangers).  This Little Piggy chronicles Jamie Chung (The Real World: San Diego) who finally agrees to, um, do something in the bedroom that is not that normal, that begins to haunt her.  Buyer's Remorse revolves around a gay homosexual couple ho begin to think they got a lemon... from the adoption agency.  Kangaroo Court follows a group of unruly children who torment the help.  And Maneater see Zoe Saldana (Crossroads) as a victim of sexual assault try to track down her attacker.

As you may have guessed by the segment descriptions, Burning Palms is really only a film for those that like to be shocked.  There is nothing else special about the film once you get past the shock for the sake of shock value.  And if you are not easily shocked all you are left with are five fairly boring stories that just highlight why middle Americans hates people from LA.",1325462400,4,1660,4.769230769230769

The most laughs, by far, came in the vignette depicting a gay couple's experience adopting a child, which in itself is worth the price of the film, although even that vignette was not without its disturbing points.

It plays on fears and stereotypes of what people like Sarah Palin think ""those coastal librals[sic] who are not 'real Americans'"" are like: Sexual deviation.  Gay couples adopting kids.  Unsupervised spoiled rich kids.

O.k., to be honest I lost interest about half way through the film.  I stuck with it, but it wasn't really worth it.  The stories were simply not all that compelling.  The scenes did not set up the situations enough to make me interested in the characters or feel tension in the stories.  Worst of all, the ""twists"" at the end of each little bit were not very clever or satisfying in the way that an episode of the old ""The Twilight Zone"" TV series might be.

First, it's worth noting that the ""movie"" is comprised of five vignettes that are equally strange in turn. There's no apparent connection between them, or coherent plot, theme, or message. Literally, the only two connections is that they're all about sex on some level, and that they all take place in LA. That's about it. It almost feels like the author couldn't think of a coherent story that would run 112 minutes (or probably even 80 minutes), so he or she just decided to write five bad stories, and hope that the brevity would distract us from the dreck.

About the stories: None of them are especially good, and a few of them are blatantly offensive (especially the one featuring a rape). As much as it claims to be darkly satirical, or funny, it really isn't. There was one moment that made me laugh, twisted as it was, but it was mostly devoid of humor, intelligence, meaning, or quality. But it had plenty of awful about it.

I've been a fan of TV shows starring Dylan McDermott, Lake Bell,  Shannen Doherty, and Nick Stahl but none of that seemed to matter past the film's first 5 minutes. It is clear that shock value was going to be the driving force behind this film from the start because there really wasn't anything else of merit going on.

The writing is really where the problem lies. It is just truly terrible. Most of the dialogue seems forced and even  when it doesn't it seems unnatural. None of the characters that share scenes appear to have a genuine relationship with each other and it just all seems fake. I blame this on the writing because I've seen the cast in other films and they haven't been this bad.

Burning palms advertises itself as Crash for perverted people. Instead I think it's just Crash for dumb people. This movie is not entertaining, it goes for laughs the same way films like Meet the Spartans and Vampires Suck due and I personally am not a fan of that kind of humor.

This movie could've been good. The stories aren't so outlandish it disgusting that they wouldn't have worked if somebody intelligent had been behind-the-scenes. But  that was the problem. I don't recommend this film for anyone. Aside from maybe Shannen Doherty, none of these actors are likely to have a cult following. Therefore there's really no excuse see this movie.

Some subject matter is very unsettling, so be warned. The tag line is actually the most accurate one I have ever seen!",1307059200,5,446,4.337349397590361
4397312,4,B004KNO798,"""Burning Palms"" is a graphic novel (i.e., a comic book for adults).  As the pages are flipped by the wind, five stories unfold in this bizarre, extremely sexual anthology .  ""Palms"" are the tropical trees of Los Angeles County, which is the setting for all five tales.  ""But ""palm"" is also a part of the hand from which all five fingers extend outward.  ""Burning"" can describe uncontrollable, perverse lusts or desires which grip numerous characters in this film.

  Expertly directed by Christopher B. Landon (""Disturbia""), ""Burning Palms"" reminded me of Stephen King's ""Creepshow.""  Whereas ""Creepshow"" relied heavily upon gore, ""Burning Palms"" relies upon sex for both shock value and dark humor.  Because of its strong sexual content, it also reminded me of the classic HBO series ""The Hitchhiker,"" which contained a lot of sexual violence; each episode's ending was rather shocking and provocative.

  The huge cast for ""Burning Palms"" is a talented, gorgeous one.  My favorite performer was Lake Bell who portrayed the wisecracking, hippie-looking, acid tripping nanny, Mary Jane.  On numerous occasions, she made me laugh out loud.  Even her name is slang for marijuana.  Her character reminded me of Tipper whom she also portrayed in the hit romantic comedy ""What Happens in Vegas.""

  Zoe Saldana (""Avatar"") gave an emotional tour de force as the distraught rape victim, Sarah Cotton.  Other beautiful actresses who gave outstanding performances as sexual victims are Rosamund Pike (""Surrogates"") and Paz Vega (""Triage"").  The handsome Dylan McDermott (""The Messengers"") gave a great performance as the father, Dennis Marx, whose relationship with his fifteen-year-old daughter Chloe (Emily Meade) borders on incest.

  When I realized that the stories had tragic endings, I began feeling genuine tension and stress as I feared for the safety of the characters.  I stayed up long past my bedtime watching this film; I couldn't turn it off.  The cinematography of beautiful LA and Baton Rouge, combined with a dramatic orchestra soundtrack from composer Matthew Margeson (""The Expendables""), helped make this an enjoyable film.  However, because of the foul language and perverse, graphic sex acts, it is not recommended for children.

  My only complaint is with the DVD release from Image Entertainment.  Surprisingly, there is the absence of special features such as deleted scenes, ""making of"" featurettes and cast/crew interviews.  Thankfully, it has English SDH subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired and is presented in its theatrical widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78:1.

  On the DVD, there is also a trailer for ""Burning Palms"" as well as for numerous other films, which all look intriguing:  In ""The Way Back,"" prisoners who escape a Siberian gulag must traverse 4,000 miles of wilderness; in ""Fall Down Dead,"" a serial killer terrorizes a witness of his latest Satanic murder; in ""A Beautiful Life,"" a runaway struggles to survive on the seedy streets of Los Angeles; and in ""The Killing Jar,"" a group of strangers at a truckstop are taken hostage by a crazed killer.

  ""Burning Palms"" is highly recommended for all fans of bizarre dramas and collectors of strange, frightening anthologies.  Though watching it didn't mess me up for life (at least I hope it didn't), it is a very disturbing film that I won't be able to forget anytime soon.  Kudos to the director, Christopher B. Landon, for his artistic bravery and I hope he plans more shocking, avant-garde anthologies of this nature.

4397313,3,B004KNO798,"Burning Palms is a film made up of 5 short stories. From reading the descriptions, I knew the movie would be a bit on the strange side, but I liked the diverse ensemble of actors involved and knowing it was from the co-writer of Disturbia and Paranormal Activity 2, movies I really enjoyed, I took a chance on it.
The stories range from borderline creepy to deeply disturbing, with a  few funny moments peppered throughout.

The first story, THE GREEN EYED MONSTER,features Dylan McDermott,who I have always liked, as a father with a very close relationship with his 15 year old daughter. So close, in fact, that when she comes home from school to visit, it really disturbs his fiance (Rosamund Pike). She tries to accept what they call a very loving father-daughter relationship, but they seem to take the ""loving"" part a bit farther than what would be considered ""healthy"".

The second, THIS LITTLE PIGGY,features a young woman who ""experiments"" in a sex act with her boyfriend, but afterward starts to slowly come unraveled when she is convinced that she carries an ""essence"" of the act with her everywhere she goes. (That was as polite as I could make that appear)

 Act Three titled: BUYER'S REMORSE is about a gay couple (Peter  Macdissi and Anson Mount) who decide to ""adopt"" a 7 year old girl, only to realize raising a child is not quite as easy as it seems. This is probably the funniest of the stories involved.
It also had, in my opinion, a great title.

The fourth story titled KANGAROO COURT has Lake Bell (It's Complicated, No Strings Attached), who I admit to not really liking before, as a nanny of 3 boys who are left home by their parents with the household help. One of the boys happens upon some secrets about one of the staff members. It also stars Paz Vega (Spanglish), but it is Bell who really makes this selection as a pot-smoking ""hippie-chick"".  performance made me change my opinion of her(in a good way).
This entry is not quite as dark as the others.

The fifth and final chapter is the most disturbing story, MANEATER, and stars Zoe Saldana (AVATAR) as a woman who is raped in her home, and when stumbling upon her attacker's wallet, instead of having him arrested, invites him to her apartment so he can assault her again.

Burning Palms has the tagline ""Five stories that will mess you up for life"". This could definitely apply to some people who watch this movie, if they do not approach it with an open mind and armed with the knowledge of how twisted and perverse the film is. I did indeed find it quiet interesting, but not a film I would highly recommend. The cast (which also inclues Shannon Doherty as a therapist in 2 of the vignettes, does a great job with what they had to work with and Saldana, especially stands out in a role that must have been extremely difficult to play.

As much as I thought it hard to watch at times, I didn't let that stop me and think that some people will enjoy and possibly appreciate this  unique movie.

BE WARNED: this film is dark and twisted at times. It is not for everyone, so be sure you are up for something on this level if you choose it.",1306627200,4,3121,4.51241134751773
