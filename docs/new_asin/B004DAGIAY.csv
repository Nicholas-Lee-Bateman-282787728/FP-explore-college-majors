8425053,5,B004DAGIAY,This guy is a great and patient teacher.  Goes slowly through all the finger motions of fingerstyle.  Good choice of songs progressing from simple to more challenging.  Great!  Wish I knew you in person so you could give my kids regular lessons!!,1521158400,,246,4.785714285714286
8425054,5,B004DAGIAY,"I'm a pretty advanced guitarist in the areas of jazz, rock and blues, but have been trying to learn Travis Picking/Chet Atkins style for the last year on my own.  This DVD is exactly what I was looking for to break everything down and build the necessary skills step-by-step.  I saw one of the reviews critiquing the DVD as being only for more advanced guitarists - I don't really agree with that.  I could have easily made use of this program in my second or third year of playing - the lessons start off a basic level and build up from there.  Excellent method and DVD especially with the closeups of both hands during the lessons.",1455840000,,633,4.431034482758621

8425056,5,B004DAGIAY,"With prior experience on the guitar, I found the lessons to be just the right thing to get beyond strumming and/plucking away in ""faux finger-style"" while working on a more developed technique. The last few pieces are rather difficult, but with over 2 hours of lessons, there is plenty of variety throughout the DVD for players of all levels. Do be sure to contact the author through his site for the PDF with tabs - that helped me a lot. This is one of the better DVDs available on the topic. Recommend.",1402790400,2,504,4.489130434782608
8425057,2,B004DAGIAY,"I've long been searching for a Travis picking dvd that really- and I mean really-- breaks the concept down slowly, specifically and deliberately. In this respect, I have to say: my search continues. Still, this dvd certainly presents a lot of material-- thus, it's a good value in terms of bang for your buck. At least in terms of volume.
  That said, I found you'd have to be an already very accomplished guitar player to move beyond even the 15 to 25 minute mark of this 2 and a half hour dvd. So when he says it's for the ""intermediate player"", that is quite a grand understatement. Really. Apart from the opening few lessons, the term ""intermediate"" is hardly strong enough. Advanced is more appropriate. Often, he plays with a specific technique-- and by this I mean, with a pick for alternating bass notes. (Not always, certainly, but often enough). If you don't, it is suggested that you do it the way that feels most comfortable to you. Not so helpful at all if one is still unsure about how to proceed-- which is why one buys the dvd in the first place. Finding my own way with respect to picking just fuels the confusion. And if I wanted to find my own way, I'd not have picked it up in the first place. Furthermore, if you have difficulty-- slight or otherwise-- with the first 20 minutes or so of the introductory lessons, you are not likely to even see-- much less try to grasp--the next two hours of lessons for decades or more I suspect. (At least I haven't, and consider myself to be an intermediate player, well and truly beyond simply a beginner. But hey, perhaps it's just me).
  In my opinion, I believe this dvd would be far more helpful if the instructor spent more time (and I mean much more time) on a just a few key lessons and core concepts rather than snapshots (at least I felt they were snapshots) on many lessons. I understand that the proceedings must move along in a progression, but I found the leap between lessons to be simply too great.  If you already have significant skill-- and I do mean significant skill-- there is indeed much to learn--possibly-- throughout this dvd, though I suspect if you already have significant skill, you'd likely have no need for this dvd. It is without doubt presented very professionally. But in hopes of learning this style from the ground up, I found this dvd to provide more frustration than inspiration.",1390953600,2,2376,4.555035128805621
