8453947,1,B000034DDQ,"Even for devoted fans of Yukari, this is an awful awful movie.  It is close to unwatchable.  I won't bother with the details of space aliens and swat teams other than to say the story is pathetic.  The production quality is terrible also.  It looks like a high school student project rather than a professional film.  Even if you are a huge Yukari fan you will be sorry to watch this movie.  It is a disgrace.",1049155200,5,409,4.315789473684211
