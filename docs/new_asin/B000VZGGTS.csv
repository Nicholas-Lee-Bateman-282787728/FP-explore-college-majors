8220655,5,B000VZGGTS,"just watched this for the first time and was so pleased to find a film that doesn't play threatening music every time a shark swims into view and actually shows more shark footage than dolphin or sea turtles (in fact, there were no dolphins or turtles featured in this film). a very positive spin on a largely misunderstood and under-observed creature. the only part that seemed out of place was the segue between scenes (didn't quite understand that...budget constraints???) great for any aspiring marine biologist, children and adults alike.",1323561600,2,543,5.112359550561798
8220656,4,B000VZGGTS,I bought this as a gift for my grandson as he is always taking it out of the library.. It is beautifully filmed and filled with information about sharks that is good fooor any age.,1314403200,,180,4.171428571428572
8220657,5,B000VZGGTS,This movie is so informative and great for young kids.  I feel I have a marine biologist in the making now.  My 6 year old grandson has this movie memorized.,1301616000,5,157,4.2
8220658,1,B000VZGGTS,"I checked out this DVD from our library to see if there was anything on it I could use for a class I was teaching about bones and the human body.  I was anticipating something along the lines of how skeletons worked, joints, what bones were made of, perhaps some close-up images of bone marrow, spongy bone, etc.  What I got was a bunch of voodoo history, all sorts of info on superstitions and stories about what cultures present and past do/did with bones.  This included a story about a culture that ceremonially drank from skulls and a husband who stuffed his unfaithful wife's bones in a closet.  Very morbid and freaky.  I don't recommend this DVD to anyone and I certainly wouldn't buy it.",1299888000,12,696,4.536
8220659,1,B000VZGGTS,"This is supposed to be an educational movie on the skeleton.  However, it's more of a history of how people throughout time have been scared of the skeleton.  It talks about Tarot cards, and is spooky from beginning to end.  I'm actually throwing it away.",1299456000,9,255,4.622222222222222
8220660,5,B000VZGGTS,"We had a set of the Eyewitness on VHS and over the years they became distorted and hard to hear.  To have this again in DVD form is priceless.  My kids loved to watch these and actually learned from them.  Martin Sheen does the narrative and his voice is very easy to listen to.  I highly recommend the whole series.  They are short, easy to watch and kids can actually learn while watching TV.",1234915200,15,394,4.27027027027027
