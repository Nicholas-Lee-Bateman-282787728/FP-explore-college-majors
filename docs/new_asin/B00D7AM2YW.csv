5776050,4,B00D7AM2YW,"I love detective series and police procedurals and Line of Duty is the sort of show that PBS would release as Masterpiece Mystery or Masterpiece Contemporary to an appreciative audience.

In Line of Duty, Lennie James plays one of the most respective homicide detectives, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates.  DCI Gates' success draws the attention of their Internal Affairs Department.  Superintendent Ted Hastings is determined to prove that DCI Gates is bent, corrupt, and to expose Gates' misdeeds.  It's not clear whether there's a rational basis behind this investigation or whether Superintendent Hastings is prejudiced against one of the most prominent black policemen.

Superintendent Hastings enlists DS Steve Arnott to handle the investigation against DCI Gates. DS Arnotts comes to Internal Affairs after a botched raid on a terrorist cell.  He carries guilt from the death of an innocent and a determination to prove his strength of purpose and ability.  This focus and his superior's ruthless pursuit of DCI Gates coincides with a difficult period in DCI Gates' personal life.

Line of Duty gives us an emotionally charged, complicated and riveting detective series.  I loved it!",1392595200,,1194,5.376344086021505
5776051,5,B00D7AM2YW,"Well acted, great plot twists with enough gritty suspense and thriller-like aspects to keep you dialed in!  Line of Duty: Series 1 is a wonderful introduction to us on the other side of the pond to this British TV series launched in 2012.  Good cops, bad cops... all the stuff that we like with a hardcore edge that probably wouldn't make it on prime time in the US due to language.

Line of Duty is smart, well written and acted, and engages your sensibilities.  Definitely worth checking out, and may be available on Netflix (was awhile ago, but currently unavailable for streaming).

5776052,4,B00D7AM2YW,Lennie James is excellent in this Good Cop gone a stray story. But his character is not the only one that's playing with fire and not trying to get burn in this psychological thriller. Now I know that there have too be a Series 2 in the work's.,1391385600,,244,4.104166666666667
5776053,3,B00D7AM2YW,"DCI Tony Gates is a high-flier in the police department: his squad has outstanding crime statistics; his charismatic leadership inspires loyalty (to a fault) among his squad; and his beautiful wife and children are icing on the cake. The only cloud in Gates's sky is his extra-marital relationship with a cunning businesswoman, a relationship from which Gates tries to extricate himself. But the woman is loath to let him go, and not simply for reasons of love. She has invested her body and money to cultivate a relationship with someone in law enforcement who can do her favors, and she means to get a return on her investment. You know Gates's relationship with this woman is going to prove to be a big problem and that his efforts to deal with her likely will pull him into deeper water. The setup to this point is promising and plausible. And, then, for me, plausibility was jettisoned. [spoiler alert!] The girlfriend is killed in Gates's presence by masked thugs who knock Gates unconscious, press a knife into his hand to get his fingerprints on it, and cart her body away to be refrigerated against the day it, and the knife, will be turned over to police if Gates doesn't do the bidding of the mysterious criminal mastermind behind all this, who gives Gates orders over cell phones conveyed to Gates by a mouthy, adolescent hoodlum on a bicycle. (No, I'm not making this up.) In the meantime, the equivalent of Internal Affairs begins investigating Gates's connection to his girlfriend, now missing. Between that investigation and the demands of the mysterious criminal mastermind, Gates soon finds himself pushed to increasingly desperate measures to keep his universe from collapsing in on him. What's a guy to do? I didn't really care. There's graphic violence and heaping doses of cynicism (there's no one among the police rank and file who would snitch on criminal behavior of a fellow officer, and there's no one in police leadership who's not a politician first and a police officer second). I'm okay with such things in the service of a plausible story. This is not such a story.",1390435200,2,2097,4.844011142061281
5776054,5,B00D7AM2YW,"Great series.  Love british crime thrillers and have seen alot.  This is a really good one.  Somewhat like Trial and Retribution with interesting character development, no excessive violence, well acted and some not so obvious twist and turns.  Cannot wait until Series 2 is available.",1383955200,,285,5.266666666666667

5776056,1,B00D7AM2YW,"I received this as a gift. I fully expected to like it as I am a big fan of  ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Cracker"". I disliked everything about this. Ridiculous, implausible plot; gratuitous, sickening violence; and thoroughly unlikable characters.",1383436800,9,240,5.315789473684211

5776092,5,B00D7AM2YW,"If you only watch one British crime
drama, watch this series.

 Each series is as compelling as the last and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Deeply flawed characters with lines so blurred between the good guys and the bad guys you realise no one is above the law and no one obeys the law.

Series five is being shot this year for release in 2019 so plenty of time to binge this gem.",1517097600,,386,4.052631578947368
5776093,5,B00D7AM2YW,"Very intense.  Different from most British detective shows in terms of pace and rawness.  Plot lines are really solid and the acting is superb.

5776124,3,B00D7AM2YW,"I watched this first series several years ago but didn't watch the rest of the series. This summer when in England there was a lot of media coverage when the latest series was broadcast so I watched the first series again; I wasn't wrong! The acting and suspense is good but after 5 episodes it finished in a very unsatisfactory way which is why I never bothered with the rest of the series. Too far fetched, very violent, and so proper ending. I prefer other crime series from the UK such as Scott and Bailey, Inspector Lewis, Vera.",1498608000,,533,4.448979591836735
5776125,5,B00D7AM2YW,Another great British TV show. I watch the first season DVD and am guessing each season has one central case that goes the entire season until resolution much like the British series Whitechapel or Showtime's Dexter. The series was well acted and I mostly watched several episodes at one sitting as it was that riveting that you wanted to see what came next in the following episode. I will definitely purchase future season DVDs of this series.,1497744000,,445,4.792207792207792

5776130,1,B00D7AM2YW,"SPOILERS!  I just finished Season 1.  Excellent premise, wonderful acting and great three dimensional characters.  Unfortunately, the most unsatisfying ending I've seen in a long time.  I really dislike ""Happily Ever After"" endings but this finale seemed to prove the entire season was a waste of time for all investigators involved.  A thoroughly depressing ending does not make the series edgy or realistic.",1494979200,,409,5.428571428571429
5776131,5,B00D7AM2YW,This is literally the best police procedural on the planet. You'll think you'll you know what's going on then in EP 02 you're lost. Then it all comes together. It's good if you like this kind of show. Really good.,1494892800,,213,4.35

It's a good crime story that, for many hours of viewing, gets you emotionally involved with the characters - and not always in a good way.  In the past I've not been a fan of British movies and TV, but this is about the 5th or 6th set of story lines that I've purchased recently, and I have not been disappointed in any of them. Clearly, the quality of British-produced TV has greatly improved and, in my opinion, is now better than much of what is being produced for American TV.",1484265600,,668,4.1953125

These constantly detract from the story which by itself is convoluted and bears listening to follow.  I will admit that I have some difficulty hearing at my age and after almost 40 years of loud noises, shots fired, and explosives, I still have not fully learned the languages of the isles. Still, the actions of the officers and generally insulting behavior would not be acceptable in my past affiliations with both national and international agencies.

5776190,5,B00D7AM2YW,"This is one of the most outstanding police.crime series I've seen in a while. The characters are fully realized and the good guys are just as layered and ambiguous as the bad guys are.  It follows the career of an idealistic young officer who is leading a raid on an apartment; a simple yet easily avoidable mistake causes the death of the wrong man.  He is moved to the Anti Corruption unit of the force and begins the investigation.  Initially the investigation of a senior officer is a minor issue; he did not report that a member of the public covered an inexpensive restaurant tab.  But from there he discovers that Anti Corruption is looking much deeper than that.  The twists and turns of the plot, the gray shadings and moral/ethical questions are fascinating to watch.  It's also a look at modern policing methods in Britain that frequently leaves officers on the street with little or no recourse to deal with the most common problems the citizens face.",1478131200,,963,4.7023809523809526

The kidnapping of a police officer by drug dealers was not realistic, it seemed to be put in to adhere to crime drama conventions. The officer wouldn't have gone to the spot where he was kidnapped without backup, and law enforcement takes off the gloves when one of their own is in that kind of danger.

5776264,4,B00D7AM2YW,"Very good show although the AC unit cops are completely obnoxious and often inept. Tony Gates is arrogant and entitled but is a great character, however I would've enjoyed the series more if the AC unit cops had a shred of personality. They're worse than some of the robots on Law and Order. Also it's funny how they can just tell their boss that they won't listen to him and he basically just thanks them for ignoring him. Honestly though it's still a very good show.
Series 2 is even better until the end, which is terrible. They arrest and convict the wrong person with almost no evidence whatsoever. She doesn't even admit to anything either.. Seems like they hit the point where it needed to end and slapped some contrived ending together just to comply with the required duration. Or perhaps just couldn't come up with an ending that made any sense... Sometimes the story can get so complex that the writers back themselves into a corner and have to tie it all together with a terrible ending just to not contradict the events of the twists and subplots.  Well directed though and fun to watch, I'd recommend this show even with it's frustrating holes and good guys that constantly irritate me. It's just not a show where I root for the good guys, and the worst of the bad guys always get away free at the end.",1468108800,,1316,4.506276150627615

Wow - gripping, edge of your seat, cannot wait for the next episode, great acting, great writing. That is how I describe this series, but I'm still watching series 1. Yeah, it's different than Broadchurch but why would you want to see the same thing? LoD uses a different angle - anti corruption, or AC as the British call it. A simple gratuity accepted but unreported by a senior dective, a man who has an impecible record, who is literally cop-of-the-year, slowly but surely expands, bit by bit, into a major corruption scandal. Good cop versus bad cop. More than Serpico. Twists, turns that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud, this is a no-brainer, walk-off grand slam. I'm watching this series on Hulu plus. Incidentally, I use the subtitles because of the various British accents.",1458000000,,807,4.855072463768116

The series centers on a police unit that investigates other police officers, so it is not surprising that some ""bad"" cops will appear. However, virtually every officer is corrupt or incompetent (the few who are not provide victims)  Moreover, there is a serious lack of discpline-- ""bad"" cops freely assault the investigators. The series resembles the old time serials which ended each episode with a cliffhanger. So, enjoy the show, but don't imagine it has much to do with reality.",1454457600,,552,5.065934065934066

5776351,1,B00D7AM2YW,"Agree with Yellow Iris! Stupid and horrible show. It started with cops lies and ended with cops lies when Arnott and Fleming said that the unscrupulous Gates was killed in traffic chasing on foot. This show illustrates that the number of good cops are far outnumbered by the number of bad cops. This show contained prejudicial comments and actions against the down syndrome individual who was treated as ""stupid"" by the lazy female police officer who was more interested in keeping the qoutas and stats in order. Then, the two supervising officers who, in the restaurant, used the derogatory phrase ""I was beginning to think that I was the ginger stepson (ie ... unwanted). This type of script writing perpetuates bullying and hatred. If the writers had said anything about blacks, jews or homosexuals, they would have been forced to apologize and been crucified by such groups. But if you are a minority within the so-called majority ( ie. Caucasian race) such as  being a ""ginger"" or Down Syndrome or if you are overweight or have a stutter, you do not fall victim to so called hate crimes such as the groups mentioned above, so film and series writers feel licensed to perpetuate discrimination and hate.

5776375,5,B00D7AM2YW,"This is one of the best shows in the Britcop genre I've seen, and I have watched a lot of police-themed shows from both sides of the pond for years!!! I'll admit that I can't quite get my American brain around police not carrying guns in reality, but from a completely artistic viewpoint, I think it's one of the things that makes Line of Duty work so well. The story builds from small moments in character relationships and actions, but there are plenty of gasper twists from unexpectedly intricate connections and stomach-lurching action driven by lives spraying out of control in ways every bit as dangerous and captivating as massive shootouts! The only criticism I really have is that Philip Glenister and John Simm aren't anywhere in the all-star cast, but the way that they use the many other big-name actors we've seen in other shows in very different character roles is a strength that almost makes up for that. In series 2, Keeley Hawes has no glamour at all to help sell Lindsay Denton, whose physical transformation episode to episode would almost work for a Walking Dead spin as a zombie, but she holds you completely riveted, unable to look away. So, hopefully she will be appearing again in the future series already ordered...and please, oh please, bring her hubby to work with her!",1439164800,6,1298,4.773333333333333

5776386,5,B00D7AM2YW,"On the picture here is the true star of this series. The character is a London police inspector named Tony Gates. He is played by Lennie James who covers every aspect, both good and bad, of this character. By the end of the fifth episode I felt horribly conflicted over his character and that is quite a compliment. The usual way in a drama is someone is wonderful and someone else is horrible and there is nothing in between. Well, real life rarely works like that and that is what this series is like, real life.

What gets the story going is that another policeman, Arnott, is transferred to the anti-corruption unit and he's to see if the much vaunted Tony Gates, with the highest solve rate among all detectives, is really a bad cop. His boss fears that he is. A woman policewoman goes to work for Gates and tries to infiltrate his real setup from that angle. This is Fleming. Fleming and Arnott have to do some very dangerous things to ascertain if Tony Gates is dirty or not so there is a lot of edge of your seat actionl.

But Lennie James is just so wonderful as Tony Gates that he makes the whole thing.

5776439,5,B00D7AM2YW,"British television series Line of Duty bravely explores the world of modern-day policing and the mistakes that good  and not-so-good  cops make in both their personal and professional lives.  Tautly written and superbly acted, the series offers some of the most challenging and gripping television Ive ever seen.

At Series 1 opens, DS Matthew Arnott (Martin Compston) is the on-site officer in charge of a raid on a reported suicide bomber holed-up in an apartment block.  The intelligence is sketchy, the police do not have a clear view of the suspect, and Arnott is under tremendous pressure from his superiors to launch the raid lest the man blow himself and innocent bystanders to pieces.  Reluctantly, he gives the go-ahead.  The results a disaster: the intelligence was wrong and an innocent man is shot dead.  Arnotts superiors disavow his actions and pressure him to protect his team and the police by helping to cover up the blunders.  Alone among those involved, Arnott refuses to lie, and is transferred to AC-12, the anti-corruption squad charged with investigating officers suspected of collusion with criminals.

The series opener does a brilliant job of laying out the complex and morally ambiguous world in which police operate today.  In effect, cops are supposed to make the right decision every time at a moments notice where a mistake can be tragic and every action taken  or not taken  is subject to scrutiny and investigation, all the while knowing that the criminals they pursue have absolutely no limits and answer to no one.  Arnott knows he gave the wrong order, and he is painfully aware that he and his team  who for all the right reasons did what they were ordered to do  will pay the price if he doesnt bend the truth.  He also knows that his superiors will never acknowledge their own culpability and will cover up the mistakes they made that directly led to the disaster.  The real truth will almost certainly never come out, so whats the right thing to do?  Tell the absolute truth and damage the lives and careers of his men, or support them and betray his code and his conscience?

Arriving at AC-12, Arnott is quickly drawn into an investigation of DCI Tony Gates, the charismatic head of an outstanding squad which has developed a record of closing cases that is second to none.  A devoted family man with a happy marriage and two young daughters, Gates is set to receive his third Officer of the Year award and has come under the scrutiny of AC-12 apparently only because his record just seems too good to be true.  As Arnott and his colleagues scrutinize the cases cleared by Gates and his fiercely loyal squad, troubling irregularities surface, including possible evidence that the squad has been laddering cases  getting criminals they have apprehended to plead guilty to multiple offenses involving open cases in exchange for favorable sentencing  to improve their case closure record.  And perfect family man and super cop DCI Gates has been having an affair with Jackie Laverty (Gina McKee), his one-time fiance until she dumped him and married her now-deceased wealthy property developer husband.  Gates has always loved Jackie and when she calls him a panic because she was driving under the influence and says she hit a dog, he reluctantly agrees to help her cover it up by having her claim her car was stolen.  Only it isn't a dog that she hit, and it may not have been an accident at all.  With AC-12 closing in, Gates desperately tries to extricate himself from the mess hes in.  Is he in fact a corrupt cop with ties to organized crime?  Or is he a fundamentally decent man and good cop who is has been used and manipulated by the woman he loved and thought he knew?

The success of Line of Duty lies in the fact that it refuses to take the easy way with any of its characters.  No matter how upright and by the book they appear to be, all of the cops are in fact very human with real weaknesses and failings, operating in a justice system that demands they obey every rule in the book and leaves them vulnerable to and accountable for the failings of those with whom they work and live.  There are plenty of twists and turns that keep us guessing throughout the series, and the actors and writers do a brilliant job of creating nearly unbearable tension as the show draws to a close.  Sympathetic to good men and women for whom a single mistake or bad choice can lead to an avalanche of trouble, Line of Duty challenges viewers to ask themselves how well their own lives would fare under the spotlight.",1410652800,3,4555,4.69521410579345

5776441,5,B00D7AM2YW,"LINE OF DUTY is being hailed as arguably the best cop show of all time. While it is perhaps too soon to make that judgment (after all, longevity should be part of the consideration) this reviewer found it gripping, enthralling and highly original. The perspective the show takes is ""who polices the police"" and while I am not a police basher by any means, it has been proven again and again (unfortunately) that sometimes corruption happens where it simply shouldn't. Thus the need for internal investigations, sometimes even of the most respected law enforcers.

Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates is one of the best--according to his record. But does that make him suspicious? Superintendent Ted Hastings, the head of police anti-corruption unit, thinks so. What unfolds is a fascinating roller coaster ride of did he or didn't he, how could this or that happen and what's it all about, Alfie.

The only drawback to this powerful five episode drama is the overuse of shaky camera work, especially in action scenes. We've seen this all before and it is nauseating. Fortunately the show is otherwise so good that these over the top moments are soon forgotten.

Former professional footballer (soccer) Martin Compston has made a remarkable transition from one profession to another and is excellent as DS Steve Arnott, the anti-corruption officer front and centre for most of the game. He is matched by the extraordinarily beautiful Vicky McClure as his partner on the case. (Oh, those blue eyes! Cerulean pools to die for...)

Like many of the edgier shows on British television there is a modicum of sex and bad language. This is mentioned out of respect for those who factor such things into their viewing hours.

LINE OF DUTY was a huge hit when it premiered. It is easy to see why. And guess what, Series Two is even better... And the show is still in production at the time of this writing... Isn't it great to be left wanting more?

This is precisely the kind of show that leaves its mark on you in that way.",1408665600,4,2016,4.778735632183908

Summarizing while avoiding spoilers is an art, and it's one that I was a little shocked to see eluded two of the other reviewers who appear on the listing page. And that's a shame, because spoilers could easily ruin the pleasure of this taut and VERY suspenseful investigation by ""internal affairs"" of possible rule-breaking or worse by a highly placed officer who has just won a prestigious award. Lennie James plays the character under investigation to perfection, alternately showing us his charm, his genuine warmth, his charismatic leadership and his arrogance, and more generally making my husband and me, as we watched, alternate between believing that the internal affairs team were the ones in the wrong for focusing much too hard on petty issues that should be overlooked in an officer of such obvious talent, then suddenly fearing for the safety of those the young internal affairs officers, only to somersault around again. Fun to talk about as we forced ourselves to parcel out the episodes. To write such a finely nuanced character study in five episodes would be triumph enough, but for Jed Mercurio to combine that with such a gripping ""did-he-or-didn't-he mystery is a real tour de force. Did sensitive viewers have to ""avert their eyes""? Really? Okay, well, each to his own, but we didn't and we aren't especially fond of violence. Then again, one of our favorite American shows of the past decade is Hannibal, and because that is so intelligent, with nearly all the violence happening off-screen, we don't avert our eyes from it either, and for the sheer intelligence of a complex show created by a gifted show-runner, this sometimes reminded me of Hannibal. But on the other hand, for sheer addictive watch-ability it also reminded us of the (Danish versions) of The Killing and Bron/Broen (The Bridge), so I was quite surprised to see that a reviewer here compares it unfavorably to precisely those amazing shows. I was also startled that more than one reviewer complained that no character is ""likable,"" whereas for me, by the end, I understood most of the  characters on both sides so well that I liked virtually everyone, including those revealed by the end to be less than admirable. There were two exceptions, but to say more about that would definitely be a spoiler, and moreover one was someone I liked most of the way through, making for another mystery/ surprise.

5776450,5,B00D7AM2YW,"This is wonderful stuff, but not for the faint of heart.  DCI Tony Gates (Lennie James) has just received an officer-of-the-year award for his closing of cases.  The AC (anti-corruption) unit is skeptical.  Has Tony been laddering (i.e. multiplying the charges with each case so that the closure numbers skew skyward)?

This is the least of Tonys problems.  A happily-married man with two daughters on whom he dotes, Tony is irresistibly drawn to a wealthy woman who lusts after him (and the good he can do her within the force).  She is corrupt, a property owner/manager in league with a drug ring which uses her properties to launder money.  Tony is investigating a triple murder involving rival dealers and has not yet seen that all of these activities are connected and all, ultimately, involve him.

And herein lies the drama.  We have a great copper who is also a human being, drawn into a circle of corruption by his human inclinations, but protective of his honor, integrity and, in particular, his family.  The AC unit (cf. internal affairs in the U.S.) is hounding him; the villains are hounding him; he is tormented by his complicity in crime but determined to do the right thing and close the case, even if this will come at a significant cost.

Thus, the story concerns honor and ultimately very few individuals in the force and in the world that they investigate possess it or value it.  The corruption, finally, is omnipresent.

The writing and pacing are superb.  This is riveting, personal drama along with gruesome and gritty action.  The villains trademark, e.g., is the severing of fingers with a set of bolt cutters and a little dismemberment of full bodies causes them little loss of sleep.  They are hateful to the core and the shadowy presence that directs their activities (Tommy) is a disembodied voice on a series of burner cellphones.

Nearly all of the principal characters are compromised in some way and their attempt to do the right thing while wallowing in a cesspit of corruption makes for heartbreaking drama.

This is all exacerbated by the nature of contemporary British policing.  The bureaucrats and the time-servers are in full command and the honest, determined coppers are hamstrung by regulations and administrative risk-aversion.

I look forward to the second series (the first: 5 one-hour segments).  At this point I am prepared to rank this among the very best of the ensemble-cast British crime series.  Do not miss it.",1405468800,3,2466,4.905797101449275

5776454,4,B00D7AM2YW,"BOTTOM LINE: Worth it to see an excellent performance by Lennie James but series may not be what you expect.

Lennie James as Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates may bring many viewers to Line of Duty but unfortunately he is featured less in the series than he is on the DVD cover art. Viewers spend a lot of time with the other two cast members in the image, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, and their characters are easy to dislike. A lot.

Similarly, only at the beginning and end of the series do you get to see Gates be as dynamic and clever as one would assume he would have to be to warrant so much attention from the forces focused on him. Most of the rest of the time viewers may wonder how someone with so much skill and experience could have so little instinct that so many people get to take a bite out of him. Sometimes fewer episodes along with the longer running time works out well for BBC dramas because each episode is so richly packed. This time the limit works against the series because it feels like so much of the story is missing.

Line of Duty series 1 is worth picking up just for James' deep performance but it would have been more enjoyable if the character he was given to play was as good, bad, brilliant or all of the above as one might have hoped and expected.

Tony Gates (Lennie James) is a veteran cop; brash, confident, with a cadre of almost-sycophantic ;underlings that he trusts implicitly - and a closet skeleton that he wants to keep hidden. Gates also has the best 'solved' record in the department. So, of course, Internal Affairs targets him. Nobody is THAT good.

Arnott, after his sensationalized blunder, is reassigned to Internal Affairs, where he will be effectively out of the public eye. Kate Fleming is also recruited to infiltrate Gates' loyal little unit, to scope out whatever dirt she can find about him. And as things turn out, it happens that the infidelity that Gates is trying to keep hidden has far more behind it than a quick fling.

Engrossing and dark, tightly written and absorbing, 'Line of Duty' draws the viewer into a slimy underbelly of London crime that slowly expands into a vast stinking cesspool of personnel and events. Certainly none of the law-enforcement components of this tale have any idea at the beginning of the scope of the matter, nor how everything is connected; and the viewer is torn between disgust over Gates' weakness in getting involved in something he could easily - and with prudence - have avoided, and a certain degree of sympathy for him as he struggles desperately to conjure up a way out of his predicament.

British crime dramas represent some of the best writing of the genre, and 'Line of Duty' is no exception. The viewer can identify with each protagonist, and one comes away from viewing this with the feeling that the audience has been treated with respect and a regard for intelligence. This is not dumbed-down at all for the casual viewer completely ignorant of police procedure; you are along for the ride, and the excellence of the writing makes it a thrilling ride.

British TV has gotten quite grim and graphic in the last couple of decades, as seen in this taut, tense police thriller about a celebrated English police detective under investigation for possible corruption and tampering with evidence. This five-part series features a strong cast of actors (all little known to American eyes, which I for one find to be a plus) portraying complex characters, each morally challenged to different degrees by the tensions between professional duty and real-world efficiency, where crime stats often interfere with crime fighting. Like HBO's ""The Wire,"" or ""Prime Suspect,"" ""Luther,"" and other modern British cop shows, this is a dark, frequently upsetting drama, slowly ratcheting up from uncomfortable ethical dilemmas to gruesome, almost nauseating violence. It's quite well written, very well acted and impeccably produced. Highly recommended, though perhaps not for the faint of heart.

He is sent to the anitcoruption unit where he is to investigate the cop of the year, DCI Tony Gates played by Lennie James.  Gates squad has the best clearance stats of any group.  But they get that by cherry picking high profile cases and cases that appear to be easily solved.  Additionally, they charge the criminals with as many crimes as possible to make it look like more crimes were solved (known as Laddering).  But this is really just the side story.

The meat of this mini-series is how a basically decent cop and family man gets caught up in a money launderng scam with the town's drug kingpin.  While Gates is just an unknowing pawn in the scheme, it is interesting how quickly he slides into the muck to protect himself and his family.

If the show was just about this, it would be a fantastic show but it gets caught up in the precinct politics and often goes off on tangents that never mount up to much.

Crimes in the scarily dystopian neighborhood around the police station are investigated, but that is not the focus of the plot.  Rather, the plot focuses on the dramas inside the police station as they relate to Detective Chief Inspector Gates.  Although he is a very successful investigator, Gate's cool exterior hides cracks which are being investigated by internal affairs.  The relentless hunt by DS Steve Arnott of internal affairs begins to wear down Gates and to leads him to act rashly, further expositing himself to outside forces.

The plot of Line of Duty spans all of the episodes rather than each episode standing alone.  The pace of the action is methodical as the tension and stakes are raised higher with each new development.  The plot is dark with murders, corruption and the decay of society.  We see a police force both with brilliant, driven officers, and those who are more interested in holding others back and retributions.  Those officers who want to improve their departments statistics and those who want to actually work the streets.

The acting is fantastic.  It is easy to feel sorry for the DS Steve Arnott who feels the guilt of leading a botched raid and his quiet drive to take down DCI Tony Gates.  It is easy to dislike the swagger of Gates even before learning more about him and the multiple layers of his persona.  He is the brilliant police detective, the devoted family man and the man accused of corruption and worse.

5776468,4,B00D7AM2YW,"I've come to expect that most police procedural thrillers will be implausible, but sometimes they go straight from there to unwatchable. The problem is fitting into 1 hour episodes a concise story about solving crimes. This is more like a long movie though, with 5 hours to fit in a story that lacked plausibility but made up for it in complexity.

The most compelling character in the story was Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Tony Gates, played very nicely by Lennie James. He's the most developed character. He means well but keeps getting himself in deeper and deeper trouble. The rest of the characters don't get quite as much attention because the focus is on the crimes being solved and on the destruction of DCI Gates.

I think they tried to develop Detective Sergeant Arnott, but he just wasn't actually that interesting except in how he dealt with DSI Gates.

Ethically driven police officer is involved in a raid that ends in tragic consequences but rather than sing with the choir of what we may refer to on this side of the pond as the ""thin blue line,"" he is committed to doing the right thing resulting in his immediate relegation to the anti-corruption division, the British version of the Internal Affairs Department where he is assigned to investigation of a highly decorated yet inarguably arrogant detective squad leader suspected of ""laddering"" crime statistics, i.e., manipulating charges to make his case closure rates look phenomenal.  But, like peeking into the vanity closet in a new acquaintance's powder room and discovering a whole lot of tubes of some pretty unsettling ointments, it rapidly becomes clear the renowned and respected Chief Inspector has been screwing around with appreciably more than crime statistics. Comprised of five episodes spanning two disks, the serialized drama hastily progressed to a somewhat equivocal conclusion. The second disk also includes a bonus features section that I had no motivation to watch.

<End of short attention span review>

My curiosity was sparked when I noticed Lennie James, who I liked in his featured role as a brooding, mysterious and secretive operative in the abbreviated post-apocalyptic U.S. drama Jericho, appeared to be the lead actor. After this outing, I'm going to have to look for other programs where he has a significant part because based on his performance here there's little indication his range is all that expansive although neither the plotting nor dialogue gave him much of a shot.

Also playing a major role here is actress Vicky McClure who might not be a Helen Mirren but she has impressed me as a curvier, more emotive Courteney Cox, which is a good thing.  However, as there is a second season of the series it appears actor Martin Compston, the AC12 investigator with the non-equivocal moral compass is the real star.  Good for him, I've seen enough.

I have come across numerable British series I have found to be outstanding however unless you are hypnotized or intoxicated by the mere whisper of a British accent in a television program as though inflection and pronunciation automatically convey quality and value, this set of DVDs can be passed by without concern. With the first two episodes, it is possible to give the series the benefit of doubt but beyond that point, whatever cohesiveness may have existed was hatcheted by wooden acting, shaky camera work and a dearth of plausibility.",1393632000,2,2569,5.071090047393365

That's the most basic summary, anyway.  There are many, many supporting characters, each with their own interests in the case. In fact that's one criticism I have of the series: too large a cast, too many subplots. The entire show is only five 60-minute episodes, so there's not a huge amount of time for all these bit players to develop their stories properly, and the overall effect is somewhat distracting.

But the main storyline is compelling, and from one episode to the next the sense of higher and higher stakes building up as the situation spirals out of control will keep most viewers coming back.

A couple of technical issues that get in the way: the camera work is a bit dodgy in a few places, though it's perfectly respectable overall.  The dialogue can be a bit hard to follow as well. I watch a lot of British TV and generally don't have any trouble following along, but in this case a combination of nonstandard accents, slangy vocabulary, and police jargon does get in the way of my comprehension. I might compare it to the difference between the way American characters talk in a mainstream show like Big Bang Theory, and in an oddball show like Duck Dynasty--conceptually, at least.",1393632000,,1471,4.752941176470588
5776471,4,B00D7AM2YW,Don't know what it is about Lennie James that makes me want to see everything he's in.  This show is OK but there's some real cheese like the villain who's always on a cell phone stereotypical baddy.  4 stars,1393632000,,208,4.3076923076923075
5776472,4,B00D7AM2YW,"Line of Duty: Series One is a crime drama produced by the BBC.  The show stars Martin Compston as Detective Sgt. Steve Arnott, who is sent to the anti-corruption unit and is given a special assignment, investigate Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates (Lennie James) and his unit.  Gates is a highly decorated officer along with his division.  But his superiors suspect everything is not as it seems.  Arnott discoveries will take him on a journey through several layers of craziness that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Acorn Media presents the first series on a two disc DVD set.  Included are all five episodes and a collection of featurettes that includes interviews with the cast & crew along with behind the scenes footage.  I really enjoyed the acting and direction.  Lennie James co-stars as the complex D.C.I. Tony Gates and I enjoy the way he portrayed the character.  A good guy who's decisions and actions over the years has led him the wrong path.

I have to highly recommend this for people who enjoy crime dramas and BBC productions.",1393459200,,1056,4.752747252747253
5776473,4,B00D7AM2YW,"I love British television.  I find their dramas to be intelligent, well written and acted with a sense of maturity often found lacking in American television.  That holds true with this, the beginning of the excellent crime series LINE OF DUTY.  Characters are deeply drawn and the plot and strong atmosphere pulled me in from the very beginning.  British crime shows often manage to bring about intensity, suspense and fear merely through the dialogue and acting.  This series is the first British one I've seen to have extreme graphic violence and it works.  The combination of it with the well crafted characters and story line makes the show that much more mesmerizing and addictive. Highly recommend.",1393372800,,705,5.0344827586206895
5776474,4,B00D7AM2YW,"This is series 1 of a British police drama. It does grab you from the 1st swat type unit moving into an apartment shooting a man holding a baby.
British television does not normally have the blatant violence that appears on American television, but this is an exception to that rule. The storyline deals mainly with the anti-corruption unit trying to find evidence on Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates who is considered the best in the city. There are twists and turns regarding most of the characters that appear. Some things do not add up at the end regarding certain actions. Still this is a good series for those who enjoy drama and especially police suspense and mystery.

There are 2 discs with 6 episodes, a total of 305 minutes, plus 47 minutes of extras and 10 minutes of behind the scenes. Subtitles for the hard of hearing are also included.",1393286400,,855,4.662251655629139
5776475,5,B00D7AM2YW,"First, let me say I am usually not a fan of british police procedurals. Line Of Duty had me entranced in the first few minutes and I could not wait to watch.  The drama is layered with three dimensional characters. The plot speeds through some awesome twists and turns.  You can never be quite sure how anything will turn out. Every character seems to have their own agenda and no one is what they seem to be.  This show runs 5 episode but each one is packed and leaves the viewer wanting more.  Great script and plot, great characters and actors, this is a winner.",1393200000,,565,4.352380952380952
5776476,5,B00D7AM2YW,"My husband and I are a big fan of British TV programs: Sherlock, Downton Abbey, Doctor Who are just a few that we eagerly watch. So when the chance came to get this series, I got it despite not knowing much about it. Suffice to say, I am pleased with the decision as the series turned out to be very good!

One of the things I liked was the subtlety in the plotting. There wasn't constant action or constant intrigue. Villains and heroes were not always obvious. The acting was top notch and the pacing was perfect for me. I also liked that the season was complete. The main storyline is resolved and you're not left dangling at the end.

The benefit of watching this on DVD as opposed to Hulu, for me, was the ability to have subtitles. Despite watching a fair amount of British shows, I still don't catch many idioms and phrases because Im either not familiar with them, or the actors speak faster than I can hear. Thats when I cherish the subtitle feature. That way, I don't feel like I am missing anything. Also there are special features where you can see how they filmed the series, and there are interviews with the cast that are added bonuses.

In all, my husband and I both enjoyed this series very much and are looking forward to season 2!",1393200000,,1249,4.375
5776477,5,B00D7AM2YW,"I thoroughly enjoyed Series 1 of Line of Duty.  As a fan of British TV I had high expectations given the reviews I'd read and I wasn't disappointed.  The series revolves around an Internal Affairs investigation of a decorated officer and there are ample twists and turns that will keep your attention throughout each of the five episodes.  I particularly like that the director brought an end to the story line (albeit with a new beginning) but it's refreshing to see a plot wrapped up in so few episodes vs. getting strung along for season after season as is typical of most U.S. tv series.  Lennie James does a fabulous job as DCI Gates, the officer under investigation.  It's unclear at times just how guilty Gates may be but one thing that is clear is he's a master manipulator of his co-workers, family and friends.  And he's fun to watch.

The series is a bit dark so be prepared for some intensely violent scenes.  It's definitely not for you if you're uncomfortable with graphic crime scenes and occasional profanity.  But if you enjoy a crime drama and like twists and turns along the way you will enjoy this one.  A suggestion:  take advantage of the subtitling.  The language (more the local language than the accents) can be tough to follow sometimes so the subtitles are a big help.  One final comment:  there are bonuses on disk 2 but they are mostly interviews with the directors and cast.  There are some behind the scenes shots but those are really just a peek at the sets with unamplified dialogue.  I'd have preferred additional extra content but the lack of it didn't lower my opinion or rating of this series.",1393113600,,1630,4.627177700348432
5776478,4,B00D7AM2YW,"As a fan of British police procedurals and crime dramas for years, I'm the kind of person who will pick up anything that falls within this genre, sight unseen; to me, even if it's bad, it's good. There's no quibble about whether ""Line of Duty"" is good or not, though: it's terrific.  Lennie James (from the films Snatch, 24 Hour Party People, and the TV shows ""Walking Dead,"" ""Jericho"" and ""Low Winter Sun,"" among others) is unabashedly great as DCI Tony Gates. Adrian Dunbar, who was ubiquitous in the 1990s and who I now periodically wonder what's happened to, makes an appearance as Superintendent Hastings, and the rest of the supporting cast is quite good. It's a gritty, sometimes graphic police drama, plenty of tension both on and off the job. There are some credulity issues here, plot lines where it's difficult to suspend belief, but my biggest beef, which I will be vague about as to avoid spoilers, is the frequent use of the old-fashioned noir ""dames ain't nothing but trouble"" trope. It's such a modern story that the trope seems out of place, and used in such a way that it feels like they had trouble writing the female characters. All in all, however, this is definitely worth checking out, and I'm keen to see the second series.",1392854400,,1247,4.668181818181818
5776479,5,B00D7AM2YW,"The first season of Line of Duty a British Cops Drama/Thriller is produced by Acorn Media (who produced some other great shows such as Doc Martin, Upstairs Downstairs & Prime Suspect)

I would compare it to a less hardcore version of The Wire. Where Northern Ireland Criminals/Mafia meets English Police force and they clash in a very dramatic dance for power and manipulation. There is the classic good cops bad cops, questions of loyalty and of course the cop overcoming a traumatic event. However in the Line of Duty series these scenarios  are very well written with plenty of plot twists and excitement which will keep you entertained and not thinking ""oh wait I've seen this before"".

I am a big fan of British drama's and this one certainly did not disappoint if I had to say one negative thing about this series it would be a common error found in many crime shows these days and that in a couple of episodes the solution to a problem comes way too quickly and too easily without any real investigation.  Other than that 10 out of 10 sit down with your friends and enjoy a real crime drama!",1392768000,2,1098,4.558375634517766

Superb writing and acting with some very unexpected surprises. Not your typical cop drama, at all. Hope there is a second series and what will happen with it considering how the last one ended. Where can they go and what can they do?",1392768000,,388,4.47887323943662
5776481,4,B00D7AM2YW,"Don't expect to see a 'whodunit' series.  This series is all about the drama and suspense.  I found a bit more in common with series like '24' and 'The Fall' (the British series), or even the US series 'The Unit' than any true crime mystery type series.  This show is all about ferreting out corruption in a British anti-terror unit.

It also has a lot in common with the new Jack Taylor and Jack Irish series.  They are all produced by Acorn Media, so I have a feeling they are trying to exploit a certain market here.  This series is televised on BBC2, so it is often a bit more raw than BBC1 shows.  Expect some language, violence, and a little blood and gore.  It's never too over the top, but it might be a bit much for some viewers.

Overall a good enough series, but the acting, while good, is not quite even or up to the standards of some other Acorn Media programs like Foyle's War.",1392681600,,891,4.255952380952381

8590243,5,B00D7AM2YW,"I watched all 3 seasons, and then #4 when it was released.  each series is a separate investigation, there are relationships and recurring characters that thread through each season. The Good: this is a series about anti-corruption, and not just a single street crime investigation so it's different. The writing is amazing. The stories are both complex and intertwined. These are the good cops looking for the ""bent"" coppers.

Each story has a main character, and a new investigation. Second the way each independent investigation hints back to a previous season grips the interest; something always brings in the backstories.  Don't pass this series by -- and do watch them consecutively. Last, this series has already been commission for two more seasons. And a ""shout out"" to Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar (I think he won an award for his work on this series) who work so well together.  This is one of my favorites out of the UK detective/crime dramas that they are so good at doing.",1524268800,,1007,4.905882352941177

8590247,5,B00D7AM2YW,"This BBC police procedural is something different, a plot drawn in shades of gray and a cast facing legal and moral dilemmas without easy answers.  ""Line of Duty Series 1"" highlights the anti-corruption branch of an unnamed British police force, investigators with a necessary but unwelcome job.  The newcomer is Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, a transfer from Anti-Terrorism following a botched raid.  His boss, Superintendent Hastings, sets his investigative sights on Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates, a policeman of the year with a record that might be too good to be true.  And Hastings has someone on the inside of Gates' team as an informant...

The series is well-cast, with strong performances throughout.  It takes an unflinchingly look at the challenge of corruption in the course of police work.  Best of all, it refuses its characters any easy exits from their challenges.  The tense plot should easily hold viewers' interest through its five hour-long episodes.  Very highly recommended.",1520121600,,1006,5.3164556962025316
