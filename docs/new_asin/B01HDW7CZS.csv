8765187,2,B01HDW7CZS,"The 2-star rating of this review is NOT for the content. The content's 5-stars all the way - good old-fashioned TV shows. However, as usual, Alpha Video has managed to muck things up, as they now use DVD-R discs for their material, and two of the four discs in this set would not play properly. Even the discs themselves are nearly all faded - as if their disc printing device was running out of ink.

Luckily I was able to find most of the damaged content on YouTube, and a lot of the programming on these are duplicates from some of the TV box sets that are out there, but that's kind of besides the point. There's no quality control at Alpha Video in-house productions. I was going to try and get a refund or a replacement, but it's really pointless to take the effort to send these defective ones back.",1468627200,,806,4.337748344370861
