The script is choppy at times so is the direction.  The music was decent but dear God the choreography was laughable.  The main lead Bobby Deol was probably the shining star on this ship, he pulled the movie up with a decent performance and he is as convincing as one can be portraying a wounded soul. Won't be dissapointed if you decide to reach for this one.",1457049600,,498,4.231578947368421
7938644,4,B00005J9PG,"This is perhaps a 2.5/3(ish) star film, but I gave it four stars because I had so much fun watching it. It's very obvious that this film is an adaptation of ""Leon: The Professional"", and depending on your feelings toward that film, Bollywood films, and over-the-top action films, you will either love or hate this film.

As a Bollywood action film, it's pretty typical. You have Bobby Deol as an assassin named Jeeva, who is strong and a total badass, but he softens as he becomes close to Rani Mukerji's character, Kiran. There are over-the-top action scenes with a lot of gun play. And the music is kind of weirdly placed compared to the romantic Bollywood films.

HOWEVER, since it's a Bollywood take on ""Leon"", it kind of is a lot of ridiculous fun to watch. Bobby Deol's Jeeva is given a back story, whereas Jean Reno's Leon did not have one. In Jeeva's back story, we learn that he had a girlfriend named Kiran, played by Malaika Arora, with a rich, corrupt father who disapproved of Jeeva's and Kiran's relationship. He frames Jeeva's mother and sister as prostitutes and both women are arrested, beaten, and publicly shamed. Jeeva gets beaten by the cops and when he and his family head home, Jeeva is busy fighting off hired thugs that he is too late to save his mother and sister who are locked inside their home...which has been set on fire. Kiran is unable to live with what her father has done, and kills herself. Jeeva kills Kiran's father as revenge for his mother, sister, and girlfriend. My brother watched this with me, and he and I were wondering what kind of a nutjob Kiran was to kill herself when she could have instead run away with Jeeva. But...OK.

Cut to present day, and Jeeva is a very successful assassin who is neighbors with a crazy family. Rani Mukerji's college aged character is the abused daughter of a schmuck who works for a corrupt police officer. Rani's father is always yelling at Rani, and her stepmother and stepsister find opportunities to hate on her. She gets hit by her father, too. The only light in her life is her older brother, who is coming to visit the family. During the visit, Rani's brother promises to take her away so she can finish college and find a husband. But oh snap! Rani's schmuck father has been stealing from his corrupt police officer boss so their whole family is murdered, except for Rani since she had gone out to the store. For the most part, it was hilarious to watch Rani's family ham up the acting as a dysfunctional family, and my brother and I were crying with laughter at how over-the-top emotionally stunted Rani's character was. However, I really did like that this film changed the brother from a younger brother to an older brother. I thought the brother/sister aspect was played well, and I did like the bond they had with each other. It was genuinely sad to see Rani cry over her brother's death.

So back to the story, Bobby Deol's Jeeva takes in Rani's character and Jeeva finds out Rani's character shares the name ""Kiran"" with his dead girlfriend. So yeah, in this film a romance blossoms between Jeeva and Kiran, which makes sense for Bollywood, and why this film decided to age up the main female character. There's a few funny song and dance numbers and Kiran cries dramatically like a little girl, and it's so silly, it was really fun to watch.

I guess I shouldn't give the whole plot away, but I can say, the film is action packed. There's this action scene that takes part at an amusement park and it was quite entertaining. I didn't really like the music, and the dancing wasn't that interesting either, and I'm a pretty big Bollywood fan, so take what you will from that. If you, for some reason, are deciding on whether or not you want to watch this film for the song and dance numbers, I would say you probably won't be into the film. If you're a die hard ""Leon"" fan and you can't stomach a ""Bollywood version"", you should stay away as well. However, if you're really into campy fun, this is a fun watch, at least once. It's also added fun if you're a fan of ""Leon"" to see the similarities between the films. There are some scenes that are shot just like or very closely to the original. My brother is a huge fan of ""Leon"" and I like that film quite a bit, but we both aren't such big fans that this adaptation upset us. It was entertaining, actually.",1418256000,,4350,4.508238276299113
7938645,3,B00005J9PG,it was a pretty good movie. but it was a poor take off of the professional with jean reno  I  like rani  but the part was called for a young girl. but on the whole of it was a pretty good movie,1386806400,,193,3.5476190476190474
7938646,4,B00005J9PG,"In my view this is one of Bobby Deol's best. This is different from regular Indian movies, which are usually long, dull, and predictable. Bichhoo is different, and even though it is a copy of Leon the Professional, it is great for an Indian movie. The story doesn't go soft and dry, the songs are not much of a disturbance to the pace, and Bobby Deol is believable as a tough-as-nails, battle-hardened, cold-blooded hero for hire! I didn't like his anti-cursing and anti-smoking attitude though, that was not realistic, not to mention his drinking milk like a good little boy, while he kills people for a living, was a bit out of place, oh well, this is an Indian movie afterall. The opening song with Hansraj Hans was a nice touch.",1304380800,,732,4.595419847328245
