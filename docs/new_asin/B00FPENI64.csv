6016609,1,B00FPENI64,"It seemed like a low budget film. The music was also old and the acting could have been better.  The makeup on the ""devil"" child was very bad. It seemed like the makeup was just slapped on his face.",1396483200,2,198,4.076923076923077
6016610,1,B00FPENI64,Oh no. Absolutely no. Had high hopes after reading reviews and purchased it for rental. I then realized that I'd better refresh my memory on Dante Tomaselli. Horror and Desecration average a 3 on imdb. I remember Satans Playground was horrible. I knew I blew it and did so in spades. Torture Chamber is terrible. Totally terrible.,1396310400,2,330,4.807017543859649
6016611,1,B00FPENI64,This movie was bad all the way around. Horrible acting throughout the entire movie. I understand this movie was low-budget. The director could have done a better job!!,1396051200,2,167,5.0
6016612,4,B00FPENI64,A rather surreal horror movie. More of a psycho drama film than one that will really scare you although it does have its moments. I found it entertaining,1393977600,4,153,4.5
6016613,5,B00FPENI64,This movie was well done. This is the next big one up there with the Exorcist. Hope Tomiselli makes more gruesome movies like this in the future. A must see!!,1393200000,4,158,4.3
6016614,5,B00FPENI64,"Dante Tomaselli is one of the most overlooked, and underrated horror directors that I know of. He has consistently put out great movies (Desecration, Horror and Satan's Playground) with barely a whisper from the mainstream. Is this a good thing? Yes and no. On one hand it keeps his maniacal genius to those chosen few lucky enough to find and appreciate his movies. I however, would like to see him strike it big. He deserves it. Not because multi-millions would change his ideas one iota, but because his vision would appeal to the masses. They just don't know it yet.

His latest film, Torture Chamber, is just the latest in a line of fever dream films designed to scare us, disturb us, and make us think about the society that we live in. Jimmy (Carmen LoPorto) is a young burn victim who seems to have special powers. He also seems to have a mind and soul that come straight from the bowels of hell. So when he decides to get revenge on everyone who he feels has done him wrong, recruiting and brainwashing a group of other young burn victims to help him in his plan, it seems as if nothing will be able to stand in his way. Jimmy's older brother, a priest, has tried to exorcise him several times without success. And his mother (Tomaselli regular Christie Sanford), is overtly religious as well, trying to find help for her youngest son, even though she was blinded by him. As the bodies pile up, will anyone be able to stop Jimmy's reign of demonic terror?

This is a movie that will leave you thinking. It will also immerse you in its intensity, and its atmosphere. It could almost qualify as a ""drug movie"". You know, Pink Floyd's The Wall, The Wizard Of Oz? That type of drug movie. It transports you. It takes you places. Almost all of his movies do this. There is not as much abstract horror imagery in this film as there is in ""Horror"" or ""Desecration"". But what it lacks in imagery, it makes up for in the music (oh, boy does it ever!). The music for the film was also done by Tomaselli, as is it should be. The director of a film should have the best ideas of how he or she wants the music to sound. The soundtrack here is intensely haunting. Voices and screams swirl and moan, and even take over for some of the dialog at points, transporting you into Jimmy's world. A world where hell lives on earth, and God is dead.

Also of note for Tomaselli fans is a cameo by Danny Lopes, who has had either major or minor roles in all of Dante's films. Knowing that there are several cast members who have appeared in previous films by the director makes the film seem more welcoming in some way. It somehow feels like we know the actors personally, and wonder what kinds of hell that Tomaselli is going to be putting them through this time. Lynn Lowry (from George Romero's The Crazies) also has a small role as one of Jimmy's school teachers. It's nice to see her getting some good roles recently, as it seemed as if she were away too long.

Torture Chamber has not been released yet. But it will be soon. Until then, you have Dante's other three films to digest, and I suggest that you do so at your earliest convenience. He is deserving of much, much more attention than he gets from movie goers. Give him and his new film a chance. I swear that you won't regret it. 9/10.",1387497600,5,3284,4.378688524590164

6016616,1,B00FPENI64,"The story was the worst story I have ever seen, I have seen  low budget films that were way better than this one. I never heard of Dante Tomaselli, now I know why. The kid looked like he ate a slice of pizza  and got it all over his face. He was torturing people himself if he had so much power, He could have just killed them without touching them. I really was bored out of my mind and  totally diasppointed , this director made good actors look bad, so upsetting , not sure if I will watch another one of his movies again. this one left a bad taste in my mouth.",1403827200,,564,3.9734513274336285
6016617,5,B00FPENI64,No film explores the potentials of horror like this one. Truly fearsome plot and imagery. It's like an encyclopedia of all the scary stuff that works best on film.,1403395200,,163,4.655172413793103
6016618,5,B00FPENI64,"This movie really creeped me out in spite of the low budget and cheap special effects. Plenty of blood and torture, but what really makes it good is the freaky creepiness. Would love to see it remade on a big budget by a major studio that did it justice.",1400371200,,254,4.204081632653061
6016619,2,B00FPENI64,"There's a kid.  He has abusive parents and an older brother who's a priest.  Did he become evil, is he possessed by a demon, or was he born that way? (Michael Myers?)  It's never really made clear in this movie.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks.  The kid's face looks like Heath Ledger's Joker after his ""accident"".  That's it!  Maybe this is a retelling of how the Joker came into being.  Not really. There's a psychiatrist trying to find this evil kid (Donald Pleasance or Michael McDowell?)  The kid ""recruits"" other kids into his cult.  The kid finds people who have wronged him in his childhood and his posse drags them to a cave to be tortured by medieval implements. He even attempts to cook his priest brother and mother on a wicked slab fireplace device.  Does any one survive?  Does the exorcism help?  Well, if you like torture or like being tortured, rent this piece of crap and waste 90 minutes.  Bad acting, direction, lighting, script writing... it's all bad.  Another Amazon treasure.",1399334400,2,1008,4.6477272727272725
6016620,5,B00FPENI64,"Once again Dante Tomaselli delivers with his fantastic story and atmosphere. Horror use to be my favorite but this is tied now with it. I love his locations,characters and like I said before the atmosphere in his films are just amazing.",1396828800,3,236,4.780487804878049
6016621,5,B00FPENI64,"It never ceases to amaze me how quick people are to criticize what they don't understand....""Where's the bang or the quick movements? where's the explanation of what i'm watching?""  sigh...Dante's films are brilliant and refreshing. They are the perfect definition of bringing a nightmare to the screen.  I especially love to re watch his films, as I always notice something different that I didn't catch before. His use of symbolism is right up my alley.  He never lets the viewer off the hook, as you often have to read between the lines and pay attention to the background details which only enhances the viewers pleasure.  Torture Chamber is no exception to the qualities that Dante possesses in his films. The more I watch this film, the better it gets.  Lots of chilling scenes and personally.... I liked the make-up effects, ambiance, sound effects etc.  The characters in this film are also interesting, as the child embodies true evil, but at  the same time you feel sorry for him.  His mother in the film ,played by Christie Sanford, does a good job playing a mother who is often cruel and wrapped up in her own obsession.  I fear if I continue  then i'll give spoilers. I think people should watch this film for themselves and come to their own conclusions and find out what it means to them.  I truly enjoyed this film and I can't wait for his next film as usual.",1396828800,2,1375,4.640495867768595
6016622,5,B00FPENI64,"Dante Tomaselli's horror films are unlike anything out there.  Ever since I ran across the trailer for his film ""Horror"" on the internet back in 2006, I immediately ordered it along with his other two films ""Desecration"" and ""Satan's Playground."" From that day on I was hooked and have spread the word of his films ever since. He's without a doubt my favorite modern day horror filmmaker. His films feel like Nightmares caught on film for me, and that's the highest compliment I can give a horror movie.  That is what horror should be in the first place right? Torture Chamber is his best to date in my opinion.  It combines the surreal tones from his previous films, but with a more straight forward narrative.  That's not to say this movie isn't a movie that won't make you think.  Unlike most brain dead horror films today, you have to figure some things out for yourself with this one.  Kind of like putting together a horror puzzle, which makes repeat viewings a must!

In essense, this horror film is about a boy possessed by a demon, but underneath the surface there is child abuse, mental illness and other surprises i won't dare spoil.  The cinematography is excellent and the score is reminsent of the Classic horror film Halloween in some scenes.  The makeup effects are very disturbing and the locations that take place in the dark and dreary torture chambers are creepy as hell.

Tomaselli has made a horror movie for REAL horror fans and has a cult following that's undeniable.  I'm hoping he releases another movie for us horror fiends asap!!  I don't write reviews for movies often  on here, but when I do it means it's had a huge impact on me.  Go support real Independent horror with heart and substance!  I'm outta here.",1396828800,2,1739,4.655737704918033
6016623,5,B00FPENI64,"Visually stunning, great locations/tone, with a cast that includes classic horror stars like Lynn Lowry. Christie Stanford, a Tomaselli favorite, is a standout. If you like this cult horror auteur's work, you'll enjoy this psychological thriller.",1396828800,2,246,5.861111111111111

8617605,1,B00FPENI64,"If this movie could be rated by numbers, I'd give it a -100.  There sure are some dopey people here who don't know theiir ass from their elbow when it comes to film making.  The first element of a good film is a good script.  There is an incomplete and s***ty story here.  He doesn't know how to write, and his ego won't permit someone else to write a good script for him.  The look of the film is good.  The acting is fine *(as well as actors can do without much to hang on to), but the story really sucks. Or should I Say lack thereof.",1441756800,,537,3.97196261682243

8617607,1,B00FPENI64,The acting is worse than a high school play. The entire script is very predictable & lacks charector development. If you like cheesy low budget horror movies that people get burned than you will like this.,1430092800,,205,4.722222222222222
8617608,4,B00FPENI64,"Nice follow-up to his last film ""Satan's Playground"". While this one had many influences from 70s and 80s ""killer kids"" type of movies it really stood on it's own and was very suspenseful",1427760000,,187,4.696969696969697
8617609,4,B00FPENI64,"I found this to be a very refreshing horror outing. It has a slightly incoherent and loose narrative structure like a Lucio Fulci film, but manages to build menace and tension throughout.  It does this only utilizing a few tools, such as evil masks and dark corridors. The plot is pretty minimal, but uses an underlying theme of catholic guilt to springboard into the possession of an evil, pyrokinetic child that takes revenge on his community at a nearby castle replete with torture devices. It's shot pretty nicely. The movie uses every possible shade of blackness and shadow to create an oppressive atmosphere. It IS atmospheric and quite moody. There is some gore, but the emphasis is mainly on this simmering dread that is reflected in the theme of fire and devil possession - as characters get burnt, feet smolder on hot floors, houses are set on fire and smoke rises from the corners. There is a disparity in acting styles. To be kind, I would say the actor who is the psychiatrist is miscast. His presence in the film somewhat takes you out of the picture when he appears. He really sticks out like a sore thumb. I wish the familial drama of the story had been fleshed out a little more. But overall, watching this made me want to check out Tomaselli's earlier features and I am interested in seeing his next one. The poster art is a TRUE DISSERVICE to the vision that was put in the film. I don't know who approved the V.O.D. art, but it is a mistake - it makes it look EXACTLY like a cheap horror movie relegated to video on demand purgatory, while what is behind the play button is much richer and rewarding.",1421366400,,1620,4.5290102389078495
8617610,4,B00FPENI64,"It wasn't fantastic, but seldom is any film these days. Thise being said, it was wonderfully gorey, full of intense action and held my attention beginning to end. Worth a watch if you like the HorrorGore genre.",1421193600,,210,4.702702702702703
8617611,4,B00FPENI64,I thought this movie was pretty good despite being a lower budget film. I would recommend watching it .,1420848000,,103,4.473684210526316
8617612,1,B00FPENI64,"Little Jimmy Morgan (Carmen LoPorto) has been disfigured by fire and appears to be demon possessed. He escapes from his cage using his powers of....fire, heat, ad whatever.  There is a nearby castle, dungeons, tunnels, traps and a bunch of kids in orange jump suits who follow Jimmy and help him torture people.

The film doesn't care about chronology and haphazardly interjects flashbacks. The effects and music had the feel of an old Italian horror film and it made even less sense.

I wasn't sure what was going on, or what the picture on the DVD cover has to do with the film.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Has a lot of bad ideas for kids to get a buzz from household products.",1418515200,2,685,4.5
8617613,4,B00FPENI64,"Does this film make sense? No, not much. Is the acting great? Nope. Some of it is good and some of it is painfully bad. This is still a great horror movie despite the plot and the acting. Tomaselli always sets a great creepy, atmospheric mood in his films and does most of the sound and music by himself, and the score/sound scape is just as important to his films as the visual aspect is. Some people are quick to bash Dante's films, which is quite obvious from reviews on here and other sites like imdb, but Dante deserves more credit than he gets for what he does right rather than what he does wrong. He makes great atmospheric horror movies on very low budgets and makes the movies look like they have much higher budget. This movie cost around $200,000 but it looks like a million bucks went into it. Of course the film looking good is also due to the other creative people he works with who strive to do a good job. My worst complaint about this movie is the cover art. It's terrible GARBAGE! Some generic crap that the distributor slapped on it and I doubt Mr. Tomaselli even liked it. Some of the original concept art done for the film by the late Sean Hartter would have been much much better. As is the cover art is horrid and makes no sense with a tagline ""Fear the dark"" which also has nothing to do with the movie really. So in closing I need to say this movie will be more appreciated by fans of obscure, weird, atmospheric old European horror rather than mainstream American horror films. It's all about mood and atmosphere here, not constant gore and naked women running around for no reason, not that that's a bad thing mind you but that is what most people expect when they see a horror movie these days and when a movie like Torture Chamber comes along it leaves them baffled and they see it as pointless and stupid. Yeah, so not a bad movie and not a bad director by any means. You think it stinks? I'd like to see you do better.",1412899200,4,1950,4.301630434782608
