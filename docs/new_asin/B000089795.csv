1830219,3,B000089795,"Julia Sweeney's one-woman show about the time in her life when both she and her brother were dealing with cancer has been filmed and is now on DVD.  GOD SAID, HA! does not hide the fact that Julia Sweeney is performing a one-woman show.  She stands on a stage and delivers the monologue as the audience watches and laughs.
Julia Sweeney is best known as the asexual character ""Pat"" from Saturday Night Live.  In monologue-mode here, Sweeney is much softer and sweeter than I imagined her to be after watching SNL.  She's basically a nice Catholic girl and the stories she tells about her family are engaging and charming.  Her manner of delivery is very matter-of-fact and a bit ""stagey"".  But don't be turned off by that.  The story she's telling has a payoff, and her message is honest and true.
GOD SAID, HA! will not rock your world.  But it is a slice of Julia Sweeney's life - both comedic and sad.",1058918400,15,904,4.5030674846625764

1830234,5,B000089795,"I've enjoyed this piece by Julia Sweeney for years, first on VHS, and now watching it on Amazon Instant Video.  Her story is humorous and human, and her delivery is wonderful.  Amazon needs to improve its service, however, as the audio and video were often slightly out of synch, the movement of her lips not exactly corresponding with the audio (not a problem with my old VHS).

(Amazon later issued a refund.)",1360886400,,411,4.680555555555555
1830235,3,B000089795,Not nearly as good as most stand-ups.  I I guess I have been spoiled by Saturday night live. Expect more form her.,1357257600,,114,4.181818181818182
1830236,5,B000089795,"In the vein of Spalding Gray and his one man shows (Swimming to Cambodia, Gray's Anatomy), this film shows Julia Sweeney at her most personal, honest, and creative as she talks though the death of her brother from cancer and her own experience with the disease. The film catches every range of emotion, but has an honest humor to it that finds an interesting balance in happiness and sadness.",1239753600,3,392,4.695652173913044
1830237,4,B000089795,"I really laughed out loud at certain parts of Julia's monologue. What I love is that she can be a well known ""star"" and yet still weather the emotional day to day-ness of  living with her brother's diagnosis.......knowing full well that humor can get us all through life's worst curveballs! I thought this dvd was great...a real  treat .... very human!",1195257600,3,352,4.754098360655738
1830238,3,B000089795,"it's got heart, but it gets a little too personal to remain of universal interest, unless you know julia sweeney or knew her brother.  she is witty and has great delivery & timing, but i expected a bit more humor and a little less sappiness.  i had heard an interview in which she discussed her take on religion and how she fell ""out of touch"" with (her) god, and the comments she made in the interview where awesome, thought provoking.  i misunderstood that this dvd was similar to the ""routine"" she performed on the radio interview.  the dvd would be a great way to ease into the mourning period if someone close to you was dying of cancer, but still active in many ways.",1173398400,,673,4.403225806451613
1830239,5,B000089795,"Thoroughly enjoyable and insightful observation on the human condition.  Poignantly demonstrates how fine the line is between comedy and tragedy, and how inseparable the two can be.  Helps explain Ms. Sweeney's mood in her later  fantastic work, ""Letting Go of God>'",1169337600,8,266,5.439024390243903
1830240,5,B000089795,"When I tell people to rent or buy God Said Ha, naturally they think I am being irreverent! Such is not the case.

This one woman show based on the true story of Julia and her family is poignant, hilarious and heartbreaking.

After Julia's divorce and relocation to California, privacy seems to be a hard thing to fine. Her brother had passed out in a public building and was rushed to the hospital. Not having medical insurance because of poor health, her brother had been going to the clinic where his disease was not diagnosed.

Pretty soon Julia's parents are living in her small house and chaos prevails. Not only is Julia taking care of her brother but dealing with the inevitable problems of too many people in too little a space.

Julia's brother is in the end stages of cancer. Before long Julia also develops cancers and requires a hysterctomy. Will the chaos ever end!

But Julia's great since of humor about her situation shines through the entire one woman show.

After seeing the show I also read the book. I would recommend this as a follow up of this great one woman show.

I must also add that without saying so, this is the best recommendation for legislation for health insurance for everyone!",1161475200,17,1211,4.604651162790698

She shares her experience of her parents' and brother's moving into her small Hollywood bungalow when the latter becomes terminally ill with lymphoma. A short time after her life gets thrown upside down by this drastic adjustment to her lifestyle, she discovers she too has cancer.

While the production values are minimal, Julia Sweeney is a gem. Few people can blend comedy and poignancy so skilfully as she. You can get a preview in one of Julia's TED talks and decide if you want to watch this comedy, both touching and hilarious.",1432857600,,627,4.859813084112149
