8052567,3,B0007WFUFQ,"This is one of those A&E TV documentaries. Not really all that bad. Leonard Nemoy hosts and you explore what was once King Arthurs realm. They still cant say with certainty that there was no Arthur or the knights of the round, let alone a Camelot.

They cover a lot of the history of Arthur, ok not history unless you know it is fact, so they cover a lot of the legend of King Arthur. All the different tales about him, Lancelot, Camelot, Galahad, Merlin a little. His supposed burial site, they give credit to Arthur for stone hedge being in England.

A&E Mysteries have always been fascinating, but they never really seem to solve any great mysteries. Still I think this movie was interested. Glad I got a chance to watch it.",1401667200,2,727,4.458646616541353
8052568,4,B0007WFUFQ,"A & E's DVD on ""Camelot"" is one of the better documentaries on the subject of King Arthur's folklore and gives details in several different mindsets on related issues.  Leonard Nimoy narrates this video and there are several landscape nature photography shots and sweeping footage on location that helps this movie be the one that adults should prefer over most of the other videos by other narrators or other producing studios.  Whereas most documentaries are juvenile and a tad on the amateur side in presentation, this version has enough interesting information that not only will you keep it in your library, you'll gladly watch it more than once.  One point of interest was the birthplace of Arthur and how the archaeology discoveries are connecting that location with the right time period, another is the information on the Holy Grail and how it is tied to Joseph of Arimathea, and of course the details surrounding the location and legends of Camelot.  There is time given to different ancient authors and what emphasis was given by those authors to specific parts of the Arthurian folklore - including how the burial place of King Arthur and Guinevere helped a city and monastery by tourism. Interviews with scholars round out the scope of this film, making this one superior to the others typically geared to preteen audiences.",1304208000,12,1337,4.982062780269058
8052569,2,B0007WFUFQ,"The advertisements for this DVD suggest that it will give you the true and historical story of Camelot.  Alas, it falls far short of that--far, far short.  In the end Camelot is a mere fairy tale, not hard history.  The disk covers the myths, and they are nothing more.  The disk provides some vague commentaries by professors and the like.  Leonard Nimoy poses dozens of rhetorical questions in a tone that implies he is actually telling the viewer something of import.  But rhetorical questions are used because there just isn't anything else.

There are no reliable documents from the period in which King Arthur lived.  Every thing written about him and Camelot came centuries later.  There is no documented site of where Camelot stood.  Surely no one believes that the Lady of the Lake actually reached up with Excalibur.  No one believes in Merlin or Morgan la Fey or that young Arthur pulled the stone out of a rock.  No serious person believes in the Easter Bunny either.

The story of Camelot is a pretty story, after all.  It is not history.  Cinderella wasn't fitted for a glass slipper either, but we suspend our disbelief willingly and enjoy the fiction.  Shine too bright a light on it, and the piece dies.",1261612800,,1220,4.710900473933649
