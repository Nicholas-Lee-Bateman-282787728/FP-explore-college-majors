8302270,5,B001FPKJNW,"I'm a professional athlete...but I wanted something quick and easy to take on the road when I had to deal with the ""business"" end of things or do on a day when I wasn't on my usual program.  I was AMAZED!!!  Seems so simple, but you definitely know you have worked when you're done!  If you want to get in shape, this is SO USER FRIENDLY and a great workout to start the ball rolling.  Unlike so many DVD workouts that will make anyone feel totally incompetent, you'll feel like you can do this right away (building confidence), but also that you are definitely getting a great workout.  DOLVETT: GET GOING ON MORE VIDEOS!!!! YOU HIT THE MARK!!!",1334707200,7,645,4.432203389830509
8302271,5,B001FPKJNW,"In a nutshell: 30 Minutes, beginner and advanced levels. No necessary equipment or weights. It is efficient and EFFECTIVE.

This video gets it done.  I'm feeling tighter and finding lean muscles I didn't realize I had.  My butt has firmed and lifted, my thighs have trimmed!!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

Thank you, Dolvett Quince!",1318377600,10,323,5.037735849056604
8302272,5,B001FPKJNW,"There are two 30 minute routines on this DVD - one for ""beginners"" and one for ""advanced"".  The dvd quality is excellent.  The location is a well stocked and attractive indoor gym.  The only piece of equipment used during the exercises is a metal folding chair.  The music is unobtrusive and doesn't compete with Dolvett's instructions.  Dolvett is encouraging and his pacing and cueing are excellent. During the video, there are a female and a male doing the exercises with him. However, if the thought of stepping up onto a chair with your full weight or doing push-ups or one-leg squats scares you, this is NOT the video for you.  In my opinion, this is a unique strength and toning program for people who are already in good shape and want to maintain their condition.",1274400000,21,772,4.681481481481481
