My sister visited Rothenburg and loved this tour, so she bought me the DVD and I thought it was great.  The gentleman in the video is the same man and he is entertaining.  I learned a lot about Rothenburg and hope to visit one day.",1344211200,,331,4.046153846153846
8338644,3,B001RQLAFA,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  I have visited Rothenburg, Germany and loved this tour.  The guide (who has been doing this tour for years) is a funny, entertaining person, but that did not come across.  Also, they didn't give the history of the famous clock in this wonderful town.  Too much history with drawings and not enough of the Night Watchman himself giving the history!",1325894400,,382,4.742424242424242
8338645,5,B001RQLAFA,"If you saw this famous tour while in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, you will enjoys this video.  It takes you through the night watchman's tour of the city plus much more!  You will learn more about crime and punishment, daily life, art, religion, trade and other aspects of daily medieval life.  The dvd also shows many more sights that you may have missed while there.  If you are planning on travelling there (I highly recommend it) this video will give you a great introduction to what you are about to see.",1254441600,4,506,4.527472527472527
