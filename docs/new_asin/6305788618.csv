7894333,4,6305788618,"Yes...I needed to see this flick because I am of Puerto Rican heritage and came from a military family where all our men went to war.
Ours are the BEST INFANTRY MEN and that should be a shining star of pride for our enchanted isle.  However, the only thing I felt was sadness because it depicts the true reality of war and what it does to all soldiers as well as their families.  The acting was superb.  For such a small island we have given the international community an incredible array of artists from all of the disciplines of art, music, and theatre.  BRAVO on a wonderful movie that should be viewed globally.",1441152000,,616,4.424778761061947

7894335,5,6305788618,"Being both an ex-soldier of that area, and Puerto Rican, I can tell you they nailed it, with this movie.
At the time some of the actors were new to TV, still they did a super job telling the story, and with details that only someone who was there would know.
Love it and thank you Amozon......8)

P.S. If you like this movie should also try to get a copy of  (Westside Story)",1391472000,,375,4.123287671232877
7894336,5,6305788618,I first watched this movie when it came out to the theaters many years ago in Puerto Rico. The movie still moves me today. It tells the story unsung heroes who gave their lives to defend and protect a country that wasn't theirs. It's definitely a movie worth watching...,1210032000,,270,4.530612244897959
7894337,4,6305788618,"The story line was fine and so was the acting. Many of the actors are not well known in mega hit movies, however, it brings to the public the hardships many Puerto Ricans in the military face even today. Puerto Ricans have served with honors in many of the wars and conflict since World War One. Their accomplishments, bravery, and suffering in battle have been over looked by the media and historians. However, their stories will one day be told.",1200614400,,447,4.6
7894338,5,6305788618,"This movie is not only for all the Puerto Ricans that fought in Vietnam War. It is for ALL people regardless of their ethicity that have been FORCED to fight in a war they didn't want to fight. Being a Puerto Rican movie it is easier to talk about the issue that touches us. You have two main characters: one that has been forced to go in a war he doesn't want to participate in and another one who is obsessed in participating in the war. They influence each other in a positive way. Because of the circunstances there is an internal fight in one of the latter's mind.

It is the story of men who fight for another country, because, I don't know about you, but to me Puerto Rico is MY country. Regardless of our political status and the way the world economy works.

It is a very touching story and it's relatable to anyone who have had experiences in being forced into the military to fight a war you didn't want to go in and how it affects your family, no matter if you're from the US, Canada, PR, Vietnam or the rock you live under.",1129075200,5,1036,4.201005025125628
7894339,4,6305788618,"this movie is in spanish. not dubbed. it received an honorary mention at vina del mar international film festival in chile. puertorrican actors, producers and director. first feature length for this young director. ""a viewers's"" review shows a huge lack of education regarding puerto rico's and united state's history. not even the president of the united states understood vietnam's war. well, neither did puertorricans. 48,000 ""boricuas"" took part in the conflict. so it has nothing to do with the pro-independence from the united states movement in the island. a literal translation for the title would be another homeland's heroes. to any puertorrican homeland is puerto rico, not the united states. it is only when you bring the military issue when division arises.",1116028800,5,770,5.319672131147541
