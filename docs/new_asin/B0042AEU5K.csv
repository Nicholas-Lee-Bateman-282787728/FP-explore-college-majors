4247071,3,B0042AEU5K,"A languid and slow paced film most likely to appeal to those with an interest in political/historical dramas.  This one covers a violent conflict between wealthy French settlers and the indigenous peoples of a poverty-ridden African nation in the throes of a revolution for self-rule.  Actually, neither side in this conflict is presented in a sympathetic way. But the movie itself will be of sufficient interest to viewers attuned to geopolitical changes and upheavals.",1303862400,4,470,5.337837837837838
4247072,5,B0042AEU5K,"Set in modern Africa - A local people who have had little control over their lives are tossed around from one hopeless existence to another.  A band of young men organize for power - but they have no vision - they can only hope to eventually serve a new dictator. The White Settlers cling to an old vision - their time has come to an end.  Isabelle Huppert - a member of a White Settler family - is amazing in this role - a butterfly with an iron will.  At times she gets respect, when it would appear there was none to be had.  A mesmerizing film and soundtrack - I would compare it to Werner Herzog's ""Aguirre Wrath of God.""",1303603200,2,626,4.148760330578512
4247073,2,B0042AEU5K,"This had the potential to be a good film. Stubborn Maria Vial and her family refuse to leave their African planatation even as it becomes the frontline in an African civil war. Isabelle Huppert gives an outstanding performance. Unfortunately for her, the script she is given is rather uneven. It has a tendency to veer away from an honest realism into nonsense.

The parts dealing with Maria's obsesion to save the plantation and its coffee crop against all sense recalls a great many other films about farmers and their struggle for their land. She plays tough convincingly in a way that most other actresses could not. And they really capture the collapse of order in a war zone quite well. The film is unusually honest toward its African characters. There is no sentimentality about it which is unusual in itself.

But where the film falls down is that the script wants to exact moral vengence on the ""family"" owning the plantation probably for political reasons. And so for no particular reason her son suddenly goes all Kurtz from Heart of Darkness. Her ex-husband (why exactly in story terms its necessary for him to be an ex-husband is beyond vague) plans to flee but inexplicably doesn't flee. And toward the very end, Maria commits an act that its completely inexplicable in terms of the story the characters. All the vengence on the family undercuts everything that was done well in the film.

Then there is the character of ""the boxer"". The legendary rebel leader who Maria, without any sense/reason or explation suddenly decides to shelter within her home. None of the other characters or the family members seem to even participate in the decision. No explaination is given for why this is happening. It only seems to serve as an excuse for the army to come and kill everyone.

The best points the film makes, it seems to make in spite of itself. The Vials don't come across as exploiters or even aliens in the country. They come across as people without means caught in a war zone. While some would inexplicably identify with idiotic rebel army and its child soldiers as bringing some kind of justice, that film doesn't seem to say that at all. The corrupt local mayor is far richer than the ""white material"" and will be more of a ruthless exploiter of the locals than the Vials were when he takes the plantation for himself. And the death of the Pharmacist in town is also important. She is as foolish and stubborn as Maria is for similar reasons. And her pointless death undercuts any notion that the problems in the story are racial or colonial.

Where the film is a miss is that it fails to show the reality that while colonialism in terms of farmers of modest means from Europe is over, colonialism in terms of massive international corporations operating in Africa is alive and well. While the Vials are ""obsolete"", the colonial enterprise is alive and well. Wealth is extracted from Africa by far more efficient means than those represented by the Vials. Modern explotation is done from secure compounds or on remote control from a western hotel in the capital.

The craft of the film is excellent in terms of capturing the look and feel of Africa. Isabelle Huppert's performance is beyond excellent. But the script should have been more like ""places of the heart"" or ""the river"". A dark ending would have been appropriate, but the confusing and almost nosensical way the film ended didn't do justice to all the good elements in it.",1302739200,15,3453,4.737104825291182
4247074,4,B0042AEU5K,"As civil war rages on about her in an unnamed African country, a white French woman refuses to abandon the coffee plantation that has been in her family for years.  Claire Denis directs, and the imagery is stunning.  Isabelle Huppert is perfect as Maria Vial, who runs the plantation with her ex-husband (Cristopher Lambert).  She needs to be fierce and intelligent and deeply in denial of the true nature of her situation, and she manages to channel just the right combination of toughness and vulnerability.

The story itself is told elliptically, and while it starts out realistic, with moments of obscure violence we don't understand until much later, in the end it begins to seem more like a fable.  Moments of the film, such as when Maria's son shaves his head and runs wild with the lost boys of the rebel army, feel like something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B003XMXZCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>, or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies/dp/B001BEK8EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies</a>.  The viewer's thrown into the midst of the situation, and the narrative moves back and forth between past and present without much in the way of warning.  The film's depictions border on surreal in several instances, where you lose track of what is reality or dream or symbol.  The ""white material"" of the title refers, seemingly, to the ""stuff"" that the whites who flee the country leave behind, that is there to be scavenged, whether by the local armies and leaders who had been supported by an international military presence, or by the hungry young armies that make up the rebellion.  More broadly, though, it suggests the influx of foreign capital and foreign military that had enabled this family to feel their position to be unassailable, as the natural order of things.

As I take it the film's power lies precisely in its ability to depict this sense of oblivion, this lack of awareness of time and place, this way in which the main white characters in the film have no clear sense of their participation and culpability in the ongoing conflict around them.  They act as if it were something merely happening to them, and as if things should really just go back to ""normal"" - as if it were normal for a small white family to live in luxury as the owners of a large tract of land, with wealth that comes from the labor of men and women who leave their families behind to serve them, and while the majority population around them is impoverished.  Maria is astonished when the local boys exact a toll from her as she drives to town - she knows them, and knows their families after all - but what she doesn't consider is that she knows their families largely as locals who have worked for her, a situation that seemed natural for her because the international military sustained the power structure that ensured their rights to property that had, effectively, been stolen from the locals long before.  Even her ex-husband, who at least has the presence of mind to realize that their current situation is untenable and that they need to evacuate, laughs when the local mayor says he could have them arrested.  After all, they are old friends, he thinks - not fully aware of how radically the situation has changed.  There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in this film or in the dark situation it depicts - the wealthy Europeans are not themselves directly responsible for the situation they've inherited, and the locals are not wrong to want what they see as theirs.

It's a beautiful film, and I think it's essential that it be done right to get at the subtlety of the look they've achieved here - so it's a good thing this is being released by Criterion.  I was lucky enough to catch this in a theater but for those who don't it's lucky that Criterion is releasing this one.  Apart from the stark beauty of the imagery, It's also a dark film, that avoids a straightforward and linear narrative in order to challenge and provoke.  I expect some will be put off by that, but I found it quite fascinating.",1300492800,,4172,4.968390804597701

4247076,5,B0042AEU5K,"White Material is vague,obtuse,brooding,inexplicable,lacking psychological detail or narrative structure or plotting dynamic. Entering into a dreamworld of image and sound impressions, we read from the characters and pick up from the landscape the clues we need from the montage of concrete impression and abstract manouever. From the opening running dogs caught in the headlights to the dead body of the rebel leader caught in the torchlight we enter the oneiric door of a disturbing realm. We are in a perpetual present,both timeless and modern,in an unnamed African Francophone country. Isabel Huppert(Maria) runs a coffee plantation for her family,ex-husband, father-in-law,son. Stubbornly, blindly wanting to harvest and process the coffee beans, in the face of civil war,despite the fact her farmworkers are fleeing for their own survival,that her son is bone-idle,her ex-husband(Lambert) wants to leave,her father-in-law just wanders around,not wishing to leave. Things are left unsaid,or we pick up from two native speakers or a rebel DJ that the party is over for white people:""no more drinking cocktails on the verandah"". Their farms and possessions are `white material',superficial to the needs of the African people, in the escalating civil war between government militia and wandering child soldiers and rebel gunmen.

Unfolding in flash-backs as Maria scrambles to make her way back home on the back of a bus. Huppert plays her part with steely magnificence and physical perseverence. Maria is determined to stay and with the help of local villagers, carries on alone to manage the harvest,in an attempt to bring the coffee to market. The dehumanising force of violence sweeps everybody up in its psychotic force,especially the troubled Manuel(Duvauchelle),Maria's son. At the centre of the maelstrom is the brooding figure of Boxer(De Bankole),who is wounded,on the run,bleeding away into legend. He's the rebel leader. Hiding out on Maria's farm. This is a journey into the heart of darkness,in a vision of African-set apocalypse. Raw, unfocused,with no coherence,but a fluid logic of consciousness as it experiences collapse and chaos. We experience a world with pitiless intensity: ""how being white in Africa gives you a special status, almost a kind of magical aura. It protects you from misery and starvation. But although it can protect you, it is dangerous too. This is what Maria has to learn. The danger for Maria is that she thinks she belongs in Africa because she is close to the land and the people. She cannot return to France because she thinks that it will weaken her. But she learns that she doesn't belong in Africa as much as she thinks. For many white people in Africa this is the reality(Denis).""The sound track by Tindersticks is mesmerizing. The film captures the white colonialists' guilt and bad faith,but also their passionate longing to stay as they are caught in the middle of an African civil war.

Perhaps not giving a time frame or more information about the politics of the place where this film takes place is meant to metaphorical, but for many viewers it will make the story more of a conundrum than is necessary.

Maria Vial (the extraordinary actress Isabelle Huppert) runs a coffee plantation owned by her father-in-law Henri (Michel Subor): the plantation has seen better economic days and Maria's former husband Andr (Christophe Lambert) who not only offers no help to the plantation but is trying to sell it before it goes bankrupt: Andrs also  has taken another woman Lucie (Adle Ado) and has a young son by her.  Maria's only child Manuel (Nicolas Duvauchelle) is a tattooed loser and probably his unstable mind is due to drug abuse.  So it is Maria by herself that is in charge of the plantation.

There is a political uprising with rebels, led by Boxer (Isaach De Bankol), destroying all the white material seen to be the evil of the country.  Maria sides with Boxer, protecting him from the ruling corrupt government, and as the people Maria has employed on her plantation flee because of the insurrection, Maria is repeatedly warned to return to France - an idea she finds repugnant and will do anything to save her land.  She gathers a few frightened people to harvest her coffee beans, but as she is processing the beans she uncovers a severed goat head in the beans - a sign of doom.

Even giving aid to Boxer, the chief of the rebels, fails to alter her plight.

8413315,4,B0042AEU5K,"I saw this film when it first came out, and have now viewed it for a second time.  There is an atmosphere of menace in this picture that is immediately recognizable, that becomes increasingly palpable as the film progresses.  As the picture gains momentum, the characters surrounding the defiantly determined Maria Vial (Isabelle Huppert), begin to play out their personal vendettas and the dominoes start to fall.  There are creepy scenes with child soldiers stealthily entering the dwellings of the plantation compound, taking jewelry, clothes and whatever else they find to be of value.  Everyone is under surveillance, hiding in plain sight, fearing for their lives; the African soldiers are killing not just the whites, but also their own people as anarchy descends.

Isabelle Huppert, as Maria, gives an understated performance; in an interview featured on the supplemental material of this DVD, she explains that Maria does not show any emotion.  Maria is described, on the back cover of the DVD, as being ""ferocious"" and a ""crazed character"".  But after watching Huppert's performance, neither of those descriptions seem appropriate.  Maria is tenacious yet impassive; it's as if the high stakes of Maria's situation demand stoicism.  It is not until near the end of the film, when her world has collapsed, that we see any evidence of her being crazed or ferocious.  Huppert's performance is one of quiet desperation, of internal crumbling, of someone refusing to recognize the harsh reality confronting her.  Huppert is a chameleon who blends into the ambiance of any picture she appears in; she achieves this in ""White Material"" as well.

Christophe Lambert also gives a strong and understated performance as Andr&eacute;, Maria's husband, who is afraid and urgently suggests to Maria that they escape the plantation; and yet he is also trapped.  The frightening breakdown of Manuel, Maria's spoiled brat son (portrayed by Nicolas Duvauchelle) is another crucial aspect of the film; hs is the primary underminer, who through his destructive actions, initiates and increases the momentum of the downward spiral of the plantation.  In the final twenty minutes of the film, Maria puts on a pink dress, which functions as a metaphor for her fragility.  The score by Tindersticks, composed specifically for this picture, provides a moody, alternative counterpoint that underlines the atmosphere of desolation.  Highlights of the supplemental material of this DVD include interviews with Claire Denis, who I found to be compelling in person; and with Isabelle Huppert (that I already mentioned), in which she discusses her character Maria.

I have not seen any other pictures by Claire Denis, and so I cannot compare this film to her other work.  After seeing ""White Material"", I would classify her as a documentarian of a brutal hyperreality, which manifests in ""White Material"" as the death and destruction that moves like a wildfire across the countryside to devour the Vial coffee plantation and the world of Maria Vial and her family.  Based on the strength of ""White Material"", I am interested in seeing Claire Denis' other films.

8413316,5,B0042AEU5K,"As of this very moment I have only seen two films by South African native Claire Denis (`White Material' and '50 Shots of Rum') and both films are cinematic marvels; true masterpieces.  Of the two, I think that I prefer `White Material', a film that is equal parts shocking and aggressive as well as soft and intimate.

`White Material' tells the story of Maria Vial, a woman running a coffee plantation in South Africa during civil unrest.  As violence closes in around Maria and her family, she balks at the cautions directed at her and continues to persist in her everyday affairs, despite beings met with opposition from all fronts.  The scenario definitely plays with her sanity, especially as the war surrounding her starts to take devastating effect on those she loves and tries to protect.  With her husband turning on her and her son delving into his own state of madness, Maria is forced to fight alone, but her fighting spirit can only take her so far.

All is lost.

Instead of dampening the film with details that take us out of the story in an attempt to expound upon it, Claire Denis takes a more simplistic approach, allowing the impact of the characters themselves to envelope the audience.  As some have already mentioned, there is no backdrop given here.  We are simply dropped into a situation and left to fend for ourselves to make heads or tails of it.  That could have been a very bad thing had the direction not been so sharply effective.  Instead of feeling confused and or befuddled, Denis paints a rather straightforward picture that needs to backstory to feel intimate and provocative.  The lack of detail leaves a lasting stain of chaos that effortlessly soaks into the fabric of the tale being told.

Atop the brilliance that is Denis (her directorial hand is so magnificently used to relay emotional relevance, especially in sequences of distilled tension such as that breathtaking scene between Maria's son and the two young boys), the actors here all make a splash, especially Isabelle Huppert and Christopher Lambert, who plays her son.  Huppert suppresses the madness brewing within Maria with such frenetic tension.  You can feel it itching beneath her skin.  Lambert is flawless in his transition from apathetic to completely barbaric, and it never once feels betrayed by inaccuracy.  He feels completely authentic from start to finish.

Some have found the lack of detail or the shifting timelines and the unresolved nature of certain plot developments to be a deterrent, but I find them central components to the creation of a film that has lodged itself in my mind, visually and emotionally, and continues to dwell there.  There is a mystery that comes from a lack of complete understanding, and while some films demand answers to sell their themes and messages, `White Material' is the type of film that can thrive off of audience interpretation of events, and the suddenness of the films conclusion is a spectacular way of making the audience work for an answer; work for their own cinematic satisfaction.  Contemplation and meditation will follow a work as staggering as this one, and it is for that, that I simply cannot recommend this film enough.

It stays with you, and will haunt your dreams.",1310947200,2,3240,4.875912408759124
8413317,4,B0042AEU5K,"<strong>White Material</strong> (Claire Denis, 2009)

Claire Denis has a whole lot to say about Africa, it seems. She's directed a number of movies about Africa, including her best-known works (1988's <em>Chocolat</em> and 2008's <em>35 Shots of Rum</em> bookending the first two decades of her career). 2009's <em>White Material</em> finally showed up in Cleveland a couple of weeks ago, and I got to see a Claire Denis film on the big screen for the first time. And it's a good one. Most of the time, anyway.

Loosely based on <em>The Grass Is Singing</em>, Doris Lessing's first novel, <em>White Material</em> is the story of Maria Vial (<em>The Piano Teacher</em>'s Isabelle Huppert), a coffee farmer in a nameless African country transitioning to independence. Neither the name of the country (Lessing's book is set in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe; the film was shot in Cameroon, as far from Zimbabwe as one can get in sub-Saharan Africa) nor the time period (but it is to be understood that this is an historical, not a contemporary, drama) is given us, but I'm not entirely sure they matter. Maria lives on her family's coffee plantation, effectively running it. With her is her ex-husband Andre (<em>Highlander</em>'s Christopher Lambert), their son Manuel (Denis regular Nicolas Duvauchelle), her ailing father-in-law Henri (<em>Jules et Jim</em>'s Michel Subor), and a cadre of workers. Well, for a few brief moments at the beginning, anyway. As we open, independence is really starting to take hold--as the French army pulls out, the rural areas (read: places where you can stick a coffee plantation) are either under the iron hand of the State, bloody wastelands controlled by the rebels, or scenes of conflict between the two. The workers, who understand which way the wind's blowing, do the wise thing, pack up, and get out--leaving Maria and her family with coffee still on the vine. Five more days, she tells them, and you can go. Not that they're listening, and the rest of the movie's plotline is ""how do we get this coffee harvested?"" But the coffee takes a back seat to the other storylines here. The most compelling is that of The Boxer (<em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em>'s Isaach de Bankole), a rebel leader who stumbles into the Vial plantation, gut-shot during a battle and looking for a place to recuperate. (Whether Maria knows who he is from the get-go or not is subject to debate; I'm on the ""yes"" side, but for no concrete reason.) Then there is Manuel, disaffected youth looking for a thrill, and the relationship between Maria and Andre.

The last of these is given the least amount of time in the film, but it is the most real. It's a relationship that is disintegrating, like the marriage did before it, though not for lack of trying on anyone's part; there is still a real affection between these characters, and had their relationship been taken center stage, this might have been a much better movie than it is. But that is not the way Claire Denis and the film of African liberation work.  Indeed, had any of these storylines taken control of the film save the one that actually does, it might well have been a better film than it is. But again that is not the way, etc. And by saying this I don't mean to declare outright this is a bad film, not by any means. It's far too fragmented in the first twenty minutes, and in the last twenty minutes, and while that makes sense given the subject matter (the country is fractured, and thus depictions of it should be), I can sympathize with those who found it overly artsy or disjointedness for disjointedness' sake. There's an art to keeping that sort of thing coherent. Though off the top of my head I can't think of anyone terribly well-versed in it. Even this movies I've loved that have done this sort of fractured-film thing recently (<em>A Serbian Film</em> jumps to mind) have made me say ""keep going, it'll make sense eventually.""

Here's the problem with Denis' film: there's nowhere to keep going. When I say the fracturing is the last twenty minutes, I mean the last twenty minutes. Then the movie just ends, and I guess the viewer's task is to pick up the pieces given you and make sense of them. To be fair to Denis, two of the four storylines are resolved in a coherent fashion. (The third, the fate of the Boxer, is revealed in the opening scene, as part of the beginning fragmentation of the film; the fourth, the fate of Maria and Andre's relationship, has been sealed long before.) But on the other hand, I look at the coherence in that scene, and the disjointedness of the rest of this part of the film, and it makes me even more frustrated.

But on the other hand, I liked it more than this review would have you believe. I like the sly comic touches, though ""comic"" is perhaps the wrong word; it's a gallows humor, and everyone in the film save the most self-deluded realizes this. Andre is a friend of the Mayor's, and when the Mayor shows off his hand-picked militia, who are going to spirit him out of the country unharmed, the look on Andre's face is classic. (Remember, this is Christopher Lambert you're looking at. Who knew?) It's little touches like that that keep this movie riveting. Of course, the cinematography is spectacular; every time I review a Nollywood flick, I find myself saying the same things about the cinematography (how hard can it be when you go to the edge of the city, walk in a straight line five miles, and you're in some of the most beautiful country on earth?), and they apply here. It's green and lush and dark and scary, even the barren parts. You're in the middle of a burned-out field or walking down a dirt road and there's still no place the green can't simply reach out and swallow you. There's a parallel to be made here about political instability, but I'm currently too tired to make it.

In the end, there is much to recommend about this movie, including some of its most surprising factors. (I keep harping on Christopher Lambert here...) And there are fewer things to not recommend, but the fewer are also the major. You'll have to see it for yourself and decide--which is a recommend, I should think. *** ",1310947200,,6158,4.705936920222634

Claire Dennis shows us a film with certain documental atmosphere, the terrible destiny that awaits for a French family owner of a coffee plantation, who is surrounded more and more until levels of struggling, the intoxicating opression of a political regime, that practices the common game of populism in order to create expectations around thousand and thousand people who expect to improve their horrid social condition.

Dennis handles with firm hand this harrowing script, plenty of compelling stress and tragic finale, when you are not capable to perceive the light at the end of the tunnel.
