3120132,5,B0013XZ6SY,"Although I bought both these sets at Best Buy when they were released, I'm delighted that folks who may have missed out on them can now own these great films on DVD.

To be honest, only a couple of the films might be considered bona-fide sci-fi classics, which occasionally rise above the limitations of typcial fifties ""B"" movie material.  THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is one the most thought-provoking and existential films from the period.  And THE MONOLITH MONSTERS rises above its low budget with some simple yet impressive effects, and better-than-average performances.

TARANTULA and THE DEADLY MANTIS are entertaining parts of the wave of Giant Killer Bug movies that ruled the screens in the 1950's.  MANTIS sports one of the more ridiculously memorable critters of the era.  CULT OF THE COBRA and THE LAND UNKNOWN incorporate the then-popular sub-genre of ""jungle thrills"" into their scripts.

The real oddity of this collection is DR. CYLCOPS.  It's the only film here made in color, and was actually made in the forties.  But the miniaturization effects are first-rate, and are every bit on-par with those of SHRINKING MAN, made some 15 years later.

Rounding out the collection are THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE LEECH WOMAN, and MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS. . .all fine examples of drive-in shocks on a limited budget.  I personally find these three to be the least of the bunch, but there's really not a bad film in the whole collection.

The only extras here are theatrical trailers for most of the films, leading to my only minor complaint: The trailer for SHRINKING MAN is not the famous one narrated by Orson Wells, but a short teaser which really reveals nothing of the film itself.  I've seen the Wells trailer on t.v. many times over the years, so I would think Universal could have gotten their hands on it.  But like I said, it's a minor quibble from an admitted Serious Sci-Fi Geek.

And hey, even if you're NOT a Serious Sci-Fi Geek, this impressive set may just convert you.",1210464000,118,1985,4.814159292035399
3120133,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I am glad this great DVD collection is being repackaged (BOTH previous Sets into ONE superb collectible set!) for those who were not able to have purchased these 2 volumes the first time around as BEST BUY exclusives! I already own the 2 original volumes, so I won't be purchasing this newly packaged set ~ but those who missed out the first time had better grab this little gem ... ASAP! I am not going to offer any reviews of this new product, because it has been well-documented below from many AMAZON customers (GREAT reviews!). If you love those great 50's SCI-FI films, then this is a DVD set you CANNOT BE WITHOUT! There's not a bad one in the bunch!! As with most UNIVERSAL films, these tranfers are extremely clean and will look wonderful on any size screen! Although UNIVERSAL chose not to include any extras (not even one trailer), I am more than satisfied to own all the films in this superb collection! I hope that UNIVERSAL will select another batch of their classic SCI-FI & HORROR treasures for a ""VOLUME 3"" in this series (hopefully for 2008). Here are some great UNIVERSAL films (and PARAMOUNT licensed films) which I would like to see in any forthcoming series: ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, ISLAND OF TERROR, SPIDER WOMAN STRIKES BACK, THE UNINVITED, CRACK IN THE WORLD, SPACE CHILDREN,
HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES, MURDERS AT THE ZOO ... to name only a few.
NOW ~ we can only hope that the spark of these new SCI-FI & HORROR DVD  revivals will ignite renewed interest for further volumes from other companies like COLUMBIA (SAM KATZMAN'S 'ICONS OF HORROR'), FOX HORROR CLASSICS collections, WARNER BROTHERS ('CULT CAMP CLASSICS'), MGM'S MIDNITE MOVIE series, SONY (forgotten Japanese remastered letterboxed classics like: RODAN, BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE, GORATH, THE H-MAN ... etc). Well, you get the idea. Spread the word, buy the DVDs, pop some corn, sit back in your recliner, tune in your mind to those thrilling days of 'yesteryear' ... and enjoy the Hell outta life!

3120134,5,B0013XZ6SY,"The Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection is worth it for just the 'Monolith Monsters"" alone. Together, the collection is a gold mine in sci-fi.

My 12-year son and I first saw ""Monolith Monsters"" (on VHS) with 15 other geologists as evening en-tertainment in a makeshift trailer-theater at the University of California's White Mountain Research Station in Bishop, California. We watched the movie in utter amusement as characters Dave Miller (government geologist), Professor Arthur Flanders and others in the cast spouted one nonsensical aphorism after another, in their attempt to explain the formation of the monoliths and the possible ways of stopping their growth. The movie is one of the best examples of ""Bad Geology"" that I had seen. Even my son pointed out the errors of the movie's finer statements: 1) looking at a piece of Obsidian (a black glassy rock composed of silicon dioxide) that every school kid recognizes, Dave Miller says ""Looks like stone to me"" - duh; 2) theorizing that water makes the rocks grow, the townsfolks decide to flood the monoliths with salt and water. But Obsidian (silicon dioxide) is inert to both salt and water!

Without getting into other specifics of the movie's bad geology, it is clear any halfway intelligent middle school student would have identified the rock. And yet despite some of the funky statements, ""Monolith Monsters"" remains a wholly enjoyable `B' movie. It is `Camp' entertainment for scientists, especially geologists, and is a period piece of Bad Geology - a good movie to watch with colleagues over a beer while making childish insidious remarks. This is high entertainment. If you like the TV program ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", you'll love this movie. It is great that the movie is now out in DVD.",1209427200,3,1756,5.072664359861592

But why do they have to make you work for buying them. I got the first set reasonbly priced,then found out about the second set by chance. Been waiting for the deadly mantis for ever and then they put it out in a volume set when it should be by itself just like the incredible shrinking man. I got the second set on EBAY for alot less than what Best Buy was selling it for. WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY BOUGHT THE FIRST SET? Now you want to sock it to them for both. Maybe they should pay more attention to what people want,enough with the upteen editions of the great universal monster flicks. Start getting some of the other great movies out.

3120139,5,B0013XZ6SY,"Universal has finally seen the folly of their ways in selling this set exclusively via Best Buy and is re-releasing both volumes 1 & 2 in one set. Included are all ten films in the original sets, but once again there will be no extra features - just the films themselves and some trailers. If you love the great campy horror films of the 1950's you'll love this set. The following is from the press release on the new combined set:

The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957, 81 min.)

In a desperate race against time and nature, a geologist and a scientist must find a way to stop effects of killer outer-space rocks that are literally petrifying people with fear!

Monster on the Campus (1958, 76 min)
Terror sweeps a college campus after the discovery of a prehistoric fish that turns animals and humans that come into contact with it into bloodthirsty monsters.

3120157,4,B0013XZ6SY,"This is really a solid collection of sci-fi B-movies (mostly) from the 50s.

It includes one bona-fide classic: THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, written by Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson. Though low-budget, this is a sober, literate reflection on a life made a nightmare when a man is exposed to a mysterious cloud of radiation and starts to shrink. Slowly, all the trappings of a normal life (job, respect, community, house, loved ones) fall away, and our hero must learn to survive in the strange alien world that is his basement floor...while fleeing the clutches of a rather nasty spider. It's worth the price of admission alone.

Falling into the 'Cheezy Fun' category are films like DR. CYCLOPS, THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE LAND UNKNOWN and THE MONOLITH MONSTERS. DR. CYCLOPS is the one film from the 40s in the collection, and the only one in colour. The special effects are quite good for its time, and I very much enjoyed Albert Dekker's portrayal of the titular mad scientist. THE MOLE PEOPLE and THE LAND UNKNOWN both feature adventurers falling into 'lost' worlds. THE MOLE PEOPLE is interesting for the fact that the 'monsters' are actually the good guys, and THE LAND UNKNOWN, with its rubber dinosaurs and atmospheric sets, goes down great with some soda and popcorn. THE MONOLITH MONSTERS is another 'monster from outer space' tale, but with the twist that the 'monsters' are actually...rocks. What seems like a joke is actually sold rather well (they may be slow, but they are unstoppable!) and it's a good way to spend 80 minutes of your time.

MONSTER ON CAMPUS, THE DEADLY MANTIS, TARANTULA, THE LEECH WOMAN and CULT OF THE COBRA are...ok. I hope you like stock footage though, as THE DEADLY MANTIS has a whole lot of it. Fun for people who like this sort of thing, but I wouldn't recommend the set for them. They are nice bonuses to the aforementioned films, though.",1466899200,,1884,4.808641975308642
3120158,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I,too, had bought both sets when they were being sold only at Best Buy as they were only exclusive to that store. However, I will say that all these films, although be it that it may, are campy sci-fi greats of the '50's and 1 film out of 1940,. The special efects and or make-up in every one of these films is exceptional. My least favourite of the batch is Land of The Unknown. It is a rather boring flick if you ask me although I still do think it has sci-fi class if you know what I mean?. What I think I am driving at is that this film used ""TOYS"" for the dinosaurs with hardly any movement at all. But, the story is interesting in it's own weird way. With that being said, this set of parts one and two are very well worth the time and money. Practically all these movies will keep you on the edge of your seat. I remember a few of these watching them in the theatre and getting down under the seat for a couple of them, so I didn't have to see any ugly faces.

I enjoy them very much. They are inexpensive drive-in movies for the teens on dates in the 50s and I still find them a lot of fun to watch even in glorious black and white. On a personal note, my wife had a memory of a movie where some kind of rock creature grew out of someone's sink that scared her when she was a little girl. She never knew if it was a dream, an episode of Outer Limits, or a movie. After 27 years of marriage I was watching a movie in this set called ""The Monolith Monsters"" when she came downstairs. It was right at that point in the movie when the rock monster was growing out of the sink! She couldn't believe it! FINALLY she knew what it was!

3120201,5,B0013XZ6SY,"This is a great collection of 10 very good 'B' Sci-Fi flicks!

So far I've watched the first five -

Tarantula - released 1955 - I had never seen this before - pretty good story with above average acting - some of the special effects were only ok but then this was more than 60 years ago plus they didn't have a ton of money to spend - very good picture and sound.

The Mole People - released 1956- very good story and acting - the first 2 star the King of the B Movies - John Agar (who was married to Shirley Temple for a short while) - John had a very interesting career as at one time it looked like he might be a fairly big star but it just didn't happen - the make-up used shows the lack of funds but otherwise a fun movie - once again very good picture and movie.

The Incredible Shrinking Man - released 1957 - This might the most famous of the first five - good idea fairly well done - pretty good special effects considering the amount of money available and when it was made. The last 30 minutes are really suspenseful as he shrinks down to nothing (starting with family cat attack then a spider, etc) - a little sad that his wife thinks he's dead when he isn't but then all movies can't end happy - can they? I just wish they had shown the entire Orsen Wells trailer instead of the greatly shortened one.

The Monolith Monsters - released 1957 - this is VERY unique idea and movie - very good picture and sound - very good writing and script - with a little more investment and a little longer run time this could have broken into A movie territory. This is far above average Sci-Fi movie that's just short of a classic! I really like this one!

Monster on the Campus - released 1958 - the title suggests drive-in trash BUT the story is a very nice take on Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with a little of The Creature From the Black Lagoon thrown in for good measure - it sounds like a mess but it really isn't! The picture and sound, once again, are very good.

Nothing additional included other than the trailers which is kind of a shame!

I will add to this review once I've watched the 2nd set of 5 movies but so far I would rate this a very solid 8.0 to 8.5 out of 10 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR 1950'S SCI-FI FANS!!!

******************************************************************

######## ADDED 2/10/15 - I watched Dr Cyclops last night as my wife had a meeting at the church once again.

I'm still not real clear on the Dr Cyclops name except toward the end when all of his glasses were hidden or destroyed except for one with the left lens. I felt the name of the movie was very misleading and had NOTHING to do with the story. And since this was a Paramount movie (as many others have pointed out) plus it was in color (which was nice) PLUS it was made way before most of the others (made in 1939 and released in 1940). I'm not sure why it was included in this collection. It was a misfit due to the all of the above plus the storyline didn't really fit either. I didn't really care for this one.

Once again much of the so-called science behind all of the story was poorly explained (at best). Now I admit that mankind was just starting to really experiment with radation (and I yes I know about Marie Curie's work in the late 1800's & Wilhelm Roentgen's work with X-rays during the middle of the 1890's - but much work wasn't done until the 1920's and 30's) in general so that explains part of it. But I never understood WHY the other scientists were even invited or what the 'mad scientist' was even trying to do other than reduce carbon-based life forms in size. Why was he doing that - what was his endgame plans? Nothing seemed to make much sense to me.

The special effects were VERY good especially for 1939 - they would be fairly good even today! Acting ranged from ok to pretty good. Picture was very good and maybe even a little better than that. Sound was very good as well. Plot, on the other hand was a mess and made little sense. And the ending was - well the movie just ended like they ran out of film - or money - or maybe even lost interest - or didn't know how to end it. There were lots of loose ends just left dangling in the breeze. And the Love affair - why was that even in the movie?

This movie rated a ok 5.0 to 6.0 - GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS but that was about all.

***********************************************************************************

Added Tue 1/17 - watched the Deadly Mantis -(released 1957) last night (Mon 1/26/15) - picture still pretty good but there were a few verticle lines and white spots - Story not bad but it took too long to get going - almost felt like a documentary at first - characters were more 'flat' - not as detailed as the ones in the first five - still an interesting film and I'm glad I watched it - sound was very good - had William Hopper from Perry Mason fame as the male lead. This one is a step down in MHO from the 1st five movies.

I would rate this a pretty good 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10 stars - pretty good overall!

**************************************************************************************
ADDED 2/3/15 - Last night my wife had a another meeting so I watched the ""Leech Woman' (released 1960). This was yet another spin on the Stevenson story - Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. However this one was a bit of a mess and needed a rewrite to make certain things clear. I'm not exactly sure what the story was to be about other than a woman obsessed with being young again. It had a segment in Africa that was just strange and could have been handled differently - like maybe a flashback - that would have made things a little 'cleaner' and still advanced the storyline. The pineal gland stuff was utter nonsense. It's only important function in most living things is to produce melatoin which is a seratonin analog. Other than a 'possible' connection to sexual development it has no known connection to aging. And there are a few animals (like a alligator) that don't even have a pineal gland or even a collection of cells that resemble such a gland. It is this kind of stuff that drive me nuts - as a pharmacist I expect major story points to at least make some sense

OK - now that you have much more information about a gland most people have never even heard of we will move on.

Picture and sound were very good. Story not so much but still interesting - would rate this a good for a B movie 6.0 to 6.5 out of 10 - well worth watching at least once. In more capable hands this could have been a very interesting movie well worth watching more than once instead of something lessor that just misses the mark.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************
On Monday my wife had yet another meeting at the church so I watched the 'The Land Unknown'. It was fairly good but, as several other movies in the set, was fairly slow moving. But overall the movie was pretty good and the special effects were surprisingly good - expecially for such a old B movie.

I would rate this mildly surprisingly film a fairly good movie - 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10 - recommended!",1422144000,10,7160,4.433028919330289

3120254,4,B0013XZ6SY,"This is packaged like many of those ""50 Sci-Fi Movies In One Box!"" sets (usually all public domain titles), however, this is really a solid collection of Universal Studios mid to low budget sci-fi films from the fifties. Most of these have been released on either VHS or Laserdisc, but never bundled together on DVD.

And I have to say, the DVD transfers are great--these films have never looked so clear & crisp. The Deadly Mantis, The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Mole People, etc.--I saw them all on tv as a kid, but usually on old scratched prints with muddy sound. Seeing pristine prints, just like the day they opened in the theater, really changes the quality of the viewing experience.

Speaking of quality, they all feature performances from solid Universal players like Nestor Paiva & Les Tremayne and excellent special effects photography (when the budget allows) from cinematographer Clifford Stine--who worked on virtually every one these films. Producer Jack Arnold always tries to keep the stories logical enough to suspend your disbelief and in this collection it's hit & miss, but overall very enjoyable stuff.

You won't find most of these movies released separately, but if you're like me, (I was looking for a DVD of The Monolith Monsters) you're bound to have more than one you want to see--and this is really the only way to get them.",1403481600,10,1357,4.891304347826087

2. 4 discs with 2 films and 2 discs with 1 film each. Give me 2 more movies and I might overlook the ""ultimate"" thing.
3. I would also have enjoyed screaming lady faces on all the discs as well.

Those things aside; the films were diverse yet well matched. Big bugs and little people. Lands lost and found. People turning into creatures and rocks turning into bigger rocks, John Agar, Faith Domergue, Mara Corday, and Gloria Talbott. Jack Arnold. These were the friends people like me grew up with and still love today.

The quality was, well, it was the best I'd ever seen these films. I plan to enjoy these films often and with as many friends as are willing to watch with me.",1402790400,,744,4.345323741007194
3120258,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I was not old enough to have seen these movies in the theater. I grew up through the 60s watching a local Saturday afternoon TV show called Monster Movie Matinee, especially in Winter. Don't get me wrong, I loved being out in the snow, but by 1PM I'd had enough and in I'd come to curl up on the couch. Just as I like my mono 45rpm's, I still love black and white movies. The print for each of these is fantastic. What made the whole set even more enjoyable was only vaguely recalling half. Despite reports, TV wasn't always Frankenstein, Dracula or the Mummy. NOTE: Though there are mostly two movies per disk, these are not the cheaper two-sided disks and the packaging was of sufficient quality. I'm glad I purchased the combined volumes 1 & 2.
There are enough other, more detailed reviews. I'm adding mine for one reason and it's the most intriguing thing I found about this set. In 2011 I discovered a cable show called Face Off (unfortunately not available for purchase). This is a reality show that has fantasy makeup artists compete. Let me say here I like sci-fi, but I know very little technically, so I would not normally be interested in this type show. It is hosted by McKenzie Westmore. This season (2014) her father, Michael, has taken on a larger role of advisor. He is so knowledgeable I wish he were in the whole show. Okay, here's where my stupidity surfaces. I had never heard of the famous Westmore family of makeup artists and sort of wondered who this guy was.
So now to the point. I buy this movie set, mostly for Tarantula and Dr. Cyclops and I find six other true gems (and two watchable but lower budget ones), and I spot the make-up credit on the first, then the second, all the way through the tenth. They are all Bud Westmore, Michael's uncle. (Thanks Wikipedia) He also did Creature From the Black Lagoon. I would never call these B Movies and Bud is no slouch. Check out the increasingly gruesome makeup during Tarantula. Each is interesting and beautifully filmed and edited. No one gets slashed. Nothing blows up. Nobody visits Hell. Sorry kids. It makes me wonder why I bother with 300 cable channels of the same rehashed garbage.
So, whether you grew up on monster movies or are a fan of modern sci-fi looking for a bit of history, I am completely satisfied I now own these. Could you hit the lights on the way out?",1398556800,2,2352,4.484848484848484
3120259,4,B0013XZ6SY,"Actually, The Deadly Mantis is also good. And The Incredible Shrinking Man is also very well done as is The cult of the Cobra, which has a lot of suspense. But the Mole People, the Monolith Monsters and the Land Unknown to me are awful and I will probably never which them again. Of course that leaves Dr Cyclops, which was made in 1940 way before any of the rest of these films and the only one in color. And has for its time just as good special affects as Shrinking Man. But it does not fit at all as it was made many years before any of the other films and so it simply doesn""t belong here. Although it is well made and enjoyable. That leaves my favorites-led by Monster on the Campus with Arthur Franz. I saw this as a teenager in 1958 and it scared me a lot. Still love it! Next comes Tarantula which to me was the best of the bug movies after the great Them from 1954. Was great fun watching it again. Last but not least is the Leech Woman, which stars the beautiful Coleen Gray,who needs to kill to look young. Besides starring in several film noirs of the late 1940s and early 1950s she starred with John Beal in a very scary film called  the Vampire from 1957.

Mole People literally leaves you with a taste for dirt in your mouth. Incredible Shrinking Man was disturbing..he should have eaten much better. Monolith Monsters (my fave) the monster killers are skyscraper sized rocks, I mean cmon!!! Monster on Campus was hilarious! Leech Woman sucked. Deadly Mantis was cool, nothing like watching cars being crushed in the big old loving arms of a bug.  Land Unknown had dinosaurs aplenty!

When I saw that not only is Leech Woman available in dvd now, its in a collection with some of my other favorites, especially the Incredible Shrinking Man!  I ordered it immediately.  One reviewer complained about not some of the dvds being defective.  I had a similar problem with other new dvds but a guy at Best  Buys geek squad told me to get a dvd cleaner disk.  Sometimes even new dvds have dust on them.  I did that and the ""defective"" dvds play now with no problem.

I have a few complaints about this collection: first only Tarantula, Incredible Shrinking Man, Dr. Cyclops and the Leech Woman came anywhere close to science fiction. When I think science fiction I think flying saucers, outer space, laser guns. Most of the movies are just B movie monsters. Also the only extra you get are the trailers for each movie; no coming attractions or film commentary. This collection fell way below my expectation of science fiction movies. The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, Volumes 1 & 2 gets a B- for misleading the public.

VOLUME 1
6 hour 31 minutes

Disc 1

Tarantula! Is one hour and twenty - one minutes and was released in theaters on December 14, 1955. Professor Gerald Deemer and his two associates are working on a formula to prevent world hunger but the when they tests the formula on animals it make them grow several times their size. One day when the professor is out, his two associates try the formula on them selves and develop runaway acromegaly. Both of them die within four days after injecting themselves, however one of them goes mad and wreck the lab and injects Professor Gerald Deemer with the formula while he is unconscious. Unknown to Professor Deemer a giant tarantula escapes and wreck havoc on the town. It is up to the local and state police to stop this spider.

The Mole People is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theaters in December of 1956. A group of archaeologists are on a dig when they discover a stone tablet and buy an old oil lamp with some ancient writings. They decide to climb the mountain to find more artifacts and when they get to the top one of the archaeologists fall through a hole. Of the five men that went down the hole, including the one who fell, three live and find the lost city of the Sumerian people. The three are capture are and to be sentence to die. They escape death and try to find a way out of there. Besides rescuing some mole people from being tortured that is the gist of the movie. A footnote or two about this movie: one you might recognize Alan Napier as the Elinu, the High Priest. He went on to play Alfred in the sixties television show Batman. Second get a good look at Dr. Jud Bellamin; that is Hugh Beaumont who played Ward Cleaver in Leave It To Beaver.

Disc 2

The Incredible Shrinking Man is one hour and twenty - one minutes and was released on February 22, 1957. The main story is Scott and Carey Williams are on vacation on a boat cruise somewhere off the coast of California. When Carey goes down below to get Scott a beer, a strange radiation cloud passes through the boat and Scott gets that mist on him. Six months later he notices he is getting smaller the doctor that he first saw sends him to the California Medical Research Institute for three weeks of tests. The come up with an antidote that they think will prevent him from getting smaller. It works for a little while until he starts to get smaller again. The special effects in this movie are great for its day. The only thing is I wished it had a better ending.

The Monolith Monsters is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theaters in December 1957. The movie takes place in a town call San Angelo, California. Over a billion years ago a meteorite has landed on Earth and in present day is growing. The meteor rocks fossilize anybody that mixes it with water. The town has just had a rain storm and the rocks are growing at an enormous rate. It is up to the town geologist and a doctor to come up with a solution or watch their town gets destroyed. The amazing thing about this movie there are really no monsters in this movie.

Disc 3

A coelacanth fish is brought to a university and anyone who gets infected by that fish devolves into a primitive being. Professor Donald Blake accidently cuts himself on the fish and turns into a cave like person and when the drug wears off he has killed a person and has no memory of what he did. This happens two more time to him, one by a freak accident and the other during a test on himself to see if he is that monster. Professor Donald Blake finds out that he is the monster doing the killing.

VOLUME 2
6 hours and 28 minutes

Disc 1

Dr. Cyclops is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released on April 20, 1940. To put this movie in the cliff note version Dr. Alexander Thorkel (Dr. Cyclops) has discovered a mine of pitchblende that he is using to test animals on and shrinking them. The three scientists, Dr. Cyclops hired help, and the mule guide find out about this. Dr. Alexander Thorkel traps all five of them in his radiation chamber and shrinks them all down to Barbie doll size. The five escape and try to stay alive until they are all normal size once again. Dr. Cyclops was the first science fiction movie to use Technicolor film.

Cult of the Cobra is one hour and nineteen minutes and was released in theaters on May 30, 1955. Six army men are on leave in Asia before they return home from World War II. They witness a secret Laminas' ceremony where a female changes into a cobra. They are discovered and flee for their lives. The High Priest yells to them as they are escaping the temple that all six that ""the Cobra Goddess will avenge herself"". One by one the six army men begin to die. The first one in Asia and then once back in the United States the others begin to die by the Cobra Goddess.

Disc 2

The Land Unknown is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters in August of 1957. The movie is about and expedition over Antarctica where there is an unusual warm body of water. They are called back to the ship due to a storm coming. They are running low on gas and try to go through the storm. The helicopter is hit by a pterodactyl and the helicopter start to descend below sea level. The crew lands in a volcanic crater somewhere in the dinosaur age. There they struggle to survive and fix the helicopter.

The Deadly Mantis is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in May of 1957. Basically somewhere in the South Seas there is a volcanic explosion and the effects are felt all the way to the North Pole. This effect melts the ice around a million or two year old mantis. The mantis goes on an eating spree; I guess I would be hungry if I did not have a bite for over a million years. It finally makes it way to the United States like all B Movie monsters do. The only time we actually see the whole mantis move at once is when we watch scale the Washington Monument. Sort of remind you when King Kong climbs the Empire State Building.

Disc 3

The Leech Woman is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theatres in May of 1960. An old woman comes into Dr. Paul Talbot's office and claims she is 140 years old and tells him the secret of her only if he pays for her trip back to Africa. Dr. Talbot witnesses the transformation and takes his not so beautiful with him to Africa so she can be a test subject. When the guide, Dr. Talbot and Mrs. Talbot are capture and brought to the village where orchid pollen is grown they meet old Malla and three later witnesses the ceremony where old Malla becomes a young woman. Malla tell the three that they can have everything they want except their freedom. Dr. Talbot asks that Malla makes his wife young again and June finds out the real reason at last why she was brought to Africa and she chooses her husband as the person to be sacrifice for his pineal gland secretions. June is made young and she and the guide escape from the village. The rest of the movie June kills men to keep her young until she is caught.",1365638400,4,7953,4.347708894878706

3120297,3,B0013XZ6SY,"I've seen nearly every classic B grade sci-fi and horror movie ever made and I absolutely love the genre, but I'm being perfectly honest when I say that this collection is massively overpriced and not that great except for one movie, The Incredible Shrinking Man. Depending on how dedicated you are to the genre, it might be worth it to you to buy these, but there are much better campy classics out there than what you will find in this collection. The best movie in the collection is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" which really is a masterpiece of the time period, but most of the other selections are average or worse. ""Monolith Monsters"" and ""Tarantula"" are certainly watchable, but depending on how entertained you are by fairly boring low budget thrillers will determine whether you will want to watch the rest. I would skip ""The Land Unknown"", ""Cult of the Cobra"", and ""The Mole People"" altogether.

For the most part these movies are not top sci-fi selections of the 1940s-60s and really not classics in any sense, except for The Incredible Shrinking Man and maybe Tarantula, but the rest aren't even really recognized cult favorites. Quite honestly you will get more campy cheesiness out of the 50 Movie Horror Packs which include such genuine cult classics as The Night of the Living Dead, The Brain that Wouldn't Die, The Last Man on Earth, Maniac, the original Little Shop of Horrors and The House on Haunted Hill (the old 2005 packs also include Robot Monster and Wasp Woman which are both awful but entertaining cheese).

3120316,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I don't even know where to begin with this truly classic collection.  Featuring nine Universal films from the 1950s (plus one out of place Paramount film from 1940), included on the set are some of my favorite 50s Sci-Fi/Horror films.

Tarantula (1955, 5 stars) follows a small town doctor, his atomic research scientist girlfriend, and a giant tarantula.  Surpassed only by AIP's Earth vs. the Spider in the giant arachnid genre, the film features a brief early cameo by Clint Eastwood.

Even more impressive is The Deadly Mantis (1957, 5 stars), which along with Warner Brothers' Them, is one of my two favorite giant insect films of all time.  The Deadly Mantis features a giant prehistoric relative of the common praying mantis going up against the US military and a paleontologist.

Neither Tarantula nor The Deadly Mantis is the traditional Atomic Age monster fare, though both feature giant monsters neither was the result of an atomic weapon.  In fact, the only film in the collection to feature an atomic ""menace"" is The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957, 4 stars), directed by Jack Arnold from Richard Matheson's book The Shrinking Man, in which a radioactive mist causes a businessman to slowly shrink into nothingness.

Other noteworthy offerings on the collection include The Mole People (1956, 3 stars) a sci-fi jaunt about an underground civilization; The Land That Time Forgot rip-off The Land Unknown (1957, 3 stars); The Monolith Monsters (1957, 4 stars), about rocks that grow when in contact with water.

While not the worst film on the collection, that honor goes to Jack Arnold's Monster on the Campus (1958, 2 stars, but kinda fun), Paramount's Dr. Cyclops (1940, 3 stars) is the sets true letdown.  It simply feels wrong for the collection.  Despite being the oldest film on the set (fifteen years older than the next oldest), it is the only color entry.  It also falls short of the usual level of fun expected from Universal's films.  Its spot would have be better filled by something from Universal's own cannon, 1955's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Island-Earth/dp/B000FVQLKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Island Earth</a>&nbsp;perhaps.

Rounding out the collection are two weaker entries Cult of the Cobra (1955, 3 stars) and The Leech Woman (1959, 3 stars).

Noteworthy actors to appear on this collection include Eastwood, Richard Long, Jack Kelly (Bart Maverick), scream queen Gloria Talbott, Troy Donahue, Grant Williams, Hugh Beaumont (Leave it to Beaver's Ward Cleaver), Faith Domergue, David Janssen, John Agar, Universal regular Nestor Paiva, Leo G. Carroll, Paul L. Smith, and Alan Napier (Alfred from Batman).  Also, Orson Wells narrates the trailer for The Incredible Shrinking Man but does not appear in the film.

The set is light on special features, containing trailers for all 10 films but nothing else.  Perhaps the Universal Legacy collection was just spoiled me, but I would have loved to see a documentary or two and commentaries on at least the bigger films (Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula, Deadly Mantis).

3120335,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I will review the 2 films in Vol. 1

Some of the reviews have called these films ""campy."" They were nothing of the sort. If they were ""campy"" then, then I suggest that Star Wars, Star Trek and some of our contemporary sci-fi movies are campy as well.

The problem with innovative techniques in either films or technology is that, whereas they are initially hailed as revolutionary and ingenious, after a few decades of improvements, they are seen as boring and contemptible by people (look at the Wright Brothers' plane, the Mercury capsule, the telephone, the model T-ford) and become unappreciated for what they were and what they achieved. This goes especially so in movies. With today's technology, the modern version of King Kong makes the old, original, one laughable to dullards. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was a superbly made sci-fi movie about a man on a private boat that comes into contact with a mysterious cloud over the ocean. In the weeks to come he begins to shrink smaller and smaller and begins to live in a child's doll house, until ultimately, towards the end of the movie, he is the size of an insect. The movie's emphasis is on his, and his wife's, coping with the condition. At the end, he becomes aware that size is relative and while he is tiny by human standards, by other standards, he is gigantic. The film ends optimistically and one gets the impression that he will set out on new adventures into the molecular level.

The other film, badly titled ""The Monolith Monsters,"" is a cerebral sci-fi with almost no special effects, so that some viewers will find it boring. The plot is simple, yet chilling: a meteor crashes into the desert, exploding into pieces. They are picked up by the curious and when the pieces come into contact with water, they expand exponentially. In doing so they absorb the water content of any living organism that they come into contact with. The protagonists attempt to solve the mystery but as rare rain showers approach, catastrophe is imminent.

Both films' plots and characterization were very good.",1308096000,9,2064,4.805633802816901

I don't have much money now, so I am dissapointed that it's only offerred in this large, and largely worthless, collection. The Mole People is not typical ""campy"" 50's sci fi. It's interesting and intelligent, with wonderful and creative script, sets, costumes, make-up, acting, and even, like the narrator says at the begining, a message for all of us. I think some talented, blacklisted people found themselves working on this low-budget, B-movie type project and put their best into it regardless. So if you have money to throw away on the rest of the silly trash in the collection, by all means buy it for this one gem.",1307491200,6,752,4.4963503649635035
3120337,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I am amazed the Incredible Shrinking Man is not available by itself - rather than packaged with a buinch of lessser Sci Fi grindhouse movies from the 1950s.

It and ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are the supreme trilogy of 1950s Sci Fi. In 2009, it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant and will be preserved for all time.

The Incredible Shrinking Man towers above any remakes or take offs for two main reasons. The most convincing special effects possible (most everything was real physical objects - no digital - from a huge mouse trap to a match box big enough to live in) and story you may NEVER forget.

It is way more than a story of a ""shrinking man"". It is the story of a man who discovers a truth we all seek. An indefinable truth - the one way down in your heart - deep inside....

He discovers it through heartbreak, losing all those he loves and cares about, suffering incredible indignity and physical pain, even having his beloved pet turn on him and see him as nothing as a piece of meat.

But through survival - he discovers something very amazing... A common thread in all creatures and huimanity.

In the end our shrinking man is as large as anyone can possibly be. A true ""expanding man"".

In my opinion Grant Willams performance is Oscar worthy. He really knocks it out of the park and leaves you absolutely convinced that all this is really happening to him

Getting smaller:
""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" - The title says it all.  Its sets and props are completely believable.
""Dr. Cyclops"" -  Obsessively secretive about his work, the optically-challenged inventor relishes shrinking prying snoops.

Getting larger:
""Tarantula"" - This gargantuan spider looks better than the big ants in ""Them"" or the huge locust in ""Beginning of the End"".
""The Monolith Monsters"" - Dark, glossy, shards of a meteorite grow and multiply, threatening to crush a desert town.

Prehistoric creatures:
""The Deadly Mantis"" - A gigantic praying mantis, trapped in a glacier, thaws out.  Luckily, there is only one; it eats humans.
""Monster on the Campus"" - The water from a thawing extinct fish, if touched, causes regression to a primeval form.
""The Land Unknown"" - Polar dinosaurs!  The swimming dinosaur looks the fiercest.  The lethargic T-rex looks the silliest.

Hidden societies:
""The Mole People"" - An ancient society, deep in the Earth, survives under austere conditions.
""Cult of the Cobra"" - A secret society worships a charming young woman who can morph into a deadly hooded snake.
""The Leech Woman"" - A jungle tribe can rejuvenate a woman, but unfortunately, in order to do it, a man must die.

Overall: These movies fall in the 3 to 5 rating range.  The most fun to watch is ""The Monolith Monsters"" and the most polished film is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"".",1285718400,,1524,5.163265306122449

Some, like THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, TARANTULA, and THE DEADLY MANTIS are responsible for much of my own love of monsters and radioactive catastrophes. Others, such as THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE MONOLITH MONSTERS, and CULT OF THE COBRA gave me joyous nightmares as a wide-eyed kid! Now, I finally get them all in one gigantic collection! Plus, DR. CYCLOPS, THE LAND UNKNOWN, THE LEECH WOMAN, and MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS (movies I'd longed to see all my life, but missed) are tossed in for good measure! Universal has thankfully allowed their creaky vaults to open once more, unleashing these welcome horrors from times past.

Credit should be given to Universal Studios for putting out collections like this. The quality of the prints are first rate. I remember when it first came out on laser disc years ago and have regretted not buying it then. When I saw this on Amazon I knew I had to make up for that past mistake. My favorites in this collection are Cult Of The Cobra and The Land Unknown. The only movie that didn't age well, in my opinion, was The incredible Shrinking Man, which is disappointing since it was one of my faves as a kid.

This is fun to watch late at night with a storm brewing outside. I also like ""The Mole People"" for the story & watching Hugh Beaumont in something besides ""Leave it to Beaver"".

3120383,5,B0013XZ6SY,"Volumes one and Two of the Universal Science Fiction sets, that were once available for a limited time at Best Buy retailers are now avialable in one wonderful set for a decent price. Many of the films featured on here are Monster movie favorites ranging from Classic to mediocre, but not really a less than entertaining one in the bunch.

The films include:
Tarantula(1955)-Clearly an imitation of the superior, ""Them!(1954)"", this film is the best of it's rip-offs featuring a good cast led by Sci-Fi stalwart, John Agar and the ultra hot, Mara Corday. The effects are quite good in this one and the subplot involving the experiments of the doctor who made the Tarantula is actually interesting. It's also fun to see Clint Eastwood as the Fighter Pilot who drops napalm on the Tarantula at the end! A good effort from Universal.

The Mole People(1957)-Mediocre effort with interesting plot, involves a few archaeologists who get stranded underground and discover a lost civilization of albinos(!) who have enslaved a race of mole people(!) and there growing rebellion. The Mole people are pretty cool looking but the film is burdened by a lack of action and a out of place, downbeat ending.

The Incredible Shrinking Man(1957)-The best film on the set and one of the best Science Fiction films ever made. Grant Williams is excellent as a man exposed to a strange radiation that causes him to shrink mysteriously. A thought provoking script by the great, Richard Matheson and surefire direction by Sci-Fi favorite, Jack Arnold combine to make this an all-time classic. Great effects, too!

The Monolith Monsters(1957)-The award for weirdest Monster concept goes to this moody thriller about mysterious rocks from space that have a life of there own, taking in the body fluids of people and turning them to stone. They also grow giant if exposed to water. Ooh-Oh. Surprisngly tense and well acted, this one is the sleeper of the set.

Monster on the Campus(1958)-Preposterous film has Doctor Arthur Franz recieve a Cyleocanth and finding that exposure to it's blood causes one to revert to a primordial state! So this includes a German Shepherd becoming a ""wolf""(he's just wearing fangs, kids) a giant dragonfly and Franz turning into a ape man!(the same make-up that make-up artist recycled WAY too many times from Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde(1952). Well directed and Franz is sympathetic, but strictly average.

Dr. Cyclops(1940)-Bizarre film that is totally out of place on this set. It's the only Color film. It's the only film not made by Universal(it's made by Paramount) and it's made in 1940! Why is it on here? Who knows. However, it IS an actual Science Fiction film as opposed to a Monster film and is actually pretty good. Albert Dekker makes a memorable mad scientist, experimenting with ways of shrinking people and animals. Great effects from the director of the original King Kong(1933). It's not a classic , but very entertaining little adventure film nonetheless.

Cult of the Cobra(1955)-Noir influences abound on this sleeper about American GIs who witness a strange ritual where beautiful women become cobras(!). The soldiers break up the cult and escape, only to have one of the lethal babes on there trail, picking them off one by one. Faith Domergue is gorgeous as the exotic femme fatale, but is not a great actress. Marshall Thompson, a vet of Sci-Fi classics, fares better. The romance between the two adds a level of tragedy to the film that keeps this Monster flick above average.

The Land Unknown(1955)-Universal makes there own ""lost World: adventure flick with this entertaining little feature about a helicopter crew that crash land in an arctic jungle land, where dinosaurs lurk! The effects are fun and the acting is adequate(Though leading lady Shawn Smith should have STAYED a brunette. She was way younger looking in It, The Terror From Beyond Space(1958). The film never seems to gain any momentum, though and when compared to the best of it's type, remains just mediocre. The sets are cool, though and it looks nice in widescreen. Enjoyable, but no classic.

The Deadly Mantis(1957)-Very fun Monster Movie about a GIANT prehistoric Mantis unleashed from the ice in the Arctic attacking an army base and than Washington! The effects are first rate and some scenes are genuinely chilling(that scene with the Mantis appearing out of the fog, swallowing a bus on a road is right out of a nightmare) and the climax is a good one. The romantic sub-plot between Craig Stevens and Alix Talton is actually funny and enjoyable, rather than distracting. This is one of the more underrated Monster movies of the period.

The Leech Woman(1960)-Sort-of hilarious satire(in a way) on female vanity has Colleen Grey afraid of losing her looks, so she goes on a sfari to obtain a magic powder to make herself beautiful once more. However, it's only temporary and she needs blood to stay young! The actress is quite good in this, but the film never quite rises above it's material with the amount of drama and wit that could have made this a minor classic. In otherwords, it's just okay.

This is one fun set of Monster Movies and is reccomended to both B-Movie hecklers and serious genre fans, since there is a nice mixture of the two and both parties will have many pleasant surprises. Some may appear corny, others may feel dated, but the entertainment value has not diminshed from these classics one bit.

3120386,5,B0013XZ6SY,"In the early days of talkie films, many of the major studios carved out their own niches:  MGM did the spectacular movies and the musicals, Warner Brothers did the social issue and gangster movies and Universal did the monster movies.  By the 1950s, Frankenstein and company were generally played out, so Universal switched from the supernatural to the ""scientific"" monsters.  These films were for the most part B-movie fare and generally fun, but also formulaic enough to merit parody, most notably on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  In fact, at least three of the ten movies in The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection were redone on MST3K.

These ten movies fit into four categories, each with two or three films:  the big, the small, the lost and the shifty.  The ""big"" films deal with oversized monsters:  Tarantula, The Monolith Monsters and The Deadly Mantis.  Tarantula, one of three in the set directed by Jack Arnold (of Creature of the Black Lagoon fame) deals with an oversized arachnid that terrorizes a small town.  Guns can't stop it, dynamite can't stop it:  is the world doomed?  B movie stalwart John Agar leads the cast, while Clint Eastwood appears briefly in one of his earliest roles (His first role?  A cameo in Revenge of the Creature (not part of this set)).  The Deadly Mantis (parodied on MST3K) features a thawed out giant insect that heads south from the Arctic.  The Monolith Monster feature the monster that is simultaneously the most interesting and the most boring:  giant rocks that tear up the landscape and multiply when wet.

The ""small"" films are the closest to classics in the bunch.  Dr. Cyclops is unique in this set for three reasons:  it is not only the only one not made by Universal (but by Paramount instead), it is the only one not made in the 1950s (it was made in 1940) and it is the only one in color.  The story focuses on the title character, a mad scientist who creates a device that can shrink animals, including some people who get too close to his secrets.  The Incredible Shrinking Man has the title character facing doom as he gets smaller and smaller, ultimately winding up in mortal battle with a spider.

The ""lost"" films deal with lost worlds.  The Mole People (another MST3K victim) has archaeologists (including future Ward Beaver Hugh Beaumont) finding an ancient Sumerian civilization living underground.  They are distrusful of outsiders, but are so sensitive to light that a flashlight is blinding and sunlight can kill.  The Land Unknown has a group of people finding a lost world in Antarctica, complete with dinosaurs and carnivorous plants.

The ""shifty"" movies deal with people transforming into beasts.  In Monster on the Campus, the main character changes into a primitive savage after being ""bitten"" by the fossil of an ancient fish.  In Cult of the Cobra (the one really supernatural movie in the bunch), some ex-soldiers run afoul of the title group, which sends a woman after them, one who can transform at will into a cobra.  Finally, The Leech Woman has a middle-aged woman who can turn young briefly, but only if she kills.  Despite being another film that MST3K spoofed, it does stand out in one respect:  it stars B-movie beauty Coleen Gray.  While the actresses in the other films are little more than eye candy who scream at appropriate times, Gray is exceptional in her more human character.  It is little wonder that Gray is the only actress in the set to have a decent career (including films like Kiss of Death, Nightmare Alley, Kansas City Confidential and The Killing).

It'd be a little much to say these are great movies, but they are all fun to watch.  The low-budget effects, the cheesy writing (except for the Richard Matheson penned Incredible Shrinking Man) and the often wooden acting do not hurt these films but somehow enhance them.  There aren't many extras (only movie trailers), but this is still a nice set, and with no movie topping 81 minutes, these films are quick and entertaining.",1230336000,61,3988,4.82179675994109

Though the inclusion of ""Cult Of The Cobra"" is a puzzle (it's really a supernatural horror story), by in large, a majority of the films are quite enjoyable and the print quality is excellent on all of them.

Personal favs in the collection are ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""The Monolith Monsters"", ""Tarantula"" (keep an eye open for a VERY young Clint Eastwood as an Air Force pilot), ""Monster On Campus"" & ""The Deadly Mantis"".

""Dr. Cyclops"" is the oldest of the set being released in 1940. Though the effects are somewhat dated, the plot holds your interest unlike the abysmal ""Leech Woman"". I've always wondered why collections such as these are seemingly required to include a 'dog' like ""The Leech Woman"" though I suppose on one level it helps one to appreciate the others.

Small trivia to look out for. The script for ""The Land Unknown"" was scripted by radio script writer William N. Robson trying his hand at a screenplay.

3120425,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I wanted to write a review on the movie ""Monolith Monsters"" but this was the only place I coud find it.  Upon seeing the titles here, it reminded me of the local Twin Cities show ""Horror Inclorporated"" which aired on Friday nights when I was a kid.  These movies are corny, poorly written and acted, not worth packaging as individual films, but kind of fun to watch.

As said, I'm particularly drawn to Monolith Monsters because I can't help but think of how it is a critique of modern urban society.  These monolithic rocks grow to skyscraper height when they come in contact with water.  Anyone who touches them turns to stone.  How similar it is to our modern culture.  We build cities out of nothing (usually based on some nearby natural resource or other reason) with buildings that reach to the sky.  The contents of those buildings is the ideas that make our society achieve, though often it can be very impersonal.  If one becomes to caught up in the machinations of our society (always striving to get ahead or needed to keep up with the Joneses) you can turn to stone (figuratively, not literally).  In time the resource disappears and the reason for the city or the culture disppears as well (think of all the world empires that are now ""ruins"").  Thus the monoliths move onto somewhere else leaving behind something for the historians or archaeologists to ponder.

Anyway, I realize this is kind of a stretch, but I can't not think of this analogy when I think of ""Monolith Monsters"" and I'm glad it has been included in this corny movie collection.",1219017600,5,1561,4.636363636363637

And then there's ""Curuccu, Beast Of The Amazon"", not a great film but still fun and still unreleased.

To be honest, only a couple of the films might be considered bona-fide sci-fi classics, which occasionally rise above the limitations of typcial fifties ""B"" movie material.  THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is one the most thought-provoking and existential films from the period.  And THE MONOLITH MONSTERS rises above its low budget with some simple yet impressive effects, and better-than-average performances.

TARANTULA and THE DEADLY MANTIS are entertaining parts of the wave of Giant Killer Bug movies that ruled the screens in the 1950's.  MANTIS sports one of the more ridiculously memorable critters of the era.  CULT OF THE COBRA and THE LAND UNKNOWN incorporate the then-popular sub-genre of ""jungle thrills"" into their scripts.

The real oddity of this collection is DR. CYLCOPS.  It's the only film here made in color, and was actually made in the forties.  But the miniaturization effects are first-rate, and are every bit on-par with those of SHRINKING MAN, made some 15 years later.

Rounding out the collection are THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE LEECH WOMAN, and MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS. . .all fine examples of drive-in shocks on a limited budget.  I personally find these three to be the least of the bunch, but there's really not a bad film in the whole collection.

The only extras here are theatrical trailers for most of the films, leading to my only minor complaint: The trailer for SHRINKING MAN is not the famous one narrated by Orson Wells, but a short teaser which really reveals nothing of the film itself.  I've seen the Wells trailer on t.v. many times over the years, so I would think Universal could have gotten their hands on it.  But like I said, it's a minor quibble from an admitted Serious Sci-Fi Geek.

And hey, even if you're NOT a Serious Sci-Fi Geek, this impressive set may just convert you.",1210464000,118,1985,4.814159292035399

I already own the 2 original volumes, so I won't be purchasing this newly packaged set ~ but those who missed out the first time had better grab this little gem ... ASAP! I am not going to offer any reviews of this new product, because it has been well-documented below from many AMAZON customers (GREAT reviews!). If you love those great 50's SCI-FI films, then this is a DVD set you CANNOT BE WITHOUT! There's not a bad one in the bunch!! As with most UNIVERSAL films, these tranfers are extremely clean and will look wonderful on any size screen! Although UNIVERSAL chose not to include any extras (not even one trailer), I am more than satisfied to own all the films in this superb collection! I hope that UNIVERSAL will select another batch of their classic SCI-FI & HORROR treasures for a ""VOLUME 3"" in this series (hopefully for 2008). Here are some great UNIVERSAL films (and PARAMOUNT licensed films) which I would like to see in any forthcoming series: ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, ISLAND OF TERROR, SPIDER WOMAN STRIKES BACK, THE UNINVITED, CRACK IN THE WORLD, SPACE CHILDREN,
HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES, MURDERS AT THE ZOO ... to name only a few.
NOW ~ we can only hope that the spark of these new SCI-FI & HORROR DVD  revivals will ignite renewed interest for further volumes from other companies like COLUMBIA (SAM KATZMAN'S 'ICONS OF HORROR'), FOX HORROR CLASSICS collections, WARNER BROTHERS ('CULT CAMP CLASSICS'), MGM'S MIDNITE MOVIE series, SONY (forgotten Japanese remastered letterboxed classics like: RODAN, BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE, GORATH, THE H-MAN ... etc).

3354631,5,B0013XZ6SY,"The Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection is worth it for just the 'Monolith Monsters"" alone. Together, the collection is a gold mine in sci-fi.

My 12-year son and I first saw ""Monolith Monsters"" (on VHS) with 15 other geologists as evening en-tertainment in a makeshift trailer-theater at the University of California's White Mountain Research Station in Bishop, California. We watched the movie in utter amusement as characters Dave Miller (government geologist), Professor Arthur Flanders and others in the cast spouted one nonsensical aphorism after another, in their attempt to explain the formation of the monoliths and the possible ways of stopping their growth. The movie is one of the best examples of ""Bad Geology"" that I had seen. Even my son pointed out the errors of the movie's finer statements: 1) looking at a piece of Obsidian (a black glassy rock composed of silicon dioxide) that every school kid recognizes, Dave Miller says ""Looks like stone to me"" - duh; 2) theorizing that water makes the rocks grow, the townsfolks decide to flood the monoliths with salt and water. But Obsidian (silicon dioxide) is inert to both salt and water!

Without getting into other specifics of the movie's bad geology, it is clear any halfway intelligent middle school student would have identified the rock. And yet despite some of the funky statements, ""Monolith Monsters"" remains a wholly enjoyable `B' movie. It is `Camp' entertainment for scientists, especially geologists, and is a period piece of Bad Geology - a good movie to watch with colleagues over a beer while making childish insidious remarks. This is high entertainment. If you like the TV program ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", you'll love this movie. It is great that the movie is now out in DVD.",1209427200,3,1756,5.072664359861592

In a desperate race against time and nature, a geologist and a scientist must find a way to stop effects of killer outer-space rocks that are literally petrifying people with fear!

Monster on the Campus (1958, 76 min)

3354654,4,B0013XZ6SY,"This is really a solid collection of sci-fi B-movies (mostly) from the 50s.

It includes one bona-fide classic: THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, written by Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson. Though low-budget, this is a sober, literate reflection on a life made a nightmare when a man is exposed to a mysterious cloud of radiation and starts to shrink. Slowly, all the trappings of a normal life (job, respect, community, house, loved ones) fall away, and our hero must learn to survive in the strange alien world that is his basement floor...while fleeing the clutches of a rather nasty spider. It's worth the price of admission alone.

Falling into the 'Cheezy Fun' category are films like DR. CYCLOPS, THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE LAND UNKNOWN and THE MONOLITH MONSTERS. DR. CYCLOPS is the one film from the 40s in the collection, and the only one in colour. The special effects are quite good for its time, and I very much enjoyed Albert Dekker's portrayal of the titular mad scientist. THE MOLE PEOPLE and THE LAND UNKNOWN both feature adventurers falling into 'lost' worlds. THE MOLE PEOPLE is interesting for the fact that the 'monsters' are actually the good guys, and THE LAND UNKNOWN, with its rubber dinosaurs and atmospheric sets, goes down great with some soda and popcorn. THE MONOLITH MONSTERS is another 'monster from outer space' tale, but with the twist that the 'monsters' are actually...rocks. What seems like a joke is actually sold rather well (they may be slow, but they are unstoppable!) and it's a good way to spend 80 minutes of your time.

MONSTER ON CAMPUS, THE DEADLY MANTIS, TARANTULA, THE LEECH WOMAN and CULT OF THE COBRA are...ok. I hope you like stock footage though, as THE DEADLY MANTIS has a whole lot of it. Fun for people who like this sort of thing, but I wouldn't recommend the set for them. They are nice bonuses to the aforementioned films, though.",1466899200,,1884,4.808641975308642
3354655,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I,too, had bought both sets when they were being sold only at Best Buy as they were only exclusive to that store. However, I will say that all these films, although be it that it may, are campy sci-fi greats of the '50's and 1 film out of 1940,. The special efects and or make-up in every one of these films is exceptional. My least favourite of the batch is Land of The Unknown. It is a rather boring flick if you ask me although I still do think it has sci-fi class if you know what I mean?. What I think I am driving at is that this film used ""TOYS"" for the dinosaurs with hardly any movement at all. But, the story is interesting in it's own weird way. With that being said, this set of parts one and two are very well worth the time and money. Practically all these movies will keep you on the edge of your seat.

On a personal note, my wife had a memory of a movie where some kind of rock creature grew out of someone's sink that scared her when she was a little girl. She never knew if it was a dream, an episode of Outer Limits, or a movie. After 27 years of marriage I was watching a movie in this set called ""The Monolith Monsters"" when she came downstairs. It was right at that point in the movie when the rock monster was growing out of the sink! She couldn't believe it! FINALLY she knew what it was!

3354698,5,B0013XZ6SY,"This is a great collection of 10 very good 'B' Sci-Fi flicks!

So far I've watched the first five -

Tarantula - released 1955 - I had never seen this before - pretty good story with above average acting - some of the special effects were only ok but then this was more than 60 years ago plus they didn't have a ton of money to spend - very good picture and sound.

The Mole People - released 1956- very good story and acting - the first 2 star the King of the B Movies - John Agar (who was married to Shirley Temple for a short while) - John had a very interesting career as at one time it looked like he might be a fairly big star but it just didn't happen - the make-up used shows the lack of funds but otherwise a fun movie - once again very good picture and movie.

The Incredible Shrinking Man - released 1957 - This might the most famous of the first five - good idea fairly well done - pretty good special effects considering the amount of money available and when it was made. The last 30 minutes are really suspenseful as he shrinks down to nothing (starting with family cat attack then a spider, etc) - a little sad that his wife thinks he's dead when he isn't but then all movies can't end happy - can they? I just wish they had shown the entire Orsen Wells trailer instead of the greatly shortened one.

The Monolith Monsters - released 1957 - this is VERY unique idea and movie - very good picture and sound - very good writing and script - with a little more investment and a little longer run time this could have broken into A movie territory. This is far above average Sci-Fi movie that's just short of a classic! I really like this one!

Monster on the Campus - released 1958 - the title suggests drive-in trash BUT the story is a very nice take on Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde with a little of The Creature From the Black Lagoon thrown in for good measure - it sounds like a mess but it really isn't! The picture and sound, once again, are very good.

Nothing additional included other than the trailers which is kind of a shame!

I will add to this review once I've watched the 2nd set of 5 movies but so far I would rate this a very solid 8.0 to 8.5 out of 10 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR 1950'S SCI-FI FANS!!!

******************************************************************

######## ADDED 2/10/15 - I watched Dr Cyclops last night as my wife had a meeting at the church once again.

I'm still not real clear on the Dr Cyclops name except toward the end when all of his glasses were hidden or destroyed except for one with the left lens. I felt the name of the movie was very misleading and had NOTHING to do with the story. And since this was a Paramount movie (as many others have pointed out) plus it was in color (which was nice) PLUS it was made way before most of the others (made in 1939 and released in 1940). I'm not sure why it was included in this collection. It was a misfit due to the all of the above plus the storyline didn't really fit either. I didn't really care for this one.

Once again much of the so-called science behind all of the story was poorly explained (at best). Now I admit that mankind was just starting to really experiment with radation (and I yes I know about Marie Curie's work in the late 1800's & Wilhelm Roentgen's work with X-rays during the middle of the 1890's - but much work wasn't done until the 1920's and 30's) in general so that explains part of it. But I never understood WHY the other scientists were even invited or what the 'mad scientist' was even trying to do other than reduce carbon-based life forms in size. Why was he doing that - what was his endgame plans? Nothing seemed to make much sense to me.

The special effects were VERY good especially for 1939 - they would be fairly good even today! Acting ranged from ok to pretty good. Picture was very good and maybe even a little better than that. Sound was very good as well. Plot, on the other hand was a mess and made little sense. And the ending was - well the movie just ended like they ran out of film - or money - or maybe even lost interest - or didn't know how to end it. There were lots of loose ends just left dangling in the breeze. And the Love affair - why was that even in the movie?

This movie rated a ok 5.0 to 6.0 - GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS but that was about all.

***********************************************************************************

Added Tue 1/17 - watched the Deadly Mantis -(released 1957) last night (Mon 1/26/15) - picture still pretty good but there were a few verticle lines and white spots - Story not bad but it took too long to get going - almost felt like a documentary at first - characters were more 'flat' - not as detailed as the ones in the first five - still an interesting film and I'm glad I watched it - sound was very good - had William Hopper from Perry Mason fame as the male lead. This one is a step down in MHO from the 1st five movies.

I would rate this a pretty good 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10 stars - pretty good overall!

**************************************************************************************
ADDED 2/3/15 - Last night my wife had a another meeting so I watched the ""Leech Woman' (released 1960). This was yet another spin on the Stevenson story - Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. However this one was a bit of a mess and needed a rewrite to make certain things clear. I'm not exactly sure what the story was to be about other than a woman obsessed with being young again. It had a segment in Africa that was just strange and could have been handled differently - like maybe a flashback - that would have made things a little 'cleaner' and still advanced the storyline. The pineal gland stuff was utter nonsense. It's only important function in most living things is to produce melatoin which is a seratonin analog. Other than a 'possible' connection to sexual development it has no known connection to aging. And there are a few animals (like a alligator) that don't even have a pineal gland or even a collection of cells that resemble such a gland. It is this kind of stuff that drive me nuts - as a pharmacist I expect major story points to at least make some sense

OK - now that you have much more information about a gland most people have never even heard of we will move on.

Picture and sound were very good. Story not so much but still interesting - would rate this a good for a B movie 6.0 to 6.5 out of 10 - well worth watching at least once. In more capable hands this could have been a very interesting movie well worth watching more than once instead of something lessor that just misses the mark.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************
On Monday my wife had yet another meeting at the church so I watched the 'The Land Unknown'. It was fairly good but, as several other movies in the set, was fairly slow moving. But overall the movie was pretty good and the special effects were surprisingly good - expecially for such a old B movie.

I would rate this mildly surprisingly film a fairly good movie - 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10 - recommended!",1422144000,10,7160,4.433028919330289

3354751,4,B0013XZ6SY,"This is packaged like many of those ""50 Sci-Fi Movies In One Box!"" sets (usually all public domain titles), however, this is really a solid collection of Universal Studios mid to low budget sci-fi films from the fifties. Most of these have been released on either VHS or Laserdisc, but never bundled together on DVD.

And I have to say, the DVD transfers are great--these films have never looked so clear & crisp. The Deadly Mantis, The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Mole People, etc.--I saw them all on tv as a kid, but usually on old scratched prints with muddy sound. Seeing pristine prints, just like the day they opened in the theater, really changes the quality of the viewing experience.

Speaking of quality, they all feature performances from solid Universal players like Nestor Paiva & Les Tremayne and excellent special effects photography (when the budget allows) from cinematographer Clifford Stine--who worked on virtually every one these films. Producer Jack Arnold always tries to keep the stories logical enough to suspend your disbelief and in this collection it's hit & miss, but overall very enjoyable stuff.

You won't find most of these movies released separately, but if you're like me, (I was looking for a DVD of The Monolith Monsters) you're bound to have more than one you want to see--and this is really the only way to get them.",1403481600,10,1357,4.891304347826087

3354754,4,B0013XZ6SY,"1. Ultimate? A nice little set to be sure, but far from ultimate.
2. 4 discs with 2 films and 2 discs with 1 film each. Give me 2 more movies and I might overlook the ""ultimate"" thing.
3. I would also have enjoyed screaming lady faces on all the discs as well.

Those things aside; the films were diverse yet well matched. Big bugs and little people. Lands lost and found. People turning into creatures and rocks turning into bigger rocks, John Agar, Faith Domergue, Mara Corday, and Gloria Talbott. Jack Arnold. These were the friends people like me grew up with and still love today.

The quality was, well, it was the best I'd ever seen these films. I plan to enjoy these films often and with as many friends as are willing to watch with me.",1402790400,,744,4.345323741007194
3354755,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I was not old enough to have seen these movies in the theater. I grew up through the 60s watching a local Saturday afternoon TV show called Monster Movie Matinee, especially in Winter. Don't get me wrong, I loved being out in the snow, but by 1PM I'd had enough and in I'd come to curl up on the couch. Just as I like my mono 45rpm's, I still love black and white movies. The print for each of these is fantastic. What made the whole set even more enjoyable was only vaguely recalling half. Despite reports, TV wasn't always Frankenstein, Dracula or the Mummy. NOTE: Though there are mostly two movies per disk, these are not the cheaper two-sided disks and the packaging was of sufficient quality. I'm glad I purchased the combined volumes 1 & 2.
There are enough other, more detailed reviews. I'm adding mine for one reason and it's the most intriguing thing I found about this set. In 2011 I discovered a cable show called Face Off (unfortunately not available for purchase). This is a reality show that has fantasy makeup artists compete. Let me say here I like sci-fi, but I know very little technically, so I would not normally be interested in this type show. It is hosted by McKenzie Westmore. This season (2014) her father, Michael, has taken on a larger role of advisor. He is so knowledgeable I wish he were in the whole show. Okay, here's where my stupidity surfaces. I had never heard of the famous Westmore family of makeup artists and sort of wondered who this guy was.
So now to the point. I buy this movie set, mostly for Tarantula and Dr. Cyclops and I find six other true gems (and two watchable but lower budget ones), and I spot the make-up credit on the first, then the second, all the way through the tenth. They are all Bud Westmore, Michael's uncle. (Thanks Wikipedia) He also did Creature From the Black Lagoon. I would never call these B Movies and Bud is no slouch. Check out the increasingly gruesome makeup during Tarantula. Each is interesting and beautifully filmed and edited. No one gets slashed. Nothing blows up. Nobody visits Hell. Sorry kids. It makes me wonder why I bother with 300 cable channels of the same rehashed garbage.
So, whether you grew up on monster movies or are a fan of modern sci-fi looking for a bit of history, I am completely satisfied I now own these. Could you hit the lights on the way out?",1398556800,2,2352,4.484848484848484
3354756,4,B0013XZ6SY,"Actually, The Deadly Mantis is also good. And The Incredible Shrinking Man is also very well done as is The cult of the Cobra, which has a lot of suspense. But the Mole People, the Monolith Monsters and the Land Unknown to me are awful and I will probably never which them again. Of course that leaves Dr Cyclops, which was made in 1940 way before any of the rest of these films and the only one in color. And has for its time just as good special affects as Shrinking Man. But it does not fit at all as it was made many years before any of the other films and so it simply doesn""t belong here. Although it is well made and enjoyable. That leaves my favorites-led by Monster on the Campus with Arthur Franz. I saw this as a teenager in 1958 and it scared me a lot. Still love it! Next comes Tarantula which to me was the best of the bug movies after the great Them from 1954. Was great fun watching it again. Last but not least is the Leech Woman, which stars the beautiful Coleen Gray,who needs to kill to look young. Besides starring in several film noirs of the late 1940s and early 1950s she starred with John Beal in a very scary film called  the Vampire from 1957.

Mole People literally leaves you with a taste for dirt in your mouth. Incredible Shrinking Man was disturbing..he should have eaten much better. Monolith Monsters (my fave) the monster killers are skyscraper sized rocks, I mean cmon!!! Monster on Campus was hilarious! Leech Woman sucked. Deadly Mantis was cool, nothing like watching cars being crushed in the big old loving arms of a bug.  Land Unknown had dinosaurs aplenty!

When I saw that not only is Leech Woman available in dvd now, its in a collection with some of my other favorites, especially the Incredible Shrinking Man!  I ordered it immediately.  One reviewer complained about not some of the dvds being defective.  I had a similar problem with other new dvds but a guy at Best  Buys geek squad told me to get a dvd cleaner disk.  Sometimes even new dvds have dust on them.  I did that and the ""defective"" dvds play now with no problem.

I have a few complaints about this collection: first only Tarantula, Incredible Shrinking Man, Dr. Cyclops and the Leech Woman came anywhere close to science fiction. When I think science fiction I think flying saucers, outer space, laser guns. Most of the movies are just B movie monsters. Also the only extra you get are the trailers for each movie; no coming attractions or film commentary. This collection fell way below my expectation of science fiction movies. The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, Volumes 1 & 2 gets a B- for misleading the public.

VOLUME 1
6 hour 31 minutes

Disc 1

Tarantula! Is one hour and twenty - one minutes and was released in theaters on December 14, 1955. Professor Gerald Deemer and his two associates are working on a formula to prevent world hunger but the when they tests the formula on animals it make them grow several times their size. One day when the professor is out, his two associates try the formula on them selves and develop runaway acromegaly. Both of them die within four days after injecting themselves, however one of them goes mad and wreck the lab and injects Professor Gerald Deemer with the formula while he is unconscious. Unknown to Professor Deemer a giant tarantula escapes and wreck havoc on the town. It is up to the local and state police to stop this spider.

The Mole People is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theaters in December of 1956. A group of archaeologists are on a dig when they discover a stone tablet and buy an old oil lamp with some ancient writings. They decide to climb the mountain to find more artifacts and when they get to the top one of the archaeologists fall through a hole. Of the five men that went down the hole, including the one who fell, three live and find the lost city of the Sumerian people. The three are capture are and to be sentence to die. They escape death and try to find a way out of there. Besides rescuing some mole people from being tortured that is the gist of the movie. A footnote or two about this movie: one you might recognize Alan Napier as the Elinu, the High Priest. He went on to play Alfred in the sixties television show Batman. Second get a good look at Dr. Jud Bellamin; that is Hugh Beaumont who played Ward Cleaver in Leave It To Beaver.

Disc 2

The Incredible Shrinking Man is one hour and twenty - one minutes and was released on February 22, 1957. The main story is Scott and Carey Williams are on vacation on a boat cruise somewhere off the coast of California.

Six months later he notices he is getting smaller the doctor that he first saw sends him to the California Medical Research Institute for three weeks of tests. The come up with an antidote that they think will prevent him from getting smaller. It works for a little while until he starts to get smaller again. The special effects in this movie are great for its day. The only thing is I wished it had a better ending.

The Monolith Monsters is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theaters in December 1957. The movie takes place in a town call San Angelo, California. Over a billion years ago a meteorite has landed on Earth and in present day is growing. The meteor rocks fossilize anybody that mixes it with water. The town has just had a rain storm and the rocks are growing at an enormous rate. It is up to the town geologist and a doctor to come up with a solution or watch their town gets destroyed. The amazing thing about this movie there are really no monsters in this movie.

Disc 2

The Land Unknown is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters in August of 1957. The movie is about and expedition over Antarctica where there is an unusual warm body of water. They are called back to the ship due to a storm coming. They are running low on gas and try to go through the storm. The helicopter is hit by a pterodactyl and the helicopter start to descend below sea level. The crew lands in a volcanic crater somewhere in the dinosaur age. There they struggle to survive and fix the helicopter.

The Deadly Mantis is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in May of 1957. Basically somewhere in the South Seas there is a volcanic explosion and the effects are felt all the way to the North Pole. This effect melts the ice around a million or two year old mantis. The mantis goes on an eating spree; I guess I would be hungry if I did not have a bite for over a million years. It finally makes it way to the United States like all B Movie monsters do. The only time we actually see the whole mantis move at once is when we watch scale the Washington Monument. Sort of remind you when King Kong climbs the Empire State Building.

Disc 3

The Leech Woman is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released in theatres in May of 1960. An old woman comes into Dr. Paul Talbot's office and claims she is 140 years old and tells him the secret of her only if he pays for her trip back to Africa. Dr. Talbot witnesses the transformation and takes his not so beautiful with him to Africa so she can be a test subject. When the guide, Dr. Talbot and Mrs. Talbot are capture and brought to the village where orchid pollen is grown they meet old Malla and three later witnesses the ceremony where old Malla becomes a young woman. Malla tell the three that they can have everything they want except their freedom. Dr. Talbot asks that Malla makes his wife young again and June finds out the real reason at last why she was brought to Africa and she chooses her husband as the person to be sacrifice for his pineal gland secretions. June is made young and she and the guide escape from the village. The rest of the movie June kills men to keep her young until she is caught.",1365638400,4,7953,4.347708894878706

3354794,3,B0013XZ6SY,"I've seen nearly every classic B grade sci-fi and horror movie ever made and I absolutely love the genre, but I'm being perfectly honest when I say that this collection is massively overpriced and not that great except for one movie, The Incredible Shrinking Man. Depending on how dedicated you are to the genre, it might be worth it to you to buy these, but there are much better campy classics out there than what you will find in this collection. The best movie in the collection is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" which really is a masterpiece of the time period, but most of the other selections are average or worse. ""Monolith Monsters"" and ""Tarantula"" are certainly watchable, but depending on how entertained you are by fairly boring low budget thrillers will determine whether you will want to watch the rest. I would skip ""The Land Unknown"", ""Cult of the Cobra"", and ""The Mole People"" altogether.

For the most part these movies are not top sci-fi selections of the 1940s-60s and really not classics in any sense, except for The Incredible Shrinking Man and maybe Tarantula, but the rest aren't even really recognized cult favorites. Quite honestly you will get more campy cheesiness out of the 50 Movie Horror Packs which include such genuine cult classics as The Night of the Living Dead, The Brain that Wouldn't Die, The Last Man on Earth, Maniac, the original Little Shop of Horrors and The House on Haunted Hill (the old 2005 packs also include Robot Monster and Wasp Woman which are both awful but entertaining cheese). So don't feel like you are missing anything really great if you pass on this collection. I would try to either rent or stream The Incredible Shrinking Man.",1363046400,4,1690,4.787671232876712

3354813,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I don't even know where to begin with this truly classic collection.  Featuring nine Universal films from the 1950s (plus one out of place Paramount film from 1940), included on the set are some of my favorite 50s Sci-Fi/Horror films.

Tarantula (1955, 5 stars) follows a small town doctor, his atomic research scientist girlfriend, and a giant tarantula.  Surpassed only by AIP's Earth vs. the Spider in the giant arachnid genre, the film features a brief early cameo by Clint Eastwood.

Even more impressive is The Deadly Mantis (1957, 5 stars), which along with Warner Brothers' Them, is one of my two favorite giant insect films of all time.  The Deadly Mantis features a giant prehistoric relative of the common praying mantis going up against the US military and a paleontologist.

Neither Tarantula nor The Deadly Mantis is the traditional Atomic Age monster fare, though both feature giant monsters neither was the result of an atomic weapon.  In fact, the only film in the collection to feature an atomic ""menace"" is The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957, 4 stars), directed by Jack Arnold from Richard Matheson's book The Shrinking Man, in which a radioactive mist causes a businessman to slowly shrink into nothingness.

Other noteworthy offerings on the collection include The Mole People (1956, 3 stars) a sci-fi jaunt about an underground civilization; The Land That Time Forgot rip-off The Land Unknown (1957, 3 stars); The Monolith Monsters (1957, 4 stars), about rocks that grow when in contact with water.

While not the worst film on the collection, that honor goes to Jack Arnold's Monster on the Campus (1958, 2 stars, but kinda fun), Paramount's Dr. Cyclops (1940, 3 stars) is the sets true letdown.  It simply feels wrong for the collection.  Despite being the oldest film on the set (fifteen years older than the next oldest), it is the only color entry.  It also falls short of the usual level of fun expected from Universal's films.  Its spot would have be better filled by something from Universal's own cannon, 1955's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Island-Earth/dp/B000FVQLKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Island Earth</a>&nbsp;perhaps.

Rounding out the collection are two weaker entries Cult of the Cobra (1955, 3 stars) and The Leech Woman (1959, 3 stars).

Noteworthy actors to appear on this collection include Eastwood, Richard Long, Jack Kelly (Bart Maverick), scream queen Gloria Talbott, Troy Donahue, Grant Williams, Hugh Beaumont (Leave it to Beaver's Ward Cleaver), Faith Domergue, David Janssen, John Agar, Universal regular Nestor Paiva, Leo G. Carroll, Paul L. Smith, and Alan Napier (Alfred from Batman).  Also, Orson Wells narrates the trailer for The Incredible Shrinking Man but does not appear in the film.

The set is light on special features, containing trailers for all 10 films but nothing else.  Perhaps the Universal Legacy collection was just spoiled me, but I would have loved to see a documentary or two and commentaries on at least the bigger films (Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula, Deadly Mantis).

3354832,5,B0013XZ6SY,"I will review the 2 films in Vol. 1

Some of the reviews have called these films ""campy."" They were nothing of the sort. If they were ""campy"" then, then I suggest that Star Wars, Star Trek and some of our contemporary sci-fi movies are campy as well.

The problem with innovative techniques in either films or technology is that, whereas they are initially hailed as revolutionary and ingenious, after a few decades of improvements, they are seen as boring and contemptible by people (look at the Wright Brothers' plane, the Mercury capsule, the telephone, the model T-ford) and become unappreciated for what they were and what they achieved. This goes especially so in movies. With today's technology, the modern version of King Kong makes the old, original, one laughable to dullards. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was a superbly made sci-fi movie about a man on a private boat that comes into contact with a mysterious cloud over the ocean. In the weeks to come he begins to shrink smaller and smaller and begins to live in a child's doll house, until ultimately, towards the end of the movie, he is the size of an insect. The movie's emphasis is on his, and his wife's, coping with the condition. At the end, he becomes aware that size is relative and while he is tiny by human standards, by other standards, he is gigantic. The film ends optimistically and one gets the impression that he will set out on new adventures into the molecular level.

The other film, badly titled ""The Monolith Monsters,"" is a cerebral sci-fi with almost no special effects, so that some viewers will find it boring. The plot is simple, yet chilling: a meteor crashes into the desert, exploding into pieces. They are picked up by the curious and when the pieces come into contact with water, they expand exponentially. In doing so they absorb the water content of any living organism that they come into contact with. The protagonists attempt to solve the mystery but as rare rain showers approach, catastrophe is imminent.

Both films' plots and characterization were very good.",1308096000,9,2064,4.805633802816901
3354833,1,B0013XZ6SY,"hi all, I have been waiting for ""The Mole People"" to come out on dvd for a long time. I had it on vid, but gave away the player. I don't have much money now, so I am dissapointed that it's only offerred in this large, and largely worthless, collection. The Mole People is not typical ""campy"" 50's sci fi. It's interesting and intelligent, with wonderful and creative script, sets, costumes, make-up, acting, and even, like the narrator says at the begining, a message for all of us. I think some talented, blacklisted people found themselves working on this low-budget, B-movie type project and put their best into it regardless. So if you have money to throw away on the rest of the silly trash in the collection, by all means buy it for this one gem.",1307491200,6,752,4.4963503649635035
3354834,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I am amazed the Incredible Shrinking Man is not available by itself - rather than packaged with a buinch of lessser Sci Fi grindhouse movies from the 1950s.

It and ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are the supreme trilogy of 1950s Sci Fi. In 2009, it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant and will be preserved for all time.

The Incredible Shrinking Man towers above any remakes or take offs for two main reasons. The most convincing special effects possible (most everything was real physical objects - no digital - from a huge mouse trap to a match box big enough to live in) and story you may NEVER forget.

It is way more than a story of a ""shrinking man"". It is the story of a man who discovers a truth we all seek. An indefinable truth - the one way down in your heart - deep inside....

He discovers it through heartbreak, losing all those he loves and cares about, suffering incredible indignity and physical pain, even having his beloved pet turn on him and see him as nothing as a piece of meat.

But through survival - he discovers something very amazing... A common thread in all creatures and huimanity.

In the end our shrinking man is as large as anyone can possibly be. A true ""expanding man"".

In my opinion Grant Willams performance is Oscar worthy. He really knocks it out of the park and leaves you absolutely convinced that all this is really happening to him

Getting smaller:
""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" - The title says it all.  Its sets and props are completely believable.
""Dr. Cyclops"" -  Obsessively secretive about his work, the optically-challenged inventor relishes shrinking prying snoops.

Getting larger:
""Tarantula"" - This gargantuan spider looks better than the big ants in ""Them"" or the huge locust in ""Beginning of the End"".
""The Monolith Monsters"" - Dark, glossy, shards of a meteorite grow and multiply, threatening to crush a desert town.

Prehistoric creatures:
""The Deadly Mantis"" - A gigantic praying mantis, trapped in a glacier, thaws out.  Luckily, there is only one; it eats humans.
""Monster on the Campus"" - The water from a thawing extinct fish, if touched, causes regression to a primeval form.
""The Land Unknown"" - Polar dinosaurs!  The swimming dinosaur looks the fiercest.  The lethargic T-rex looks the silliest.

Hidden societies:
""The Mole People"" - An ancient society, deep in the Earth, survives under austere conditions.
""Cult of the Cobra"" - A secret society worships a charming young woman who can morph into a deadly hooded snake.
""The Leech Woman"" - A jungle tribe can rejuvenate a woman, but unfortunately, in order to do it, a man must die.

Overall: These movies fall in the 3 to 5 rating range.  The most fun to watch is ""The Monolith Monsters"" and the most polished film is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"".",1285718400,,1524,5.163265306122449

Credit should be given to Universal Studios for putting out collections like this. The quality of the prints are first rate. I remember when it first came out on laser disc years ago and have regretted not buying it then. When I saw this on Amazon I knew I had to make up for that past mistake. My favorites in this collection are Cult Of The Cobra and The Land Unknown. The only movie that didn't age well, in my opinion, was The incredible Shrinking Man, which is disappointing since it was one of my faves as a kid. I don't know why but it didn't seem to age well, and even then was only mildly disappointing. Do yourself a favor: BUY THIS COLLECTION!

This is fun to watch late at night with a storm brewing outside. I also like ""The Mole People"" for the story & watching Hugh Beaumont in something besides ""Leave it to Beaver"". It's corny, but I like John Agar in this film & the creepy atmosphere. All these films very in quality of story, but when I saw them they left quite a few nice impressions on me.

3354880,5,B0013XZ6SY,"Volumes one and Two of the Universal Science Fiction sets, that were once available for a limited time at Best Buy retailers are now avialable in one wonderful set for a decent price. Many of the films featured on here are Monster movie favorites ranging from Classic to mediocre, but not really a less than entertaining one in the bunch.

The films include:
Tarantula(1955)-Clearly an imitation of the superior, ""Them!(1954)"", this film is the best of it's rip-offs featuring a good cast led by Sci-Fi stalwart, John Agar and the ultra hot, Mara Corday. The effects are quite good in this one and the subplot involving the experiments of the doctor who made the Tarantula is actually interesting. It's also fun to see Clint Eastwood as the Fighter Pilot who drops napalm on the Tarantula at the end! A good effort from Universal.

The Mole People(1957)-Mediocre effort with interesting plot, involves a few archaeologists who get stranded underground and discover a lost civilization of albinos(!) who have enslaved a race of mole people(!) and there growing rebellion. The Mole people are pretty cool looking but the film is burdened by a lack of action and a out of place, downbeat ending.

The Incredible Shrinking Man(1957)-The best film on the set and one of the best Science Fiction films ever made. Grant Williams is excellent as a man exposed to a strange radiation that causes him to shrink mysteriously. A thought provoking script by the great, Richard Matheson and surefire direction by Sci-Fi favorite, Jack Arnold combine to make this an all-time classic. Great effects, too!

The Monolith Monsters(1957)-The award for weirdest Monster concept goes to this moody thriller about mysterious rocks from space that have a life of there own, taking in the body fluids of people and turning them to stone. They also grow giant if exposed to water. Ooh-Oh. Surprisngly tense and well acted, this one is the sleeper of the set.

Monster on the Campus(1958)-Preposterous film has Doctor Arthur Franz recieve a Cyleocanth and finding that exposure to it's blood causes one to revert to a primordial state! So this includes a German Shepherd becoming a ""wolf""(he's just wearing fangs, kids) a giant dragonfly and Franz turning into a ape man!(the same make-up that make-up artist recycled WAY too many times from Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde(1952). Well directed and Franz is sympathetic, but strictly average.

Dr. Cyclops(1940)-Bizarre film that is totally out of place on this set. It's the only Color film. It's the only film not made by Universal(it's made by Paramount) and it's made in 1940! Why is it on here? Who knows. However, it IS an actual Science Fiction film as opposed to a Monster film and is actually pretty good. Albert Dekker makes a memorable mad scientist, experimenting with ways of shrinking people and animals. Great effects from the director of the original King Kong(1933). It's not a classic , but very entertaining little adventure film nonetheless.

Cult of the Cobra(1955)-Noir influences abound on this sleeper about American GIs who witness a strange ritual where beautiful women become cobras(!). The soldiers break up the cult and escape, only to have one of the lethal babes on there trail, picking them off one by one. Faith Domergue is gorgeous as the exotic femme fatale, but is not a great actress. Marshall Thompson, a vet of Sci-Fi classics, fares better. The romance between the two adds a level of tragedy to the film that keeps this Monster flick above average.

The Land Unknown(1955)-Universal makes there own ""lost World: adventure flick with this entertaining little feature about a helicopter crew that crash land in an arctic jungle land, where dinosaurs lurk! The effects are fun and the acting is adequate(Though leading lady Shawn Smith should have STAYED a brunette. She was way younger looking in It, The Terror From Beyond Space(1958). The film never seems to gain any momentum, though and when compared to the best of it's type, remains just mediocre. The sets are cool, though and it looks nice in widescreen. Enjoyable, but no classic.

The Deadly Mantis(1957)-Very fun Monster Movie about a GIANT prehistoric Mantis unleashed from the ice in the Arctic attacking an army base and than Washington! The effects are first rate and some scenes are genuinely chilling(that scene with the Mantis appearing out of the fog, swallowing a bus on a road is right out of a nightmare) and the climax is a good one. The romantic sub-plot between Craig Stevens and Alix Talton is actually funny and enjoyable, rather than distracting. This is one of the more underrated Monster movies of the period.

The Leech Woman(1960)-Sort-of hilarious satire(in a way) on female vanity has Colleen Grey afraid of losing her looks, so she goes on a sfari to obtain a magic powder to make herself beautiful once more. However, it's only temporary and she needs blood to stay young! The actress is quite good in this, but the film never quite rises above it's material with the amount of drama and wit that could have made this a minor classic. In otherwords, it's just okay.

This is one fun set of Monster Movies and is reccomended to both B-Movie hecklers and serious genre fans, since there is a nice mixture of the two and both parties will have many pleasant surprises. Some may appear corny, others may feel dated, but the entertainment value has not diminshed from these classics one bit.

3354883,5,B0013XZ6SY,"In the early days of talkie films, many of the major studios carved out their own niches:  MGM did the spectacular movies and the musicals, Warner Brothers did the social issue and gangster movies and Universal did the monster movies.  By the 1950s, Frankenstein and company were generally played out, so Universal switched from the supernatural to the ""scientific"" monsters.  These films were for the most part B-movie fare and generally fun, but also formulaic enough to merit parody, most notably on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  In fact, at least three of the ten movies in The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection were redone on MST3K.

These ten movies fit into four categories, each with two or three films:  the big, the small, the lost and the shifty.  The ""big"" films deal with oversized monsters:  Tarantula, The Monolith Monsters and The Deadly Mantis.  Tarantula, one of three in the set directed by Jack Arnold (of Creature of the Black Lagoon fame) deals with an oversized arachnid that terrorizes a small town.  Guns can't stop it, dynamite can't stop it:  is the world doomed?  B movie stalwart John Agar leads the cast, while Clint Eastwood appears briefly in one of his earliest roles (His first role?  A cameo in Revenge of the Creature (not part of this set)).  The Deadly Mantis (parodied on MST3K) features a thawed out giant insect that heads south from the Arctic.  The Monolith Monster feature the monster that is simultaneously the most interesting and the most boring:  giant rocks that tear up the landscape and multiply when wet.

The ""small"" films are the closest to classics in the bunch.  Dr. Cyclops is unique in this set for three reasons:  it is not only the only one not made by Universal (but by Paramount instead), it is the only one not made in the 1950s (it was made in 1940) and it is the only one in color.  The story focuses on the title character, a mad scientist who creates a device that can shrink animals, including some people who get too close to his secrets.  The Incredible Shrinking Man has the title character facing doom as he gets smaller and smaller, ultimately winding up in mortal battle with a spider.

The ""lost"" films deal with lost worlds.  The Mole People (another MST3K victim) has archaeologists (including future Ward Beaver Hugh Beaumont) finding an ancient Sumerian civilization living underground.  They are distrusful of outsiders, but are so sensitive to light that a flashlight is blinding and sunlight can kill.  The Land Unknown has a group of people finding a lost world in Antarctica, complete with dinosaurs and carnivorous plants.

The ""shifty"" movies deal with people transforming into beasts.  In Monster on the Campus, the main character changes into a primitive savage after being ""bitten"" by the fossil of an ancient fish.  In Cult of the Cobra (the one really supernatural movie in the bunch), some ex-soldiers run afoul of the title group, which sends a woman after them, one who can transform at will into a cobra.  Finally, The Leech Woman has a middle-aged woman who can turn young briefly, but only if she kills.  Despite being another film that MST3K spoofed, it does stand out in one respect:  it stars B-movie beauty Coleen Gray.  While the actresses in the other films are little more than eye candy who scream at appropriate times, Gray is exceptional in her more human character.  It is little wonder that Gray is the only actress in the set to have a decent career (including films like Kiss of Death, Nightmare Alley, Kansas City Confidential and The Killing).

It'd be a little much to say these are great movies, but they are all fun to watch.  The low-budget effects, the cheesy writing (except for the Richard Matheson penned Incredible Shrinking Man) and the often wooden acting do not hurt these films but somehow enhance them.  There aren't many extras (only movie trailers), but this is still a nice set, and with no movie topping 81 minutes, these films are quick and entertaining.",1230336000,61,3988,4.82179675994109

Though the inclusion of ""Cult Of The Cobra"" is a puzzle (it's really a supernatural horror story), by in large, a majority of the films are quite enjoyable and the print quality is excellent on all of them.

Personal favs in the collection are ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""The Monolith Monsters"", ""Tarantula"" (keep an eye open for a VERY young Clint Eastwood as an Air Force pilot), ""Monster On Campus"" & ""The Deadly Mantis"".

""Dr. Cyclops"" is the oldest of the set being released in 1940. Though the effects are somewhat dated, the plot holds your interest unlike the abysmal ""Leech Woman"". I've always wondered why collections such as these are seemingly required to include a 'dog' like ""The Leech Woman"" though I suppose on one level it helps one to appreciate the others.

This collection is highly recommended and I'm looking forward to seeing what The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection Volumes 3 & 4 look like.",1228176000,3,1081,4.73936170212766

""...Shrinking Man"" is perhaps my top favorite for the questions it raises about mankind and his quest for self-destruction, nuclear energy's negative side, and the beauty of profound philosophical thought as well as our smallness in the universe.  It has stayed with me always and I thank Richard Matheson, daily, for his gift - his many gifts to me(us) .  The others all caused thought to engage, actively.  What a wonderful package this is!

Transfer quality is great. Trailers for these movies are included. That's it. No commentary, no documentaries, no rare features. Still, the picture quality and the price is worth it.

Small trivia to look out for. The script for ""The Land Unknown"" was scripted by radio script writer William N. Robson trying his hand at a screenplay. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was scripted by Richard Matheson, from his novel of the same name -- the same man responsible for ""The Omega Man / The Last Man on Earth."" The airforce pilot who saves the day in ""Tarantula"" remains hidden in the suit and helmet but take my word for it -- that's Clint Eastwood!

3354922,4,B0013XZ6SY,"I wanted to write a review on the movie ""Monolith Monsters"" but this was the only place I coud find it.  Upon seeing the titles here, it reminded me of the local Twin Cities show ""Horror Inclorporated"" which aired on Friday nights when I was a kid.  These movies are corny, poorly written and acted, not worth packaging as individual films, but kind of fun to watch.

As said, I'm particularly drawn to Monolith Monsters because I can't help but think of how it is a critique of modern urban society.  These monolithic rocks grow to skyscraper height when they come in contact with water.  Anyone who touches them turns to stone.  How similar it is to our modern culture.  We build cities out of nothing (usually based on some nearby natural resource or other reason) with buildings that reach to the sky.  The contents of those buildings is the ideas that make our society achieve, though often it can be very impersonal.  If one becomes to caught up in the machinations of our society (always striving to get ahead or needed to keep up with the Joneses) you can turn to stone (figuratively, not literally).  In time the resource disappears and the reason for the city or the culture disppears as well (think of all the world empires that are now ""ruins"").  Thus the monoliths move onto somewhere else leaving behind something for the historians or archaeologists to ponder.

Anyway, I realize this is kind of a stretch, but I can't not think of this analogy when I think of ""Monolith Monsters"" and I'm glad it has been included in this corny movie collection.",1219017600,5,1561,4.636363636363637

My only complaint is that Universal continues to omit ""The Thing That Couldn't Die"" from release (reason unknown), and while ""Curse Of The Undead"" did make it out on VHS, they haven't seen fit to release that great film on DVD either.  And then there's ""Curuccu, Beast Of The Amazon"", not a great film but still fun and still unreleased.
