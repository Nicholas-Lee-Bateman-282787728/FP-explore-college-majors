8662800,1,B00KZ3SJZA,"""Miss Lovely"" is a fictionalized account of the Bollywood exploitation industry.  It is highly recommended.  This censored DVD release is not.  In several scenes, the image is digitally fogged.  Worse, in every scene in which a character smokes a cigarette (and there are many, considering when this film takes place), an on-screen warning about the dangers of cancer appears.  These public safety messages must be mandatory in India, but I can't recommend this DVD because of them.  Let's hope that an uncensored, warning-free edition turns up because this well-made film deserves it.",1421625600,,585,5.304347826086956
8662801,4,B00KZ3SJZA,"Set in the underbelly of Mumbai's sex and horror film biz, this film follows the story of 2 brothers who make local smut in the 80s. A truly unique and terrific film, it reminds me less of Boogie Nights than a Jean Pierre Melville film or classic Noir. Full of mood, unfolding more like a documentary, the film is a dark entry into the world of asian exploitation. It moves less like a thriller and more like a novel, full of digressions and plot twists. i was not sure what to expect, but the film really blew away anything i was imagining. highly recommended for fans of unconventional cinema.",1410134400,2,595,4.467889908256881
