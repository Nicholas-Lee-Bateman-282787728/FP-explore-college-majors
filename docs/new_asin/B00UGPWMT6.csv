8705936,5,B00UGPWMT6,I just watched this movie on tv and absolutely loved it!  You will laugh out loud and cry too. There are so many hilarious moments and heartwarming moments as well. Robin Williams was amazing in this role. Plus James Earl Jones has a cameo! What more could one ask for!,1483747200,,269,4.38
