8389856,4,B0036CD41G,"It's a documentary. Documentaries are biased by nature. That said, it's a good look into the debacle that is American public schools.",1492905600,,133,5.090909090909091
8389857,5,B0036CD41G,"A chilling account of almost totalitarian control in US schools, with children being criminalised, their normal behaviour medicalised and diagnosed as deviant, driven, it seems to me, by the interests of corporate capitalism. Sadly, some of this crap has been infiltrating into my country, Britain.",1487203200,,298,5.644444444444445
8389858,5,B0036CD41G,"A tragic look at what politics, mismanagement and lack of funding have done to America's public education system. This is a great compilation piece to Waiting for Superman. Answers some horrifying questions as to what happens when the state is in charge of education.",1407801600,,267,5.090909090909091
8389859,5,B0036CD41G,I would get another they say i have to write 20 words or more i let them know it was a great item and they can read other statements to know whether they like the product enough to buy it.,1392940800,,188,3.725
8389860,4,B0036CD41G,"As a pastor, and grandparent, I have seen the devestating effects of this war.  This DVD is something parents need to see, and share with their friends, before it is too late.",1369267200,,175,4.46875
8389861,5,B0036CD41G,"If you have ever taught in a public school or volunteered in a public school this video will ring true for you.  So many ""experts"" say the same things I have been saying for years.  It's hard to watch, but important.",1368921600,3,216,4.2439024390243905
8389862,5,B0036CD41G,"This movie is a must see for anyone with kids, or even if you are a taxpayer with no kids since tax money goes to public schools. I had already decided to homeschool before watching this, but now I feel the need to share what I learned with other parents!",1363824000,2,255,4.12
8389863,5,B0036CD41G,"If you have children you should watch this. Don't let me or anyone else tell you what it is. You should watch this paying careful attention.
I found the part about the chemical lobotomies the most important information out there, remembering there was a time when the ""best"" doctors were driving ""ice picks"" behind the eye sockets and stirring up the brain. ""Ice picks"" once represented the leading edge of psychiatric science. They were the operative tools in lobotomy, also known as leucotomy, an operation which was seen as a miracle cure for a range of mental illnesses. These drugs now represent the leading edge of psychiatric science and are seen as a miracle cure for a wide range of mental illnesses. See any coincidence?
It is very important. Try to watch this video without any bias/prejudice, just listen. If you do, you will be able to look at your children, and think back to yourself as a child and even remember, do not scold/criticize your children so much that they give-up and quit trying.
They are people too, give them the same respect you would expect them to give you, and others. You are responsible for their well being.",1362441600,3,1145,4.73
8389864,1,B0036CD41G,"Although I did agree with parts of this documentary, I found it to be full of haunting images of children being mistreated, and extreme scenarios played out to look like every day. I do not watch fear based extreme conspiracy videos for a reason.",1353369600,2,246,4.613636363636363
8389865,4,B0036CD41G,"This is an important documentary.  Several of the authors interviewed (John Gatto, Henry Giroux, Alfie Kohn, Pat Farenga, etc) really make the film.  Underneath the areas examined by the film (psychiatric drugging of children, the repercussions of industrial education, teaching to the tests, conditioning kids to submit to authoritarianism, etc) lies eye-opening support for concepts like critical pedagogy, deschooling, and unschooling.  A must-see for parents and teachers alike.  Occasionally just a bit dramatic - but nonetheless a very worthwhile documentary.  The film won't disappoint.  In the same genre is 'Waiting for Superman' and 'Race to Nowhere'.  Overall 'The War on Kids' is an excellent introduction into examining why we should look hard at how we are treating our children.",1320192000,7,793,5.61344537815126
