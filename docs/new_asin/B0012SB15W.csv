The events in Berlin surrounding the wall seem to get all the press, but there was also a very long, fortified border running between East and West Germany. This documentary visits a number of the remaining artifacts of the border and does a good job of telling stories about the conditions and procedures along the way. The only two potentially negative aspects of the film are that 1) It has depressing music that keeps repeating and 2) The German is fairly difficult for beginning students. However, if you are interested in this period or German history, this is a good documentary.",1240444800,2,715,4.682539682539683
8247625,5,B0012SB15W,"Finial someone is telling the untold story. This DVD is a great documentary on the former East - West German border. I found this DVD both informative and interesting. Maybe this is because I spent 30 months in Bad Hersfeld with the 3rd Recon Sqdn 14th Armored Cav that took part in the border patrol during the Cold War. The DVD is of high quality, well worth the price. I have put a link about this DVD on my web page free of charges to the company ...... [...]",1213833600,5,463,4.213483146067416

8247627,5,B0012SB15W,"This DVD is fantastic! I am a MS & HS German teacher and found this DVD both informative and interesting. It offers the content in both English & German and offers subtitles in both languages as well, making it an excellent resource for any level of learner. The image quality, sound track, and information about the Inner-German Border are all of high quality. This DVD is more than worth the price (especially considering the difficulty of finding ANY region 1 DVDs that can still play German language...not to mention having to pay a small fortune for them!) I highly recommend not only this DVD, but also their other DVD (""Stasi""), and I would confidently buy any other product from this company.",1210896000,6,700,4.793388429752066
