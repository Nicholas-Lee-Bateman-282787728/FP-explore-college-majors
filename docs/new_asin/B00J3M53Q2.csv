8647750,5,B00J3M53Q2,"CLASSIC DRAMA COLLECTION gives viewers a chance to enjoy classic costume dramas; more stars than there are in heaven, to quote the old MGM boast; great acting, lavish costumes, and spectacular locations in five televised British dramas that were also seen on public television in the United States. The collection includes Emma, Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, The Lady's Not for Burning, and The Death of the Heart.  Most of the presentations, whether based on original material by women authors, or adapted by women screenwriters, give us an intelligent feminist outlook on life.  In this box set, the five movies are on five disks totaling about 8  hours.  And with subtitles, thank goodness, and thank RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, for who would want to miss a word of these noteworthy productions, dating from the mid-1980s-90s, made by ITV, in the days when they really knew how to make  costume dramas.  In this case, with Kate Beckinsale, Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Ciarn Hinds, Kenneth Branagh, Tara Fitzgerald, and Andrew Lincoln among others.

Disc 1
Jane Austen's Emma
Emma Woodhouse, (Kate Beckinsale, UNDERWORLD), is beautiful, wealthy, thinks perhaps, a bit too well of herself--and likes to meddle in other people's lives. Her good intentions create unexpected results, especially where her own heart is concerned.  She here plays against the romantic lead Mr. Knightley, Mark Strong, (SHERLOCK HOLMES, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY), who more often plays villains.

Disc 2
Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre
Plain, proper Jane Eyre, as played by Samantha Morton (IN AMERICA), survives a troubled childhood to become governess at Thornfield Hall. But the place is haunted by secrets, which complicate Jane's growing passion for her mysterious employer, Mr. Rochester, as played by Ciaran Hinds, (GAME OF THRONES).  Of course, the conundrum of the mad woman in the attic, Mrs. Rochester, has been dismaying feminists for nearly two centuries now.

Disc 3
The Woman in White
When drawing teacher Walter Hartwright, played by Andrew Lincoln, (THE WALKING DEAD), arrives to tutor wealthy half-sisters Laura,  (Justine Waddell, TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES), and Marian Fairlie,  played by Tara Fitzgerald, (BRASSED OFF),  he's accosted by a raving madwoman in white, played by Samantha Morton. Her appearance casts a pall over Laura's engagement to Sir Percival Glyde, played by James Wilby, (MAURICE, GOSFORD PARK).  The accusations of the woman in white threaten the women's lives. Based on a mystery novel of the same name by the 19th century author Wilkie Collins, who was a friend of Charles Dickens': the Victorian-era novel was considered among the earliest British mysteries.

Disc 4
The Lady's Not for Burning
Kenneth Branagh, (WALLANDER), plays Thomas Mendip, a war-weary drifter who appears in a medieval town asking to be executed.  But sparks fly when the beautiful Jennet Jourdemayne, played by Cherie Lunghi, (HORATIO HORNBLOWER) seeks sanctuary from accusations of witchcraft.  Angela Thorne, (TO THE MANOR BORN), plays  Margaret Devise.  Bernard Hepton, (GANDHI), plays Hebble Tyson. This is based on a madly successful 1948 theatrical rhyming verse play by Christopher Fry, and appears to be a filmed stage performance. It is somewhat stage-bound and dated if that matters to you.

Disc 5
The Death of the Heart
In gorgeous art-nouveau 1930s London, an awkward orphaned 16-year-old girl struggles to fit in with her frosty upper-crust relatives. Their cruelty leads her into a ruinous love affair that cracks the elegant veneer of their polished lives.  With Robert Hardy, (ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL) as Major Brutt; Miranda Richardson  (SLEEPY HOLLOW) as Daphne Heccomb; Patricia Hodge (MIRANDA), who seems to be channeling Phyllida Law, as Anna Quayne; Nigel Havers, noted portrayer of upper-class twits, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, EMPIRE OF THE SUN, as Thomas Quayne; and the great Wendy Hiller ( MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, ELEPHANT MAN) as  Matchett.  Based upon a novel by the Dublin-born, definitely upper-crust Elizabeth Bowen, who was orphaned herself and raised by aunts; I think we can assume she knew whereof she spoke.

We really enjoyed this collection.  The acting, photography, costumes, set decoration seem accurate and are evocative; despite the costumes, the clashes  portrayed are eternal; the screens are filled with meaningful activity.  And there is great intelligence displayed throughout.  It's a keeper.",1402012800,5,4439,5.354466858789626
8647751,5,B00J3M53Q2,"The Lady's Not for Burning, made for tv in 1987, offers a superb performance by Kenneth Branagh, in his 20's, before he directed and starred in his screen adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. I've been waiting many years for this program to be released on dvd. His co-star, Cherie Lunghi, went on to play his mother in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  A witty and romantic play (and screenplay) written by Christopher Fry.",1401408000,9,419,4.901408450704225
8647752,5,B00J3M53Q2,"'Classic Drama' or 'Costume Drama', it's good stuff.
Jane Austen, Bronte, Bowen, Fry and Collins are noted writers to adapt to TV. A nice collection with each its own disc in one case.
SUBTITLES are provided for all 5 features. Some are also available as a single release, but the collection is worthy. Lavish detailed sets for each, including one treated as almost theater play style. Listed below in the order on the DVD box.

EMMA: Beckinsale's Emma role is debatable best. My wife's watched 3x. We own 3 versions, including Paltrow's Emma, and find this adaptation preferable. Mark Strong does a good job as Knightley. Plenty of actors to praise: Samantha Morton (also `Jane Eyre' in this DVD set) is a believable Harriet; Prunella Scales is hands-down the best Miss Bates ever with her annoying fast-talk. Mr. Churchill (Raymond Coulthard) & Jane Fairfax (Olivia Williams) are so adoring they must have been the parents of `Barbie'. Of course the story is the misadventures of Emma attempting beyond her safe capability of matchmaking. Her successes soon turn to disaster, even for her own romance. It is as much a comedy as it is romantic drama, with such lovely period costumes, scenery, and all things period pleasant. A top adaptation of Jane Austen's novel.

JANE EYRE: Victorian rags-to-riches? No. Institutionalized by her aunt (Deborah Findlay -Cranford), Jane's life can't BE worse. As Thornfield governess, its wealthy owner Mr Rochester (Ciaran Hinds), Jane trifles with love after an undignified start. The house & staff hide secrets. This version focuses on her relationship with her master, the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story by Charlotte Bronte. A fine cast. Samantha Morton is believable as Jane. Gemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax) plays Mrs Fairfax here, and has been a favorite of ours since she starred in `The Duchess of Duke Street.' My wife and I both liked this DVD version of Jane Eyre, better than 2 other adaptations we own (1971 and 2011) even though we did much approve of one of our favorite actresses, Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax, in the latter.

The Woman in White: Wilkie Collins Victorian mystery.  Half-sister nieces of Limmeridge owner Mr Fairlie (Ian Richardson -Becoming Jane) unravel a conspiracy that includes a mysterious lady in white gown & veil. Fairlie hires art tutor Hartright (Andrew Lincoln -Love Actually) for the girls, Laura and Marian. Justine Waddel (Wives and Daughters) plays Laura well in her first acting role. Tara Fitzgerald (Jane Eyre '06) is Marian. Sinister encounters, crime, secrets, and nightmares prevail through the summertime of young passions. All the while the insane illusive Woman in White comes and goes, day and night, but from where no one knows. Delightful film period perfection, down to the fine English houses, and a story with a surprise twist that was unexpected to me.

The Lady's Not for Burning: Thomas (Kenneth Branagh -Henry V) tired of the world, stops to ask the Mayor (Bernard Hepton) for his immediate hanging. This tends to be a bit of a spoof on theater tragedy/comedy/drama. Witty script. Curtain opens with Thomas talking in humorous riddles to a clerk. Alizon (Susannah Harker -Pride and Prejudice) arrives betrothed but in confusion as to which brother is her intended. Bells ring in the street announcing a witch hunt underway. The witch arrives, a rich witch of beauty called Jennet (Cherie Lunghi -The Brief) desiring to avoid a burning death. The opposites of a seeker to be hung, and a witch wishing life is comical and touching. It is a comedy with such delightful characters. The writer of both the play and adapted screenplay (Christopher Fry) must have studied Dickens. Also a poignant look at the frivolity of life.

The Death of the Heart: A story set in 1937, an adaptation of a novel by Elizabeth Bower. London is not an easy place at the time to find love and maturity for a 16-yr-old girl who has lost her parents and forced to live with her brother (Nigel Hayers) and step-sis (Patricia Hodge). She gets involved with a young gad-about platonically, and also with a worn-out Maj Brutt (Robert Hardy -`Sense and Sensibility' `Middlemarch'). Mrs Heccomb's (Phyllis Calvert -Little Women) seaside cottage visit is delightful play but a turning point toward disaster. Sophie Thompson as maid Doris is only her 8th role but later plays Miss Bates in `Emma' 1996.  A diary is involved. My least favorite of this collection, but overall what a fine set of 5 dramas is to be had.",1400630400,6,5094,5.465057179161373
