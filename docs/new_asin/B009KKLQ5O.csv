The pacing is good, not fast but moving so you get breathless; the exercises are doable with two levels if one is too challenging or you tire and need to lower the level; and Joshua Smith's instruction is super clear with form, breathing, and timely reminders. I like that you do two moves three times with a timer, with four rotations. For example, you do boomerang rollups (where you sit on floor, cross your legs, roll onto your back bringing the legs overhead, switch the cross, then roll down again, hold in a ""V"", and then repeat) for a minute, and then you do butterfly bridges for about 75 seconds. Smith really coaches well, and the two people are really good at demonstrating the moves. Very abs oriented, which works for me. Smith is encouraging, and says be consistent and have fun. How positive! Highly recommend.",1431216000,2,913,4.573170731707317
8542545,3,B009KKLQ5O,"I like the PHIIT workout because it provides a good core and abs workout.  However, it is not very intense and I don't get my heart rate up as much as the title suggests I should.  I think the high intensity interval training label is misleading, so I am only rating this a ""3"".",1385683200,5,278,4.12962962962963
8542546,5,B009KKLQ5O,"I really enjoyed this workout and consider it an excellent addition to barre workouts. You get a nice cardio workout that will not bulk you up.  The intervals will work your core, butt, and abs.  Perfect exercise if like me you are looking for cardio but want to get toned in the right places at the same time.  The time went by quickly and the instruction was very clear.",1369872000,3,372,4.36231884057971
8542547,5,B009KKLQ5O,The instructions provided by the coach are clear and concise.  There are two levels to follow so you can pick your workout and work up to the higher level.  Definitely a good workout.,1361404800,,183,4.515151515151516
