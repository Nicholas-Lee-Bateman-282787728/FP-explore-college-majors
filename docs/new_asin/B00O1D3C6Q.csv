6699450,5,B00O1D3C6Q,"Very glad the price was very competitive/low as the only movie I personally want/like is Naughty or Nice.  On a personal note, I didn't enjoy the other three movies and immediately donated them to a charity so that someone else can enjoy them as we all have different tastes.
There is just something about Naughty or Nice that appealed to me as I once in a blue moon like a ""girly"" movie but without all the kissy, kissy garbage.  This had more than that (neighborhood, workplace).
I gave it five stars as I love the one movie and the price came to about $1.49 per movie so very worth it for the one movie and I helped a charity raise money with the other three.",1520985600,,662,4.288

6699489,3,B00O1D3C6Q,"I liked all four movies to a degree, my least favorite was Its Christmas, Carol!  The photo of Carrie Fisher gives a false impression of what the movie really is, which is just another rip-off of A Christmas Carol.  This one features Emmanuelle Vaugier in the role of Scrooge.  Unfortunately, she is unlikeable from her first appearance to her last.  Her change is very last minute and feels as though she put very little thought into it.  Carrie Fisher is fun, but she is not the star.  As for the other three films in this set, they are average.  The first one has a family stranded over the holidays.  The Wishing Tree features a cynical teacher with little love for the season.  Naughty or Nice also features a person who isn't fond of Christmas because she was named after Santa and lives on Candy Cane Lane.  This seems to be an ongoing theme for Hallmark.  Convert a Christmas hater to someone who finds the joy of the season.  Its not terribly original, but why give up the rut you're in?",1513555200,,996,4.472222222222222

M-O-S-T of the reviewers: ""bought this because it was the ONLY way to buy ONE of the movies.""
Of course, two other reviewers disagreed, saying it is ""the ONLY way to buy ONE of the OTHER movies.""

I have a few points NOT mentioned by others. NAUGHTY OR NICE was also my favorite. It featured the former
star of one of my favorite [as usual], cancelled, television series: KYLE XY.  Interestingly enough, the man that
played Santa Claus---Googy Gress---had h-i-s name spelled correctly in the end-credits, but, Santa Clause [sic]
was misspelled! ""The Santa Clause"" was a MOVIE title. In ALIENS, ""sergeant"" is misspelt---ugh!---sargeant!
Nice seeing, TV-regulars, Michael Gross and Merideth Baxter[-Birney] again.
In regards to W-H-I-C-H would be enjoyed, most, by the entire family, I'd vote for THE TOWN CHRISTMAS FORGOT.
IT'S CHRISTMAS, CAROL was a good spin on ""A Christmas Carol""... with Carrie Fisher.
THE WISHING TREE was a favorite as it had The Deputy from EUREKA; look close for brief appearances from
the stable of actors that never get their JUST-DOs for great work.

I have to agree to disagree. All FOUR of these movies ARE keepers!
I have all four of The Hallmark Holiday Collections...

We bought this for Naughty or Nice, it's a silly, goofy, weird movie, but it's become a Christmas classic for us (yeah yeah, I know it's not in the same league as It's a Wonderful Life or Christmas Carol. Lighten-up). It follows the adventures of Krissy Kringle who is accidentally sent Santa's Naughty/Nice book, to which she uses to get into and out of bad situations. She loses her job and ends up working in a mall as one of Santa's Elves. Hilarity ensues. We haven't watched the other movies in the collection, yet (maybe next year), but I can honestly write that it was worth buying the set just for this one movie.

8681356,4,B00O1D3C6Q,"I've seen The Town Christmas Forgot and The Wishing Tree, and they're both solid. I haven't seen It's Christmas, Carol! so you're on your own with that one. I'm here for Naughty Or Nice, which first aired in 2012 but still doesn't have its own DVD release. What follows is what I think of that movie.

And some plot spoilers now...

Krissy Kringle (Hilarie Burton) lives on Candy Cane Lane, and she's not okay with it. She tells everyone who'd listen that she moved into her street before it was changed to Candy Cane Lane. She's heard the jokes ad nauseam that go with having her name. You can't blame her for being a bit resentful come the yuletide season. On her block, hers is the only house to go undecorated. The only light she has on is her porch light. Ooops, light just went out.

Krissy is having one of her crappiest Christmases. No hot water in her house. Credit card declined. Broken porch light. But at least she's up for a promotion at her ad agency. Just this past month she's brought three new accounts to Purcell Advertising. Look, her boss, Helen, just called her into her office... to fire her. So, now, no job, either. Luckily, she lands a new gig later that evening.

Except it's a hell of a step down going from chic ad executive to minimum wage gift wrapper at the mall. To maximize her chagrin, Krissy finds out she has to put on an elf costume.

On to something else. She's trying not to let it bother her, but she's been with her lawyer boyfriend, Lance (Matt Dallas), for six years now, and still no proposal. Krissy loves the guy. She also desperately wants to change her last name for obvious reasons. At a dinner with her parents, when her mom raises that same issue, oboy, Lance's silence is palpable.

It's Christmastime on Candy Cane Lane, and, in Krissy's solitary household, each day finds an avalanche of kids' letters addressed to Kris Kringle. One evening, as Krissy weeds thru a heap of mail, she comes across a mysterious, torn package. And, no, she shouldn't have opened it. But she did, and it's a book titled Naughty or Nice, the back of it titled Nice or Naughty. She shrugs it off, tosses the book aside somewhere.

Naughty Or Nice is a 2012 Hallmark movie that will delight you but, also, make you cringe in spots. The plot puts Hilarie Burton's character thru her paces. Krissy soon enough learns that the book comes with weird properties. It allows her, at a mere mention of a name, to peek at that person at their moment of weakness. And our girl, she's not above allowing vindictiveness to motivate her. There's Krissy gleefully exposing the naughty deeds of her tormentors. The rewards are immediate. The plumber that didn't want to come to restore her hot water? Just gave her a 50% discount on account of Krissy's having caught him in a lie. Her new boss at the mall - with the Australian accent even though he's not Australian - who's been bullying the staff? Fixed him, too. And so on.

Krissy's lucky to have made a friend at her mall job. Gabriel Tigerman plays Marco, Krissy's gift-wrapping co-worker, and he's fantastic as Krissy's sidekick and snags a string of amusing one-liners. He's the one person Krissy confides in about the book.

- Krissy: ""So crazy, but this might be the real naughty or nice list. Who else would have a book like this?""
- Marco: ""The CIA.""

I mentioned ""cringe in spots."" It's to do with those moments in which Krissy loses it and has these public freak-out moments. Burton slays these hilariously uncomfortable scenes, although you're glad it's not you caught in that same humiliating situation. And, throughout, she retains her appeal so that you don't turn against her, even though some of the stuff she gets up  to are mean-spirited, like how she outs her neighbor.

Will Krissy learn her lesson? Does a bear sh-- in the woods? This is Hallmark. In due time, it dawns on Krissy that she needs to see the nice in people, instead of focusing only on the naughty.

For fans of Family Ties, there's a mini-reunion in that Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter play Krissy's Christmas-obsessed parents.

One of the best visuals in the movie is whenever the camera pans up and down Krissy's block and we're treated to a grand view of all those festively lit, extravagantly decorated houses, including the awesome hologram reindeer loping around on that one roof. The collective electric bill for Candy Cane Lane come December must be murder!",1532217600,,4423,4.625
