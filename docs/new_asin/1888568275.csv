7800944,5,1888568275,"Very likely this is the first anti-rock film out there.  Based on the pictured content on the film, the last scenes were shot about March or April, 1982.

The menu on ROCK is Play, Setup, and Trailers.  There's no provision for ""scenes"" within the play (running time is 52:49), so if you want to check around the movie during playback, you have to use your FF and Rewind keys on your remote.  The Trailers section consists of twenty short 30-second trailers for other period Christian indie films, though none of them center on music issues.

The source for this DVD-R (""purple"" playing surface, professionally inked ""label"" side) seems to be from a bright if somewhat blurry print or master.  The scenes feature period record albums and books in the shots, but the detail runs to indistinct if you try to stop and zoom.

The youth advisor gives what are three books to the ""Jeff"" character to research rock music, and checking the scenes featuring those books, it appears that the books referenced in the movie are for Frank Garlock's THE BIG BEAT, A ROCK BLAST pamphlet (1971), Bob Larson's ROCK pocket paperback's 1978 edition, and Bob Larson's THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED 1972+ paperback (his updated 1966 book, THE DEVIL'S DIVERSION anti-rock book).

Rock albums shown in various scenes include:
Lynyrd Skynyrd's first Lp (1973) on MCA
Linda Ronstadt's HEART LIKE A WHEEL Capitol Lp (1975)
Bob Seger's NINE TONIGHT Capitol 2 Lp set (1981)
Rod Stewart's TONIGHT I'M YOURS album (1981)
Billy Joel's PIANO MAN Columbia Lp (1973)
and mentions of various pop artists such as Captain & Tennille, Kiss, Rolling Stones (from the TATTOO YOU Lp), etc....  The latest album (very briefly) pictured in the film which dates the final scenes for the movie is Iron Maiden's NUMBER OF THE BEAST March, 1982 album, racked in Camelot Music at the mall near the movie's end.

The plot of the film mentions Frank Garlock's theory that ""the beat"" in rock music is addictive.  Missing from the narrative, however, is any mention of the newly publicized backward masking allegations that were taking off in mid-1982.",1508889600,,2093,4.867605633802817
7800945,5,1888568275,"For the person who has been walking with the Lord and fighting their flesh all along the way, this is an excellent movie despite the 'bad' acting. For the unbelieving or the one who mocks this movie, I suggest looking up 2 Corinthians 4:4. I know the power of music, especially rock/metal. Before I was converted (Matt. 13:15; Matt. 18:3; Luke 22:32), rock was my 'god'. I WANTED to go to hell (AC/DC Highway to Hell). My 'bible' was the lyrics I steadily fed my mind with. What you put in your mind comes out in your worldview which determines your behavior and your behavior determines your future. Thank God, He rescued me from that life nearly 30 years ago. I probably wouldn't be here now otherwise. Satan is behind secular song-writing, I assure you. And he knows what he's doing, and he's succeeding.",1493337600,2,807,4.611111111111111
7800946,5,1888568275,"I realized this was a budget film but I think the message is good. What I really enjoyed however was seeing familiar sites and it dawned on me that this was filmed in my home town of Huntsville, Alabama. It's not everyday you see a movie made there.",1489449600,,249,4.208333333333333
7800947,1,1888568275,"This movie simply was terrible. It's about Jeff that is browbeaten into swearing off rock music for a period of time. In this time he turns into a self-righteous turd that alienates everyone around him. If you are into stupidity, homophobic attitudes and downright lies about the music mentioned, you should check it out. If not, ignore it.",1398816000,7,340,4.879310344827586
7800948,5,1888568275,"This movie is from the late 70's or early 80's and so is the music.  However the message is NOT dated and applies even to our music Today!  I encourage those seeking to live Christ like lives, those that are New in Christ (Welcome! :D ) or those that are living already for Christ but are questioning about whether they should be listening to ""The Worlds"" Music, to give this movie a watch!  The message is great, and Very True.  If you are not saved, not interested in Christ, this movie may not be for you, and you'll most likely end up missing the message all together since you are still considered spiritually blinded. I hope you can some how find a way to take the message serious.  To my fellow Saved brothers and sisters, we must filter what we allow into our minds, our thoughts. The devil is hard at work generating alot of trash out there to trap us with, and bring us down with him.  God Bless",1394928000,6,905,4.294117647058823
7800949,2,1888568275,"The message is a good one, if flawed: can a devout Christian teenager (Jeff) work rock music into his life w/o it contradicting his beliefs? However, someone didn't do their research, judging by the songs cited in Jeff's grandoise change-of-heart speech that ends the film and elsewhere:

- Billy Joel's ""Captain Jack"", while about heroin use, actually makes fun of drug addicts
- Santana's ""Evil Ways""...how hard would it have been to find out the song's about a guy wanting the woman in his life to *change* her evil ways?
- The Stones' ""Sympathy For the Devil"", which is actually about Satan taking responsibility for various tragedies throughout history, and thus conveys the opposite of its title
- Jefferson Starship's ""Dance w/the Dragon"", whose title merely alludes to the fact that it was written in the (Chinese) Year of the Dragon

If this seems like trite propaganda, it's no accident: the primary source for Jeff's research is Frank Garlock's ""The Big Beat"", one of several reactionary Christian literary works devoted to the supposed ""evils"" of rock music, not to mention that Garlock himself is/was a music professor at the ultra-conservative Bob Jones University (which recieved attention during the 2000 Presidential election for its infamous ""no interracial dating"" policy, though it's since been lifted)...in fact, both Garlock and his book recieve a ""Special Thanks"" mention in the closing credits.

Thus, it's nothing more than propaganda for those who attack things like Dungeons and Dragons, the Harry Potter series, etc. as an apocryphal boogeyman to pin their child's behavior on w/o really knowing about their content. To further prove that point, consider this: co-star Glenn Williams IV turned up a couple of years back on the forum for a website devoted to bad movies like this and had a good laugh about the experience!",1214265600,12,1849,5.1158940397351
7800950,1,1888568275,"This video is shameless in its exploitation of the fear of rock & roll music.  Think ""Reefer Madness"" for rock.  The worst part is, when they talk about how evil the lifestyles of the rock starts are, the kid is looking at a BILLY JOEL ALBUM!!!!!  C'mon, at least pick Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath or someone with a darker image, but Billy Joel?  HAHAHAHAHA",986860800,18,358,4.461538461538462
