8374285,5,B002MWIYYI,This is a silent film. That would make you think that you'd get bored.  I did not get bored at all.  It can hold it's own.  It actually has a great story line to it.  It is artsy and just really good.  LOVE IT,1468454400,,209,3.659090909090909
8374286,5,B002MWIYYI,"This was Miss Bronsons first film after the hugely succesful 'Peter Pan'. Peter Pan made Betty a huge star and gave her a massive fanbase. You can imagine how hugely anticipated the release of 'Are Parents People?' was in 1925. How would the sweet girl that portraid Peter Pan so delightfully fare in a cosmopolitan movie without fairies, pirates..?
Well, she pulls all the stops in this wonderful movie. Peter Pan turns out to be a sweet young lady with a memorable performance thats entertaining and light hearted.
The wonderful Florence Vidor and Adolphe Menjou are here too, two heavyweights of the era.
Even if you're new to silent films, this film is special.
There is a charleston soundtrack with the movie, flows well with the motion.
The dvd copy is fair, I don't think this film has had much restoration (what is going on with the major studios and their total lack of interest of preserving and promoting these wonderful films from the dawn of cinema??..)
This is the only copy out there, so although the image can be a bit rough at times, this surviving copy is highly watchable and you will forget the minor fuzziness in the motion as you will be drawn into the wonderful world of Lira and her quarreling parents.
If you're reading this, most likely you have an interest in these classic films or willing to give it a chance.
Get it! If you like it, a whole catalogue of amazing films await. If you don't, well, you have to apreciate that in 1925 this was the rage and fans went crazy over this...",1341705600,3,1510,4.575645756457565
