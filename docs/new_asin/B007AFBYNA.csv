5071565,5,B007AFBYNA,"If you are a fan of Degrassi, you should definitely purchase this DVD of the show. You will not be disappointed!",1344384000,,112,4.380952380952381
5071566,4,B007AFBYNA,"If you're a Degrassi fan, I recommend getting DVD sets of your favorite seasons. It's good to have a physical copy, and this is a great price for 29 episodes.

Season 11 part 1 has some really strong episodes, and only a few weak ones. As for the DVDs themselves, the box art is nice and the special features alone are worth the money. There are only 2 episodes with commentary unfortunately. The other bonus features make up for it. I really liked the set tour.

I gave it 4 stars because I hate the DVD menu. It does the job, but that's about it. Navigating the menu is difficult, and the menu music is really loud compared the the actual episodes. I'm not a fan of the double sided DVDs either, but it does save space on the shelf. Those are minor complaints though, because the content here is good.",1341532800,3,803,4.311258278145695
5071567,5,B007AFBYNA,Very good. Got it in no time. Waiting for season 11 part 2 to come out now! Sure it will be just as good,1341273600,,104,3.375
5071568,5,B007AFBYNA,"Degrassi is one of the greatest show's on TV involving teen's and teen issues such as drugs, relationships, and much more. This Season went beyond the past 10 season's of how much drama their was. The season starts with an appearance from KeKe Palmer and she did the best job with her work on the show. This season will have the most intense moments starting with Bianca's past which leads Drew into a lot of trouble. This season features 29 episodes which is a lot of dramatic action until the end. This season will have seniors graduating and being done with their year's at Degrassi. Best show ever for all the hard work they put into it and this season was entitled Degrassi Now Or Never which was last summer and ran for 7 weeks. I love Degrassi and it will never get old.",1331337600,10,777,4.402777777777778

8513244,5,B007AFBYNA,"Bought the dvds cuz I missed some of the season, and it was cheaper than amazon instant video.
Plus it also comes with behind the scenes extra, which I am not sure are included on Amazon instant.
The show is great, the set up is a pain in the ass, had to get up multiple times since each side only hold a few episodes.
Hope they fix the design of the dvds or atleast put them out in blu ray.
If you don't like Degrassi or cant get over the Old Characters leaving then you might not enjoy this.
Must Have for any Degrassi fan.",1362960000,,525,4.0095238095238095
8513245,3,B007AFBYNA,I just spent thirty minutes trying to figure out which disc is which! I bought this product new and the discs were out of order in the case and were marked incorrectly. This was rather annoying and now I'm not sure how I will know which disc is which in the future,1362182400,,264,4.096153846153846
