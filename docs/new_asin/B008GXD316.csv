5160723,3,B008GXD316,"I can't say it was bad, but it was a bit painful to watch. First off, this IS a musical! The acting and production were fine, but the singing was not the best.  Olivia was the only one who could actually sing (and she sounded great, as usual) and the lead actor was alright, but the rest of the cast are not in any way ""singers"".  Although the story was interesting, I have to say that the movie is for Hardcore ONJ fans only!",1351123200,2,426,4.059523809523809

5160725,3,B008GXD316,"If you are a hockey fan, you will enjoy this. some of the worst lyrics and most mundane choreography ever, but it's still fun. If you don't get hockey, and more especially Canada's passion for the game, skip it.",1401235200,,211,4.435897435897436
5160726,5,B008GXD316,"The movie itself is so so, but for Olivia Newton John fans it's a must! It's always great to see Olivia in any movie, in this one she also sings, which is always fun to watch. Her lines in the songs are often funny ( ""you get frostbite on your.."")  and refreshing, she also looks really cute and has such a charisma both as a singer and actress. The songs here are musical scores, not stand alone songs ( except Huggs) , but they perfectly fit the movie. Highly recommended for Olivia fans like myself!",1400976000,4,502,4.28421052631579

5160729,5,B008GXD316,"what a fun movie.  certainly not an academy award winner - but the music is passable, the shots of toronto in winter accurate and beautiful, the list of guest stars quite decent.  great flick...i highly recommend.",1367020800,2,213,4.888888888888889
5160730,2,B008GXD316,"UGH.  I love a good cheesy movie (especially Olivia's; see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xanadu/dp/B001JV5BEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xanadu</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-of-a-Kind/dp/B00020HB4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two of a Kind</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Romance/dp/B005CFBZC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Romance</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mom-for-Christmas/dp/B001JOXWD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mom for Christmas</a>), but this was definitely a bad cheesy movie.  The songs were horrendous, and the storyline was very mediocre.  I've seen better After-School Specials.  Worst of all, Olivia is touted as a star of the movie, but she's hardly in it!  (However, she IS the best vocalist in the movie, without a doubt, despite her few and far between appearances.)  Her character was pretty one-dimensional and lame, too.  And couldn't they have gotten someone more attractive to play her husband?  Sheesh.  This movie would have been better off not trying to go down the musical route.",1364774400,2,1223,8.642857142857142
5160731,4,B008GXD316,This is another movie I wouldn't have even looked at without Olivia Newton-John. It was amusing and the price was fair so I am glad to have it in the collection.,1360454400,,161,4.225806451612903

8527742,3,B008GXD316,"I am only rating this three stars because it's a musical about hockey (aka: A for Effort?). I was so excited when I saw this existed. It looked like it might fit the description of a typical Hallmark-style movie. Far from it. Horrendously not-funny, this movie is two pucks away from being an C movie (that's worse than a B movie!!!). I love hockey but not even I could bring myself to love this one...",1477008000,,402,4.373333333333333
8527743,5,B008GXD316,"This musical is hilarious.  We watched this together as a familly when my sister who lives in Canada recommended it.  My teenage boys were a little skeptical, but they like it as well.  I have even caught them singing some of the songs.  The one about hockey fights is a favorite.  We enjoyed viewing it many times since our first viewing.",1454544000,2,339,4.491803278688525
8527744,1,B008GXD316,I LOVE musicals. I LOVE hockey. I adore Olivia Newton John....but this is just SO AWFUL. I couldn't even finish watching it. It's so cheese ball and the music are more like lymrics only not funny...don't buy this...you can have mine for free,1447632000,2,241,4.627906976744186

8527747,1,B008GXD316,"Olivia Fans, BUY IT.  Olivia is beautiful to behold in all her pre-collagen glory.  Most of her singing is recorded live on the set; but most of the songs are like ""Happy Birthday to You"" and it would be silly to pre-record songs like that for a movie.  In duets and trios, it's clear Olivia is singing live while the camera is rolling, while the less experienced singer/actors had their vocals pre-recorded and dubbed during post production.

The director is no Randal Kleiser (""Grease"" and ""It's My Party""), who was adamant about capturing Olivia on film at her best (perfect lighting, perfect facial expression, etc.).  Poor, improper placement of lights, reflectors and diffusers did not fill in shadows across Olivia's face, so in some shots, she looked older than her age.  Artistic cinematographers and skilled lighting technicians cost money.  The director of ""Score"" apparently had to scrimp and scrape to acquire the film's measly budget.

In short, the film is ""Glee On Ice.""  The music and lyrics have ""high school"" and ""student-written"" all over them, as does the narrative.  The plot is standard grist for formulaic teen romance stories, and the dialog is just as pedestrian.  Egomaniac Ed Wood could have written the script and music.

Pat Birch choreographed ""Grease"" and she demonstrated her talent and vision most especially during large crowd dancing scenes (""The National Dance-Off"" in the high school gymnasium and the ""We Go Together"" finale).  Coordinated dancing in which huge numbers of people are all doing the same thing can be striking visually.  ""Score"" scores an unexpected point or two when a sizable group of hockey players suddenly breaks out in song and performs a rather imaginative dance routine on ice.  Bright red hockey suits make for a colorful scene on the screen as the men move in unison.  It would be a mistake to base the merit of the entire movie solely on this scene.  The dancing group of hockey players provides the film's only highlight.

Musical films are difficult to make.  The movie screen is not a theater stage, where musicals unfold most effectively.  The theater audience expects characters to sing a song at the drop of a hat.  The distance from the audience to the stage creates a kind of buffer that makes the transition from dialog to song less jarring.  Film is an entirely different medium.  The audience is more intimate with characters on screen because of the illusion of close proximity.

Well executed film musicals are those in which the audience becomes almost unaware of the transition from the spoken word to the sung lyric.  An effective set of music and lyrics seamlessly becomes part of the narrative and helps to further the plot along.  Songs and music affect the audience differently than dialog.  Music excites a different part of the brain.  The transition from dialog to song must be smooth; otherwise, an abrupt, illogical transition can be quite jarring to the senses.

It is in this regard that ""Score"" runs afoul.  There are no carefully crafted juxtapositions between dialog and song.  It's as if the writer mindlessly plopped songs in the middle of scenes with no regard to whether it made sense cinematically or whether it was necessary to insert a musical number to accentuate or add to the narrative.  The writer of THIS musical, unfortunately, had no idea how to write a musical for film and, I fear, for even the stage.  Since the writer and director are the same man, I wish I'd been a fly on the wall to witness what and whose strings he had to pull to get the green light for this project.

So what is ""Score""?  It's a hodgepodge of scenes, whose order is dictated by a mere thread of a plot.  There are two types of scenes:  Musical and non-musical.  Scenes in which the actors have lines to speak are made cartoonish by the manner in which the actors deliver their lines.  The actors do not create characters whom they embody; rather, they create caricatures whom they merely animate with broad gestures, exaggerated facial expressions, and delivering lines with all the real-life subtlety of a trumpeting elephant.

However...

If you are an Olivia Newton-John fan, BUY THIS.  Buy this DVD for no other reason than to watch Olivia.  Despite the fact that she's buried up to her neck in a clump of dirt and was unable to escape it until the director said, ""It's a wrap!,"" she still displays that certain charm, that certain je ne sais quoi, which endeared her to millions of fans from the moment the world first laid eyes on her.",1431216000,,4527,4.8095854922279795
8527748,4,B008GXD316,Fun musical but the lyrics are often painful to listen to.  Fun seeing hockey players sing and dance on ice but wish there was more of these type of scenes. Left me wanting more....,1425600000,,181,4.323529411764706
