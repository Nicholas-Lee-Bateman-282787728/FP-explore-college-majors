I went to his lecture and his enthusiasm is so palpable as he takes us on a journey, cross referencing and making it so accessible. He named us all ring junkies and Indeed getting this dvd set is like taking him home for a joyous lifetime study.",1431734400,,324,4.241935483870968
8621457,5,B00G9HJ63A,"I attended a 3+ hour presentation by Prof. Lees at the Wagner Society of New York on May 10.  All 70-80 fellow attendees, who are devotees of Wagner's music, were literally blown away by this deeply knowledgeable, erudite, witty and entertaining man.  Not only did he describe, analyze and interpret the many selections he played from piano reductions of the Ring score, he explained how some of Wagner's contemporaries and later composers used chords and musical phrases first introduced by Wagner in their own compositions.

I understand Prof. Lees' lecture/demo was not identical to the material recorded in his ""Tale Told in Music,"" but if his oral presentation is any indication, the 4-DVD set should be a terrific addition to any Wagnerian's collection as well as a unique introduction to the Ring for music lovers intent on learning about Wagner's music.",1431216000,2,861,5.092198581560283
8621458,5,B00G9HJ63A,"I have been researching on Wagner for more than 25 years. This DVD set is a wonderful addition to Wagner scholarship. There are many new insights on the music of the Ring that cannot be found elswhere. Up to now, we only had the monumental Deryck Cooke's ""Introduction to Der Ring Des Nibelungen"" on audio CD that addressed the analysis of the music. There are many audio and video programs that tell the story of the Ring but do not explain the music. There are hundreds or thousands of books and journal articles on analysis of the music of Wagner's operas. But this is the first time we have a through analysis of the music of the Ring Cycle on DVD with general public in mind. You do not have to be a musician to enjoy this set. Professor Lees skillfully explains the music and plays examples on the piano in a way understandable by the general public interested in Wagner. It must be mentioned that you will recieve the DVD in a format that is playable in your area. Highly recommended.",1383523200,4,991,4.450549450549451
