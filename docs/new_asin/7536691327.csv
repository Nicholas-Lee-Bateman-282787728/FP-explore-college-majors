Persona - Originally some the earlier Bergman films harder for me to get into, because most of the Bergman I saw first were from late in his career
and far more 'naturalistic' - 'Fanny and Alexander', 'Autumn Sonata', 'Scenes From a Marriage' etc. I don't think I understood that for much of his great career he was as much an experimentalist (at times) as David Lynch, or Fellini, or Kubrick or Godard. Now that I understand that, it's easier for me to get excited by the earlier experimental work.

Also, with 'Persona' the experiment seems more subtle and complex than in some of Bergman's other early work. The themes are right out in the open but there's much less literalness in the questions. The whole FILM is a series of questions, but posed in a poetic way - what is identity? What is acting? What is film? What are the boundaries between people? What is reality and what is a dream, both in this film, and in our ownexperiences?

This is a haunting deeply disturbing work, and part of it's very effectiveness is it's 'unexplainability', ala '2001' or a Magritte painting. Like a Koan, it forces you to try and make sense of something that has no simple answer.

On first viewing there were a few times when things felt a little on the nose, or my feeling of 'huh?' was the bad kind, not the good one.

But this is a fascinating film, that combines some of the most truly dreamlike sequences I've ever seen with what seems a conventional narrative, only to curve in on itself into obscurity yet again. It is ultimately the kind of puzzle that art does best - it makes you ponder things both consciously and subconsciously at the same time.

The two lead performances by Bibi Anderson and Liv Ullmann are extraordinary, and Sven Nykvist again creates a series of unforgettable images (now with the wider palate that Bergman started towards in 'The Silence' - more camera moves, more 'cinematic' angles.).

But the nexus of this film, isn't the acting or the photography (though the film would fail miserably without both being great), this is a film about the inside of the filmmaker's mind, and by extension the inside of all of our minds as we fight to make sense of the lives we lead.

It also has the single most erotic scene where nothing physical happens I've ever encountered. And it's that kind of paradox that 'Persona' is all about. I know I will get more from repeated viewings. The film begs for it.

It's also impossible to note how many films since have borrowed its techniques and images. Indeed, after the rare moments I felt dismissively 'we've seen this idea before', I'd realize 'no we HADN'T seen it before Bergman made this film.

Shame - Dubbed a masterpiece by almost every critic I respect. I certainly thought this was a brilliantly well made film, but one that didn't quite give me the kind of devastating emotional effect experienced by so many.

In fact, going in knowing little about the film (I try to avoid reviews before I see a film), part of what I liked about it must seem like sacrilege to most, who see the film as completely, unbearably bleak. I may be insane, but I actually found a good portion of it powerfully, blackly funny, in a sort of 'Dr. Strangelove', Roy Andersson, dryly Scandanavian sort of way.

The surreal insanity of the behavior of the soldiers and officials around our normal working-class couple seemed so exaggerated, almost Keystone Cops with guns, that it DID seem effectively anti-war, but not in the way seen by those who cite it's unrelieved depression and misery as being where the film gets its power.

That said, it certainly seemed to grow ever more 'real', and by the end felt truly dramatic and haunting.

I wonder how I could so misread Bergman's intentions. Certainly, if we're supposed to take the early to middle completely seriously and literally the film would work much less well for me than it did, since the horrors these people are exposed to on a literal level seem like nothing compared to the victims of 'real world' wars, where they probably would have been dead very quickly.

Take this for what it probably is - an odd outlier opinion, and one that may be replaced when I see the film again, which I look forward to. But then, hopefully the occasional outlier can supply a useful alternate point of view.

Hour of the Wolf - This left me confused about whether it's a great film or merely an extremely entertaining one. As surreal and enigmatic as 'Persona', but with a lighter touch, more of a ghost story of a kind. However, it has the same self-reflective acknowledgment that you're watching a film, scenes that leave you wondering what's real and what's a dream, etc.

The themes don't seem as deep as ""Persona"", but that doesn't stop this from being deeply absorbing. It's still brilliant filmmaking, full of breathtaking images. And I have the feeling it will grow on repeated viewings,

A wife recounts the very odd series of events leading to her unstable artist-husband's disappearance when they stayed on an almost abandoned island.

Some of the smaller roles are intentionally - but I found annoyingly -played over the top.

No question that this film was a serious influence on David Lynch.

The Passion of Anna - his film represents some remarkable changes for Bergman; using color in as careful and striking away as had been using black and white, and a looser, less astringent feel to the story telling (indeed, this was the first film where he experimented with letting his actors
improvise). The film feels more human, the edges softer. On the other hands, the themes are classic middle period Bergman - lies vs., truth,
hope vs. despair, etc. And on a plot level there are some interesting echoes of 'Persona' in both its confused identities and Godard like interruptions, but in a much subtler more smoothly integrated style.

I found the wonderful acting and fascinating film-making choices overrode the problem of distance I feel with some of Bergman's early and middle work. I always admire the films; the bravery, the acting, the style, the deepness of their ideas, the complete lack of compromise. But sometimes I just don't feel as drawn in on a visceral level.

The story; four people on an island; an ex-criminal hiding from society, an architect with disdain for humanity and his fragile, insomniac wife, and their friend Anna whose husband and child died in a car wreck which left her with a limp all end up having their lives intertwine, leading to revelations and the stripping away of self-delusions.

The title 'The Passion of Anna' was an invention of the US distributor, over Bergman's favored 'A Passion'. This is a case where a wrong title can seriously effect one's perception of a film, since Anna is really a supporting character. Beyond this, 'A Passion' makes clear the fact that all four characters in the film are working their way through emotional destruction, as Christ went through physical destruction in The Passion. Further, the only title on screen is 'L 162', Only one professional critic I've read tried to make sense of the actual title's meaning (his guess: A file number that one of the four characters keeps various photographs, often of violence, under.)

The Serpent's Egg - While not a masterpiece, this is also far from the mess most critics took it for. An intelligent failure (or modest success) Bergman looks at Germany in the 20s as laying the groundwork for Hitler and the Nazis.

Liv Ullman is terrific, as always. And if David Carradine is only good, not great, he certainly didn't deserve the critical attacks he received. The nature of his character is a man so locked in passivity as to be enigmatic. You might not like that kind of character, but it's certainly not the actor's fault for carrying it out well.

Yes, some of it is slow, and some a bit obvious, but those charges could also be leveled against some Bergman films labeled masterpieces.

As a cautionary tale of where we were once before, and could end up again, I've certainly seen far worse. It has some truly chilling moments. And I think seeing it again may reveal even more...",1453939200,,8146,4.717605633802817
