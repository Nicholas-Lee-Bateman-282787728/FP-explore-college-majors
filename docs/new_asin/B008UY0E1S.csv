8530641,3,B008UY0E1S,"I am a Naruto fan, as you, the reader, probably are as well. That being said, before I bought this package, I had already seen the Naruto series. However, I would not recommend this product to a first time viewer for a couple of reasons. One, the production quality is just bad. The menus, disc art, cases, etc, are all better on the official Naruto merchandise have a better authentic feel, and don't seem as if they were photoshopped on the covers, boxes, and menus. It's a good ""photoshop"" quality, however, it takes away from the authenticity. If that doesn't bother you, the subtitle quality might. If you cannot understand Japanese, don't think you're going to understand the English subtles any easier. Much of these subtitles are either direct translations, making it very hard to understand what the characters are trying to convey, if you have not seen the episode before. The other half of the subtitles that are not direct translations, are just very, very poorly translated. The subtitles will not be correct grammatically, and much of the time, due to the very large differences between the syntax and structure of the English and Japanese languages, it will not make sense at all. Sarcasm, humor, and many other rhetorical devices that the characters use are very hard to catch due to the shoddy subtitles. The quality of the video itself is not fantastic, however does not detract from the experience like the subtitles do.

Basically, when you get down to it, nothing matters except for the nitty gritty episodes themselves. Personally, I don't care what the menus or the box art look like. However, the subtitles are a large hindrance to an otherwise fantastic purchase for a Naruto or anime lover. The price is right, the whole package is there, there are no production defects that I have experienced, the episodes all function properly, with no skipping, tearing, etc. But the overall shoddy quality takes away two stars from an otherwise 5 star product,",1373500800,11,1975,4.895522388059701
8530642,5,B008UY0E1S,"My dad got this for me for Christmas....It was the best gift EVER. Thanks Dad :D I have no complaints....everything, including the boxes, are in great condition.",1369267200,2,161,5.0
8530643,4,B008UY0E1S,"Its was great but the only problem is that the last movie don't work at all, i change even system to check if it was me and don't work...",1362355200,3,137,3.7586206896551726
8530644,4,B008UY0E1S,"Delivery was fast. I received it in 3 days. The box appearance looks cheap but in good condition. One of the boxes is broke. The DVD is loosen. It's Japanese audio only with English and Chinese Subtitle. Picture and Sound are acceptable. The picture is the original square size. All in all, I am satisfied.",1354233600,4,306,4.581818181818182
