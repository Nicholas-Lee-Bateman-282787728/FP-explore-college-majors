8046944,4,B0007D4MSQ,"Super Croc was very well done.  There were parts that had me on the edge of my seat.  My 7 & 5 year old sons really enjoyed this one. (5 stars).

Tigers of the Snow was well done as well.  There were some parts that I couldn't watch because of anticipation of what will happen. (5 stars).

Volcano - wasn't as good as the some of the others, but it was still decent. (4 stars)

Asteroids - I'm normally WAY into space videos, but I found this one really dull.  To be honest, I tuned it out and picked up my laptop and didn't pay attention to the video.  (3 stars) -- maybe I missed something?

Dinosaur Hunters - I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would.  This was the main reason I bought the combo pack.  My 7 year old son is really into dinosaurs.  The video was entertaining and well done.  (5 stars)

Surviving Everest - This one was so boring.  I just couldn't get into it.  (2 stars).",1368921600,,897,4.098265895953757
