8103262,5,B000E0ODLS,"I watched these programs when they first came on.  It takes me back a long, long time ago when the world was nicer and I was younger.  Betty White will always be one of my favorites...",1287705600,,184,4.083333333333333
8103263,3,B000E0ODLS,"I remember loving these series in the mid '50s when, I hate to admit, I was an early teen.  I thought Life with Elizabeth was hilarious and laughed out loud.  It was zany and silly and fun.  Love That Bob was sexy for its day (a little later than Life with Elizabeth if I remember correctly) with Cummings as a sexy photographer who romanced his models (and played his own grandfather as well).  Sadly, they haven't traveled well.  Not because there was lack of talent or creativity -- but times and mores and changed and they are very dated.  But it was interesting to see what we wore and what we thought was funny then.",1280361600,,622,4.3652173913043475
8103264,3,B000E0ODLS,"i purchased these for my 90 year old mother,and as i watched them,i was amazed at how funny we used to find these episodes. The 50's were a much simpler and free-er(?) time to live. I recall really looking forward to these sitcoms,when our whole family would gather 'round our tiny black and white tv,just to giggle together.(my mother loves them)",1252886400,,347,4.704918032786885
8103265,5,B000E0ODLS,"You can hardly go wrong with this package. 16 episodes each  of ""Love That  Bob"" and ""Life With Elizabeth"" at a great price. These are two sitcoms from the ""Good Old Days"". And talk about an ""All Star Cast"", There's Robert Cummings, Dwayne Hickman, Ann B. Davis, Rosemary DeCamp, in Love that Bob, and Betty White starring in Life with Elizabeth.  And while the picture quality may not perfect,  you're getting more than your money's worth. Definately a good deal!",1205539200,4,464,4.7625
