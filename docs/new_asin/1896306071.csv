202286,1,1896306071,"i bought this dvd because it is presented as a documentary of Bruce Lee, but beware....it is not! first you get 20 minutes with poor quality (i've seen better of these scenes) black & white scenes of the old chinese  bruce lee films. After that in about 2 minutes his lifestory is told (with  only pictures). And then you get a complete movie with a imitator called  Dragon Lee. Altough he is a pretty good fighter and does a good imitation.  This is not what i expected. The movie is very  very bad. And it is not  Bruce Lee !!! If you're looking for a good DVD documentary of bruce lee,  skip this one....it's a fake.!!!!",937958400,37,623,4.318965517241379

202301,2,1896306071,"A good jaunt through Bruce Lee's footage as a child star, but the Bruce Li segment (most of the movie) was too much.",1388534400,,116,4.086956521739131
202302,5,1896306071,Beware the documentary is very short.  However 39 minutes in the bonus movie with Dragon Lee is fantastic. The final scene's fight sequences and the way Dragon Lee destroys the bad guys is fantastic.  Give this movie a shot and you will be pleased! Also check out Champ vs. Champ starring Dragon Lee which is free on Amazon Prime and is a great old school martial art movie too.,1385596800,,378,4.463768115942029
202303,5,1896306071,i like just about anything about the great bruce lee the man who started the fascination with martial arts great,1379808000,,112,4.65

202306,2,1896306071,"The Real Bruce Lee serves little purpose as a documentary.  The information on Bruce Lee's start as an actor is only in the first part of the film in stead of trough out.  The remainder of film is used to show two of Bruce Lee's impersonators Bruce Li and Dragon Lee. The footage of Dragon Lee was unnecessarily long.  Show half of Dragon Lee's movie is too much, just a few clips to get the point across are enough.  I would not recommend this as a good Bruce Lee Documentary to learn from.",1361577600,,491,4.247311827956989
202307,5,1896306071,This was exactly the movie of Dragon Lee that I was looking for.  I used to watch it all the time with my brothers and cousins back in the 80's.  We had all the moves and lines memorized.  Nostalgic!!!,1229212800,,201,4.102564102564102
202308,4,1896306071,"This is a misleading movie because if you want to see Bruce Lee, as in  the real Bruce Lee, then you will for about 20 minutes before imitators ""Bruce Li"" and ""Dragon Lee"" show up. Their footage is good and entertaining, but this is meant to be exclusively about Bruce Lee, his ""real"" self.",1224806400,,290,4.37037037037037
202309,1,1896306071,"The title is misleading, the dvd cover synopsis is misleading, there is no rare footage of the REAL Bruce Lee to be found in the pic...only footage of the clones doing a poor job of exploiting the Little Dragon. A sad reminder of how Bruce's name and legacy was exploited by cold-hearted hustlers. GARBAGE!",1140393600,,306,4.685185185185185
202310,1,1896306071,"For all that is sacred and holy, do not spend money on this atrocity. I came across it because it was included in a budget-priced DVD collection that I picked up, full of old so-bad-they're-good kung fu flicks, but this item isn't even good enough for that crowd. Produced by some hack named Serafim Karalexis, this film is shameless enough to call itself ""The Real Bruce Lee"" even though it primarily features the look-alikes that movie producers trotted out after Bruce's sudden death in 1973, hoping to make money off a gullible public that was hungry for more of Bruce's incredible martial arts mastery. There were many inferior films (with equally inferior Bruce imitators) that tried to cash in, and this one is among the most brazen.

This so-called ""biopic"" starts out with a basic life story of Bruce Lee, information that is freely available anywhere, and presents excerpts from some of the Hong Kong films that Bruce appeared in as a child actor in the '40s and '50s. This material might actually be of interest to collectors and historians, but there's not much of it and the video quality is horrendous. Next, the narrator tells us about Bruce's classic films, but accompanied only by still shots of movie posters, and with no actual footage. This means that the clowns behind this biopic couldn't get the rights. And then the ultimate shamelessness commences.

The narrator tells us that Bruce was so great that he spawned many knock-offs, because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. (Bring me a shovel.) After some brief footage of various useless wooden-faced imitators, this film then concludes with 63 minutes (that's right SIXTY-THREE minutes) of action scenes starring another look-alike named Dragon Lee, a crony of Karalexis. Concerning this Dragon Lee, he had some serious martial arts skills and could have been a legitimate star in his own right. But he will be forever remembered as a shallow wannabe who got mixed up with hucksters and charlatans, often imitating the real Bruce's menacing facial expressions but coming up woefully short on Bruce's complex charisma (just like all the other look-alikes). At the end of Dragon Lee's incredibly lengthy on-screen audition, the narrator says, ""we all know there is only one Bruce Lee... his memory will live forever."" You hear this while watching an imitator, and no image of Bruce himself has been seen since the still movie posters back near the beginning of this travesty. Shameless, pathetic, unforgivable.

202311,1,1896306071,"The title is misleading.  Less than 1/3 of this 'film' is about Bruce Lee, which features films made when he was a child actor, and a paltry amount of other photos.  Then the shmucks who created this 'film' completely forget the 'real' Bruce Lee and show a wanna-be named Bruce Li whose martial arts are marginal at best.  After that debacle, we get to watch a poorly made Kung Fu movie featuring another wanna-be named 'Dragon Lee', who, whilst he may physically resemble the real Bruce, is much slower, and his style of Kung Fu rather ornate and silly which the real Bruce thought was a waste.  What's really a waste is any money spent on this fraud of a film.  The hucksters who threw it together did so withthe obvious intent of duping the public looking for a quality documentary on the one and only late Bruce Lee.  It's an insult to his legacy.  The shysters who spliced this crap together should be flogged in public.  Whatever you do, don't buy this film!",1126051200,6,964,4.5
202312,3,1896306071,"Hey,
I watched this film, it does have some good fight scenes of a Bruce Lee duplicate, but who is nothing compared to the actual legendary Bruce Lee. In the beginning, it contains like a 30 minute documentary on the Real Bruce Lee and his life, showing clips from his early childhood movies made in Hong Kong, before he came to the US. I think you can watch this film once for the sake of Bruce Lee, if you are his fan and the fight scenes are not bad, they are watchable!
But don't get your hopes too high and you probably will not be watching it often and you can make your own judgement about the duplicate Bruce Lee and his fighting from this film.",995760000,3,653,4.190476190476191
202313,2,1896306071,"I bought this DVD thinking I would get a better insight into the life of Bruce Lee. I was partially right. It has some very early footage of Bruce Lee as a child actor and even a clip where Bruce and his real father acted together. Once this part of the DVD is over though, they leave Bruce Lee all together and go on to tell us about Bruce Li and Dragon Lee (Bruce Lee wannabe actors). More than half of the DVD is about these two ""actors"". I am greatfull to see what they have about Bruce but the rest of the DVD can be thrown out. It's as though they are trying to make you believe these other two ""actors"" are as good as Bruce. The first, Bruce Li, has only moderately good martial arts skills. Not even worth watching. The second, Dragon Lee, is a bit better, his skills are good, he kind of, only kind of looks like Bruce. He also tries hard to use many of Bruce's mannerisms. Still, why would they even consider adding these two ""actors"" to the DVD? It's supposed to be ""The Real Bruce Lee"" not ""The Real Bruce Lee and Two Fakes"" !!! I gave this DVD 2 stars because they provide some rare footage of Bruce as a child. The only ""real"" Bruce worth seeing on this DVD.",992304000,26,1172,4.122270742358078
