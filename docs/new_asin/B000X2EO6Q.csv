8226754,4,B000X2EO6Q,"I've been a fan of this short OAV classic since I first watched the VHS dubbed tape at the tender age of 13. It rides on one joke (that a ""hero"" sent to rescue kidnapped beauties from the all-female kingdom of Strawberry Fields is a lech and likes to take pictures of the inevitably stripped and busty girls before releasing them, but is constantly foiled by an irate woman sent to accompany him in his quest) but at what amounts to 40 minutes of anime, it doesn't really have time to get old.

The art is fairly standard for an old anime OAV, but it works for the material. Most of the girls have their tops removed at some point. Nothing graphic below the waist and no actual sex whatsoever. VERY tame, given the rating. It's not hentai and it seems silly to promote it as such. I'd say 16+.

The price tag is a bit steep given the brevity of the material included, but I couldn't resist getting this DVD, if only for the nostalgia factor.

NOTE: THE other Dragon Knight OAV (I believe it is a follow-up), released separately from this, is typical hardcore hentai with none of the humor or charm of this one. Avoid it if you aren't fond of typical hentai.",1254268800,3,1157,4.347222222222222
8226755,2,B000X2EO6Q,"The box art and summary for this semi-obscure example of ""Hentai"" (adult's-obly) Japanese Anime promise something along the lines of a low-comedy/kinky-sex fantasy ""epic,"" but it's only going to satisfy the least discriminating fans of the genre and those who don't mind spending close to .....  or more for a VERY short excercise in surrealistic sexy-mayhem. Set in the generic Anime medieval-fantasy world, our story follows a very un-knightly knight who is drafted by an all-female kingdom to rescue several beautiful warrior-maidens and some stolen magic crystals from the tower of the evil ""Dragon Knights."" As is necessary for the genre, the aforementioned maidens are all barely dressed and ""imprisoned"" in variations on lightweight ""bondage,"" which prompts our hero to snap photographs of them sans-clothing with his polaroid camera (? ) before each rescue. The whole thing is, apparently, based on a popular adult-oriented computer game in Japan which, (if this film is any indication,) must be sort of a cross between Final Fantasy and Leisure Suit Larry. Yes, it's weird as can be and features lots of attentively-animated nudity, but in the end it's just an overly-breif, incredibly silly venture that really didn't do much for me.",969753600,6,1243,5.277777777777778
