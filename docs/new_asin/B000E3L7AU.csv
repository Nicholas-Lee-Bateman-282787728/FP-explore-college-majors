After all of my expectations after Outlaw Star, this was horrible.
Duuz and Valeria where sad counterparts to the ones from Outlaw Star.
The translation team did not work with the Outlaw Star team and translated several things were translated differently (subs and dubs, don't get me started about how bad the dub was)
The episodes end up being a escort an episode with something that they said wouldn't go wrong, goes exactly the way they say it won't and they fire their big gun and save the day.",1431388800,,631,4.495652173913044

8105297,3,B000E3L7AU,"This series had a ton of potential. They had a huge Universe already built through the Outlaw Star series, and all kinds of ways to build of the plot of that story. Unfortunately, the was almost no connection to Outlaw Star at all. All the things they could have done with this show were not done at all. They took a really good looking character (Meifon) and built a series completely on her boobs, which you only get to see once from the side. This show is really thin.

It's about Meifon Li, the 16-year-old owner of the Links corporation. Her ship and crew protect smaller merchants from space pirates. Her life is pretty fun and care free, until her past comes back to haunt her, and her grandfathers old enemy appears wanting revenge.

The series started off a total bummer and picked up toward the middle. I was really excited about it until the ending. The last 2 episodes are a major let down. As I said earlier, it was sad, but now satisfying. I recommend watching this before buying it. I can't see any fan of Outlaw Star being anything but disappointed.",1359417600,,1065,4.484536082474227
8105298,5,B000E3L7AU,"If you like outlaw star you love this,because it's in the same universe. The only difference is you get a girl version of gene starwind.",1351468800,,136,4.48
8105299,1,B000E3L7AU,"Yeah, so I got this anime a while ago, and watching it was torture. It is just bad to say the least, which is a shame. I bought it because I was a huge fan of Outlaw Star if figured that this would be decent, it's not. There is only one episode that I liked out of the whole series, it doesn't get interesting until the vary end, which I  still ended up falling asleep while watching it. I only bought it at the time because it was cheep, my recommendation is to save your money.",1321056000,2,479,3.9895833333333335

8105303,4,B000E3L7AU,"When I started watching Angel Links, I was on the verge of dismissing it as just another shoot up the enemy-of-the-day type of show. The first few eps feature Meifon and company's exploits fighting pirates, poachers, and other baddies in space... and I get to thinking, what's so special about that? Do I have to sit through the same drill every time?

Fortunately, Angel Links develops into something more. Amidst fighting pirates, Meifon is unexpectedly haunted by various visions and flashbacks of past events -- a man aiming a gun at her, her grandfather screaming, her mother shot dead, etc. and all of it seems to be tied to one name: Goryu. As the series progressed, I found myself getting more and more drawn into Meifon's tortured soul. Her grandfather had not only left her with a great fortune, but also with a legacy of vengeance and death. Meifon later discovers that she is not just his heiress, she is his assassin. She is subsequently torn between carrying out her grandfather's wishes, fighting her own inner turmoil, and living a normal life the way a normal girl her age is supposed to. Angel Links picks up considerably after its mundane start. After the real plot concerning Meifon is uncovered, the pace continues to escalate up until the climactic final battle with the elusive Goryu and the poignant conclusion.

The art and animation are spectacular for most part (I say most part because some of the in-betweening jobs aren't so great). Distinctive character designs and impressive space battle as well as melee action sequences comprise the whole series. There is also a bit of fan service, mostly close-ups of Meifon's big and bouncy boobs -- which are also the hiding place of her winged cat / weapon Taffei. Taffei flies out of Meifon's cleavage whenever she's in danger, or whenever she calls him. He can transform into a powerful sword that can slice almost anything in half.

Angel Links is a surprisingly good series. I'm glad I took the time to check it out despite the lukewarm reviews I had encountered prior to watching.",1158883200,7,2058,4.824362606232294
