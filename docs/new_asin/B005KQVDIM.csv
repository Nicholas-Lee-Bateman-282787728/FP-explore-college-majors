It's way overwrought, treacly and overacted. The storyline is weak. This is the worst of the overseas thrillers I've watched. It makes The Octopus look understated.",1422230400,,309,4.961538461538462
8477109,4,B005KQVDIM,not up to standards of montalbano or fog and crimes but still excellent entertainment,1408838400,,85,5.142857142857143
8477110,2,B005KQVDIM,"This is a soap opera disguised as a ""thriller!!!"" Had I known this is a script by the same writer as ""The Octopus,"" I would certainly have not considered purchasing it !! That too was a ""soap opera,"" - over-acted and over dramatized without any depth and an overall mindless pursuit of nothing in particular. There is the usual ""macho"" lead detective, who is pursued by (unknown to him) a love interest, (every woman falls as his feet), and described as ""the best detective in the country,"" - two detectives in the squad are husband and wife, (who discuss who should do the grocery shopping), with the wife being 5 months pregnant, but a good coffee maker, and the husband constantly eating. The crime scene investigation is totally without any attempt at authenticity - the ""forensic pathologist,"" is depicted as sexy and, it turns out, the love interest of one of the detectives. I got through a couple of episodes, waiting for improvement, but eventually put it in the cupboard to perhaps view at a later date when I am desperate for entertainment. Others may buy it, but I would certainly not waste money. I will stick with the Scandanavian/British detective mysteries/thrillers - they do not insult one's intelligence. For the most part have not been impressed by Italian productions !!",1396224000,3,1291,4.846153846153846
8477111,5,B005KQVDIM,"This is a bit over top.
But you get so attached to the actors
Very dark, not for the weak of heart.",1392508800,,99,3.5454545454545454
8477112,5,B005KQVDIM,"Its title may be uninspiring, but this series is EXCELLENT.  The characters are very well developed, and the mystery of the serial killer is riveting.  Each episode involves a separate, stand-alone crime drama (as well as personal dramas of the squad members) apart from the serial murder investigation, which comes closer and closer to being solved.  As you follow the investigations, you will learn learn about Italian art, architecture and poetry.  You will be treated to the beauty of Rome.  My one criticism is that the final episode seems to be overly drawn out.  Nevertheless, I think this is the best of the Italian crime series.  Bravo!",1378166400,3,645,4.97196261682243
