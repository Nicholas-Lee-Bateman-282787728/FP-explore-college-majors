8322798,4,B0000CG8AS,I loved these movies and the soundtrack that came with them. Mamoru Oshii is a genius but there were quite a few flaws that kept me unsatisfied. I wouldn't recommend these for everyone but only for those who like Oshii and anime. If you do it's a definate buy!,1084320000,2,260,4.326530612244898
