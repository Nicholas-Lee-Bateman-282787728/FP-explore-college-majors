8397844,5,B003J7HO7I,A eye opening account of Arab individuals and Arab rulers that refused to allow the persecution of Jews during WW2.  Thank you for an illuminating reminder of humanity in the face of cruelty.  A must see for all people who choose to unite rather than divide religions.  Kindness is a virtue shared by these poignant stories. This researcher has added much to my love for North Africa which was my home for awhile as a child.  Hopefully this documentary will find a larger audience.  My applause!,1298246400,7,495,4.709302325581396
