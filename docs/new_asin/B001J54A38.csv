8311897,5,B001J54A38,Mindless fun..Paige Campbell is indeed the real star of the show.  The hockey guy is ok too.,1451174400,,92,4.411764705882353
8311898,5,B001J54A38,This movie is excellent! Exhilerating! Especially the part where Paige Campbell was rubbing her eye. Paige Campbell was the true star and I hope she makes an appearance in the prequel. She added just the right amount of humour to an otherwise intense hockey movie.,1450310400,,264,4.888888888888889
8311899,1,B001J54A38,I like hockey and watched the trailer for this movie before I purchased it. I thought the trailer didn't look too bad. Boy was I wrong!!!! I figured it would be neat to own a movie that had a character in the movie with a similar name to my own. Thats the high light of this movie the cover art. I could not even finish this movie. Had to keep using the fast forward function. The only funny parts were of Sure Shot the hockey player. Everything else was filler. Save your money. This is a ZERO star movie.,1309132800,,506,4.121212121212121
