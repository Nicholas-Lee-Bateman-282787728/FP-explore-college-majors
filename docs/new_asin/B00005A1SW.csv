1411871,5,B00005A1SW,"As a long time fan of the Blackadder series, I feel confident to rank ""Goes Forth"" as second only to the third series.  The comedy is more visceral rather than cerebral in ""Goes Forth"", which is not necessarily a bad thing, but over time, some jokes do tend to wear as thin as the canned laughter.
The Western Front 1917 - Blackadder has been reduced to the ranks of Captain in the British Army.  Of course, he joined when it was little more than a travel agency for men with overactive libidos, and when the type of enemy favoured were peace-loving pygmies armed only with sharp fruit.  He really does not care for this soldering business anymore since everyone seems to get killed in the first fifteen seconds of battle by machine gun fire.  Yes, he's not all that keen on going over the top.  So with a cunning plan or two from his batsman Baldrick and the assistance of the quite possibly inbred Lieutenant George, each episode he desperately attempts to avoid yet another offer to have his brains blow out for Britain courtesy of General ""Insanity"" Melchett.  Naturally, hilarity ensues, with trials of treason (for shooting Melchett's own carrier pigeon, Speckled Jim), flights of fancy which turn quickly into distinctly boring situations (i.e. landing behind enemy lines), and a chance to get to know a pretty nurse are just some of the stickiest situations Blackadder finds himself in since Sticky the stick-insect got stuck on a sticky bun.
Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, and Stephen Fry all reprise their roles from previous seasons (Baldrick, George, Melchett respectively).  Tim McInnery returns once again to the series, though not as Percy, but as the equally annoying Captain Darling.  Miranda Richardson (fondly remembered as the egregious Queenie from the second series) makes a guest appearance in General Hospital, where Blackadder finally wins her heart only to have their affair end in tragically comic circumstances! Keep an eye out too for Gabrielle ""Bob"" Glaister, Adrian Edmonson, Rik Mayall, and Geoffrey Palmer who also appear in guest roles.  And if you couldn't guess by the fact his face and name are on the cover, Rowan Atkinson returns to his greatest role as that Black-something-a-rather-guy.
My only complaint about this DVD, is the distinct lack of special features - no commentary, no biographies, no interviews, no...anything actually.  Unless of course, you, like the BBC, consider scene selection a special feature, you won't find enough special features to cover a small water biscuit. Quite a shame really, as I'm sure all fans would like at least some insight into the making of the show, the writing process, rehearsals.  I can only assume that either none of the team was interested in talking about the show, or that perhaps they had no say as to the production of the DVD.
That aside, this DVD is essential viewing and purchasing for any fan of the series.  As highly recommended as a highly recommended thing that's been highly recommended.",1075507200,10,2986,4.95
1411872,5,B00005A1SW,"This is a hilairious series!  Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Laurie and Tony Robinson are great in the lead roles.  Their quirky adventures with Captain Darling and ""Walrus Face"" Melchett are wonderfully funny!  There is a bit of a weak episode when they learn to fly, but ""General Hospital"" is undoubtedly the best of the series and more than makes up for it.",1030320000,4,350,4.704918032786885
1411873,5,B00005A1SW,"The entire Black Adder series will leave you grinning for days.  The only hazardis that at any time you may find yourself suddenly bursting into unprovoked laughter when you recall one of Atkinson's lines.  If this happens during an important meeting, a romantic encounter or church, you might find yourself embarrassed",1022803200,3,319,5.235294117647059
1411874,5,B00005A1SW,"The final series 'Black Adder Goes Forth' is my favourite of all the Black Adder Series.  This is not to say the others are no good, they are fantastic.  'Black Adder Goes Forth' however, is simply supreme comedy. On my copy of the DVD there are no special features whatever, just a simple episode, scene and language group of options.  Rowan Atkinson is the undisputed star of all the series and 'Black Adder Goes Forth' is no exception.  A standout in this series, however is Stephen Fry who plays General Melchett.  The writers, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, have taken a lot of swipes at the British Army's WW1 leadership incompetence and the futility of the 'Great War'. (good job too, as millions of men died at the expense of the British Aristocracy). This is a memorable comedy series, with some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen on television.  Bravo Black Adder.",1021852800,6,878,4.6688311688311686
1411875,5,B00005A1SW,"While rumours abound about a new series of ""Black Adder"" and when it may appear, this disc should satisfy any itch you may get in the meantime. This may indeed be the superior series of the Black Adder set but you can decide for yourself. Six episodes, each a gem of comic writing and acting. Hugh Laurie's ""George"" is more well rounded than the third series while Tim McInnery's return is a welcome site. Still, credit must go to Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson for their stand-out performances.
The writing is again superb, but the real genius of the plot is the underlying message of the futility of war and the staggering waste of human life. In the final moments of episode 6, we observe the purest moment of humanity; Baldrick's wish to lay down arms and live in peace, Darling's dream of a quiet suburban life about to shatter, and George's dumbfounded realization that his lineage, education, and money won't stop the fact that he is frightened and about to die. As the picture of stoic grace, Black Adder brings the calamity to a close with the final charge over the top. As the battlefield fades, a field of red poppies bloom in tribute to the men and women of the British Armed Forces who lost their lives. It still brings tears to my eyes with each viewing. Is the other face of comedy not tragedy?
Genius.",1015286400,61,1319,4.546218487394958
1411876,5,B00005A1SW,"Loyal Blackadder fans from the previous three series get to appreciate the Blackadder crew at the height of their comedic powers.  The savage wit, tinged with tragic morbidity, mark Blackadder as a comedy that can be appreciated on a number of levels over multiple viewings.  British comedy has always had a destinctive flavour which appeals to the darker aspects of life,  this series sees that darkness raised to an art form.",1006905600,,427,4.985915492957746
1411877,5,B00005A1SW,"I highly recommend this DVD. Very entertaining with skilled actors and hilarious jokes, I found it to be the best of all Blackadder series.",991785600,,139,4.833333333333333
1411878,5,B00005A1SW,"Black Adder stars Rowan Atkinson, an absolute comic genius who is also the star of Mr. Bean.  The screenplays were written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean, Not the nine o'clock news) and Ben Elton - possibly one of the funniest modern writers.
In the forth series, Rowan Atkinson plays a cynical army captain, famous for his slaughter of peaceful pygmies using only sharpened fruit.
The six episodes in the series are:
1. Captain Cook - rather than help move General Haig's liquor cabinent six inches closer to Berlin, Black Adder tries out as the company artist
2. Corporal Punishment - a delicious plump breasted pigeon gets Black Adder a visit with a firing squad
3. Major Star - rather than try his luck with German Snipers, Black Adder tries out for vaudeville.  Things look promising until the General Melchett falls for the female impersonator
4. Private Plane - Lord Flash is back and women are falling over everywhere.  Why doesn't Flash wear underpants?  hasn't been a pair made that can handle the job.
5. General Hospital - A beautiful nurse, a patient with a strong german accent and three weeks in the hospital.  Will Black Adder ever find the Kaiser's spy?
6. Goodbyeee - the final end.  Will Edmund manage to avoid the ""big push"" with a ""wibble"" or is it curtain call",988070400,3,1279,4.713004484304933
1411879,4,B00005A1SW,"SPOILER ALERT The final series made in 1989 is a fine ending to the series. Set in the trenches of France in 1917, Captain Blackadder is waiting in his bunker for the order to go over the top and face certain death at the hands of the opposing German army. Each episode chronicles his attempts to get out of the trenches before the inevitable slaughter, such as putting on shows for the troops, joining the air corps, etc. As with most of the previous series, the last episode does not see Edmund survive, but here we have a fairly poignant anti war episode with most of the humour being nervous comedy. The funniest episode in my view is the General Hospital episode, though the airforce one is also a corker.  Hugh Laurie reappears as the proto-Wooster Lt George and Tony Robinson again dons the much for Private Baldrink, possibly the closet thing to brain dead that you can be without the need for life support. There's also General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny) ""How are we then, Darling?""  A sad final episode but a great one. Probably the last good thing Rowan Atkinson has done in his career.",984182400,8,1129,4.611940298507463

1411944,4,B00005A1SW,"""Blackadder Goes Forth"" was the fourth and final season of the sitcom starring Rowan Atkinson in the title role, and this DVD contains all six of the episodes of that season that originally aired on the BBC in the fall of 1989.

The final season is set in the trenches of World War I in 1917, and finds Captain Edmund Blackadder sardonic and brutally cynical about the war and the commanders in the British army.  George (Hugh Laurie) and Baldrick (Tony Robinson) also return for this season, and as in previous seasons Blackadder gets into (and out of) many tough spots with much humor along the way.

As in the other seasons of this show, ""Blackadder Goes Forth"" teaches lessons in history along with all of the humor--some of the period topics broached here include trenches and trench warfare, carrier pigeons, court-martials, Charlie Chaplin and variety shows, the Flying Corps, the suffragette movement, POWs, field hospitals, and espionage.  However, adults should know before showing these episodes to history-loving children that this series contains foul language and other age-inappropriate references.

Many think that the last Blackadder season was the best one, and it certainly had a poignant ending.  Those who enjoyed the other entries in this series would certainly enjoy ""Blackadder Goes Forth.""",1404172800,,1314,5.1745283018867925

1411975,5,B00005A1SW,"I love the Black Adder Series.  I have been a fan of these for decades now.  I actually have all the series on old VHS tapes.
But now, low an behold, they are on Amazon Prime, for free!!!!!
Needless to say, I NEVER drag out those old VHS tapes, not even sure if my old tape player even works.  Not that this matters anymore, for I have the best entertainment in the world, BLACK ADDER!
To watch Baldrick and Black Adder scheme, connive, and generally cause mayhem is the best.
I HIGHLY recommend this to any fan of the old BBC.  If you ever like Faulty Towers, Monty Python, etc.  You will soon be addicted to Black Adder.
So, stop whatever you are that you're doing now and sit down and watch them all.
The First Series, Black Adder is a dunce, and Baldrick this faithful servant belittles him, set in old knights and castles England.
The Second, Elizabethan England, and Black Adder is a scheming member of the court, sharp of wit, and Baldrick is a dunce of hilarious levels.
The Third, Black Adder is a conniving servant to the idiot son, and heir, of the insane King George.  Baldrick his servant, and funny as all get out.
In the Fourth, Captain Black Adder is a Captain on the western Front in WWI, and Baldrick the smelliest private in the trenches.

The cunning plans never cease, and never cease to induce laughter.

1412034,5,B00005A1SW,"Blackadder is a British comedy that follows the lives of the royal ""Blackadder"" line, a lineage that seems to produce nothing but sniveling cowards who are always trying to shirk duty and avoid all sense of obligation. Produced in four seasons, with each season taking place at a specific time in history, the series commences in season one with the life of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), a son of the English King (Brian Blessed) in the 15th century. As the seasons progress, we move forward in time until ultimately arriving in season four with a certain ""Captain Blackadder"" in the trenches in World War I. The premise of the show, then, is to watch the machinations of the current Blackadder as he squirms his way through each threatening situation while continuing his quest to wiggle ever higher up in life, whether that be to become King (as in season one) or to escape the trenches of World War I (as in season four). The show is one of the most successful comedies to ever come out of the BBC.

The character of Edmund Blackadder begins in season one as the Duke of Edinburgh (his accidental killing of Richard III over the misappropriation of a horse seems to cause him some serious difficulties about this time, with a little help from Shakespeare), and episodes revolve around Blackadder either attempting to seize control of the throne or, in the other cases, trying to keep from being executed due to his shenanigans. Without giving any of the story lines away, we can say that each season sees Blackadder incarnated in the form of one of the descendants of the Blackadder line, and so Edmund's character shows up, first in the Middle Ages, then in the Renaissance, and finally, in World War I. Over this span of some 600 years (specifically, 1485 - 1917), we see that for one to be a ""Blackadder"" carries a whole series of connotations with it, this being the underlying theme of the show in all its contorted situations and events.

Edmund Blackadder is not the only recurring character throughout the seasons. His dogsbody is Baldrick (Tony Robinson), who is also present in every episode in the entire series. Other actors (including Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Tim McInnerny) who appear as key characters in one season will frequently appear as different characters other seasons. Each of the supporting actors is outstanding, and although Blackadder is clearly Atkinson's show, all the actors work together to pull the effort off seamlessly. Many of the special characters are famous British actors and/or comedians, but it is not necessary to know that as you watch the episodes.

To a certain extent, ""Blackadder"" defies categorization as a TV show. It certainly is a comedy, and a sardonic, cynical one at that. However, the series is so vested in British history that one almost feels you are receiving a series of lessons on British history rather than just watching a comedy show. And while it is not necessary to be fully aware of the major events of British history in order to enjoy the show, it certainly helps to bring a richer enjoyment to the experience, and you also won't miss the numerous history-oriented ""asides,"" ""caricatures,"" and allusions that fill the show. The other side of the coin, so to speak, is that by watching the entire series, you can get a ""mini"" British history lesson on an almost subconscious level.

The show is indeed extremely funny, but this is a distinctively ""British"" show. If you are an American viewer and are not familiar with this type of humor, there may be a short period of adjustment, but after one or two episodes, understanding the humor becomes second-nature. True, there is much similarity in Rowan Atkinson's style of humor and the type of humor commonly seen in America, but there is certainly also that little added ""twist"" that may take typical American viewers a little time to absorb. Once you do, it is straight laughs all the way. And it is not all high-brow: there are sight gags, physical humor, and yes, even occasional crassness. This is history for people who don't take history all too seriously, and Blackadder in a way epitomizes all that we average people feel as we go through life, regardless of the historical backdrop operating during our lives.

Some viewers may be aware of Atkinson's other very famous and popular series, ""Mr. Bean."" Let's be clear and explain that there is virtually no relationship between these two shows, which have different premises, a different comedic approach, and are generally aimed at different audiences. To think that Rowan Atkinson successfully completed an engineering degree at Oxford and ended up playing Edmund Blackadder is a stretch, at best. And yet, once you see him in action, you can easily see how this came about. He is like a little kid in class, always wishing to pull the string on the person's clothes sitting next to him, or perhaps placing the proverbial whoopee cushion under the teacher's chair. In a very real way, it all seems a natural, un-acted role for him.

Blackadder season four was voted in 2000 by the British Film Institute as the 16th best British TV series in all the BBC's history. The previous three seasons are every bit as good, and it is likely that the strong political themes underpinning season four played into the rating. Let's just say that, in spite of its occasional crudity and offensiveness (yes, we may be offended at a few things here and there - the show is an equal opportunity lancet), Blackadder must be easily rated as one of the BBC's master productions. It's fun to watch, helps us learn, and perhaps even more, makes us think. But it is simply sheer comedic entertainment that begs for another season. Purchase all the seasons together in this single, remastered set. It will save you a few pounds from buying them one season at a time!",1325808000,7,5834,4.805776892430279
1412035,5,B00005A1SW,"This review is for Black Adder series 4.

In this series, Black Adder returns as a captain in the British army in the trenches during WWI. Baldrick is a private, and Hugh Laurie is back as a lieutenant, both under Black Adder's command. The guy who played Lord Percy in series 1 and 2 is back as Captain Darling, the assistant to their general, and kind of an enemy of Black Adder. Melchett from series 2 is back as this general. The woman who played Bob in series 2 is also back as Bob, here disguised as a man and driver to Melchett.

In my opinion, this is the best of all the Black Adder series. It is just hilarious.

Baldrick's ""cunning plans"" are as crazy as ever. His cuisine, making use of rats, mud and all sorts of disgusting things, are often used by Black Adder to get back at Darling. How they made up Baldrick to look that dirty all the time is beyond me.

Hugh Laurie's character is from the British upper class and forever jolly in an idiotic sort of way - much like the Prince character he played in series 3. In one episode, he is in a show in drag, and the Melchett thinks he really is a woman and falls for him. This should not be missed. Baldrick's attempt at drag here is really good too.

But the best character is Black Adder. He tries in all sorts of ways to get out of the trenches and to a safe place. Sort of like Lucille Ball trying to get into the show in I Love Lucy - really creative, always unsuccessful, but hilarious. In the final episode, Black Adder's plan involves wearing a pair of underwear on his head, sticking pencils up his nose and saying all sorts of nonsense. You have to see this to fully appreciate it - it is beyond funny.

As in all the other series, this one ends on a sad note. Despite all his efforts, Black Adder cannot get out of actually going ""over the top"" into ""no man's land"" to confront the Germans. He leads the charge accompanied by Baldrick, Hugh Laurie's character AND Darling. There is more, but I don't want to spoil it for people who have not seen it; it is sad, but well done at the same time.

The series is very funny - witty, slightly sarcastic, very British. As has been said by many others, the series does make a statement on the pointlessness of WWI and to some extent war generally, while still remaining funny.

Highly recommended!!!",1295136000,2,2313,4.276887871853547

The Tudor event was terrific. The Georgian one seemed impossible to equal the Tudor but to me, it did. However, I waited many, many years before bringing myself to countenance humour from the Great War. Finally I did. I rest my review on one word; 'superb'! The humour is delicate, sublime, sympathetic and ultimately, poignant! Anyone who has a nervous disposition concerning the notion of humour about 'the war to end all wars' should overcome that thought on this occasion.",1284854400,2,639,4.871559633027523

My  favorite line is when Blackadder is given access to the ""secret"" plans and he tells the General, you know we've done this same maneuver 17 times in a row. Of course, Melcher quickly responds by pointing out that the enemy will never expect the same action 18 times in a row and so it will be a surprise, of course!

At this point in the Blackadder saga, all the wonderful characters have been fully established.  Thus, the writers can exploit their hilarious faults to the fullest.  Each episode is fiercely funny, and when I say that I have in mind the very dark humor of the Great War setting.  Every story has something to do with the immediate threat of death in battle, which makes for a very interesting take on the alternating hysteria and doldrums that was life in the trenches.

Highly recommended, with a what-ho and pip pip!",1241913600,,712,4.648

1412052,5,B00005A1SW,"It's funny how different people have different impressions of the same show. I adore Black Adder 2 and 3 because they have a historical basis but are side-splittingly funny with amazing dialogue. I enjoy Black Adder 4 - but it's tempered because there is an extremely strong anti-war message which makes the entire show almost depressing.

This show is set in World War 1, and Black Adder is now a man trying desperately NOT to go over the wall of his bunker and be slain by the Germans. Hugh Laurie from House is at his side as the clueless George, and Baldrick is there as always as his trusty but dimwitted servant.

Really, the primary jist of this entire show is that Black Adder's clueless superiors keep trying to get him to go die in battle, and Black Adder wants to stay alive. There are other momentary diversions - putting on a play, doing a painting, but wanting to stay alive is the key aim.

I love the dialogue as always. I love the characters and how they integrate so many tiny bits of history which make the scenes that much more fun. It's sort of like watching M*A*S*H. It is funny, but there is the heavy influence of death and depression there that press in on it.

While I did watch this DVD once and enjoyed it, it's seasons 2 and 3 that I rewatch numerous times when I want to have fun and enjoy myself. Depending on your personality, you might either feel the same way or really treasure 4 for its real-earth grounding.

Well recommended.",1230336000,2,1463,4.4440298507462686
1412053,5,B00005A1SW,"I originally caught perhaps half of the shows on the tube and snatched up a 'complete set' as soon as it was released years ago. I never tire of watching it. Some people may not have caught it, but the fortunes of the Blackadder family was on a steady downhill slide over the centuries... from a prince, to a lord, to a man-servent, to a captain in the trenches of WWI. Goes Forth is my favorite series. Having served in the American military, I can really appreciate the military absurdities depicted in the show.",1221696000,2,514,4.4787234042553195
1412054,4,B00005A1SW,"Having been exposed to this series out of order (III, II, ""I,"" Goes Forth) it is easy for me to see the progression of writing, how particular jokes recur, why the 1st season didn't work so well and why the subsequent seasons did.

This is season 4, and the formula put forth in season 2 and polished in season 3 becomes a bit clunky here.  The jokes seem, in turn, homages to the previous seasons and obligatory, throw-away material.  But all in all, it works.  Laughs abound, especially when Gen. Melchett bustles on screen and complicates Capt. Blackadder's plans to put off any actual life-threatening soldiering.

New to the series in this season is Capt. Darling.  The snarky cattiness between the two Captains is comedy gold.

A ""must have"" for Rowan Atkinson fans.  A surprise for those who didn't know Hugh Laurie before ""House.""  If you don't know Stephen Fry, do yourself the favor of becoming familiar with his canon.  This is a good place to start.  And Lord Flasheart!  The coolest, larger than life jerk in historical fiction to grace the small screen.

And then there's the conclusion.  I don't want to spoil the moment, but it was a beautiful example of how comedy can truly succeed at being powerfully eloquent.",1220832000,,1229,4.735849056603773

1412057,5,B00005A1SW,I caught an episode of this on PBS and was so hooked that I had to buy the DVD right away. The writing is top notch and every character is played to perfection. What struck me most is that all these hilarious dialogs and situations are against the backdrop of war and after you see Black Adder lead the final charge to their inevitable deaths in the last scene you can't help but feeling how futile and absurd war can be. When comedy makes you laugh and cry and think it is at its best and this is the best.,1198195200,3,507,4.08

1412069,5,B00005A1SW,"The 4th series of Blackadder is one of the greatest TV comedy series of all time. The acting and writing is incredibly good. Balance this with the fabulously moving ending to the last episode, which was so unexpected at the time, and you have the perfect TV show.

Stephen Fry's performance is my favourite, but nobody has ever delivered lines like Rowan Atkinson does. Seeing one of the production team interviewed once he likened Rowan Atkinsons delivery to singing, and I think this is a valid comparison.

To pick out any one person is unfair as all the performances are excellent and the show wouldn't have been as good with a different cast. Like most of the greatest TV comedies (Fawlty Towers, Dads Army etc) somehow fate delivered the perfect cast for this show, and we should all be grateful.

It really captures the boredom and stupidity of the WWI, which really was a complete waste of time, or as Blackadder put it, ""it's so our General can move his drinks cabinet a few miles closer to Berlin"".  All of the performances here are up to their usual high standard, but I must make mention of the final episode of this series, which has to be one of the most poetic, moving, and sad endings to a comedy that I've ever seen.  I didn't expect it at all, and it ended up working so brilliantly.  And, yes, that's Hugh Laurie from House in this series (and in the 3rd one).  He was a very well known comic actor in the U.K. before he played House.  A great series, with an incredibly moving ending.",1180742400,,878,4.159763313609467
1412071,3,B00005A1SW,"""Goes Forth"" is great, and all the best things said in the other reviews apply. However, on DVD the laugh track is too loud, especially in episode one, where it really interferes. There are two areas in the extra features section which are ""buggy"": the narration in the Historical References as well as Cast Information cuts off halfway through the narration in each and every item or cast member except the 2 or 3 that are under 10 seconds long. $&@# annoying!",1176076800,,461,4.634146341463414

1412073,5,B00005A1SW,"Black Adder IV is one of the greatest comedies ever shown on television. Blackadder and sidekick Baldrick are in the trenches of World War I with the dimwitted aristocrat George as Blackadder makes every effort to avoid getting shot through the nonsensical orders of General Melchett and Captain Darling, often causing many side-splitting shenanigans in the process.

As with Black Adder's II and III, Rowan Aktinson is brilliant as the crafty and conniving Blackadder and Tony Robinson is equally so as dim-witted Baldrick. But like any good series, much hinges on the outstanding supporting cast. Hugh Laurie's twit Lieutenant George is hysterical. Stephen Fry is perfect as the hopelessly out of touch (and out of brains) General Melchett, as is Tim McInnery desk-jockey Captain Darling.

What makes Black Adder IV so excellent that it contains a very powerful anti-war message with Blackadder often being very critical in a modern satirical sense of the war and the inept strategies and tactics being used to wage it. In fact, it would not be much of a stretch to see the similarities between Black Adder IV and the war in Iraq.

It has been said that Aktinson and Robinson are interested in reprising their roles as Blackadder and Baldrick (such as they did for the millennium special). One can only hope that this bears fruit and the rest of the gang could get on board (it would be great to see Laurie reprise his role as the terminally witless aristocrat George, though it would be equally great to see Blackadder and Baldrick catch some aliment and get tormented by a visiting Dr. House).",1166313600,2,1597,4.907407407407407
1412074,5,B00005A1SW,"Full of great jokes and all the characters are memorable and outstanding. It's my favorite of the series, possibly favorite of any comedy series. And after all the jokes and sarcasm, there is this amazing scene at the very end that gives me goosebumps because it's so beautiful and really makes you feel the tragedy of war and the loss of lives.

1412075,5,B00005A1SW,"In my opinion, Blackadder IV is the best of the series.  All the others are good or near great.  This one IS great.

1412076,4,B00005A1SW,"Old slackbladder's back and this time he's up to his ears in mudd and cat's vomit. This is the true final outing for Blackadder and co and is without a doubt the best series of the lot. Stephan Fry is brilliant as Genral ""Insanity"" Melchet and Tony Robinson as Baldrick is at his usual moronic best.

Episode list:

'Captain Cook': Genral Melchett is looking for an artist to go out into no-mans land and paint the germans and guess who got to do it.

'Corporal Punishment': After Edmund eats Genral Melchets beloved pet pigeon he is court-martialed and put in front of the firing squad. Can Baldrick and George save the captain?

'Major Star': To keep the mens morale up, Genral Melchet tells Captain Blackadder to organize a show to entertain the troops.

'Private Plane': Blackadder, Baldrick and George join the Royal Flying Corp only to crash their plane behind enemy line, but don't worry Lord Flashheart will save the day.

'General Hospital': Blackadder is assigned to a hospital to find a german spy.

'Goodbyeee': It's time for the big push and Captain Blackadder is not to keen on going over the top. Can Baldrick come up with a cunning plan before it's to late?

This is pure comic gold, every episode as good as the last. The only dissapointment is the complete lack of extras on the DVD. It would have been great to have had an audio commentary with Ben Elton and co. This DVD is still worth buying for the series alone however.",1140566400,4,1442,4.60546875
1412077,4,B00005A1SW,"Lets face it, if you know the Black Adder Series you know that this series is:

1) Funny, witty and most of the times outlandish.

2) Full of satire and ribbing the status quo of a period of time.

3) The perfect setting for Rowan and company to do their best work.

This series is solid though I will say my least favorite of the 4. Some of the jokes have already been done, but the crew manage to keep the deliveries fresh and the characters true to form.

If you're a fan of the series by all means scoop it up.. BUT BEWARE!

The laugh track is horrible. It starts at the end of the joke and abruptly stops at the beginning of the next sentence. It is loud as heck and super annoying. I wish they had put it on a separate track that I could turn off because if you notice it (and you'll notice it) it really detracts from the enjoyment.",1110844800,7,839,4.054545454545455
1412078,5,B00005A1SW,"""Black Adder IV: Black Adder goes forth"" is the best of the British comedy that takes satirical swipes at various epochs of history; Medieval (I), Elizabethan (II), Georgian/Regency (III), and finally, in this fourth series, World War I. In each series stars Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson, in what is possibly his best performance), who is sharp of intellect, corrupt and conniving. In each ""resurrection"" through these ages, he is accompanied by the dimwitted Baldrick (Tony Robinson).

While the first series is weak, the ensuing three are excellent, and the fourth is my particular favorite. Accompanied by his incompetent subordinates, the eternal Baldrick and the good-natured and stupid, although surprisingly talented George (Hugh Laurie), Blackadder spends most of his time attempting to evade going out into the field against the Germans (as it meant certain death). Thwarting Blackadder's goal are the loud, dimwitted General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and his ""office boy"", the waffly Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny), who is Blackadder's enemy. The anti-war message in this particular series is clear and poignant, exposing the futility and inefficiency of the first world war.

The series is absolutely hilarious, and each episode is excellent. Rowan Atkinson is stellar as always, but I particularly enjoyed the performance of Hugh Laurie as George. The actor is most-often cited for his performance as the prince regent in Blackadder III, but in my opinion his George in Blackadder IV is his best moments. His bumbling character, a foolish young man related to the aristocracy who clearly could not profit from attending even the best schools in Britain, is both amusing and endearing, with many little touches (such as his talents in painting and acting) which lend him more depth and personality than the prince regent character. Also of special note is Tim McInnerny's performance as the nervous, semi-neurotic Captain Darling. The ongoing hostility and verbal bickering between him and Blackadder provide for many amusing moments, and his incompetence and frustrated attempts to get the upper hand on Blackadder ultimately results in an odd sort of sympathy for him. One senses that his life never amounts to more than the dry, petty details of his officework, and like the rest of the characters he appears to be somehow trapped and powerless against a monstrous, inescapable situation greater than himself. Finally, for the persons familiar with the second series (Elizabethan era), there is the gratifying return of ""Bob"" and the indomitable Captain Flasheart, in a longer and even funnier appearance than his role in the second series.

In summary: Highly recommended series- A+",1087084800,46,2700,5.363207547169812
