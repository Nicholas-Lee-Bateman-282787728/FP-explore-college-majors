8333796,3,B001PMICDO,"No problem with the DVD itself or the content on the DVD.  However, when I opened the package, the plastic broke into a million pieces like it was 40 year-old plastic.  Again, DVD is fine, but plastic case self-destructed",1375056000,,221,4.641025641025641
8333797,5,B001PMICDO,"This is one of my favorite sports DVD to watch.  I sure loved reliving that season including Tebow's promise which was so cool. The DVD showed some cool profiles on the players, the top plays on offense, defense special teams. It was so cool they won the championship after Tebow made that promise.  I recommend this DVD for diehard Gator fans.",1346889600,,344,4.622950819672131
