8105242,2,B000E3LGSI,"Kibakichi, the werewolf swordsman and defender of the Yokai monsters, returns to battle a powerful new foe in KIBAKICHI 2! After arriving in another small village on his journey through feudal Japan, a young blind woman pleas for revenge against a ravaging warrior that has been terrorizing the countryside. Kibakichi sets out to destroy the villain, but he is headed off by a mysterious woman from his past that is also out for revenge. The comic book action and violence continues at a faster pace in Tomo'o Haraguchi's bloody sequel, which clearly aims to outdo the first film. Unfortunately, it is riddled with many of the same problems that were carried over from before. Each of the characters are poorly drawn from tired old cliches, and the exaggerated performances give the film a cartoony look and feel. The weak costume designs and third-rate fight choreography only further expose the cheapness of the overall production. KIBAKICHI 2 does create a few atmospheric moments in its highly stylized sets, and Chanbara fans will certainly appreciate the increase in fighting, but the entire film is just one big, bloody monster mess that makes THE GUYVER look like Shakespeare.

I find this movie and the first, but this one more, achingly beautiful.

ps. (ok, since 0 of 2 people found this helpful so far and i'm trying to coax people into at least watching this film, i'll say this: these movies are high fairy tales, horror, love and mythology all in one. If you like samurai stories, or the works of REH, i'm pretty sure you'll love it...)
