8058886,4,B0009AK6F0,"All in all, a good video production that explains that great Canadian prairie phenomena known as ""Rider Pride"". The Saskatchewan Roughriders are the CFL's version of the Green Bay Packers, that is to say, a small town (and province) that rabidly supports a Big League sports franchise. Some might question whether or not the Canadian Football League is a major league entity; I contend that it is in that the game is unique and has country wide support; just because there are no American teams does not relegate it to minor league status. The video points out that the team has support all over Canada. Often when one goes to a BC Lions game when Regina is in town, there are more Green Rider fans in the stands than there are Lions fans. The same holds true in Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, etc. One wonders what the population of Saskatchewan might be if all these people hadn't left the province !!
Note however, that is an older production, there should be an update to include the last few seasons, including the Riders Grey Cup victory in 2007.",1234051200,,1059,4.668449197860962

call it today started in 1909, the yr.

of the first Grey Cup, with Football-

Rugby teams in both West and East. The

West didn't compete for the Grey Cup

until 1921, when the Edmonton Elks took

a train to Toronto to square off versus

the Toronto Argonauts. The Regina Rough-

riders are of course the (since 1947)

the Saskatchewan Roughriders. They have

been in 16 Grey Cups and won 2 (1966 &

1989). This video includes interviews with

Roughrider greats like Roger Aldag, Ron

Lancaster, Eagle Keys, former Coach and

the pride of (get this!;)Turkey Neck Bend,

KY, like the New York Giants Phil Simms!

Outstanding in either VHS or DVD, which

has menu and more clips. Pick up on It!",1147219200,,733,4.6015625
