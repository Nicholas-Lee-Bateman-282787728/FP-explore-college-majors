8650535,5,B00JFG6EOG,"My kids started with the CD when they were about a year old, and now at age 2 and 4 are really enjoying the DVD! We played the CD during lunch times because the music is so fun and upbeat. We regularly watch the DVD in the car and the kids love it. My 4 yr old son was just counting to 10 in Spanish on his own today!

The songs are catchy and are all about things you do every day so the language being learned is useful and can be practiced. The DVD shows other kids dancing and having fun with the music, as well as cartoons, and helps kids understand what the songs are about. There are 4 ""chapters"", divided up into different rooms in the house so all the songs in that chapter relate to the kitchen (set the table, I am hungry/thirsty, etc.), for example. Or the bathroom (brush your teeth, wash your hands). There are also several 'oldies but goodies' - songs kids know, like Itsy Bitsy Spider and Mr. Sun that are in Spanish. One of my favorites is a really nice lullaby, which even relaxes me! Catchy tunes that teach useful words and phrases. All in all a great way to expose your kids to Spanish (and keep my language abilities fresh too :).",1410739200,,1152,4.1891891891891895

8650537,5,B00JFG6EOG,"This DVD is terrific for introducing and / or reinforcing Spanish!  A kid filled music video accompanies the songs which makes it lively and entertaining. As a teacher using the Sing A Lingo cd to add fun and music to my Spanish preschool classes, the DVD helps to identify the best movements to go along with the music as well as provide simple and fun skits that introduce vocabulary and simple dialogues. Each song is related to an area of the house and everyday activities.  This helps to make learning Spanish relevant and ""sticky.""  After I listen to the catchy songs, I am singing them all day long!",1408579200,,606,4.592592592592593
8650538,5,B00JFG6EOG,"The En Mi Casa DVD is awesome! As an early childhood educator with a successful, long term home childcare program, I often look for ways to incorporate learning and fun into our day. This DVD is a great addition to our program! It is fun, interactive, and engaging for the children of all ages! The video is wonderful, with songs you just can't stop singing all day! We have watched this video everyday since it arrived, the kids keep asking for more! I find myself singing the songs throughout the day, and the kids love it! I am so glad I found this DVD, I can't wait for the next volume to come out!",1408060800,,602,4.2894736842105265
8650539,4,B00JFG6EOG,"I have purchased the CD and I loved it! Most of the songs were great and my 2-year-old loves to dance and jump to them. I've taught her some basic motions that I made up, just acting out what the songs say (wash your hands, jump, etc.) and she loves dancing to them with me. I also used some of the songs when teaching a couple of 8-year-olds some Spanish and they loved them too- they would ask for them- so it has a wide age-range.  They are not boring at all to listen to- enough repetition for young kids but not so much to get annoying, and there are various musical instruments and vocal harmonies throughout. So I am super excited to see this video! I was really hoping they would make one.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that some of the songs have words in them that are accented on the wrong syllable (RE-fri-ge-ra-dor instead of re-fri-ge-ra-DOR and a few other examples). The Spanish accent in general is good but not great (the T's are rather hard like English, not soft like Spanish). I don't think these few small examples are enough to take away from the overall greatness and fun of the whole thing though

I confess that I haven't bought the DVD version yet (or seen it) but I'm sure it's great since the songs are so good. I am planning on buying it soon for my daughter to reinforce and supplement the Spanish that I speak to her, since she learns so well from watching videos that she likes. This will also help me use the CD more- if she sees what things are from the DVD, she will know what they are saying when we listen to the CD in the car when I can't act it out with her (at least not as much *wink*).",1407801600,,1642,4.173501577287066
