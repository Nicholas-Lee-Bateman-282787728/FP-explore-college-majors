8596509,5,B002YJ45CO,"I went through Foreign Legion boot camp with Nick and have followed his career since 1989 when we both completed our contract.  Nick is without a doubt one of the most effective combat instructors that I have ever known and his ability to teach what he knows is exceptional. I have reviewed many 'combat' DVD's and shudder at some of the stuff that some self styled 'experts' pedal.  Nick is the real deal.  My son survived a multiple attack on the street from armed muggers using Nicks techniques.  If you are serious and want to learn from the best, this DVD series is the next best thing to training with Nick in person",1273190400,4,622,4.477876106194691
8596510,5,B002YJ45CO,"Nick Hughes hit one out of the park with this DVD series. He covers the practical application of combat and drills to develop the skills learned.

Nick served as a member of the FFL and was an instructor for the Legion as well. Nick's many years in the martial arts are obvious as he takes easily learned, high percentage techniques and teaches how to develop them thru drilling and practical application.

This series covers a variety of situations from empty hand, blade, firearms, multiple attackers... Great variety and great instruction without the fluff. Nick's presentation skills were great, and he does a great job explaining the how and the why to what he teaches...

If you only can afford one set of DVD's this year I highly recommend you get these. Overall rating 5 stars all the way. Thanks Nick for this great series & I look forward to your next project.",1259971200,5,870,4.7105263157894735
8596511,5,B002YJ45CO,"I am a martial arts/combatives trainer in the Texas area, as well as a police officer in the North Texas area.  I have been involved in the arts for over 25 years and have collected and viewed many, many hundreds of DVDs over the years.

Some of the DVDs offer a few pointers here and there that are useful to me while the overwhelming majority are junk and poorly done with the instructor having NO presentation skills and/or the material nothing beyond the fundamentals.  Not so with these DVDs.

Nick Hughes is the real deal.  Not only did he serve in the Legion but was an instructor as well.  In addition, Nick also worked as an international bodyguard for several years. But what really makes this series worth the price is the quality of instruction.  As an instructor myself, I seek out those individuals who not only can perform excellent material, but can TEACH.  Nick certainly meets these criterion.

Not only does he offer excellent tactics, but his delivery of the information is sublime.  He offers effective solutions and training ideas that are devoid of any martial arts hierarchy mumbo-jumbo.  Nick speaks clearly and precisely and gives reasons from his experience and vast knowledge.

My favorite DVD of the whole series, without a doubt, is his Multiple Fighter DVD.  I have collection of these DVDs from over the years and there are none like Nick Hughes'.  I regularly review this DVD as he gives some of the most effective and common sense solutions to this dangerous situation, from his own personal experience.

In short, I cannot recommend Nick Hughes' French Foreign Legion DVDs highly enough.  They worth every penny and anyone who purchases them will find them a gold mine of information and a great addition to their skills.",1259366400,6,1756,4.822742474916388
