1357680,5,B00004VVMZ,"If you love ballroom and tap dancing and haven't seen this movie, you really must.  This is the movie with the famous Fred Astaire dancing on the walls and ceilings scene.  Also him dancing with a hat rack and various other props.  And on an ocean liner in a storm.  Pretty much all the dances have something very unusual and creative about them.  There is one spot the movie seems to drag a little, but all the rest is a fun, fun, fun experience.",1500249600,,447,4.273809523809524

1357699,4,B00004VVMZ,"This is a cute movie but it's only known for one scene for good reason. It's a throw away musical that was pumped out when musicals were the thing to make.

1357725,5,B00004VVMZ,Fred Astaire is at his best work in this movie. The artistry and choreography is outstanding. The camera angles throughout the movie is fascinating and surprising.

1357786,5,B00004VVMZ,"Astaire and Powell have great chemistry on screen as brother and sister, and they play off each other so well. You'd think they really were actually related with their little inside jokes and jabs. Peter Lawford is a nice addition to the cast and a beautiful piece of eye candy...I wish he'd gotten more screen time. ;) Nonetheless, this movie still satisfies. The jokes are slightly subtle but hilarious, the songs are entertaining and memorable, the dancing is superb (Astaire's famous gravity-defying dance in the hotel room is amazingly well-done and innovative), and the romance is fast and fun. This is a Hollywood gem that should not be missed!",1465948800,,651,4.981651376146789

1357790,5,B00004VVMZ,"I am a great fan of Fred Astaire, and I was surprised and delighted to find this film which I had never seen before! I particularly loved the hysterical ""How Could You Believe Me When I Told You I Loved You When I've Been A Liar All My Life"" duet with Jane Powell. (I discovered the movie when I saw Jane Powell in a ""Murder She Wrote"" episode and did an IMDB search on her! Oh the gems you can find when you follow the bread crumbs!) The movie also includes the incredible song and dance number ""She's All the World To Me"" where Fred Astaire dances all around the room including the ceiling and the walls! What incredible artistry! The story line is typical light fare, and I didn't care too much for Jane Powell's soppy ballads which are way too soprano vibrato for my taste. But her acting was a lot of fun, as was Astaire's and you are happy to ignore the significant age difference between the actors posing as siblings (Astaire's 52 to Powell's 22) It's Astaire, so who cares? Right? So if you love fun song and dance movies of the old Hollywood kind, then you will enjoy this one as well!",1464652800,,1095,4.294685990338165

Watch him dance on a tilting cruise ship, while fruit rolls merrily underfoot! The staging, especially of the dancing-on-the-ceiling scene, is nothing short of miraculous. I could do without some of the singing, and I failed to see the attraction of the English woman Astaire falls for, but overall, this is topnotch entertainment.",1461715200,,438,5.183098591549296

It's only called A Royal Wedding because A Royal Wedding is taking place at the time in England.  Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are delightful but Jane Powell's vibrato is almost uncontrollable is some numbers.  You almost cannot understand what she is singing.  The actress Fred's character falls in love with is a mediocre dancer, she does not releve' enough or point her toes well.  Jane's love interest is handsome but that's about it.  What makes the show are the dance numbers between Fred Astaire and Jane Powell they perform as stage numbers. What is funny is the wa they try to talk themselves out of being in love.

I honestly didn't have high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The song and dance numbers are thoroughly entertaining.  I marvel at the talent of the two actors, who are true ""triple threats"" (act, sing, dance).  My kids loved watching the dance numbers in ""Singing in the Rain"" and were no less entertained by the musical numbers in ""Royal Wedding.""  My favorite scene is the humorous song toward the middle of the movie--they stay in character so well!  And they give new meaning to the phrase ""walk and chew gum at the same time.""  It's just fun to watch.  Now, the romances in the movie develop with such lightening speed to be cheesy and unrealistic, but that is par for the course with this genre of movie, or any musical for that matter.

The numbers are great and include Fred Astaire dancing up the walls and across the ceiling to ""You're All the World to Me"" (reworked by Lerner & Lane from a number called ""Minstrel Man"" in the great Eddie Cantor musical ""Kid Millions"" from the '30s), a legendary moment.

The faces are often 1 dimensional without any detail. Cuts between scenes are poorly done, and there are actual scratches in the film when the credits roll.

The romances in this film are minor compared to the dance numbers, a couple of which are classics.  It is fun to see news footage of Queen Elizabeth's wedding procession cut into this film.

Weak book / story to start with.a show-within a show first scene with Powell- Astaire as a romantic duo, but are a brother and sister act.  Jane Powell looks more what we say now is arm candy, yes sometimes in Astaire's arms in the picture during on-stage duo routines.  Please, no.

Would a vaudevillian brother and sister act really have been out there like this?  As many other reviewers also feel, the best parts are Astaire dancing solo.  Using glamorous foreign travel, royalty, conservative /old-fashioned romances and a bankable star or two, I believe was to sell a topically-influenced product before it's expiration date.  Too bad the they; the world had no clue a coronation was to happen soon enough. Nor any about rock and roll and new teen culture.  Wouldn't  they have re-written? The plot devices are awkward [to me];  represent the movie being a rocky transitional film of older pre WW2 musical-comedy-romances and later 50s on, while the form was still viable and in vogue. Not as sophisticated, funny or risque as many of the older films,  not a widescreen extravaganza as to come nor attempts at being  relevant (a path to West Side Story!)..  Thank you Fred Astaire.

in their performances. They are enjoying themselves and so do you. Of course
romance enters into their lives.  An enjoyable film, good cast.  A good time.
The Belle of New York is also enjoyable. Vera Ellen once again proves her
extrodinary dancing skills. Fred Astair and Vera Ellen are fascinating to watch.

One of the most famous scenes in the history of Hollywood is here, when Fred Astaire dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel suite. An amazing, ""how did they do that?"" moment.
But what ruins this movie is the God awful DVD transfer. This was a TECHNICOLOR movie when it was released in 1951. To look at it on this DVD you would never know it. The colours are faded, unnatural,and hard to look at. The audio is passable but muted. A real disappointment.
I didn't realise ROYAL WEDDING was in the public domain.  This means anyone with access to a film print and movie projector can offer a DVD. I thought I was buying a MGM studio issue when the reality was otherwise. This print is either a 16mm duplicate or a worn out theatre print.

1358701,3,B00004VVMZ,"This release by MGM of two early /50s films starring THE legendary man of dance Fred Astaire,offers up his two successively made projects;one good the other not so good. However both are in brilliant technicolour and quite pleasing to the eye.
Royal Wedding(released in Mar/51)stars Fred as Tom Bowen and Jane Powell as his sister Ellen. They are a popular sister and brother act with the sister being kind of a male magnet. When the two get a chance to take their show to the London stage,they jump at it. While in London Ellen succumbs to a little too much male extra circular actvitiy with an English Lord Brindale(Peter Lawford);much to the chagrin of her brother. However the love bug eventually strikes Tom too and he falls hard for one Miss Ashmond(Sarah Churchill).Their act is a smash on the London stage while the course of true love doesn't necessarily run smooth for either. When the day of the real Royal Wedding of the now Queen of England comes around Tom and Ellen,who are by now pretty much set to marry their love interests,decide it would be foolish to break up the act for marriage. They vow to remain single but when the royal couple leave the church they break down and both go running after their respective mates. The film ends with a pull-back shot of the now married foursome leaving the church.
Those that know anything about Astaire will immediately see how this film is loosely based on his own career with his first and best partner,his sister Adele. Adele fell for an Englsih Lord that inevitably broke up the act in the early /30s. Royal Wedding I would give about 3 1/2 stars;a good picture but certainly not one of Astaires best. However there are more than enough moments in this film for him to shine,and shine he does. In the ""Sunday Jumps"" number he is impatiently waiting for his sister to show up for rehearsal. He plays around with a few steps,looks at his watch and looks out the door,grabbing a hat rack by his right hand. As he turns back in he is still holding the hat rack and suddenly he is using it as his dance partner. The room he is in is supposed to be a gym room so he uses many other props that he finds but the hat rack is certainly the most used,inventive and entertaining of them all. The other number which has become legend in itself is the ""You're all the world to me"" routine. He is nuts over Miss Ashmond and while sitting looking at her picture decides to get up and dance. He dances to and fro and just when you think there's nothing more he can do he starts climbing the walls. This wonderful routine takes him in a visual circle up one wall,onto the ceiling and down the other wall and back briefly to each. The number has always managed to retain that ""wow"" factor,even today. Powell and Astaire also manage to pull off a pretty good routine together in an against-type number called ""How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Love You,when You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life"" .Watch for Albert Sharpe as Miss Ashmond's father,better known in later years as Darby O'Gill from the movie ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"".Technically the movie has been transferred beautifully and it has never looked as gorgeous as it does now. Special features include a special from TCM's Private Screenings with Stanley Donen,a featurette,an actual outtake from the movie(rare),a couple of period cartoons,the trailer and a promotional interview on radio with Astaire and Powell.
Belle of New York(released Feb/52) is a pretentious and uninteresting movie that,if it didn't have Astaire in it,wouldn't be worth the film it was shot on. The film opens with a shot of an entire street filled with male admirers singing ""When I'm out with the Belle of New York"" to Angela(Vera Ellen).She is a member of the ""Daughters of Right"",a Salvation Army type group of women led by Lettie(Marjorie Main).In comes playboy extraordinare Charles Hill(Astaire) who is supposedly on his last night of bachelorhood asking a bevy of his old girlfriends(musically)who will give him his last kiss. He leaves his intended bride standing at the altar and next day while on a buggy ride with a new female friend through the park he spots Angela and the rest of the ""Daughters"" out spreading the ""word"" to the homeless and downtrodden. Charles leaves the buggy and his girl and becomes immediately smitten with Angela. She is a tough nut to crack but over time he manages to get into her good books and the two become an item. Trouble is Charles' Aunt is Lettie,the very same Lettie who leads the ""Daughters"",of which Angela is a part of and she doesn't approve of the two at first. Lettie eventually relents and gives her blessing. Comes their wedding day and Charles gets two sheets to the wind and stands up Angela at the church. She is heartbroken and returns to the ""Daughters"" to work but  a sorry Charles still pursues her. In the end he gets his girl as the two go off into the sunset dancing on air. And the latter is what is possibly the biggest let down to the movie. Everytime we see Charles or Angela in a deep love thought they start to actually float in the air. Astaire has a number dancing on the top of the monument in Washington Square but it just does not come off. It is far too fantastical and is very much out of place. When Charles first confronts Angela about his feelings he is in the air talking to her. She looks up and tells him he's not supposed to be there and that he is silly. He floats back down. Silly it is,which ever way you look at it. The plot,what it is,is also another of the films own worst enemies. From the get go Angela is the local ""babe"",admired by seemingly every man in NYC.Vera Ellen's persona and looks go against that sentiment right away so we have a conflict throughout and since everything hinges on the audience believing it,that aspect never is pulled off with success. Also working against the grain is Vera Ellen herself. In my opinion she is one of Astaires worst partners as far as chemistry goes;the worst being Joan Fontaine in ""Damsel in Distress""(1937).And her work with Astaire in ""The Brides Wedding Day Song"" with various Currier and Ives backdrops,is pedestrian at best;the entire number is somewhat of a let down anyways. Astaires best moment comes in a kind of biographical number called""I wanna be a Dancin Man"".It's a beautiful island in a sea of mediocrity. Besides Astaire the only other presence worth noting here is Marjorie Main. She is in fine form as gruff Aunt Lettie and was always a delight to see and a solid supporting actor. This film was a box office failure in its initial run and I would give it no more than 2 1/2 stars today.
Technically the film has been wonderfully restored picture wise;both it and Royal Wedding are on a par that way. However sound wise there is a problem. During the first hour of the film the musical numbers sound like someone is playing with the pitch controls as the sound is quite erratic. For those who remember what a record is,it is like putting the needle down and watching it go from side to side(not run true).That is the type of sound you hear here and it is certainly distracting to say the least,and all the more strange they would release the film like that. Special features include a Pete Short specialty film(always a delight),a Tex Avery Cartoon,the trailer and another rare piece of footage,the alternate version of ""I wanna be a Dancin' Man"" routine. You see Astaire with and without overdubbing;a fantastic piece of footage.
Royal Wedding easily wins top spot in this double Astaire release,but while""Belles"" is just simply a poor film ""Royal"" comes in not much better than above average;so there is no reason for fireworks with either film.""Belles"" suffers from a contrite and forced story line to which there is no believability in or sympathy from the audience. Vera Ellen is a poor partner for Astaire but Fred at least has one good solo spot.""Royal"" has a much better cast but the story can get bogged down and flat sometimes which drags it. Sarah Churchill is certainly ""different"" as an Astaire love interest and as a result I find that aspect quite disinteresting. But there are two Astaire solo spots here that make this film worth getting,his famous dancing on the ceiling and his turn with a coat rack;pure magic. I think the fans of Astaire will find their own moments of pleasure in both these films,but to those beyond that,as musicals,they lack a broader appeal.",1265068800,,8441,4.634846461949266

Fred Astaire and Jane Powell star as the dancers and he outshines her at every turn.  Fred is always dazzlingly charismatic, while she's not in his league as a dancer and lacks his screen presence. Another odd casting choice is Winston Churchill's daughter and Maggie Smith-look-alike, Sarah as Fred's love interest; she spoils the movie because she has no visible talent or charm and there's no chemistry between them.  The story is predictable and dull, with several forgettable vaudeville performances.

Only Fred's impeccable solo dances save the movie from being a total disaster; his famous coat rack dance and the amazing dance-on-the-walls-and-ceiling routine are terrific and well-worth seeing.  The glamour and exquisite costumes we associate with a Fred Astaire musical are missing and the whole thing has a low-budget feel to it.  For Fred's fans only.",1234310400,,1095,5.1875

Jane Powell and Fred Astaire make this film worth seeing.  I've never been a fan of Astaire's.  I knew he was one of the greatest American dancers ever, but he always looked like the perfect lounge lizard, with his slicked back, patent leather hair and the tophat and tails.  He isn't that at all in this movie.

There are three dance numbers worth seeing here:  (1) The best by far is Powell and Astaire's on stage duet of ""How Could You Believe Me..."" (2) Astaire's ""I Lost My Hat in Haiti"" (3) Astaire's marvelous and famous dance on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room.  In none of these is Astaire in his usual film attire.

The rest of the cast I could do without, Churchill's daughter's tepid and unbelievable romance with Astaire and Peter Lawford's nasal courting of Powell.  Ugh.

1358738,5,B00004VVMZ,"Jane Powell and Fred Astaire star in this wonderfully directed musical as Ellen and Tom Bowen, sister and brother dancing team. After their act is broken up in New York they travel to England to put of their show. Ellen is a bit popular among men as she has several male friends; all of whom want to be her boyfriends. It is a bit of challenge for Tom to watch over his sister and make sure that she spends sometime practicing their dance routines. During their stay in London Ellen meets a charming British aristocrat named Lord John Brindale (Peter Lawford) and falls in love with him, and Tom meets a young dancer named Anne Ashmond (Sarah Churchill) with whom he develops romantic relationship. This movie is brilliantly directed by Stanley Donen, who is also known for directing some of the best musicals that include: Singing in The Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, The Pajama Game, and Kismet. The highlight of the movie is Fred Astaire dancing on walls and ceiling; a parody of himself by dancing with a hat rack and imitates Gene Kelly. The solo emphasizes his obsessive rehearsal habits when his sister is on a date. The movie is shot on a great set with excellent dcor and costume. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom and Ellen run on street during the Royal Procession, after the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, to propose to their respective sweethearts; Brindale and Ashmond.

There are several numbers which are very enjoyable and the dance routines are great; ""Every Night at Seven,"" dancing aboard a rocky ship, ""How Could You Believe Me, and ""I Left My Hat in Haiti,"" are some of the best routines of the movie. Jane Powell does her best to catch up with Fred Astaire as his dancing partner. Fred is always delightful to watch, Ginger Rogers was originally slated to play the role of Ellen, but circumstances forced the studios to cast Jane Powell: Highly recommended.

1358739,5,B00004VVMZ,"The release of ""Royal Wedding,' in 1951, fifteen years after the last of the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers films at poverty-stricken RKO Radio Pictures, finds many changes from Astaire's previous work.  He's now at powerhouse MGM Studios, where they boasted of more stars than there were in heaven.  Where musicals were a specialty-- after all, they had Stanley Donen, a talented director of musicals, though they didn't have Ginger Rogers -- and where all pictures, let alone musicals, were in brightly saturated color.  So Astaire costars with Jane Powell, an MGM starlet rather typical of the studio's post-war crop, in brightly saturated color;  Stanley Donen contributes his usual artful direction.  The whole thing, songs and all, is written by anglophile American Alan Jay Lerner, still five years before his smash Broadway hit, cowritten with Frederick Loewe, the anglophile's dream, ""My Fair Lady.""

Astaire and Powell costar as a successful brother-sister team of hoofers, just winding up a Broadway engagement in the dog days of summer. London calls, there's a royal wedding on, as Princess (later to be Queen) Elizabeth is marrying; and the pair is happy to hop the next boat crossing the pond.  The plot actually follows real life: Astaire first achieved stardom dancing with his sister Adele; but she left the act to marry an English lord, as will the Jane Powell character.  Peter Lawford plays the lucky lord. Keenan Wynn plays a dual part, the agent-twins, Irving and Edgar Klinger, one based in New York, the other in London, with, supposedly, the accents to match. (Something must have been lost in translation here, is all I can say.) Sarah Churchill plays the plucky Englishwoman who steps into the act as the sister's replacement.  And yes, she's the daughter of England's great wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, but, unfortunately that doesn't make her a great dancer.  She's also too tall for Astaire, even in the flats she constantly wears, and they ain't got no chemistry.

But the movie boasts four terrific dance numbers, and two that are merely fine.  Astaire's solo in the gym of the cruise ship is a knockout.  His hotel room solo, up, down and around, walls and ceiling, has left generations gasping for breath.  His ""I Left My Heart in Haiti,' is a big, colorful, old school production number. And ""How Could You Believe Me,"" his biggest duet with Powell, owes a lot to vaudeville, and even more to the American writer Damon Runyon: it's got charm to burn.  Powell's a more than competent dancer, especially since scuttlebutt says she had no rehearsal time with Astaire before filming started.  She also has a fine soprano voice: listen as she sinks her teeth into one of Lerner's trademark big ballads, ""Too Late Now.""  And then there's the pair's opening duet, ""Every Night at 7,"" and their witty dance on the turbulent, rolling ship. It's just a lotta dance for your dime.",1186272000,,2913,4.97319587628866
1358740,5,B00004VVMZ,"""Royal Wedding"" is among the top five or so of the great Technicolor musicals of the late 1940s and 1950s. For fans of the genre, it is not to be missed, and finally a decent-looking studio release is available. ""The Belle of New York"", on the other hand, is a different story.

How do these misfires happen? You have the number-one musical-producing studio and number-one musical star of all time, a worthy partner, a supporting cast of terrific character actors, a pair of great songwriters, top pros writing and directing, and yet the result of their collaboration is this lifeless waste of an hour and a half. ""The Belle of New York"" is Astaire's second-to-worst movie, better only than the dreadful ""Yolanda and the Thief"". The plot is uninteresting, and Fred's character is perhaps, this time, just a bit too much of a wastrel to be sympathetic. The special effect of the couple floating and dancing in the air is too silly to watch without a little embarrassment, and the comedy gags don't work. One protracted dance number bringing to life the paintings of Courier and Ives (the Thomas Kinkades of the 19th century) goes on so long you almost forget what the movie was about. ""Belle"" is a genuine flop, without one memorable musical number, and no redeeming attribute other than Vera-Ellen's legs, which are finally shown off near the end.

Buy this DVD package. You'll only watch ""Belle"" once, but you'll watch ""Royal Wedding"" over and over.",1186185600,,1450,4.819277108433735
1358741,4,B00004VVMZ,"Royal Wedding is one of those delightful MGM musicals that graced the 1950's and the likes of which will not be seen again. It has the longest dance scene Fred Astair ever made(his partner in this film was Jane Powell),and has the famous scene where Fred dances on the walls and ceiling of a room, and with a coat rack in another scene. It is light and fun to watch, and ranks right up there with Sing'n In The Rain, perhaps the best musical ever.",1184976000,,447,4.270588235294118
1358742,4,B00004VVMZ,"Leonard Maltin gives three stars to Royal Wedding, but only two and one half to The Belle of New York, which he calls ""uninspired"". Royal Wedding exists in more than forty versions on DVD, including budget versions and in sets. My reason for choosing this new edition is that first, it's in print, while many of the other aren't, and second this is a film that deserves to be seen in a quality version without the skips, stops, color bleeds and edits on some of the budget releases.

After the lackluster opening number, I was ready to turn off Royal Wedding, but as if rising to the challenge, it quickly picked up steam, first with the incredible choreography of Astaire in the gym, next with Powell's wonderful singing, and finally with the excellent Lerner/ Lane musical numbers. Like all Hollywood musical in a musicals, there are long, lavish showstopping stretches of singing and dancing. This film, however, also dazzles with its vivid British sets and lavish scenery and a perfect cast topped by Peter Lawford's effortless portrayl of Powell's flame and husband-to-be, a debonaire English Lord. The unforgettable number is Astaire dancing on the walls and ceiling. Dazzling not merely for technical wizardry (it's probably a rotating room), but for the dynamic performance done, the more amazingly, on a nearly propless stage. I think this piece may also be in one of the That's Entertainment films. If The Belle of New York doesn't quite hit that high mark, it nevertheless provides a chance to see more of Astaire in action, and another little known classic film.",1183248000,,1574,4.917293233082707

1358744,3,B00004VVMZ,"Fred Astaire and Jane Powell play a touring brother and sister dance team, who have a chance opportunity to perform at the same time as the marriage of one of the members of the British royal family.  On the way, they perform some jazzy numbers together [""How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You, When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life,"" ""I Left My Hat in Haiti,"" among others].  What's more, Fred's character manages to fall in love with one of his background dancers [Sarah Churchill, daughter of Winston] and Jane's character falls hard and fast for a British jetsetter [sleezy Peter Lawford].

This film is [perhaps] best known for the famous sequence featuring Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling.  For me, that was the best part of the film and he really lit up the screen, for those few minutes. Otherwise, the whole delivery of this story was [more than a little bit] embarrassing.  As much as I always loved and respect Fred Astaire, this particular picture really was made with mixed results.  One of those factors was Jane Powell.  Her singing voice was so shrill and grating, and her character was so snotty, it made me wish that Ginger Rogers had been cast here instead!  For Fred Astaire at his very best, I reccomend TOP HAT, SWING TIME and SHALL WE DANCE?  The team of Rogers and Astaire will NEVER let you down.",1178409600,,1341,4.531120331950207
1358745,4,B00004VVMZ,"""Royal Wedding"" is a great movie for anyone who loves those big MGM musicals of the 40's and 50's and the dancing of Fred Astaire. Of course, the big numbers in this film include Astaire dancing with a hat rack, which only goes to prove he could make any dance partner look good, as well as the famous number where Astaire dances on the walls and ceilings of his London hotel room. The trick here, well known by now, was that the room was actually set up to rotate. What is wondrous about this scene is that Astaire never seems to have any trouble keeping his balance as this rotation is going on. He just looks like someone who is so much in love he is just jumping with joy from floor to wall to ceiling and back. Less mentioned is the number where he dances with Jane Powell onboard ship in choppy waters as furnishings roll about, but it is also a charming piece of choreography.

The plot is fairly simple. Astaire and Powell play a brother and sister song and dance team, Tom and Ellen Bowen, both of whom claim to be against any long-term romantic entanglement. They are invited to perform in London during the period preceding the wedding of then Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip. While in England they both fall in love, leading to a happy ending for both but breaking up the partnership in the process. It's rather interesting that art loosely imitated life in this case, since Fred Astaire's long-running dance partnership with his sister Adele was ended when she got married to a member of the English nobility in 1932. It's also strange that this film was actually made four years after the royal wedding took place. By that time the royal couple already had two children. As for good supporting performances, Keenan Wynn is quite funny playing twin brothers who are theatrical agents on opposite sides of ""the pond"". They can't understand each other during their telephone conversations because, although both are speaking English, they are using the familiar expressions of their respective countries.

From a technical standpoint, this film is in rather rough shape since it has been in the public domain for some time. However, it is rumored that Warner Brothers is rescuing it from this no man's land, restoring it, and putting it in their upcoming boxed set ""Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory Vol. 2"", which should be available for purchase by the end of summer 2007.",1175817600,,2395,4.7

The dancing, of course, is all the elegance, dexterity, and mind-popping steps we would expect from Astaire, even later in his career.  Jane Powell's gorgeous and poignant voice is another strong reason to get this film.  It is a treasure--the music, especially such pieces as Jane's ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Too Late Now"" are signature songs--so lovely--and they capture an era for many of us that has never been far from our hearts.  Astaire's wonderful, rollicking, ""I Left My Hat in Haiti"" is a charming mixture of song and his unique dance.  The plot is rather Shakespearean--the mixup of lovers--but everything turns out happily in the end.  The bonus?  London--in one of the world's happiest periods!

Combining talents of cute Jane Powell, handsome Peter Lawford and amazing Astaire, this also includes some surprisingly catchy songs that I hadn't heard before. The British woman who plays Astaire's love interest, I also enjoyed (don't remember her name but I hadn't seen her before).

Well cast and well made, this movie, like many other M-G-M musicals, is of a high overall standard. A simple love story about two couples, with of course the common showbusiness theme, set refreshingly in London, ties together well. Of course Fred Astaire gives two of his most famous ""gimmic"" numbers, the dance with the hatstand and on the ceiling. So it does stand out slightly from the other M-G-M musicals that fall outside the ""magnificent"" category.

1358749,4,B00004VVMZ,"Available at the moment only in rather shabby DVD versions, due to copyright problems, ""Royal Wedding"" remains a civilized delight.  Not one of the greatest of MGM musicals, but with a beguiling score by Burton Lane (music) and Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics), and adorable performances from Astaire and Powell, this is a perennial delight, ever so much more memorable than the wedding that inspired it.

It's the songs that keep calling me back: ""Ev'ry Night at 7,"" ""Too Late Now,"" ""You're all the World to Me,"" (Astaire's dancing on the ceiling number)and, best of all, ""Why Did You Believe Me When I Said I loved You When You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life?"" with Astaire uncharacteristically, but hilariously, out of character as a zoot suited tough guy, and darling Janie as his moll.

1358752,4,B00004VVMZ,"Royal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire's dance on the ceiling (""You're All the World to Me"") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian's Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film's merits--it speaks for itself.

The film is now in the public domain and, unfortunately, nearly all VHS and DVD releases of such films are deplorable at best.  That is not so in this case.  The DVD I'm commenting on here is from Goodtimes DVD (edition 05-81171), and I must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a PD film.  The picture is clear, for the most part, and although there are some minor color shifts and age-related artifacts present, they do not distract.  Colors are fairly bold and are well defined.  The soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine.  There are no extras.  I have a very old 1980s copy of the VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video and also a VHS dub I did off Turner Classic Movies two years ago, and honestly, this DVD looks better than both.  It is about as good as we can expect for a PD film that has not been restored from original elements.  Goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of PD films--it could be a lot worse.  Warner Home Video, which controls video/DVD release rights to the rest of the old MGM library, has not given us a studio DVD release of ROYAL WEDDING as yet, and as far as I know none is in the works.

I think the film is badly in need of restoring.  Even the colour (such as the skin on Jane Powell's face) is not constant in the film while watching.  I bought it because I felt I had nothing to lose.  It was a good price and is better than my EP copy that jumps, if that gives you any idea of the quality.  It's probably better if you get a chance to get a hold of a SP version of the video.  Of course the DVD is nice as you can skip to your favourite scenes, but there are no extra features with this one.  Fred Astaire's dancing on the ceiling routine is a real classic though, and the movie is definitely worth seeing!  If you buy the DVD just be prepared to overlook the flaws.  Also, just a warning that there are two DVD versions, one in colour and the other is advertized as B & W.

The picture in the Goodtimes version is much better than the other releases (and believe me I practically bought all of them before finding the best one, lol).*",1021507200,,1367,4.223938223938224
1358763,1,B00004VVMZ,The other reviewers knew what they were talking about. This DVD may well be a contestant for worst video transfer of all times. I've seen VHS tapes that look better than this production. The tragedy in all of this is centered in the fact that the movie itself contains some truly classic Astaire dance routines. Let's hope that somewhere down the line this movie will get the kind of DVD incarnation it deserves.,1016409600,,412,4.657534246575342
1358764,1,B00004VVMZ,"There are two classic Fred Astaire performances in this movie: the dance with the hat rack and his dance on the walls and ceiling. These alone are worth the price of admission. The story is a bit weak and seems mainly an excuse to send the crew to England for the royal wedding of Mountbatten. Still it's very enjoyable.
...The color consistency [of the DVD version] varies from scene to scene and even within a scene. The picture is never sharp and often displays serious compression artifacts. Goodtimes, the publisher of this mess, includes the disclaimer that the DVD was made ""using the best available sources"". Best available means some low-quality VHS tape they had sitting in the closet since they had to access to the master film. The audio is also horrible - noisy and jumbled.
...if you want to enjoy this movie, buy the VHS tape - it's far better...",1014508800,,861,4.671052631578948
1358765,4,B00004VVMZ,"This DVD was great fun to watch! The story line is a little weak but the dance numbers are great! The picture and sound quality of this version is very good (not restored but still good). For the price you can't go wrong! If you like musicals, buy this one!",1013731200,,257,4.16
1358766,2,B00004VVMZ,"Astaire, as always, is brilliant.  Jane Powell and Peter Lawford are charming but Sarah Churchill is a bit too stiff and awkward to play opposite Astaire.  This a good movie ruined by an incredibly poor transfer to DVD.  As much as I admire the MGM musicals it saddens me to see this film represented in such shoddy fashion.  The VHS copy I once owned seemed far superior in quality.  Best to forget this DVD regardless of the low budget price.",1006214400,,444,4.5
1358767,5,B00004VVMZ,"I really enjoyed this movie, and would give it 20 stars if I could.  I highly recommend it.  The musical numbers are great and so is the story.  Jane Powell and Fred Astaire dance beautifully together.  They don't make them like this anymore.
The colors, scenery and costumes in the numbers are great too!",999820800,,305,4.592592592592593
1358768,5,B00004VVMZ,"I highly recommend this film.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  It's a great movie, and has some very wonderful dance numbers in it.  Jane Powell and Fred Astaire are great in it as a brother and sister dance team.",999216000,,220,4.069767441860465
1358769,2,B00004VVMZ,"Royal Wedding is a minor Astaire movie, not even up to Easter Parade, but his dancing was (as always) just amazing. The scene where he dances with a coat-rack is one of my favorites from anyplace (and is clearly an inspiration for Mel Gibson's dance in ""What Women Want"" -- Mr. Astaire does it incomparably better...).
Jane Powell is too chirpy, but they have a very good number together (""How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You When You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life?""), and she can sing and dance. Sarah Churchill (as the love-interest), on the other hand, is really wooden, and the entire subplot with her family is dull.
The real problem is the transfer to DVD. I think that took a worn-out tape from a rental store, left in the trunk of a car for a month, and then made the transfer. It looks terrible. It only cost a few bucks, so I expected it to be poor, but I'd love for some reputable people to release it -- I'd buy it again.",996192000,,959,4.217391304347826
1358770,1,B00004VVMZ,"Other reviewers have commented on the poor quality of the Madacy version of this DVD. I recently bought the one produced by UAV Entertainment and found exactly the same problems so I suspect they may be one and the same pressing. Anyway, don't waste your time on either version - clearly a very poor transfer from inferior stock: lousy sound quality, poor colour, lots of compression artefacts, and badly repaired breaks in the film. This kind of work gives DVDs a bad name, and would be unacceptable even in a VHS version.
Oh, as to the film itself, a couple of good dance numbers, but so weak that I could only recommend it for diehard Astaire fans.",992822400,,651,4.572649572649572
1358771,2,B00004VVMZ,"This is one of my favorite Fred Astaire musicals.  It has some of his classic numbers, such as the hatrack dance and the dancing-on-the-ceiling routine.  Plus, I truly adored the cockney number that Fred Astaire  performed with co-star Jane Powell.  I used to have a recording of this  film I made off the TV, and when the DVD version was available, I decided  to purchase it.
So....what can I say?  The DVD is less then $10, and the  film is great fun.  Fred and Jane play a brother-sister vaudeville act,  probably based on the real-life Fred and Astele Astaire act of the 1920s.  They go to England for their new show and find new love, all during the  time of Queen Elizabeth's wedding (hence the title).  Along the way, we get  those wonderful dances and songs (Jane Powell's ""Too Late Now""  won the Oscar for best song, I believe).
However....the DVD transfer is,  to be polite, poor.  The color looks faded in some spots and there is  horrible pixelation or blockiness in other spots (especially at night).  The sound quality isn't that great either, (but at least it sounds better  than my TV recording).  That's not saying too much, though, given the  potential for DVDs.  This film looks like a straight transfer from a poor  VHS copy to DVD with no attempt at clean-up or restoration.  This trait,  however, is common to all Madacy DVDs, so I wasn't expecting any surprises  there.  One reviewer mentioned a widescreen version - I don't think this  film was made in widescreen but rather in full-frame, so what you see on  the screen is all there is to the film, I believe.
At any rate, bottom  line...the movie itself gets 5 stars but due to a rather lazy DVD transfer,  I can only give the DVD 2 stars.  However, it *is* less than $10, so decide  for yourself if it is still worth purchasing.",963360000,,1805,4.5375
1358772,4,B00004VVMZ,"This film doesn't have many memorable songs, but it certainly has its moments.  The highlight of this film is when Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling and walls of his room. The quality of the film is not that bad. The  movie has a Easter Parade feeling about it. It is not the best film Astaire  ever made, but it is well worth watching.",953424000,,337,4.234375

7924093,1,B00004VVMZ,I've only watched 'Royal Wedding' (1951) a couple times however I recently watched it right after 'Easter Parade' (1948) and the quality is quite poor in comparison. The screen credits at the beginning are crooked and shake. Also the color is off and the images are slightly blurred. To forwarn it seems like a pirated version.,1521676800,,327,4.857142857142857

Despite being one of the ""lesser"" Astaire movies, it has some of his most memorable routines in it, including the dancing on the ceiling routine. Its a fun movie. However, the quality of the video on the DVD is poor. It looks as though someone converted a VHS to digital and stuck it on a disc. Still, for the price its better to have a copy of this film than not.  Still, I wish a better version existed.",1515888000,,462,4.021739130434782
