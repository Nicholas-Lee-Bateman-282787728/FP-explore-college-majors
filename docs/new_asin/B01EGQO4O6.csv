7735010,4,B01EGQO4O6,"Some years have passed since the success of ""Thai Warrior Ong-Bak"" which launched action superstar Tony Jaa to superstardom and his follow up hit ""Tom Yum Goong"" (aka. The Protector). The much anticipated sequel to ""Ong-Bak"" had experienced quite a few obstacles during filming. Tony Jaa was at its helm as writer and director but for some reason, stopped production until his mentor Patta Rittikrai came to finish the film. This sequel occurs in a different period with different characters than the original; I wondered as to how it got the same moniker. I supposed the production folks wanted a familiar title for its audiences. Nonetheless, if what you are looking for is Martial Arts ACTION, ""Ong-Bak 2"" delivers.

A young man named Tien is orphaned when his family is murdered by a rival noble. Tien is found by a group of slave traders, and for some reason, the leader of the Pha Peek Krut Pirates, Cher Nung takes pity on the boy. Nung notices the young boy's fighting spirit. The boy is trained in all manner of fighting and grows up (this time played as Tony Jaa). Now a highly skilled fighter and has overcome many tests of manhood, Tien is appointed second in command of the pirates. But there is an innate anger within Tien, he hungers for revenge. He seeks out the killers of his family but there is more to things that meets the eye. Tien must now fight for his life alone.

Granted, the plotline in Jaa's previous films weren't works of ingenuity and this film is quite the same. The plot in ""Ong-Bak 2"" is pretty routine and unimaginative. The details of story are shown in flashbacks, and quite honestly, there was effort in making an intricate storyline, but the execution is very weak. The film's narrative stumbles and there are plot holes aplenty; certain parts of the film felt too rushed no doubt to meet its deadline. There are a few attempts at an effective twist, but it felt more like a throw-away detail since none of the characters involved were fully developed. Some characters come and go, and I failed to connect with the protagonists.

There are certain familiar characters that show up, there is the ""Crow Ghost"" introduced by Dan Chupong in ""Tabunfire"" who uses some razzle-dazzling martial arts with the use of explosives, there is a touch of mysticism (with a blind shaman and a fanged woman), ninja-like fighters, a samurai swordsman, a practitioner of kung fu, there is a jiu-jitsu master, an Arab warrior -- the film does have a lot of potential and this group of pirates is a large assemblage of warriors; the problem none of it felt relevant because of the lack of development. The characters while colorful appeared to be a mere  attempt at style than a part of its storyline. Tien also has a love interest, but it never goes anywhere. The film has a lot of cool elements but it's narrative needed to be more cohesive.

Thankfully, the film's action sequences are as impressive as Jaa's previous films. There is a lot of swordplay, hard-hitting punches and bone crushing kicks to satisfy the action junkie. Tony Jaa still maintains his ""no wires"" style as he performs his own acrobatic, jaw-dropping stunts which had proven to be his signature. There are some minor use of wires utilized by some of the stuntmen but none too elaborate. His previous films feature his prowess in the moves of Muay Thai and kickboxing, and in this film, Jaa displays several different styles. Jaa makes use of a Tai Chi sword and a katana, some Gong Fu, a dose of Jiu-jitsu and even some moves from Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"".  I suppose that this was meant to be an exposition that Tien's character is well-versed with martial arts from China, Japan, and Thailand. It is a nice touch as Tien is trained to become the most dangerous fighter in this period.

The cinematography is quite decent and well engaged in showing all the bone-crushing action. The scenes mostly take place in the jungle, and unlike the original ""Ong-Bak"" and ""Tom Yum Goong"", the set ups for the action is pretty routine and may prove repetitive to some. The action is quick, intense and bloody brutal at times, maybe more brutal than the original. The film does have a gloomy atmosphere and delivers most of the plot with a straight face. However, it may have too much of a serious tone, and Tien appears to be obsessed with one emotion; anger. Much of the film's screenplay are minor set ups for Jaa to show his skills as a martial artist and not as an actor. I know this film flies high as an action film but the lack of emotions tend to dull the narrative impact of the fight scenes. The climax also ends in a cliffhanger and I thought it was rather unsatisfying.

""ONG-BAK 2"" is the type of film that stays aloft due to the number of action sequences and just how impressive they are; on this regard, it doesn't disappoint. Sometimes we need a pure action film and this film is one of those bone-crushing, stylish, hyper-kinetic action films that action fans would talk about because of its fight sequences and never because of an intricate storyline. There is some ambition this time around in presenting an in-depth plot but it was abandoned in favor of action. The climax does prove a little too empty and unsatisfying, but it does have enough action to hide its many flaws. No acting, no wires, and no emotions--Jaa and Rittikrai does deliver in terms of excitement in its display of martial arts action in the form of Tony Jaa!

Highly Recommended! [4-Stars]

The all-region Malaysian release is the one I own. (I have no idea what is being sold here in amazon through independent vendors)
Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Good video transfer accompanied by a great 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack in Thai. English subs are good but not perfect.",1240963200,,5769,4.6973293768546
7735011,4,B01EGQO4O6,"Meaningful plot + Impressive Special Effects + Fascinating Fighting Scenes.

Its plot is more meaningful than Ong Bak 1.

The special effects are impressive. For example, the scene where Tony fights against a huge crocodile is scary and exciting. The crocodile looks very real.

Also the scene where Tony make an elephant kneel down is mazing.

The fighting scenes are top notch. The sword fighting scenes are new. They do not exist in the original Ong Bak.

In short, it's a sequel but it's better than Ong Back 1.",1240444800,,515,4.741573033707865
8758646,3,B01EGQO4O6,Good movie but brutal. It's not the kind of movie I want to watch again or own. It has the most satisfying scenes of martial arts that I've seen. Some scenes were too disgusting and brutal for me to watch.,1495756800,,205,4.15

Looks like those guys put a lot of effort and spent some money, film is definitely not cheap. Don't worry about subtitles, you won't need them.

8758652,4,B01EGQO4O6,"My man from Thailand (Tony Jaa) returns in a fight-filled quest for revenge.  The movie takes place a few hundred years ago amidst political and social chaos.  The film starts with a young boy named Tiang running from the group of men who just killed his parents.  The angry lad is picked up by a slave owner who puts his possessions on display for amusement.  Tiang is soon rescued by a band of guerilla-land-pirates who take him in and teach him martial arts... all kinds of martial arts.

I'm not really sure why this was slapped with a franchise tag, as this has nothing to do with the original ""Ong Bak"", though the original film's title was the name of a Buddha statue, which is glimpsed here.  The film's producers are making another movie that IS a direct sequel to part 2, which is good, because the ending may leave you scratching your head.  If you've ever seen the old-school kung fu classic, ""Rebellious Reign"", you know the type of ending I'm referring to.

I don't know that any more description is necessary.  What you should know is that the movie is fun and well done, with much less of a silly story than Jaa's previous efforts, which is not to say that this will be nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.  Maybe next time?  Jaa helmed the director's chair for this and apparently got in over his head.  You'll never know from watching it as the sets, scenery, camera-work, and action is fluid and beautiful.  Some of the action scenes have a bit of that annoying wavy look, but not like in American films where there is the constant cutting of angles.  They are shown from just far enough away, with several moves shown before changing views, just like the best of Hong Kong action.

How about those fights?  Way cool.  Jaa breaks free from the repetitive (but still awesome) boundaries of Muay Thai with lots of styles (including Drunken) and weapons.  I normally prefer straight fights to weapons but this flick may be an exception.  It takes a little while, but Jaa ends up breakin' out the 3-section staff, my absolute favorite.  The stunts are also top-notch, with some amazing elephant scenes!

I was initially angry upon receiving this copy of the DVD from Malaysia (distributed by Keris Video) as there was no listing for English subtitles, just Chinese.  But RELAX:  There ARE English subtitles, they just can't be accessed from the film's menu.  If you use the ""subtitles"" button on your DVD remote or player, they are there, I assure you.  Beyond that, the picture quality is widescreened and beautiful, and this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

8758653,5,B01EGQO4O6,This movie single-handedly places Tony Jaa with the masters of martial arts films.  His mixture of choreography and various styles of martial arts rival those of other artists.  There are several lengthy sequences that should prove to be classics.  A must see and a must have in any martial arts/action film library.,1243036800,,316,5.038461538461538
8758654,4,B01EGQO4O6,"The title of my review partially sums Ong Bak 2 up. There is plenty of kung-fu ,sword fighting,and several other styles of martial arts here. This in fact,is completely different from the original and The Protector. Ong Bak 2 is set in ancient times so it is kind of a prequel. The brutal style of muy thai displayed in the forementioned films is not the star in this film. Nonetheless,Tony Jaa looks very seasoned executing  other various styles of martial arts in this movie and the action is plentiful(and real too).Its set in ancient times and there are some truly beautiful and epic scenes in this one. My only complaint is that the version I have doesnt have subtitles,but like I said the action and picture quality makes up for it. Watch OB2 with the knowledge that there is a part 3 that is meant to be simultaneous with it as well. Overall a great martial arts flick with that Saturday matinee kung-fu flick feel to it.",1242604800,,928,4.5568862275449105
8758655,5,B01EGQO4O6,"This is hands down the best martial arts display I have ever seen.  I have been watching and collecting MA films for over 25 years.  Being a martial artist myself I also appreciate the skills when I see them.  Tony Jaa delivers in this epic tale of Pirates, revenge and betrayal.  Beautifully shot and directed ,and the choreography is out of this world.  Tiger style, Thai boxing, acrobatics, every weapon you can think of and even some traditional ritual dancing lights up the screen.  I can't say enough about this one!  Tony Jaa is the reigning prince of the MA world!  My only criticism would be the abrupt ending.  Oh well, it's all about the non stop action!  A gem!",1241827200,,673,4.533333333333333
