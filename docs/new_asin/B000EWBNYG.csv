8115014,3,B000EWBNYG,Some nice gore effects from Thailand. You don't have to have seen part one to appreciate part two. Black magic.,1385769600,,111,4.6
8115015,5,B000EWBNYG,"I own a collection of Asian movies and this one went right on the top 5. The story is brilliant and the acting is awesome. It has the GORIEST scene I've seen in my life. And take into account I've seen Audition, Human Centipede 2, A serbian Film among others. If you are into this cool genre, you'll love it.",1364688000,2,308,4.15

Long Khong, released in English-speaking countries as Art of the Devil II, was one of Thailand's initial attempts at a gore film. (While they still haven't gotten it completely right, they've done some interesting things with the genre in 2009's Meat Grinder.) It is, simply, not all that good a movie, though it seems to have been made with the best of intentions, and was enough of a hit at home that it spawned a sequel in 2008. It's a pretty well-put-together thing, but it suffers from a script that tries to do far too much and ends up succeeding at doing none of it.

Plot: two years after graduation, Ta (Alone's Namo Tongkumnerd)'s father commits suicide, and he and his five closest friends journey out to the remote village where he and his second wife, Aajan (Mae Bia's Napakpapha Nakprasitte)--who taught the children during their last year of high school--retired. That's likely enough of a setup to let you know, given that this is a slasher film, who the movie's final girl is. Soon enough, once they get to the village, the blood starts flying, and the six-but-ever-decreasing friends have to figure out who's targeting them and why.

No, you won't see it coming, and the reason for this is that the script doesn't give you clue one, preferring to spring the climax on you while you're completely unawares. The only problem is, that makes the climax reach almost Gumnaam-levels of ludicrousness. Every time you ask yourself ""how much sillier can this movie get?"", you will find that the answer comes back ""oh, you have no idea.""

As if that's not enough, well, you're probably not watching a gore film for the spectacular script (unless you're me looking for the next Turistas). And I gotta say, the opening sequence, which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the movie, had me squirming in my seat. The gore effects go downhill from there, however, and by the time you reach the ""oh, aren't I shocking?"" conclusion, you may well be yawning. These actors, and the uncredited (at least in English) cinematographer who gave us such stunning jungle shots, deserved a great deal better than the script they were working with. **",1352764800,,2189,4.7678100263852246
8115017,4,B000EWBNYG,"I watch the first one first before watching the second one and I must say that the two does not connect.  You can watch this one without bothering with the first one as the first one was just ok.  The second one was actually pretty good.  The story line itself was awesome.  Its about black magic.  Watch the film closely so you'll understand why things are happening towards the end.  I'm not into gore and many scenes were very ""gorey"" to me, I had to look away or cringe many times.  All in all, great movie.",1289433600,,511,4.260416666666667
8115018,5,B000EWBNYG,"Art Of The Devil 2 is way better then the first one. Once you fiure out how to change the audio track(on the remote,not through the setup)to the thai language. The movie starts out slow but gets good in a hurry. The last half the movie is pretty gorey. This movie is highly reccomended if you like Asian Horror. I am not sure why a sequel is better then the original but in this case it is. Besides Shutter this is probabaly the 2nd or third best movie out of thailand.",1234656000,,469,4.164835164835165
8115019,5,B000EWBNYG,"So ... was Art of the Devil 2 (""Long Khong"" in Thai) scary?  Hell, yeah!  Enough gore to satisfy fans of Hollywood-type slasher movies, and peppered with generous helpings of ghostly apparitions and other supernatural elements to satisfy me.  It has got to be the most graphic horror movie to come out of Asia so far, and I'll have to confess that there were very many scenes where I simply had to turn away from the screen or cover my eyes.  I couldn't sit through the whole movie at one go - I had to pause it and do something else to settle my nerves several times.  I'm very squeamish about seeing blood and am therefore not a fan of slasher movies - I would probably not have enjoyed ""Long Khong"" one bit if not for the fact that it is not simply a slasher movie but also a ghost story and a movie about black magic and the consequences of using it.  Thailand has a reputation amongst Asians as the capital of the black arts, and possibly even the Thais themselves believe this, so it is not surprising ""Long Khong"" was such a massive hit in Thailand.  Anyways, the Cliffs Notes version of the story goes like this - spoilers ahead.  A once adored female teacher of a small-town high school is caught on tape by her stepson and his school-mates having an affair with the handsome but villainous gym teacher.  The gym teacher confronts the group of friends, threatens them with a gun, and sexually molests several of them.  In revenge, they seek the help of a shaman to cast a very nasty spell on the gym teacher, resulting in his very gory death involving some very nasty fish-hooks.  Not content with that, the friends proceed to broadcast the tape in the school cafeteria, ruining the reputation of the female teacher for good and destroying her marriage - she descends into madness.  The friends then graduate from high school and go their separate ways - the stepson being the only one to stay behind in the small-town.  Two years later, they each receive a call from the stepson telling them that his father is dead, and inviting them to his funeral.  The friends eagerly accept the invitation as an opportunity for a reunion, not realising that their journey home will end in pain, madness and death.  For lurking in the background is a wronged woman who has waited two years for revenge, and she will do anything to get it, in very painful and inventive ways.  For she has killed the shaman, eaten his flesh, and absorbed his dark powers into herself, and she is now ready to unleash unimaginable horrors upon those who wronged her.  And the dark arts are not all she is armed with - her arsenal includes some rather sharp machetes, a syringe filled with tranquilisers, a blow-torch, a pair of pliers, an electric drill, a kettle of boiling water, a large jar of pickled mangoes, some large pots of chicken soup and fish curry, and very handy first-aid resuscitation skills (the better to revive near-dead torture victims with).  And oh, how she's going to have fun teaching her former students new lessons in terror and pain ...  One hour and fourty three minutes later, I'll never quite look at geckos (you know, those lizard thingies with that ""gecko, gecko"" call) the same way again.",1169424000,12,3199,4.57092819614711
8115020,3,B000EWBNYG,"This movie is ok. Not the best asian horror film I have seen. The movie starts off kind of boring. We see these kids getting back togther after awhile because one of the friends father has died. They stay with their old teacher who is actually one of the kids step-parent. In the past, the kids have a secret. While trying to videotape the gym teacher having sex with the step-mother they are caught and rapped. They take revenge by placing a spell on him. The step-mother finds this out and takes revenge on them while they are staying with her. Each death is quite gruesome. This film is a low quality thai movie. I love asian horror and this movie has its moments. It does not stand up to par with movies such as Infection, Tell me something, or even Premonition.",1163030400,6,766,4.401408450704225
