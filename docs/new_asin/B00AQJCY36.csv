5471239,5,B00AQJCY36,my 4 year old loves the show but it airs on cartoon network during his nap time so having the movie makes it easy for him to enjoy Ben 10 at any time. now his 2 year old sister loves Ben as well and sings her own theme song. there is a lot of action but nothing too scary for the little ones so it was an excellent add to our collection.,1368489600,,337,3.6944444444444446

5471241,4,B00AQJCY36,"You didn't think you'd see the last of Ben Tennyson, did you ?!  Well, this new CGI movie would be considered a ""lost chapter"" from the original Ben 10 series.  In it, Ben, Gwen and Max are back from their long summer vacation when he gets the surprising opportunity to take the Total Alien Immersion training program.  He'll use his alien hero forms to their full potential, but there's a catch: he may never turn back to his old self again !  And if that's not bad enough, a new intergalactic threat is after Ben and his Omnitrix leading up to the ultimate showdown.

Along with this action-packed film, there's a bunch of cool bonus features like commentaries and concept artwork.  So for all you ""Ben 10"" fans out there, you gotta get this.  And also look for new episodes of the newest chapters in Ben Tennyson's saga in the new series ""Ben 10 Omniverse"".",1367280000,4,860,4.509677419354839
