8251652,4,B0013KY3OU,I rented this movie on Netflix last night and found it pretty interesting. I would watch it again and am considering buying it. The acting and cinematography was great. I am now a fan of Michael Fassbender after watching him in this movie and Jane Eyre. Fantastic actor.,1316390400,,270,4.645833333333333
8251653,5,B0013KY3OU,"The fact that Ozon could conceive, pitch, sell, make and distribute a film such as this should be a shot in the arm to anyone suffering from fearing the demise of quality films for adults. The above reviews enumerate the joys of this film, but no writing can give a sense of the ""filmic"" genius employed by Ozon and his creative/technical team. The sheer beauty of this film is staggering, from enhanced coloration of details to the ravishing lighting of the actors, putting it into its own category among relatively-recent films. Beauty is what the title character wished to create, and Ozon has superbly translated her quest, with all its disturbing artificialities, into a voluptuous vision that makes this a contemporary fix for those missing Visconti. But what makes ANGEL so particularly marvelous is Ozon's unwillingness to douse his critical mind in all this cinematic liquidity: we know from the start that this is not Merchant Ivory (PTL), but far more akin to Todd Haynes. A pitch-perfect cast is never condescended to by the director; the line is never crossed over into nasty-minded ""clever"" post-modern smirking at the material, the bane of so many otherwise well-intended films aiming at the same ideas. In fact, the earnestness with which the characters (especially Romola Garai, fearless in the title role) embrace the material is refreshingly free of self-consciousness, startling (and slightly discomfitting) from the start.  Ozon should be saluted for having the energy and guts to push through his projects; while he (and a handful of others out there) manages to do this, film is not yet dead.",1294099200,12,1615,5.071428571428571
8251654,4,B0013KY3OU,"This is one of Francois Ozon's best films. I've read mixed reviews about it and I believe that's the standard for most of his films. So I went ahead and checked this one out. I'm glad I did because I sincerely enjoyed it. The story was tight and the lead actress who played Angel was good. I've read some reviews where some found her capricious and insolent and I could see that. But despite all that, I also found her to be strong-willed and ambitious. And unfortunately at times people like her will end up in a bad light. I did have sympathy for Angel in the end.
The movie flows well and I didn't really notice that it runs a bit over 2 hours. I simply found myself enjoying it scene by scene. Although I will admit that in two scenes, the pace seemed a bit rushed and could've used more time to expand itself with the consequences of the actions that took place. But that's really just secondary in the end.

A time to leave is my all-time favorite Ozon film with Angel and Swimming Pool coming in afterwards.",1216166400,15,1014,4.30890052356021
8251655,4,B0013KY3OU,"**** 2007. Written and directed by Franois Ozon. England in the first years of the XXth century. The daughter of a grocer becomes a trendy writer whose books are read by mostly women. She falls in love with a no good painter who'll be unfaithful to her. Filmed like a photo-story or like an intrigue of one of Angel Deverell's books, ANGEL is an excellent surprise that proves once again if needed, after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5X2/dp/B000ARXG0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5X2</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Women/dp/B00007J5VT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Women</a>, that Franois OZON is currently the most interesting French director.
