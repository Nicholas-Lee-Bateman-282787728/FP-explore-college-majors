8427094,5,B004EJ006C,"K-9 is a fine series that so far has run two series. One from 2009, and one from 2010. it's not cancelled , the brits often go years between series. So it may return. This one features fine special effects and is aimed at kids all the way. But adults can enjoy this show as well. K-9 is a robot dog that seems slmost alive and of course dr. who fans and fans of 'the sarah jane adventures' will know about k-9. That later show is gone because the lead actress died from cancer recently. It was a hit show though. This one features half hour episodes and therefore moves very quickly. K-9 has a family of people that he interacts with and the boy starkey seems to love him the most. Anyways you do need a all region dvd player to watch this set. Both seasons should be put out in the u.s. as the scy fy channel recently played all 26 episodes on christmas day 2012 in a marathon. Lets hope k-9 the show returns , but if not get yourself a all region dvd or blu ray player and watch this fun show. Your kids will love k-9! This is so much better for them than some stupid video game which teaches them nothing about characterization.",1357084800,,1131,4.168949771689498

I have been a big fan of K-9 since I first saw him in the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who. I was excited about buying this new series.
However, the product description did not clearly state that it was not compatible with the North American format. It would not play on my Blu-Ray or DVD player and I had to return it for a refund. The refund was promptly made and if it is ever available in a format I can watch I would promptly buy it.
Exterminate! Exterminate! :)",1345248000,3,563,4.118181818181818
