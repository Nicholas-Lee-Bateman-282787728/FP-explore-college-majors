8369920,1,B002GQ65UA,"I've bought ""your first real Dance Class No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3-
and have also payed the tax for Germany and shipping.
All the three DVD's are absolutly idendity - and there is no difference
between no. 1 and no. 2 and no. 3 - the context is always the same.!!!
I can' t believe it. So No. 2 and No. 3 can I throw away.
It's probably a mistake in producing ???
I'am very disapointed.... wasted so much money !!!",1273622400,,411,3.963855421686747
