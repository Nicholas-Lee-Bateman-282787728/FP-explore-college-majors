7877752,3,6304819757,"Although Gregg Araki is a film director and producer whose work in alternative (mostly gay-related) cinema I cherish, I really cannot say that ""Totally F(uck)ed up"", from 1993, is among my favourite films of his, whether as the first part of his ""Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy"", or amidst his wider body of work, or among the works of other directors and producers, either. The DVD edition viewed was a North American one (Peccadillo Pictures PPD-227). For all my quibbles, ""Totally F(uck)ed up"" does have its charms and a certain magic to it, if one be patient enough to untangle the strands, or at least some of them, that comprise the tangle of gay relationships unfurling within the film. They seem pretty much pell-mell, leaping back and forth from one thing to another.

For me, the most arresting to one's attention among the pairs of gay boyfriends and ""hook-ups"" in the film is that of Andy and Ian, played, respectively, by James Duval (looking quite different here as than he had as sweet but dopey character, Jordan White, in ""The Doom Generation"", part 2 of Araki's trilogy) and Alan Boyce. They are surely the best-looking young dudes in the movie, as well, and their gay relationship generates a lot of romantic and sexual heat, although there is little bare skin visible in their scenes together (and only two quick glimpses of full frontal male nudity in the entire film, so far as I noticed). Their love gives some temporary meaning to Andy's life. When Ian disappoints him and the two fail to connect by telephone at a critical moment when Andy, who has found little worth in living apart from this relationship, goes into deep anguish and commits suicide, the viewer really cares (or should do so) about the fate of these two young men. Fixing one's attention on their scenes (the most enjoyable and sexy in the film, anyway) can make some narrative sense of at least their parts of the movie, then, on reviewing, the rest, the action and the other characters, falls more easily into place.

I purchased ""Totally F(uck)ed up"" in order to complete the trilogy, of which this film is the least satisfactory segment. However, once I got my bearings in the confusing mish-mash of ""Totally F(uck)ed up"", I really did come to enjoy it.",1452470400,,2246,4.786082474226804
7877753,1,6304819757,"Gregg Araki's ""Totally F***ed Up"" is one of the most horrible movies ever created.  The break in segments, flashing signs of quotes to live by, have no relevance to the movie.  The characters are all typically fake.  You don't believe any of them are gay except Deric and he's bashed during the film.  Then the ending...how miserable!  I believe that films like this should not exist outside of the ""hard to understand Sundance Film Festival"" category.",1053388800,5,452,4.894736842105263
7877754,3,6304819757,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF THE MOVIE I ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY.I GIVE IT AN AVERAGE RATING BECAUSE I WAS EXPECTING MORE.THE ACTING WAS OKAY BUT THE STORY WASNT REALISTIC AT ALL, SO I RECOMEND RENTING IT BEFORE YOU BUY.",991872000,10,211,4.3
7877755,3,6304819757,"This is also one of the most depressing films I have ever seen.  The movie starts out with a newspaper article telling us that 30% of all teenage suicides are committed by gay teens.  So immediately I am thinking: ""Oh man, one of these kids is going to kill him/herself.""  (I was right.)
The lives of these teenagers consist of hanging around doing nothing, hanging around doing drugs, and having sex.  Some of them have jobs, but it does not look like any of them go to school.  This is also a very depressing but realistic portrayal of way too many teenagers lives-both gay and straight.
This movie is good because the teens have to deal with many issues that face gay teens often these days.  One of the teens is gay bashed-he is not killed, just banged up pretty bad.  One of the teens is kicked out of his parents' house when they find out that he is gay.  A couple of the teens find out that their boyfriends are cheating on them, but the two guys deal with this pain in very different ways.
The ending of the movie sucks, in my opinion, because there is very little closure--which I guess is realistic, but it is not very satisfying to the viewer.  When the movie ends one of the teens is dead.  One is still recovering from getting gay bashed-he is also one of the guys that found out his boyfriend was cheating on him, so he is doubly miserable.  And the one, who was kicked out by his parents, is still trying to find some place to live-he is not living on the streets he is living with the friend who got gay bashed.  So, basically, this movie ends, and I get the feeling that nothing is going to improve for any of the surviving teens because their lives are still going nowhere and they really do not seem to be that motivated to make their lives go somewhere more positive.  The fact that this is what the characters' lives are like (going nowhere fast) probably goes a long way towards explaining why one of them ends up killing himself.",990403200,28,1952,4.34435261707989
7877756,5,6304819757,"I watched this movie not knowing exactly what to expect..  I had seen all of Gregg Araki's other films, and I am one of his biggest fans..  The movie is kind of slow moving at times, and it fumbles for words a lot, but at the same time, it shows a generation in turmoil..  the characters in this movie represent the teenagers of the current generation..  this movie tells the story of a group of gay friends who deal with the worst s**t a teenager has to go through..  it covers, aids, sex, homosexuality, love, drugs, and suicide..  During a time when these kids are just learning what each of these things are, they have something new shoved in their faces..  none of them really know what life is, or what is to come, but they all fell that they have nothing to do wirth it or no part of it..  Most of the people i knew when i was that age went through at least some of those same feelings..  the overall feeling i had in the movie was disturbed..  i wasn't sure how else i felt until i watched the last credit and i felt upheld and relieved..  i saw how bad my life could have been and what i could have had to go through..  this movie is one i think all indie film fans should see if not own..  watch it and love it for yourself..",982886400,28,1235,4.095833333333333
7877757,5,6304819757,"Independent filmmaker Gregg Araki takes an everday look at several gay and lesbian teenagers (4 gay boys and a very cute baby dyke couple ) whose friendship provide a '90s-style family unit. This flick mixes together a  head spinning/heart wrenching combination of queer teen angst, homophobia,  AIDS, suicide, love and hope..
I really liked the parts where the the  kids were just ""talking"" to the camera about issues and their  feelings. It was so bitterly honest I just couldn't believe it. Very  unusual, and touchingly rad. BRAVO!  As you may remember, everday life for  any teenager means crisis, loneliness, rebellion, and the search for love.  Growing up gay adds another dimension to the angst and turmoil of teen  life. This flick shares a rare, honest look at teenagers. They aren't made  out to be Clueless or given a Hollywood ""treatment"" to make them  more glittery and sellable. This film will shock you, make you laugh and  most likely make you remember the pain and desperation of being that  'alien' boy or girl who just didn't seem to fit in with barbie and ken..",964396800,24,1082,4.8469945355191255
