Look at the price on this thing: sixty bucks. Then, look at the length: 19 minutes. That's over three dollars per minute of viewing! How could this possibly be worth the money?  This is typical of a lot of educational materials made for schools. The people who buy these materials are not--for the most part--spending their own money, so they're not as careful as you or I would be about spending. The result is ridiculously overpriced products like this one.  You get much better value for your money if you buy educational materials that are meant not for schools but for the general public.
