It pretty much revolves around a list which both the Ching and the Ming loyalists want. The list contains a list of Ming loyalists. Carter Wong and his two compatriots are each entrusted with part of the list. The three must fight for their lives -made more difficult because one is a traitor.",974073600,,386,4.375
7896922,3,6305888817,"Good Martial arts action, with some choppy fight scenes. Carter Wong is good as a rebel fighting against the ching armies, but still not one of his best parts.  A Good villian in the general, who had the silver hair, and  had pretty good kungfu, but still He wasn't SilverFox.  Why they called it  Silver Fox Massacre, im not sure?  But it was a good film anyway.  If you  like Carter Wong get it or atleast watch it, but if your lookin to see  Silver Fox, don't get robbed.",964051200,,474,4.247191011235955
