8167311,2,B000M8UMVC,I couldn't make heads or tails of this. The only reason it got 2 stars is because it's a western (sort of),1526688000,,106,3.8636363636363638
8167312,1,B000M8UMVC,"If you you like tragic,unhappy endings,this film is for you. SPOILER ALERT-ENDING GIVE AWAY::

The hero gets killed,the evil killer rides off free and unpunished,and the young hero's widow is left miserable,covered with her husband's blood. There is almost no action(just talk)until the bitter end. Audie Murphy appears for only a few brief minutes in what is essentially a cameo role.",1303516800,4,385,5.311475409836065
