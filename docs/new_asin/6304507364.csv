This was my favorite go to exercise in the 90's If you want a serious tummy workout this is it.  The moves look so easy you are not sure if you are doing it correctly until the next day when you feel the results. (This tape not only works your tummy, but your waistline,back and arms) Just wish I could get this on DVD.  Took me for ever to find a VHS player.",1397779200,,442,4.011363636363637

I like how the result is long and lean rather than building bulky muscles. I was so tickled to find a copy still available after all these years. My husband uses it too. He says it helps his lower back pain.
Thanks so much for having it!",1376092800,,359,4.142857142857143
