8147276,2,B000IQF1GO,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would provide historic footage of news-worthy anti-Semitism, racist events, or propaganda - perhaps similar to the Nazi propaganda film ""The Eternal Jew"", or at the very least report-style coverage of same that I could use in a course I teach on Racism; what I got was a collection of mini-films, ""American Girl"" and ""Don't be a Sucker"" among them, that were intended as public messages against racism & anti-Semitism in 1950s K-12 schools, using actors and a very 1950s script.  For example: ""American Girl"" is about a non-Jewish teenager who wears a charm bracelet with Jewish symbols she received as a gift, and ends up ostracized & shunned by her friends and their families as a result. It is very simplistic and mild fare, and is less than compelling. The ""Don't Be a Sucker"" is a tale about a street corner hate monger giving speeches against foreigners that take jobs, Jews, etc. A Holocaust survivor talks to one of the men in the audience afterward, how this is reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Other installments are about multiculturalism & diversity in schools.

While these may be of interest to some, it fell short of the mark of expectation for the title ""Historic Jewish Discrimination & Racism Films.""  Technically speaking, these films ARE historic in 1950s context, but little more than that.  A better product description would have gone a long way.",1265587200,6,1398,4.911016949152542
