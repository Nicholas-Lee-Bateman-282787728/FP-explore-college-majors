2553230,4,B000F6R5CK,"What a great way to compare the ""old ways"" of education and the passion of a young educator who gets to connect with his students through innovative methodology.  The bureacracy of government regulating education gets an appropriate criticism too.  No five stars due to the lack of subtitles, specially in other languages (Spanish) which would have made the product perfect!",1223769600,10,374,5.216666666666667

2553264,5,B000F6R5CK,"Based on the book of the same name by Pat Conroy, this is a delightful film which we showed at a Retirement community here in South Carolina.  It was very well received.",1439337600,,169,4.28125
2553265,4,B000F6R5CK,This is a good version of this story. I think the Jon Voight film 'Conrack' gives a little more accurate portrayal of what it was like on the island according to the book. This movie makes the major point though. Mr. Conroy made a difference in the lives of those children and their parents. Inspiring story.,1438905600,4,308,4.517857142857143

This movie offered many ideas with which to share with our unique DD community.  So many things were not right/fair in the movie's children's lives, and that offers many teaching subjects and discussions occur.  I also watched it with my 8 year old grandson.  We had similar discussions.  What a great movie.",1386460800,2,548,5.112359550561798

2553289,5,B000F6R5CK,"Since I am a teacher, I really enjoyed this story of a young teacher in a small town. It was really an island and he travelled there by boat! He had to use some unconventional methods to teach his young class. His board of directors didn't really like his ways but the children did and boy did they learn! their field trip was especially fun to watch. Great family movie.",1376697600,4,371,4.314285714285714

2553304,4,B000F6R5CK,"After moving to the Low Country, I read all of Pat Conroy's books, then watched the movies that were made from the novels.  Scenery is amazing, and the movie is really good.  Of course, after reading the book, the movie had a lot to live up to, in my imagination.  Pat Conroy is a hero, though, in my book.  I'm looking for him every time I go out:).",1368576000,7,350,4.102941176470588
2553305,5,B000F6R5CK,I have been a fan of Pat Conroy since reading Prince of Tides.  He is a great American story teller.  He writes from his heart and in turn touches your heart.  Enjoyed the DVD very much.  Great family entertainment especially with parents and teenagers of today.,1365292800,5,262,4.630434782608695

A completely new look at a one room school house, kids of all ages and abilities, and bringing to life the world beyond their island shores, and furthered by a trip to his U.S. home, to widen their worlds and the wonders that are there for them to explore!",1358208000,,296,4.285714285714286

2553310,5,B000F6R5CK,"I would have loved to have lived on this beautiful island with it's year round warm temperature. and had the wonderful, caring, innovative teacher those children had.  Also all the parents seemed to really care about their children and take a very active role in their children's lives. It was a touching, really enjoyable movie. Another good family movie from Hallmark.",1291075200,,370,5.065573770491803
2553311,4,B000F6R5CK,"This dvd will inspire and excite you!  It is full of energy and passion.  You will want to lobby against huge schools and bureaucracy and will long for the one room school house.  That said, the original John Voight version ""Conrack"" is preferable and more realistic (no hills depicted as the setting is South Carolina's lowcountry).  Also many of the families who still live on Daufuskie are not pleased with Pat Conroy's portrayal of them which magnifies himself to their detriment.  Fortunately, the true setting Mary Fields School is still used regularly for church summer camps, town meetings, and even birthday parties.  The families still are able to live on Daufuskie Island and maintain much of the culture depicted in the dvd.  Most of all, Daufuskie still has a marvelous school serving 16 children ages 4 through 11. And yes, the teachers are passionate and the students thrive!",1268870400,27,890,4.972972972972973

8117948,5,B000F6R5CK,"The Water is Wide is an excellent dramatization of Pat Conroy's book about his year of teaching Gulla children on an isolated South Carolina island reachable only by boat.  The actor who played Conroy conveyed his dedication to the children, impatience with bureaucracy, and his sense of humor.  This Hallmark Hall of Fame version is better than the movie, ""Conrack,"" which also dramatizes ""The Water is Wide.""",1500681600,3,410,5.104477611940299
