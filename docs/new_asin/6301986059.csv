417925,3,6301986059,"Novelist Agatha Christie occasionally remarked that while she was a great fan of the actress, Dame Margaret Rutherford was NOT the Jane Marple of her novels--for instead of giving us a fluttery and demure woman, Dame Margaret played the role with considerable aplomb and considerable eccentric British humor.  Chrisite purists will probably be outraged by Dame Margaret's complete reinterpretation of the character, but there is no denying that she is a great deal of fun to watch.
This particular outing finds Dame Margaret investigating the mysterious death of an elderly man and the subsequent murder of one of his heirs--an investigation which leads her, most improbably, to an inn catering to the horsey set.  Although very free in adaptation, the actual plot follows Christie's novel ""Funerals Are Fatal"" quite closely, and a charming supporting cast--including Flora Robinson--add to the fun.  Lightweight and charming.",1008979200,8,926,5.461538461538462

418024,5,6301986059,"All of the Margaret Rutherford ""Miss Marple"" movies are outstanding. I don't know that Dame Margaret was necessarily playing Agatha Christie's Miss Marple as much as her own lighthearted, insouciant and supremely self-confident Miss Marple, but her interpretation is wonderful. Any fan of Christie will enjoy these films, and even those not familiar with her work will be delighted by them.",1487894400,,390,5.409836065573771

The inspector in this series is constantly being outdone by Miss Marple and the way she always expresses a doubt about the obvious criminal. Rutherford, aka Miss Marple, puts herself in precarious situations where her own life is at stake while she goes about solving the crime and--is always right! Her charming male friend, Mr. Stringer, often goes to bat for her and helps out. (She was actually married to Stringer Davis until her death in in 1972.) I advise getting the whole series and then sitting down with ""cocoa"" (Miss Marple's fav) and enjoying for as long as possible.",1432339200,,757,4.968503937007874

418336,5,6301986059,"I remember when I first saw Margaret Rutherford as Jane Marple.  I had read a number of Agatha Christie books, and like most people, I had a specific person in mind when reading some of the Miss Marple series.  If I had hand-picked an actress to portray Miss Marple myself, I couldn't have made a better choice.  I had seen Margaret Rutherford in many British films in the past and she had become one of my favorite actresses.  But to see her as Miss Marple was the icing on the cake.  Though her portrayal has been followed by several wonderful and talented actresses, no one could come close to the perfection of character that Dame Rutherford had.  I love all four of the Miss Marple films she made and I'm so happy to have the chance to see them again after all these years.  Thank you Amazon!",1406160000,3,797,4.380952380952381
418337,5,6301986059,"A treat with three marvelous character actors- Margaret Rutherford, Robert Morley and Flora Robson. AND Rutherford's real husband, Stringer Davis, playing Mr. Stringer. Agatha Christie's Miss Marple was in no way a comic character. Joan Hickson played the old lady to perfection. Nevertheless , the Rutherford Miss Marple films are delightful in their own way and very English. Tea and crumpets English.

If you have never tried Amazon's Instant Movies, let me say a few words on the subject. I have rented many of them and the SD (standard definition) films have always been excellent. HD (high definition) may be superior, but I stick with the SD's and save a dollar. If an occasional glitch occurs with a movie you have rented, their customer service (I select chat but you can send an email) will straighten things out for you and if your movie selection simply won't play after they do a bit of tweaking, they will refund your money. I am particularly grateful for these movies because many of them are captioned and I am deaf. However, in some cases if the dialog is complicated the captions come in handy for non-impaired watchers.",1406073600,3,1138,4.865979381443299

Enderby's poor relatives gather at the The Gallop, a combined boarding-house and riding school. Miss Marple also gets there to find out if any of them had any particular reasons to see him dead. Written by Mattias Thuresson(taken from Imdb)

Stringer Davis as Miss Marple's  easily distracted assistant helps behind the scenes to resolve the crime.  Charles Tinwell as Detective Craddock always has an answer but Miss Marple at the end sets him straight.

Fortunately, they rarely stop with just one body (not when more's the merrier!).  Marple, with the able assist of her dotty librarian friend (Rutherford's husband Stringer Davis), swings into action when the ever doubtful Inspector Craddock (Bud Tingwell) refuses to take her seriously.  With suspects aplenty, there's plenty to ferret out.

418519,4,6301986059,"I'd never been tremendously interested in Agatha Christie's elderly spinster sleuth, Miss Marple. Still, I was in the mood for a cozy whodunit and MURDER AT THE GALLOP was playing on TCM and I gave it a try and was astounded at the fun I had in watching it. Know that Margaret Rutherford - I said ""Who?"" during the opening credits - plays Miss Marple as sturdy and take-charge and eccentric rather than prim and birdlike delicate. Word had it that Christie herself was less than enthused with how this film played out, but maybe that's more to do with that her trademark suspense was swapped for a light comedic tone. The film's misleading advertising slogan alone - ""The Raciest Murder of the Season"" - is worth some chuckles. Whatever her gripe, Christie dedicated one of her books, THE MIRROR CRACK'D FROM SIDE TO SIDE, to Rutherford. MURDER AT THE GALLOP is a 1963 MGM joint. It adapts AFTER THE FUNERAL which is actually a Hercule Poirot mystery.

The film opens with Jane Marple and her constant companion Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis, Rutherford's real-life husband) going around town drumming up support for a criminal rehabilitation program. They arrive at the home of the elderly Mr. Enderby, only to see him collapse of fatal heart failure. A keen observer of human nature, Miss Marple is convinced that his death was induced by foul play. Naturally, the local Inspector dismisses her suspicions, and so there's nothing left but for Miss Marple to conduct her own investigation. The story eventually relocates to a horseriding academy wherein Miss Marple, in the guise of an equestrian client, proceeds to rub elbows with the suspects, most of whom are relatives of the deceased and looking to inherit nice lumps of money.

Heaven save us from prying old women! How it must vex Inspector Craddock (Charles Tingwell) that each time he's summoned to a murder scene, that curious busybody, Miss Marple, is already there with her theories and suggestions? Margaret Rutherford is spry and robust and is great fun as she eavesdrops thru doors, peeks thru windows, and lurks in the bushes. She's not even averse to a bit of meta-narration as, in one scene, she refers to her own creator, Agatha Christie. Rutherford is bolstered by a cast of British supporting actors, most notably Robert Morley as the Gallop Hotel's stuffy proprietor and Flora Robson's timid Ms. Milchrest. And because I'm a manly man, I must mention Katya Douglas of whom a lot of people will never have heard. Still, she's the potential femme fatale in this lot and she is gorgeous.

""Well, I'm planning to have a heart attack at the dance tonight,"" Miss Marple airily informs a mystified Inspector Craddock. So see Margaret Rutherford get on the dance floor and vigorously do the twist, all to further a scheme she has to trap the killer. There's a generous serving of red herring and so the identity of the murderer may come as a surprise. Still, Miss Marple is tireless in her snooping, even though she suffers several narrow scrapes and even an attempt on her life. As a reward she even receives an offer of matrimony, which she promptly turns down.",1366675200,,3128,4.82122905027933

What a character, who stands up to the police when they try and dismiss her as a crank.  Of course, Robert Morley is a grand actor, as always, and doesn't disappoint.  All of these Marple movies, are worth seeing and give you a good flavor of what Rutherford brings to the role. OK, you may want to skip Murder Ahoy.",1352764800,,461,4.4

418601,4,6301986059,"Margaret Rutherford is an absolute jewel playing the amateur detective, Miss Marple.  She steals almost every scene with her semi-dotty manner, but each time surprises with that smashingly brilliant and piercing British logic!

Ms Rutherford's foil in this movie is the ever-droll Robert Morley, a stand-alone comedian in his own right.

Margaret is also abetted in her humorously sleuthy ways by another excellent actor ... this time, her true-life spouse, Stringer Davis (although not many knew of this cinefact).

All-in-all, Murder at the Gallop is a delightful canter across a country lane and is a whodunit par excellence, based on Agatha Christie's After the Funeral.

The entire DVD is clear and wonderfully transferred from the original B/W 35mm negative elements.

Dash it all ... what an entirely wonderful and satisfying romp!

418602,4,6301986059,"Murder at the Gallop (George Pollock, 1963)

Miss Marple has a penchant for turning up in the oddest places. This was never more evident than in two of George Pollock's Miss Marple movies, Murder at the Gallop and Murder Most Foul, both of which were actually adapted from Christie novels featuring Hercule Poirot instead of Miss Marple. As to be expected from the Pollock/Rutherford pairing, it's witty, urbane, and utterly shallow, but a great deal of fun while you're watching it.

Marple (Rutherford) and her friend Mr. Stringer (Rutherford's husband, Stringer Davis) are called out to investigate the death of Mr. Enderby (Finlay Currie), supposedly frightened to death by a cat. That's a bit far-fetched, and sure enough, Miss Marple turns up evidence of murder in short order. Gather the suspects, there's a mystery afoot.

Margaret Rutherford may have been close to the end of her career here (she retired from film in 1967), but she's at the top of her game, as are much of the rest of the cast. And a fine cast it is, including Robert Morley, Bud Tingwell, Katya Douglas, James Villiers, and the great Flora Robson. It may be empty calories, but just like that chocolate cheesecake, the consumption of it is enough of a delight that you don't mind the extra workout afterwards. *** ",1271289600,,1292,4.859090909090909

418604,5,6301986059,"This mystery is a marvel. Miss Marple is once again fascinating. Fascinating because she can do so many things that are so unexpected, such as climbing the top of a pile of barrels on a draughtsman's cart to snoop, overhear and eavesdrop in order to know what is being said in a private meeting in some notary public's office. But she reveals herself again as an ex-champion this time in horse riding in some kind of competition some decades ago. She even reveals herself as a Charleston dancer in the old days turned a twist dancer in the early 1960s. Persistent little booger who cannot be stopped even by a criminal, and a nasty criminal there is in the surrounding vicinity. Everyone expects a man and it is not. Everyone expects a family person and it is not. Everyone expects the criminal to hit and strike again and that is the real truth. It happens in no time, over and over and over again. Marvelous. But she declines a proposal that would have been charming business for her but she is too keen on snooping and meddling and investigating that she cannot accept to become a businesswoman behind a counter even if it is a luxury counter. And I must admit Margaret Rutherford is a prodigious actress that can turn any simple situation into some kind of dark deep mysterious menacing trap, for criminals of course but also for the audience. And her films have such a wonderful level of humor that it becomes hilarious at times like when she pretends she is suffering a severe heart attack. We wonder how gullible people can be, criminals can be to fall into such a shady but threadbare trap. It is true this second level reading or watching is also one essential element in these simple films.

418605,5,6301986059,"Oscar winner Dame Margaret Rutherford was the first to play the famous Agatha Christie amateur sleuth. This time around, Miss Marple is doing her usual charity drive and runs across a dead wealthy recluse. The death is cited as a heart attack due to his fear of cats, but Marple has a piece of hardened mud of a riding boot marking. She deliberately listens through the window of the reading of the will and none of the family seem to upset over the death but are keenly interested in what they might gain. The estranged sister declares he was murdered and Miss Marple finds her later stabbed through the back of a chair with a long hat pin. The nephew owns ""The Gallop"" a pseudo hotel riding stable and Ms. Marple declares to the always exasberated Inspector Craddock, she is going on holiday--much to his relief (or so he falsely assumes). It it at the Gallop the movie unfolds and clues mount complete with false leads until the killer is revealed. But only after Marple fakes a heart attack in order to corner the murderer of the brother and sister.

The Miss Marple MGM series made in the UK only totalled 4 films although a fifth installment was announced at the end of the 4th movie--it never materialized (possibly due to Ms. Rutherford's failing health).

There have been many Miss Marple incarnations, but Rutherford was the first and the best. She plays the role as Christie created her with great panache and wit. The spinster sleuth is as clever a detective as any of Mrs. Christie's inventions and other writers of the genre.

Rutherford is a delight, as usual and real-life husband Stringer Davis plays her friend and sidekick. Charles Tingwell is also great as the sometimes harassed Inspector Craddock who has to take the snooping Miss Marple with more than a just grain of salt.

The complete Miss Marple series has been compiled into a DVD set and is worth the investment because once you watch just one, you will want to see the other movies in this worthwhile but short-lived series.
