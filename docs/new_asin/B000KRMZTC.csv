8158946,2,B000KRMZTC,"I first watched this film when it first came out, and as far as I can remember I liked it.  But then, as a child, I liked all British war films.

I am sure there was tension in the camp at the time, but frankly the film is boring.  And risking death for no good reason does not seem to me now at all sensible (although I have done it myself).  No doubt the action itself was a coup against the Germans, and deserving of praise, but the film is so pedantic and predictable that the most excitement I got was when I found it in a charity shop for 50 cents and was looking forward to watching it.  From then on it was all downhill.",1425945600,,628,3.9523809523809526

8158948,4,B000KRMZTC,"I first read the story of The Wooden Horse 60+ years ago and was enthralled by it. I've re-read it several times since. When the film first came out I saw it and thought it a good representation of the book - excellent acting and authentic sets. I've since seen and enjoyed the film several more times and always enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the soundtrack of the DVD is not the best for an oldie like me and a lot of the dialogue passed me by. In my case it didn't matter too much due to my familiarity with the story but someone seeing it for the first time might find it off-putting.",1401321600,,584,4.223214285714286
8158949,4,B000KRMZTC,"THE WOODEN HORSE is part of a cycle of British films produced during the Fifties, in which various struggles during the Second World War were replayed, as a way of reminding audiences to feel proud of their country's achievements at a time when Britain's position in the world was becoming less and less influential.  The British Empire was crumbling, rationing was still in place, and while Britain still had a seat at the United Nations table, they had very little power to influence world affairs.  In Jack Lee's film, the ingenuity of British POWs is celebrated; they not only have the ability to create something out of nothing, but they always seem able to outwit their German captors (whom they term ""Goons"").  The characters are penetratingly delineated, with Leo Genn's phlegmatic Pete leading the group of three escapees, contrasted with Anthony Steel's more emotional John Clinton.  Nonetheless they make an effective pair, especially when they have to negotiate some difficult situations in the German town of Lubeck.  David Tomlinson, normally associated with comic roles (as in THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS), has a rare chance to essay a straight role; this he accomplishes with aplomb, as a cheery officer with a unique capacity to make the best of difficult situations.  What makes Lee's film most memorable is the fact that it was filmed on location, using German and Danish civilians in supporting roles; they speak both their native languages as well as English.  This gives the film a sense of gritty realism, as well as reminding us about just how dangerous the escape plan, using the wooden horse, actually was.  Tonally speaking, THE WOODEN HORSE is very matter-of-fact; director Lee is at pains to show that the entire escape was not about heroes, but was actually the British POW's bounden duty.  This gives the film a documentary realism that ensures it stands up well today, over sixty years since it was originally released.",1400457600,,1945,5.034267912772585
8158950,5,B000KRMZTC,"This 1950 prisoner of war film is set in Stalag Luft III, the same camp from which Allied airmen made their getaway in ""The Great Escape"".  Determined to tunnel their way out, Anthony Steele and Leo Genn devise a method of conceiling their digging efforts from the German guards.  They build a wooden vaulting horse which is placed in exactly the same spot in the exercise yard every day.  While other prisoners jump over this horse for hours at a time, the two men concealed inside, did into the ground below.  At the end of the day, they cover up evidence of their digging and are carried back into the barracks inside the wooden horse.  At last, their digging pays off but they have a long way to go and many close calls before they will be free and clear of their German pursuers.  An excellent film based on a true-life event.  It is fast paced and has lots of tension.  If you like escape films, this is one of the best.",1392249600,,926,4.343023255813954
