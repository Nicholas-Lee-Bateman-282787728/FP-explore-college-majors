8312969,3,B001JIEQA2,"Love Comes Lately is one of those ""sometimes good, most of the time boring"" type of romantic comedies.  I definitely didn't think it was especially appealing from a storyline point of view.

It's about an old man who travels away from home in search of meeting a variety of women (one at a time).  Each woman apparently wants a romantic involvement with the old man in some way, which usually leads to the women eventually making a move on the man.

Apparently the old man doesn't particuarly feel comfortable (or perhaps he doesn't care) about the romance these women have in mind, because he hardly takes advantage of an opportunity to flirt or kiss these women when it presents itself.

The only really funny part is when another man invites the old man to come along for a car ride, and when he arrives home he tells the old man to wait in the passengers seat, but as soon as the man enters the house he apparently shoots his wife which prompts the old man to become totally shocked, jump in the drivers seat, and take off driving.  After this -in the pouring down rain- he gets out of the vehicle once he believes he reaches a safe spot and hears police sirens.  He jumps out of the vehicle with his hands held high in the air but the police drive right by, lol.  This is funny because obviously the old man had nothing to do with the shooting, and the police didn't suspect he was present at the scene either.

I actually think I'm too young to appreciate the subtle nature of a comedy that honestly feels intended for older folks.  Not necessarily people in their 60's, but people approaching their 50's with plenty of romantic experience under their belt.  These are the type of people who'd be able to understand the comedic approach of Love Comes Lately.",1323388800,,1764,4.498432601880878
8312970,1,B001JIEQA2,"I've been trying to watch this movie for a couple of month now but I have not succeeded yet. Once in a while, when I have recovered from the previous try, I watch like 10, 15 minutes but then again I get so bored and annoyed that I have to turn the player off. I seems to be a kind of road movie where reality blends with dreams and daydreams. The pace is so slow, the direction is so poor and the dialogues are so bad! But the most annoying ingredient is the music. The score is so incredibly ill-matched with the movie, I have never seen anything like it. Where you would expect a kind of light-hearted, somewhat animated music, there are those depressing layers of sad strings that would better fit a psychological thriller or a documentary on sand in the desert.
I like the main actor a lot and the trailer of ""Love Comes Lately"" was modestly funny and witty but the actual movie, unfortunately, is very odd.",1244937600,,912,4.3391812865497075
8312971,2,B001JIEQA2,The actors did a great job I just didn't get the tradition's .  I can see some people really enjoying it.  I really like all the actors. (Just did not enjoy it.),1242432000,,161,4.0
8312972,4,B001JIEQA2,"""Love Comes Lately"" is based on three short stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer that combine fiction, fantasy, and autobiography into a comedy/drama of the conflict between the male ego and the inevitable physical decline of age.  Though in a longtime relationship with Reisel (Rhea Perlman), octogenarian author Max Kohn (Otto Tausig) uses his frequent book tours as opportunities to let erotic imagination take flight.  But his fantasy flings with a needy widow (Caroline Aaron) and a Cuban housekeeper (Elizabeth Pena) give way to a real-life intimate encounter with a former student (Barbara Hershey).  Finally, a fondly recalled but painful interlude with a free-spirited woman (Tovah Feldsuh) challenges Max's peace of mind even as it inspires him.
 Uniformly first-class performances give life to the characters here.  Writer/director Jan Schutte portrays Singer alter-ego Max Kohn as a guy who, even at his advanced age, has little difficulty attracting women.  What may seem at first a dirty old man on the prowl evolves into a fully fleshed-out character study of a writer who creates as long as he is inspired, and is inspired as long as he creates.",1233446400,5,1157,5.227027027027027
