7824515,3,630235403X,"I rented this movie having no idea what it was about, i needed to get three movies and just grabbed this one. I love foreign movies, and thought it would be interesting to see a Russian one. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, it seemed to be good, I liked that it was in black and white. However I didn't feel there was enough plot, or that enough was being told. The ending made be rethink the whole movie, which I thought was great. It was quite interesting to see a movie so different than what's out today.",1024963200,3,518,4.088235294117647
7824516,5,630235403X,"Pavel Nazarov's ""Freeze Die Come to Life"" is a tremendous film with a clear and unwavering vision. It is delivered with all of the stark realism you'd expect from post-Soviet experimental Russian cinema. To be sure, this is an art film. Western audiences accustomed to bloated Spielbergesque productions and connect-the-dot plot lines will not find much to like in Nazarov's work.
Set against a brutal and bleak geographic backdrop (Siberia), the film's main characters Valerka and Galiya serve as intense splashes of desperate color throughout the film. Valerka, especially, stands as the archetype of wide-eyed youth and innocence - a condition slowly drowned in places like Vladivostok. Through circumstance, Valerka and Galiya find themselves associating with thieves and con men, stumbling through one experience after the other unaware of the dangerous path they have taken. The ending is tragic, unexpected and delivered with brutal resignation.
Visually the film is crisp and sharp. Nazarov's use of black and white film is used to great emotive effect.
""Freeze Die Come to Life"" remains my favorite Russian film. Despite the seemingly stark and vicious series of events the film portrays, it stands as a testament to the underlying goodness and strength inherent in youth, no matter how fleeting that moment is.",1001808000,14,1320,5.350961538461538
