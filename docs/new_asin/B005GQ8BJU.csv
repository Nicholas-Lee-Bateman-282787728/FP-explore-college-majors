8472156,5,B005GQ8BJU,Devil's Crossing is an EXCELLENT feature film! Michael Sharpe is a phenominal actor and James Ryan Gary is a brilliant director. It's hard to believe this is an independent film with the score Alex Mauldin provides. Excellent movie all around.,1313020800,3,243,5.1
8472157,5,B005GQ8BJU,"I'm a huge fan of everything zombie, books, movies, comics you name it and I've probably seen it or read it. The Devil's Crossing is truly one of the best independent zombie movies that I've ever seen. The production values are amazing, the acting blows away any of the low budget zombies out there and that plot is completely unlike anything else out there. If you like a good zombie movie then this one is worth watching.",1313020800,4,423,4.5064935064935066
