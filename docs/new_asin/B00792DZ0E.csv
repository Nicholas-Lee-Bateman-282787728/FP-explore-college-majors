8512507,5,B00792DZ0E,"I bought this DVD as I am leaving Hawaii after 21 years and I want to have a small collection of films made in or about Hawaii. This movie has only one speed. Slow. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. I kept waiting, hoping something would happen next, or at all to justify my time. It certainly does portray a segment of the youth society/culture that exists here and there is value in that, but I doubt many other people outside of the islands would care or relate.  This movie gave me a good dose of anxiety.  I could not believe just how gullible and downright stupid some of these kids are and how disconnected from them their parents are.  I was just waiting for someone to wake up and pay attention. But I guess that's the whole purpose of the film. There really isn't much hope for a future for the youth over here. Having had raised my son here I can see that is an accurate portrayal.  Watching this film was like peeking through the windows into our neighbor's homes and lives. Not a pretty picture and one reason we are heading back to the mainland. Once you get off the beaches here life is very difficult for the average family and there is not much of a future for the kids.  I don't regret buying this film. If I can get some of my mainland friends to sit through it, it would save me a lot of effort trying to explain a lot of things to them that they can't get about this place from the postcards and the travel channel.
I gave it 5 stars because of its accuracy, rawness and the willingness to make a film about something that most people don't want to know about. Not very entertaining for the average Joe though.",1341187200,6,1640,4.260450160771704
