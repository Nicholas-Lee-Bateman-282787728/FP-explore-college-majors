8443228,5,B004VDL7FO,This tribute along with the Trilogy IT-O Lucky Man-Britannia Hospital defines the Art of Film. See them together and it will be hard to settle for less.,1382313600,2,152,4.666666666666667
8443229,2,B004VDL7FO,"If you like Malcolm McDowell, and love ""O Lucky Man"" you will find much of this interesting. But it quickly gets boring. It isn't paced fast enough, and much too much of this is simply reading to the camera. Instead of purchasing this, borrow it, watch it once, and when you wake up from falling asleep return it to the person who loaned it too you.",1359158400,,349,4.303030303030303
8443230,5,B004VDL7FO,"If you are a die hard Malcolm Mcdowell fan or really like film making this could be a good pick.
Then again, if you are a die hard Mcdowell fan and you have such films as ""If...."" and ""Oh Lucky Man"" on DVD
much of what you will hear Mcdowell talk about in this one-man-show he already talks about in interviews that
are part of the extras on these other DVDs. I have Never Apologize,  Oh Lucky Man, If... and Britania Hospital
all on DVD and there is a lot of over lap in the interviews, but as someone who likes to collect DVDs instead of
watching broadcast or cable TV it's worth it to me.",1308873600,8,591,4.094827586206897
8443231,4,B004VDL7FO,"NEVER APOLOGIZE is a 2007 documentary of Malcolm McDowell's one man show/tribute to director Lindsey Anderson.  McDowell has a sharp wit and is a wonderful storyteller.  Sadly, this event is filmed on video and presented full-frame.  It's not nearly as fun as O LUCKY MALCOLM (the feature length McDowell career retrospective included on O LUCKY MAN DVD and CLOCKWORK ORANGE ANNIVERSARY/STANLEY KUBRICK COLLECTION BRDs).  Still, it's a touching tribute to the underrated and (sadly, to US audiences) largely unknown Anderson.",1307577600,3,525,5.525
