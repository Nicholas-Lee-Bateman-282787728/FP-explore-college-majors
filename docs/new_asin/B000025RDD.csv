8162561,5,B000025RDD,"Emerald Jungle, also known as Eaten Alive, ""This is not true, this movie is no comparison to Eaten Alive. I remember watching this movie maybe 5 or 6 times back in the day. I remember the women were from Alabama, they flew to New York, then on to whatever jungle they ended up at and they ended-up being eaten by cannibals but, in the movie Eaten Alive the people were eaten by... (I don't want to ruin your movie). I wish they would put this movie on DVD. The 229.00 dollars is entirely too much to pay for this VHS tape. If it was on DVD I think it would sell quick because it is a great movie. I personally would buy it after watching it several times already.",1521763200,,663,4.147286821705427

8162563,4,B000025RDD,"Emerald Jungle, also known as Eaten Alive, by Umberto Lenzi, of Cannibal Ferox fame, offers up all the gore, flesh eating, and nude females that one expects from the Italian cannibal genre but this time the plot of the movie is a bit stranger, if not better, than usual.  The basic plot outline of the film is this, a film is found by the dead boby of a cannibal living in New York, the film contains fotage of a womans long lost sister, the woman heads to the jungle in search for her sister only to find out that she has joined up with a religious cult seeking solitude in the jungle, whos leader feeds his followers drugs to obtain their loyalty. Where do the cannibals come in you ask? Well the cannibals have the cults village surrounded, killing and eating anyone who wonders out away from protection. I highly recomend this film to lovers of Italian gore films or gore lovers in general.",1031616000,5,894,4.451219512195122
