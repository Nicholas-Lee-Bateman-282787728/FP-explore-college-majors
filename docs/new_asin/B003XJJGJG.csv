8408168,5,B003XJJGJG,"I enjoy this video. Songs include ""Bad Girls"" and ""We are family."" Moves are fun and not too hard or too easy to learn. Aerobic impact level I would describe as moderate. Not particularly long video. I think it's about 30 minutes, but I just skip around to do my two favorite songs (a few minutes each) so not really sure on total length. The instructors are fun and nice to look at. My favorites are the lead female Asian instructor and Mark the young white guy. I have the whole series of ""Disco Abs"" and they're all good. My hubby and I do them together.",1484870400,,557,4.264150943396227
