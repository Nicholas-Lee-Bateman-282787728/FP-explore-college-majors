8686641,1,B00P76FELM,"That isn't to say that I dislike the content, the show is excellent. The packaging is top notch. I suppose it is my mistake for assuming that for $50 I would be getting more than the first episode. Interested buyers, you read that correctly: this is only the first episode of the show. I would still highly recommend giving this a watch, it is on Netflix currently.",1460160000,6,365,4.462686567164179
