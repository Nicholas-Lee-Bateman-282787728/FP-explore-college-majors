However, this show wasn't nearly as good. Michael toned it down and cleaned it up for this performance. He looked out of place in this variety-show hall, and seemed at times to play awkwardly to the camera. I recommend skipping this DVD and catching him live at a comedy club.",1475539200,,446,4.321428571428571

And while I was watching, I texted several friends to tell them to turn it on. It takes a lot for me to sit through a comedy show, and this was so awesome that I'd looking for it on dvd.
