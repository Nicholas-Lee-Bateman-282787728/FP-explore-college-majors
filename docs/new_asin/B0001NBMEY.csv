2020899,5,B0001NBMEY,"My wife and I love this movie when it came on TV.
been searching for it for years !!!
My only request would be for the movie to be re-released on DVD with some additional info, such as outtakes, script, etc.",1046476800,4,207,4.073170731707317
2020900,5,B0001NBMEY,"Excellent movie !!
Thi is really the best Robin Hood ever made.",1008633600,,63,4.333333333333333
2020901,5,B0001NBMEY,"Who's the best Robin Hood...Errol Flynn, Kevin Costner, or Patrick Bergin?  I say that Bergin wins hands down!
It was a crime that this movie was released the same year that Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of  Thieves"" came out.  It was, as a result, released on broadcast TV  instead of in theaters.  I would have dearly loved to watch this movie on  the big screen.  Alas, it was not to be.
The atmosphere, the costumes  (for the most part), the characters and their interactions, the music, the  degree of cleanliness and lack thereof of characters and their abodes, and  the version of telling of the tale of Robin Hood ring most true and fun in  this movie than in any other I have seen.  Think about the main  contenders...Errol Flynn in his perfectly form fitting tights, and Kevin  Costner in his consistently clean and styled hair simply can't match the  presentation of Robin Hood that Patrick Bergin brings off.
I thought that  the representation of the ""splitting the arrow"" in this movie was  excellent.  I also liked the fact that the Baron Deguerre wasn't really  aware of the political situation he lived under -- John versus Richard --  and, in the end he makes up his own mind...though I wonder whether his head  would later demanded by John(?).
Uma Thurman makes a great  Marion...headstrong, determined, defiant, and free-spirited.  Her decision  to leave the castle and see what's happening in the real world makes the  movie believable.
Finally, the filming of the movie, with a sort of an  overcast hue throughout (until the very end) provides a sense of winter  breaking into spring, representing hopelessness giving way to hope for the  common person.
I have watched this movie several times, and I know that I  will watch it many more times.  It's a great telling, without excessive  killing or violence, language is not an issue, and there is only a limited  amout of innuendo regarding Robin and Marion.
At the same time, it must  be said that there are a few missteps in technical portions of the  film...the falling scaffold scene is the most noticeable.
A solid 5 stars  for acting, atmosphere, and story.
Top-notch!

2020902,4,B0001NBMEY,"This version of Robin Hood makes the most effort to be a period piece of any big-screen version. Rather than pandering to the mass-market expectations of what a Robin Hood movie ""should be,"" it attempts  to show what a ""Robin Hood"" of the late 12the century could be.  The costumes are spot-on, the weapons are museum-accurate, and the period  politics permeate everything.
The performances are all good. Jeroen  Krabbe is my favorite as a Norman noble having a very bad week. A nice  touch is having all the Normans speak with silly French accents (although  two of them are played by a Dutchman and a German) and the Saxons all have  appropriate English accents. William Hobbs' fight direction gives a sense  of the weight of the swords, heavier and more deadly than the typical  hollywood rapier. Most of the other good stuff in the movie is covered by  the other reviewers.
There were a few things that kept this movie from  being perfect, however. The chain mail armor was obviously shiny silver  fabric. A few action scenes seemed awkward, specifically: Robin and Will  ride a falling scaffolding to the ground, and when done, are running along  with the crowd that is inexplicably still running; the start of the  climactic battle at the end in the castle courtyard is somehow undramatic  and rather confusing.
One other thing bothers me: I first saw this movie  on FOX TV when it first aired. A friend taped it for me, but the tape was  grainy. When it played on FOX again years later, I taped over it, only to  find that many of my favorite bits had been cut out. I bought the  commercial vidiotape, and found that though some of the bits that were  edited were still in the film, some bits were still gone, leaving some  scenes feeling incomplete or truncated, losing some foreshadowing, and  missing some good character bits. Now the movie plays occasionally on my  local WB, essentially the videotape version with some minor edits for time  and content. I don't know where to get that original version I saw.",959904000,9,2020,4.702857142857143
2020903,5,B0001NBMEY,"An attempt to show the legend in a more realistic light. It lets the viewer put faces on the people of the ""Dark Ages"", and assumes that they could have been as political in their thoughts, the Magna Carta  would soon arrive, as we are today. Filmed in a dark brooding style that  brightens in color at the ending, its humor and vision allows the viewer to  remember it's just a faire tale. View it after April 15 and pay attention  to Robin's speech on Taxation.",916790400,6,463,4.348837209302325
2020904,4,B0001NBMEY,"This verison (which was first made as a theatrical film for European cinema, then shown on FOX TV, and then shortened for video by about forty minutes) stars Patrick Bergin as the outlawed Earl of Huntington (portrayed with some touches of humor and plenty of physical action and presence); Uma Thurman as a very independent Lady Marian; Jeroen Krabbe as the Norman lord who was once Robin's friend but must now hunt him down; and Jurgen Prochnow as an extremely pouty and self-important Guy of Guisbourne.  This version does not attempt to clean up the legend of Robin Hood (as in some previous versions), but instead reveals it in all its down-and-dirtiness, especially when showing all the opression that Robin is fighting against.  If it could be released in its full length, this would be a must for any collection, but even in its shortened state it's well worth seeing.  END",883785600,10,881,4.821192052980132
2020915,5,B0001NBMEY,"Probably the best Robin Hood movie ever made. The right mix of humour and action. Patrick Bergin is a much under-rated actor who brings the character of Robin Hood to life with his performance, and Uma Thurman is as always beautiful as well as talented. A must see movie for anyone who loves the legend of Robin Hood.",1473811200,,317,4.482758620689655
2020916,4,B0001NBMEY,"I like this version a great deal.  Patrick Bergin makes a fine Robin Hood, and the supporting cast is solid, especially Jurgen Prochnow, Owen Teale and David Morrissey.  The only complaint I have is the music . . . while inspired in places where it is subdued, the action music tends to be repetitive and rather annoying.  Too bad, really . . . in an otherwise well-written, executed and under-rated film.",1471046400,,405,4.676056338028169
2020917,3,B0001NBMEY,"Basically, awful in almost every way.  The performances are over-the-top, especially Uma Thurman, who seems to be doing a pantomime when she's required to register Love. A gritty Robin Hood is not necessarily a GOOD Robin Hood, and the Merry Men & sundry all end up performing the obligatory Middle Ages village dance straight out of WILLOW. Baddies are bad! (and how), and the best turn here is from Friar Tuck.  All in all, a surprisinglty forgettable film from the usually excellent Working Title.",1462579200,,500,4.940476190476191

2020929,4,B0001NBMEY,"Released around the same time as Costner's 'Prince of Thieves', this movie was pushed aside by its competitor's marketing budget. But it's a better telling of the story and Bergin's a more convincing, more athletic Robin than Costner. Thurman and Prochnow are interesting choices in the supporting roles and both do well. It's not a great film but it's eminently watchable and enjoyable.",1425859200,,387,5.158730158730159

2020932,3,B0001NBMEY,"Great adaptation of Robin Hood. I've seen all Robin Hood films including Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and I'd say this was the most realistic and entertaining Robin Hood I've seen. I enjoyed it more than Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and wondered if this one got overshadowed by Kevin Costner's huge epic remake, but this one left that one in the dust to me. I think Patrick Bergin made a wonderful and charming Robin Hood and Uma Thurman was a tough Maid Marion and the two had wonderful chemistry.

My biggest complaint was not enough romance. Sorry but I wanted to see more sexy moments between Marian and Robin. At times it seemed like their romance was just an after thought.",1420675200,,678,4.557377049180328
2020933,4,B0001NBMEY,"This seems made for less than what the catering fees of the bloated Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe recent takes on the Robin Hood story probably were. Which is OK. It presents a more realistic setting, and a more grimy existance. The four main leads do a thorough acting job, creating believable characters that personify their place in the story. If you accept this for what it is, you will enjoy it. I did.",1420070400,,408,4.527027027027027

2020967,4,B0001NBMEY,this movie came out about the same time as Kevin Custer's Robin Hood Prince of thieves which just seemed very out of place finding this gem late night on cable with a little bit more gray scenery and a little bit more slickness to the characters and actors who play the parts this as love lately many different new looks at Robin Hood legend of is enjoyable to people who might have enjoyed the Showtime series of Robin Hood in the early 80s as opposed to the more colorful and flamboyant and cleaner looking Robin Hood films of the past generations.,1386547200,,550,4.455445544554456
2020968,5,B0001NBMEY,"I like this Robin Hood version Best.  It's more intimate, less grandiose, beautifully designed and filmed, much better cast and acted, and historically more accurate.  Bergen, though older is slim, spry, engaging and handsome; Thurman's lovely, mischievous and intelligent Marion is delightful.

This version is FAR BETTER than Costner's and Crowe's; and though I enjoy the old Errol Flynn/ Olivia DeH film, this version is the one I choose over them all.

2020969,5,B0001NBMEY,Patrick Bergin along with Uma Thurman give convincing performances in this particular version of this famous story. More light-hearted than other movies that cover the Merry Men and more entertaining IMHO.

2020973,3,B0001NBMEY,"There are a few somewhat amusing moments but I doubt the intent of the movie was humor. Maybe it was but it is hard to say. Overall I would recommend against spending much time on it unless you have massive amounts of spare time on you hands, perhaps doing twenty to life.",1366329600,,272,4.25
2020974,5,B0001NBMEY,This version of the old story is my favorite. The characters have life and Robin is his own worst enemy. Dramatic and yet sprinkled with laughs.,1363737600,,144,4.576923076923077

2020980,5,B0001NBMEY,"This is actually my favorite version so far of the old classic... no magic, no special effects... just life the way it really was in medieval times.

2020981,5,B0001NBMEY,"This movie surprised me.  Why? Because so much has been accomplished with so little.  The acting is quite good, and the Medieval-ism is on the whole acceptable.  Purists will find inaccuracies aplenty to be sure, but the fun of this script makes it easy to overlook that.  Really, it's wonderful that it's made it to DVD because I'd really have missed this little Gem.  Everything I wanted ""Prince of Thieves"" to have been, and the comparison will be inevitable as they were released the same year.  Too bad someone didn't swap the reels in the theater, because I'd have sat through this one instead of demanding my money back!",1336262400,,627,4.706422018348624
2020982,2,B0001NBMEY,"Be advised this is a TV movie version released in 1991 therefore the gore, the filth, the raping, the torture, the pillaging and the other potential wonderful things that a Robin Hood story SHOULD have . . . . well let's just say, this isn't that version.  Some writers got together with somebody who had the resources to produce a feature film and decided to start the story with enough meat to grasp onto your interest and then mock the legend of Robin Hood a little, back off to a satire, then mock it some more, and then throw in a bit of adherence to the legend until the viewer isn't sure if they are even watching the same film, but instead four or five genre (serious, satire, comedy, mystery, etc) spliced into a hodgepodge hour and 24 minutes of a tragic waste of my time.  This presentation had the sets, had the costumes, had the quality of actors and actresses, and had everything else necessary besides directing, editing, and continuity of story.  This DVD has English, French or Spanish for language, and subtitles in English or Spanish.  Kudos to Jrgen Prochnow portraying Sir Miles Folcanet, everybody else sucked.  Rumor has it that at least twenty-two minutes of dialogue was cut from this DVD release, and so buyer beware if you're basing your purchase upon seeing this movie elsewhere such as TV or theater.",1336262400,2,1329,4.662393162393163
2020983,5,B0001NBMEY,"What distinguishes this version of Robin Hood: it is more chatty and witty, allowing for better character development.  Other versions have too much action which one cannot follow.  This version also offers a more realistic hypothesis of the legend than other versions I've seen.  The acting is stylized, but good.  In particular, I wanted to see Patrick Bergin in a hero role, after having first seen him in Sleeping with the Enemy, a movie which haunted me for some time.  Jurgen Prochnow also got to shine in the movie, and he's one of my favorite all-time actors. (My favorite movie of all time is DAS BOOT.)

Great ensemble cast.  All the actors performed wonderfully.  You live the movie, and to me that's the criterion for excellence.",1328918400,,741,4.825396825396825
2020984,1,B0001NBMEY,"this ""robin hood"" movie had a mixture of rude sarcasm and at the same time dreariness to it i just didn't get. robin hood is clever,  ill-mannered  and he knows it. some may find it funny - i found the feel to the movie to be barren of any real spirit or even fun though they seem to be trying. maybe this robin hood movie was a reaction to the kevin costner one - i don't know. there is a more  thoughtful side to the robin hood in this movie but it was overridden by him acting like a smart aleck. example; there is a scene where robin hood reveals his secret of shooting the bow to his fellow outlaws by giving them the finger. you see, the secret is in his middle finger. and yes, they laugh. ha ha - i guess?

bottom line; yes, this ""robin hood"" movie was a little different - no problem there, but it just didn't go anywhere for me or leave me with any sense of ... umm, .. well, robin hood.

2020996,3,B0001NBMEY,"I purchased this movie based upon the rave reviews of several subscribers like myself.  They touted the historical accuracy and the authenticity of the film.  And the first time I watched this movie felt a bit cheated.  So I waited a few months and watched it again.  Again the same feeling of betrayal.  Yes, there are some famous stars, Uma Thurman (largely wasted), Jurgen Prochnow (a fine actor but here using a French accent as silly as Peter Sellers' was in the Pink Panther), and Edward Fox (who has great fun in his brief foray as the evil King John), but even they, in my opinion, cannot save this film from more than mediocrity.  The acting is contrived, the dialogue uninteresting and full of platitudes.  Wil Scarlett's constant grins and forced guffaws at the predictable antics of Robin, as well as Robin's ever present facial expressions, relishing his own cleverness, created in me a desire to reach into my television set and tell Wil and Robin to go back to acting school or work with a different director.  And no one likes stupid villians.  This story was full of them.
It is true, the film has a certain authenticity and gritiness.  The scenes largely take place with lots of gray hues and overcast skies.  England can be that way much of the year.  But the costumes and weapons were too obviously machine made, and the people too clean.  And why were John's horsemen wielding those kite shields used by Saxon foot soldiers one hundred years earlier?",1288137600,2,1471,4.69921875
2020997,2,B0001NBMEY,"To me, this was an inferior version of Robin Hood, simply because I couldn't get a handle on the central character and still don't know whether or not I was supposed to take him seriously.  Poor casting for the lead (and, for all I know, equivocal directing).  Much of the film was good, but this spoiled it for me.  (By contrast, Uma Thurman was wonderful as Marion, although it was a pity we didn't get to hear her speak more.)",1281830400,,429,4.3375
2020998,5,B0001NBMEY,"I have seen a few ""Robin Hood"" movies in my lifetime most were good some were silly my favorte is ""The Adventures of Robin Hood."" starring Errol Flynn, Sean Connery's ""Robin and Marion"" is very good (see my review.) But this ""Robin Hood"" is different. The whole movie was filimed in bad or foggy weather save for the very end which IMHO was a plus. It added mood to the movie. The acting was good. Patrick Bergin made a decent Robin Hood not as carismatic as Connery or Flynn but he did a great job. Uma Thurman palyed Marion wonderfully she was not as simpering as De Haviland (The Adventures of Robin Hood) or as serious as Hepburn (Robin and Marion) she was a fiesty Marion a fun loving Marion and if I may be so bold the pretiest I loved one of the lines toward the end of the movie when the villian dying and falling down stairs into a crowd od Robin Hood's followers is greeted by frier Tuck with the words ""welcome to hell!"" a very enjoyable movie.",1279843200,3,955,4.281767955801105
2020999,2,B0001NBMEY,"You have to wonder what goes on in the alcohol and drug addled brains of Hollywood producers that compel  them to re-make classic films. I mean, why not re-make terrible films and turn them into classics. Instead, Hollywood producers take classics and produce terrible re-makes? This brings us to Robin Hood. The 1938 version with Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, et al is a classic.

There will never be a better Robin Hood, a more gracious Marion, nor a better group of merry men. Variations on a theme, like ""Men in Tights"" and ""Robin and Marion"" are welcome additions/extensions, but why on earth would you try to re-make the original?

That brings us to the 1991 TV movie ""Robin Hood"", starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, with Jurgen Prochnow as the bad guy. Now there's nothing wrong with Patrick Bergin who's given us good performances in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" (1991), ""Frankenstein"" (1992), and several other films. But he's no Errol Flynn. Bergin is clumsy with a sword, can barely run, much less fly around on ropes and vines, and his moustache is far too well groomed to be a guy living in a cave.

21 year old Uma Thurman is cute as a button. This was her 7th film and her first starring role. She went on to bigger and better things (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill""), and while her performance is certainly adequate, she has neither the beauty nor the class of Olivia de Havilland. Of course, few actresses do or did.

Jurgen Prochnow is a joke as the evil Frenchman. His accent, when he remembers to use it,  was stolen from an old Peter Sellers movie, and Prochnow too appears clumsy and slow footed, a comic parody of the sleek, villainous Basil Rathbone who dueled with Flynn in several movies, but none better than in Robin Hood. Prochnow is a good actor (""Das Boot"", ""Dune"", ""Air Force One""), but this must stand as one of his worst performances.

There isn't really much to say. The photography is adequate; there is a musical score; there are a host of merry men, but none of them are notable, and Edward Fox's brief cameo as King John looks as painful to Fox as it is to us.

There is absolutely no reason to see this film. Go back to the original, or take a look at ""Robin and Marion"". No other Robin Hood film really merits our attention.

BTW - several reviewers have commented on the ""historical accuracy"" of this film. Duh! It's a legend guys! There was no Robin Hood. And as far as we know, the first mentions of anyone with that name in association with Sherwood is from the reign of King Edward, not Richard.",1278374400,,2560,4.559912854030501
2021000,2,B0001NBMEY,"Ok movie. Uma Thurman was good. Movie was too silly for my taste. Some of the scenes strain credibility. Seems like the director wasn't sure if it should be funny or serious. The blend failed.

2021001,2,B0001NBMEY,"This Robin is older and looks more like a grown up Greg Brady than Robin Hood, and he certainly doesn't look, and isn't, very athletic.  And he is not particularly charming or charismatic.  In short, he isn't my idea of Robin Hood.  That I could forgive if he could act, but he mostly grimaces makng odd faces.  Uma Thurman makes a fine looking maid marian, but her acting, as well as most of the other majors, is horrifically hammy and not very good.  I realize in today's society we do not care or even see good acting much, so it's probably a non issue for most people.  I give an A to the sets and the photography and costumes, of course.  I love the historical accuracy as far as the sets and costumes, but historical accuracy can only take you so far.  I hate to be harsh on the artistic work of anyone, it feels wrong.

But having just seen what is for me, the definitive Robin Hood, the 2006-2009 BBC series, there is no comparison.  The BBC series is probably the most INaccurate production of Robin Hood ever, Robin wears a hoodie, speaks with a perfect Lancashire accent, modern day terms are sprinkled everywhere, Little John can be seen to be wearing jeans, and everything has been made accessible to a modern day audience by design.  In short, before I watched it I was sure I would hate it.  I never thought a TV series so designed would be more enthralling than one that was historically accurate, but it is.

Don't get me wrong, this version isn't terrible, and is certainly better than the simply atrocious Prince of Thieves, but the acting is still not top notch.  No good acting = no believability, historical accuracy nonwithstanding.  I cannot recommend it.",1273190400,,1679,4.53156146179402

2021006,5,B0001NBMEY,"There are various versions of the legend of Robin Hood, and many different retellings on film. Quite simply, this is the best I've seen.
The amazing thing about this, I think, is that it was orginally a made-for-TV movie that came out the same year as Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" a big-budget movie--and is head-and-shoulders better than Costner's ""What English Accent?"" dreck.
The plot is much closer to the original legends (although I'm sure it takes liberties here and there) than most, and is tight and solid.
The acting (not to mention the casting) is first-rate. Patrick Bergin plays Robin Hood with the perfect mix of cunning, bravado, and sense of justice. Uma Thurman as Maid Marian is perfect. She is one of the few actresses that could really pull off playing a young page(sp?) boy convincingly, and still be attractive enough to turn Robin's head. Jrgen Prochnow and Jeroen Krabb are perfect in their supporting roles, bringing their characters to life and saving them from the one-dimensional bad-guy flatness that they could have been.

All and all, an extremely well-made--and fun!--movie.",1255478400,3,1126,5.0864864864864865
2021007,5,B0001NBMEY,"After seeing the earlier charming Errol Flynn versions and the later Kevin Kostner disaster I stumbled onto this version by accident on the Fox Movie Channel one evening and was blown away. Being a student of British medieval history for decades I was first struck by the authenticity of the costumes and settings representing the general period between the 13th and 15th centuries, the era of the earliest written and folklore references to Robin Hood. Unrecorded versions of the legend could have existed even earlier, perhaps the early 1200's or before. Legends usually exist long before they are written down.

The earliest known clear written references appear in Piers the Plowman in the late 1300's. They depict Robin Hood as a yeoman, a commoner of the same approximate social status as an artisan such as a potter, miller, or bow maker. Writers and bards seem to have elevated him to the rank of nobleman much later, at the end of the 16th century, giving him the title of Earl of Huntingdon. A Robert Locksley no doubt existed, but his connection with the much older Robin Hood legend is pure fantasy.

Despite many attempts scholars have been unable to connect Robin Hood with an actual historic person, although the legend might have been originally inspired by an actual person, as is often the case with legends and folklore.

Friar Tuck seems to have existed in seperate legends even earlier than Robin Hood and appears to have been merged into the Robin Hood legend later. The earliest eight or more known Robin Hood written verses make no mention of either Friar Tuck or Maid Marion.

Maid Marion appears later still, in the early 1400's, well after the first known versions of Robin Hood and Friar Tuck appeared together in the same literary contexts.

A definitive and scholarly discussion can be found on-line in Robin Hood, Wikipedia.

The Danny Webb, Conrad Asquith, Barry Stanton, and Patrick Bergin depiction of Robin Hood was produced in the U.K. and is about as authentic as it can get. No cleanly pressed forest green tights and feathered green caps worn on neatly combed hair. The unwashed characters were dressed in appropriately dingy clothes, sometimes almost rags, as real commoners would have been dressed in that period. This is a ""dark"" film until the very last, when it concludes with a beautiful, bright, Art Nuveau ending.

One scene depicted Robin and Marion briefly hiding in the loft of a small peasant house. It was dark and cramped, and the underside of the thatched roof could be seen almost touching their heads, just as it would have been in real life. The streets were muddy and domestic pigs and chickens roamed freely. Medieval celebration and processional costuming was well done in several scenes. There are just too many quality aspects of this film to cover in one evaluation.

The acting was acceptable or better and some of the lines were actually  outstanding. The itenerant bowmaker with his trade cart in which Robin and Marion hid was a good example of well-written and well-delivered lines.

All-in-all, criticisms of deviation from the ""original"" story are totally unfounded because there is no known original story. Over the centuries there have been many versions, none of which can be proven original. This version seems to be an amalgam of the very earliest surviving references to, and ballads of, Robin Hood, with Marion and a rather crude friar folded in for viewers who expect them and feel cheated if they aren't there.

The primary conflict, which most modern formula film scripts demand, is in this instance the conflict between Normans and Saxons, especially between the nobles, rather than between the more traditional Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham, a much later convention. Marion was there to satisfy the other formula requirement for inclusion of a love story.

The film gave me the wonderful experience of witnessing life in 14th century Britain as it actually was. My only criticism is of the ending with the obviously contrived Politically Correct concession of ""we Saxons and Normans must all live in harmony together on this same little island."" ... Blah! ... They might as well have all held hands and sung Koombaya. Other than that it was an excellent movie, well written, well cast, well photographed, well acted, and except for the brief bit of nausious PC dialogue at the end, devoid of any hidden political agenda. Easily the best film version of Robin Hood, and well worth five stars.

This version is muddy, dark, sticky, sweaty, slimy, definitely you smell that everyone needs many bath, several, it gives me some idea that things are unlikely I'll push this era's button when the time machine gets invented, lots of swordplay, pretty fascinating play of Normand versus Saxon. I don't know if one can say it's historically ""accurate' as I read somewhere here. Wasn't this a tale, like a myth? In the movie we follow the telling of that tale and it feels we are at the ground level, as if cameras might be fixed onto the front of the vestments and mics are swinging from the bows. I liked it. You might too. Shoot those bows.

I will tell you I didn't care for saucy smarty mouth Marion but I know THAT'S going to be over ruled by most males that watch.

It goes back to the classic Saxon vs Norman tale that we remember from the old Errol Flynn version. Instead of Prince John as the main villian, we have the noble Baron Brian DeGuerre, Robin's old friend. The interesting twist of the story and why it is so realistic compared to the others is the fact that at first, Robin is not waging some kind of guerilla war against the Norman overlords. No, he is just surviving as an outlaw. The reason he gives to the poor is to prevent them from selling him out. His motivations and his decisions are based in the gritty realism of this medieval world. Also of note, is Uma Thurman's protrayal of Marion, DeGuerre's niece. She is not the victim or prize that the previous Marion's have been. She, well, watch the movie and see for yourself. Like the mini-series Invanhoe, this movie shows more of how the medieval world really was without the whole modern perspective of ""free men"" and social equality being thrown in. The ending is a little trite, but overall the movie is a great adventure escape. Patrick Bergin is a charming Robin Hood and does a great job in the title role.

This is far better although I personally feel that Bergin's lack of charisma ultimately holds the film back. Not that he is that bad, he's just never more than ok and doesn't do any justice at all to the role. Too many contrived grins and unconvincing acting. For me if you are doing Robin Hood it has to have the feel of an epic, of a great story. It has to have that larger than life quality. After all this is supposed to be the birth of a LEGEND. Otherwise what you're left with is ..... this - a worthy effort, but no pizzazz! On the plus side, there are a lot of great moments and I loved the sense of the period that we are shown. The change from Robert Hode to Robin Hood is brilliantly done and the forest scenes are all atmospheric. As another reviewer said it is a great prequel to Robin & Marian. I enjoyed the movie because I love the whole Robin Hood genre and if you are a Robin Hood fan then if you come across this film I recommend seeing it. But of course if you REALLY want to see a truly magnificent Robin Hood film it has to be the Erroll Flynn version which is exactly how to do it. That is a masterpiece of cinema. Now I read another reviewer say that Peter Jackson should direct a Robin Hood film. Now that would be worth waiting for. Since I wrote this review the Russell Crowe version has been released.

I am going to blame a weak script full of trite lines and stereotypes and juvenile direction.  The editing could not have helped.  There is very little sense of time to give any air of legend. Every character just happens to bump into each other one year and, poof!!! instant heroes. There is little sense of Norman and England's native cultures.  I love a good story and am willing to experience a different perspective in the telling.  There was little, except some eyecandy in the person of Patrick Bergin, to make me care about Robin Hood. I like Uma Thurman, but she blew one note through whole thing: the sassy bride.  There was one moment at the end that engaged my imagination as to what the meaning of the story was.  The arc the characters and the story follow ends abruptly. The fighting is lousy. Only King John's story and actors showed any subtlety.  I was begging for at least some mention of Richard the Lionhearted just to make it more interesting.

I have seen all sorts of wonderful and varied interpretations of the Arthurian legends, but I have yet to be satisfied that anybody has really taken a risk to tell a compelling tale of Robin Hood - actually Daffy Duck as Robin and Porky Pig  as Friar Tuck.  Errol Flynn was the best on film. It seemed like they wanted to make a grander movie but only had the resources for an hour and a half when they should have tried to invest a little more in the writing and create a good miniseries.

2021034,5,B0001NBMEY,"Patrick Bergin's Robin Hood is a drunken nobleman who is basicly a fool with a good heart whose vanity and pride are the cause of his undoing yet ultimately lead to his redemption.

Costner and Flynn are basic heroic  two dimensional fools.

It begins with our fool preventing a man from having his eyes put out not because he feels sympathy for the man but because the guy who wants to do it (big bad Procknow who's the Law Enforcer) is violating our fool's Turf.

This gets him into deep trouble which a symple apology might have saved him from but PRIDE gets in the way and gets him outlawed.

He hooks up with a band of bandits merely to obtain shelter. He becomes a bandit and their leader as a means to Get Even with Procknow and his associates. Robs them blind which make him very popular with the peasants who are being taxed (Government's way of legally doing what the bandits are doing). And slowly starts to grow into the heroic role. His good heart causes him to rescue two small boys form being hanged not for a crime but to intimidate information from the peasants. His good heart (and Will Scarlet's prodding) cause him to start returning the taxed money to the peasants.

Watching him develope is a joy. (Costner and Flynn don't give  us this).  Meeting the other characters is a treat. Friar Tuck is a fun character to watch. He's a crook selling 'relics' to survive but does not forget his religious duties.  And the Ending is a joy.

  The only thing I would hold against this version is the final fight with Patrick Bergin and Jergin Prochnow at Marian's'(Uma's) wedding.  Not a very convincing fight sequence.  I was not expecting a lightsaber fight like in star wars III but they could have done something better than what they did.

2021036,5,B0001NBMEY,"If you have your choice between Costner's Robin Hood and Bergin's, pick Bergin's. I had never seen the movie before until I picked up the DVD and was immediately glad I had. Costner's Prince of Thieves is a good action movie, but lacks a heart. Bergin's Robin Hood is much less high flown and much more satisfying. The story is grittier, the characters better drawn, and the actors appear to be having the time of their lives. The first thing I thought when I saw the film was that screenwriters certainly knew their Robin Hood ballads. There's a false Marian, a disguised Marian, a Green Man, the Norman/Saxon conflict, the band lives in caves rather than treehouses, Nottingham is a textile town (part of the action takes place in a dyer's shop), and Robin himself resorts to disguises and the help of his outlaw band rather than a great deal of derring-do. None of the characters is particularly black or white. They are all portrayed as shades of gray, even the heavies, which makes the action of the story more realistic. In particular, Jeroem Krabbe gives a nuanced performance as Marian's Norman uncle. Uma Thurman, whom I'm not particularly a fan of, is especially luminous on screen. Her character has a great deal of backbone, much more than the usual ""distressed damsel"" role the character is usually relegated to. Even with her back to the wall, Marian still refuses to marry the man her uncle has picked out for her. Uma also looks quite convincing dressed as a boy. Patrick Bergin's Robin is a fair man and a cheeky fellow, but is also overly proud and impulsive. My overall recommendation: buy it. You'll be glad you did.",1129680000,6,1636,4.70383275261324

Its actions scenes are exciting and fun, with nearly bloodless violence, making it suitable for family viewing. It has few pretensions beyond being a light-weight adventure flix, but accomplishes that very well.
As this `Robin Hood' came out the same year as Kevin Costner's Robin Hood project, it is hard not to compare them, and Irvin's `Robin Hood' is superior in nearly every way. It is a travesty that Costner's bomb received all the publicity while this far better movie disappeared into obscurity. . Its chief virtue is its fine cast, led by Uma Thurman in one of her best performances as a fiery Maid Marian, and Patrick Bergin, who captured and owned the title role of Robin Hood as no one else has since the great Errol Flynn. Thurman and Bergin struck real sparks together, giving some life and zip to the romance between Robin and Marian. . Jeff Nuttall created a brilliant Friar Tuck, and Owen Teale and David Morrissey both turned in fine performances as Will Scarlett and Little John.
`Robin Hood' is fast paced, exciting and creative. Its action is fun, and its romance sizzles. It may fall short of being a great or memorable film, but it is certain to entertain you and your whole family.

Bergin acts more like a spoiled teenager making stupid insults that are bound to get him in trouble (who wrote this thing...6th graders?).  On the positive side, the costumes were nice and the horses looked good.  But for me, I'll pull out my old video of Errol Flynn's ""Adventures of Robin Hood""; corny and dated, but it sure is good entertainment.",1110585600,5,721,4.645669291338582
2021040,1,B0001NBMEY,"I'll save my time and suggest you to read the other ""one star"" review of this movie.

I agree that the best portrayal in motion pictures of Robin Hood was the british tv series ""Robin of Sherwood"". But the best presentation of Robin's legend I read in grammar school. I wish I could remember the title or the author, but it was the best adventure book I have ever read. It showed the whole story of Robin Hood as teenage boy who became a an outlaw for killing a deer to his most wonderfully depicted death.

This movie is a primitive. In one scene there was a soldier who threw a big rock, that probably weights like half a ton, off the stairs as if it was a basketball. If this movie was true, there would be no legend of Robin Hood and it seemed at times it was made to mock that very person. (But perhaps it's about Robin Hode, not Hood?)

I wouldn't even recommend this movie for the kids on saturday morning.",1109376000,4,913,4.2057142857142855
2021041,5,B0001NBMEY,"A Robin Hood film with a talented lead, excellent supporting actors, and an actual feeling of ""being there,"" this Robin Hood flick is simply fun.  Bergin is the perfect trickster-like Robin, Thurman is the first Marian with a spine and a brain in years, and the supporting cast populate a medieval England complete with mud and overcast skies.  The classic plot actually feels fresh, and while the final confrontation between Hood and Falconet might not match the Errol Flynn (nothing can), it definitely gives it a better run for the money than has been managed in a very long time.  The true genius of the castle invasion gives the film a trickster quality, and overall it has some of the best one-liners ever.  While not overtly/annoyingly political, it does manage to send a firm message whilst maintaining a great plot with a fine cast.  As Will Scarlet says, ""Give me back my country!""",1108684800,2,891,4.7973856209150325
2021042,5,B0001NBMEY,"This film is one of the best RH films done it certainly is far superior to the joke that Costner did!
I do have a correction that is pretty important, there is no Sherriff of Nottingham or Guy of Gisborne in this version. The Director chose to use the conflict of Norman Vs Saxon as the stronger plot drive and instead had two noble Normans playing the heavys. While it was a surprise to me the first time I watched the film I understood the choice. It makes it much easier for veiwers to see what was the actual conflict of Robin Hood, and not have too many people thinking of Alan Rickman or Basil Rathbone's potrayals of the heavys from the two more well known versions of RH.
Worth seeing, far more historically acurate than either of the other films and Uma's Marion could go head to head with Oliva's and  totaly wipeout MEM from Prince of Thieves, or as I call it Robin Hood: Dances With Arrows.",1089763200,41,902,4.337278106508876

2021058,4,B0001NBMEY,"Yes I agree with the majority of reviews on this site but the fact that every one is missing is that the DVD version has been cropped by close to 10 full minutes.  This editing centers around Friar Tucks interaction with the bishop. It has all been edited out of the DVD print.  It is iritating that the scene in which Friar tuck kills the Bishop is missing along with his quote of, "" Don't leave now, Not without your 30 pieces of silver!""
Other than removing some of the pagan over tones and sanatizing this copy so it does not upset the x-stians, well I have no other complaints.  Still due to the hack job I'll only rate it a 4.",1088380800,3,632,4.163934426229508
2021059,4,B0001NBMEY,"First let me say tht I'm a Kevin Costner fan. I prefer Wyatt Earp to Tomestone and have actually watched Waterworld from beginning to end (perhaps the only person ever to have done this!). Nonetheless, this gritty version of the RH story is second only to Robin and Marian (think, Sean Connery as Robin Hood!) as the best. Uma Thurman was (more or less) unknown when this was made (well, I didn't know her anyway...) and Patrick Bergen remains unknown (again, this is only so far as I know...). But together they make a degree of music not seen with my bud, Kevin's version of the tale.
Early on in this film, there is a confrontation between Robin and a team of the sherrif's men. It sets the stage in a way that Kevin's confrontation in the Middle East just doesn't make. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth your dollar - if you want to enjoy a darker Robin Hood (and Uma Thurman).",1085011200,2,886,4.441717791411043
2021060,5,B0001NBMEY,"I keep watching for people to do it right when it comes to film adaptations of classics.  For example, there has still never been a great ""Tarzan"" movie, but they got it as right at anyone could when they put together the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and the A&E ""Hornblower"" series is top-notch.  What do those have to do with this version of ""Robin Hood""?
THEY GOT ROBIN HOOD RIGHT!  The setting, the dress, the hygiene, the politics, the action, and the characters are all spot on.  Sure some people wonder about casting Bergin in this role, but he does an awesome job throughout, with just the right combination of panache, bravado, and, at the same time, reliance on friends and sometimes enemies to pull off being Robin Hood.
I particularly appreciated the muted colors throughout the movie followed by the breaking of spring at the end as the story's political and interpersonal conflicts are resolved.
Now to wrap this review up, I have watched this movie 20+ times, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  It's a staple of my collection.  If you are like me, and you like smart (though not necessarily glitzy) action films, then this movie might be for you, too!
5 - stars, no question (and I don't give 5 stars to just any movie) -- ARH",1084838400,7,1251,4.5625
2021061,5,B0001NBMEY,"Some people enjoy the Kevin Costner-Alan Rickman version of the Robin Hood legend, with its treehouses, American stars (faking horrendous Brit accents), Sean Connery cameo and even a wicked-witch-in-the-cellar.  I am not one of those people.
This Bergin-Irving ""unknown"" version was released a few months before the Costner version.  Sadly, it aired only on television for fear of competing with the star-filled, ""event"" film.  And yet, this smaller film is vastly superior to the big-budget Costner ""epic"" on every single level.
This is a somewhat different version of the legend than what you saw with Costner and Disney.  The political background to this tale matters: the uneasiness between the two peoples of England.  It involves the Saxons, who had held power for centuries, and the more recent arrival and comeuppance of the French-based Normans.  Basically, the Normans are now taking power in England and they're not being too nice to the displaced Saxons.
Early in the film we meet two noblemen who are friends: Baron Daguerre (played superbly by Jeroen Krabbe of ""The Fugitive"") as the Norman lord of the local province and Sir Robert Hode, a Saxon landowner.  Soon, however, Daguerre's aide-de-camp, the brutal knight Sir Miles Falconey (Jurgen Prochnow in another great performance) gets into a tiff with Hode.  Hode openly rebels against his former friend (Daguerre) and what follows is a neat retelling of the Robin Hood legend - replete with cross-dressing Uma Thurman as Maid Marian.
This film is beautifully scripted and wonderfully shot.  The costumes, acting, and sets feel gritty and authentic.  In other words, this is not a Hollywood production.  It is simply a great film that nobody saw.  I am ecstatic that is coming to DVD.",1083024000,5,1751,5.148409893992933

2021063,5,B0001NBMEY,"Patrick Bergin is a dynamic Robin Hood, hitting the mark with the perfect mix of arrogance, compassion, charm and devil-may-care, hell-bent glory-seeking. Sure, there's a list of noble reasons why Robin Hood takes to the forest to fight Norman oppression and protect the unfortunate Saxon serfs from tyranny. But let's face it, Robin is a hero who enjoys what he does. He loves nothing more than laughing at danger and tweaking the nose of authority. It's easy to see that Bergin enjoyed the part, and his pleasure translates to the screen, making it an enjoyable romp for viewers.
Bergin shares Sherwood with a fine cast. Uma Thurman is a surprisingly strong Marian. Owen Teale is an excellent, fun-loving Will Scarlett, and David Morrissey is the best Little John I've seen yet. Jeff Nuttall is also a picture-perfect Friar Tuck. On the Norman side, Jurgen Prochnow is the malicious knight, Sir Miles Folcanet, who pursues Robin through the forest, and Jeroen Krabbe is Baron Daguerre, a greedy lord with a conscience. There's a brief, but impressive, appearance of Edward Fox as the would-be King John.
The movie boasts excellent swordplay, good costuming, authentic-sounding accents ... and some great pagan symbolism.
This film also has immense respect for the history behind the legend. While we may not know much about the real Robin Hood -- if there even was one -- we do know a lot about the time period in question, and Irvin keeps his cameras focused on the truth of feudal Britain. This is a Robin Hood I can believe in without reservation.",1057708800,59,1552,4.904942965779468

In response, the Saxon hero takes up with a band of robbers, organizing them in an effort to remove Deguerre and the other villainous Normans from power. The barons niece is a feisty Maid Marion (Uma Thurman) who isn't afraid of a little swordplay.
