First time director Boyask keeps the action coming thick and fast.

It's funny script, solid acting and dramatic storyline keep you entertained when the action lets go...

4530121,5,B000A3XY64,"A gut wrenching bad ass brit flick that sets a whole new standard for Digital Video production; Left For Dead, combines quirky dialogue with dazzling action choreography that far exceeds it's budgetary limitations.

Set in the crime ridden city of, `Hope', Left For Dead tells the tale of Ben Williams, henchman to the sadistic gangster, `Kincaid'. After two long years Williams is tired of all the killing and other brutal activities in which he is involved, thus he decides to leave his life of crime behind...but no one ever leaves! Kincaid orders his best men, Dylan and Taylor to `remove' Williams from the scene. They attack and Williams is `Left For Dead'! Fortunately he escapes and makes his way to a back street surgeon who helps the beaten, bullet wounded and poisoned `anti-hero' on his road back to health.

Meanwhile, Danny Kelso, a promising young kickboxer has also felt the wrath of, `Kincaid'. When the talented Martial Artist refuses to throw a fight, his hands are broken by the psychopathic, Taylor. Ordered to leave the city, Kelso too visits, `The Surgeon'.

After several months of training Kelso reluctantly teams up with Williams to take on the criminal underworld of Hope with death or revenge their only option! And so, the fight-fest finale of Left For Dead ensues with a satisfying barrage of brutal and bloody Martial Arts action that is second to none.

Brought to the screen by UK based production company, `Modern Life?', Producer, Phil Hobden and Director/Editor, Ross Boyask have been more than successful in their quest to create `genre' cinema on location in England. Any fight fans tired of the relentless, mind numbing period dramas, that Britain so fondly generates should welcome Left For Dead with open arms!

Whilst, the cast and crew of Left For Dead are all virtually unknown, readers of Martial Arts magazines and genre websites, will recognise a few familiar names. Firstly, the awesome high kicking hitman, Williams is portrayed by Glenn Salvage. A veteran actor of over ten years Salvage is well known in the Martial Arts and film-making community. Bringing the role of Williams to life, Salvage sets the screen ablaze and quite frankly makes such on-screen heroes as Steven Seagal look ready for retirement.

Hard hitting, Andy Prior plays, Kelso and is no doubt a big talent to watch out for in the action film industry. The final battle of Left For Dead sees Andy pulling off some full throttle Hong Kong inspired moves without the aid of a stuntman or a bunch of wires to help him take flight!

Both Salvage and Prior are relentless in their roles and provide good strong and believable lead characters. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about all cast members and whilst bad guys Taylor and Dylan behold a vast array of hilarious one liners they aren't always delivered with the necessary talent to make then convincing. Also, the action featuring these guys at times seems slow and powerless. That said, give writer and star Adrian Foiadelli, (Taylor) a baseball bat and he quickly transforms into one mean son of a bitch!

At the other end of the spectrum, whilst the film is by no means an exercise in character development there are a few roles that maybe should have been extended, such as the appearance of producer PL Hobden as Boxing promoter, `Rourke' and the on-screen action featuring Cecily Fay as `Vixen'. Fay has all the right moves, looks fantastic and would make a great addition to the `Battling Babes' genre of action cinema. `Vixen' should definitely have seen more screen time!

In conclusion, Left For Dead, even with it's bad points lays the smack down on the competition and whilst America is currently producing a vast selection of Digital Video schlock, thanks to the cast and crew of Left For Dead, (even Vicki Vilas) Britain, for the first time in history is at the forefront of cutting edge action cinema. Now that is one hell of an achievement!

Make no mistake, Left For Dead is the real deal and the UK movie scene just got it's ass kicked! Grindhouse cinema welcomes a new dawn, Tarantino is the champion, Hobden and Boyask are the underdogs, but Left For Dead is just the beginning!",1124409600,9,4175,4.859353023909986
4530122,3,B000A3XY64,"I saw this movie in Cannes and I thought it really kicked butt! It was a bit too long and sometimes drifts into comedy, but overall it was great stuff. The fight scenes are nicely shot and edited and they just keep going and going (which is what you want isn't it?). Fans of the genre have a treat in store for them. Get this one while you can and you can say that you spotted these guys first before everyone else jumps on the bandwagon!",1123545600,7,438,4.104651162790698
8453987,1,B000A3XY64,This was not at all what I expected...this is very much like a movie that even the $1 theater would turn down,1430006400,,109,4.0
8453988,4,B000A3XY64,"In the fictional city of Hope the notorious gangster Kincaid (Adam Chapman) is king. Ruling the underworld with an iron fist, and with an army of trained enforcers at his call - nothing and no one stands in his way.

One of his top men is Williams (Glenn Salvage) a hardened mercenary, left emotionally hollow after the death of his wife, he carries out Kincaid's punishments with ruthless efficiency and unquestioning loyalty. That is, until one day, he discovers that Kincaid has set him up whilst on a job and consequently decides to defy him - big mistake. For his transgression Williams suffers unspeakable violence at the hands of one of Kincaid's other henchmen - the psychotic Taylor (Adrian Foiadelli) and, as the title goes, is left for dead. Upon recovery he meets Kelso (Andy Prior) who had a promising boxing career cut short by Kincaid after he refused to throw a rigged fight and subsequently had his hands smashed by him. Deciding that enough is enough the two join forces and hatch a plan to bring Kincaid and his organisation to its knees  - let battle commence!

Privately funded by cult action director Ross Boyask and produced by award winning filmmaker Phil Hobden, Left For Dead was made over a period of two years and finally secured a limited UK cinema run in 2004 and a wide DVD release earlier this year after a very successful debut at the Cannes film festival.

So what of the film itself? Well as far as action goes any self-respecting film fan will not be disappointed. Both Prior and the incredibly versatile Salvage display martial arts skills that would give Bruce and Jet a run for their money. Both do all their own stunts and make the fantastic fight sequences that much more real by seemingly appearing to actually connect with every punch and kick that they throw. Of note is the superbly choreographed car park dust up and the brilliantly wince-inducing ass kicking finale played out in Kincaid's lair.

In addition Boyask's direction shows a sure hand and his camerawork is, at times very inventive indeed, making good use of silhouettes and shadows to create a real 'Sin City' kind of feel to the film. Foiadelli's writing is inspired, injecting a nice sense of black humour to proceedings that makes one fondly remember the salad days of Tarantino and Shane Black.

There are some areas that could of been improved though. Notably in the editing. There are a few scenes that go on far too long and could have done with trimming by a few minutes. Also its way too violent in places and in some areas goes completely over the top in some of its brutality.

Performance wise its a bit of a mixed bag - Salvage is impressive as the hero and can certainly deliver a decent one liner on cue, Prior is a tad wooden and certainly needs some acting lessons, Foiadelli isn't bad as the sadistic nutter Taylor - but could of benefited from reigning in allot of his madman screaming and swearing, and been a tad more on the subtle side to boot - cant fault him for effort though. Chapman is the standout however, chillingly effective as Kincaid, bad to the bone, and so damn nasty that throughout I found myself desperately willing Salvage to get his revenge over him when they meet in the films incredible 'fists at dawn' denouement - which frankly has to be seen to be believed.

So overall I found 'Left For Dead' a highly enjoyable movie. Yes its a bit rough round the edges, but it exhibits a refreshing rawness (rare in films today) that superbly adds to the dark atmosphere that Boyask and Hobden have created. Fair play to the lads, as they've shown some serious balls here, it takes allot to make a movie in this day and age and to have done such a professional job as they have here gives me allot of hope for the future of British action cinema.

Highly recommended",1133913600,2,3807,4.611521418020679
8453989,4,B000A3XY64,"Independently produced, low-budget movies exist for several reasons. They act as a jumpstart for fledgling talent. They offer something for a niche audience that's not deemed suitable for mass consumption. They push film convention to extremes. Encompassing all of these traits is Left for Dead, one hell of an action movie that gives the people what they want and what the people want is more guns, more swordplay, more high-kicking martial arts, and more bloody mayhem all around.

The movie is wall-to-wall gritty and politically incorrect gunplay and martial arts violence that amazingly holds together as a decent crime drama, which is what Britain's mainstream film industry continues to excel at (see Layer Cake, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead). It all begins in a whirl of action in ""Hope City"" as a simple, but messy job performed by several hitmen to take out a minor league player in the city's organized crime scene turns into a desperate manhunt for one of their own. For reasons that become clear as the story develops, Ben Williams (Glen Savage) is deemed expendable by his employer, local crime boss Kincaid (Adam Chapman). Kincaid's top henchmen, a pair of cold-blooded maniacs named Dylan (Kevin Akehurst) and Taylor (Adrian Foiadelli) turn on their former associate. Wounded, Ben goes into hiding.

Meanwhile, a promising kickboxer named Danny Kelso (Andy Prior), whom Kincaid hopes to control, refuses to throw a fight. Taylor, his one-time friend breaks every one of his fingers and sends Danny into exile in a neighboring city. Over the next six months Danny recovers and revives his kickboxing career, while waiting for an opportunity to get revenge on Taylor.

Having uncovered the truth about why he first came to work for Kincaid, Ben shows up and convinces Danny to join him in returning to Hope City to take down not only Taylor, but Kincaid and his entire underworld empire.

I'd like to think that the only thing holding this film back is money or the lack thereof. The modest locations, lighting, sound, attempts at computerized bloodletting, and generally uneven art direction are all reminders that this is budget filmmaking. But the movie compensates for this in the areas the matter with heavy doses of gleeful carnage, serviceable acting and some fine direction and editing. The biggest problem with low budget actioners from inexperienced filmmakers is usually pacing. Writer/director Ross Boyask and his crew nail this down with few hitches. The movie flies by as the viewer is thrust into one ugly brawl after another. The movie may move a little too fast at times, but fans of Hong Kong cinema will feel right at home.

The opening sets the tone. It's a long and violent action sequence that begins as a shootout and transforms into a martial arts brawl with swords, fists and feet mincing bodies. It's not the best action sequence in the film and is marred by some discordant editing that makes it look more like a highlight reel. This choppy look returns towards the end as Ben and Danny storm Kincaid's headquarters. My opinion is that they left too much in and should have pared both sequences down to their essentials.

Once done with the extended opener, the film settles more comfortably into its crime genre leanings by fleshing out the story and characters. Unlike most action movies shot at this level, I actually took an honest interest in the story and found the characters, although somewhat derivative, enjoyable to watch. Reminiscent of Robert Carlyle, as the explosive Begbie in Trainspotting, Adrian Foiadelli makes the most of his killer-gone-over-the-edge persona. His final scene in the film is very nicely done. As his partner in crime, Kevin Akehurst isn't quite as convincing in his role, but handles his dialogue well. He also gets to share in one of the film's better stand-alone fight sequences when he faces off against Glen Savage on a rooftop with sword in hand. Savage is a great choice for the film's slow-boiling lead. He's got everyman looks and an unpretentious manner that is wholly believable when cast as someone who means business. There's also something in his eyes that speaks volumes. I'm glad to see that he's continuing to star in subsequent UK actioners such as The Silencer and Boyask's Devil's Run.

One disappointment story-wise, is the confusing introduction of an attractive platinum blonde during a montage sequence. She appears to be Ben's replacement as one of Kincaid's newest fighters. We get a scintillatingly short fight towards the end between her and Ben where she shows off some uniquely-acrobatic fighting skills. But there's no character development of any kind to give her fight any meaning.

A lot of work obviously went into the martial arts sequences in this film, which were put together and shot with members of several British stunt teams including First Strike Action Team, Independent Stunts and Screenfighter UK. The types of combat used are varied, but dominated by high kicking. Personally, I have a problem with high kicking put to use in a supposedly gritty crime film as many self-defense practitioners would probably agree that throwing your leg up above the waist leaves you wide open to a world of hurt. But, as Hong Kong producer Ng See-yuen discovered with The Secret Rivals (1976), leg fighting onscreen sells because it looks good. Andy Prior gets the lion's share of leg work to perform as the kickboxing hero, both in the ring and out. He's not the next Hwang Jang-lee, but he's alright.

Genre fans should appreciate some of the more creative aspects of the fight choreography that works its way into the film. Towards the end, some tandem fighting appears as two stunt actors coordinate their attacks against Prior. Viewers will also witness the use of locks, takedowns and good old fashioned kung fu sparring. There's even some gory Street Fighter-type bodily alterations performed on opponents. With the sheer volume of fighting that takes place in the movie, the stunt teams are able to work in quite a bit of variety. Even so, this starts to work against them, for the action scenes linger long enough to begin to lose their ""punch."" The amount or fighting isn't the real problem here. It's just limited clarity, dynamics and the ability to manipulate the scenes for full dramatic impact, all of which tend to come with experience on everyone's part.

Although not without faults, I've got to hand it to the folks behind Left for Dead. They've created a monster of an action movie considering their limited means. Most importantly, they've managed to make the most out of their medium, the indie film, by pushing the action to extremes while maintaining an engaging plot. Left for Dead is like a modern, British equivalent of a Shinji Fukazaku yakuza thriller and classic Hong Kong kung fu movie in one, where the violence is intense and the fighting practically never stops.

8453990,5,B000A3XY64,"In the opening scene of `Left for Dead' the low budget roots of this homegrown, self-funded British action film are painfully obvious. Thankfully the ambition and love of the genre that the filmmakers have clearly injected into the project are infectious and within minutes all its flaws are forgotten. With its straight-forward, engaging revenge storyline and numerous energetic and accomplished fight scenes `Left for Dead' is a kick in the head for a genre that has come to rely too heavily on special effects and wire-work. Few filmmakers at this level of funding would even attempt to make such an elaborate, time-consuming and large-scale project, especially in a country in which genre films in general are a rarity, but the finished film stands as a testament to their success. The spirit and inventiveness of this back-to-basics action film puts some of the most expensive and explosive blockbusters to shame and needs to be seen to be believed.",1132444800,2,954,5.082802547770701
8453991,4,B000A3XY64,"I've now watched this film twice and for a low budget action flick, it presses all the right buttons. The intro graphics and titles draw you in nicely, good start. Then the film begins and it's non-stop action, gun fights, swords, bats, motor bikes, martial arts, electrocution,  and this is only the first twenty minutes !

The camerawork and the editing are very well done, good camera angles, nice cuts between scenes. I liked the chapter breaks, the graphics when travelling between the two cities, the humour throughout the film, the interspersed cut scenes. There were a lot of really nice touches of black humour that acted as a good contrast to the violence. The acting was sometimes a little stilted, but the manic expressions on some of the characters (especially Dylan and Taylor) gave the characters some real personality.  The plot itself is, like all good martial arts films, a saga of revenge. The story flows smoothly, leaving the viewer in no doubt about what is going on.

The martial arts scenes were generally very well choreographed, and there is enough diversity of moves to make it a worthwhile watch for anyone interested in martial arts. Actually, there's a hell of a lot of fight scenes in this film, you certainly get your money's worth ! If you're an intense action/martial arts flick aficionado you will love this film. If the sight of blood and violence turns your stomach... best steer clear.",1130716800,2,1423,4.843621399176954
8453992,4,B000A3XY64,"Can a British crew make an action film with Hong Kong sensibilities? Watch Left for Dead and you'll see.

In the vicious city Hope, Kincaid is the boss. He rules with an iron fist and employs soldiers with lethal martial arts skills to make sure no-one encroaches into his territory. Williams is Kincaid's best hit-man. His wife was brutally killed years ago and rage used to fuel his jobs but now William's feels empty and wishes to leave this lifestyle behind. He agrees to do one last job but Kincaid can not let him retire. At the end of the mission his two colleagues, Dylan and Taylor, turn on him and try to finish him off. Needless to say, they leave him for dead. Kelso is a professional kickboxer who's life is ,ruined when he defies Kincaid and doesn't throw a fight. Forced to leave Hope his only way to make a living is to get involved in illegal bare knuckle fights. Williams soon discovers it was Kincaid who ordered his wife to be killed and decides he wants pay back. He teams up with Kelso and the two go back to Hope to get revenge.

Left for Dead is a guilty pleasure. Its one of those films that shouldn't be any good but something makes you enjoy it. Its got a few flaws; the story is a bit clichd, some of the acting is a bit woolly, the editing is a bit choppy with continuity being a bit sparse in some places and it's a little too long with some of the action being a bit repetitive.

But its still a really enjoyable film.

All its flaws can be forgiven as soon as you find out Left For Dead was only made for 10,000. It looks a bit scrappy but it easily looks like it was made for 10 times that amount.

If you're looking for an action film that's stuffed full of Martial Arts, good stunts and is made by some home-grown talent then Left For Dead is the film for you.",1130371200,2,1795,4.2063953488372094

But don't be put off... this is a funny, action packed (oh god so much action, my head hurt by the end of this film) low-budget epic... this is what us Brits call 'a beer and curry' movie.

Meaning?  On a Saturday night you get a beer, a curry, sit in front of the TV and switch off.  And by that standard there are few better films...

If this was the 80's this would have been banned... infact I'm not sure that it shouldn't be now.

In total the death toll was well over 150... it makes Commando took like the Telly Tubbies!  People get their heads chopped off and almost every 10 minutes there is another fight scene with another 20 deaths.
