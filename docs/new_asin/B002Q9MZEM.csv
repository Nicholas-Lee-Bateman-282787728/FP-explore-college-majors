3966583,5,B002Q9MZEM,NOVA is the best science program I know. The advantage of  it streaming through Amazon is that I can pause the program and continue after I got a refill.,1362528000,,153,4.275862068965517
3966584,4,B002Q9MZEM,"Could not 5 Star because not all programs are appealing subjects to me. But the ones that are rate 5's. Example is the one about all things PLUTO the ex-planet. And there are many like that... Presented in the entertaining but educational way that is heavy on neither end of that. There are a few that while the subject was appealing, the ""drama"" used to present was too much for me. That's just me; the rating is secure: 4 to solid 5. ~ww",1362441600,,439,4.301204819277109
3966585,1,B002Q9MZEM,"My kids and I watched this together. It was pretty decent up until near the end when the guy started putting his personal ""global warming"" propaganda in. There hasn't been any warming in almost 18 years!  We need to keep politics OUT of science. I'd have given it 4 stars otherwise.",1361145600,,282,4.529411764705882
3966586,4,B002Q9MZEM,"Not only is the Hubble's Amazing Rescue another tour de force example of Nova's superlative and award winning programs; this is a ripping good story. Sure there's rocket scientists discussing important things and mind blowing photos worthy of Star Trek but Houston there are problems.  The Hubble is twenty years old, it has had numerous fixes but now there are no longer parts for the antique technology it is carrying.  Now imagine doing these complicated repairs and replacements in a vacuum, hanging upside down, no store to run to. And did we mention the odds of death for everyone involved is very high  The mission was postponed for two years because of the danger and expense. But brave, talented and brilliant people pulled together and saved a great scientific masterpiece of the 20th century from blindness as death and allowed us to continue searching the heavens.  For once the overused word amazing is really what is called for here. The program is 58minutes made up of the following scenes: An Icon in Trouble, Pooling Talents, Stuck in Space, First Repairs in Orbit, Bad Bolt, and the last Waltz. There is also the option of Director's commentary and video description. Buckle up, your students will enjoy the ride and learn a lot.
Recommended Grades 6-12.

3966587,5,B002Q9MZEM,"Until I saw this documentary, I had no idea of the extent of the work that needed to be done to the Hubble Telescope. I think it's incredible that they were able to do what they did to not only repair it, but to enhance it. The sheer number of variables to consider, the things that could go wrong, it was amazing that it went right.

You get to see the testing of the procedures on Earth. From the beginning, they had a lot of odds stacked against them (i.e. the designers of the Hubble had passed away so they had to rely on any notes and files that they had). Obstacle after obstacle came about but remarkably, was overcome (shows the incredible power of the human will). The amount of stress that was on the engineers and the astronauts is not something I would wish on someone I considered distasteful. This is a great documentary and well worthwhile if you have any interest in this kind of thing.",1276560000,3,903,4.34319526627219
3966588,5,B002Q9MZEM,"At first this starts relatively slow with descriptions of why Hubble. Then we learn about space shuttle problems tool problems and many other problems that need to be faced before we can even start face the problems with replacing parts on the Hubble. At one point, the Hubble was going to be scrapped.

Soon the pace picks up or you get so interested in it that you do not notice the difference and pacing. The story is actually told by the people that did the work.

The version I watched has spectacular views and was on a big screen television however it was not Blu-Ray.

The scenes include:
An Icon in Trouble
Pooling Talents
Stuck in Space
First Repairs in Orbit
A Bad Bolt
The Last Waltz

3966589,5,B002Q9MZEM,"Just saw this Nova episode on PBS but it won't be available on amazon.com until January 2010, and it was astounding.  Photographic quality is first-rate, images from the telescope/camera are gorgeous, and you really do get to know many of the people involved - those who perform the miracles on the ground and in space.

I give the ""plot"" my highest praise:  this is better than ""Ice Road Truckers.""  And even though I knew the outcome of the project, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire program.  The whole repair job depends on every tiny little detail, including 150 screws, each of which could ruin the project if the head is stripped... and you know how easily that happens.

Humor, pathos, outstanding teamwork and creativity... I could - and will - watch this again.  The only question left unanswered was how the astronauts go to the bathroom in their spacesuits during an eight-hour spacewalk (I couldn't help it - I'm a retired middle school teacher).",1255392000,13,973,4.72189349112426

Get what the priests want and crave? Aromatic Incense? Do you really believe the story of five oceanic yachts is about incense that gets burned down to perfume? Where the hell, on what wall did they get a translation stupid enough to support this idea, and then they are being paid to present it to the public?

How do you look at those pictures of animals, plants, and hear that list of other animals ivory, and not look at a genetic map of the continent and realize Poont/Punt is in and about the region of Kenya?

Mossad? 1967 Israel, Seriously? Blame the skilled and practiced Arabians for building someone elses dumb imitation of a wall design that has no ballast in it, how about the reality that some foreigner with no sailing experience created picture or blueprint/models/etc that is not even to scale for them to follow?

This project is on its way to failure and the English speaking public doesnt even notice because of the introduction placing errors in design on the shipwright family and not whoever directed them.

Pharironic times? ~ This film is making us moronic by a repeated number of times. (Yes, ferrous iron tools existed and the tools for boat making were not brass based. Cant believe secondary sources)

Who is the F***ing idiot who does not recognize that Khufus Cheops Giza boat is the Oceanic Yacht that was used before it was preserved next to the pyramids? The 146 foot length and rope with puzzled together pieces lets it flex over the sea, instead of getting bashed and slapped against the ocean on the other side of each wave. 146 feet and they thing it was a canoe? Not even going to admit it was a sea kayak and Atlantic yacht that reached south Brazil and returned from north of the Amazon River where two pyramids were built to tell them to double-time out into the Atlantic ocean so that the currents would carry them home to The Gambia or True Western Africa ?

Note: How do you visually calculate the latitude with the seasonal axial tilt from latitude less than 5, 10, to 22.5 degree? What does the night sky look like in these latitudes?

Its a Ceremonial Row Boat. -- Holy cow poop sex with mushrooms. You PROFESSIONALOS think a 146 Foot or 50 Meter Yachts is the same as a die-cast scaled down toy car people bury with themselves?

We want to build something much more substantial.
And there you have it folks, some idiots or devious Vatican loyalists pretending to not know better, said I don't care if you Arabian Mohammed people are experience shipwrights and skilled carpenters or that the 5 separate Khufu Cheops Yachts are proof of a working model of ocean going vessels. We Christians want to build the Titanic Walled Vatican Bathtub and sink the hopes and dreams and history of you Arabian people and these pharaoh we stole Genesis Chapter 2 from.

Ancient Boat Expert Tom Vosmer heads inland. away from the ocean. For clues on how to make ocean yachts. Most ocean vessels are made near ocean ports. The Expert wants to travel inland and examine how river and creek boats are made as a basis, because his expert opinion is that the ocean yachts were on the river delta, and the inland canoes were on the ocean??? This man has got to be of the Vatican Faith or under someone who is.

Really a very complex puzzle. -- the complex.. is a mental complex or block in your head that starts from slot car model experience and refuses to basis of your boat on the Pharaohs real world existing boat.

Since no one has built a ship like this in thousands of years. ~ No one ever built a ship anything like what you designed. It is not based on any historical evidence of comprehension. Not only did you not make a scale replica of one of the 5 ships that exit from Giza. This thing old people test in young people called reading comprehension. You two put zig/\zags in the wood like 2nd graders, with no notion that they are stop-points or notches to keep the planks from stretching apart the ropes holding them together. From the pictures of rope and notches in 5 seconds of film in this video I figured out the purpose of notches = stops at the working load limit of rope (Not the break limit, working load is ratios less, and it being a wet unsealed boarded the ropes will be multitudes stronger and swell tighter on the boards) mix in some ballast and stick to the flatter hull design of the real world existing examples.

About 35 minutes remaining.

They did not bend wood. They carved it, just like a statue. -- Where does this profane woman get the idea they do not bend wood? Did she not see with her own eyes that Khufu Cheops is clearly a bent plank boat made 2,000-3,000 BC? On what stupidity does she Titanic this boat as not being allowed to flex?

Theyve got to attach it together in a completely different way from, modern boats.  Theyve got to attach it together in a completely different way than, the ancient boats too!! Where is there a dead fish spine type keel in Giza? You are making a dead-turtle-shell as the spine of your boat. In no way is this like any Pharaohs boat. You are using the fresh water boat designs of Europe that sank and tipped over in rapids and oceans.

About 33 minutes remains. It looks exactly like modern rope. About 38,00 years ago.

Hopeless.. Why is the rope being shown, not the rope that was in the pits of Giza with the 5 boats they found buried next to the pyramids? From the looks of it, at least based on the anchors, then I would be guessing 800 AD to 1800AD from small net fishing dingy to large merchant ship, based on the difference in anchor sizes possibly European like the ones in Florida by the Spanish. -- Do you have carbon dating? With so many samples it would be forgivable for a single glass slide to be carbon dated. Why are you just smiling and saying it looks modern, but is

You do understand the caves are not of the same design and skill set as the hieroglyphs on a stone outside of them.  If the caves were not sealed, then it is impossible that the sea mist did not destroy them in 1,000 years.

A pile of Wooden Crates.  so you. Youve never heard of grave robbers. And seem to think wooden crates. Well have you ever seen a wooden crate in a pyramid that was not the property of a thief stealing and selling history, usually to people who were once Vatican Faith church goers?

Kathryn BardBoston Vatican Massachusetts An inscription on a box (not a Crate as mentioned before). The wonderful things of punt. You do understand.that looks like stone, not wood.and why would you think ONLY People from Britain, can read and write in English? There is not logic to a celebratory etching, except for someone who stole the pharaohs punt treasures to sell over seas. Find out where those ropes were grown. Get plant DNA and you MAY find your exporter/thief. The locations tells you some-one was robbing Luxor from this point so that they did not pass by the people in Cairo and the Government of Egypt. We just moved to a time after the French Napoleon chronicles of the wealth in Egypt, a time when European Grave Raiders must have used this coast for smuggling.
About 32 minutes remaining.
Hatshepsut successfully gathered them from Poont/Punt.
Successfully gathered. Yet, they are WHERE? Again is no one aware the Vatican faithful are thieves?

About 30 minutes remaining.
So you found the remains of an ocean going ship that stranded the smugglers. And for some reason assumes the smugglers ships were of Egypt Design or Construction? See many tree near that beach did you? -- Have you bothered to identify the species of wood or compared the growth rings to the rain patterns of Europe port cities and boats? So you drew a wedge on top of a picture that was not there?

.Khufu River Boat.??  Who the hell makes a 146 foot river boat? Have you tried sailing a 16-28 foot boat around the bends most rivers have? And yet, you seem to think a 146 foot Yacht is a river boat?

Intent on following the evidence. of a European boat hull crashed and stranded with its smugglers on the shore of Egypt?

Think about it.. I am seeing paired Mortise and Tenon joints.. do such words sound Arabian at all?
I have seen mortised boats. They were European and they sank off Florida.

About 28 Minutes remaing.

No tool marks? Easy. Was toilet gaskets. A lot of bees wax as mortor before European wood was driven together. -- The picture is of a lack of caulking in the smugglers wreck, is not a picture of what she is talking about. And I wrote it somewhere here. The water wet the ropes like oil wets the internals of an engine.

Poor Tom Vosmer. You designed the wood model these Arabian must painfully duplicate. Are you sure you are not faking your confusion? The Egyptians floated their decks above the wood hulls. This is the reason their boats a wider, is so that more wood is submerged for greater buoyancy of the floating suspended decks above the submerged planks of the hull, that doubled as weighted ballast.

Despite his fears the builders push on? I doubt very much successful experienced builders wanted to build it with sealing the joints. Dont you mean Tom ordered them to forge on with those fears in their minds?

So. Tom made one boat before and, it Sank! Has Tom the archeologist whom NOVA labeled an Expert on ancient boats ever made a boat that floats?  Try a cardboard refrigerator box and some saran wrap with duck tape, it might float better than the one that sank. Best Wishes.

About 26 minutes remaining.

Ship building skills are passed on
Mushrooms on cow crap are in the narrators cult like cool-aide. Someone is abusing the elbow joints and physical health of the entire family and this program is disguising it.

This project is a sabotage of their skills and physical health. They have never had to pound and cut away at such large timber in their life. So abused and in so much pain, from swinging hammers, that their children have had to show up and damage their own joints to complete a project the foreigners were probably complaining about. Why is it taking so long? Just make it, we paid for it. Yes but our ships are only 2 inches thick, not 16 inches planks. But you're the best in Egypt, so shut up and die with your whole family, make us our Smuggler Thiefs ship now!

Carrying on..tradition. Really? Where the hell is the tradition of this sort of IRON WALL WOODEN boat from? During the NAVAL war history of the United States they made hulls this thick to fend off Canon Fire. Never before Gun Powder Canons were boat hulls ever this thick!

If a ship held together with mortis and tenon joints Where in the Phorah pits of the 5 boats of Giza, is there a mortise and tenon boat hull?  This program is a God=Jihad attack on the reputation of Egypt, that loyal skilled boat builders are following because they trust your paper degrees, and were not allowed to study the evidence first hand themselves. Elah Elohim, may we restore their health and honor.

About 24 minutes remaining.

David Vann, please do not turn out to really be a Florida graduate. Our American Sailing Association have got to have more common sense and critical thinking skills than being the tools of Vatican Spanish Florida Conquest until 1835 AD and the end of the Inquisitions from 1184 AD toward the genocide of Arabians in the oceans, islands, and continent opposite side of the Atlantic.

David Vann, Hes got some sense. And a keen sense of humor. Epoxy. Good one.

Cheryl Ward. Such a skilled electrician..why without prior experience was she appointed to design the plumbing? What better to sink this ship than a metal conduit designer? Who was the mastermind of deception that placed her here or is it as it appears her own will? -- What an evil woman. She looked for Egyptian boats that sank. But could only find the wreck of European smugglers, then spitefully said, damn those Arabian ancestors and suffer for my pride under the evidence of us white people stealing your history as decorations. -- Those wood worms = Teredo Navalis = Vatican Latin for we must kill and sink the Arabian Atlantic sailors before we claim their continent. You do realize Teredo Navalis are a North Atlantic creature from the north coast of Spain, France, England, and Portugal and not from the Mediterranean or African waters? If the timbers have been eaten by wood worms as was shown, then the wood has been to the North Atlantic. Ancient Egypt preferred Brazil and China doing very little trade in the waters that had wood worms. Though African Impingo Wood used by the Quran people was hard enough to sail those waters and mix blood with the Scottish women on their short-cut to China from Moorish Spain.

About 20 minutes remaining.

Peace be with you. Such great skill as you and your shipwrights. This design and the method of assembly is entirely the work of Tom Vosmer and Cheryl Ward. No boat designed and built by Egypt would ever sink not be such a bloated waste of wood, in a country that values trees and uses papyrus to write on.

About 19 minutes remaining.

Where does she get this donkey stuff from? It was either Bovine Bos (Water Buffalo) or Camel. I have never seen a Donkey or pack mule pictured on a Pyramid.

About 18 minutes remaining.

The boat is too high out of the water and heavy. The Khufu Cheops Giza boats at the center of the deck are barely 4 feet about the waterline, with large flat bottoms for lots of contact and buoyancy. This steep keeled Hull is the European ocean vessel type for straight lines, yet every painting on the walls of Egypt shot Tack and Jibe sailing like a snake up and down the coast lines turning quickly to catch the wind, and using oars as keels and rudders, in addition to propulsion alternating people.

Before 17 minutes remaining.

Mahrous Lahma, must have gotten his family into this thinking of money and fame. His words are the words of a man who does not want to insult the custom for asking for a jogging suit made of wooden paper. Clearly it is the paper at fault. Then the customer says, yes exactly, If only we had the nylon wood the ancients must have been using to smuggle antiques to the northern coast of Europe with steeply beam hulled ships and Teredo Navalis.

Linen. It comes from. Flax comes from. not to be confused with Egyptian Cotton.

Flax AND Teredo Navalis,
Both come from Northern Atlantic Spain, France, Netherlands.
All found with stranded smuggled stuff from Luxor kept in honor of Poont(Punt spelling?).

At 14 minutes remaining.

Migraines look at how much of that top heavy ship has been designed above the waterline hanging beyond its base. One Titanic Top heavy turnover waiting to happen the moment a two person Jet Ski runs by creating a modest wake to rock it.

At 11 minutes remaining. Oi. Look at where the waterline is. The worst tea cup still balances better.

At 10 minutes remaining. TURTLE! I like the David Vann person. That was exactly the design. Nothing to do with Pharaohs, or a history relating to their own wisdom or designs. 1 Turtle Spine Saucer Cup.

Why for the love of Europes Vatican Satan, did you not follow the Khufu Cheops flat bottom design?

7 minutes remaining. Poont/Punt is by my guess Kenya Uganda.

About 1 minute remaining. All we learned is that a square sail has more surface area = more push and speed than a triangle Mast of Sloops and Jibs.

Way too much rocking especially with 9 tons of sand ballast.
Where in the design did the pharaohs poont/punt cargo get stored?
How far above waterline of their wrecked European boat hull and how much closer to tipping over?

Do you really believe this story of five oceanic yachts is about incense that gets burned down to perfume? I supposed believing the returns were all burned up, covers up the small bits of the smugglers stash stored in the sands of the red sea that sailed from the North East Atlantic of Continental Europe. Notice how the Nazi in Switzerland found an endless supply of mummified bodies they were told to burn as incense and snort like tobacco to create longevity for their health and the Vatican Church that told Hitler such things as they massacred the Aramaic (Aromatic?) in Poland = Holocausts.

Many other books and videos have a shadow extraterrestrial agenda on them that makes them a bit unpalatable. I thoroughly enjoyed this episode.",1365465600,,380,5.245901639344262
