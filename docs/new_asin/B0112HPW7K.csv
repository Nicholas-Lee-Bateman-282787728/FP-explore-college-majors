7319999,5,B0112HPW7K,"This is a great collection for any child to have. We often take out of town trips and the kids love watching DVD's in our portable player. I wanted to add a more educationally appropriate DVD to our collection. This has been a hit. The kids love the stories put into movie form. My 3 year old has a few favorites and I have since purchased these books for him. I love that we can select the ""book"" we want to watch, or watch them all. I would buy this again and recommend to other parents. grandparents, day-care centers etc.",1453507200,,525,4.26

7320001,5,B0112HPW7K,Such a sweet collection of holiday stories.  My 4 and 7 year olds like to take turns picking what to watch.,1452470400,2,107,4.095238095238095
7320002,5,B0112HPW7K,"My 4 year old is a book lover. She has been reading since 3, but still prefers to have books read to her most of the time. She had watched The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child on Netflix/Amazon Prime Instant, and fell in love with these short video adaptions of kids' picture books. If you have a child who loves books, he or she may enjoy this DVD. If you're not sure whether your child would sit through this type of DVD, try watching The Gruffalo on Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant, first. I could see how these shorts might not be super engaging for some children, especially ones that usually watch regular cartoons on cable tv, as the picture quality is a little ""old school."" Think like '90s quality animation. However, we have loved this DVD so far (we just got it in the mail today). It's totally worth the $3 we spent.",1450224000,2,829,4.3896103896103895
7320003,4,B0112HPW7K,You have to pick a few and watch because younger kids lose attention.,1449532800,,69,4.384615384615385
7320004,3,B0112HPW7K,"The Stories are great all Scholastic titles! problem?  There is no problem if you purchase this DVD for your home use. If you are a teacher or a school this DVD does not come with performance rights, meaning you cannot show this DVD in a classroom or any public place. It would have been nice to know that before I purchased this item. Thankfully I was able to return it easily to amazon.",1448841600,,388,4.315068493150685
7320005,1,B0112HPW7K,Not worth the price and I paid 3$ n change. My son is 4 and didn't like any of them but 1. He couldn't even sit still long enough to watch them. Didn't hold his attention. Why is Max and Ruby on the case if not in the movies. My child was sad on that. :(,1447718400,,254,3.5535714285714284

7320007,5,B0112HPW7K,The stories that they picked for the dvd are good. I can watch one at a time or chose more for my grandchild to watch. They love to see the ones that I have read to them. Great review.,1446940800,2,184,3.7435897435897436
7320008,3,B0112HPW7K,This is a cute DVD for the price i found it has some classic tales but also some i have never heard of so must be new for this generation. Nice to keep ages 3-8 entertained with over three hours of cartoon stories.,1444435200,,214,4.0

7320065,5,B0112HPW7K,"Scholastic / Weston Woods puts out DVD collections of short films made from children's picture books.  The text of these films is exactly the text of the books.  The visuals are based on the illustrations from the books.  In most cases they are animated, but sometimes the camera just pans the still illustrations from the books.  This collection of 20 stories is a great bargain.  Usually Scholastic sells collection of just  6 or 8 stories for $12.  We buy all the Scholastic/Weston Woods collections for the library where I am the children's librarian.  They are always high quality, and popular with kids, parents, and teachers.  The stories on this DVD are....
1.  Night Before Christmas - The classic story is read well, but unfortunately the pictures don't move, except when Santa's sleigh moves across the screen.  The illustrations have an Americana theme with lots of patchwork quilts and primitive style artwork.
2.  Max's Christmas - Bossy big sister tells Max about Santa, and then Max waits up.
3.  Merry Christmas, Splat - Splat, the funky-looking cat, tries to be good so Santa will bring a big present.
4.  Morris's Disappearing Bag - Morris, the youngest in a bunny family, gets a bag that makes things disappear.
5.  Merry Christmas Space Case - A space alien visits Earth for Christmas.
6.  Bear Snores On - While a bear hibernates, other animals visit his cave.  Only partially animated.
7.  Noah""s Ark - The Bible story. No animation.
8.  Too Many Tamales - Maria helps her mother make tamales for Christmas.  Not animated, static pictures.
9.  Lemonade in Winter - There are no customers for a lemonade stand in winter.  Teaches a bit about counting money.
10.  The Snowy Day -Classic story about Peter playing in the snow.
11.  Fletcher and the Snowflake Christmas - Fletcher the fox worries that Santa won't know where to find his rabbit friends who have recently moved.
12.  In the Month of Mislev - A Hanukkah tale.  Still pictures, and too long.
13.  The .Little Drummer Boy - Static illustrations by Ezra Jack Keats are shown while a simple version of the song is sung.
14.  Seven Candles for Kwanzaa - Explanation of what Kwanzaa is.  No animation, just static pictures.
15.  Great Joy - A little girl invites a homeless organ grinder and his monkey to the church Christmas play.  Static pictures.
16.  Antarctic Antics - Songs sung by penguins. Really lively.
17.  Giving Thanks- A Native American chief talks about being thankful.
18.  Bear Has a Story to Tell - The other animals are too busy getting ready for winter to listen to bear's story.
19.  Clown of God -  A peasant boy finds a career as a juggler.
20.  Brave Irene -  Melodramatic tale of a little girl fighting a snowstorm.

7320071,4,B0112HPW7K,"Around the Holiday's I am always looking for movies to put on for the kids to help us get in the Christmas spirit. I have the other Scholastic Storybook DVD collection and love it so when I saw a holiday collection I snatched it up.  This is exactly what it says, 20 Holiday Adventures of animated Scholastic storybooks.  It's a good collection, a bit dry or boring in a couple areas but those moments are short and you quickly move on to the next story.  Or if you don't want to watch the entire collection you can pick and choose one story at a time.  They did a great job of choosing which stories were included. Our entire family enjoyed this DVD and we are glad we have added it to our Christmas movie collection.",1454112000,5,718,4.296296296296297
