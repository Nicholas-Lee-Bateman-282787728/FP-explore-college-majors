8643151,5,B00IKU4GSO,excellent.  a lot of great information to absorb.  purchased it for the sake of learning how to do canopy work but the rest of the material is fantastic as well.  For what you are getting it is worth the price for sure.  His teaching style is straight to the point.  Real life working techniques.  and deeper explanation when he deems it to be essential.  would buy it if you have any interest in doing tree work safely.
