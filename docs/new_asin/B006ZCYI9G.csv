8506879,3,B006ZCYI9G,"Typical soft core, exploitation film. Pretty actress, nudity, bondage, an actual story line, but all kind of meh. Might be the language difference, or the cultural differences, but I really couldn't get into it. Not like Wife To Be Sacrificed, or the Lonely Cow. Those were compelling. This just kind of drifts along.",1455840000,,317,5.0
8506880,4,B006ZCYI9G,"I've seen this type of flick before, the difference this time out is the way the bondage scenes are showcased. The use of color, scene composition, peripheral images and set pieces elevate these scenes to an almost photographic beauty, without forgetting the erotic element for a moment. The director's eye for these details makes this artful and engaging. The story is a good one, the two female leads are excellent, the scorpion metaphor another touch of aesthetic underpinning, and the ending brought closure after the surreal, dream-like snow scene and we found out the final fate of our heroine. A first-rate example of near-brilliance on a budget, this flick is erotic without falling into the low-brow exploitation abyss most do. If you enjoy a bit of class with your erotica, this one's 'bound' to please.",1279238400,2,813,5.029629629629629
8506881,3,B006ZCYI9G,"There were two movies (The Passions of a Private Secretary & Secrets Of A Desperate Housewife) that were released on the same day by the production company (Epoch Cinema), of the two movies, The Passions Of A Private Secretary is a much better movie.  You've probably already read the description so here's my review.

What I really liked about this film (other than the beautiful female lead), is that it has a semi-believable store line.  A young woman, who is scheduled to be married to a welltodo man (who happens to be the son of the president of the company she works for), is invited out for a drink with he now ex-boyfriend (who works for the same company).  While she is in the nearly empty bar, she passes out (presumbly from her drink being drugged).  While she is unconscious, her ex and a crazy prostitute that her ex has been seeing, bind her in tradiional S&M bondage with ropes and suspend her from the ceiling.  You can probably guess what happens for the rest of the night.

The next morning, the secretary is distracted from her work because she is thinking about what happened to her the previous night, she is even more distrcated when her ex emails her pics of what her in bondage.  That night, she meets her ex at the bar to get the pics back, and once again winds of bound and hanging fro the ceiling.  The cycle continues to happen over the next several days.  I'd tell you how the movie ends, but there really isn't an ending.

Ok, now that I've given you a synopsis of the film, I'll tell you what I did and didn't like about this film.  First off, I really like the two females in the film.  The secretary is an absolutely beautiful young woman whose beauty is only amplified by her naive appearance and her professional wardrobe.  This actress would turn heads in any part of the world.  The second female actress, who plays a crazy prostitute, isn't as beautiful as the secretary, but makes up for it with her demeaner, it seems like she's drunk for the entire movie and it makes her seem adoreable.

Now, on to the what I didn't like about this movie.  There is never a ""money shot"" durring this film.  I would have really liked to have seen a shot of the females nude from the front.  As it is, when the females leads are having sex they never remove their panties, so it is fairly obvious that the sex is simulated.  Also, how the film ends is completely undefinded, meaning it doesn't fit with the storyline, it's one of those endings that you have to make up what it means because whoever wrote the movie didn't know how to write and ending.",1248652800,18,2576,4.428874734607219
