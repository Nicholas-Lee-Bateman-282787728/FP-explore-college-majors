2543486,5,B000EXDS7K,"Some say that Season 3 wasn't as good as the first two.  I say even on their least funny episodes, Arrested Development is light years above any other comedy out there.  There is not a moment of AD that I didn't love, and if Tobias as the mole doesn't make you laugh so hard it hurts...

Watch all episodes, all seasons in order to FULLY appreciate the genius that is Arrested Development.",1141948800,19,389,4.375
2543487,1,B000EXDS7K,"Don't you hate it when you brag to all your friends about how something is so cool and when you finally show it to them it falls flat and you look like a fool.  That's how I feel about season 3 of Arrested Development.  I cringe at how bad it is.  I hope it gets canceled if it's going to be this bad from now on.  I don't know what happened.  It could be that there were different writers, the lack of Henry Winkler, the under use of Jeffery Tambor, the hieghtened absurdity of the David Cross gay jokes, the horrible retard plot or maybe it was never good to begin with and we all just built it up so much we let ourselves down.  It's not the latter.  I recently saw season 1 again and it's amazing.  Season 3 is just bad, bad, bad.  Matrix sequels bad.",1141948800,16,755,4.047297297297297
2543488,4,B000EXDS7K,"I'm an avid fan of this show but Season 3 took a hit when more than one of their key writers left while the show's fate was in limbo after the end of Season 2.  Fox wanted to cancel it but a grassroots campaign convinced them otherwise.  Still, Fox treated the show poorly by immediately cutting the order from 22 to 13 episodes, then moving it to Monday at 8pm into the lion's den of comedy TV night, then took it off for weeks for baseball, then off again for November sweeps, then gave it the bum's rush by playing all 4 final episodes on yet another night (Friday) against the opening ceremonies of the Olympics!

No respect, I tell yah!

The season starts right where the masterful 2nd season left off with ""The Cabin"", but part way into the second episode, the writing became noticeably suspect and uncharacteristic-- not novel, but a bit on the lame side.  Adding to the problem, they cast Charlize Theron to play the role of Bateman's love interest, and the character and surrounding Wee Britain is virtually laugh free and cartoonish.  And that took up a fair share of 5 episodes.

Don't get me wrong however, there are still many classic laughs, just no where near the consistent quality, density and flow of the first two seasons.  Here's to hoping Showtime really does pick up the show, and that all the strong writers come back!

As a devout fan, I'm buying this as soon as it hits the streets, but for those new to the show, start with Season 1, Disc 1 and taste the happy.",1141948800,13,1487,4.4375
2543489,5,B000EXDS7K,"Great review Radaar but there is one slight mistake Maeby and George Michael actually share their first kiss in the pilot episode of Arrested Development. In the season 2 finale ""Righteous Brothers"" that is the second time they kiss. This show is a must have for any DVD collection, and one of the greatest benefits of the show on DVD is that it leads itself so greatly to subsequient viewings so many jokes will be missed the first, second, and even third time around. This show is an instant classic, and rather then having to play hide and go seek on the FOX network you can finally watch the show critcs and fans are always raving about. I've never met a person who after two or three episodes of the show hadn't become hooked, its impossible to dislike this show. There are tons of hiliarious guest in season 3 from Henry Winkler's final appearance, before he left to do his own show, to Charlize Theron, Scott Biao, Judge Reinhold, Ben Stiller returns, Andy Ritcher's back, and a special appearance by Jason Bateman's sister Justine. The last four episodes are absolutely incredible, and then finale just feels so right, everything is tied up and it makes you proud to be a fan of this show. Whether it goes to Showtime or does not the way the show ended was on the highest of notes producing one of the greatest (possible) series finales ever.",1141948800,15,1350,4.582644628099174
2543490,5,B000EXDS7K,"If you have never seen Arrested Development you are in for a big surprise.  It will surprise you how a show this great,(and I think it's the BEST comedy ever made) has somehow missed your radar and then it will shock you to find out that FOX has taken the show off the air.(Don't worry a Showtime deal is in the works) As a loyal fan I do suggest you start with Season 1 because although the episodes do stand alone well, they are part of a larger story.  Hopefully this is not the end for us loyal followers, for the new watchers it's just the beginning.",1141948800,14,555,4.177570093457944
2543491,5,B000EXDS7K,"FOX dropped the ball. Showtime will probably pick it up and run with it. If you're interested in comic genious, buy this season and watch it. Marvel at how the final episode book-ends the 3 seasons of AD, essentially mirroring the pilot. Genius!",1141948800,12,245,4.72093023255814
2543492,5,B000EXDS7K,"This show is hands down the funniest and best-written comedy ever. It's as good as Seinfeld, but totally different from it. It's packed with so many jokes, I still pick up on new things after several viewings. Once you finish watching the season, you'll want to watch it again, and buy the first two seasons if you don't own them already.",1141948800,9,338,4.557377049180328
2543493,5,B000EXDS7K,"Unfortunately, I didn't get into Arrested Development until late in its second season.  However, I was immediately hooked.  I could see that it was a completely new kind of show, and far from your average sitcom.  It's one of the few comedy series I've seen that is serialized, meaning that events of one episode carry over into the next episode.  Also, it is probably the only comedy I know that, in addition to constantly referencing past jokes, it actually references FUTURE jokes!  The show is done without a laugh track and is shot as a documentary, so the characters in the show sometimes react to the camera, and the camera sometimes reactions to situations in the show.
The second season ended brilliantly with George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffry Tambor) fooling authorities into arresting and incarcerating his twin brother Oscar (also Tambor).  George's children Michael (Jason Bateman), GOB (Will Arnet), Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), and Buster (Tony Hale) vowed not to visit their ""father"" in prison for a few months so that he couldn't manipulate him.  Meanwhile, Lindsay's husband Tobias (David Cross) left for Vegas with George Sr's secretary Kitty (Judy Greer) to join the Blue Man Group.  Also, cousins George Michael (Michael Cera) and Maeby (Alia Shawkat) shared their first passionate kiss.  Season three starts off Michael going to prison to visit his ""father"" for the first time in 3 months to tell him that the Bluth Developing Company is bouncing back.  While there, he realizes that it is really Oscar behind bars, so he takes his son George Michael on a hunt for the real George Sr.  Upon finding him, the government allows George Sr. to remain under house arrest so that he can reconnect with his wife Lucille (Jessica Walter).  George immediately regrets the decision.  Meanwhile, GOB is unknowingly reunited with his illegitimate son Steve Holt (Justin Grant Wade), a classmate of George Michael and Maeby who began searching for his father in the previous year after GOB made fun of him for not having a father (IRONY!).  This starts a great arc involving GOB and Steve who are the perfect duo until GOB realizes who Steve really is.
Soon, Michael starts dating a British woman named Rita (Charlize Theron) whom he meets while investigating his father's claim that a British building company set him up to take the fall for building some houses in Iraq.  As Michael's relationship with Rita develops, we learn that there may be more to her than she is saying, especially since her creepy ""uncle"" Trevor (Dave Thomas) follows the couple around everywhere.
As the season develops, viewers finally find out the (most probable) cause of death for Michael's late wife Tracy, Tobias gets hair plugs, which nearly kill him, J. Walter Weatherman (Steve Ryan) makes his triumphant return, and one of the greatest ""gimmick"" episodes of televions ever is created.  The episode S.O.B.s, which stands for Save Our Bluths, is a parody of the various gimmicks that television shows use to get more ratings.  There are numerous guest stars, most of whom are only on-screen for about a second, numerous references to the much-more-popular Desperate Housewives, a live segment, some 3D segments, and even a death!  In the commercial for the episode right before it aired (which is fortunately included in the set, because it adds humor to the episode and not seeing it would make one of the Narrator's lines a little confusing), announcers said that ""one of these characters would die"", and there was a quick montage of most of the main characters and a few side characters.  Turns out that the person who died was introduced in that episode and may not have even had a line of dialogue.  Also, a lot of fans were hoping that HBO or Showtime would pick the show up, and there were allusions to that speculation in the episode.
The last four episodes of the season may be some of the best in the show's history.  Featuring guest stars such as Judge Reinhold, William Hung (in probably his greatest use ever), Justine Bateman (Jason's sister), Richard Belzer (playing his Detective John Munch character), and Ron Howard, making his first on-screen appearance on the show, we finally find out the truth about George Sr's crimes, and Annyong Bluth (Justin Lee) delivers one of the finest twists imaginable.
While the season started off a little slow, it became amazing, and, despite it's brevity, may be the best season of the show.  Every episode from ""The Ocean Walker"" to ""Harboring Resentment"" (also known as ""Development Arrested"") were pure gold.  The show's writers are all geniuses.  I don't know where some of the jokes were coming from, but they sure know how to come up with some hilariously bizarre situations.  The year, in addition to coming up with great new jokes, expanded a lot on past jokes.  One of my favorites was that GOB's puppet Franklin became an actual character in a sense, as opposed to a gag.  Franklin even has his own fanbase now (I'm one of them).  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the season was cut down to 13 episodes, there were plenty of things that the writers weren't able to do.  In the season premiere, there allusions to Buster getting a new hand, after losing it to a seal last year (pay attention to the scene when GOB and Steve Holt meet up for the first time).
After all three seasons of unsuccessful ratings, FOX finally killed the show.  While I am very upset, I guess I have to hand it to FOX for sticking with the show for so long (from a ratings stand-point, it should have been killed after season 1).  They believed in its greatness enough to give it so many chances (oddly, they didn't really advertise for it, which probably hurt the ratings), and at least it went out still at the top of its game.  There are still rumors going around that Showtime is planning on picking it up, so we may yet see some more of this great show.  If not though, at least the writers tied up all the loose ends and even hinted at a possible movie.  If you've never seen Arrested Development, it is beyond worth checking out.  It is my favorite comedy show of all time, surpassing even mainstream hits like The Simpsons and Seinfeld as well as the quirky and underrated Scrubs.  You will not regret buying this set.",1141948800,276,6250,4.776022304832714

2543745,4,B000EXDS7K,"If you like innuendos, sarcasm, satire, and hidden double meanings then you should enjoy this series.

It makes little to no sense at all, yet it grabs your attention as if someway it does.

It is only about 20-25 minutes for each episode, long enough to make it totally time wasting justifiable.

CAUTION, it is not for kids. Although it sounds innocent enough, there a some pretty explicit verbiage and discussions that may paint to explicit a mental picture for some kids, and then you will have to explain 'what do they mean, Mommy? or Daddy?",1439424000,,546,4.666666666666667

The new series on Netflix is good, but I think the original Fox series was great.  In in sense it reminded me of ""Soap"" a show my parents watched in the 70's or 80's.  It pushed the envelope and like Arrested Development it made changes in the programming we see today.  It's fun, quirky, greatly acted and you really like these characters even though you probably shouldn't.",1432944000,,490,4.5227272727272725

I saw it pop up on Amazon Prime, however, and decided to see what the cult following was all about. I get it now. The writing is sophisticated yet the story threads are completely outlandish. In a sense it reminds me of the Simpsons with that sometime-blend of sly, cutting humor running through it. Season 3 in particular was excellent. It's too bad there are only four seasons but I'll be moving on to the fourth season now (though I wish it was free as were seasons 1-3.)",1413072000,,586,4.485981308411215

The cast is first rate, and the writing is sharp, with wry humor, and enough self-deprecation to endear this work to anyone with a sense of humor beyond fart jokes...",1382918400,,411,4.407894736842105

2543974,5,B000EXDS7K,Season 1 was the best but season 3 is still highly entertaining.  I don't normally watch sitcoms but this one really hooked me with its quick wit which requires close attention to the dialog.  The laughs are not cheap laughs.  Sad that there aren't more episodes.,1379462400,,263,4.673913043478261

2543980,5,B000EXDS7K,I have no idea why it was canceled after this season. It was the best season out of all three. Much more witty and dry than the first two seasons.,1378252800,,146,3.9
2543981,5,B000EXDS7K,"I've loved this TV show since the start, but it just keeps getting better. Michael, the middle brother and head of the company, seems like such a voice of reason in a totally ridiculous, dysfunctional family, but when he tries to bond with his son, his words are just as ludicrous as the rest of the family. I'm glad to hear a 4th Season will be forthcoming.",1377993600,,358,4.358208955223881
2543982,4,B000EXDS7K,"The show had it's moments and was entertaining.  Unfortunately, I think any viewer would find the show a bit redundant.  Bateman was probably my favorite of the actors. Jessica Walter was my favorite in the season.",1377993600,,214,4.916666666666667

2543991,5,B000EXDS7K,"I'm a big fan of Arrested Development. I've seen all 4 seasons multiple times, know the running jokes by heart, and can talk extensively about the humor and foreshadowing in the show.

Season 3, in my opinion, is probably the weakest of the 4 seasons. Subplots drag on longer than they should, some main plot elements are breezed through quickly, and at times it feels like the writing is based around the concept of it being cancelled rather than presenting a good story. That being said, however, the show is still great. The humor is still there. Some great lines and running gags are developed. Plus the last four episodes really do give the show a proper (at the time) ending that feels right for the show. Furthermore, a lot of the weaker subplots do get better upon a second viewing, once all the jokes are explained.

Overall, season 3 might not satisfy you as much as the phenomenal season 2, but it's still Arrested Development, and it's still fantastic.",1377302400,,964,4.6647058823529415
2544008,5,B000EXDS7K,There are too many great jokes in this season.  You HAVE to watch this! buy it. you won't be disappointed.,1377302400,,106,4.3
2544009,5,B000EXDS7K,One of the funniest series I've ever seen. I can't believe it was cancelled.  Laugh out loud funny during each and every episode.,1377129600,,129,4.608695652173913
2544010,5,B000EXDS7K,I wish I would have seen it when it was on tv. If you're looking for something to watch this will definitely entertain you. It's funnier than 2 and half men because their are more characters and most of them are a little nutty. I'll watch all the seasons again soon I'm sure.,1376956800,,275,4.2075471698113205

I don't understand why FOX does stupid things like cancel shows with such a following (see family guy).  Amazing how disconnected they are from their audience base.  Must watch",1376784000,,250,4.904761904761905
2544015,5,B000EXDS7K,"Season 3 is every bit as great as the first 2. The jokes are more layered. The end of the season is bittersweet, as the show breaks the 4th wall, asking for support and railing against its own impending cancellation.",1376611200,,216,4.425
2544016,4,B000EXDS7K,"Arrested Development's 3rd and final season still has many of the same running gags and punchy humor as the first 2 seasons, but there is something missing. Don't get me wrong, it is still very good. The fact is, the show was in the death throes and it comes through.

I still highly recommend this season, and the series. In retrospect, Arrested Development seems to be meant for DVD/streaming (hence the renewed season in NetFlix). The payoffs for some jokes span several episodes, so marathon watchers get rewarded.",1376524800,,518,4.886363636363637

2544026,5,B000EXDS7K,Don't watch until you have seen the first two seasons!  This is the best comedy series ever.  I wish it were still on the air.  Each actor is unbelievable in their role - I love them all!  This is a must watch series.,1375574400,,217,3.9767441860465116
2544027,5,B000EXDS7K,Hilarious and weird. I hope the characters catch a happy break soon though because it's leaning a little too much into 'black comedy' for my tastes.,1375574400,,148,4.730769230769231
2544028,5,B000EXDS7K,That this show is coming back.  Too bad Amazon didn't pick it up instead of NetFlix.  Love all the charaters.,1375315200,,109,4.4

2544048,4,B000EXDS7K,This show may not be for everyone. It isn't your typical comedy tv series. The characters are very entertaining; mostly because of how dysfunctional they are. The best part about this show is getting to watch the characters interact.,1373846400,,233,5.0

It follows a darkly hilarious premise with a plethora of characters you love to hate. There's Lindsay and Tobias, an odd mismatch of a couple with nothing in common who are too self absorbed to effectively raise their rebellious daughter, Mae. Lindsay is a self proclaimed liberal who is always joining protests and causes, claiming to have cared about them her entire life. Tobias is a doctor turned ""actor"", who is always struggling with his ""career."" Then there's Gob, a hopeless magician who will do anything to sleep with a woman. Buster, the ""baby"" of the family, is a grown man-boy with mommy issues. Then Jessica Walters plays the manipulating and scheming mother always looking to knock down anything threatening her way of life. Then Micheal Cera, who plays George Michael, the pervy son of Michael Bluth, who is in love with his own cousin, Mae. And, at the center of it all is Michael himself, played by none other than Jason Bateman, the respectable and responsible father, and new owner of the Bluth's family business, after their father is imprisoned for a great number of things which unravel gradually and hilariously as the show progresses. Every single character is as selfish, and self absorbed as the next (with the exception of Michael, holding them all together), but who knew that a show with so many unlikable, egocentric, and spoiled characters could be so downright hilarious?

Everyone knows, of course, that the essential ingredients for successful TV sitcoms are in the writing, the cast, and the timing of the show's release.  Arrested Development no doubt met both the former criteria; the writing is so clever, so offbeat, and so layered with wonderfully bizarre motifs (chicken dance, Tobias' ambiguous sexuality, George Michael and Maeby's on-again-off-again flirtation) that it begs repeated viewings.  And the cast is absolutely stellar.  Each individual performer is spectacular, but it's the way they riff off of one another that truly creates the show's magic.  The only problem with the show, I suppose, was in its timing.  It was cancelled after only three seasons, which signifies that its handlers didn't know how to market it, or perhaps that most viewers are not interested in TV that requires steadfast attention.

So we are left with 50 or so episodes that are, more or less, representing some of the funniest and best TV moments in the last twenty or thirty years.

This is by far one of the best tv series ever produced. If you don't feel ""normal"" after watching this series then you weren't watching. The story of Arrested Development follows a wealthy family whose lives are instantly turned upside down when George Bluth, head of the Bluth company in charge of a model home development in California, is arrested. The family begins to fall apart, if you wouldn't consider them already in ruins, and taking leadership the middle son, Michael Bluth, does his best to keep the family together. As the story progresses we discover just how messed up the whole family is, and through wildly improbable fiascos and drama we find the joy and hilarity in their complete oblivious nature to the shambles they find themselves in.

2544209,5,B000EXDS7K,"I love ""Arrested Development"" and consider it to be one of the most original, funny, offbeat, and intelligent television shows of all time. Having said that, I waffled between a four and five star rating for season three solely because while great, it still wasn't quite up to the amazingly high standards of the first two seasons. In the end, though, I couldn't bring myself to give it anything less than five stars, because it just isn't fair to punish the third season simply because the first two seasons were so far off the charts and warranted a rating greater than five stars.

Season three is shorter than the first two seasons, and the jokes are both a bit more biting, and a bit more off-color compared to the earlier shows. As always, Ron Howard's narration is a clear winner, and helps viewers new to the show to get their bearings on what's going on. One of the chief delights of the show for me is the long-running plotlines that span seasons: this season they become even more otherworldly and convoluted. Jason Bateman is a great actor and centers the off-kilter ensemble cast. This season he dates a British woman (Charlize Theron) and explores the British section of Orange County, in a lengthy subplot that was my least favorite of the entire series. I never thought this story helped flesh out Michael's character, nor did it further the flow of the show in what was an already truncated and busy season.

As always I loved Jeffrey Tambor as the lunatic patriarch of the Bluth family, and especially enjoyed the subplot about his trial for treason and the bizarre aftereffects of his dealings in Iraq. The guest stars this season were also great and included luminaries like James Lipton and Andy Richter. My favorite piece of casting was Scott Baio as attorney Bob Loblaw (who even has his own Internet site, the ""Bob Loblaw Law Blog""). Baio is brilliant here, as is Justine Bateman who makes a sultry appearance in an amazing turn of events. The entire cast is strong, the vast majority of the material is great (the rest is very good), and the finale is totally unexpected, which is exactly what you would expect from ""Arrested Development.""

I know I tend to abuse the word hilarious when I describe Arrested Development; but it truly is that funny!  No other show can/has maintain the high level of comedy as Arrested Development did (and still does on dvd).

Michael continues to hold together the Bluth family, even as things get even more out of hand.  George Michael and Maeby delve deeper into their feelings for each other, GOB is even more of a degenerate, George Sr. is still incorrigible, Lucille still the classic drunk, Lindsey still trying to avoid the ever more flamboyant Tobias, while Buster continues to wallow in a hell of his mother's making.

A rather short season--only 13 episodes--it still packs in the laughs.  The high quality of the humor is extended to the deleted/extended scenes (which is also shorter than the special features of the other 2 seasons for the obvious reason of fewer episodes).

Guest stars include: Judge Reinhold, Charlize Theron, Justine Bateman, Ed Begley Jr., William Hung, Andy Richter, Gary Cole, Scott Baio, and Richard Belzer, plus many others in varying cameo spots.

It was later revealed that the producers had no choice but to ""dumb down"" the show to try to increase viewership after FOX threatened cancellation. The episode order was already cut down to 13, and the network had bumped the show around various time slots and days. Halfway through the third and final year, it was revealed that the show was done for good. FOX wanted to find more suitable programming. Something along the lines of ""Skating with Celebrities"" and we all know what a huge success that turned out to be. And although the first few of the season weren't spectacular, they were still very entertaining, despite the network's interjection. They were still better than almost anything else on TV at the time.

It was the last 5 episodes (SOB's, Fakin it, Family Ties, Exit Strategy, and Development Arrested) were truly great ones. Instant classics. SOB's was basically a parody episode, filled with blows at the FOX network and clever double entendres addressing the show's current situation. The finale was arguably one of the best episodes of the entire series. It wraps up most of the storylines while leaving it open ended in case the show were to be resurrected (Which now seems like a pipe dream).

It probably didn't help that such an energetic show (with episodes under 22 minutes) was constantly interrupted with commercial breaks.

The first two seasons of Arrested Development was the funniest stuff I ever saw on American television. But this third season was simply not the same program. Never has the change of a show's writers been more abjectly evident in the quality of humor.

Some of the previous reviewers have pointed this out, but the over-whelming majority of those who have been writing here have used this as a soapbox to castigate Fox for cancelling the show. On one level, that's understandable, but I've found very few reviewers willing to admit that Season 3 just isn't that funny.

There seemed to be an emphasis on being ""clever"" rather than laugh-out-loud funny. I found the incessant, non-stop sexual innuendo/double entendre -- usually of the homoerotic variety -- to be a lame subsitute for actual humor. Were we really expected to burst into laughter at that stuff? It was like watching a ""Worst Of"" SNL special.

The ""Call back"" technique -- where actions, dialogue, etc, of previous episodes is referenced again -- was way overdone. Again, if it had been written in such a way that it was funny, it would have been different. But using call-back just for the sake of doing it is pointless.

There were some laughs -- the Tiny Town episode was probably the best. But by the second disc of this two-disc set, I knew I was watching just to complete the series. It wasn't funny any more and I could watch an entire episode with a straight face; impossible in the first two seasons.

The writers and producers of this show would have better served us by keeping the quality at the same earlier level rather than doing whatever they did that produced this embarrassing third season. What a let-down!",1171324800,20,1828,4.717868338557993

2544293,5,B000EXDS7K,"By the time the third season of Arrested Development began, it was clear that it would most likely be the final season, and the facts that FOX only ordered 13 episodes and then later dumped the final four episodes on the Friday night when the Olympic opening ceremonies were airing on NBC didn't bode well either.  Still, these did nothing to diminish the quality of one of the best comedies to air on American TV; in fact, likely cancellation probably gave Mitchell Hurwitz et al the balls to write one of the funniest episodes of the series: S.O.B.s, which took the show's already already highly self-referential style to new heights of meta-commentary humor (lame 3-D visual gags, overhyped promises to kill someone by the end of the episode, mentioning HBO and Showtime without actually mentioning them), the likes of which you'd be hard pressed to find in any other TV series.

I loved this series from the very first episode; it was one of those rare shows that hooks you in the pilot and never lets go.  Crisp, layered writing and directing rewarded me upon repeat viewings when, instead of paying attention to the main action or obvious jokes, I was able to pick out subtle visual gags, humorous throw-away lines to jokes first set up many episodes prior, and recurring gags that reward the devoted (some might say obsessive) viewer.

Perhaps the ballsiest plot ever on the series was the arc involving Michael falling in love with Rita, whom he comes to believe is a British spy out to get his family but in reality turns out to be a mentally challenged woman.  This kind of layered story-telling wasn't new to the series, but the fact that the writers wrote in such a way that the viewer wasn't sure who Rita was--whether she was the elusive ""Mr. F"", a British spy sent to wreak havoc upon George Bluth, or simply just a kinda strange woman who liked Michael.  As it turns out, there was no Mr. F, but really a MRF, and Michael ends up alone again and the government ends up with egg on its face.

I recommend this series to everyone I know.  It's one of the few that stands up to repeated viewings, and in fact, gets better with time.",1167782400,,2145,4.567708333333333

Anyway, on to the review.

I -adore- this program.  The narrative humor, and zany family never ceases to produce a laugh in this not so sit-com television show.  Season three makes no exception, and goes to great lengths toward the inevitable finale to make it clear that they weren't ready to be rubbed out.  If that doesn't bug you, (and why should it; if you enjoy the show you'll sympathize) you'll enjoy more of the bizarre and silly episodes that make this show so endearing.

There's not much to say that's not already been said.  The special features are so-so, but that's not the only reason to buy a DVD series these days, and honestly, the quality of the episodes more than makes up for it.

The bottom line:

Buy this if you enjoyed the other seasons, or if you're a fan of twisted and dysfunctional family comedies, ala Married With Children, the Family Guy, etc.",1165622400,2,1023,4.633333333333334

2544299,5,B000EXDS7K,"The third, and sadly final, season of Arrested Development, ended with a hilarious bang as opposed to a whimper; which fans of the show had come to expect.  Thanks to sinking ratings, the critically acclaimed, Emmy winning show was finally axed by Fox after struggling for three seasons.  However, creator Mitchell Hurwitz and co. poked fun at their own demise with runaway glee.  The season picks up where the second season left off: George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is on the run while his twin brother Oscar (also Tambor) sits in prison, and Michael (Jason Bateman) tries to sort everything out.  Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is off after her runaway husband (David Cross), and George Michael (Michael Cera) and Maeby (Alia Shawkat) experience a new kind of awkwardness after their first kiss.  Oh yeah, in case you don't know by now, they're cousins.  Yeah, it's business as usual for the much maligned Bluth family.  In the meantime, G.O.B. (Will Arnett) judges over an Inner-Beauty Pagent, Buster (Tony Hale) goes into a fake coma, Michael meets a woman who may be his long lost older sister (real life sister Justine Bateman), Lucille (Jessica Walter) has plans to show the family in a newer, better light (which doesn't go very well), and Michael and Buster venture to Iraq to save G.O.B. and learn just what George Sr. has been behind over the years, as well as who is the real brains of the family.  The series comes to an end the way many would expect, with most of the loose ends tied up, but with an open window as well for the series to return in a different medium, hopefully (please, please).  There's plenty of guest stars throughout this season, most notably the beautiful Charlize Theron as a love interest for Michael who may be more (or less) than she seems, and Scott Baio as a divorce lawyer for Tobias and Lindsay.  All in all, the third season of Arrested Development is pure hilarity all the way through these 13 episodes, and a fitting, bittersweet end to a series that redefined the sitcom as being more than a predictable, boring comedy, and just what it could be capable of doing.",1165104000,,2102,4.70299727520436

The acting couldn't be beat, nor could the storyline be improved upon. The ONLY beef I have with this otherwise-flawless show is the simple fact that NEVER ONCE DID WE SEE BUSTER'S CHICKEN DANCE!

In general, the style of an intricate story line and callbacks that were established the first two seasons are continued, and perhaps taken to the next level. An example would be the episode titled ""Family Ties."" To fully understand the little jokes, it helps to know who is in the cast for that episode.

For casual fans, the over-the-top antics of the Bluth family (which become ever-more ridiculous as the show wraps up in this collection) will probably annoy some, while others might just chuckle at the silly humor.

Yet for all types of fans, this collection will be sure to evoke some sort of emotional reaction, seeing as though these episodes are the final chapter of a great, original story.

In the end, the legacy of the show shines through during these final episodes, as the producers, actors and writers refused to take themselves nor the show's content and ultimate demise seriously, poking fun of ""rival"" Fox programs, low ratings and even themselves in not-so-thinly-veiled themes and wise-cracks.

I won't comment on the DVD ""Extras"" presented with the collection, because if you aren't entertained enough with the episodes themselves, you probably shouldn't be purchasing this collection in the first place.

In summary, for those who can't get enough Bluth, this is a must-buy; for casual fans just looking for something silly to watch when bored, it also a must buy; but for those just looking to jump on the bandwagon now, don't bother. Rent seasons 1 and 2 first.",1163030400,,1318,4.950226244343892

Fortunately, the writers did not abandon this fan base and kept the running jokes through the end.  It still keeps its originial witty charm and fantastic acting.

2544335,4,B000EXDS7K,"I am a big fan and love seasons 1 and 2.  I feel that season 3 is somewhat disappointing.  I assume that part of the difference between season 3 and the other seasons is that there was pressure to cram a lot of story into only 13 episodes, plus there were some new writers and pressure to make the jokes more accessible to newer viewers.

The actors are all wonderful, but I felt that the jokes were starting to become more crude and vulgar.  Where the previous seasons' jokes were funny because of its inappropriateness, season 3 relied on more jokes that were funny because they were supposed to repulse.  I loved watching the reactions of the rest of the characters who were uncomfortable and dumbfounded, so I wasn't as pleased with this change.  I also wasn't crazy about how often the narrator chimed in and pointed out or explained the jokes.  I felt it would have been funnier with less narration (as in the first two seasons).  I guess this is the Arrested Development version of a laugh track to please network executives.

I thought the Rita story consumed too much of the last season and didn't show us anything new about Michael's character.  It was almost cartoonish.

My favorite episode was the last episode.  It had more of that Arrested Development flavor that I love.

I recommend purchasing this DVD just to find out what happens in the end.  It's probably best if you have some friends over and are in a goofy moood.  It will make the lackluster parts funnier.  The first two seasons are much better, though.",1160611200,8,1529,4.586715867158672

2544337,4,B000EXDS7K,"I ended up picking this up even though I have the third season on tape, both to get the higher quality and the extras.  While the higher quality is nice, the extras are pretty minimal.  I've never been a huge fan of commentary tracks, so while there are plenty of those they aren't particularly appealing to me.  The deleted scenes are very brief.  The blooper reel has its moments, and the last day of filming is fun to watch in a bittersweet way, but inessential.  Relative to other tv shows on dvd and given that the entire season is only 13 episodes at 22 minutes each, that's not a whole lot of content given the price.

In terms of show content, I think it's hard to claim that this isn't the weakest of the three seasons.  The limited number of episodes hurt it, but the general quality seems to have taken a bit of a downturn from the absolutely stellar season 2.  That's not to say it doesn't still have at least several hilarious moments per episode, and, let's face it, mediocre Arrested Development is still better than the best of practically any other tv show.

Season 1 and 2 were brilliant for many reasons. I have watched those DVDs MANY times and each time I laugh just as hard as the first time I saw them. I typically catch at least one joke I missed in previous viewings.

I didn't catch much of Season 3 on TV (due to Fox continually moving the time slot) so much of it was new to me as I sat and watched the DVDs. All I can say is , ""What happened?!"".

The storylines are too drawn out - How many Wee Britain/Mr. F. episodes do we need?

It is too farfetched - Tobias's Graft vs. Host disease was just plain stupid.

The jokes are not nearly as clever and are repeated ad nauseum - WE GET IT , Tobias likes men.

Next to Seinfeld the Series Finale of Arrested Development has to be the worst I have seen.

Lindsey is really not related to Michael and now she wants to sleep with him. WTF?

Lucille is able to pull the Queen Mary away from the dock in an effort to escape. WTF?

Also buying the DVDs are worth it because there are so many inside jokes you won't catch if you don't watch it two to three times unlike most shows with laugh tracks that tell you when to laugh.  If you like smart comedy like The Office, Seinfeld, or It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia then Arrested development is for you, but if you like the more stupid pointless humor shows that take up most of television like Two and a Half Men, According to Jim, King of Queens, Rodney, and The War at Home this is not the show for you.

It wasn't until I got the DVD's for season 1 and watched them all at once one weekend that I truly saw this series' genius.  It's like a sprawling comic novel that creates an entire goofy world that is the context for the outrageous (yet weirdly lovable) behavior of the Bluths, America's most dysfunctional wealthy family.  It should be compared to a book like John Kennedy Toole's ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" rather than the usual lame TV sitcom.  This sounds pretentious I know; but ""Arrested Development"" really is art that rewards your sustained attention.  Each episode of loaded with little jokes that only become apparent with repeated viewings (and the freeze-frame of a DVD player.)  The cumulative effect left me literally gasping with laughter, especially every time David Cross opens his piehole, so to speak.

This final, wonderful season has Oscar-winner Charlize Theron as Michael's hideously inappropriate fiance, a storyline that has you in stitches and cringing with embarassment at the same time.  I especially loved the classic episode ""S.O.B.'s"" in which the Bluths ponder their own unlikability and precarious ratings situation in a hilariously meta-fictional way (with Andy Richter guest-starring as the Richter brothers; you have to see it to believe it.)

Journalist Steven Johnson in his book ""Everything Bad Is Good For You"" says that today's popular culture (especially video games and other computer-based entertainment) is producing new generations of more cognitively sophisticated Americans.  You have to get smarter to appreciate complex, multifaceted and multitasking television shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Lost"".  The same applies to ""Arrested Development.""  Althogh in one sense the show is a throwback to the dense, novelistic demands of textual language, it's also the future of television comedy.

No. It still is one of the greatest shows of all time, and even though the show will live on forever for the sixty or so people who religiously watched it every week on three well packaged DVD sets, there is still a sense of sadness that is indeed it.

Season 3 of ""Arrested Development"" is as strong as seasons one and two and somehow it's even more complicated. It is nigh impossible to accuratley describe what goes on in this season to someone who hasn't watched yet, do not worry about a dip in quality. Although one episode here, the first one to establish the Charlize Thereon arc(although as it progresses it only gets better and better), is in my opinion the weakest in the shows cannon, the show never really falters. For proof take a look at the episode ""S.O.B.'s"" to see possibly one of the funniest(and at the same time saddest) half hours in the history of television.

The set includes a behind the scenes look at the last day on the set, which basically just has the actors looking sad, and three commentary tracks that follow the template of the ones featured on the first two seasons discs, but this is a show that really doesn't really need any shiny features to make it a worthy purchase. The show is enough in and of itself.

I love the actors. I wish Fox had retained all the original writers. In season three, the repetition of jokes went too far and the tone of humor went downhill; less subtle and refined, more nasty and crude. David Cross has great range; why limit him to a couple of joke themes? The character development was sometimes too inconsistent with the first two seasons. I would like to have seen the riches to rags theme given more emphasis. The show needed more of the documentary feel and believeability. If Mr. Hurwitz can recapture the magic of seasons one and two, I hope he will make a movie version.",1156896000,7,1211,5.459893048128342

The characters are so idiosyncratic and greedy yet so lovable and situations are just so absurd, it's incredibly hilarious. And the comedy is so well written: there's things with double meanings, so much irony, references to previous episodes and other shows, running jokes, and even foreshadowing! Where else can you find foreshadowing, for crying out loud? This show will make you laugh so hard you'll cry. If any show deserves to be bought on DVD, this is the one. Let's make it number one!

The subtle, sarcastic tone of the show will stay unmatched for years to come.  It is such an achievement to be funny in a real manner, rather than the basic formula we see in every TV show. I love every episode of Arrested Development and this DVD collection makes me appreciate it even more.  Jason Bateman is incredibly bright and his wit really blends into each character. Dave Cross and Will Arnett only intensified the humor and easily made the show irrestible.  I recommend this show and the other 2 seasons to everyone.

There is no need to reiterating point by point why this show was great, or how sad it is that the world was not ready for it so it was not picked up.  Anyone reading this knows these things, so it would be preaching to the choir.

I think one strength needs to be pointed out.  More than most T.V. to DVD compilations, the Arrested Development series has great re-watch ability.  This is not a joke show that hits you over the head with a punch line and then allows the laugh track to let you know it is time to chuckle.  The jokes are subtle and often layered.  Three people in the room watching this show can be laughing at the same time and everyone might be laughing about different things.  I have watched seasons one and two front to back at least three times, and each time I can't believe that I missed some comment, or reference or absurd juxtaposition of events that can bring out belly laughs.  The bottom line is that these DVDs will not be relegated to some shelf after one viewing (unless you are part the dense upper echelon of the FOX network), but will come out often and generate laughter each time like you are seeing them for the first time.

Be glad that we have the DVDs to prove to future T.V. watchers that all television didn't always suck... at least for a great but short three years in the early 21st century.",1156896000,,1466,4.278985507246377

2544368,5,B000EXDS7K,"It really is a shame that Fox decided to abandon Arrested Development.  I even started to think last year that maybe they were going to stick with Arrested Development until the very end.  I mean, even the Fox producers cannot deny that all Arrested really needed was to be shoved into the timeslot after American Idol for one season.  That way, when all 30 million viewers of American Idol decided to check out Arrested Development for just a couple of minutes, the rest of the country could have realized how funny it was.  But, alas, Fox decided to totally discard the show, even airing its series finale on a Friday night, the night of death in the TV world.  The only thing we can hope for now is that the success of the series on DVD motivates Fox or some other network to  re-up the show and give it the support it deserves from its network.

The 3rd season is probably the second best out of the 3, close behind season 2.  This season is by far the most over-the-top, and therefore it has some of the funniest moments of the show.  Season 2 can never be matched in some ways (Ann Veal, Mrs. Featherbottom, Tony Wonder) but season 3 does an admirable job of not only keeping the funny level at the top, but it also ends the show in a satisfying way.  The weirdest thing about this season was that, at the series finale, I found myself actually caring about the characters and what happened to them.  That normally doesn't happen for a comedy show, unless the show is Seinfeld.  And that really says a lot about the writers and actors on the show.

2544371,5,B000EXDS7K,"I still blame Fox.  Don't get me wrong - props to them for sticking around through three nearly-full seasons of poor ratings.  It's the best show in history.  A sitcom where continuity not only counts, but is essential?  Has that ever been done before, really?  If so - certainly not to the extent it's done here.

On a network that continues to air ""The War At Home"" and ""American Dad"" - two of the WORST shows on television now - Arrested Development didn't really stand a chance.  Fox has long pandered to the lowest-common denominator on weeknights.  Weekends, they've had the Simpsons/King of the Hill/the better episodes of Family Guy.  But during the week, AD didn't stand a chance.

What they should have done - after the 2nd season of poor ratings - was put it on Sunday nights INSTEAD of ""The War At Home.""  Why NO ONE thought of this baffles me.  Buzz about a potential film outing is encouraging - as is continued speculation of it being picked up by Showtime or HBO.  But there's enough injustice in the world as it is, Fox.  It wouldn't be so bad if you ONLY aired shows as good as, say, King of the Hill at least.  But no - when you continuously air crap and cancel the best parts of your television schedule.  Regardless of the ratings (which were low due to poor promotion and marketing, Fox network, a problem with should have been rectified immediately) - that's just ludicrous.  And irresponsible.  I mean - you guys bought out Myspace, you could've advertised for it on there, right?  I mean - you always say in press releases, etc., that you believe in the show - and love the show - but that the ratings just weren't there?  Whose fault is that, though?

I refuse to believe that this show was so good that people just weren't ready for it.  Maybe I just have too much faith in people, huh?

Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the good son of real estate tycoon George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) who is arrested for numerous criminal activities. While investigating his father's claim that he isn't the mastermind behind these criminal actions, Michael desperately tries to keep order among his unruly relatives and improve his relationship with his teenage son. Produced by acclaimed director Ron Howard, ""Arrested Development"" is the funniest well written comedy since ""Seinfeld"". Despite winning two Emmy awards, the critically acclaimed sitcom failed to find an audience since its premiere in 2003. The third season of ""Arrested Development"" was cut back to 13 episodes from its standard 22-episode season run. Though the third season isn't as outstanding as the earlier seasons, it still delivers some creative storylines, outrageous characters and uproariously funny moments. The final season also includes such memorable episodes like ""The Ocean Walker"", ""Making a Stand"", ""Family Ties"" and ""Development Arrested"".

It is fairly mind boggling that such a brillant comedy, with a great cast and tons of awards, could get kicked off the air... but it is utterly mind boggling how many horrible trashy sitcoms get to stay on the networks while the millons of AD fans are left with only three seasons.

Oh well, c'est la vie. At least we have DVDs to watch.

And AD is particularly suited to the DVD format as it is both highly narrative (for a sitcom) and highly self-referential. There are strong plot arcs that make you want to watch shows back to back and, more importantly, there are tons and tons of jokes that you will only get from repeated viewings. The self-referential humor (for example, how the house has blue handprints on the walls for the rest of the season after Tobias tries out for the Blue Man Group one episode) is just an example of the depth of comedy at work. Like The Big Lebowski or Mr. Show, this is comedy made to be watched again and again.

For fans of great comedy in general, Arrested Development is also exciting for its many great guest actors from other brillant comedies (including Upright Citizens Brigade, Seinfeld, Mr. Show and The Daily Show).

2544382,5,B000EXDS7K,"Three seasons of witty, genre-defying, unadulterated comedic bliss is a rarity in the current tv climate, and yet somehow Mitchell Hurwitz, Ron Howard and the talented cast and crew have managed to achieve just his. Few shows hit their stride as early as this one did. Not only was this show superbly realised from the start, it only gathered momentum from season to season, reaching this season three, where meta and self-referential humour are both bountiful and side-splittingly well delivered.

The third series sees Michael Bluth still trying to keep his dysfunctional family afloat, while trying to prove his father's innocence after he was charged with treason for building homes in Iraq. That is the bare-bones of the entire series really, but the hilarity lies in the bizzare antics of Michael's deranged family: Vodka-swilling, acid-tongued mother Lucille; Wily patriarch George Senior; layabout, part-time magician Gob; twin-sister and self-proclaimed activist Lindsay and her husband, the sexually ambiguous Tobias, and their rebel-without-a-cause daughter Maeby; overmothered younger brother Buster; and finally, Michael's own timid, naive son George Michael. Thats not to mention the excellent guest stars including Charlize Theron, who plays a mentally disabled English woman, and Scott Baiao as the deadpan attorney Bob Loblaw (say his surname fast and you'll get the joke). Simply watching such an eclectic cast of characters interact with eachother is a joy to behold, with the particular standout being Will Arnett's Gob, who is always a scene-stealer.

Arrested Development covers so much comedy ground, it's hard for anyone who appreciates well-conceived comedy to be disappointed. Slapstick, character, situational, arced, background gags and self-referential humour are all delivered adroitly, and at such a high velocity, that whenever the show makes you burst out laughing - which is very often - the chances are you've missed several other equally funny gags, such is the dense layering of the comedy. How Hurwitz and co pack so much hilarity into 21 minute installments never ceases to amaze. In my opinion, this is the best offering of the current wave of critically acclaimed American network comedies which includes Scrubs, the Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and My Name is Earl.

What is also the shows biggest strength is also its biggest downfall, at least in terms of wooing new viewers. This show is uncompromising for the casual viewer. You can't settle down and switch off your brain like you can with, say, an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond or Two and a Half Men. To fully appreciate how good this show is, attentive viewing is a must. I'm still picking up new jokes months after first watching the show, and I have watched these episodes pretty often in that time span. It's no coincidence that DVD sales have been through the roof; watching AD in 3 or 4 episodes blocks is a great way for a  new viewer to settle into the vibe of the show and start picking up the subtlties and nuances of the comedy that would be otherwise missed to an untrained eye. Not to mention that the plots are so zany and off-the-wall, that even veteran viewers of the show can find it hard to follow the story in one-episode-per-week doses.

A prime example of the quality of this show is episode 9. The plot seems simple enough - the Bluths are running out of money, and need to host a charity fundraiser in order to keep the family afloat. However, a savvy tv viewer will quickly realise this is an all-out extravaganza of meta-humour that satirizes the concept of ratings stunts, while also making light of the uncertain fate of the show. This exchange between Michael and his father is an example of this:
Michael - Hows that fundraiser going?
George - I don't think the Home Builders Organisation is going to support us
Michael - The HBO's not going to want us. Who else?
George - I think its Showtime. I think we should put on a show after dinner. Hey, maybe we can have celebrities in! You know, Oscar winners like Nicole Kidman...
Michael - I don't wanna just round up a bunch of famous people that have nothing to do with our family as some sort of cheap stunt. What has that got to do with us?
George - Nothing...
Every conceivable type of ratings stunt other tv shows to boost their flagging ratings is satirised in this episode as well; advertising for internet petitions, the use of 3-D glasses, pointless guest stars, the Bluths purposely becoming more ""sympathetic and relatable, because thats what everybody wants to see"", and a cut to a 'live feed' at end of the show. Narrator Ron Howard literally begs on two occasions, saying things like ""now thats a clear-cut situation with a promise of comedy. Tell your friends"".

Some AD aficionados claim season 3 to be the weakest of the three, though I have no idea why. I honestly can't fault any of the episodes except perhaps ""Prison Break-in"". Many of the episodes from this season are candidates for my top 5 list, such as ""Mr. F"", an episode whose climax is one of funniest and most bizzare instances of slapstick comedy I've ever seen. Despite FOX reducing episode order to only 13 episodes, the final two episodes of the season ""Exit Strategy"" and ""Harbouring Resentment"" are a well-rounded and satisfying end to a brilliant television series.",1154908800,11,5332,4.932071269487751

Of course, start with the first season because the show must be viewed chronologically in order to be fully appreciated and understood (many of the jokes build on one another). It is most likely for this reason that show was slower to develope a large viewing audience.  Although, the chronological style gives the show a very unique feel that helps make it hilarious.

This is(was, sadly) the best sitcom on tv during its airing and possibly of all time.  The characters are brilliantly designed, acted and developed; and the dynamics between the characters make for many of the funniest scenes and situations that have ever been aired on television.  The show's writing is also remarkable.  The humor builds upon itself.  Every joke not only delivers itself hilariously, but it is often subtly setting up more and more jokes and situations in the future.

In the first few episodes, it picked up right where Season Two left off - with the biting wit and startlingly clever jokes.  But it soon fell into the trap of trying to hold on to its time slot with a celebrity appearance.  Charlize Theron is hot and hysterical, but when the storyline starts to revolve around her and Michael, the rest of the characters are neglected and the jokes become stale.

As the producers realized their inevitable fate of cancelation, they began to prepare.  In the final four episodes, they essentially let loose every joke they'd been writing and saving for subsequent seasons.  The result is a quadruplet of hysterics.

The cast seemed to mesh more this season... Their third year together. The third year shows were inventive, quirky and well written. The cast, which included Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walters and Jason Bateman (all in top form), made this emsemble piece great TV. I blame FOX tv for not cradling such a show, as CBS did for JAG which ran for 10 seasons.

so is this box set worth your time-YES. However if you haven't started from season one, get season one and two box set first

the sad thing is I wish HBO or showtime would have continued this show, rather than some others that have on their schedule. ALAS another great witty show for people with brains goes down the tubes

AD could have changed the world of entertainment as we know it. It was ahead of its time. It was flawless. Yet the world shunned it as if it had some sort of disease.

It is nothing less than a crime that shows like the OC, The Simple Life, and Survivor can last year after year and yet AD could last only three.

George Sr.: Yeah, the HBO's not gonna want us. What do we do now?

2544425,5,B000EXDS7K,"DVDs were pretty much invented so those few ARRESTED... fans could enjoy their favorite show over and over.  What a brilliant series!!!  Thank God I can watch it again.  In Season 3, Fox moved this show around so many times, I had trouble taping all of them on my old-school VCR  (although I'm sure glad I got the last 4 episodes, even though Fox buried them next to the opening ceremony of the Olympics and then didn't advertise them).  BUT, you fans out there know how great it is to have them on DVD.

Season 3 was stellar.  I've read a little griping that the quality slipped a little...okay, maybe from A+++ to A+.  Still pretty darn good.  The only story line that tired me a little bit was the stuff with Charlize Theron.  She's a decent actress, but I found her British accent unconvincing, and I thought the story line went on too long.

Other than that, I've got no complaints.  The episode where George Michael ends up in a retro looking flying jetpack, and flies over a miniature model home park while crashing into Tobias dressed in a monster costume was so funny I wept.  No joke.  I did not think it was possible to find 30 seconds of TV so funny.  We watched it over and over.

The final four episodes, when the story finally wrapped itself up pretty well, include wonderful trips to Iraq, fantastic guest appearances (including a very nice turn from Justine Bateman) and crisp, crisp acting all around.

It's almost futile to describe the show.  If you haven't seen it, you MUST watch it, but you must start with Disc 1.  My family and I have had ARRESTED marathons...when Season 1 came out, we watched in one day, and later the same with Season 2.  I know season 3 will be the same.  They fly by, and you can see all the many little jokes you missed the first time, mostly because you were too busy laughing at the other jokes.  This is NOT an exaggeration...the show is that packed with energy.

Yes, it is a shame to see it go.  I'll miss all the incredibly talented cast and characters.  But in some ways, it might be a blessing.  I can only imagine the creative and logistical effort that went into it...how could that be sustained?  And even though Fox kinda gave up on it mid season...they DID promote it a lot before then.  And magazines raved about it.  And it cleaned up award after award.  But people didn't tune in...you can't blame Fox for cutting its losses (although WHY ""The War at Home"" or ""Stacked"" lasted more than 2 episodes each I don't know).  Remember, Fox has stuck by ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""King of the Hill"" for many years past when their ratings dropped.  Overall, I can't be too upset with them.

I'd sure feel different, though, if ARRESTED wasn't out on DVD!!  This is a MUST OWN if there ever was such a thing!!  SEE IT!!!!",1144886400,79,2777,4.410256410256411

It clearly didn't match up to season 2, and was nowhere near season 1, which was probably the best season in the history of sitcoms, period.  Minute for minute, season 1 was perfect.  But the writers and cast started to panic halfway through season 2 when Fox still wasn't promoting the show, and took an understandable guess that the network wanted zanier plotlines and as many jokes as could be crammed into 22 minutes, regardless of how it affected the flow.  Introducing Rita as Michael's love interest was a sad diversion - Charlize Theron can't pull off a Brit to save her life - and the episodes were generally full of overacting.  That said, season 3 was still better than 95% of TV that year, and I'll be getting the DVD when it comes out.  Fox has no one to blame but itself for the show's demise, refusing to promote it, continually sticking it with bad timeslots, and keeping the writers and cast in constant limbo over its future.  As Tim Goodman in the SF Chronicle said, the network was scared out of its mind that another network would make the show a ratings hit, and decided leaving it alone to die was better than freeing it for a network that would truly cultivate it.

2544429,5,B000EXDS7K,"This is one of the funniest, wittiest shows to ever be on television.

There are some good summaries already posted here on Amazon, so I'll focus on how I think the DVDs are worthy of purchase.

Some of the jokes are very subtle, some are very obvious. This show demands that you watch each episode more than once, as many of the jokes become more apparent in a second or third viewing. You just can't catch them all the first time. Also, there is a lot of very subtle foreshadowing in many episodes.

I will never tire of watching this show. It is guaranteed to give you many belly laughs and funny one-liners you'll never forget. There are jokes in this show that make me laugh so hard that I get tears in my eyes, even the third or fourth time I've seen them.

Every time I loan AD DVDs to friends to watch, they are instantly addicted and mesmerized by the brilliant comedy - the writing, acting, and production. This comedy is about as perfect as I could imagine a show could be.

Season three is very different than the first two seasons. At first, I wasn't overwhelmed with excitement by the new storyline (which included Charlize Theron), but it ended up working quite well. Later episodes even make fun of how it was foolish to save the company (i.e. series) by bringing in a bunch of famous people who had nothing to do with the family.

Previous DVD sets include a lot of background and information. I hope that this DVD set will also include wonderful extras.

Alas, the show officially ended its run today - creator Mitch Hurwitz announced that he will not continue with the series. Fortunately, the show was wrapped up brilliantly in the final episodes on this DVD set.

I can't recommend this series highly enough, particularly to those who like fast-paced, witty and sometimes ribald comedy.",1143504000,10,1807,4.572755417956657
2544430,5,B000EXDS7K,"As an avid fan of this show, I realize rewatching episodes is an important part of appreciating and properly judging the true genius of Arrested Development.

Certain episodes I am even ashamed of, such as ""Prison Break-In"" and ""Fakin' It.""  After all, I hold this show to the incredibly high standards it consitently set up for itself.

HOWEVER... There is more genius in these 13 episodes than in any other comedy in the history of television (besides AD Seasons 1 and 2) and most comedies in movie history as well.  Also, three of the episodes are not victims of this drop in quality AT ALL (""The Ocean Walker, ""S.O.B.s"", and ""Development Arrested"") and would have been highlights in the first two seasons.

2544433,5,B000EXDS7K,"Warning:  A world of spoilers

We just learned on Mar. 24 that Michael Hurwitz has declined to run ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT on Showtime, which means that the show as we knew it for the past three years truly has ended.  Showtime's offer to renew the show on their network was contingent upon Hurwitz staying with the show.  If they stick with that requirement, the show truly is done.  Executive Producer (and Narrator) Ron Howard has indicated that he would like to keep the show alive and that Hurwitz has agreed to stay on as a consultant if Howard is able to work out a deal with Showtime to continue the show on other terms.  So, while things are looking bleak, the Fat Lady hasn't sung quite yet.  She is, however, warming up in the wings.  And to be honest, I'm not sure how I would feel about ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT without Michael Hurwitz.  It would be like BUFFY without Joss Whedon or LOST without Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse (forget J. J. Abrams, they are the ones running the show).  Still, I'd definitely give it a try.  A show isn't made by only one person, and it is possible that if the cast stayed with the show and much of the rest of the creative team, the show might yet continue to catch lightening in a bottle.

With one qualification, I utterly disagree with those who saw a decline in Season Three.  To me the plot lines were getting better, not worse.  The episodes involving Charlize Theron were for me among the finest in the entire run of the show, funny both as a general plot line and hysterical in the almost impossible number of details.  These, like those of the first two seasons, are episodes that you can watch repeatedly, picking up new details along the way.  For instance, when Michael and Rita go to the ""American"" restaurant in Little England they are served what I imagine to be their version of ""authentic"" American cuisine.  In front of each of them is a plate filled with impossibly sugary looking donuts.  The brilliance of the show is that they don't call any attention to the absurd ""meal"" but leave it in the background.  I will grant, however, that in the final four episodes the plot lines started feeling a bit rushed, as they were forced not only to collapse the season's plot into only a few episodes but create an appropriate ending for the series as a whole in case they decide not to continue the show on Showtime.  In that sense the third season falls a tiny bit short of the others, but I have to cut them some slack here.  If they had had a full 22 episodes or even the 18 that Season Two had I think it would have equaled the first two in every way.

Season Three, in fact, is in some ways the funniest of the three seasons.  The jokes became even more cutting and painfully funny.  Even now I can't think of Bob Boblaw (if you haven't seen those episodes say the name out loud) without snickering, let alone Tobias's comment:  ""Bob Boblaw's web log.  Wow, you're a mouthful.""  Our learning of the mysterious ""Mr. F"" and the eventual denouement is one of the best moments in the series, as well as one of the saddest.  A host of images from the season are impossible for me to forget.  Gob's puppet with the sign reading ""George Bush doesn't care for black puppets"" hanging around its neck.  Tobias's unhappy experience in getting hair plugs.  Or Michael asking George-Michael, in a wonderful parody of the first episode:

Michael:  What have I always said is the most important thing?

George-Michael:  Family.

Michael:  No, breakfast.

Other funny moments include Lindsay's stating that she had to finish a bottle of vodka because, as her mother had taught her, if you didn't drink a bottle once opened it would go bad.  Also, that wine turned into alcohol if you didn't drink it quickly.  Funniest of all, and perhaps the scene that caused me to laugh harder than I have on anything else I have ever seen on American TV, was the utterly strange, surreal encounter between what appeared to be looking out the window of the model home a fight between a gigantic mole monster and some strange massive alien with a jet pack.

One thing that wasn't always commented on was the fact that unlike situation comedies, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT did have a definite story to tell.  The story wasn't the main point, but it did structure everything that was done in the three seasons.  Briefly, we learn that George Bluth was falsely arrested for having committed treason through building houses for Saddam Hussein.  We also learn that Michael and Lindsay were not really twins as they had always imagined and that George-Michael and Maebe, who accidentally married one another, were not biologically related.  By the end of the day, it was one heck of a wild ride.

I sincerely hope that Michael Hurwitz will take Showtime's offer.  In my opinion this truly is the finest comedy in the history of American TV and can only be rivaled by MONTY PYTHON and FAWLTY TOWERS in British television.  The show is still incredibly fresh and full of potential for more insanity and nuttiness.  With so many bad things in the world, the human race could stand a few more laughs.

The whole ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT debacle adds another chapter in the tacky history of FOX.  The network has done a great job of development fascinating and innovative shows, but all too often abuses them.  FOX truly has become the network that a host of people absolutely loathes and detests.  I am still bitter over the early cancellation of FIREFLY, which might have become one of the most fascinating shows in the history of TV.  Ditto with WONDERFALLS, cancelled after only four episodes were broadcast, though thirteen were filmed.  Or going back further, the cancellation of DARK ANGEL after only two seasons, or the cancellation of FAMILY GUY and FUTURAMA (though massive DVD sales did bring FAMILY GUY back).  Now we can add ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT to the list.  How FOX could fail to value and promote and treasure what is quite probably the finest comedy America has ever produced is beyond me.  You would think that a show that in only two seasons had won a shelf of Emmys and Golden Globes would have been immune to cancellation.  But never put anything past FOX.  It isn't just the shows that FOX disrespects:  they disrespect us fans.",1142726400,18,6258,4.624319419237749
2544434,5,B000EXDS7K,"I'll be brief since nothing more needs to be said: This is without a doubt one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. The third season was no exception, despite what one or two obsessed fans would have you to believe. Every episode was as hysterical and fantastic as the previous one. I'll take three seasons (only one of which was a full order) of AD over ANY generic sitcom that's on today. For 50+ episodes Arrested Development was perhaps the finest sitcom that ever aired, but only history will tell. If that's the case, AD has no where to go but up.",1142467200,10,553,4.378640776699029
2544435,5,B000EXDS7K,"First of all, I would just like to say that I am NEVER WATCHING FOX AGAIN for what they did to this show.  Season three was on its way to putting the first two seasons to shame before Fox cut the order down to thirteen episodes and the producers were forced to go into makeshift mode.  However, these episodes are every bit as great as anything from the first two seasons.  In many ways, season three was more complicated, innovative and experimental than the other two seasons.  The cast is flawless, but Jason Bateman in particular is near-perfect, hitting the bullseye with every single line.  The first episode manages to lay quite a bit of groundwork for the season while still being hilarious, and it does so effortlessly.  It is a great piece of writing.  I am at a loss to explain why so many people did not care for the five episodes Charlize Theron guest starred in.  She was extremely funny and somehow managed to create a character with three personalities - all displayed simultaneously.  Every line she says fits Michael's interpretation of her (perfect girl), ours (spy) and the truth (wee brain).  There are two other episodes that are highly creative and unique.  One probaby has the darkest comedy of the series (Tobias terminally ill in a way that is grotesque and absurd); the other has some very distinct editing and multiple surprise endings that have both the audience and the characters equally confused right up until the end.  The ninth episode is nothing short of amazing, hilariously self-referential, spoofing countless desperate attempts to grab ratings.  If the last four episodes end up being the last episodes of the series, this is undoubtedly one of the best endings of any television show.  Before the episodes aired, I could not imagine how they could possibly play things out with so little space.  Anyone with any sort of interest in writing screenplays for television needs to see these episodes.  Masterful does not even begin to describe how so many different stories are swiftly concluded in ways that are ingenius, hilarious and satisfying.",1142467200,16,2084,4.877840909090909
2544436,5,B000EXDS7K,"Season 3 is the cause of much debate among Arrested Development fans. Some claim it is terrible, while others love it. And while season 3 is different from the previous two, I don't think it should be written off solely based on ""difference"". There are many, many great moments in season 3, which unfortunately has become the end of this brilliant series.

Because a new team of writers had to be assembled between the end of season 2 and the start of season 3, the season did start off somewhat below par, and a few recurring jokes were overused. However, by the end of the shortened (13 episode) season, the show was back on par with the best of both previous seasons, and in some places had out done them. And for that, it deserves the highest possible rating.

The season starts off with the aftermath of George Michael and Maeby's kiss, George Sr.'s escape and Oscar's imprisonment. Michael investigates the British conspiracy his father claims to be a ""patsy"" for, and ends up falling in love with a charming British woman named Rita, played by Charlize Theron, whom is keeping a secret of her own. Tobias gets hairplugs that slowly begin to kill him, so the family throws a fund raiser for him at the prison where George Sr. had once been incarcerated. Michael and Gob team up to teach George Sr a lesson, but Buster gets the best of them all. Andy Richter helps at another fundraiser, this time, to help the Bluths save their company. It all comes to a head in the final four episodes where we learn the truth about the Bluth's legal troubles, someone in the family gets married, someone ends up in a coma, someone finds out they're not really a Bluth, and everyone's favorite adopted Korean son returns in a shocking twist (but as always, the clues were there all along).

Despite all the setbacks cast and crew were made to endure by the fine executives at Fox (I swear - all of my favorite shows have been cancelled by them), it is a great watch. Arrested Development's third season proves that in the face of adversity, the creators, writers, cast, and crew were able to roll with the punches, and give us another great season of television's finest comedy.",1142208000,4,2169,4.585051546391752

Wish Amazon would let Prime users have access to later series so I could continue watching. Can't afford $2 for each 20 minute episode, that's a dollar a minute!",1465948800,,328,4.875
