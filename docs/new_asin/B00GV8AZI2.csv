And Buddy her dog almost stole the show. Recommended it to my mom and she now wants a DVD. All I can say is The Wedding Pact is a great little movie that men will have no trouble watching with their wives or girlfriends. With all the horror sex and violence in today's films, what a treat to find this little gem. Bravo.",1392422400,6,484,4.105263157894737

6118814,3,B00GV8AZI2,"I liked that the male lead wasn't your typical ""pretty boy"".  It made it more believable that he would lack the confidence to admit to the girl that he was interested in more than just friendship.  I did feel, as some people have expressed, that some of the acting wasn't as good as it could have been (mostly from supporting characters).  Spoiler alert: I think making the girl's fiance such a jerk made her decision a duh.

So... this was bad. Haylie's character seemed great, but the situations that the lead guy found himself in didn't really fit with a romantic comedy.

6118836,2,B00GV8AZI2,"I was disappointed with this movie. One of the things that stood out the most was at one point she says she is completely uninterested in politics and voting, and then she says she is a social worker.  Social worker's are often very aware and involved in politics because social workers look at how all systems influence their clients.  This is not realistic. The writer's do not know much about the actual profession of social work or to learn much about it.  As a social work student, I was very frustrated.",1506988800,,509,4.571428571428571

BUT, I like Haylie Duff. Her little sister gets the lion's share of publicity so I think Haylie deserves her due. I think she is  good actress, this movie just wasn't a good vehicle for her. I also loved the movie Material Girls in which she and Hilary played onscreen sisters, so sue me curmudgeons :)",1506297600,2,479,4.443181818181818
6118840,1,B00GV8AZI2,"Perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. From the lackluster acting to the terrible cinematography, you won't find much in this film besides disappointment and frustration, all wrapped up in cliches and a predictable storyline- and don't get me started on the outrageous plot holes/nonsensical plot points. The script is like something a freshman film major would put together. Unless you want to torture yourself with mediocre acting and a below average plot, don't waste your time. TLDR: don't watch",1505952000,,518,5.105882352941176

The overall story is sweet, seemed like it should have been a cute movie, but there's was so much pointless other crap in there.  There were all these scenes on the guy's journey across the country that I couldn't have cared less about.  And I don't understand why those two characters were even needed to help at the end.  It was just pointless and super stupid. Plus the acting is terrible.  It's sad when I'm watching it and think ""Well, that one guy, his acting is decent.""

6118847,3,B00GV8AZI2,"OK, I must admit that I thought this was Hilary Duff - I kept wondering why she looked so different! LOL, yes wine was involved.

Anyway, this movie was VERY cheesy and unbelievable.  Boy meets girl, he falls in love but they're just friends.  They make a pact to marry each other in 10 years if they are still single.  He tracks her down, but she's getting married in 10 days.  Her fiance is a douchebag and crazy things happen from there.

6118851,1,B00GV8AZI2,"Can I give zero stars?  Hahaha there was so much second-hand embarrassment from this movie that I had to walk my dog looking over my shoulder the whole time, hoping no one knew I actually just watched it all the way through.  It was like one of the god-awful cheese-fest Hallmark movies- you just can't stop watching, no matter how hard you try!  Soooooooo bad.  That saddened me, because I love the Duffs, and I was hoping Haylie would get to play a strong, winning female lead. Pfft.

Firstly, can I beg the people who made this movie to GO TO TEXAS AND TALK TO AT LEAST 3 PEOPLE IN A METROPOLITAN AREA??? Texans who have seen this are all offended by your portrayal.  Heaven's Angels??? Seriously??? In ""taupe"" robes???? As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure the Duffs are originally from Houston, so I'm shocked Haylie allowed such a disgusting frivolous depiction take place.  I hope she got paid bank for it.

If you're like me, then you thought, oh, here's a dumb little romcom I can watch while I get some work done... it doesn't have to be 4- or even 3-star worthy... just something silly and a little romantic to get me through the next hour and a half of tediousness.  THINK AGAIN!  It. Was. Awful. Below is a random list of words that should not only sum up the movie, but leave you feeling the way this movie left me feeling:

6118854,1,B00GV8AZI2,"I've seen worse, but it's been a while. Acting was embarrassingly bad, especially the supporting cast.
The general idea of movie wasn't bad which is why I decided to watch, but the script and way the story was told will make you shake your head and wonder how this ever made it to release.
Angie Everheart trying to do a Texas accent but then the more lines she has the more the accent fades just makes you feel sorry for her. But I blame the director, he should have just said it's not working speak in your normal voice. And why was she at the rest-stop watching him take a leak anyway? Why would people who live near a rest-stop hang out at one?  You have nothing better to do I guess? It made me realize surely I can think of something better to do than watch the rest of this movie. A little bit past the half way point I did finally stop it.

The story is built on the premise that a guy and girl made a 10-year marriage pact in college.

She has forgotten and is marrying a rich jerk because she and mom are going to lose their house.

Enter the rich fiance who buys their house, allowing them an uncomfortable degree of security, as long as the girl marries rich jerk.

Marriage pact guy and girl spend 10 pre-wedding days together before she is due to marry the rich jerk. She falls for marriage pact guy.

In the end, marriage pact guy gets pact-girl but it is not explained how she and/or mother remain stable.

The rich jerk is now out of the picture and pact-guy is not portrayed as terribly wealthy.

I'm a big fan of rom-coms, but this is neither romantic nor funny. Personally I wouldn't feel very flattered that some sleazy guy went on a road trip to marry sad old me after 10 years. Especially not this one. Dunno if they were trying to show the many 'temptations' along the way, but for me it just cemented the guy as a player feeling sorry for himself. Calling every girl Elizabeth for 10 years isn't romantic - that's stupid. If you wanted to be with her you could have done something - see Serendipity ~ A Lot Like Love ~ Forces of Nature ~ While You Were Sleeping... and so on.

6119078,1,B00GV8AZI2,"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this to the end, that's just stupidity on my behalf. I don't understand the logic behind this movie. *SPOILER ALERT*  A bunch of 30 year olds are graduating from college, where they're bring out a keg on campus, super realistic. Two best friends from college make a half hearted wedding pact. The guy claims to have fallen in love with her the moment he saw her, which is ridiculous because he knows absolutely nothing about her so he's clearly thinking with his other head. Fast forward 10 years, the guy is having a birthday dinner where the decorations look like it was bought from Party City. His roommate from college shows up and as a present gives him a photo of him and the girl with her address on the back of it. He then decides it's time to find her and collect on their marriage pact. He starts to head to the address on the photo when his friend calls him and tells him she's actually in Hawaii. So he buys a $600 ticket to Hawaii, that ends up going to waste because surprise surprise, she's actually not there! So he gets a call from his friend and she's actually in some other location that I'm not even going to try to recall. So he starts to drive there, stops at a rest stop with no other cars or people there and proceeds to urinate off the mountain. I thought the purpose of a rest stop was so you can urinate indoors. Anyways, a random woman rides to the rest stop on a bike and tries to seduce him. Then she insists he stays the night at her bed and breakfast. How convenient. So he finally arrives at his destination. The college friends haven't spoken for 10 years and yet when he shows up at her house and she still considers him her best friend. Okay fine, that makes perfect sense. And the part I really don't get is how come there are scenes where the two are kissing mouth to mouth like it's perfectly normal for two best friends (one of which, engaged) to kiss like that. They also snuggled together but that I can almost overlook. The mom looks like she's wearing a cheap wig from a children's dress up shop. The only character I liked was the dog.",1471564800,21,2122,4.305

If she liked you, buddy, she would have kept in contact for more than 5 minutes post-graduation.

They make jokes about how it's not creepy, it's ""romantic"" - but telling me it's not creepy isn't exactly convincing.

6119396,5,B00GV8AZI2,"I think we all remember what our reaction was at the news that Haylie Duff would be starring in a romantic comedy opposite the multifaceted Chris Soldevilla: who the %$#! is Chris Soldevilla? All joking aside, of course we remember him from his stellar performance in the 2000 classic ""Coyote Ugly"" and eagerly anticipated his performance as Mitch in this film. We were not disappointed. Through forceful performances like this movie, Soldevilla has quietly built a reputation as a major player in the comedy genre, even as he has expanded his range in drama through such vehicles as ""7 Minutes"" (2014). We all eagerly anticipate future entries in the Soldevilla oeuvre.

But as flawless and nuanced as Soldevilla is in ""The Wedding Pact,"" the real acting tour de force in this film comes from Haylie Duff. We all see in Duff the depth and range of a young Meryl Streep and the wit and witticisms of a youthful Joan Blondell. She doesn't disappoint in this outing. As Elizabeth, Duff has solidified her position as the grand dame of romantic comedies, rivaling the comedic talents of such actresses as Carole Lombard and Edna Purviance.

And who can forget Matt Berman, the wunderkind writer/producer who made this all possible. We all know him from the 2000 masterpiece ""F.A.R.T.: The Movie,"" which the AMPAS shocking passed over in its nominations for a Best Director Oscar. Sam Mendes got lucky with ""American Beauty"" that year and we all know it. Travesties aside, the Academy will simply not be able to look the other way at Berman's brilliance in ""The Wedding Pact"" and maintain itself as a legitimate organization.

One cannot find a more scrumptrulescent outing than ""The Wedding Pact."" Watch and be amazed; talent like this doesn't come along often.",1468454400,,1758,4.9324324324324325

I really thought it might have been financed by Hilary Duff as a vehicle for her sister, using their friends and family in the cast, that's how bad the acting and the plot is. In the first scene we encounter a group of 30-something looking ""college students"" celebrating graduation. Guy and girl who are friends offhandedly make a wedding ""pact"" agreeing that if they have no better prospects in 10 years, they will marry each other. Pretty romantic, right? Wrong! Fast forward ten years and the male lead (who looks like an insurance salesman) is at his birthday party 10 years later when his friend from college shows up. This guy is afraid to fly so his friend tells him he should drive across the country to California to see his sweetheart, but only to Texas, where he is waylaid by a middle-aged redhead at a rest stop--a rest stop without bathrooms, obviously, because he gets out of the car to urinate at the edge of the parking lot. This redhead, who has pedaled up on a bicycle, TO A REST STOP, invites him to her place. I have no idea--why. Somewhere along the line the plans change and the girl is now in Hawaii so he buys a plane ticket and then cancels after realizing he has shared a bottle of booze with the pilot in the waiting area.

The love story is non existent-- the movie focuses on the main guy and his road trip to see Haylie Duff's character.
Haylie and the lead guy share like 15 minutes total screen time.

I was thinking that this would be a cute chick flick/Hallmark style movie-- forget it! And definitely not family friendly, unless your kids like fighting, drug use, a girl in lingerie stripper dancing, another girl straddling the main guy, a couple doing it in the back of the main guys car, and the fiancee snorting coke and downing shots-- wholesome family fun!!!

6119997,1,B00GV8AZI2,"I don't want to be one of those reviewers that comes out of the dark to just bash a film. I get the whole film process. Someone has a vision, a pretty decent idea, it gets green lit, the cast and crew come together, investors pitch in to get the thing up and running, etc, etc. I hate to slam movies for being terrible when I know a lot of hard work goes into something, and people were just trying to bring their vision to life; whether it be for riches or just the sake of the art. This wasn't for the sake of the art.

The film has a cute premise about a guy and a girl making a pact that if they're not married in ten years, that they'll marry one another. Cute, right? Seems like a family film for all to sit around with popcorn to watch and share a few laughs. WRONG! This film didn't know what it wanted to be. That was my MAIN, MAIN ISSUE! First of all; The film promotes its two female stars: Angie Everhart (90's Swimsuit model, beautiful red head, erotic thriller actress) and Haylie Duff; who is more so known for her famous, Disney sister, Hilary. Oh, and she was semi-relevant ten years ago with Napoleon Dynamite. Has anyone heard of what Jon Heder is up to these days? Anyway, the film markets this as a family comedy, but it's WAY FAR from that. It's like a bunch of frat boys got together and projected out their own fantasies, and wanted this to be a guys movie with a cute female lead, but to mask it as a female comedy that guys may like, yet trick people thinking it's family friendly, only to have it massacred with poor sexual overtones and innuendos...and BAD WRITING! I'm in a tailspin from writing that. That's how jumbled it is.

I love a good R rated comedy. I wish the studios had the balls to make them like they did in the past few decades (70's, 80's, 90's). However, whoever wrote this, doesn't understand women. I am no extreme, radical feminist, but the women that were portrayed in this were God-awful. Throughout the film, I kept thinking it was going to turn into porno at any moment. (Hey, writer and director, there's a good calling), so I was confused. The female characters came off as only serving one purpose; being sexual beings, damsels in distress that can't think for themselves, or a motherly figure. For example: Angie's character thrusting herself on the male lead not even twenty minutes in for no real reason, a random, I'm assuming hooker, thrusting herself on the male lead and then having sex in the car, and a woman feeding a man grapes in lingerie while making a BJ innuendo at the end. This seemed to be a man's fantasy . I got chills down my spine just in embarrassment for all that were involved in this project. You'll know what scenes I'm talking about. Just watch the first fifteen minutes.

I think the leads in this film were decent, overall. The lead male in this film was likable and dynamic. He's a good sidekick, comedy actor. It's a shame he was wasted with this material, as he grated on my nerves after his excessive whining only twenty minutes in. Haylie was a good eye candy and gave a very subtle performance. She's not a bad actress. But note to director and camera people; NEVER shoot/film a woman from the chin up, especially when the camera adds 10-20 pounds. I thought the actor that portrayed her smug fianc&eacute; to be very convincing. I've seen his other work and he somehow came out a bit unscathed from the writing. Maybe whoever wrote his smug and cheap character understood him more, therefore, the actor had more wiggle room with the writer. Angie Everhart was cute, but type-cast as a sexual fantasy and lost her Arkansas accent halfway through the movie. She was there for the pay check. Don't blame her. Actors need work, too! Leslie Easterbrook, who played the mom, is from THE DEVILS REJECTS! She was solid, but was destroyed with a bad wig. I hope this film paid her rent and I'll always support her! The script was weak, the directing was flimsy, the cast for the most part did not come out of this unscathed, the editing was choppy, the storyline was too rushed and not cohesive. The soundtrack was decent though, as I was expecting 70's porno music to pop up at any moment. The film didn't have an identity, and I don't know what crowd or target audience it was intended for. I also thought maybe more than one person went into writing this script and directing this, therefore, leaving too many cooks in the kitchen which cause a train wreck like this, or it was one person projecting out their own fantasies in a sloppy manner. I was right. Written and directed by the same person. I rest my case. Maybe this will get reviewed by MST3k. I'd actually only purchase this film to hear the commentary. Now that's where one would pop some pop corn, grab their favorite bottle of liquor, and get their laughs. But I would sue for my seventeen dollars and sanity.

6119999,5,B00GV8AZI2,"I truly enjoyed this movie.... Yes, it is a chick flick, but with some humor and romance!  Many of us do or think about doing this pact with our besties!!  This really is a great take on what we were/are all thinking!!  Great date movie....watch it!!  :)",1392768000,2,254,4.340425531914893
6120000,5,B00GV8AZI2,"This is a great feel good/date movie with plenty of laughs and romance!!  I loved the scene when Mitch is smashed in the face with the door when he arrives in CA.  You can just tell that Elizabeth and he belong together!  Yes, it is a chick flick, but in a different way.  I truly enjoyed it!!  :)",1392768000,,297,4.051724137931035

6120002,2,B00GV8AZI2,"I love movies, even cheesey movies. Trust me, I love cheesey romantic movies! But this was a little too much for me! I tried to make it through the whole thing, but I had to stop half-way through. A guy & a girl in college promise to marry each other in 10 years if they are still single. Ten years later, the guy embarks on a mission to find the girl. The acting was terrible, the story line stupid & just not worth my time or the $3.99 I wasted on renting it.",1392768000,,461,3.967741935483871
6120003,5,B00GV8AZI2,"How many of us made this silly little pact when we were younger never to follow through because of course, life happens! This is a very sweet, adorable, funny movie about a man who follows though with a pact. Haylie Duff is adorable and there are genuine laugh out loud moments. A very good solid film. I loved it!",1392508800,4,314,4.338983050847458

8627745,5,B00GV8AZI2,I don't care for movies with nudity or profanity so I enjoyed this movie because it was more wholesome than a lot of what's available today (minus the scene with the whipped cream and nighty). I still wouldn't recommend this for children. Of course it was predictable but it was still interesting.,1531699200,,297,4.730769230769231

8627747,1,B00GV8AZI2,"Overall this movie had potential as a typical romantic comedy, though one with a few over the top situations along the way.  Unfortunately it was spoiled by bad everything else (bad acting, editing, sound, camera work, ....), the scenes all feel like we are watching someone with a handheld camera film the actors doing a first read through, and even then doing it poorly.",1527724800,,372,4.8125

8627750,4,B00GV8AZI2,I saw a lot of negative reviews i don't agree i think it was a good movie it was light hearted fun and had a great ending. I was pleased with it not a lot of swearing ect. Love is the best ending of all.,1525046400,,203,3.533333333333333
