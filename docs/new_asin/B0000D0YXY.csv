Thin plot consisting of various sexual couplings and not much else.  Setting not believable, Berenger miscast, even the musical score is not good.  Skip it.",1276819200,2,283,4.833333333333333

1920356,3,B0000D0YXY,"A solid 3 star show with lots to smile about. A fun film set in both funny & not so funny circumstances. The theme of a young man helped out of virginity by an older woman is as old as can be but a whole movie about a man scared of women his own age is priceless. Mind you I have no trouble believing it happens in real life but was surprised it ever happened in reel life.

I'm sure the stars here had a great deal of fun making this show & it, dare we say it ""comes out"" in their performances. Each individual segment seemed a bit trite to me but the sum of them all was poignant as the credits rolled. There were places the director & writer could have gone wrong & it never happens. I felt they showed what the story required & did not error in what they allowed on screen. This is an adult story & if full nudity bothers you or your distraught by other than missionary coitus you should avoid this.

I would have rated this show higher but these characters did not require much depth. It is still a great fun show & shouldn't be judged to critically or prudishly. Let's make it 3 1/2 stars.",1264896000,,1095,4.064814814814815
1920357,4,B0000D0YXY,"This hard to find movie shows ""the promise"" of Tom Berenger's career. He was fun to watch as he beds one lady after another. It's also fun to see a sexy movie without a lot of politically correct thought.

As he grows older, each lady has an imapct on his life and brings more aspects of his character into view.

All in all, this is just a fun sexy romp reflecting the times and history.",1206230400,6,388,4.16
1920358,5,B0000D0YXY,I know the movie was made almost 30 years ago. However it definately portrayed sexual understanding or lack of it in some cases based on experience and individual maturity. A little far fetched but an entertaining movie. Most men and some women knows someone like the main charachter.,1150156800,10,284,4.9375
1920359,3,B0000D0YXY,"Actually, O. B. Tryggvason, a DVD version of this movie has been released (got mine at Walmart). That's how I got to know this movie. All in all, I think it's quite decent. On contrar, D. Mikels, considering this movie is only rated R (and not other adult categories), I would consider this movie quite steamy even for today's standard.",1137196800,3,336,4.616666666666666
1920360,4,B0000D0YXY,"In this movie, a young Tom Berenger portrays a young man in Post-World War II Hungary who falls in and out of love with numerous older women.  His character's infatuation with older women begins as a child during the war, when he loses his virginity to a middle-aged prostitute.  From there, he moves to Budapest to go to college, and moves in with an older woman, portrayed by Karen Black.  They fall in love with each other.  Then the woman's best friend, portrayed by Canadian stage actress and artist Marilyn Lightstone, joins them in social events.  Eventually, Ms. Lightstone's character seduces Berenger's character, and in a memorable scene of seduction, she entices him to have sex with her on the living room floor.  But Ms. Black's character catches them in the act, and she breaks up with Berenger's character and kicks him out.  Berenger then falls in love with a female resistance leader during the 1956 Hungarian Crackdown by Russian troops and tanks.  She departs for deep cover, and Berenger's character emigrates to Canada.  It is there that he begins a relationship with a woman more closer to his age, portrayed by a young Helen Shaver.  Eventually they engage in a erotic strip scene before having sex together. But they end up breaking up also.  At the end of the film, Berenger is now a teacher, who sets up a date with a younger female student, and the film ends.  The eroticism is very good in this film, but it leaves you wanting more.  For me, Marilyn Lightstone, despite her little screen time, stole the spotlight with her eroticism and her sexy body.  Helen Shaver shows that she is willing to put out in a movie, also.  She would go on to even greater levels of eroticism in the movie ""Desert Hearts"".  Unfortunately, Tom Berenger never lived up to the potential to be a ""leading man"" actor that this film showed promise of when it was made.  Instead, he was confined to character roles, such as in the movie ""Gettysburg"".  But this film gives the viewer a glimpse of what Tom Berenger could have been had mainstream Hollywood had given him his chance to shine.",1106265600,48,2092,4.684931506849315
1920361,3,B0000D0YXY,"Oh, for a Time Machine. . .some metaphysical contraption to take me back to the Seventies, when I first saw and enjoyed this cute little movie.  Back in those heady days, I was able to lustily envy a young dude who embarks on a series of steamy affairs with attractive women almost twice his age, to gawk and gander while the muscular protagonist sweats and grunts and groans--then collapses exhausted into the nurturing arms of his mature lover.
But, time marches on, and so does my perception.  Almost thirty years after its theatrical release, I now watch IN PRAISE OF OLDER WOMEN and subsequently fidget and squirm with discomfort.  And that's not because the story is any less intriguing:  on the contrary, it's all the more alluring as I wax nostalgia from the distance of middle age. What bothers me--annoys me, actually--is the lack of production quality for this film:  from shabby lighting, to mumbling audio, to a musical score that literally makes you reach for the ""Mute"" button.
But there are other troubling problems.  Young Andras Vayda (Tom Berenger) is a young Hungarian with a wandering eye for the older ladies.  And Andras does find love (the rascal) in his turbulent, war-torn country--a country desperately trying to break free from Soviet domination.  Yet when Andras participates in the ill-fated Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the event is filmed in a sound stage the size of my living room (so much for scale).  Forced to flee Hungary, Andras takes his appetite to Montreal, and the trysts continue.
Some of the ""older women"" include Karen Black, Susan Strasberg, and Helen Shaver.  The ""mature scenes"" were certainly provocative in the Seventies, but are bland by today's standards.  Berenger furnishes sufficient ""abs of steel"" to satisfy female viewers, while the guys catch glimpses of female nudity through all the awful lighting.  As a comedy-drama, IN PRAISE OF OLDER WOMEN is passing entertainment, provided the viewer can look past all of its annoying defects.

1920362,3,B0000D0YXY,"This early Tom Berenger flick is actually quite enjoyable.  Playing a Hungarian stud obsessed with satisfying older women, Berenger is thoroughly convincing and charming.

1920383,1,B0000D0YXY,"I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Tom Berenger; when I was a teen 20+ years ago, I had a huge crush on him. He was a hunk in his day, I'll give him that. He was in his 20s here, I believe. However, this movie was a flop for me. I have no problem with the fact that it's all about sex. I expected something sensual and erotic; I expected Berenger to be exciting. Instead, I saw an awkward, clumsy, uncomfortable Berenger attempt to get it on with many women, and the dialogue and acting throughout were terrible. In addition, we see both the women's nudity and Tom's; he even flashes his kibbles and bits a couple of times moving around on the bed; again, it all seems awkward. This could've been so much better than it actually was; I know Berenger was playing someone a lot younger and a lot more inexperienced, but he had no passion or energy in this film at all. The sex scenes seemed as if everyone felt they had to force themselves to do it and try to enjoy it. By contrast, his sex fantasy scene with Daphne Zuniga in ""Last Rites"" was much more erotic. I don't recommend this film unless you want to see Berenger naked and having sex like a robot; that's all this film is about.",1404259200,2,1191,4.205240174672489
1920384,2,B0000D0YXY,It was a OK movie and moved to slow and was just the same thing over and over. Needed some action in it I guess. Different taste for different people. But I have to remember it was an old film!,1399507200,,193,3.85
1920385,4,B0000D0YXY,"""In Praise of Older Women"" had a momentous part to play in helping the Canadian film industry to get firmly on its own two feet. The novel on which it is based itself had been a strong seller and of real influence in the Dominion of Canada and abroad, too. So great so was the book's lasting appeal abroad that this led, in 1997 in Spain, to the appearance, from Lolafilms, of another zesty but less daring film, ""En brazos de la mujer madura"" (Studio Latino DVD-22142-1), which based itself more loosely upon the book, setting the action in Spain during, and just after, the Spanish Civil War, ending at an earlier point in the story, and that featured actor Juan Diego Botto as the pleasingly handsome and sexually adventurous young man (of whose naked flesh, alas, one beholds much less than one sees of Tom Berenger's in the earlier film). The Canadian movie itself may be rather neglected today, but it once was quite controversial and wildly successful (both by Canada's standards) and even helped in no small part to topple Ontario film censorship from its privileged but utterly prudish and barbaric position at the time (1978 was the year of release, the film dating 1977 in the end credits).

For sure, one thing that makes the Canadian film so wildly enjoyable to see is the acting, in and (especially!) out of clothes, of Tom Berenger, the American actor brought in to play the lead male role. His physical beauty and smouldering sensuality are utterly captivating. One fortunately gets to see, as already implied, a lot of his bare flesh in this film, though never quite full frontally nude, his male genitalia (beyond pubic hair) only very fleetingly glimpsed. The women in his life as serial lover (played by variously Canadian and American actresses) from a false start in his childhood, then from age sixteen onwards, are a variable lot, but most of them very ""easy on the eyes"" and act from acceptably to very proficiently.

Costing one million 1977 (Canadian) dollars to produce, the film was not a ""cheapie"" effort by any means, but it does somehow manage to look lower budget than really was the case. No matter; not to worry, for the film is highly enjoyable on its own terms and any faults can be chalked up to the Canadian film industry's relative immaturity at the time. The film, both Budapest and Montral scenes, was filmed alike on sets and on location in Montral.

The film is of more than merely historical interest. Get one of the DVD editions (of which this viewer has it widescreen as ThinkFilm TF-11605). It would have helped a bit to have subtitles available, for even for someone increasingly hard of hearing it nonetheless was possible to make out most (by far) of the English dialogue (and French spoken dialogue is an option). The featurette about the making of the film is rewardingly informative and detailed, a valuable ""extra"", indeed, for a DVD edition.",1395273600,,2897,4.755467196819086

1920387,4,B0000D0YXY,"Decent film for its time. Tom Berenger was young and it shows in his acting which was okay but not great. It was like a soft core porn show and was interesting.

1920393,4,B0000D0YXY,I enjoyed this film although it probably isn't for everyone's taste.  The psychology behind it and intellect of the characters is what interested me the most.

This is a ""guilty pleasure"" film and has been since we first saw it, we were in our mid-twenties when this film came out, and found pleasure in Tom Berenger then as now.  What a cutie!  However, now that I am an ""older woman"" I find even more pleasure in this film.  If only American men viewed older women as European men do.  In Praise of Older Women is racy and risque, now it would be rated at least an ""R"".  I'm sure the only reason it escaped being X Rated is that there are no genitalia visibily touching.  It leaves little to the imagination but is not vulgar.  Any of you older women out there that want a little thrill, try this one.  Mr. Berenger did not mind showing off his physic and strutting his stuff throughout much of the film.  He had a ""six pack"" before we even knew what they were!
