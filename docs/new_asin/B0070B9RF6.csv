I am loving the entire series, and these are new and sealed, so I am sure they will be great. I am having to order the ones netflix does not have, which is the reason I bought this collection.",1381190400,2,350,4.161764705882353

5046233,5,B0070B9RF6,"Impeccable condition, fast shipping, and packaged perfectly. I have been watching this series online- I love it!- but some of the collections are not available. Amazon.com to the rescue! In this collection,  Barnabas is still out to find a way to save 'the future'. We have new characters in Aristede and Count Petofi and new drama around every corner! Can't get enough Dark Shadows!",1372291200,,383,4.984375
5046234,5,B0070B9RF6,I have been watching these shows (in order) for quite a while and I'm amazed at the new plot twists and strange characters that keep turning up!  This collection (so far -- I haven't finished it yet) is no exception!  The poor beleagered Collins family has another problem to contend with.  I won't give away any spoilers...  I was fascinated with this show as a young girl and now enjoy it even more!,1365552000,,401,4.4520547945205475

5046250,4,B0070B9RF6,"Storyline getting real interesting here and its great to see some new characters thrown in the mix, rather than having the same actors play multiple roles. hope collection 16 is just as interesting.",1405382400,,198,5.03030303030303
5046251,5,B0070B9RF6,"The plot thickens as Barnabas continues his journey in 1897. I forgot how entertaining and addictive these episodes were. It's much better the 2nd time around. This review will contain spoilers! Quentin Collins is still trying to rid himself of the Werewolf curse. Magda has stolen the dark magical hand of the evil Count Petofi that she hopes will help, but the hand has its own agenda. Soon, Petofi himself shows up, looking for the hand, along with his sidekick, Aristede. There is a great episode involving a pendulum trap, similar to 'Saw V' Meanwhile, Rev. Gregory Trask plots to run Collinwood, by marrying Judith and making her think she's crazy. (After re-watching these episodes, I have a newfound love for 1897 Rev. Trask because he's really sinister and corrupt.) If you love this gothic soap opera, I'm sure you'll love DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION 15",1402704000,,859,4.931034482758621

5046254,4,B0070B9RF6,"This was a 4 DVD set that Netflix doesn't have of the original TV series. Having watched the entire series up to that point, I was forced to purchase it to resolve the cliffhanger from with Collection 14 left me.",1399766400,,212,4.325
5046255,5,B0070B9RF6,"As a teenager, I was hooked on the Dark Shadows series. I would run up the driveway and drop in front of the TV every day to watch Barnabus Collins and the rest of the Dark Shadows characters live through the trials and tribulations of life in Collinwood. Then I would call my friend Debbie and we would rehash every scene! I bought one season so that I could show my kids and my oldest daughter is now hooked! For every occasion (birthday, Christmas, great report card, 5-Mondays in a month, etc.) she begs for a new collection. I protest (a little) and then get them for her because I am enjoying the sheer pleasure she is getting from them. It's like taking a step back in time...",1388620800,,683,4.34375
