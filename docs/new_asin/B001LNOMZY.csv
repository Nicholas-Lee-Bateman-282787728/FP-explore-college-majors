8319132,3,B001LNOMZY,Not exactly what I expected and I have not watched the movie all the way through yet.,1519171200,,85,4.0588235294117645
8319133,5,B001LNOMZY,"A treasure and worth the B+ quality film itself. Good dialogue, great characters, good plot and back story. Just fun. Not a great classic, but a solid old-time British mystery - good contrast to US mysteries of the time. Don't miss Ebenezer Scrooge in a very early role!",1497139200,,270,4.645833333333333
8319134,4,B001LNOMZY,I have not watched this movie yet but nearly all  old movies are good.  I have ordered several old ones because i choose these over newer ones.,1487980800,,143,4.2592592592592595

8319136,4,B001LNOMZY,"WHat an amazing romance; in a little more than a day or two the detective falls for the girl and they are to get married at end.  AHHH, love at first sight.  The mystery is better then average.  So if you like the old British mysteries you will enjoy this one.",1449100800,,260,4.0588235294117645
8319137,5,B001LNOMZY,"Very good movie of the for the age it was made in. Quite entertaining; and even having some melodramatic suspense. Great showing for the viewers that the police of England can solve a murder without Scotland Yard. Good Show, with good acting and story line. A plot that has been copied many times since.",1433116800,,303,4.62962962962963
8319138,1,B001LNOMZY,I was looking forward to watching this movie.  The sound is very bad.  I couldn't watch it.,1421193600,2,91,4.294117647058823
8319139,2,B001LNOMZY,I bought this film hoping for an 'oldie but goodie'. I was disapointed. It's certainly old. But is very far from being good. With a poor picture poorly packaged and of all round low quality. I gave my dvd to a local charity shop.,1356825600,4,229,4.2272727272727275
8319140,5,B001LNOMZY,"I throughly enjoyed this movie, well paced, good characters and writing.  It's not great, it's good and I'm glad I bought it.",1297728000,10,125,4.681818181818182
