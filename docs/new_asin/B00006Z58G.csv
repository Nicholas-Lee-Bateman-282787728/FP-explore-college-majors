Even though I like mr. Penland and have met with him in the past.  But this kata explanation is very poor.",1328832000,,175,4.303030303030303
7973426,3,B00006Z58G,"The material in the video is very well presented, and Mr. Penland explains the movements and techniques very thouroughly and clearly.  The form is repeated over and over from multiple angles, and the way the video was produced makes it very easy to learn the movements of the form.  However, I am personally not impressed with the material presented, and don't believe that all the fuss over the years about the Matsumura Hakutsuru was worth it.",1191628800,2,445,4.842105263157895
7973427,5,B00006Z58G,Outstanding is too calm a word to describe how I feel about this video. I have always been fascinated by this extremely rare & Secret style of Karate. The instructor is great at teaching you the proper forms and gives you a lot of insight into this hidden treasure. Great for the serious martial art.,1091750400,,300,4.472727272727273
