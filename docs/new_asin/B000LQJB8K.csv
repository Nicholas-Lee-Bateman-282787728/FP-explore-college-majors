What a disappointment. It wasn't terrible, but it's not something I'd watch again. The 'suprise' ending was hardly a suprise.

I give it 2 stars.

2712889,5,B000LQJB8K,"The House On Skull Mountain  (1974)  **

A dying woman lies in her bed in a large mansion as a Priest reads her ""the last rites."" She asks her servant to bring her ""the letters"" and then gives them to the Priest requesting that he send them out. After the Priest leaves her room with the servant, she opens a wooden box and takes out what appears to be a ""voodoo doll"" and then she dies! The ""letters"" are invitations to her last surviving family members to come to the house. This opening scene hints at better things to come, however, much of what proceeds is rather disappointing.

The plot involves the classic gathering-of-the-relatives to read-the-will which became standard in many horror/suspense films. A nice element to the story and with a blend in voodoo and blaxploitation themes, and even hints at an inter-racial romance, ""The House On Skull Mountain"" is unique in its various themes. However, none of these elements really work out and the film comes off as being a hodgepodge. Mike Evans' (Lionel on the Jeffersons) role as a ""playboy type"" character comes off more as annoying than actually being entertaining or being the ""comic relief"" of the picture, which is how I saw his character trying to be. Sorely miscast is Victor French (Mr. Edwards on ""Little House On The Prairie) as a ""white"" descendent of the black heiress. His ""almost"" romance with lovely Janee Michele comes off as more of a ""friendship"" than anything resembling a possible ""romance."" There's even a ""love song"" sequence in the film and while it's playing we see Victor and Janee spending their day together in town visiting shops and holding hands. This scene is completely out of place in a movie that is supposed to be a ""horror"" film!

There are also some ""did you see that!"" things that occur in the film, too. One of them is during the old lady's funeral as you see two ""white"" grave digger guys standing with shovels a few feet from the grave while the Priest is reading his prayers. Then after a spooky occurrence happens and one of the servants says- ""Cover her up!"" 2 ""black"" guys start shoveling the dirt onto the casket! And your thinking- ""I thought those 2 grave digger guys were ""white?"" Whoever directed this scene was either drunk, color blind, or both! I enjoyed the ending of the picture the most with the servant using voodoo to summon the dead! The film has a made-for-TV look about it due to the fact that there are really only about 10 or so people in the cast and not much in the way of special effects. ""The House On Skull Mountain"" is not by no means a ""classic"" in the way of ""The Haunting"" or many of the gothic"" Hammer Horror"" films are, and even with it's flaws and hokey plot it's still an enjoyable watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

The DVD's picture quality is excellent and the audio superb! The movie is on its own disc with a cool full color picture illustration of the movie's theatrical poster on it.

The Mephisto Waltz  (1971)  *****

Stylish and intriguing, ""The Mephisto Waltz"" is a theatrical entry in the satanic genre which the late 1960's and early 1970's were chock full of and it's sad that we do not see such films today.  Alan Alda (TV's M*A*S*H) plays Myles Clarkson, a classical music reviewer, who is granted a rare review by piano genius,  Duncan Eli (brilliantly played by Curt Jurgens) who after meeting Myles, and examining his hands, decides he has found the perfect specimen for a devious occult experiment!  Unknown to Myles, and his gorgeous wife, Paula (Jacqueline Bisset) the guy is a Satanist, who arranges to have their souls switch places at his death, so that he can be young again and continue to play piano (thus needing a skilled piano player like Alda to switch bodies with) and forever be with his young lover, Roxanne (beautiful Barbara Parkins).

""The Mephisto Waltz"" is incredibly entertaining and contains several elements of intrigue and has an incredible ""twist"" ending!  One of the most chilling scenes in the movie is when Paula decides to win Myles back, even if it means summoning the devil!! Paula uses a magic book and draws the infamous pagan sign of ""the pentagram"" on the floor and summons the devil to ""make a deal!"" And it isn't TV's ""Let's Make A Deal's"" Monte Hall that shows up, but old Slew foot himself!  You hear footsteps coming down the hall and Paula's on the floor looking up as the door slowly opens...the look on Paula's face as she looks up to greet her visitor is nothing short of chilling!!  In the same league as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Stepford Wives,"" and practically any of the `70's horror made-for-TV movies, ""The Mephisto Waltz"" is an enjoyable watch and one that you will want to see again!

The DVD's picture quality is excellent and the audio superb! The movie is on its own disc with a cool full color picture illustration of the movie's theatrical poster on it. I wish ALL of the MGM Midnite Movies were released like this, instead of the ""two sided flip over"" discs!",1208390400,35,4975,4.634090909090909

Mephisto Waltz is an absolute gem of a horror movie -- one which has been unavailable for far too long. It's wonderful that Fox finally released it on DVD.

It's companion piece on this two-DVD set is hardly worth watching. It's like some weird merging of ""The Old Dark House"" and ""Foxy Brown"" (or maybe ""Blackula""). I have a real appetite for cheesy horror flix, and even I came away from ""Skull"" feeling like I'd just wasted a couple hours of my life.

So, I highly recommend this set; but if you buy it, recognize that what you're getting is one DVD and one plastic disk you can use for a drink coaster.",1194480000,26,646,4.366666666666666
2712892,3,B000LQJB8K,"This is an unusual double feature offering as the two films seemingly have little to do with one another. House on Skull Mountain almost feels like a Blaxploitation film as 99% of the cast is African American and the formal theme is about lineage and heritage. There's an interesting inversion here that we in the postmodern age would find interesting. The storyline of four heirs are summoned to a Caribbean island for the reading of a will, and find themselves at the will of a Voodoo practitioner (I don't want to give anything away). Its a serviceable film, and frankly, had the cast been all Euro/white/caucasian, wouldn't not have been as interesting. Now, this contrasts with Mephisto Waltz as European high society is depicted as without morals and succumbing to their own desire and deepest intstictual drives. I will say no more about this, except that its a pity no one reads Freud anymore. It's a plain mystery why Alan Alda got to be a household word.",1193788800,3,964,4.778443113772455
2712893,5,B000LQJB8K,"... is also the title of the purportedly most difficult piece every written for piano, by Franz Liszt. You get to hear parts of that piece quite a bit in this horror film. The aging grandest piano player alive, Duncan Eli (played magnificently by German master actor Curd Juergens), is quite obsessed with this piano solo. While giving a young music journalist Myles Clarkson (Alan Alda) an interview, he recognizes Myles' large hands, and starts to invite him and his beautiful wife (Jacqueline Bisset) into his circle of friends. Of course, he has ulterior motives to do that ...

It is amazing how this film from 1971 can still conjure up a good deal of chills. A demonic soundtrack and moody camera settings together with great acting are all that it takes. No gore is required, and when in one of the most dramatic scenes the devil himself appears, actually showing him would only have detracted from the suspense already built up, and no image of him would have been able to scare you more than the look on the face of Bisset summoning the Master.

Great acting from Juergens, two even in today's world stunning actresses (Bisset and Barbara Parkins as Duncan's daughter and then some), fantastic music and soundtrack, a great story with a few unexpected twists: a classic but still relevant after all these years!",1193529600,58,1320,4.785087719298246

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is a 1971 American occult horror film, was directed by Paul Wendkos and starred Alan Alda and the incredible Jacqueline Bisset as the films main couple, Myles Clarkson and Paula Clarkson. The title THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is taken from the piano work by Franz Liszt entitled Mephisto Waltzes and is based on the novel by Fred Mustard Stewart, and the film follows in deadpan style the antics of a deranged concert pianist Duncan Ely [Curt Jurgens], dying of leukaemia whose lust for his daughter Roxanne [Barbara Parkins] and devotion to devil-worship and are out to destroy the marriage of writer Alan Alda and Jacqueline Bisset.

Another star of THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is the music itself, particularly if you like classical piano a la Liszt and Mozart. The top-notch classical piano played throughout the film certainly adds a nice rich dimension to the film. There are very few horror films which have this kind of focus on music; in fact, I can think of no others. If you like beautiful women and beautiful music and the witty banter of Alan Alda to boot, then this might even be the perfect spooky creepy film for you.

The film centres around Myles Clarkson, a frustrated pianist and music journalist, and his ravishing wife Paula Clarkson, and their creepily growing involvement with another couple, Duncan Ely who in the film is one of the greatest piano virtuosos and their attractive daughter Roxanne. Paula Clarkson in particular is not down with the weird level of attention they are suddenly receiving from this couple, but Myles Clarkson is honoured to be considered a new friend by the well-known Duncan Ely but unbeknownst to Myles Clarkson and Paula Clarkson, Duncan Ely and Roxanne are Satanists, and with Duncan Elys impending death from leukaemia, the father and daughter perform a ritual which transfers Duncan Elys soul into Myles Clarksons body and despite it might seem like I just gave the films plot away, there is I can assure you there is much more to it that that.

However, film genres of this spooky kind in the 1970s were more defiantly offbeat than THE MEPHISTO WALTZ. The only film produced by Twentieth Century Fox during 1970 due to financial reasons, THE MEPHISTO WALTZ was based upon a novel of the same name by Fred Mustard Stewart and was directed by the late Paul Wendkos, who was a fairly prolific director who spent the majority of his career operating within the field of American television. With its tale of the occult conspiracies, Satanic rituals and soul transference, THE MEPHISTO WALTZ was unfortunately greeted with a rather lukewarm critical reaction and subsequently  met with limited box-office success, despite featuring a cast headlined by Alan Alda and Jacqueline Bisset. THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is largely viewed as little more than an odd, early major studio featuring devil worship and possession of the seventies.

The real chills with the film THE MEPHISTO WALTZ has to offer however, are surprisingly hidden away on a slightly deeper, and on a much more character based level. Indeed, if the viewer takes the time to dig beneath the surface there is something about the relationship between Duncan Ely and his daughter Roxanne which really does make the flesh creep, not only in terms of their barely concealed incest, but also in terms of the way in which they icily go about treating the personalities, relationships and lives of innocents as a disposable commodity to be used either for personal gratification or as some sort of Satanic bargaining tool. Accentuated by the aforementioned good performances of Alan Alda, Barbara Parkins and Curt Jurgens, there is really something genuinely creepy about that and this is enough to make THE MEPHISTO WALTZ an ultimately rewarding creepy spooky chiller for the more contemplative viewer.

In fairness however, Paul Wendkos does pull off one genuinely startling visual coup early on in the film when, during a typically decadent New Years Eve party thrown by the Ely's, Roxanne is seen petting a rather large and ferocious dog which is donning a mask of a human head. This curiously malignant and unsettling visual of a lifeless human head on a canine body would feature prominently upon both the films theatrical poster and in publicity stills used to promote the films original release. Meanwhile THE MEPHISTO WALTZ also benefits from the presence of the totally brilliant composer Jerry Goldsmith's very atmospheric fine score, the intentionally jarring and alarming discord at the same time of which has a tangible diabolic edge to it, making it an evocative and befitting accompaniment to the films Satanic themes.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Signal One Entertainment brings us this Blu-ray in a very pleasant 1080p encode image. It doesn't look particularly dynamic but I'll wager it's a strong replication of the film's original appearance. Generally, the visuals are consistently thick with texture, colours have a bit of richness and detail modest. It is in ots original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and looks solid in-motion. There are some light frame-specific scratches and few speckles but nothing impinging the HD presentation. This probably can't look much tighter than by comparing to the upcoming Kino Lorber Blu-ray release, which I anticipate will be very similar, if not near exact in terms of quality.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Signal One Entertainment brings us this Blu-ray with a choice of two audio presentations, which are 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo, which of course the second one is for the audio commentary. Effects exist but the biggest attribute of the sound is the film music score by the late and great Jerry Goldsmith, which has a very brooding quality and sounding crisp in the uncompressed audio presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

1080p High Definition Transfer

Audio Commentary by DVD Deliriums Nathaniel Thompson and Tim Greer: Here we get introduced by Nathaniel Thompson and Tim Greer, where unfortunately the sound is far too loud. They both praise the all-time great and prolific film composer Jerry Goldsmith, and we are informed that this was Jerry Goldsmiths first horror film. When we get to the scene at the masked party and you see the nasty black dog being led around the guest with a mask on, well if you look carefully it is a mask of the actor William Shatner. But overall you get lots of details about the film and how previously when the film was viewed on American Television it was heavily censored because of all the profanity, whereas you are viewing the full version of the film. Also I only dipped in briefly with each chapter, as I could not stand watching the film again, because again I found the whole film very boring and not at all a good horror film, as again it was presented like a typical American TV film.

Special Feature: Dancing With The Devil [2017] [1080p] [1.85:1] [18:52] This is a brand new in-depth audio/visual essay by Scottish Michael Mackenzie, who works as a Canadian film director, screenwriter, theatre director, playwright and dramaturge. Michael Mackenzie has directed two feature films, both theatrically released in Canada. His plays have been staged in Europe and North America and variously published in English, French, German and Hungarian. He praises the director Paul Wendkos, who originally did the long running famous American TV Series The Untouchables [1961-1963] and The Fugitive [1963-1967] and unfortunately makes this film in the style of those TV series, but Michael Mackenzie gives great praise to the brilliant composer Jerry Goldsmith who helped to give the film some spooky atmosphere. Throughout the commentary, Michael Mackenzie is so much better in describing a film he really loves, especially now it has been brought out on the Blu-ray disc, than what I feel about this very dull and second rate film.

Special Feature: Promotional Materials Gallery [2017] [1080p] [1.78:1] Here we get to view 22 promotional colour and black-and-white images relating to the film. To view all of the images you have to press the right next button on your remote control.

Original Theatrical Trailer [1971] [480i] [1.37:1] [2:26] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE MEPHISTO WALTZ. Unfortunately the quality of the print is atrocious, but a great spooky presentation.

Finally, so in conclusion, whilst the film is rather drawn out and definitely over the top for its own good, but by and large THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is to my mind just a very standard slightly spooky creepy film genre presentation, and definitely an over the top convoluted tale of devil worship and soul transference. On the whole those desiring a more traditional or overt horror picture are probably best advised to steer clear of this film altogether, but for those willing to accept the film of Paul Wendkos on its own terms, I personally feel in particular, it has some rather glaring boring shortcoming's, that is why personally I feel it should be a forgotten classic, and THE MEPHISTO WALTZ is for all to see is just like a standard run of the mill American TV episode of the most boring kind!

Although that may be true, this is still an eerie, interesting film.  By the way, Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins are just gorgeous.  The 4 stars are for the quality of the Bluray.  Unfortunately for the Bluray, one of the attempts to make this movie stylish involves lighting, filters and fairly tight close-ups.  The normal scenes in the movie aren't bad for a 1971 film in a Bluray edition; however, those stylish closeups come off much too soft and milky.  The sound is ok, but we have to remember that there is only so much you can do with the original source materials.

2712906,4,B000LQJB8K,"John Williams, when asked if he could have written a score that someone else had written, cited ""The Mephisto Waltz"". It seems that Williams could hear Jerry Goldsmith writing the score on piano in the next bungalow and fell it love with the music. The music is only one highlight of this thriller. You'll figure out the ending far before the main characters do.

I first saw this on CBS in a pan and scanned version for a midnight movie presentation. As a kid, I found it fascinating and still enjoy it years later although not quite to the same degree as I did before.

Alan Alda plays an Myles Clarkson a Julliard trained pianist working as a journalist. After being befriended by the brilliant piano player Duncan Ely (Curt Jergens), Ely takes Clarkson under his wing to help the young man's career. That friendship with Myles makes Clarkson's wife Paula (Jacqueline Bisset) suspicious. Things begin to take an even stranger turn when Duncan dies.

Directed by Paul Wendkos who was best known for TV movies and TV series (although he also directed the movies ""Gidget"", ""Guns of The Magnificent Seven"") such as ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" and episodes of ""The Invaders"", the film holds up well as a horror thriller. Based on the novel by  Fred Mustard Stewart (""The Norlis Tapes"") the production features sterling performances all around.

The Blu- ray looks a bit faded and the deliberate use of filters to soften the close ups and give the film a glossy look, contributes to a soft look for the film. It would be impossible to improve the detail on the film--it is what it is and this is due to how the film was shot. The depth is an improvement over the DVD I've seen and colors, although not robust, look pretty good. This looks fairly typical for an early 70's film. The film appears in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1. The bit rate is pretty good here as well even though this is on a single layer Blu-ray.

Although audio doesn't have the depth of a modern recording, the mono presentation sounds pretty good highlighting the terrific score by Goldsmith. Dialog remains clear throughout and we get subtitles in English.

The Blu-ray comes with two special features that are quite nice. There are two commentary tracks by  actress Pamelyn Ferdin moderated by Elijah Drenner and one by film historian Bill Cooke. Cooke's commentary is filled with both trivia about the production and other films of the time that influenced it (and the novel). It's obviously scripted but that also means there's no dead air. Curiously, Cooke misidentifies director Phil Kaufman as Paul Kaufman when discussing one section of the party scene and its possible influence on Kaufman's ""Invasion of The Body Snatchers"" (1979).  We also get trailers for the film, ""Burnt Offerings"", ""Deranged"", ""Jennifer"" all Kino releases. It's unfortunate that Kino didn't license the twenty minute featurette from the UK release but what we have here is quite good.

Although not quite in the category of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Omen"", it does compare favorably to films like ""The Other"".",1492214400,2,3075,4.84

Kid wakes up with fever
Kid has convulsion
Kid gets taken to hospital
Doc walks out and tells them she is fine and strong and working to figure out what is wrong.
Morning comes and Doc walks into waiting room, where they have been all night, and announces in a very nonchalant way, ""We tried everything and couldn't save her. Shes gone""
Both Alda and Bisset react to the news by holding their head down a bit and sighing then Bisset runs down some stairs only to be babbling something like "" I knew something was going on. 1st Ely now Abby""
The next scene moves on with the story and nothing mentioned of the child again. No mourning, no funeral no nothing. I'v never seen a movie, even a horror movie, treat a child's death in a movie so unimportant and blas! Very laughable...",1408492800,,1099,4.339805825242719

2712942,2,B000LQJB8K,"Wow, where do I start?  The only redeeming feature of the Mephisto Waltz? Jacqueline Bissette!  It's always a win-win situation looking at that lady. Wowzers...

The plot is not clever at all and really a rehash of Star Trek episodes with people changing bodies and throw in an occult angle to it and voila.

What is so hilarious is how everyone acts like Alan Alda is the sexiest thing, couldn't figure that one out?  The rituals didn't seem authentic to a satanic cult, the psychodelic stuff got tiresome, and ultimately the ending was possibly THE worst ending in history....WARNING SPOILER AHEAD...why in the heck would Jacqueline Bissett's character want to:

a) change bodies with Barbara Parkins' character, Roxanne? That's like jumping from a Porsche to a Camry

b) why would someone who has had these satanists kill her own precious daughter and slay her husband want to make a deal with the devil herself and play ball with the diabolical? Fighting evil with evil and giving in?

c) inhabite the body of Roxanne and then end up with the husband body you started out with (again, Alan Alda, ????) only this time the soul/personality of that far-from-handsome body is a diabolical and evil murdering musician?  How superficial and weak can we get here?

The story wasn't scary at all, seemed very cheesy, and was predictable except for the insane ending...didn't see that stupid plot coming!  The atmosphere wasn't as scary as some devilish flicks. There was no sense of forboding or doom. It was bland.  Again, the rituals seemed unrealistic and not authentic and I asked myself, ""why in the heck did I buy this movie?""  Ebay time! I'm unloading this stinker!

I must re-emphasize: only redeeming factor: Jacqueline Bissette!",1247961600,,1734,4.93448275862069
2712943,3,B000LQJB8K,"The House on Skull Mountain (Ron Honthaner, 1974)

Silly blaxploitation effort that's actually not half bad, as long as you're willing to ignore the fact that most of the aspects of this movie were done better in other flicks.

Plot: an old voodoo woman who lives in a mansion outside Atlanta (as you may surmise, the mansion is, in fact, on Skull Mountain) dies, and her descendants are gathered together for the reading of the will. Her descendants are something of a mixed lot (of just about every stereotype you'd expect to find in a low-rent blaxploitation flick, including the mysterious white descendant, played by Victor French), and when they go to visit the grave soon after all have arrived, weird things occur, and there's a drug-induced vision--or is it reality? Watch on and find out...

Things get a lot weirder from there, including a cult of mind-controlled thugs, a handful of folks who may or may not be zombies, a lot of voodoo, and perhaps most distressingly, a love-story subplot between French and female lead Janee Michelle (who, despite the differences in skin color, are supposed to be close relatives).

It's definitely odd, and derivative as all get-out, but with the exception of one all-too-long scene that takes repetition in film to heights rarely seen outside the world of structural filmmaking, it's watchable in that cheesy sort of way. Honthaner, who spent most of his Hollywood career as an editor, never directed another film, so I can't be certain when I say the movie was meant to be cheesy, but I certainly get that impression from it. If I look at it with that eye, then it succeeds. Don't expect greatness and you should have fun with this one. **

The Mephisto Waltz (Paul Wendkos, 1971)

1970 was a pretty bad year for Twentieth Century Fox, thanks to a number of rather spectacular box-office failures in 1969; in fact, times were so tight they produced only a single film during the entire calendar year of 1970. You'd expect in such circumstances they'd have tried to go with something that would really be a blockbuster for them, wouldn't you? Instead, they decided to greenlight The Mephisto Waltz, which, despite having an incredible cast, manages to be memorable only because Alan Alda gets to make out with both Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins, two of the most beautiful women in cinema at the time.

Based on a potboiler by Fred Mustard Stewart, The Mephisto Waltz tells the story of journalist Myles Clarkson (Alda), a former piano prodigy who gave it up after his first recital got mediocre reviews. He gets a chance to interview the famed, eccentric pianist Duncan Ely (The Spy Who Loved Me's Curd Jurgens), and the two of them hit it off, with the result that Clarkson gets invited into Ely's inner circle of eccentrics. While Clarkson's wife Paula (Bisset) is initially thrilled, she soon realizes that the bunch of them are as dangerous as they are weird. As well, it seems Roxanne (Peyton Place's Barbara Parkins), the high priestess of Duncan's bizarre cult, has romantic designs on Myles. She's partly right, but sex is only the tip of the iceberg where these folks are concerned...

I described the novel as a potboiler, and the movie follows suit very well. This is typical of the genre in every way, featuring a number of utterly predictable plot twists, some gratuitous nudity and violence, needless psychedelia, and a title sequence that's straight out of late-sixties television. Not an awful way to kill some time when you've got a very slow night ahead of you, but not at all what you'd expect from one of Hollywood's biggest studios' only film in an entire year. **",1243814400,5,3651,4.8086124401913874
2712944,2,B000LQJB8K,"A pair of long-limbed occult movies here, neither particularly memorable (thus a disc I've already sold). HOUSE is a blaxploitation voodoo yarn with a white hero (Victor French, of all people). Essentially an Old Dark House-style mystery with estranged relatives (three black, one white) brought together for the reading of their great-grandmother's will, but the maid and butler, who practise voodoo, have other plans for the money. Good concept, but the production is strictly TV movie level, hardly surprising considering the cast, almost all of whom were small screen thesps at best. French was a TV mainstay who would soon go on to LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, while Mike Evans, the other most recognizable face in the cast, had a few telemovies to his name, but would shortly start an extended run as Lionel on the classic sitcoms ALL IN THE FAMILY and THE JEFFERSONS.

Much better, but still severely dated, is THE MEPHISTO WALTZ, one of the few theatrical features of TV vet Paul Wendkos, and it looks like a TV movie, too, only with more boobs, gore and swearing, as music journalist Alan Alda get possessed by the spirit of newly-departed concert pianist and satanist Curt Jurgens. Jackie Bissett is Alda's wife, who becomes hip to the ruse after Alda takes over the dead man's career and their daughter dies of an unexplained illness. Some creepy moments and an intriguingly dark twist, but the oh-so-typically Hollywood-liberal portrayal of the outwardly conservative tuxedo classes as society's truly debauched sin-seeking swingers was pretty worn out even by 1971, when this was made.",1241308800,3,1598,5.076045627376426
