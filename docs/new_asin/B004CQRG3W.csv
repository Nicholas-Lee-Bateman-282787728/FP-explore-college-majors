8423409,5,B004CQRG3W,"If you like to see uninhibited creative wheels then this is it.  It would be easy to say each of these vehicles owners are mental.  But that would be giving them, and their visions, the short shrift.  In some way this is why we've got to where we are...no shame and crazed creativity.  The one commonality is the joy in which all these ""creators"" share in their personal inner drives.  Fortunately for us it can make us chuckle and even stand up and salute.  You gotta love people who share their insanity in a way that entertains.",1528502400,,531,4.422680412371134
8423410,4,B004CQRG3W,There are alot of cars in it but it is WAY more about people than cars. Pretty cool documentary.,1518220800,,96,4.105263157894737
8423411,5,B004CQRG3W,"I'm not even into cars, and I love this film! Imagination meets reality and blows peoples minds! Imagine walking down the street and seeing a giant black Cathedral driving by with stained glass windows! Or seeing a Telephone driving down the street or a van covered in cameras- made to look like the lens of a camera! Its a delight to hear the stories behind these moving works of art, and also witness peoples reaction to them. Harrod Blank is a truly talented film maker- AND artist !(Maker of the ""Camera Van"" and ""Oh My God!"" car). This movie moves quickly and will even keep small children entertained for the whole film! That is a feat in itself! Everyone of all ages will enjoy this film! I did!",1514678400,,702,4.4921875

8423413,4,B004CQRG3W,I am planning on creating an art car and this served to confirm a lot of my thoughts on why. I wish there was one that was a bit more technical on how to do it.,1434240000,,160,3.4722222222222223
8423414,5,B004CQRG3W,"DVD/Automorphosis. Even if you detest cars and trucks and rue the day horses were not allowed on the streets anymore, buy this DVD. Give it to your grandmother for Christmas. It's the most amazing, fast moving piece of moving art you will ever see. As a retired nurse nearing 70, I fell in love with this look at the creativity of people who like to decorate something other than a tree. How tired I get of the various colored lumps that pass for cars now, I don't care what kind they are, they all look like lumps except for the square lumps. The most darling thing people do is to put bumper stickers on their cars about something dumb that is on almost every car. I purchases ""car lashes"" and ""car lash liner"" and a set of lips for my little gray lump and it's fun to see the unsuspecting people walk by and do a second take and maybe get the only grin they'll get all day long. It's even more fun when I forget they're on there and wonder what people are staring at and laughing about. There is barely a way to describe the artistry that various people have gone to, to decorate their automobiles, they are moving works of art. Some have one theme such as salt and pepper shakers, others have a variety of things stuck on every square inch of their car or van or truck. This is such a fun documentary that is made for people of all ages, so you can sit with your small children and watch it. They will love it. I wished all of the people whose vehicles show up in this documentary lived in my town. Plus, if you think about it, things glued onto your car cover a million sins. Just buy this right now and make someone's BD or an otherwise drab get together memorable. Look back, what did you do for your 8th BD? Without photos you have no clue, but if you buy Automorphosis, you'll remember you saw it on your 8th BD, or you 80th BD.",1344124800,2,1837,4.206798866855524
8423415,5,B004CQRG3W,"Very glad to see that this wonderful indie film has made it to Amazon. Although you can watch it just for the fantastic art cars, the real stars of the film are the vivid people who created them. It's a funny, fast-paced parade of character studies -- and there are some truly colorful characters here! Each of these little vignettes leaves you wishing you could linger with that person for a few minutes more. And while you're smiling, you're also getting a bit of perspective on society's unwritten rules and pressures to conform. This film works well on several levels, and it's hard to imagine anyone of any age not liking it. (In fact, I plan to keep a few DVDs on hand for when I need a gift for someone who's hard to shop for.) Fun, insightful, and highly recommended!",1290816000,,775,4.50354609929078
