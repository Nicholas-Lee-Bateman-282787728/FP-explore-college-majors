2409855,4,B000BB1516,"Wanting to watch a show you enjoyed during childhood as an adult can often lead to great disappointment (try watching the evening news. It's not the same, is it.), so my wife and I came into the Tomorrow People with low expectations. A lot of the acting is weak, many scenes have obvious fluffed dialog, the effects are very British (Dr. Who), and the stories seem to have an overly simplified conclusion. Despite all of this it has been enjoyable, and for us has faired better than other shows we've tried to watch. Some of the stories were fairly complex for a kids show (far more so than any US shows), especially in later seasons when the stories get heavier and darker.

I don't know how one would feel watching this for the first time, but then again I don't know why someone would seek this out except from a nostalgic stand point.

Expect nothing and you'll never be disappointed.",1212624000,4,888,4.54375
2409856,4,B000BB1516,"The good was very good. Some of the scripts were superb, some of the acting was brilliant, some of the ideas were ingenious. The special effects were poor, but understandable - their budget was something close to a hundredth of that of Doctor Who at the time, and Doctor Who couldn't afford much either. Some of the actors hammed it up, and Mr. Price was guilty of adding more than a little camp - he wanted to be writing comedy as well, but wasn't allowed to, so mixed the two. The result was... not good.

So what can I say? The good stories have terrible moments, and the poor stories have superb moments. If you want polished, this isn't it. But if you're looking for raw, on-the-edge sci-fi that explores what it is to be human - this is brilliant and is without equal, warts and all.

Yes, but who are these ""Tomorrow People"" and what are the stories on the DVD? It's hard to answer the first without providing some sort of spoiler. Suffice to say, they are the main characters in the story. The stories themselves are mostly quests, though there are some escape stories and a few that defy any standard label. Enough is spelled out that the viewer does not need to put in much thought, but it is intellectual in its own way. Don't expect top-class High Speculative Fiction. This is somewhere between Science Fiction and Science Fantasy, and is most definitely ""mid-range"" in terms of intelligence vs. action.

Who would this be good for? Definitely old-time sf fans, anyone who likes highly unusual television and anyone who likes sf but doesn't like High Adventure. I would also say budding script writers and students in media arts would find it valuable, as it contains many experimental concepts.",1181520000,2,1707,4.645695364238411
2409857,4,B000BB1516,"This series from the 70s is about a group of young people who discover they are the next phase of human evolution.  They are naturally telepathic, telekinetic and can teleport (jaunte).  They are also in possession of an alien supercomputer ""TIM"" explicitly capable of original thought and a hideout with advanced technology. uThey also have the handicap of not being able to kill even in self defense.  Despite this, they have numerous adventures with human and alien bad guys and have become the acknowledged (by the ""Galactic Federation"") autority of Earth though almost no one knows about them.

 I found the series enjoyable but a little campy.  There is also a couple of points where the characters take actions which arguably are inconsistant with a prohibition on killing (like sabotaging a spacehip).",1178409600,,809,5.090909090909091
2409858,5,B000BB1516,"I love the Tomorrow People. I watched this show in the early 1980's on the new ""Nick"". channel. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I never met many people who had seen it before. You can actually buy the whole series from Amazon UK and the disks are code 0, so they will play here. I really remembered the later episodes with Mike Bell (certainly the episodes when Hitler came back to life and the unfortunate fate of Pavla the Russian TP. My favorie episode has to be the ""Heart of Soggoth"". Mike falls under the spell of an evil drum. You can't beat that!
These shows were campy, yet wonderful in the fact that they did not treat children like idiots who only liked to see people covered in green slime (I always hated those Nick shows). Oh, who can forget the epsiodes with the ""Bubble skin Jump Suits""?
I believe most of the episodes I discussed come later, but the Tomorrow People certainly is quite unique. I always wanted to live in the lab! I never liked the new lab much, though. This show is so worth it. My [...] niece loves it!",1151539200,5,1051,4.313131313131313

8084184,5,B000BB1516,"If you didn't grow up with this show, you're probably not going to like this - it's a campy/cheezy British Sci-Fi show from the mid-late 1970s.

However, if you grew up watching them as I did, then this is a serious trip down nostalgia lane.

I seem to recall there being more episodes than this, but apparently, the episodes being spread out one 30-minute episode a week ... well, it seemed like there were more than 3 seasons worth.

5-stars for anyone who has fond memories of this show... for anyone else, this is probably too cheezy to recommend",1428192000,,550,4.5353535353535355
