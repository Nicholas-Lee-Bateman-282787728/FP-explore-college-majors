8013374,4,B0001JXOP8,"My first forray into this company's products turned out to be a pleasant surprise, as this offers some very erotic, sexy action, w/ little filler. The skinny - 5 sex scenes, all boy/girl, all with hot models and some full frontal. The 2 best scenes are toward the end & feature Monica Mayhem, the blonde, lithe, double D Australian adult film star. Been a fan of hers for a while - she's no Bette Davis here, but is sexy and delivers her lines adequately.

The story - A Lance Johnson wanna-be can't get his act together cycling, so his manager brings in a hot blonde to be his trainer/guru/masseuse. Do not get this flick seeking compelling drama. The story is a simple hook to hang a string of sexy vignettes on & it works.

The girls - 4 girls in the 5 sex scenes (3 model-esque, natural brunettes & 2 scenes w/ Monica). The 3 scenes w/ the brunettes - decent full frontal (some pink, no spreads), multi-position, some natural audio. The 2 scenes w/ Monica are very hot. One she gives a little massage to get things going - in both she's full frontal, multi-position and nice pink. Based on the title, I was looking for a bit more massage, hot oil fun, etc...but its fine.

The scenes - Looks to be shot on high-end digital like high def. Well lit so you can see the good stuff. Like AV, some scenes 8 minutes or more long, multi-position. The sex is clearly simulated but up close & personal, about a step away from cable edit porn, and better than skin-a-max (some ackwardness with arm & leg placement in the sex positions, as they try to ""hide"" views). Never can get enough pink, but there's some.

Ultimately, this is a nice, erotic piece, a great alternative if you're tired of the hard stuff. Pretty girls and sexy action at a nice price. FYI - 4 stars compared to similar skin flicks, not to Last Tango in Paris or some other real movie - sexy fun.",1145404800,29,1858,4.3768115942028984
