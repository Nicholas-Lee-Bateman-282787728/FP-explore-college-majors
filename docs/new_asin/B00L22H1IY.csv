6463254,5,B00L22H1IY,"This is an excellent yoga practice for people looking to integrate yoga into their fitness program. I bought it after following Stratus for years in Oxygen Magazine. I definitely feel like Stratus's approach is yoga for fitness. If you're looking for more of the hippy dippyness of yoga and mediation, then try a different practice. When I'm wanting that style, I do a practice from Shiva Rea or Kino McGregor. When I want to get on my mat and get a good, sweaty workout, I put in Stratusphere Yoga. This practice maximizes time with no extra frills and the practice is no joke. That being said, it is accessible to any beginner, but also challenges even the most fit person (crow pose, anyone?). I love the no-nonsense approach, the friendly demeanor of Stratus, and the flow itself. I almost forgot to mention how awesomely customizable the workouts are. There are 5 sessions of 10 minutes each. Each session pretty much works the entire body because of the nature of yoga, but they are tailored to work specific areas. Via the main menu, you can combine the 10 minute sessions to mix and match for the workout you need that day. So...maybe some days you do all 5 sessions for a 50 minute full body workout, or maybe you do legs, abs, and back one day, and shoulders, biceps, and triceps another day. What I love about this, is how easily it integrates into a weight training program. If you have a day you train your legs, or shoulders, or back, adding the 10 minute Stratusphere practice is an awesome way to get strength and stretching into your program. I'm so glad I purchased this DVD. Now, if only Stratus would come out with another. Fingers crossed that she does!",1420070400,9,1674,4.60200668896321
6463255,5,B00L22H1IY,"Love this workout too.  It is different, and really not very easy.  You might think that being a ""yoga"" inspired dvd that it would be easier, but it is not, which is good because it is challenging.  I also felt good after.  Not stiff and sore like my other workout dvds.  I highly recommend it as a change from the norm.",1416096000,3,320,4.180327868852459
6463256,4,B00L22H1IY,"This DVD is less of the Yoga and more of an actual intermediate workout!  It definitely helps that I love Trish Stratus and always have but man oh man does she kick your butt with this workout!  Definitely not a great ""beginners"" workout dvd and as I said before, its not really yoga.  It's a full on workout using some yoga moves as part of it.",1461715200,,345,4.196969696969697

6463258,5,B00L22H1IY,"I would rather do yoga at home than at the gym, so when I found Stratusphere Yoga, I was so excited. This DVD combines active yoga with strength training (through the weighted gloves that are recommended for each practice).  There are four different practices which target different parts of your body; you can do any or all of them. Trish Stratus is energetic and motivational, but not annoying or fake. There are modifications for yogis of all ability levels. I love that this DVD offers a yoga practice that is different than what most DVDs offer; it is energetic and I truly feel that it combines the best of both yoga (stretching, relaxation, refreshment) and an active workout (strength-training, increased heart rate, etc.).  I would recommend this to anyone trying to diversify their practice.",1438128000,2,801,4.970149253731344
6463259,5,B00L22H1IY,I like this video for days I need a shorter workout.  If I want an additional challah I just add weights to some of the moves.,1438041600,2,126,3.8461538461538463

6463261,5,B00L22H1IY,"Love this yoga routine, ""it flows"".  10 minute segments allow you to exercise for 10 or 50 minutes depending on time and energy. It does go fast and it is hard to watch and do some of the moves but it gets easier the more times you do it.  I am glad I bought this dvd.",1432684800,3,268,3.767857142857143

8663344,5,B00L22H1IY,"This is a great dvd. I had purchased it a few months ago and finally really started it January 1st. I have changed my diet and also do some other exercises on my own at home and I have lost 17lbs so far. I had only taken one yoga class in my life and I enjoyed it so I thought Id try this. I like how its separated into parts so you can either do 10 minutes at a time or all 50 minutes. Trish does move a bit fast but once you continually do it, you get used to it. Ive been of Trish since her wrestling days. This dvd is worth it. Enjoy!!",1521849600,,539,3.6956521739130435

8663347,5,B00L22H1IY,"Yoga routines are combined with weights either the exact pair Trish wears or you can get a decent cheaper pair online or your local sports store. The transitions are fast and are broken into 10 minute routines that are set to tone a specific body part. You will sweat, tone and gain endurance combine this with a sensable diet and these routines done each day will shrink the waist line. There are modifications given so anyone should be able to perform the moves and work to the advance version overtime yoga is a practice and practice makes perfect.
