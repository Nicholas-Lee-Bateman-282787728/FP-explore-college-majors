3736992,5,B001OZZZGO,I have vivid memories of watching Amos 'n Andy on television.  I loved the characters!  I wonder if many people know that Bill Cosby was instrumental in keeping this program from EVER being re-run on television?  He reportedly said that he thought it portrayed a negative image of Black people.  I disagree strongly and would ask whether the Kingfish was any less acceptable than George Jefferson or some of the other comedy leads we have seen?  I will always admire Sapphire as a strong woman with a flair for maintaining a well organized and orderly home in spite of the antics of the man in her life.  The show was gentle comedy from a more innocent time in our nation's history.,1090800000,55,682,4.595041322314049

3737008,1,B001OZZZGO,"Of the many hundreds of DVDs that I've purchased here in the past few years, the mislabeled ""71"" show box of AMOS 'N' ANDY, which was clearly made by this same outfit (photo is identical to my set and Product Description of contents matches exactly), has been by far the biggest disappointment.

Picture quality of these antique TV films varies from only fair to mostly very poor. In some, faces wash out to indistinct ghosts and all detail is lost. With others, they show evidence of being 4th or 5th generation copies of SLP speed tapes. Audio garbles badly on several episodes and is always of annoying midrange on others. A portion of every opening title sequence is missing. They're a total bummer to watch.

Obviously, you're interested in owning a collection of Amos 'n Andy shows or you wouldn't be here. This package is of such bad quality however that I urge you not to take a chance on it, as I so rashly did.",1281225600,2,920,4.536144578313253

The entire disc 7 did not have sound, and it contained some of the funniest episodes that I remember from my VHS days(example; ""The gun"").  Whoever produced this obviously did 0% of any quality checking and was so intent on getting it out to make money I feel they cheated the public out of some of the funniest comedy produced in the early years of television.

3737032,5,B001OZZZGO,"If you like classic TV, great writing, acting, and comedy get Amo N Andy! My Lord I can't stop laughing. This show was ahead of its time and it's a shame that after two successful years it was canceled. I wrote an in depth post on the issue with Amos n Andy and frankly I think it was a shame the show was canceled. The show, in my opinion,rivals ""Seinfeld."" Here is my take on what happened in 1953 when the show was canceled. Civil rights leaders demanded the show be canceled because blacks were being portrayed as half-wits. But, I am sure that for every negative attribute in Amos n Andy, there was one corresponding sitcom with white males being portrayed the same way. Think Costello, or Ralph Kramden for instance. If anything the fact the show was removed was an injustice for the black community. In the show you see black bankers, businessmen, lawyers, etc. Blacks living the American middle class life. Something you just didn't see in movies or shows of the 50's. The show was ground breaking. Think about it, we had to wait until the 80's to see blacks living a middle class life when America was introduced to ""Cosby."" But I always say in order for us to understand events which happened in history, we must look through that time's prism. And so, I do understand the urgency and fear the civil rights leaders had. But I tell you , when you see today's TV trash, one just longs to sit and watch true talent and comedy of a bygone era, no matter how the contemporaries of the 50's felt about it. And I still say, it was much ado about nothing, and sadly we will never know the positive impact it could've had.

I purchased the Amos n Andy series on DVD because I've always heard of it, but never saw it. I am so glad I did. The show is hilarious!  You will fall in love with the half-wit, but lovable Andy, con-man, but extremely funny, ""Kingfish,""  fast-talking, preacher like, Calhoun, and Amos, the quiet and philosophical cabdriver. Every woman will love Kingfish's wife Sapphire! A woman way ahead of her day.  Awesome writing and cast. I LOVE the show!

We all remembered watching Amos 'n Andy when we were children (before it was politically incorrect to find humor in anything about a different race regardless of the fact that Amos 'n Andy had the funniest story lines and great writers).  We never considered those shows anything but hilarious, and they were a part of our nightly TV ""must watch"".  We even remembered a lot of the episodes on these DVDs.

3737041,2,B001OZZZGO,"I think the reviewer ""CA"" [1-4-09] hit the nail on the head by commenting, and I agree forthwith, ""So, if you can look past the technical flaws, you will have a great laugh watching this collection.""

And 'technical flaws' being the operative consideration! The video transfer is, at best, fair [to poor] quality and the audio will have channel drop-outs [especially the left side but, as you know, even your stereo speakers are designed to pick up monaural sound and 'equally' distribute the monaural sound to both speakers] throughout the series. The 'bonus material' visuals are of such poor quality that I would have to rate it ""H"" ... for horrendous! There are also audio lip-sync issues on 'some' of the transfers but primarily the video appears to be a VHS transfer to DVD disk but often of fair to outright 'grainy' quality. Some episodes fare better than others in terms of video/audio issues. Play the bonus disks first [the end of disk 15 and all of disk 16] and see for yourself where the video is extremely poor quality and resembles an old B&W TV set trying to get a TV signal from an antenna located much too far away from the TV transmitter.

There were certainly no 'digitizing' techniques to improve the video taken in these transfers! It appears that mixed bag VHS tapes were simply transfered to disks ""as is"" [read: with their technical flaws] and note too that nowhere in the so-termed ""Platinum Edition"" set is there any mention whatsoever as to what commercial [?] entity produced these transfers. In effect, no commercial entity is ever mentioned on the rather flimsy ""box set"" that holds the 16 disks nor on the disks themselves. This alone [especially when there is no mention of copyright issues much less any mention of the entity who put the thing together] makes the whole product itself rather questionable but, alas, and that being the case, with predictable audio/visual quality [lack of] results therein!

BTW, the documentary, ""Amos 'N Andy : Anatomy of a Controversy"" and hosted by George Kirby is included in the bonus section. I only mention this because I note that this documentary is sold separately at Amazon but is already 'included' in this set in the bonus section. Interesting because in that documentary, and granted that the well known NAACP 'opposition' to the show was duly mentioned, the show and its focus on ""comedy"" [versus, as Marla Gibbs duly and aptly pointed out, "" ... it is not presented as a documentary"" [sic]] was 'defended' in the documentary and for the verbalized reasons given by those who participated in the documentary. As personal note and other than the, in fact, ""comedy"" focus of the series and its characters, it was the ONLY show at the time where Blacks 'other' than the comedic characters were shown in the professions a la dentists, doctors, law enforcement, business folks, et al, not to mention the 'fact' that in almost every case the 'manipulations' of the ""Kingfish"" usually backfired on him while the duly employed, family oriented and quite level headed ""Amos"" provided the running commentary for the ""Kingfish"" and the likeable but gullible ""Andy Brown"" [""Helllllooooooo!""] character. But again, the focus was comedy [as Gibbs pointed out -- just as Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton were not to mention many others ] and as played by professional Black artists at that time [and indeed a rarity on TV in the early 50's!] yet the accompanying players [other than the cast] and often depicted working in the professions were hardly, IMO, 'demeaning'.

In any event, 71 episodes plus extended bonus material for under $35 is a bargain but I must agree that the audio 'and' visual quality of the transfers left much to be desired.

3737042,5,B001OZZZGO,"I purchased this Amos and Andy DVD set as a Christmas Present for my parents and they still laugh out loud every time they watch it. All of the episodes are hilarious and they look great on our new Flat Screen TV. The menus are fantastic. You just select the episode that you want to watch and there it is. With over 70 episodes for under 35 dollars (that is less than 50 cents per episode) it is definitely worth the price.
I would recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of Amos & Andy. You will absolutely love it.",1231891200,12,519,4.098039215686274
3737043,1,B001OZZZGO,"First off, the set is not entirely ""complete,"" as there are five or six episodes that are described as ""missing.""  I realize that alternative sets of Amos 'n Andy are not exactly thick on the vine, thanks to this country's terminal case of political correctness, but the production in question is inexcusably amateurish.  Most of the opening frames are chopped off, video quality is fuzzy most of the time, and audio level varies significantly from one episode to the next.  Most amazing of all are the god-awful typos in the menu titles.  Didn't anybody check these over before the discs were placed on the market?

BTW, the set includes four MP3 CDs filled with radio shows from the era before television happened along and fully captured public attention.  Three of the CDs are devoted to old ""Amos 'n Andy"" radio programs.  While these vignettes from the past are often fun to listen to, I have to cite once again the very sloppy production values that went into this set.  Many of the radio episodes appear more than once on the three CDs, and the menu files accessible on the discs are hopelessly confusing.  No consistent list format was used!  Titles of episodes are often in error and can even be difficult to find at all, and most air dates are not clearly specified either.  One saving grace is that episode filenames often ARE provided, and the air dates can easily be derived from these.  For example, ""aa411224"" was broadcast on 12/24/41.",1231372800,61,1452,4.741035856573705

However, the film to video transfer is low quality.  The DVD's appear to be duplicated from VHS tape.  The audio suffers from a small & continuous amount of distortion, occasional channel drop-outs and audio/video sync delays.  Some of these technical issues do originate with the film copies and are common in many low budget productions of this era.

So, if you can look past the technical flaws, you will have a great laugh watching this collection.",1231027200,14,667,4.747826086956522
3737046,5,B001OZZZGO,"Why Amos N Andy was banned, and still is, makes no sense whatsoever. You will never regret purchasing this DVD collection, as it is one that you will  watch again and again.

George ""Kingfish"" Stevens and Andy Brown are two unique, unforgetable characters that will make you laugh your guts out. The Kingfish is a wacky con-artist who is always trying to trick Andy out of his money. Although Andy always gets suckered into one of the Kingfish's schemes, he generally comes out ahead, but not always.

The Kingfish heads The Mystic Knights of the Sea lodge. The lodge hall is his home away from home, as going out and getting a job is the main thing in life that the Kingfish tries to avoid.

The one thing the Kingfish fears more than anything else in the world is his wife, Sapphire, and the one thing he despises most of all is ""Mama,"" Sapphire's mother, who always refers to the Kingfish as ""Baldy.""

Amos, perhaps the only sensible member of the cast, is a taxi driver. You can always count on Amos to give good, practical advice. On the other hand, there is Algonquin J. Calhoun, a shister lawyer who really isn't a lawyer at all. The Kingfish always turns to Calhoun for help or advice and, or course, Calhoun always gets the Kingfish deeper into trouble.

The Amos N Andy cast is comprised of some of the most talented actors and actresses in the history of comedy. The shows are fast paced, and there's never a dull moment.

Amos n Andy was sheer gut renching comedy. It is ashame that their acting was not seen for what it was - absolute hysterical comedy.  Amos n Andy was no more stereotypical than the Wayans, Good Times, Sanford & Son, or other similar black comedy sitcoms.  The Three Stooges was full of mayhem, Amos n Andy was equally as funny.  See it for what it is - comedy.  Amos n Andy brought a good mix of characters, from silly to serious - they displayed comedy at its best.  The quality of some of the shows are a little foggy, but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the shows.",1152576000,26,722,4.226277372262774

3737060,5,B001OZZZGO,"The Kingfish , Sapphire, Andy Brown, Algonquin J.Calhoun, Amos, were the main characters on certainly one of the most amusing radio, and then later television comedy series America has known. The Kingfish and his schemes, and good old Andy trying to figure out what to do, and Sapphire scolding Kingfish, and Amos all sweet- righteousness and gentle reason, and Algonquin J. Calhoun the wide eyed big horn-rimmed glasses little lawyer talking up a double- talk storm. These characters were a great source of amusement to my late parents.

I know in later years there was controversy about this show being demeaning to blacks. And the truth it did play on certain stereotypes, but its fundamental spirit was a warmly human comic one, laughing at the kinds of foibles and stupidities we all meet everyday from the people we know, and from ourselves.

3737061,4,B001OZZZGO,The Amos & Andy box set are 44 classic comedy episodes.  The only downside is the quality of the video which is from either 16 or 32 mm film.  It doesn't detract from the humor in the writing and acting.,1140912000,16,203,4.05

Although controversial, you can't help but to laugh and the satire and buffoonery. Anyone who saw and enjoyed Spike Lee's Bamboozled, would definitely appreciate this American masterpiece from which Bamboozled was based on.

However, the quality of the video was a little suspect. Most likely, it was converted directly from old VHS tapes directly onto DVD. With no video or audio enhancement what so ever. So, if you think you're going to get DVD quality, think again.

That said, this is a good DVD set, but the asking price should be a little less considering it's poor quality.",1140825600,25,680,5.008849557522124

I was completely unaware of any controversy. It was just (to me as a kid) flat out the funniest show on TV. After watching these shows again I can say without hesitation that if they were shown today.....they'd still be the funniest shows on television! Forget the bad transfer quality issues and just examine the brilliant acting and brilliant writing and brilliant directing.....after 50 years it still holds up! These performers have gone too long without recognition. Their families, their legacies, their contribution deserve our respect and gratitude for leaving us this Crown Jewel of comedy. The fact that they were forced into the underground by a few well meaning leaders actually had the reverse affect and stigmatized them forever. The Amos and Andy Show is the Zenith of situation comedies. Any example you can own albeit poor quality or not is a must for any serious devotee of classic family comedy TV shows. Along with the Honeymooners this show has no equal in the history of situation comedy. Run (don't walk) and get it today!",1139788800,26,1201,4.834951456310679

3737067,5,B001OZZZGO,"I recently purchased this box set, and although I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, I was pleasantly surprised at the overall excellence of this TV show.  It was just as good as I remembered it.  It stands the test of time very well; the humor is still funny, the acting is world-class and timeless, and the writing is at least as good, and in most cases better, than most of the crappy shows that are on TV today, in which the humor consists of little else but a bunch of bitchy wise-asses insulting each other.

  The real tragedy of the politically correct, Orwellian scourging from the public consciousness of this artistic masterpiece is that these outstanding actors will never receive the fame, honor and respect that they so richly deserve.

  Every actor in this series should receive a retroactive EMMY Award, Lifetime Achievement Awards from every Academy, and a place of honor in every Hall of Fame that relates to television history, not to mention the undying gratitude of every African American organization, and especially the black actors and comedians of today who stand upon the shoulders of these pioneers who blazed the trail that they follow so effortlessly and take for granted so casually.

  But the so-called Academies are not really in the business of encouraging and rewarding excellence; they're actually nothing more than public relations shills, bought and paid for by the TV industry, who exist solely to convince you, the viewing public, that the mindless crap you're watching is actually worthy of an award.  And if you're in the business of peddling crap, the last thing you want is for people to remember what real excellence used to look like.",1134000000,,1687,4.8807017543859645

But, you can't FF through scenes which is always a little disappointing.  Anyway, save some money, avoid the ""Official"" version everyone hear complains about, and get yourself the less expensive set.  I doubt you will be disappointed and there'll be no reason to contact Algonquin J. Calhoun about this.

3737079,1,B001OZZZGO,"These are pretty much the same knock-offs that have been around for years and years. As such, the technical quality varies from acceptable to downright awful. Some of the discs wouldn't load in my older DVD player. Especially grating for trivia buffs are the truncated openings and the deleted (!) end credits.

At least one of the episodes is mislabeled on the disc, and several have video ""noise"" on them to the point where the picture is intermittently lost.

If you're considering buying this set because you think that somehow the 16mm network backups have miraculously been uncovered and commited to disc, forget it. These are the same copies of copies of copies you already have.

On the upside, even BAD Amos N' Andy is better than NO Amos N' Andy, and this set is a good deal chaper (by at least half!) than many others advertised on the internet. If you really enjoy the show, don't mind the so-so quality, and don't feel like paying two or three hundred bucks for basically the same collection, this set is actually a pretty good deal.

I would like to add for the record that TIM MOORE, the man who portrayed the Kingfish, was one of the two or three funniest men who ever played the small screen. In my book, he is easily right up there with Benny, Burns and Gleason.

Few remember Moore, though, primarily because he was black. That fact alone is infinitely more racist that Amos N' Andy ever dreamed of being.",1102896000,51,1424,4.590551181102362

Having all the series is great. Remembering these Great actors is great.  Very funny.

However, the DVD's are so bad, the viewer misses so much and thus the viewer cannot really enjoy it.

The boxed set is trash.  The slip cases are cheap trash.

I looked at the Undersides of the DVS and they were scratched.

I have the feeling they were used and abused.
