8363924,5,B002CEPT6C,This is one of the most depressing stories I have ever seen about how the U.S. punished a highly regarded professor who spoke out about Palestinian reality truthfully.  It should cure any flag-waver who thinks that there is really freedom of speech or belief in the United States today.  The venomous and duplicitous treatment of Al Arian by the American Government should shame every American who didn't take the opportunity to speak out on this appalling story.  This should be a must-see reality-check for patriots to show them how to make the U.S. the country it is supposed to be..,1479081600,,586,4.84
8363925,5,B002CEPT6C,"The US Department of Justice prosecutes a Muslim academic and political leader on phony charges of terrorism.  When the Florida jury finds no evidence for any convictions, the prosecutor goes rogue, placing the professor in a series of high-security prisons, often in solitary and keeping family visits to a bare minimum.  Eventually Dr. Al-Arian is placed under house arrest in Virginia, where he remains, possibly for life.

This documentary, beautifully filmed and more heart-wrenching than any invented story could ever be, brings the raw terrorism of ""overzealous prosecution"" of Muslims in America to life.",1359504000,5,612,5.48936170212766
8363926,5,B002CEPT6C,"Previous reviewers who were unable to 'view' the film should not punish the film-maker for technical problems..seems like a built in method to downgrade this remarkable documentary...and likely that a 1-star rating was another way to denigrate an exceptional narrative.

I've watched this film when it was first released, then again, when LINKTV presented it a number of times over several months time, as a special release. Later I purchased the dvd & played it several times for others or myself. After watching it, each time I felt overwhelmed with a a sense of sadness, grief and outrage at the enormous miscarriage of justice in this case;  also, the the failed leadership which allowed years of injustice to prevail, particularly, the years of Dr. Al Arian's (pre-trial) incarceration and ensuing  needless suffering & mistreatment of one man and his family. The clumsy (politically motivated)  mishandling and apparent bias with lack of evidence, context or balance  led the jury to exonerate him on all the charges, nearly unanimously.

The trial's conclusion, however, is not the end but rather a 'beginning' (this is not ""spoiler""reveal)  because the jury's deliberation and Not Guilty Verdict, after six months' trial, was not the end of their nightmare but became instead the prosecutor's intention to shift legal tactics. The expenses of the legal representation cost them everything - (home, career of a ""tenured"" professor, retirement/savings for childrens' college),  only the tip of the iceberg.  He remained mostly an 'invisible' political prisoner, in the midst of issues which are ""third rail"" American politics: as Americans are now learning - the ultimate taboo - to be an activist who speaks out against the 40+ year brutal Israeli military occupation of his parents' homeland, Palestine- a true homeland where all his ancestors lived for more than 1000 years, despite Ottoman, British occupations until the pivotal year, 1948, (Nakbah-Catastrophe) which included the ethnic cleansing of nearly 800,000 people from their homeland.

In the end, despite years of great duress and struggle, the Al-Arian family managed remained resolute & deeply, lovingly connected - attributable to Dr. Sami's love for his family along with his wife (Nahla's) determination to hold it  together with humanity & dignity for their remarkable children.

The film could only have been made by a non American observer as his name/story was amply suppressed in US msm.  Applause and Hats off! to Norwegian director (Halvorsen)  & crew for providing the world with intimate insight into a wretched story of injustice.  (Also, I highly recommend his book ""Conspiring Against Joseph"" at amazon books.)",1320710400,4,2697,5.327830188679245
8363927,1,B002CEPT6C,"I wish I could have seen this in order to provide a review of the content, but the DVD I received would not play - it makes a loud mechanical noise and that's it. Checked DVD player with other DVDs and there was no problem. The DVD I received is NTSC for all regions so it should work. Returned for a refund. I'm very disappointed.",1287878400,,331,4.107692307692307
