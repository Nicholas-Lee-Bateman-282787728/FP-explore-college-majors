8485959,5,B005T7C1BU,Charming film about a small community of Baltimore-based stay-at-home Dads. You get the feeling these guys really care about their new found roles as full time care givers. The movie explores the process which they've taken and the lessons they're learning. Fun movie.,1407024000,,268,5.255813953488372
8485960,1,B005T7C1BU,"At first I was very surprised to discover a documentary on the subject and quite eager to see it. Disappointment came in very fast though.

Quite naive and amateur misrepresentation of what could be an enriching social change, all be it due to malicious causes. The movie gives an impression of an outdated ""reality-show"" about a bunch of male babysitters, constrained to a single demographic of a suburban dads, with mostly toddlers sampled from just a hand-full of states. These guys are predominantly ""accidental"" fathers, forced to stay at home due to employment issues (unsurprisingly most laid off from government jobs). Stay at home dad by Choice is not even touched upon.

And what is this ""support group"" cliche? For recovering bread-winners and home-wife wannabes? Really, do these men have any self-esteem? Just because public education destroyed their imagination does not mean they are constrained by play-dates and going to playground every day. The whole depiction of poor Us vs conservative Them in this movie is diverting from the bigger subject of family institution being destroyed, which of cause is not talked about much either.

Movie does not address anything beyond subjective feelings on subject ""Ooh, isn't it weird there is a guy with his kid on a playground"". Subjects like education and development, phycological and emotional growth are not stressed much beyond a couple of comments by ""professional"" social scientist. Again, due to a limited group of dads represented, one gets an impression that these guys indeed are not suited for much beyond babysitting (with probably one or two quick comments about ""tough love"" style of treating kids).

Last thing. There is a saying ""The boat will sail as well as you name it"". Adopting the SAHD moniker, even with ""Happy"" prefix, will subconsciously lead general public to adopt a negative perception of the phenomenon, which is not helping the case.

I hope next take on the subject is going to be more mature.

Good luck.",1357257600,,1996,5.08868501529052
