3487952,3,B001BBAVP6,"Alex is a college graduate whose parents got him a job at a law firm, but what he really wants to do is play poker. He meets Tommy Vinson, a former poker pro who promised his wife 20 years ago that he'd never play again, and has kept his promise. Tommy becomes Alex's mentor and stakes him in tournaments.

""Deal"" has  some not-so-subtle product placement (PokerStars and World Poker Tour) and the story is like a poker remake of ""The Color of Money"", but the actors are good and it's entertaining if you like poker and don't mind that it's a bit predictable. Several poker pros appear as themselves, including Antonio Esfandiari, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem and Phil Laak, whose girlfriend Jennifer Tilly also appears, not as herself but as a poker pro. 3 stars.",1255996800,6,759,4.614814814814815
3487953,5,B001BBAVP6,"I was surprised at how good this movie is. They dared to go against the hollywood formulas, and I saw that the 'Critic' in the yahoo reviews did not even watch it, which is obvious from his commentary. I guess the makers of this movie did not give any kick back to the powers that be. A very very good movie. I have recommended this movie to three pals I have who each said they were not intersted, I did not let up though and they saw it just to get me off their backs. Two of them ended up buying it. This is one of those movies that was shot down by a few couple people with an axe to grind, its really good. Has some real life messages about prostitution, commitment and honor.",1250553600,4,681,4.051851851851852
3487954,4,B001BBAVP6,"Move over Rounders...this film will rock the poker world!  Brilliant movie with superb acting from a mixture of both actors and professional poker players, (including the beautiful Jennifer Tilly who is both).  Great story..puts the sub-par poker film Lucky You to shame.  Although Bret Harrison is no Matt Damon, both he and Burt Reynolds shine and sparkle separately and together.  Great poker action and Mike Sexton and Vince Van Patten play their usual delightful selves as the World Poker Tour announcers.  The lovely Courtney Friel, (who now works for Fox News), also plays herself as she indeed used to gig for the WPT.  Poker pros Phil Laak and Antonio Esfandiari also are natural actors and many other pros make cameo appearances.  And the very sexy Shannon Elizabeth, (of American Pie fame), really heats things up as the love interest of Harrison.  My only minor quibble with the film is that these two don't reunite at the end.  Oh, and Burt's make-up is a bit much.  But overall, a must-see for all poker fans!",1238025600,3,1023,4.861271676300578
3487955,1,B001BBAVP6,"Deal is poker movie that tells the story of a retired poker player that tutors a younger player who is a great online poker player but has yet to master the art of playing cards in person. The retired player is Tommy Vinson,who gave up gambling more than 20 years ago,hopes to save his family by returning to the game. While the young player is Alex Stillman,a Yale senior who has a knack for Texas Hold 'Em,dreams of dominating poker tables in Vegas.

This is definitely one of the worse movies about poker if not the worst. First of all,it is a rip-off of The Color Of Money especially with regards to the teacher-protoge relationship that is central to the story in a poker setting instead of billiards from the said movie. Then,we have the poor performances of the Burt Reynolds and Bret Harrison. Both apparently were interested in the paycheck they are about to receive. Also,we have a lot of confusion in the story particularly the character of Michelle,who happens to be Alex's lover considering that she was written off so soon in the movie. Finally,it was cliched,predictable and not very entertaining. It won't even make a person get interested about what poker is all about. The only good thing I could say about it is it managed to have cameos of world-class poker players. Nothing more.

For better films of the same genre,watch Rounders and Lucky You instead.",1407888000,,1374,4.720833333333333
3487956,4,B001BBAVP6,"I did not expect much and maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much!  Fun to see Burt Reynolds again and, as a poker player myself, I am familiar with both the game and the players in the film.  I bet Jen had a lot of fun telling the kid to go back to college when she flipped over her set of tens!  It's hard to make a decent poker movie and I thought this one was terrific.  No, the end is not realistic --- but this is a movie and it's got a heart..  Enjoy it for what it is --- entertainment, not a poker tutorial.",1404345600,,514,3.7663551401869158

I highly recommend this courteous and professional seller.

I was very happy to get this dvd which I have viewed many times over.  It is also serves as a teaching tool for poker players.  This is definitely one of my favorite all time poker movies.  Thank you.",1364947200,,337,4.55

3487959,1,B001BBAVP6,"This movie blows!  The only good part in the entire movie is Shannon Elizabeth's 5 minutes of fame.  If you love poker and texas hold 'em movies then don't watch this one!

3487960,4,B001BBAVP6,"Great fun for card players and solid acting makes this an enjoyable movie.  It's all about risk...love...and trust.  The plot is predictable as it unfolds, but this flick hits the mark. Bret Harrison and Burt Reynolds hold this film together.  The rookie and his mentor square off in the world of gambling and within the world of reality.  Shannon Elizabeth's brief but poignant role glues the storyline together.  Four stars for the pure entertainment value.",1322611200,3,459,5.066666666666666
3487961,2,B001BBAVP6,"Yup.  I gave one star each for each minute of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time.  Otherwise it would have been zero stars!  Basically ""Color of Money"" remake with tired old poker clichs.",1292889600,2,184,4.870967741935484
3487962,2,B001BBAVP6,"""Deal"" is the oldie about the retired card shark - who's sworn off the game for love of a good woman - who serruptitiously takes a promising young whippersnapper under his wing to train him in the fine art of high-stakes poker.  Burt Reynolds is the leathery old pro and Bret Harrision his green, but cocky pupil who together head to Vegas and New Orleans for an intense session of training and instruction.  But will Tommy be able to resist the lure of the tables and not mount a comeback of his own?  And will we finally wind up with the card shark and the neophyte squaring off in a televised multi-million-dollar tournament to determine the very best poker player in the whole wide world?  I'll see you one and raise you one on that particular bet.

As a subject for film, poker is already one of the least compelling forms of competition there is, and ""Deal"" does little to rectify that situation.  Moreover, the characters and plotlines are so hopelessly hackneyed and uninspired that we spend most of our time just waiting for the scenes to play themselves out.  Harrison lacks charisma as the upstart newbie, but Reynolds brings a degree of gravitas to his overly-familiar role of a has-been trying to achieve the victory and personal glory he missed out on the first time around.

But you'll wind up feeling as enervated as the players long before the final hand is played.",1284336000,,1382,4.635245901639344
3487963,2,B001BBAVP6,"First I'd just like to say that Mr. Charles Durning is a cast member on this movie.
I think Mr. Charles Durning is a tremendously talented actor who incidentally has led a most interesting and adventurous life. His Mr. Healey in Captains and Kings was incredible! Now,to the movie. Comparing Deal to Rounders is like comparing a
 pair of roller skates to a Rolls Royce because they're both vehicles. The cast seemed to try but it just didn't work.",1265932800,,447,4.658227848101266
3487964,2,B001BBAVP6,"Someone has to point out that the moral of this story is: ""Don't go to work. Go play poker and you'd make millions (easily; almost everybody does)"". Or: ""Playing professional poker is a productive contribution to society"". Or: ""If you show them you bring enough money, your parents will forget their plans for your future and support you"".
There is a minor lateral message: ""Prostitution is ok, as long as you tell your customer that you are a pro, so he does not fall in love with you. The problem lies in lying, not in prostitution itself"".

I cannot imagine what kind of influence could this movie have on impressionable kids.

It is entertaining all right (one star goes for that), but it certainly cannot be ""very very good"". After all, it features Burt Reynolds, an actor with a long career of making bad, irrelevant, white-trash movies.",1256428800,,843,4.727891156462585

8282567,1,B001BBAVP6,"Wow, where to begin? Have you ever watched a movie that parodies another movie? The acting is purposefully bad to make the characters seem stupid.  This movie was like like that, but without the comedy.

If you know anything about poker you will find this movie predicable and boring. You could almost put it in the catagory of a porn movie. The acting and writing were that bad.

If you know nothing about poker, it's insulting to ones intelligence. Just stay away.

An 8 year old might like it but nobody with even a few brain cells

One of the worst movies EVER!!!",1409270400,,567,4.466019417475728
