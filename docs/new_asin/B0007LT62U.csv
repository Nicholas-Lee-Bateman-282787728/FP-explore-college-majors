He has a partner who stands around awkwardly with his hands at his sides not saying a word. When he does speak it is mumbled. It is obvious that he is just learning and the beer is being made at his home and he is just observing the process. Often times his children show up and ask questions and stand in the way. kids do that but, not in an instructional video.

The whole flow is stunted and the camera work could be better. There is a time to cut away and end a scene. This does not happen and it drags things out. Like when they are racking the beer. Old Mr sidekick is crouching down not saying anything but is still in the frame as the camera zooms into the carboy for a long pause at the krausen and the temp of the carboy.

It is good that this is a discontinued product as there is no loss. If you want to get a great instructional video then checkout [...] or search Amazon using the phrase 'basic brewing' You will find all of their videos here on Amazon. They are great and have no creepy mute sidekick, kids and dogs appearing out of nowhere and long drawn out camera shots.

All in all this video does not get the job done. Like I stated before the main presenter is knowledgeable he just didn't get the job done in this video.",1272326400,,1356,4.1679389312977095
8228821,2,B0007LT62U,"It was ok but not very professionally taped. There were instances of a kid and dog interupting filming. While they were focasing on keeping everything very sterile, the dog kept standing over the beer and a lot of background noise and interuptions by the kid. Other than that, it was interesting watching the process.",1180051200,3,317,4.888888888888889
