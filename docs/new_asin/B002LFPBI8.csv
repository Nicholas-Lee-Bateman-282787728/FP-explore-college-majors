3945925,5,B002LFPBI8,"This movie has tremendous heart and is absolutely fabulous on a couple of different levels. First and foremost it's about a wonderful and fascinating character -- what a life this man has had! And what a man Mr. Beers is. He has character, heart, intelligence, and a wonderful sense of authentic humanity. This very human story deserves to be seen by everyone who values the human spirit and I think it's a wonderful movie for young and old as a role model. I think it's an absolutely great movie as well, the director has crafted the story in a captivating way that held my attention from beginning to end. I can't think of a greater gift to give someone than to give them this movie. I hope it gets the audience that it deserves.",1257638400,5,731,4.462686567164179

3946075,5,B002LFPBI8,"I have been in a funk lately after the death of a beloved relative.  I needed...something, and I found that this was it.

Jack Beers was a very amazing guy.  He put his all into his life, succeeding at all the various things he tried.  I had never heard of him but apparently he is a famous and much admired figure in New York city and elsewhere, and this film shows why.

Never have I seen anyone with so much enthusiasm for life as this man showed. Even at 94, he was talking animatedly about all he had done, keeping a running dialog going about all the amazing things he accomplished and did.

His greatest accomplishment was shortening the length of World War 2 by inventing machinery that shortened the time required to make atomic bombs.  Our boys were dying by the thousands overseas in the war, and whoever made the atomic bomb first would win.  It was that simple.  But the time frame for producing the weapon was going to be over a year, and during that time the terrible war would be going on, with millions dying.  Enter the hero, Jack Beers, the greatest structural engineer in the country and probably the world.  And he was self taught.

The list of Jack's accomplishments is long, including over 200 films that Jack appeared in, including seven Woody Allen movies.  What an incredible man he was, and this tells his story looking back on his life from the vantage point of the age of 94.

After watching this, all inertia seemed to melt from my body and I now have a renewed interest in life, and making it all it can be.  This is terribly inspiring and moving and shows what one person can make of his life.

This won several awards for best documentary.  I do feel everyone should see this.  And, let's not forget, the United States of America offers the same opportunites to everyone, even a dirt poor immigrant kid like Jack was, with holes in his shoes.",1362873600,3,1875,4.448680351906158

Jack Beers is a New Yorker who has seen everything New York has had to offer for almost 100 years! He grew up as a hard working young man and worked his way up to being very successful. He hold many interesting an unrelated occupations in his life and has a infectious positive energy.

The documentary follows his life from a very early age up until his current age. He tells many stories in his own words and also with the help of other people who knew him, worked with him and grew up with him. Jack is just one of those people who you cant stand but love. He is happy and fully of joy and is a hard worker who earned everything that he has.

All in all, this is a great documentary. If you enjoy hearing interesting stories from older people who have a lot of wisdom to pass on, you will love this movie.",1362787200,,925,4.191011235955056

3946078,5,B002LFPBI8,i saw this on netflix and wanted to see it because it was about a man in his 90s so i thought it would have things about his lifestyle as far as eating and things like that which had contributed to his longevity. Well it had none of that except when younger how he was into exercise like weight lifting and no smoking or drinking but it wasn't about nutrition it was about his life. I think that his positive attitude and outlook and enthusiasm for life contributed to his long life. I fell in love with Jack. His laughter and excitement was contagious and had me wishing I could be half of what he was like and of course had me wishing I could have met him. It is rare to find people like that - he was a treasure for sure.  Loved that throughout his life he was in different careers and what his dad said about not caring what he did in life but whatever he did to do and be the best in it - really inspiring and beautiful documentary.,1361145600,,937,4.092391304347826

One of the best biographical documentaries of a famous person that no one has heard of. This DVD follows Jack Beers from his difficult youth to his 90s. His story is inspirational and his contributions to America were not only innumerable but they can still be seen today. My wife and I saw this on a United flight to Sydney (lots of movie choices in business class) and this was by far the best of the lot. I ordered a copy for my children to watch.

see the dvd in its entirety. It was a riveting view of one man,
living his life to its fullest, and taking every opportunity
opened to him, using talents he had, and others he acquired along
the way. Major skyscrapers; The Empire State Bldg and others; Buildings
(Lincoln Cntr and others in Manhattan, have this mans' workmanship and
innovations.

He lived through 90-plus years during very tough times in America.
Yet, he got through them with hard work, dignity and a greatful heart.

Therefore, the fact that this Amazon vendor had the dvd I so wanted,
in stock, and supplied it to me in the exact manner he stated, in 'new'
condition, and in the 'time' he projected, made me a very satisfied customer.

My order was for two dvds from this vendor; one for me, and the other
going to a friend with a different shipping address. So, needless to say,I am
very pleased with the service provided and, the dvd my friend and I now own.",1318550400,,995,4.516666666666667

This is wonderful to watch as a family, by yourself or with someone special.  Mr. Beers had such a loving spirit. He seemed to live his life so matter of factly with wonderful things happening to him on a continual basis, with the exception of losing his beautiful wife, Bertha...his heart was so broken but he triumphed!! I love the way he just did everything he wanted to in life and shared it with so many.  He was successful on so many levels.  I promise at the end you will have the biggest smile on your face with bittersweet tears.  Every second of this documentary is a gift.  For those of you who were lucky to know Mr. Beers, I applaud you and I can only imagine the positive impact he had on your lives and the beautiful love you have for him.  It was such a great documentary that I didn't want it to end.  Buy this DVD, you will not be sorry.  In fact, you will probably want to buy a few copies as gifts for loved ones.",1260921600,15,1075,4.195121951219512
