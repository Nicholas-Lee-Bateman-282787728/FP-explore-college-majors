8471369,2,B005G815Y6,"Smiley goes across the country (Philly, Chicago, Oakland, inter alia) speaking to Black boys and men (and some Black women) about what can be done to educate more African-American males. Rather than doing lots of narrating, the work consists mostly of Smiley letting his interviewees do the talking.  This may ""keep it real,"" but it does get a bit dull at times.

This work does a great job of showing men and boys who transformed academically.  Smiley admits that he didn't like school for many years.  A brother in charge of a department of corrections admitted that he was once an inmate.  This shows several boys who one day decided to become academically focused.  However, many of these boys transferred from the school down the street to schools that catered to their unique needs or demographic.  I don't know if that's a choice that most Black males have.  If I heard correctly, No Child Left Behind allows students to leave a school that's failing IF another school is willing to take them, which is not often the case.

Along these lines, the work shows Black males in a special school where they seem to be the majority of students.  The CEO (Lightbulb!  Not ""principal,"" but ""CEO.""  This makes me think this is a private entity.) said students and teachers of any race or gender can apply.  But if I remember correctly, the Supreme Court ruled in the 1990s that all Black male public schools were illegal.  It's not the presence of female students that stunts learning, it's other factors.  Plus, gender segregation could open an unfortunate door and return to racial segregation.  This majority Black male school reminded me visually of Morehouse, but I don't know if that option is truly available in large numbers.

As soon as I saw the title of this program, I wondered if Jawanza Kunjufu would show up, and he does.  However, he doesn't pelt Smiley with statistics like he does in many speeches.  He doesn't make homophobic statements, unlike his books which many say contains lots of that bigotry.  Non-Black and non-male viewers need not be ""intimidated"" by this work as they show teachers of different races and genders teaching these Black males.  Smiley asserts that the enrichment of Black boys should be every person's mission.

Fighting is only brought up briefly in this work.  One educator says, ""This school works because Black male students see different Black men getting along and cooperating.""  Nothing of pressure from gangs comes up in this work.  In the south suburbs of Chicago where I live, schools have complained that fighting has increased as their student populations get Blacker.  I have a Black friend who quit teaching after just one year because he said he felt more like a referee than an educator.  So, I don't want to stereotype, but the issue of Black-on-Black student violence is only hinted at here.

One interviewee calls his classmates and himself ""Little Obamas.""  Many Blacks, including myself, have been riled by how Smiley and Dr. C. West have been so harsh toward our President.  Luckily, Smiley doesn't condemn our leader in this work.  Smiley, btw, has put on some weight over the years.  Not to diss; I'm just saying.)

Education is contrasted to prison here and that doesn't surprise me as many people (including myself) who support affirmative action and oppose mass incarceration have noted how states have no problems paying to lock up Black males, but are reluctant to educate them.  Smiley flips things here, however.  He interviews incarcerated males who are using their ""down time"" to enhance their academics.

This work, shockingly, reminded me of bell hooks' ""Sisters of the Yam,"" a work on the challenges facing Black, female students.  In both, it's reported that violence, hunger, mental illness, inter alia are phenomena that prevent Blacks from being able to focus on their studies.  I suggest folk that like this Smiley program may want to peruse hooks' text.",1317340800,2,3937,4.918057663125948
