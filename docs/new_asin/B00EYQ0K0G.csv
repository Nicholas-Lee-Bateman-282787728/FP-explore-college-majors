8610418,5,B00EYQ0K0G,"I purchased this album on CD when I was 14 years old. I was blown away by this album to say the least. Don't get me wrong, the production on the CD was remarkable, and I never once thought ""This would be much better if they would just remaster it..."" Now that I've heard the 5.1 DVD...I don't know if I can ever hear it in stereo the same again.

First off, let's talk about the production. The CD had a great sound to it. It was loud, but not too loud. The dynamics were mixed to a point where nothing was out of place. Not once did I complain about the sound quality of the album in stereo. This new disk, however, takes the ""How Does Your Garden Grow"" experience to the next level. In 2011, I was reading where Better Than Ezra had made plans to remaster this album but I was thinking....""not that it needs it"" back then. I loved the CD, but I was still excited over seeing a reissue surface just because of how hard this thing is to find. This was not what I expected at all. This was something else...entirely.

As soon as I heard they remastered the album in 5.1 surround on DVD-Audio, I became even more interested. I was unfamiliar with the format. I knew major audiophile productions were released of iconic rock albums such as ""Dark Side of the Moon"" in 5.1, but I'm a little old school. I loved the CD and still do, but if/when HDYGG gets a vinyl reissue, you bet I'll be the first in line. This I figured would be the next best thing. So I finally hooked up 5.1 surround sound in my studio, and decided to give it a shot. So I ordered this little gem and gave it a spin...I had expectations of better sound quality, but this was a whole new experience for me. Quite possibly the best listening experience I've ever had with any album in any format. This WILL take your breath away.

There are instrument tracks in this recording that I never knew were there judging by what I heard on the CD. I was hearing piano tracks and guitar licks that were unfamiliar to me. See, the production on the CD was amazing but I didn't know how much was really squeezed in there until I heard this. This new format gives the album so much more room to breathe. There's a lot of ""hard to hear"" moments in the CD that I can hear now because I know they're there, but otherwise would have never discovered. The CD sounds compressed to me now after hearing the 2 channels spread through 5.1.

Now for those of you out there (Ezralites and non-Ezralites alike) that may be unfamiliar with this recording in general, I will say this isn't typical Better Than Ezra. BTE are one of those bands that come around once in a while and never record a bad album. I have never been disappointed, though I'm sure in 1998 most fans were used to the twangy hooks of ""Deluxe"" or the hard hitting edge of ""Friction, Baby"" but this is a whole new direction. And that's what I like about Ezra...you can never be sick of them because every song and every album is a whole new journey. Especially this album. From start to finish it's everything from a late night drive up the coast, to Mardi Gras, to a morning hangover. But in a good way (hard to imagine, I understand, but give this a listen and you'll see).

In conclusion, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to rediscover this album in a new audiophile format, or anyone who is looking for a true 5.1 experience. I will say this album can no longer be used as background noise or a casual everyday spin. This album must be fully experienced by just sitting down, turning it up, and listening. Just listening. That is the 5.1 experience.",1388707200,2,3569,4.305059523809524
8610419,5,B00EYQ0K0G,"The Stereo version of How Does Your Garden Grow was the first Better Than Ezra album I bought, back in 1998. They had just played ""At The Stars"" on Conan, and I thought it might be worth taking a listen to the rest of the album. That disc didn't leave my CD player for months, and I became fascinated with the nocturnal themes of the album, the electronic noises mixed in with rock guitar, the swelling strings and amazing drumming. It was like nothing I'd ever heard before, and it made me an instant fan. Since then, I've seen them in concert 3 times, and even have a few signed copies of later albums. So, there seem to be a number of people finding this album and hearing it for the first time because they are interesting in hearing a 5.1 audio DVD, and then there's those of us who are fanatics about the album and want to hear it re-imagined. I think this album will make both camps very happy.

I actually didn't have a 5.1 system when I ordered the album, and had to buy and borrow some gear to make the listening happen. I'm sure what I have isn't as capable as what some other folks have in their listening rooms, but it was enough to make the first listening a really special event. The first track, somewhat of an overture, sets the tone for the rest of the album. Sweet flutes mix with electronic effects and distorted voices to set the tone up front as the album descends the listener into dusk. I was very pleased to find that the surround effects weren't gimmicky or surround-for-the-sake-of-surround, but helped to add dimension and fullness to the tracks. A few of the string sections seemed to stay in the mix longer than the original album, and electronic beeps and blips sound more defined, coming out of the rear channels. My absolute favorite tracks have always been Live Again and Particle. These are tricky songs, but they absolutely pulled it off. Particle remains just as dark and mysterious as I remember, but the ending becomes even more dramatic, with stronger string jabs and fuller drums. It's easy to tell that the minds at Music Valet love this album and wanted to do the best possible job with it.

Suffice to say, if Music Valet can handle an album this complex and rich, and keep an Ezralite happy, they're worth keeping in the loop for future releases. I kind of hope it's an album that I already love, but at the same time, I can see how it'd be fun to hear something brand new in this format as well. Either way, keep 'em coming.",1382486400,2,2470,4.426373626373627
