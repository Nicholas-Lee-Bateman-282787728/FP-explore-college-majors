4472661,4,B004UXVCYG,This was a great soap opera. The stories where a little short and fast but if you get the entire series and watch it from beginning to end it is a great Weekend watch. lol  I am so upset that they have canceled the show.,1320624000,,220,3.888888888888889

4472663,5,B004UXVCYG,"Just when the previous episode gave me doubts about the show and whether or not it was worth watching this reaffirmed it. This episode really lets you into Christina's past and helps you understand her life a bit better than you do already. The end of the episode was a little surprising, but I'm sure will sort itself out in the episodes coming",1312761600,,345,4.492063492063492
4472664,5,B004UXVCYG,"I thought this was a good episode for the beginning of the season. I won't say what happened so I don't spoil it, but it was a very sad episode and I don't get easily upset by tv and movies. The acting was great and they really conveyed how upsetting the entire incident was",1312761600,,274,4.092592592592593
4472665,1,B004UXVCYG,"I really hate this episode... After everything that's happened she sleeps with Nick who is the sleaziest ever guy on this show. I thought the show was looking up until this happened, I feel greatly disappointed by this episode",1312761600,7,226,4.82051282051282
4472666,4,B004UXVCYG,"I liked this episode quite a bit, however I really wish Hawthorne would get her job back I feel like the show isn't quite the same this way",1312761600,,139,4.0
4472667,5,B004UXVCYG,"The first season of Hawthorne was ""blah"" for me.  It did not pique my interest at all.  In fact, it was so blah that I did not watch the second season until this past weekend.  I am finally on the third and I am happy with its progression.  It actually looks like it has found its direction.",1312070400,,291,4.052631578947368
4472668,1,B004UXVCYG,"The first two seasons of Hawthorne were pretty good. I think it was probably one of the better medical dramas on television. Yeah, a lot of it was totally predictable and inaccurate but that is 95% of television shows. I liked how it was both comical and serious. I don't watch a lot of t.v., but I actually liked Hawthorne.

The third season is a train wreck. It's like the writers forgot the entire premise of the show and turned it into a very, very bad soap opera. I don't want to spoil it for those who would want to waste there time watching it, but it takes a dramatically different direction. The show now revolves entirely around Christina's personal life and I don't think there were any patient stories this entire season. Hawthorne has so many interesting characters and could have done a lot with them but didn't - at all. Everyone seems out of character, there are too many odd religious references, every episode is totally disjointed and slow, the story lines make no sense at all. Some of the characters who were in the first two seasons disappear off the face of the earth with absolutely no explanation. It's like a seven-year-old wrote the plot for the third season. I know, I probably shouldn't be insulting seven-year-old's.",1312070400,18,1246,4.663636363636364
4472669,5,B004UXVCYG,"I too would like to say that this is an well written cast. There's not one thing I don't like about this show. The new season starts off very exciting for Christina's family. Then tragedy strikes. That's when her and Tom's relationship/new marriage will start to hit a bumpy road. What will they do? Now that Christina has lost there child and may have lost her job, which u and I know that it's not going to last when it comes to the job. Everyone knows she's the heart of that entire staff. Will she stand the test of life and let Tom help her to deal with what has happened to the both of them and bring them both much more closer or break them up?I say it's way to soon in the new season to predict what's going to happen. This episode for me was the worst episode I've seen sense the very beginning. I believe this was a hate crime against this character because of who she is and who shes with,but I could be wrong. So that being said stay tuned for the next episode of HAWTHORNE.",1308182400,,986,4.167539267015707
4472670,5,B004UXVCYG,"This is a well written and well acted series.  This is the beginning of the third season and sometimes that's the point in which a series starts to get stale.  Not so with this particular series.  This episode re-introduces you to Nick Renata, who was a recurring role last season.  He is obviously still in love with Christina, but willing to step aside for her happiness.

This episode is fraught with love, friendships, danger, and on the edge of your seat drama.  Don't miss this innovative and thrilling drama.",1308096000,2,515,4.730337078651686
4472771,2,B004UXVCYG,"I LOVED seasons 1 & 2 of this show, and actually the first couple episodes of season 3 weren't too bad either, but everything went downhill from there...I understand that this show is a drama, but Jada Pinkett Smith herself called the show as dramedy. This is VERY evident in the first two seasons, but falls flat in season 3. I think it fell apart when they brought Marc Anthony in. I HATED his character of Nick.

*SPOILER* Not only did he ruin the relation of Tom and Christina, but he was an unnecessary addition. Sure bring him in to take care of the kidnapping of Isabel's baby, but then get rid of him!!! Besides that there were a lot of characters that just disappeared and then only have sporadic appearances (ie: Ray and Candy) I think this season would have been much better and more well received by viewers if the characters that they loved were the ones that the story was written for instead of bringing in new characters that were not needed such as Nick. It just wasn't as good as the first 2 seasons.

I also wish they would have dealt with Christina's attack in a more appropriate way and had Tom and Christina work through it together. There is only one time that I can recall that it is even brought up when they are talking that Tom says I lost a baby too. I just HATED they way they dealt with that situation. I know that most of the problem unfortunately falls on the mother when a baby is lost in the way that is was as with this situation, but the father is losing a child too. Tom did everything he could for Christina and THEIR baby and then I felt like for pretty much the rest of the season it just got ignored that he was even there and dealing with it as well.",1421366400,,1692,4.251552795031056

4472776,2,B004UXVCYG,"I did not like Season 3 as much as I liked Season's 1 and 2. I wish it had gone on to Season 4, as Hawthorne's character was just coming into her own and facing her relationship issues. I do recommend as it is very well acted and it is entertaining.",1412121600,2,249,3.9019607843137254

4472779,3,B004UXVCYG,The first 2 seasons were quite good and fun to watch.  The third season was violent and psychological and not nearly as good.,1410393600,2,125,4.434782608695652

4472851,1,B004UXVCYG,How did the daughter get from being 14 in the first season to a 20 yr old panting after a married man. Very low morality all around on this season!,1408752000,2,147,3.933333333333333

4472855,5,B004UXVCYG,Was very disappointed to hear there will not be another season.  Did enjoy the first 2 seasons a little more than the 3rd but hate to be kept hanging.  Thought it was very well casted.  Seems like the good series are the ones that are cancelled.,1403568000,,245,4.282608695652174

4472859,5,B004UXVCYG,"I loved the series and was extremely sorry to see it go by the wayside. Not sure why, there was plenty of possible story plots and lines to go forward.",1395705600,,151,4.066666666666666
4472860,5,B004UXVCYG,I love the Hawthorne series.. I am sorry that it ended with season 3.  The actors and actresses were superb.  Jada Pinkett Smith was superb.  I am sorry that she is not more active in her profession.,1395446400,,199,4.324324324324325
4472941,3,B004UXVCYG,I didn't understand the writing. It went in a completely dfiferent direction from the show and characters we grew to know and love. I didn't like the new roles the characters had. Christina went from a strong nurse to a weak confused woman who messes up everything she worked for. Not surprised it didn't make it.,1395273600,2,313,4.607142857142857
4472942,5,B004UXVCYG,Great medical series. Good characters and this season more than the others had me staying up until 4 a.m. just to watch another episode. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!,1395273600,,199,4.555555555555555
4472943,2,B004UXVCYG,"This season was very ""dark"".  I should have stopped watching after season 2.  I loved the 1st two seasons and was disappointed with season 3!",1395014400,2,141,4.6
4472944,3,B004UXVCYG,"We were disappointed in the 3rd season.  It really went downhill in storylines and character development.  Some of it so off-the-wall it had us squirming.  But we stuck it out just to see what would be the final outcome with some bizarre plots.  The first two seasons were so much better.  Very realistic, and characters we loved to empathize with.  In Season 3 there was nothing we could identify with.  I suggest just sticking to the first 2 seasons, and make up your own ending.  It will leave you with a better taste in your mouth.",1393372800,3,535,4.5
4472945,5,B004UXVCYG,I choose this rating because it held my interests. I could not wait for the next episode to start. I disliked that there were no more episodes to watch. I wanted it to go on I felt like I was left hanging.,1393372800,,205,3.9047619047619047
4472946,4,B004UXVCYG,I couldn't believe they cancelled this season when it had to be one of the best seasons of the show. I think they honestly had it out for this show to begin with. There was a great chemistry between all of the characters and it was sad to have it not return.,1393027200,,258,3.980769230769231
4472947,2,B004UXVCYG,Christina's character portrays someone strong who doesn't give up! She knows what she wants and fights for it! She could have saved her marriage w/o the drama! She's a fighter yet at the end of the day would like to be taken care of......but falling in love with a practical stranger after a hot night of sex ....once again doesn't fit her character! Just disappointed Christina's character has become this unstable floozy,1392940800,2,422,4.875
4472948,4,B004UXVCYG,"You bring couples together then have them cheat on each other. These affairs in the closet are not necessary. What about a real couple that has ups and downs not affairs.

4472949,5,B004UXVCYG,I Best television show in a long time I was stuck to the edge my seat awesome fanastastic great lovely,1391990400,,102,4.15
4472950,3,B004UXVCYG,"I can'y say much more for it. It is moderately entertaining, but that is about it. As a nurse it is nice to see a marginally more realistic portrayal of how a hospital works in regards to doctors/nurses, but it has little else going for it. Hawthorne's character is too obviously a tool of the story and it is hard to actually care about anyone in it.",1390867200,,351,4.253731343283582
4473011,2,B004UXVCYG,"This show starts out based in reality of the daily situations in a hospital and a CNO's personal life.  However, it quickly degrades to an incredible, almost fantastical storyline that is way too far fetched.",1390176000,,208,4.942857142857143
4473012,4,B004UXVCYG,"I enjoyed the season but didn't I like some of the parts. Extra material affairs is not my cup of tea. Can't wait till Season four comes out on Prime so I can watch it for free,",1389312000,,177,3.810810810810811
4473013,2,B004UXVCYG,"I am not sure WHY the third season took the route it did, but sorry it was horrible. Season one and two had so much potential!",1389312000,2,126,3.8846153846153846
4473014,2,B004UXVCYG,"I was disappointed with season 3. I hated the way Bobby became power hungry. I hated her whole demeanor. And Morrissey firing christina right after she was attacked for nothing. Tom was so distant. They both christina and Tom made mistakes. Neither talked after tragedy of what other was thinking and feeling. Christina should have parked closer. Had her keys in hand before she stepped out of hospital.someone or Tom should've walked her to her car. She should've been more observant of her surroundings. Morrissey should've had that garage with cameras and lighting. If Richmond trinity never closed. Her attack would have never happened. Nick couldn't wait to he'll himself to christina. Knowing she is married, knowing she I s grieving he helped himself then got nerve to get depressed and upset cause he wasn't chosen",1387411200,,822,5.051470588235294
4473015,4,B004UXVCYG,Loved it!!!  Jada is so passionate about her work in this show..I wish more people in the medical field shared her enthusiasm.,1386547200,,126,4.7272727272727275

4473018,5,B004UXVCYG,I hadn't seen many of the stars in this series perform in other settings but the cast did an outstanding job.  The show was full of drama and suspense.  Very well put together.  I hated to see the show go off after Season 3.  Perhaps they could come back with an Internet Series or something.,1382140800,,292,4.254545454545455
4473019,5,B004UXVCYG,I enjoyed this show and would like to know if there are any more seasons and if so will they ever be on Amazon.,1381708800,,111,3.6666666666666665

4473041,5,B004UXVCYG,"I completely love this show. I really recommend it to anyone who likes medical themes and
excellent love stories with a lot of drama too.",1379635200,,137,4.52
4473042,1,B004UXVCYG,"I agree with many other reviewers; this season turned into a soap opera and it just got worse and worse. Despite some good elements--I liked the soul searching and personal changes many characters faced; I liked learning more about Christina's past;  I liked the religious elements...ultimately I do not believe the level of drama the writers amped up into these characters. I believe Christina had more integrity and more capacity to deal with trauma than this season wrote her to have. The amping up element of the drama was not believable.

Also, the ABRUPT change in the story line about Camille's love life was insulting to me as a viewer. I'm not stupid. I know what happened in Season 2, so what is wrong with the writers that they couldn't spend five minutes explaining how she gets from point A in Season 2 to point B in Season 3? Give me a break. This was the most blatant example of poor writing I've seen in a show in a very long time. It makes me think there were some very bad choices being made behind the scenes that led to such a bad season overall. As a viewer, I am genuinely appalled by the decision to defenestrate the verisimilitude of Camille's romantic storyline. Unlike the Defenestration of Prague, there was no soft landing for what they threw out the window here!--just a completely unnecessary jettisoning of continuity and believability that got worse, and worse, and worse as the season progressed.

SOAP OPERA plot aspects SPOILER ALERT: The season had plenty of drama just from the first episode, but amping it up with more violence, infidelity, divorce, and murder made it into a different show than the show I was watching in Seasons 1 and 2. I agree with another reviewer: better to think of this as a two-season show. I tried to go along with this season, but honestly, the final episode was the nail in the coffin. If I wanted to watch a soap opera, I would watch one. I watched HawthoRNe in Seasons 1 and 2 because it was intelligent and powerful, full of complex characters who made difficult decisions with integrity and sometimes made mistakes...what I got in Season 3 was all the characters I've grown to admire turned into murderers, adulterers, alcoholics, etc. That was just too far of a stretch.",1379462400,9,2242,4.670886075949367
4473043,3,B004UXVCYG,The story pulled away from the seriousness of working in an environment that created exciting drama for all types of people in that community. It took away the story of one women's fight to help those in need against the big guys view of running a business.,1378252800,2,257,4.48936170212766
4473044,1,B004UXVCYG,"Season 1 was great! Season 2 was okay. Season 3 was terrible. The series started going downhill when it became less about the medicine and more about the drama. I mean, it's okay for a medical DRAMA to have some focus on the lives of the characters, but when the a medical drama becomes more about the characters' drama and affairs, instead of about the medicine and the patients, it's time to cancel it. I guess that's why there were only three seasons. Very disappointing.",1377734400,4,474,4.588235294117647

4473154,4,B004UXVCYG,"Not A Perfect Season (Especially since they cancelled the show... and left the audience hanging...)

I love that the writers took a chance to show ""the human side"" of Christina.. Someone who has dealt with everything this character has dealt with - was bound to ""Crack"" - which caused her to do things that the audience wasn't accustomed to.

We are human - We all have flaws..

Some of the storylines this season were flat - but my Tuesday Nights hasn't been the same since they took HawthoRNe off the air.

I wish the show was given an opportunity to grow or at least tie up the loose ends.",1346112000,4,592,4.4036697247706424

4473157,5,B004UXVCYG,I anxiously awaited Season three and was very disapointed to learn they would not be returning for Season four.  What happened?  That was one of my favorate  programs.,1335830400,,167,4.892857142857143
4473158,1,B004UXVCYG,"Sigh! What do I say. I really enjoyed seasons one and two. Waiting for season three to be released (I do not watch television) I couldn't understand why anyone would cancel a really good bit of work. Having watched season three, now I understand. What was focused on patients, hospitals and those that work there has suddenly switched to a much darker introspective detailing of a few focal characters with the hospital and patients mere, largely ignored, backdrop for some extremely depressing character assassinations.

Nurse Hawthorne is badly injured and looses her baby. The trained health professionals surrounding her react by firing her and confronting her, en masse, with HER faults! This highly inappropriate response is supposedly lead by a trained crisis councilor who, apparently, has never even met the victim. An excellent chance to educate folks about trauma, reactions to trauma, and appropriate behavior with the traumatized is, instead, used to heap additional trauma on the already dazed and bleeding victim.

They lost their direction and could not find their way back. Instead they kept making it worse. Perhaps it would be better thinking of HawthoRNe as having only two seasons. Sigh",1333584000,25,1207,5.248704663212435
4473159,5,B004UXVCYG,"This is my first time writing a review for something I purchased on Amazon, but I had to share how entertaining this season of HawthoRNe was to me.  I watched a few episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 but last summer I started watching the season and I was hooked.  It had all the elements I was looking for in a great series: romance, drama, action and suspense.  I love Jada Pickett and the supporting cast was amazing.  It is a great season and I purchased the other two to play catch up!",1333065600,2,483,4.161290322580645
4473160,4,B004UXVCYG,This was a great soap opera. The stories where a little short and fast but if you get the entire series and watch it from beginning to end it is a great Weekend watch. lol  I am so upset that they have canceled the show.,1320624000,,220,3.888888888888889
