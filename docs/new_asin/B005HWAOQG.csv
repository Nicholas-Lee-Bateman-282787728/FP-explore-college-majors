8473872,5,B005HWAOQG,A masterpiece. Fans of Wagner and collectors who love the beginnings of Cinema should have it. Better if you add instrumental Wagner music.,1428364800,,139,5.086956521739131
8473873,5,B005HWAOQG,"I love silent films...and British humor. They go hand-in-hand with this interesting bio-flick based upon the life of Richard Wagner.

 The film itself has no musical soundtrack. Instead we are treated to a delightful romp through the film with the voice of Tony Palmer. Since his WAGNER was mostly a dead-serious more than 7-hour film,  I expected a serious stiff-scripted narration by Mr. Palmer. Instead, he speaks throughout the film as though he were in the room with you. He pokes fun at the hairstyles and clothing as well as many of the situations the silent film attempts to seriously present. It is all in good fun and in good taste. Being a director, Palmer knows where too much is too much. I know, I know.

Along with the humor, Palmer adds some interesting facts to his narrative. A pleasant mixture of facts and humor. What better way to enjoy a silent film.

The print itself is surprisingly clear for 1913. I paused the film several times to view the settings in the background that were obviously carefully chosen for this bio. It helped having a big screen TV.
Giuseppe Becce looks so much like Wagner its frightening. It's also interesting to note that most of the the acting in this film isn't as exaggerated as in many films of that era. It's relaxed and realistic.

Every serious Wagner collector should have this in their collection. I know you've heard that before, but it should be remembered that many of the Wagner clan, including Cosima, were still alive and well when this film was released. Surely they were aware of it. It would have been interesting to get their take on it or if they had wanted it shown at all. It was also filmed to honor Richard Wagner's 100th birthday. Of interest are the views of Bayreuth and Wahnfried with Becce's Wagner standing before them.

Buy it and have a playful 80-minute romp through Wagnerdom...and a few chuckles along the way.",1407888000,2,1895,4.6897590361445785
8473874,4,B005HWAOQG,"Considering the vintage, this is a pretty good biopic.  It covers pretty much Wagner's entire life as it starts when he's a boy.  Some of the process shots are rather striking for 1913 and the technical quality of the film is excellent.  The recreations of scenes from a number of his operas (especially Rienzi) offer a glimpse how things were done in the old days.",1351814400,3,365,4.584615384615384
8473875,4,B005HWAOQG,"...because there is NO music track added to this 1913 film, The Life and Works of Richard Wagner! So at first viewing you'd best activate the Commentary track by Tony Palmer, the film director of Richard Burton in the mini-series ""Wagner"" (1983), and of ""The Wagner Family"" (2011). Well-spoken Palmer is humorous and adds information & trivia beyond the intertitle cards--there are no dialogue titles.

There are many stable camera setups, with fresh mini-scenes--some money was spent. Wagner is depicted from 8 years old (death of his step-father) to his lying in state in Venice, with his operatic characters gathered about him. He has been depicted as a user of others--Meyerbeer, Liszt, Wesendonck, Bulow, King Ludwig. He has fled repeatedly from his debts. He has been loved by Minna, Mathilde, Cosima. But the film is not melodramatic, more documentary in tone. So, without music, without some real oldtime ""acting,"" I wasn't thrilled, but I felt the cinematic techniques were pretty adventurous.",1336780800,8,1002,5.22360248447205
