This makes the films goal sound like a process focused film. However, the film's opening interview more accurately expresses that it's primary objective is civic & motivational; they want ""people to open their eyes to INCLUSIVE opportunities for everybody."" Artists in the film express that they want to be recognized for their Artistic ABILITY first, and their disability as just a part of who they are.

ARTS is an excellent film, and has wonderful potential for teaching tolerance and educating children and adults through the interviews of Artists with disabilities. It is a film that shares the success stories of individual Artists, so it is a motivational film with the capacity to encourage success in the arts for others. However, this film is very limited in it's exploration of actual applications in creative mediums. If you want to see the processes of how people with disabilities actually utilize art as a healing tool so you may help others utilize the arts, then this film will be limited in scope.

The statement that ""ARTS shows us HOW we can use the arts to improve social and life skills, language, cognition, physical and emotional well-being, and create potential career paths for those with special needs"" is an overstatement. It does not take you through a day in the life of the artists' PROCESS of utilizing an art to complete a project, but rather allows Artists an opportunity to verbalize their success stories, struggles, and offers snapshot segments of performances in the arts. If you want to see the complete process from beginning to end of an art project that includes the visual struggles and breakthroughs within art mediums while the artist is being interviewed along the way, then this film will be limited in scope.

This is not a method or instructional film. This is more a motivational film with success stories. It does not devalue the film, it is just clearer to make that distinction.

(On a side note): Personally, I found that the term our society created to recognize artwork created by Artists with disabilities and utilized in the film, ""Outsider Art,"" as words that defeat their goals of being recognized as an Artist first; it places them as an outsider first.",1312329600,4,2467,4.980582524271845

8394121,5,B003C6JZ7S,"This is an amazing film about self expression. It highlights the artwork - painting, drawing, writing, music, drama - of those with disabilities. It exposes art as a tool used to improve social and emotional skills in those who have disabilities. Not only does this highlight the ways in which art is helpful to those with disabilities but it also exposes the truly beautiful and skillful work that is created in the process. This film sheds light on the number of different possibilities that those with disabilities have to be successful with their art. The arts offer a great outlet for those with disabilities as well as offers them a boost to their self-esteem, self-awareness and self-worth. I enjoyed every aspect of this film, but the artwork/creative products were by far my favorite part. It really shed light on just how amazing anyone's work can be - whether they have a disability or not. Truly inspirational.",1271980800,6,922,4.916666666666667
