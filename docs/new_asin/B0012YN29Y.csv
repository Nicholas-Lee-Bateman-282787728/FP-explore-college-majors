3100238,1,B0012YN29Y,"Matthew Macfayden is an amazing actor. I love him in everything he does but this movie. It is a great story that doesn't really ""end"". The movie begins with a brief introduction then jumps 15 years to show you ""what happened"". Then it's just chaos..the end. that's that movie. there is absolutely NO time for character developement, no time for you to feel the characters, no nothing. I was left with the feeling of ""ok, what else. there's supposed to be MORE"" but there isn't. the movie stunk to be honest. skip entirely because you're not missing anything at all.",1271462400,5,565,4.66
3100239,2,B0012YN29Y,"The purchasing and delivery of this item was excellent; wasn't too crazy about the movie overall.  It was dark and somewhat disturbing, featuring religious people as way over zealous and a bit on the crazy side, as though Godly people can't just be normal people.",1252886400,,263,4.844444444444444
3100240,1,B0012YN29Y,Horrible movie. I bought it because I love Matthew Macfayden but I  found it to be dissappointing and boring. It was offensive in some parts. The story was really weak. Gave the movie away.,1218585600,4,189,4.5588235294117645

Not a monsters and ghosts kind of scary, but a human behavior scary. I would give it 5 stars, but I didn't think the characters were given enough time to develop.",1214697600,12,294,4.363636363636363

8248300,3,B0012YN29Y,"Middletown was a look at Muncie, Indiana, but through the lense of a white perspective.  I didn't expect much more because the filmakers and producers are white.  This series gives a very minimal look at life of what it was like to be black in Muncie.  I say this because of the last set in the series Seventeen.  The interracial dating experience was only seen through the main character Lynn's perspective(hillarious though, she's a player).  We really don't get any insight into her so called love interest John, and what he thinks of their interracial relationship.  The interracial theme was advertised heavily in the final movie Seventeen and I thought they would cover this topic with some balance, but they didn't. We don't hear from his parents, but we hear from Lynn's parents and friends.  Several topics in Seventeen were under examined, like the black basketball player Robert House having a baby in high school.  We don't get to know what his dreams or aspirations are, or any of the kids in this film white or black .  We don't get to know why it's an all white prom, or what the so called race riot is really about, its very cinema verite.  The only thing we really get to learn about many of the black people in the film is that either they smoke dope, drink, or like white girls and for the most part the white people are racist, smoke dope and drink. The so called good black people in Seventeen come off as house negroes!! The white people in this film are not portrayed any better but they get more time on screen to have they're say.  Overall I viewed this as a comedy, because it was funny as hell!!! From my perspective this movie (Seventeen)was more of a comedy than a social documentary on life in general in Muncie.",1357430400,3,1742,4.533546325878595
8248301,5,B0012YN29Y,"There is a creeping under current throughout these films. This glimpse into middle America is at once interesting and terrifying. If you at all enjoy documentaries make sure to pick this up. It is certainly the most ""widescreen"" view of a certain place in a certain time.",1354838400,,271,4.787234042553192
8248302,2,B0012YN29Y,I have almost everything Matthew Macfadyen has done. He is one of my favorite British actors. But this one I did not care for at all. I really enjoyed him I just didn't like the storyline.,1343347200,,188,4.25
8248303,5,B0012YN29Y,"My whole reason for ordering this documentary set was for the final, unseen episode ""Seventeen.""  And as other reviews have mentioned, it is an unflinching look at teenagers in Muncie, Indiana 30 years ago.  Does it cover ALL teenagers life in town?  No.  But just like looking back at your own high school years, you can see the moments you thought were big deals that likely were not...the events where you should have thought things through...and those that, out of context, are hilarious.

Now, that said, I was surprised to realize that my favorite in this set just might be Family Business, a film on a family owning and working at a pizza parlor.  Despite later finding out the director took some creative license (what you see in sequence didn't actually happen in sequence in reality) it is a gripping and honest film.

It's been mentioned before (and perhaps in the interview that is included in the DVD set - in Black and White for some bizarre reason) that the theme of all of these TV docs in Middletown is ""wanting.""  Men want to be mayor...players want to win and get on to play for a top college...a couple wants things it can't afford...a couple wants their youngest son to be as religious as they are...a family wants to either make a living or sell their restaurant...teens just want everyone off their back.

Icarus has presented these in relatively plain fashion.  That said, these films look as good as they could and there's no major flaws in the prints that likely weren't there before.  It would have been great to get a commentary track on these films from the directors to not only hear their stories from back in the day but if they kept in contact with those in the film.  (A booklet that comes with the set does give some ""where are they now"" info)

When my set arrived, the plastic part that was set in the spine of the case was broken, but the set played just fine.  Perhaps in the future Icarus could use the slim case to avoid shipping hazards, but why am I complaining?  They unearthed a rare TV series and finally gave it the audience it deserves.",1294012800,5,2083,4.532085561497326
8248304,5,B0012YN29Y,"There is something captured in these films that I think can never be replicated.  With so much reality TV around now, you can't bring a camera into a situation without people playing towards the camera or just not feeling relaxed and being themselves; people have learned how to act in front of the camera.  In this series, people are just being people and it is 20 times more interesting.  In every way this is the most accurate slice of life in America to date and still holds true today. Each segment is an interesting look into how this country works and how ""Seventeen"" never received more than just the award at Sundance I will never understand...",1285632000,9,653,4.612068965517241
