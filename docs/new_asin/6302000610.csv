408154,5,6302000610,"The Tom Baker era really gets into full swing with this, a claustrophobic and tense thriller which is also a parable of poisonous creatures invading human habitation after their own natural habitat has been destroyed by  humans.
Having accidentally arrived in a mysterious space station in the  future, the Doctor and his companions soon find the last of the human race  in cryogenic freezing.  But one of them is missing and something  other-worldly is glimpsed in the corridors.
This is without doubt a true  classic, filled with memorable scenes, including the suspence-filled  exploration of the base and the Doctor's well-written speech in the  cryogenic chamber.  If you're a fan of the series then watch this now - if  not, it'll convert you.",960163200,3,749,5.065573770491803

Baker's  performance avoids the overacting that mars many of his later adventures,  and he hits the perfect blend of alien and human. It also features Harry  and Sarah, one of the best companion combinations in the show's history.  Overall, a fantastic bit of Doctor Who, and one of the stories considered a  classic by the fans.

408308,5,6302000610,"This is such a great classic, essential Doctor Who and everyone knows it.
Tom Baker's Doctor was a brilliant synthesis of all others that had gone before and he got it right, he understood the character. Always affable and radically moral despite some biased scripting along the way.
The Fourth Doctor is one of my all time favorite aliens, truly timeless.
If time itself hadn't been so out of step with this good Doctor I think he would have stayed in vogue.

I like The Ark In Space because it is nature oriented, somewhat, like all my other favorite Who stories.
It reminds me of The Green Slime and Alien films.
Typical cheesy sets and SFX but there is a CGI update option for some scenes. Not necessary really.
Very decent performance from Wendy Williams, the character Vira.
Typical impressive quality release. Video is excellent. Audio has a bit too much white noise, fairly common.
A good number of extras including Who's Who, a short bio/filmography for the cast and some others. Useful and informative. It mentions Tom Baker's participation in The Silver Chair (The Chronicles Of Narnia). He portrayed Puddleglum the Marsh Wiggle, my favorite sourpuss!
I like the period short interview with Mr. Baker shot on a working location. Very humorous!

Wonderful fun.

Tom Baker had already ""seized"" the role in Robot and this episode further solidified his hold on the role as he would become the greatest Doctor of the original series.

Great writing and great production gave this episode a hook that is unforgettable. It's one of the top ten or twelve of Tom Baker's career. Materializing on a space station the Doctor and his companions discover that there is something amiss. Barely surviving zero oxygen, they discover that the station has been sabotaged by Wirrin, a Wasp-like species that seek to ""absorb"" the humans. Along with Vira, Lysset, Libri and Rogin, the Doctor and his companions do their best to thwart the evil aliens. Eventually with a bit of technical knowhow and

I loved this episode and I highly recommend it. The next episode called: The Sontaran Experiment is an indirect continuation of the events seen in The Ark In Space. Buy this and you won't be disappointed. I'm the 119th to give this story a Five star Rating and the 161st overall to review it.

408386,4,6302000610,"The Ark in Space was one of the first experiences to classic Doctor Who after watching all of the recent Doctor Who seasons (2005-now). I must admit that I never thought I'd like this as much as I had, but this totally blew away any expectations I already had about Doctor Who. The first episode felt a little slow to my modern brain, but when I went back to rewatch it I completely understand and love how it set everything up. Upon my first watch I couldn't believe how good each episode got, and built upon the previous one, to the point that I was addicted. The quality may not be up to snuff by today's standards, but the passion, imagination, and pureness that was put into this story was so strong that I now love classic Doctor Who over what's been playing for the last few years.

I'd say that this is a pretty good starting point if your introduction to Doctor Who have been the recent Doctors (9-12) and it'll make you curious about what other sci-fi goodness is in these past eras. The special features on this story is definitely a main point of why fans should buy this. I loved the commentary and the insight on what these actors thought at the time, and how they reflect on this particular episode after so many others.

408392,3,6302000610,"The Ark In Space tends to suffer a little more than some of the other Tom Baker Who adventures. It's not because of the trappings. All the Dr. Who serials up until the end of Peter Davison's run suffered from shaky sets, studio limitations, and the fact that the writers' imagination had been stretched for decades and was now in a bit of a rerun.

That's really where The Ark In Space suffers. Aside from Baker trying to find his footing in this new role-- Play it always for laughs? Tone it down severely? -- the script found new producer Phillip Hinchcliffe straining to bust out but not being fully able to do so yet. (That would come with ""Genesis of the Daleks"" which is frequently considered one of the best of any Who season.) The scenery was shared with the episode ""Revenge of the Cybermen,"" amortized across the budgets of two serials to get a better space station set they wouldn't have ordinarily been able to afford. It still looks pretty rough.

So does this DVD. A bare-bones edition with only two interview segments and not much else, the purchaser is duly warned. There are better ""special edition"" versions of this story on DVD, but the Amazon descriptions are so generic across the run, it is hard to tell which version is which. You spin the wheel and try your luck.

Now, in almost stark contradiction to what I just said, this story has several plusses to commend it. The most ""blah"" Baker stories are often still a lot of fun. The rapport between this Doctor and companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan is a lot more jovial than some previously in the run. For Who fans, while this is not one of the most essential stories (Genesis, Talons of Weng Chiang, City of Death, you get my drift), it's still worth the cost. Just make sure you're certain of the version you're purchasing.",1458345600,4,1811,4.549079754601227

408503,5,6302000610,"The first time I saw Ark in Space was at midnight on Public Television, so I vaguely remember the giant insect on the floor of the gleaming white spacecraft.  This has an elegant plot and is eerie.  In the distant future a group of humans decide to cryogenically freeze themselves and travel to ... well, I don't remember.  They are the best of the best and have the knowledge to rebuild their civilization.  One of them gets taken over by a large insect and then proceeds to damage the spacecraft and have lots of baby insects.  Then Dr. Who, Sarah, and Harry arrive to save the day before the insects can take over the other 20,000 humans.

Anyway, the two leaders of the ship are male and female and they intend to have children with each other to start the new civilization.  So, when the man gets changed into a giant insect, it's kind of like a tragic love story, Dr. Who-style.  If your true love turns into an insect, the relationship is really doomed.  But in the end, his love for her triumphs over his insect-nature and he blows up all of the insects.

The green bubble wrap used to depict the insect larvae was just corny enough to offset how scary it would be to be chased by a giant slimy maggot.

408558,4,6302000610,"Tom Baker (the 'Force of Nature') is aided by Harry and Sarah Jane to fight alien insects on a hybernation vessel orbiting the earth for 5,000, er... 10,000 years after a large solar flare incident destroyed the earth's human population.

This episode, one of the early Baker ones, is suspenseful enough, and (until the end) well-written.  This early story begins defining Baker's character in the future.  Although I prefer later Baker efforts, this one is probably the better introductory one, and Baker's character only gets better in later episodes.  Sladen, always great with Baker, sometimes outacting him, is quite wonderful.  I could nearly do without Harry, myself, in several scenes.

My children and I just didn't care for the silly ending, which seemed rushed and goofy.  I'm not going to spoil, but Dr. Who would have had strong reservations doing what he does.  Add to that the idea that the insects themselves could not figure out, even though their minds melded with highly intelligent humans!

Anyway, pretty good overall.  4 of 5 Amazon stars.  Nice added features, including commentaries.  Oh, the fun with bubblewrap!",1425427200,,1137,5.119565217391305

408560,5,6302000610,"This was Tom Baker's second story following his introduction in the rather mediocre 'Robot'. Where 'Robot' felt safe and nostalgic (the Doctor faced an Earth-bound danger surrounded by his old chums at UNIT) 'The Ark in Space' is claustrophobic and unnerving, stranding the Doctor far in the future, cutting him off from one of his dearest friends and forcing him to explore a silent, seemingly empty space station where SOMETHING is lurking...
This is a great story. Tom Baker steps into the role of the Doctor with full confidence, portraying the Time Lord as a fascinating, alien and unpredictable being. The guest monsters, The Wirrn, are unpleasant and well conceived creatures. Companions Sarah Jane and Harry are ably performed and a lot of fun. Watch 'Robot' if you want to be a completist, but really it's 'The Ark in Space' where we really met the 4th Doctor.",1423958400,,869,4.918367346938775

408639,4,6302000610,"Harry Sullivan was invited inside the TARDIS by the Doctor at the end of the story ""Robot"" and ""The Ark in Space"" is the first story that features the Doctor, Sarah Jane, and Harry together outside of Earth. Instead of going to the moon as planned, the trio arrives to find themselves aboard what they later discover is a space station called Nerva. It turns out that Nerva is an ark filled with cryogenically preserved plants and animals to repopulate Earth. However, something has boarded the station and messed with many of the internal functions, including the internal clock that was to begin awakening the crew. As the crew begins to awake, the Doctor realizes that the ship has been invaded by a giant insect-like creature called the Wirrn. The creatures can multiply by infecting other living creatures. The infection causes the infected to turn into Wirrn and all of their knowledge, thoughts, and feelings becomes one with the hive mind (kind of like the Borg in Star Trek). With a space station filled with sleeping victims/hosts, it's up to the Doctor to figure out a plan to save Nerva and her passengers.

""The Ark in Space"" is a four-part story. It originally aired in January 1975. The episode isn't as strong as some of the later Doctor Who episodes featuring the 4th Doctor. However, ""The Ark in Space"" makes clear that this incarnation of the Doctor is one who is quite different from the ones we have seen before. For instance, he tests gravity and other things by using a yo-yo and it is shown that the scarf he wears isn't solely for decoration and fashion.

I found ""The Ark in Space"" to be an enjoyable episode of Doctor Who. It's the only episode that features the Wirrn (other than a cameo in the episode ""The Stones of Blood""). Some of the effects look rather cheesy now (bubble wrap was used for much of the alien transformation cosmetics), but for a child the Wirrn are utterly terrifying. I mean, they are giant insects that can cause a human being to mutate into a Wirrn just by touching them! In terms of story, ""The Ark in Space"" holds up rather well. Watching the episode as an adult proved satisfying (and not as frightening as watching it as a child). Space Station Nerva became the thread that tied together the various stories in the season of Doctor Who. With the revived Doctor Who going very strong, it would be interesting to see if Nerva or the Wirrn ever made an appearance again because both are devices worth visiting again.

Horror of Fang Rock is an atmospheric, classic. Suitably creepy and fun. It's also the only episode currently available through Amazon Streaming.

Invisible Enemy introduces K9 but is mostly forgettable.

Image of the Fendahl is another atmospheric pseudo-Hammer Horror story in contemporary (1970's) Britain.

Sun Makers is a nice attempt at political commentary, criticizing tax rates.

Underworld is a horrible mashup of Greek myth, sci fi, and some of the worst green screen work ever. Though, to be fair it was a new technology then.

Invasion of Time rounds out the season with another classic, Gallifrey itself invaded by the Sontarans. Perhaps a bit long but manages to keep up the epic season finale feel.

409008,3,6302000610,"I believe this was Tom Bakers second full episode of the Doctor.  He was in the episode before The Ark in Space called Robot, in which he reincarnated from the old Doctor Jon Pertwee.
  Viewing this episode you can see Tom Baker has not developed the persona of the character that his portrayal of the Doctor would later become known for.  Still the elements are all there.  The story is imaginative; about an insect race of aliens that creep into the suspended animation chambers of a sleeping crew of earthlings that have left the earth long ago, and are on their long journey to a far off planet to re-establish the human-race via previously paired off individual mates aboard the ship.
  The alien race known as the;Wirrn enter into the suspended animation chambers, and gestate inside the Beacon's leader Noah The plan of this alien race is to take over the bodies of all of the sleeping crew members until the Dr. and Sarah show up to give the Beacon's crew a hand.  This was a nice little story. but it was a little too short and finished up rather quickly.

I do disagree with the other guys' low rating only because of his reasoning. I'd give the BBC release schedule lower stars as well but it shouldn't reflect on this adventure.  As a side note, I'm hoping, praying that part of the reason for the massive delay in releasing Terror of the Zygons is because they'll hopefully redo the Saracen monster in CGI. They really should.

As for the special editions, I usually don't get them because they don't add much for me except a few extra features. Any other additions are not worth it to me.  I'd recommend finding the original DVD and getting that, which I'm sure will be cheaper.",1361318400,7,835,4.777777777777778

409011,4,6302000610,"For so many Original Series Doctor Who enthusiasts, Tom Baker, (The Fourth Doctor), was *The* definitive Doctor Who. While he was indeed my favorite as well, I do still very much enjoy the other Doctors. But Baker episodes such as this one just seem to have been put together much better than those for earlier and subsequent Doctors.

This story features Sarah and Harry as sidekicks. The set design was created by Roger Murray-Leach, (for me, the top program set designer of the entire Series), and the music was composed and conducted by the indefatigable Dudley Simpson, the most renowned Doctor Who Composer of those great days. As for this particular set, it was used quite unashamedly in yet another period Doctor Who story,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Revenge-of-the-Cybermen-Story-79/dp/B001Q9ECM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Revenge of the Cybermen (Story 79)</a>&nbsp;so that the cost could be amortized over the two programs, (as budget was always an impending burden for the BBC producers.) And this was a Philip Hinchcliffe production, one of the best Producers of the entire Series, in my opinion.

THE STORY: The Tardis lands on a space station which houses super-intelligent Earthlings who escaped the planet before the population was obliterated. These people were held in suspended animation for centuries, hopefully to be restored to return to Earth once the planet's environment had recovered. The problem is that a nasty faction of space aliens, who resemble giant wasps, (and wasp larvae), have landed on the space station in the interim and they planned to use the humans for feed. It basically becomes The Doctor's problem to: 1. convince these people that they have been infested by these aliens, and, 2. defeat the aliens, hopefully with the help of the space station crew members which have been awakened... but their leader is taken over by one of the aliens which throws a monkey wrench into the works.

It's a great story, if not all that original, (it was written by Robert Holmes, one of the top-ever Series pens), and will certainly hold any fan's interest. Let's face it - about ninety-nine percent of the people who watch Original Series Doctor Who DVDs are enthusiasts from back in the day, (much as *Trekkies* are for their original series), as the production standards fall well-below what the majority of younger folks nowadays would find of interest. This story is not so good as, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Pyramids-of-Mars-Story-82/dp/B0002F6BSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Pyramids of Mars (Story 82)</a>&nbsp;but it's certainly better than ones on a level with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Leisure-Hive-Story-110/dp/B0007VY47C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Leisure Hive (Story 110)</a>, (just to put the perspective into a larger context.)

409015,5,6302000610,"This review is for the 2002 Region 2 DVD release of ""The Ark in Space"", the first time it's been on DVD.

At the end of the Doctor's adventure in ""Robot"" (Tom Baker's 1st serial as the Doctor), the Doctor invites UNIT medical officer Harry Sullivan inside the TARDIS. At the beginning of ""The Ark in Space"" we see the result. The Doctor had meant to impress Harry with ""a short hop to the moon"", but Harry messed with the TARDIS Helmic regulator. So instead of the moon, the Doctor, Harry and Sarah Jane Smith find themselves on Nerva, an apparently deactivated space station orbiting Earth. The Doctor repairs the sabotaged life support system. Unfortunately that also reactivates the automatic guard, ceiling mounted lasers which attack any biological form. In a favorite sequence, the Doctor and Harry cleverly fool the guard, sacrificing Harry's shoes in the process. ""I think we've done it Harry. Pity about the scarf.""

To the Doctor's delight, they realize that Nerva is an ark. It has frozen animals and plants, as well as a wall of drawers containing microfilm with ""the entire body of human thought"". Then they find the cryogenically frozen humans, and the first, a female named Libri, awakes. She tells them that the ark was prepared 5,000 years before to repopulate earth after giant solar flares killed all life.

Unfortunately for Nerva's occupants, the Doctor has to tell Libri that ""A long time ago, when you were dormant, you had a visitor."" A giant insect-like creature has been found dead in a closet and something is making slime trails through the ship. Libri wakes two technicians, and Noah, the Commander. Noah is disgusted to find three regressives on board. ""Our genetic pool has been balanced, cross-matched.... Three random units can cancel our survival.""

The puzzles mount. The Doctor discovers a green creature growing in the main solar stack. Libri discovers that one of the human pallets is empty. Mistrusting the Doctor, Noah stuns him and heads down to check the solar stack for himself. The green thing, we find out later that it is the grub stage of a Wirrn, is loose from the stack, and one of its slimy appendages touches Noah's hand.

The next we see, Noah is back with the others, holding our travelers at gunpoint, and mysteriously keeping his left hand in his pocket. Will any human or Gallifreyan get off Nerva alive?

""The Ark in Space"" is a four-parter that first aired in January, 1975. It is one fabulous show. It has pathos, action, horror, humor, psychology and a great science-fiction premise. And it has one of the best versions of a hero crawling through air ducts. Sarah Jane is egged on by the Doctor insulting her and it's actually funny, because you realize what he's doing.

Extras on the 2002 Region 2 DVD release:

1.  Audio Commentary. Commentators are Elizabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane), Tom Baker (the Doctor) and Philip Hinchcliff (producer). Sladen starts out saying, ""Of all my Dr. Who stories, this is the most difficult one for me to talk about"". She later gives reasons, such as that, with the addition of the character of Harry, she felt like she had nothing much to do, and sometimes was reduced to being the helpless female.
Hinchcliff says that he and writer Robert Harris were eager to get Dr. Who away from the invasion-of-earth stories that were a staple in the Pertwee years. Going to a space station was just what they wanted. However, the budgets weren't any bigger, so the set design had to be creative: ""Roger [Murray-Leach, designer] used mirrors very cleverly, so that, certain shots, you think you're looking down a big long corridor and seeing more chambers. When in fact, it's the same chamber in a mirror.""
Tom Baker says, of playing Dr. Who, ""It was the best part I ever had. I never had to reach.""
2.  ""New CGI Model Sequences"". You can watch the show with the original model effects for the outside space station shots. Or, you can watch it with new computer-generated effects.
3.  ""Unused Title Sequence"" (1 minute)
4.  ""Original Model Effects"" This is 7 minutes of shooting sequences and different takes for the model shots of the space station from the outside.
5.  Trailer for Episode 1, originally aired 1974
6.  Photo Gallery. In the commentary, it was noted that most publicity stills were taken at rehearsals, and the actors did't have full make-up.
7.  Who's Who. Eight biographies of key characters, including Stuart Fell, who played the worm/larvae Wirrn.
8.  ""Space Station Schematics"" (15 minutes) This shows plans and data on the space station, such as that were are ""2,000 double berths"" and ""two solar stacks with toroidal plasma stores"". Is 2,000 enough to repopulate Earth?
9.  Information Text. Richard Molesworth provides cast details, script development and other information related to the production of this story.
10. ""Howard Da Silva Intros"" (18 minutes) Starting in 1978, Time/Life distributed 98 half-hour episodes to North American TV stations. Da Silva introduced each episode, and closed each episode with a teaser. He narrated over clips.
11. TARDIS-cam (1 minute)
12. Interviews. There are two interviews:
A.) Roger Murray-Leach. (15 minutes, filmed in 2002) Murray-Leach is the designer for ""The Ark in Space"" and other Doctor Who serials. It's accompanied by photos. One photo shows the full-length mirror in place, giving the impression that you're looking into another room.
For the Wirrn in the larvae stage, they used a brand new material, that wasn't commonly known as bubble-wrap yet. The trouble was, when the larvae crawled along the floor, the bubbles started popping ""like static or machine gun fire"".
B.) Tom Baker. (7 minutes, filmed 1974) This was taken during location rehearsals for ""Revenge of the Cybermen"" at Wookey Hole. The interviewer notes that Tom is not wearing typical Dr. Who attire. Tom replies, ""I cannot really follow that very very sophisticated line that my predessor used."" I've read that Tom Baker and Jon Pertwee grated on each other, and this comment may show that.
13. Easter Eggs. There are three.
A.) Press up at Part One on the Episode Selection Menu. When the Dr Who logo turns green, press enter. You'll see a funny 16-second spot featuring Tom Baker promoting the Doctor Who Exhibition Blackpool.
B.) Let the credits for Episode 4 play to the end, and another goofy promotional spot for the exhibition runs.
B.) The 3rd Easter Egg is 30-second shot of a production clapperboard used for Part Two of The Ark in Space. Find this by pressing left at Photo Gallery on the Special Features menu. When a green Dr. Who logo appears, press enter.

ARK IN SPACE
Story # 76
Season 12's Second Story
Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker Era, First Season 1974
Seventh Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL RATING 10/10
ARK IN SPACE, is the second Fourth Doctor story to be broadcast and the first broadcast story to carry ""Producer Philip Hinchcliffe"" in the credits.  ARK IN SPACE is the very first ""WHO Masterpiece"" of the Tom Baker era. It is a story that holds up very well today, and likely numbers as many New Series fans as Classic Series fans among its admirers.  It is a favorite of New Series Producer Russell T. Davies, and its subtle character still influences many modern stories.

ARK IN SPACE marks a special time in WHO history, being a superb story, with Tom Baker so fresh and early in his run as the Fourth Doctor, bouncing so perfectly off Elisabeth Sladen and Ian Marter. The three together make what many fans consider WHO's finest TARDIS team whose adventures together are highly prized, as their 6-story-arc was much too short. Three of those 6-arc-stories, rate among the all-time finest WHO stories.  Doctor Who Magazine #413's ""Mighty 200 List"", a 2009 fan poll of greatest stories, lists ARK IN SPACE at #28, TERROR OF THE ZYGONS at #17, and GENESIS OF THE DALEKS at #3. The wonderful 6-story-arc ends as TERROR OF THE ZYGONS closes, with Harry, ""sticking to intercity"" leaving only Sarah to enter the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor. TERROR OF THE ZYGONS also marks the ""end of an era"" with the final screen appearance of the Brig, Benton & Co. UNIT team, a UNIT team that had existed since Season 6 in the Pat Troughton Second Doctor era.

ARK IN SPACE, being an early adventure in that extraordinary 6-story-arc, and a ""WHO Masterpiece"" to boot, is very, very special.

STORY & SCRIPT 10/10
In the DVD commentary, Philip Hinchcliffe mentions that the ARK IN SPACE script became a ""page-one-rewrite"" by Script Editor Robert Holmes.

While at the time this was undoubtably a thorn in the side of Bob Holmes, generations of WHO fans are thankful for the rewrite, as the sure hand and peerless skill of a master writer shows in every scene of ARK IN SPACE.  The story brims with wonderful character moments and memory-searing scenes: Harry's incinerated shoes as he and the Doctor battle the Auto Guard; the Doctor's great ""Homo Sapiens"" soliliquy; Noah's slow, chilling transformation into a Wirrn; the charming ""Sarah / Doctor"" moment as she alone thinks of the power available in the shuttle; Sarah pulling the power cable through the conduit; the Doctor goading Sarah stuck in the conduit; Vira slowly warming and becoming more human as the story progresses, to mention just a few.  A trait typical of Robert Holmes stories, there are many other equally memorable scenes, and each viewer will take away their own special moments from ARK IN SPACE.

Frame-by-frame, ARK IN SPACE becomes an unforgettable adventure with memorable scenes etching themselves into the viewer's mind.

ACTING 10/10
Flawless across the board, with every performance spot on. Part One, consisting of only the three regulars interacting as they explore the space station, beautifully illustrates the smooth, natural, effortless way Elisabeth Sladen, Ian Marter and Tom Baker work together, and the extraordinary TARDIS team the three make together.  The guest cast is exceptional and even the small roles of Libri( Christopher Masters) and Lycette (John Gregg) have impressive onscreen depth for such short appearances.  Kenton Moore as the Commander ""Noah"" impresses with the incredible range of emotions expressed, as he goes from cool, detached commander suspicious of the intruding TARDIS trio, to tormented soul desperately fighting being slowly absorbed by an alien life form, and it is a performance that cannot help but grab the audience.  Wendy Williams as ""Vira"" goes from a personality almost too distant for the TARDIS team to touch, to a warm positve presense who is almost another TARDIS team member!  Richardson Morgan's excellent ""Rogin"", complaining of ""Snitch-ups"" and wishing he'd remained on Earth so that he'd be ""comfortably dead by now"" gets the audience grinning and helps to liven the serious script with gallows humor.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 10/10
The impressive, creative and imaginative set design by Roger Murray-Leach is well photographed and utilized perfectly by Director Rodney Bennett. Elisabeth Sladen, in her Autobiography, explains that while Rodney Bennett was a very skilled director in handling and dealing with the minute technical details of a Sci-Fi production, he was not an ""actor's Director"" and that she, and other actors, often felt invisible on set.  With a cast as good as ARK IN SPACE has, this appears to have been a positive. A quality cast of experienced, stage-trained actors can bring characters and situations to life without having to be minutely directed, letting a good Director concentrate on the tiny technical details that will make a superior production onscreen.

In the ""ARK IN SPACE"" production era of Doctor Who, the stories were extensively rehearsed and fine-tuned in rehearsal rooms the week prior to actually filming the story on set. The actual filming was almost like a stage play with many video cameras simultaneously recording the on-set performances.  While modern ""rehearse, record"" TV production methods streamline and economize the process, the modern productions often suffer in comparison to the old ""Stage Play"" method of production.  The best stories of Classic WHO, have much depth and character, due to such extensive rehearsal and fine-tuning of a story and characters prior to recording.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 9/10
Excellent special effects; watching ARK IN SPACE with original effects and then watching a second time with the new CGI effects, has very little difference to the viewer, emphasizing just how good the original effects and model work was during this era in WHO history. The one problem area with special effects is that the Wirrn are too brightly lit, and the overlighting hurts Wirrn onscreen menace.  In the commentary Producer Philip Hinchcliffe expresses his dissatisfacton with the overlighting, but explains in detail why it was so difficult to get lighting levels down in the mid-70's BBC studios. As for the green-sprayed bubble wrap's special effects use in ARK IN SPACE, when imagination takes over, no attention is paid to bubble wrap effects as this wonderful story takes hold.  A little imagination will fade away less-than-stellar special effects or cartoonish CGI as a great story unfolds onscreen.

STORY IMPORTANCE 10/10
Is ARK IN SPACE an important WHO story? There are no universe-shaking revelations of Time Lord characteristics or corruption as in DEADLY ASSASSIN or WAR GAMES.  With a quick half-attention viewing, on the surface the story could be just an entertaining romp-in-future-space for the Doctor and his companions, and it would be easy to rate ARK IN SPACE as a bit above an average WHO story at ""6/10"" and leave it at that.  But, on close careful viewing, the exceptional story quality stands out marvellously, as the well scripted, produced, and performed story it really is.  Noticeably so, even in an era when high story quality had become the norm for the program under the guidance of preceding Producer and Script Editor Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks.

Under the guidance of newly arriving Producer Philip Hinchcliffe and Script Editor Robert Holmes, DOCTOR WHO would move on to achieve an international audience and reputation. And it was the mesmerizing early stories of the Hinchcliffe / Holmes era, exceptional quality stories like ARK IN SPACE, that first grabbed the attention of that international audience.  Given that consideration, ARK IN SPACE is at least as important to the program's success, as are the fan-attention-grabbing stories of Time Lord mythology and trivia, such as DEADLY ASSASSIN. In the very real world of ratings and attracting new audiences, ARK IN SPACE may have been even more important to the program's survival and success.

DVD EXTRAS 6/10
One of the earlist WHO DVD releases in 2002, the present ARK IN SPACE DVD does not have the wealth of extras common to the later releases.

Excellent and informative Text Commentary by Richard Molesworth

COMMENTARY Participants
Elisabeth Sladen, Tom Baker and Philip Hinchcliffe. An unmoderated commentary that is very good, as the three work very well together.

INTERVIEWS

Tom Baker interview from 1975 at the Wooky Hole location of REVENGE OF THE CYBERMEN.

Other DVD extras include new CGI model footage, and a 3D Ark schematic, original BBC trailers, Photo Gallery & etc.  Not bad extras, but what is missing is a documentary or two concerning the production of ARK IN SPACE.  Such extras did not become normal until several years after the 2002 release of the present ARK IN SPACE DVD.  No doubt this will be corrected in a future ""Special Editon"" release, especially for a story as important and highly regarded as ARK IN SPACE.",1354233600,,9203,5.084993359893758
409089,5,6302000610,"This is a review of the story, not the DVD.

""Ark in Space"" is a great story on all counts. The chemistry between Tom Baker and Liz Sladen positively sparkles -- they're obviously having a great time, and so the viewer does, as well. The scenes where the Doctor essentially calls Sarah Jane a sissy are hilarious -- he knows how to punch all her buttons to get her to be the brave and competent companion he knows she is.  Tight, tense, well-written and directed -- this is one of my all-time favorites.

""Aliens"", anyone?",1309219200,,522,4.473684210526316
409090,4,6302000610,"""Doctor Who: The Ark in Space"" was only the second serial that Tom Baker starred in, but his instant ease in the role shows why he was one of the best Doctor Whos ever. This serial has very hokey special effects, but the story is a pretty solid, straightforward sci-fi alien-invasion story.

The TARDIS randomly arrives on a space station in orbit of Earth, thanks to Harry fiddling around with the controls. And after Sarah is briefly put in suspended animation, the Doctor discovers that this station is called the Ark -- it's a sleeper station with the last remnants of the human race, since Earth has been rendered uninhabitable.

However, something sabotaged the station's power, leaving the suspended animation lasting for thousands of years longer than intended. Yeah, it's obvious what happened as soon as a giant bug falls out of a closet.

The Doctor soon discovers that there are more giant insects -- known as Wirrn -- infesting the ship, especially since one of them laid eggs in a now-dead crew-member. And the ship's commander is beginning to act strangely as an alien consciouness turns him into a giant mass of green bubble-wrap.

Yeah, the weakest part of this serial is the special effects, which are rather hokey even by old ""Dr. Who"" standards -- the giant dead Wirrn looks like somebody's science project. Buuuutttt... fortunately, that is the biggest problem this serial has.

One of the best parts is the depiction of the 29th-century humans -- cold, rigid, repressed, and apparently big fans of eugenics. Example: Noah immediate reviles the newcomers as ""regressives"" who could contaminate their perfect genetics. What, he thinks they're going to go on a mad babymaking spree?

But to the writers' credit, they don't get preachy on us. And despite the hokeyness of the Wirrn, there are some genuinely creepy moments as green ooze and larvae overcome the station's power systems.

And of course, there's Tom Baker. He was pretty new to the role, but gave this story a lot of intelligence as well as kooky humor (the scene where he verbally abuses Sarah as motivation). Elisabeth Sladen gives a nice solid performance, but Ian Marter is... well, he's just there to be an extra pair of hands.

""Doctor Who: The Ark in Space"" is a solid sci-fi adventure, and a lead performance that reminds us why Baker is still one of the favorite Doctors ever.",1307664000,,2367,4.856079404466501
409091,3,6302000610,"'The Ark in Space' is the first story that Philip Hinchcliffe produced. Among fans of the classic series, his three seasons are widely considered to be the best the series has ever been, and this story is no exception. For that reason, I highly recommend it. The caveat, however, is that this was one of the earliest Doctor Who stories released on DVD and as such the special features are very minimal especially compared to some of the more recently issued stories. For this reason 2|Entertain has been releasing a few of the earlier stories they put out in newer Special Editions with better picture and audio quality and a lot of additional extras on the discs. If you're the sort of person who enjoys that sort of thing, I highly recommend waiting for this to be reissued as the Special Edition has been announced as forthcoming (presumably sometime next year). If you don't care, though, you should pick this edition up, but as for me, I consider it a five-star story in a one-star release (that averages out to 2.5 stars for the package as a whole, but I rounded up to three since it's a story that you really should see at some point if you're a fan of the classic series).",1289001600,6,1180,4.518691588785047

This one was a scary one, but then again I loved being scared when I was a kid. Now years later, it's still kind of creepy to me. This one is kind of like an earlier and less scary version of ""Alien"".

The Doctor and his companions land on a seemingly deserted space station far in the future, and later learn that it is an ark in space carrying the last survivors of the human race after fleeing Earth when it was ravaged by solar flares. But something is seriously wrong. The station has been sabotaged, and some kind of alien life form is aboard, breeding fast, preparing to harvest the humans and conquer the newly rejuvenated Earth.

409178,5,6302000610,"Well, it may be pretty irrational on my part to rate ""The Ark in Space"" five whole stars when there are noticeable imperfections in this storyline. For instance, the conclusion in episode four is a bit hard to follow as well as bordering on implausible (once you realize what's supposed to be happening), and some rather dodgy moments here and there in the dialogue don't help things. But the strengths tend to outweigh the weaknesses in the final analysis, and getting to see Tom Baker as the Doctor again after all these years trumps the matter as far as I'm concerned. Not that he's got the role down completely yet, this being only his second go at it after ""Robot"" beforehand, but all the basic elements of his almost archetypal eccentricity are here in the making. Simply fabulous.

The story as a whole is very inventive and imaginative, too, with a healthy dash of suspense and mystery that gradually develops into horror. The idea of the Doctor and his two companions stumbling onto an ancient space station in Earth's far future, triggering its various defense mechanisms and whatnot until finally discovering the crew in cryogenic stasis (so as to outlast a global catastrophe and then repopulate the earth) sets the stage nicely, and then it becomes a matter of finding out what has gone wrong, i.e. why the station malfunctioned and didn't awaken them at the appointed time, why certain crew members are missing altogether, and what has been leaving some rather gross organic residue around and about. Sure enough it's bug-eyed monsters (the Wirrn), who bear humankind some enmity and in any case find comatose humans a convenient source of nourishment.

Yep, that's where things get pretty horrific, but that and the station leader's torturous transmogrification into one of the insectoids is by way of harsh contrast part and parcel of the story's overarching theme, the worth and dignity of individual humanity. Pretty much everything comes together and points to this in fact, obvious things of course like the Doctor's multiple paeans to his favorite species and the space station itself preserving that species and all of its history, culture, and accomplishments (on microfilm) against adversity. The latter complicates the theme, for most of the humans on the station whom the Doctor and company awaken are rather coldly utilitarian eugenicists, and fighting for survival alongside the main characters gradually (and convincingly) humanizes them--it could plausibly be argued that this in fact is the primary plotline. And to top it off, the two people who really save the day at the end are a misfit cynical engineer and the station leader himself whose awful metamorphosis ironically gets him in touch with the last shred of his humanity.

In short, a fine story and theme well-realized by fine acting and pacing plus one of the earliest examples of Tom Baker's fantastic take on the Doctor all make this a fine ""Doctor Who"" DVD overall.",1174003200,,2960,5.0

This episode is Tom Baker's first as a newly regenerated Doctor out in space and time operating without the safety net of U.N.I.T. with his companions in tow.

There is an unused title sequence that features the TARDIS against a black backdrop and then launching forward with different travel design.  There are two easter eggs.  One is of video of a clock with a voice counting down.  The other is this bizarre 2-3 second shot of Tom Baker announcing that he's running off to Blackpool and then telling us to brush our teeth.  There's a great Tom Baker interview that must have been done just after he took over as the Doctor.

409184,4,6302000610,"Classic ""Who"" serial has the fourth Doctor (Tom Baker), Sarah-Jane, & Harry, aboard the TARDIS, accidently landing on a space station orbiting Earth thousands of years into the future.

The station, called Nerva, is home to the last remains of the humanrace resting peacefully in hypersleep. Things turn grim when Sarah is accidently put into hypersleep & upon trying to revive her, Harry & The Doctor come across a large dead insect like creature. The Doctor recognizes the creature as part of the species known as The Wirnn, an insectoid race that goes across the universe destroying worlds and killing off all organic life by changing them into a member of the Wirnn hive, with all memory of its previous life wiped out. The Doctor also informs Harry that The Wirnn don't travel alone.

The Doctor revives Sarah and with the help of Harry also revives members of the station, warning them of the Wirnn threat. But its already too late. The leader of the humans has already been infected and with his last remains of humanity warns the rest of his crew to leave the ark in space or die. Its up to The Doctor to help save the humanrace and destroy The Wirnn invasion.

This was the first ""Doctor Who"" serial to be released in the U.S. in 1978 (I remember, living in Rhode Island at the time, that the CBS affiliate, channel 6, carried the show for one season airing it in the late afternoons with the PBS affiliate WCBH Channel 2 in Boston picking it up there after).

The Wirnn storyline is very similar to the film ""ALIEN"". The oddity here is that ""ALIEN"" was released four years after ""Ark in Space"" was first broadcast on the BBC, in early 1975 (""Jaws"" hadn't even been released yet!). Ridley Scott was rumored to have been in someway associated to ""Doctor Who"", but, either he refused to do the show or he accepted another offer (I think was to direct ""The Duelists"", I'm not sure).

Tom Baker is great as The Doctor and remains the definitive favorite among the seven Doctors (or is it eight?).

The effects are pretty cheesy. With the BBC having their studios devided into categories & film budgets kept to a minimum its a wonder that ""Doctor Who"" got filmed at all! (for example, the white corridor used in the show is a semi-circle corridor and is used throughout the show, but, is filmed at different angles to give the illusion of being in a different part of the ship).

The show was a huge hit in the U.K., usually landing in the ratings top 20 shows of the week.

As for the DVD specs, the complete serial in all four parts, 2.0 Dolby Digital w/ optional audio commentary with cast, an easter egg, TARDIS cam, an optional FX feature that can substitute the old FX with new CGI replacements (thats a cool feature), schematics of the Nerva space station, and a who's who cast listing.

The limited budgets l-o-n-g before the availability of CGI may lead to grin enducing special effects in comparison to what's created now, but this story itself proves to be more interesting and Tom Baker's perfomance more compelling than much of today's special effect rich but otherwise nearly void stuff.
How great was Star Wars, how much movie magic was created with a limited budget? How merely 'OK' was the Phantom Menace with scene after scene of special effect upon special effect upon special effect that left me pushed away rather than drawn into a story.
Script and performances over modern flash.
I will definitely be purchasing more Doctor Who even after the reminisence desire has been sated, because there are more entertaining storys to watch again.
My only holdback from 5 stars, and it deserves more than 4 stars, were the 'extras'. I appreciate entertaining extras; I dread the 'why'd they bother' extras, just to make it so much more worth buying. Buy this Dvd for the main story, don't expect much from the extras.",1105142400,3,1268,4.875

""The Ark in Space"" was a great story first of all. Tom Baker is excellent, and the supporting actors do a great job within this remarkable story. The DVD has some pretty cool extra features, with audio commentary from Tom Baker himself. Overall, this was one of the better 4-part episodes that Tom Baker performed in.

409261,4,6302000610,"I originally titled my review, ""Wouldn't earn a passing grade in film school"", and I thought I'd never watch this story again. When the DVD came out I decided to see how the new model shots and effects looked. I quickly forgot all about the new effects as I became absorbed in the story and the atmosphere. (And managed to ignore the green bubble wrap once I put it in its historic context - bubble wrap was still very new and unknown material in 1975, which the DVD pointed out.)

I've left my original review after this revision in case anyone wants to read it, but I've changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars, and would even go 4-1/2 if I could. (For some reason the new 4-star rating doesn't show up in my published review, but does in the edit. Must be a bug in Amazon's software.)

Fun story, well written, well-acted, and very good sets considering the budget and the era. Maybe after the next time I watch it I'll add another star.

--- ORIGINAL REVIEW (though I should probably delete it) ---

I've been a Doctor Who fan for about thirty years, and it's been nearly that long since I've seen this story. After reading the reviews, I ordered the tape and eagerly sat in front of the tube, ready for a great adventure. How disappointed I was! How painful to watch!

Come on, now -- spray-painted bubble wrap taking over a hammy actor playing Adam, the ""Prime Unit""? Doggie squeak toys for alien voices? Giant Mister Potatohead insects? Heck, even an actor's head becomes visible when the ""larvae"", obviously actors crawling around in green laundry bags, attack the control center. Even Elizabeth Sladen seemed uncomfortable trying to look afraid of the ""slugs"". Seems like the series took a big step back for a while in TB's early days.

The only reasons I give it two stars are (1) Tom Baker's performance, and (2) a decent script and story idea.

I'm still a fan of the series, but I won't keep this tape in my collection.",1093305600,2,1928,4.491428571428571

This is the story in which Tom Baker takes over to become THE Doctor, completing the transition from third to fourth Doctor.

I wonder if anyone noticed the thinly veiled allusion to Nazi ideals.  Noah would not hesitate to shoot the Doctor, Harry and Sarah so as not to risk contamination of the perfectly balance gene pool, thereby preserving the purity of the human race.  Doesn't this parallel Hitler's plan to create a master race?  The human race in the story has been neatly regimented, each individual performing his or her own task without concern for crossing the lines of his or her function. In the end, however, human individuality wins out, as it takes the nonconformist Rogin to sacrifice himself so the humans can survive.

409263,3,6302000610,"""Ark"" is ironically titled, as it begins an unusual ""story-arc"" of four episodes surrounding the Nerva space station. As is typical of this era of the show, all the episodes have strong horror themes and ""Ark in Space"" is no exception.

 In it, the Doc & Company land on a space station orbiting an uninhabited earth and filled with cryogenically frozen humans. Seems some pesky solar flares made the earth uninhabitable, and these people, representing a genetically perfect ""elite"" were chosen to wait out the storm, and then re-populate the now empty globe. They have two problems. One: they didn't wake up when they were supposed to. Two, while they were sleeping, they picked up a hitchhiker. A large, bug-eyed, green, slimy space hitchiker, looking for a comfy spot to lay its eggs. And nothing makes a comfy place for your evil space larvae than a sleeping human body. It doesn't take a genuis to see what will happen next:

 1) The Doc will helpfully awaken the crew.

 2) Instead of being grateful, the crew will suspect he is to blame for everything that is going wrong, and spend a great deal of time poking guns in his ribs and threatening him.

 3) Sarah will scream ""Doctor!"" a lot and open doors that have horrible monsters on the other side.

 4) Harry will nearly get everyone killed with his bumbling and fight with Sarah constantly, which on this G-rated show replaces the sexual tension you would normally expect with a two-man, one-woman cast.

 5) In the meantime, the space bugs will hatch, feed on the stupid, and generally make a mess of things until they are stopped....or stop themselves.

 ""Ark"" is a little slower-paced than other Who eps. from this era, which is why I gave it three rather than four stars (in fairness, it's about a 3.5), and as is often the case in ""Who"" episodes, the people the Doc is fighting to save are not really worth saving: the ""elite"" of earth's gene pool prove arrogant, cold-blooded, callous, and not too terribly skilled when it comes to staying alive. I wouldn't have minded it if the bugs had won.

 On the other hand, ""Ark"" has (by Who standards) some very impressive set designs to go along with the marvelously campy dialogue (""Take another step, Doctor, and I'll atomize you!"") and the creepy, ""Alein-esque"" concept of self-important humans ending up as nothing more than incubators/Gerber's baby food for a race of nomadic space bugs. As always, Tom Baker, Liz Sladen, and the underrated Ian Marter work well together, with Baker in the unwanted role of ""Dad"" to their squabbling sibilings.

 An enjoyable outing, but by no means the best of this particular trio.",1090281600,3,2630,4.755506607929515

409267,4,6302000610,"""Homo sapiens.  What an inventive, invincible species.  It's only a few million years since they crawled up out of the mud and learned to walk.  Puny, defenseless bipeds.  They've survived flood, famine, and plague.  They've survived cosmic wars and holocausts.  And now, here they are, out among the stars, waiting to begin a new life.  Ready to outsit eternity.  They're indomitable.""  So says the Doctor when he notices the rows of humans in suspended animation aboard the title vehicle, an example of the normal Positivist stance sci-fi takes.
The Doctor, Sarah, and Harry land on Space Station Nerva, which houses hundreds of humans in suspended animation.  Apparently, solar flares caused millions of Earth people to hide underground while a percentage of them was sent to Nerva, wake up after a few thousand years after the Earth cooled off, and resettle it.
Trouble is, the humans overslept by a couple thousand years, and during that time, they had a visitor, which Harry discovers--a green giant locust-like alien.  The crucial members of the crew, Vira, first medtech, and Noah, the ark's Prime Unit, are awoken, and prepare to resucitate the others.
Noah is then attacked by an alien, and before long, his body begins to metamorphose into that of a Wirrn.  His transformation is mental as well as physical, yet he constantly struggles to maintain his humanity as he's gradually absorbed into the Wirrn hivemind.
The concept of aliens using men for endoparasitism predates Alien by a good five years.  And look at the title of the story and at Noah's name.  The biblical connotations are obvious, as the mission is to repopulate an Earth destroyed by a catastrophe.  The difference is, Biblical Noah will live in a world where man and beast live in harmony, but in this story, humans are in danger of ""symbiotic atavism"", of an Earth ruled by aliens.
But the Wirrn and the humans on the Ark have a commonality.  The Wirrn are a collective hivemind, while the Ark survivors have a humorless, strictly hierarchical, coldly scientific, compared to the more warmer and less technical Doctor, Harry, and Sarah.  Indeed, when Vira coldly asks the Doctor and Harry if Sarah's of value, Harry incredulously says, ""Of value?  She's a human being like ourselves! What kind of question is that?""  Vira then tells the Doctor that Harry's a Romantic, to which the Doctor says, ""Perhaps we both are.""  This denotes the crossing out of the cerebral Positivism with a more warm-hearted Romanticism.
As a cost-cutting measure, the sets for Nerva were reused in Revenge Of The Cybermen, which was the next story shot after this, but aired as the last story of the season.  Trivia: the music played to Sarah in Episode 1 is taken from Georg Handel's Largo.  And why Episode 2 was the highest charting story, #5 and netting 13.6 million viewers on first airing, is anybody's guess, as I've seen better episodes.
As for the effects, the Ark model and interior are realized great, especially the cathedral-like cryogenics chamber, but the Wirrn larvae are wrapped in both sizes of bubble wrap sprayed green.
This story clearly puts human beings in a good light, and sees great potential for them.  As the message by the long-dead Earth Minister says, ""You are the chosen survivors.  You have been entrusted with a sacred duty, to see that human knowledge, human culture, human love and faith shall never perish from the universe.  Guard what we have given you with all your strength.""",1075334400,15,3473,4.915951972555746
409268,5,6302000610,"As I've said before, it's easy to overrate Doctor Who episodes, especially the Tom Baker ones, which, to me, tend to work the best.  The costumes hold up better than with most of the other Whos, the companions were a bit smarter, there was K-9, and I, like a lot of other Amercians, quite like Tom Baker's sense of humor.  Still, not all series work as well as others, and this one has quite a bit of science and is quite creepy as well.
This episode is the first in which Henry is a companion of the Dcctor along with Sarah, when they land on what appears to be a malfunctioning ""lifeboat"" in space.  The crew are in cryogenic suspension, the space station apparently the victim of some sort of infestation.  Initially, the doctor and crew merely have to restore power to the station in order to survive long enough to leave, but end up staying to help the crew, which is slowly coming out of 10,000 years of cryogenic suspension only to face a menace that threatens to end the human race.
This is an episode that seems to have solid science at its foundation, a thrilling and realistic sense of danger, and no shortage of brave humans.  As usual, the aliens are rather cheesy looking but, also as usual, when the story is this good, you learn to overlook it rather quickly and this series is quite reminiscent of Alien, which didn't come out until about 10 years later.  The show makes good use of its single setting and the acting is superb.  I hardly noticed the time going by with this one.  Highly recommended.",1073088000,6,1516,4.447653429602888

The sense of isolation thousands of years into the future, overshadowed by the looming threat of the Wirrn as they slowly awaken and breed to slaughter the sleeping humans on board the Ark is very well excecuted. The tension slowly builds accross four episodes and blends well into the next story (The Sontaran Experiment) making the last four stories from Tom's first season into a single coherent plotline.

409300,5,6302000610,"1974's Season 12 saw the introduction of a new Doctor in the form of Tom Baker and while the first story ""Robot"" had the public wondering what had happened to Jon Pertwee, the second story ""The Ark in Space"" made them quickly forget him.
The Doctor decides to take UNIT's chief surgeon, Lt Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter), on a quick trip in the TARDIS to prove to him that really was a space/time machine.  When Harry and Sarah (Elizabeth Sladen) emerge with the Doctor they discover themselves on space station in the far future.  The Doctor finds a damaged console and attempts to repair it to activate the station's life support system but accidentally engages the intruder defense system.  While the Doctor and Harry dodge energy blasts in the control room, a dazed Sarah is teleported to another part of the ship where she is placed into cryogenic suspension.  With the defense system deactivated, Harry and the Doctor set off to look for Sarah.  They eventually come across a stasis chamber full of preserved humans awaiting revival.  They locate Sarah's capsule and attempt to revive her.  Meanwhile the Doctor finds the mummified body of a giant wasp-like insect which appears to have damaged the space station's clock preventing the human from awakening.  With his repairs complete, the humans start to revive and the first one to emerge is Vira, the first Medtech, who is disgusted to find what she regards as primitive savages onboard her ship, is confused by the presence of the dead insect and then horrified to find that one of the capsules is missing its occupant and that the remains of an alien membrane are attached to the inside of the shell.  The Doctor deduces that the dead alien had laid eggs in the missing crewman which had hatched, devoured him and was now infesting the station's solar stacks.  In order to slow their development the Doctor heads off to shut down the stacks while more human are revived.  Sarah is reanimated along with two technicians and their leader, Noah.  Noah doesn't trust the strangers and follows the Doctor, preventing him from shutting off the power, but becoming infected by the Wirrn larvae.  The alien cells start to mutate Noah into an adult Wirrn and cause him to kill one of the revived Techs.  Other Wirrn start to emerge from their cocoons in the power room and the alien Noah demands the remaining human bodies in stasis be left as hosts for more Wirrn eggs...
Once again the BBC has done a wonderful job of remastering the prints onto DVD.  The story line is excellent and is somehow similar to Alien and you can't help but wonder if this might have made a good adult horror movie on the big screen if it had a bigger budget.  There is also the option to replace the laughable original model shots of the space station and the shuttle with new CGI effects in order to ""upgrade"" the show for a more modern audience that are not used to cardboard spaceships suspended from fishing lines.  A classic story with some excellent acting that will give you 90 minutes of pure viewing pleasure.  The commentary with Tom Baker, Elizabeth Sladen and Phillip Hinchcliffe provide a funny and interesting guide to the making of this fan-favourite romp!",1059177600,4,3200,4.735135135135135
409301,5,6302000610,"This story is one of the most interesting 'morality plays' of Dr. Who's series, which shows character portraits of trickery, faith, and insanity at its best.
Tom Baker's soliloquy to the sleeping humans in the cryogenic chamber 'Homosapiens, what an indomitable species!  It was only a millions ago since they crawled out of the mud and learned to walk!' is one of his best, next to the infamous one as Macbeth when one night he got a peanut stuck in the back of his throat (as he later told to Peter Haining).
The story, set at a time when the Earth is ravaged by solar flares, is a tense and terrifying one in which the future of humanity is threatened by the Wirrrn, speechless locust-like creatures whose former colonies were destroyed by humans on Andromeda.  Having taken over the body and mind of Noah, they seek their revenge by devouring the humans left but allowing the Doctor, his companions and the few revived Terra Nova humans to escape.
Kenton Moore's Noah and Richardson Morgan's Rogin show two determined men who despite the enormous trial end up sacrificing themselves for the sake of their people.
The story is memorable for one of the most incredible cliff-hangers - whereupon Noah disposes of the young Libri only to take his hand out of his pocket to find it turned into a green scaly mess of alien flesh where his gloating suddenly turns to an expression of horror.
Other scenes such as the Doctor taunting Sarah when she gets stuck in the air duct, the Doctor joining his mind to the Wirrrns and Noah begging his wife Vira to destroy him whilst his mind is being taken over show Dr. Who at its most ingenius to earn it the No. 5 rating in the UK TV charts in 1975 - the highest position the programme ever scored.

409303,5,6302000610,"The second of Tom Baker's many episodes as the Fourth Doctor, the Ark in Space is an excellent example of a well-written and well-executed Doctor Who story.
The basic plot: the TARDIS materializes on a space station soon found to be filled with human beings in suspended animation.  The Doctor quickly surmises that the station and its contents represent the whole of the human race and its knowledge, preserved to weather some terrible catastrophe.  Due to sabotage, the station's inhabitants have overslept by many thousand years.
The sabotage was carried out by one of the Wyrrn, a race of space-dwelling giant insects who visit planets only to reproduce.  The Wyrrn have decided to use the last humans as incubators for their young, and the Doctor, long-time favorite companion Sarah, and the reluctant Harry must prevent the Wyrrn from wiping out all humankind.
Whereas many episodes degenerated into camp (though at times very successfully), the Ark in Space does an excellent job at remaining true to its science fiction roots.  The episode does still offer plenty of wit as only Tom Baker could deliver it, yet it never lets the humor dominate the story.  The plot is tightly-done without side trips and tangents; the Doctor and crew are concerned with the Wyrrn and saving humanity, and that is the task they take on and accomplish.
The special effects (or defects) are suitably cheesily done as befitting the Dr. Who franchise, including the use og green bubble-wrap to create monsters.  But that's part of the charm of the series, and a point in Ark in Space's favor that the bad effects didn't lead to pure camp.
The DVD includes commentary (albeit somewhat disjointed due to the fact of its recording over twenty years after the airing of the actual episode); said commentary is interesting and gives a look at those who created the series.  The other features of the disc are decent but not spectacular on the whole.

409304,4,6302000610,"""The Ark in Space"" is one of those titles DVD-enthusiastic fans saw coming a long, long way away. It was one of the first videos, one of only a handful of stories released on laserdisc, and maintains a consistent popularity that regularly puts it at the top of the list when people think of ""great Tom Baker stories"", or even great Doctor Who in general. I know several fans - myself included - who had actively expected either ""Ark"" or ""Pyramids of Mars"" to start off the post-""Five Doctors"" range of DVDs, and were disappointed by the choice of ""The Robots of Death""; I'm happy to say, however, that it was well worth the wait.
I was quite taken aback by the video element of ""The Ark in Space"". Although the actual quality is probably no better than that of ""Robots"", there is no irritating jitter to one side of the screen, and the colors seem - well, more vibrant, somehow. I was quite taken aback by the video element of ""The Ark in Space"". Although the actual quality is probably no better than that of ""Robots"", there is no irritating jitter to one side of the screen, and the colors seem - well, more vibrant, somehow. This is something I clearly noticed on all the previous releases except ""Robots"", so I am definitely happy to report that the Tom Baker stories have just as good a chance as any to look alive and fresh on DVD.
Most publicized amongst the extra features are the new CGI model effects. You have the menu option to either watch the story with the original model effects from 1975, or see the new ones integrated throughout. Personally, I would go for the former option Here's what bothered me about the new CGI: while the medium and long shots of Nerva Beacon are undeniably gorgeous and very atmospheric, any time the Ark passes directly in front of the camera - the two prime examples are in Part 1 - my disbelief was instantly shattered. It is clearly a computer-generated model, and looks very fake that close to the viewer, without any shadows to hide it. While the original 1975 model shots are hokey, and a touch embarrassing, I am at least used to them - so I'll continue watching the story that way.
The DVD also contains a number of other extras, ranging from the excellent - a 1975 interview with Tom Baker, a 2001 interview with designer Roger Murray-Leach, and an brilliant production trivia subtitle track, to the ridiculous - a new CGI ""space station schematic feature"", and the mind-numbing Howard Da Silva PBS voiceovers. Most of the extras, including a commentary with Tom Baker, Lis Sladen and producer Philip Hinchcliffe, a reconstructed trailer, cast biographies and a photo gallery, fall somewhere in the middle - worth watching once, anyway.
For all my criticisms, ""The Ark in Space"" is a must-have Doctor Who DVD. Sure, several of the extras are lightweight, but what good ones there are prove very, very good, and the story is of a very high caliber to begin with.

The story marks a return to the Doctor of old, careering around the universe as in the pre Pertween days. It also marks the start of the establishment of the character of the new Doctor now that a little distance has passed between him and the Mark 3 verison.
The plot concerns an apparently deserted space station which contain cryogenically frozen humans in a suspended animation which has lated tens of thousands of years. There is significant evidence that there is something else being there too eventually being identified as the Wirrin who intende to consume the frozen humans and colonise the earth.
While the plot is certainly interesting, it does seem to me that it is not the crucial aspect to this adventure. It seems to be more setting the scene from which the new Doctor can emerge. The thrust of the story is to establish Tom Baker as the Doctor. In many people's eyes he was to become The Doctor, but that was to be much later.
This Doctor appears younger, relatively than any of his forebears. His dress, although not the more formal dree or morning coat of the first two was not so dandyish as th the third. His clothing too, with more browns and muted colours indicated a warmer, touchier almost fuzzier type of person than the others. Although he certainly had a more serious side, he did not have the sense of gravitas that the earlier Doctors clearly had. His physical appearance, particularly his height, was more powerful but the respect from others more often than not had to be earned.
Throughout this adventure the Doctor was seen to be distracted by novel and interesting things and developments which stimulated his intellectual curiosity while at the same time causing him to lose sight of events closer to home. Yet at the same time his apparent lack of interest in events could often be mistaken for lack of concern when in reality he chose to think while apparently resting. His quick wit and sudden changes epitomised his flamboyant nature and mercurial mind.
This character was thrown into sharp relief especially during this adventure with the comparison made with the latest companion, Harry. His military training and medical mind contrast sharply with the Doctor heightening the perception of intelectual prowess. Thes use of the companions as a contrasting device is also useful at exploring the softer, one could almost say human, aspect of the Doctor's character. With Sarah Jane the Doctor is seen as a much more understanding and compassionate person than in previous incarnations. In a sense this increases the perception of his own humanity, a feature which is further exposed in the later dealings with the Gallifreyians.
All in all a great fourt Doctor adventure and one well worth having.
This new DVD version of the four episode adventure is a joy to own. As well as commentaries from Tom baker himself there are those from Elisabeth Sladen and Philip Hinchcliffe and all sorts of other extras. The picture and sound are much clener, clearer and crisper which adds to the overall effect.

All in all a great fourt Doctor adventure and one well worth having.",1034121600,,2829,4.859213250517598
409308,4,6302000610,"The Doctor, out to prove to Dr. Harry Sullivan (RN) that the London Police call box actually houses the TARDIS, a time/space machine, whisks the two of them along with Sarah Jane Smith off into deep space and the distant future.  Leaving the TARDIS, the group finds themselves inside of an apparently empty space station.  Disabling some elaborate security devices, they learn that the station is actually an ark containing the last survivors of humanity - genetically perfect specimens in suspended animation and intended to repopulate an Earth becoming livable after devastation by solar flares.  One of the ""Adams"" is missing, and the Doctor soon finds the station infested with Wirrin - huge and intellligent insects who want the Earth for themselves.  To get Earth, the Wirrin need to eliminate the humans.  With the survivors' leader infected by the Wirrin and turned him into one of them, the Doctor and the remaining survivors struggle to secure the station and somehow defeat the intelligent and implacable insects.
This was an excellent episode for so many reasons.  The set design convincingly detailed the claustrophobic insides of the Ark.  An excellent script and great acting obviates your having to know the complicated continuity of Dr. Who (the Doctor, an expatriate member of a race of long-lived Time Lords, travels across the space/time continuum righting wrongs, saving the cosmos and occasionally picking up or losing various strangers who join the cast; stories are told in multi-part serials of about a half-hour each, but the serials themselves are linked; the Doctor's advanced physiology allows him to ""regenerate"" whenever he's mortally wounded, becoming a totally new man - this Doctor is numero quatro), and for a change, the alien menace are completely new and not Daleks again.  And of course we've got Sarah Jane Smith.  The pacing is excellent, the suspense unending and the cheesy production values shine.  If you're going to get one Dr. Who tape, this is the one to get.",1032998400,,2007,5.110091743119266
409309,3,6302000610,"Greeting, people! I has been a big fan of Doctor Who since I was a kid and I am delighted to see Doctor Who comes on DVD. When I bought this DVD, I was thrilled to see the DVD have captions included. When I turned the captions on, I noticed something strange about the episodes during the captions turned on. From the part 1 to the end of part 4 I think, I noticed several times the screen got really dark for few secs and came back normal. I turned the captions off and tried again. I see no problem of seeing screen turning dark for few secs. I tried to turn my TV closed captions on but it didn't show up. I was sadden that the TV captions didn't show up on this DVD and was sadden more when the DVD is deflected with captions causing the screen on TV to goes dark for few seconds. For like example, when the Part one open up to Ark in Space, when the ark move  into the center of the screen, the screen got really dark, barely see the ark on it for few secs then I can see hte ark better. I returned the DVD to Media Play and got new one of same DVD like this. I tried to see if it would have same problems or not. THe new Doctor WHo:ark in space DVD I just got, after replacing the other copy, it has same deflects in same areas. I feared that all copies of Doctor Who:Ark in Space may be deflected. Anyone notice about this problems or anyone know how we can replace these DVDs with deflect-free DVDs?
That's why I placed the rating at 3 because of captions causing the deflects. Thank you.",1032739200,,1496,4.037037037037037
409360,5,6302000610,"This 4 part adventure reminds me on the movie ""Alien"", but has been made five years before.
It is the 4th Doctor's second performance and a true classic. Full of suspense (escpecially after part 1) and one of the best Whos ever!",1031097600,,228,4.4523809523809526
409361,5,6302000610,"""The Ark in Space"" is one of those stories I watched at age 11, only a couple of months after discovering ""Doctor Who"" on PBS.  It instantly became one of my favorites, and remained so even after I'd seen the other 26 years' worth of stories.  What makes ""Ark"" a great ""Doctor Who"" story is the list of usual suspects: small cast, claustrophobic setting, some moments of real horror (1974 special-effects style) as the Ark commander is turned into a 6-foot-tall fiberglass wasp, after becoming gradually encased in green bubble-wrap.  And, of course, Tom Baker's larger-than-life performance as the Doctor.
The ""Doctor Who"" DVD releases have been of uniformly high quality.  Each episode comes with a pop-up track of subtitled production notes, and an audio commentary by the cast and crew.  The ""Ark"" production notes include details on the original script for the story, and memorably inform us that bubble wrap was not as common in 1974 as it is today!  The commentary track is one of the better ones: Elisabeth Sladen, who played companion Sarah Jane, has terrific recall and some intriguing insights into the original production that I hadn't read or heard elsewhere.  Series producer Philip Hinchcliffe supplies enough inside information into the sets, lighting, and script editing process to be informative without ever getting stuffy -- and his recall is excellent, too.
The star of the commentary track is, naturally, Tom Baker.  Tom's involvement with DW since leaving the role has been infrequent and bizarre.  His contribution to the track involves frightening barks of laughter at lingering shots of the male actors' physique, or double entendres in the script (intentional or otherwise).  He confesses from the opening seconds that he ""can't recall a single thing"" about the story, and this frees him up to be the irreverent, unpredictable voice circling effortlessly around Sladen and Hinchcliffe's scholarship.
There are other extra features -- an informative, current interview with the episode designer, and a vintage, bizarre interview with Baker in costume.  There are 7 minutes of original (silent) model test footage.  Help yourself.  I fast-forwarded through this after my resolve was defeated somewhere around Minute Three.  The 3D Ark schematic is brief, and thus cute.  The redone CGI effects work better than you might expect when viewed as part of the story via seamless branching, and of course you can always turn it off.  The ""unused title sequence"" has some interesting outtakes, but the final 30 seconds are, in fact, the used title sequence.  The photo gallery is a must-skip.  There's a strange ""TARDIS-cam"" view which appears to be a new creation; this is atmospheric, if pointless.
There are reportedly three hidden easter eggs, of which I've only found one.  Again, it's Tom Baker, in costume, being bizarre.  I can't wait to find the other two.",1030233600,37,2883,5.132762312633833
409362,5,6302000610,"Another classic Who serial is finally on DVD in all its glory. Not only is the serial itself, wonderful, the extras that accompany the disc are incredible bonuses. The Doctor, Sarah Jane and Harry arrive on Space Station Nerva and discover that something is not all right. An alien has invaded the main solar stack to absorb energy to grow. At the same time, the Human Race is awaking from cryogenic sleep a few thousand years beyond their wake-up call, and are in danger of being absorbed, physically and mentally from the Wirnn. This serial really helps jump start the Tom Baker era. It really is a good example of a taught, suspenseful Who adventure. Kudos again to the Restoration Team for their incredible transfer ans bonus material on the disc.",1028851200,,751,4.740458015267175
409363,5,6302000610,"The Doctor is taking Sarah and, new companion, Harry on a joy flight in the TARDIS when they land on what seems to be an unoccupied space station. They are soon caught up in a race to save the surviving human race who are using this space station as a resting place for when the Solar Flare radiation on the Earth has dropped to liveable levels again. Something else has invaded this station causing the occupants to oversleep. The Wirrn are here to claim the sleeping vestiges of the human race as their dinner...
This is the 2nd story for the Tom Baker reign as Doctor Who and it seems he has settled into the role superbly. The story, acting, set design are all fantastic. That is, if you can accept the fact that green bubble wrap is about to take over the human race. Back in the 70's, the bubble wrap larvae of the Wirrn would have looked great as bubble wrap was a new thing, now it looks dated and cant be watch without a sly comment or a laugh. This does not detract from the great acting from the 3 regulars though.
The DVD transfer is excellent, picture quality is in full frame and is in great condition. Extras on the DVD are getter better with each one released. The Extras on the disc include:
New CGI Model Shots
You can now watch this classic with either it's original shakey model shots or you can watch it with the newly created CGI model shots of the Ark. It's great to see someone taking time to do this sort of stuff.
Original 16mm Model shots
Take after boring take of the original model shots of the ark turning, the Wirrn crawling over the Ark and the escape ship blasting off, great to see but very monotonous.
Commentary
An unmissable commentary by Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen and Philip Hinchcliffe. Some interesting tidbits are found through this plus Tom's enjoyment is fantastic.
Design Feature
An interview with designer Roger Murray-Leach
News Item
A rare interview with Tom Baker (although it was done when he was filming Revenge Of The Cybermen)
Unused title sequence (thank God they didn't use it)
Trailer - this trailer wouldn't make anyone watch this show.
TARDIS Cam - also on the BBC website - this teases us with showing what Doctor Who would look if it were still on.
3D Ark Scematic, Photo Gallery and a couple of Easter Eggs for you to find.
Overall an excellent DVD for an excellent episode. RECOMMENDED!!!",1027987200,2,2351,4.508196721311475
409364,2,6302000610,I enjoy most any Dr. Who with Tom Baker.  The quality of this tape is very poor however.  Had to adjust every control on my TV just to watch it.,1014595200,2,144,3.7666666666666666
409365,4,6302000610,"Ark in space is was a good episode as far as it goes.
  Sarah was of course Sarah part doer and part screamer.  I think in general this episode plays down her character.  After all she is a reporter, we should see her questioning more.
Harry and Tom Baker's Doctor (particularly Harry) got a chance to develop their personalities as characters.  Although I enjoyed the episode and the performances it seemed like Jon Pertwee could  have pulled off this one just as well if not better.  Not because Baker did a poor job, far from it, but I think this was more of a vanalla episode to ease in a new Doctor.  Watching it I almost think the script may have been written before Baker took the part.
  We have a stong supporting cast, (the complaining engineer was a nice change from the elitist characters of Noah & Vira) and a more than passable adventure that serves as a good link to the next three episodes.
  I suspect the writers made Mr. Baker's part more generic because he was new to the part.  This is understandable but different from how the pervious changover was done.  That problem would quickly go away on a planet named Skaro, but that's another review.",1012089600,3,1165,4.485714285714286
409366,4,6302000610,"I'm pleased to see that the majority of folks reviewing this tape have given it high marks. ""Ark In Space"" was my favorite Liz Sladen era episode as a young 'un, and I was delighted to finally have the episode on tape to view as an adult and contemplate the very eloquent story it aspires to tell. Sadly, in my eyes, this is one of the scripts that really suffered because of the limited budget and time alloted to its filming. After thirty years of Kubrick and Lucas and Ridley Scott, there are moments in this adventure where the nickle and dime set construction and effects shots really mar at one's suspension of disbelief. I admit that the white, sterile atmosphere of the Beacon [along with the THX 1138ish white jumpsuit costumes, in which Liz Sladen has never looked better] does create a convincing sense of place that is well suited for the teriffic story the episodes relate, but there are moments when you can see through the world they represent and realize that we are looking at a low budget Sci Fi TV set. The hybernation pods that the Nerva crew emerge from look especially phony -- you can even see the saw marks on Vira's chamber as the camera lingers on her face, revealing that it is indeed a carved piece of styrofoam and the door hinged with a brownish packing tape. But then again, when you put a Doctor Who tape in your deck you are sort of signing a ""suspension of disbelief waiver form"" where stuff like that isn't supposed to matter, so I am just being picky and spoiled. The charictarizations and complexity of the story line more than make up for it, and I love the scenes of the tortured Noah as he transforms into a half man half walking glob of green spray painted bubble wrap. You gotta love it. Recommended.",1007164800,2,1742,4.481132075471698
409367,5,6302000610,"The writers of Alien stole the plot from Ark in Space, and Star Trek stole from it and many other Who stories for the concept of the Borg (""Resistance is useless... We should absorb the humans...""). This is not only one of the best examples of Doctor Who ever, but a classic in every sense. The acting is exemplary, particularly by Tom Baker as the Doctor. This was Baker's second story as the fourth Doctor, and his portrayal of this alternately hillarious and strangely frightening incarnation is truly astonishing...much more so than in the earlier story, ""Robot"".",1006300800,,567,4.855670103092783

Harry is simply wonderful in this story and  manages to entertain throughout, naively fumbling his way through the  story, trying to get to grips with a totally new reality.  This leads to  some great dialogue and interaction between Dr. Sullivan and the  inhabitants of the Ark.  As well as having its humourous moments, this  story is also quite a serious thriller in which our heroes have to take on  the might of a plague of genetically modified locusts, (yes - quite  literally! )  It has all the usual hallmarks of a Who classic and firmly  establishes itself as an absolute all-time favourite.",961545600,2,843,4.691780821917808

7819524,4,6302000610,"The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) materializes the TARDIS on a space station orbiting the Earth in the far distant future. The Doctor explores with his companions Sarah Jane (Elisabeth Sladen) and Harry (Ian Marter), only to discover the station is deserted (except for thousands of people in cryogenic sleep) and apparently sabotaged. The Doctor makes some repairs which activates the security, causing complications. Also, the repairs start the revival sequence for the humans on board. They've been set aside to avoid an apocalyptic disaster on Earth, though they should have been revived centuries ago. The problem is the Wirm, a parasitic intergalactic species that landed on the station a long time ago and is now attempting to take over all the humans. Can the Doctor and his companions save humanity?

The story has a slow start (the first of the four episodes is almost dispensable) but picks up speed as it goes along. One of the revived humans, the station's commander who is nicknamed Noah (hence the ""ark""), gets infected and becomes the main villain, though he struggles to maintain his humanity even as he slowly transforms into a Wirm. The special effects are low-budget (the aliens are actors covered in green bubble wrap!) and are, at best, less convincing to contemporary eyes. The commander's struggles against transformation are overacted and also less satisfying (and there's a weird edit that's explained in the supplemental material on the DVD). Even so, his character has an interesting arc that isn't as obvious as it seems. The ultimate resolution isn't surprising but is satisfying.

Tom Baker is in top form as the Doctor. He combines the intelligence and arrogance with a sense of wonder and admiration of humans that makes him an inspirational hero. He hardly ever resolves his problems with fighting (either fisticuffs or laser guns). Often the show lets the companions do that stuff. Baker is charming and odd, with plenty of eccentricity and cleverness to see the situation through.
