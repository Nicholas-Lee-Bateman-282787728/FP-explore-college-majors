809785,1,6304212674,Not what I expected. I bought to fast. I wanted it on Dvd. Won't happen again.,1417132800,2,78,3.9375
809786,5,6304212674,"Another one of my favorites from beginning to end another of those ""I'll watch it again and again ""movies",1412812800,2,105,4.578947368421052
809787,4,6304212674,"If you want to see a movie with blood, gore, nudity, language, and action, then you've come to the right place.  Based on true facts, the Barker's were bad!  Wish I could get it on DVD.  A historical must see!!!",1391817600,2,211,4.225
809788,5,6304212674,"I thought the bar scene was excellent, with Eric Roberts, The bartender in the background was fantastic and very handsome, but of course I was the bartender in this movie.....",1365120000,3,175,4.866666666666666
809789,1,6304212674,"This is a really good and entertaining movie if you like thriller, action, and suspense; but this is a very bad copy. The worst I've every seen(that's the problem-i can't see the movie). First and last time buying from amazon.",1361232000,3,226,4.675
809790,5,6304212674,"I was really shocked at this movie.  I really expected an almost ""B"" film.  Was shocked at how well the plot was, and the dialect was superp.  This film is well worth watching, and be careful, you might find yourself watching it a second time.  I know I did.",1063929600,3,258,4.204081632653061
809791,1,6304212674,"This movie is definately a ""public enemy"" and is one of the most shoddy productions possible. I am an Eric Roberts fan, but this poor effort is not to be believed! Low budget, poor acting, total lack of a script, and non-sensical scenes combine for a major disaster....BEWARE!!",1055894400,7,277,4.791666666666667
809792,5,6304212674,"Public Enemies is an excellent movie. The actors all play their characters well and the movie is packed with PLENTY of violence, with a touvh of romance. You have to admit to feeling sorry for Ma Barker and her boys  because for all of them, the end is anything but beautiful.
P.S. I almost  forgot to say, my little sister is the neice of Gavin Harrison, who plays  Freddie Barker",959558400,,381,4.414285714285715

I thought it cheesy then and that opinion hasn't changed.",1500336000,,106,4.631578947368421
7864816,1,6304212674,The only problem is I wanted it in dvd form which when I bought it I thought you sent a dvd not having to watch it on Amazon. I don't have internet or wifi and the only way I can see it is if I am near wifi or somebody has internet.,1488412800,,232,3.480769230769231
7864817,5,6304212674,"GREAT MOVIE.
I gave it 5 stars for a lot of reasons. great casting job, plenty of action, followed the time line of the barkers really well, and most of all, i like all movies that told the story of my late in-laws.",1484956800,,215,4.023255813953488
7864818,5,6304212674,"Loved this movie! Even though I am partial because I know one of the actresses, it is still a great movie. They did an amazing job using so much of Guthrie, Oklahoma to film the movie. They left most of the buildings just as they are except the scene where they are robbing the ""Bank of Arkansas"" they added a sign over a Guthrie building that is still there. I never really knew the story of the Barker gang but this movie shed some light on why they did what they did. Great movie! James Marsden is so young in it and does an amazing job portraying his part.",1483920000,,560,4.146788990825688
