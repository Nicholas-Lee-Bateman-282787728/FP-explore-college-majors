This will only be available at this relatively inexpensive price before the 2 disc each special editions come out.  As a movie fan, I've always been impressed with the quality of the Trek flicks.",1012867200,,467,4.5476190476190474
1641048,5,B00005OAZZ,"Once again the whiners are out in force.  These DVDs are wonderful.  It is true thaere are not many special features.  However, these movies are great sci-fi (at least most of them) and stand on their own merit.  I think Paramount was great for releasing them.
As far as the classic TV series.  I bought all 40 volumes and love them.  The list (x-files, Simpsons etc.) are all shows made in the '80s and thus did not take as much work to bring to DVD.  The Simpsons is already broadcast in Dolby Digital so again not much work went into it.  No one has asked how much it cost Paramount to restore the old series to near pristine condition and add 5.1.  40 Volumes relaeased over 3 years at around 13.99 a volume seems reasonable to me for an old show.  I understand they are releasing an entire season of TNG at one time.  They can do that with a newer show.  TNG is sub par to the original series in content anyhow, but I won't get into that.  So stop whining about Paramount, watch these 9 movies and enjoy them, the way they were meant to be enjoyed.",1010275200,16,1053,4.231155778894473
1641049,1,B00005OAZZ,"Greetings, all. I was gonna warn you to not get this set 'cause Paramount will soon be releasing all of these in Special Edition format. Slowly. One by one. Probably on a monthly-to-bi-monthly basis, so they can all revel in the glee of the DVD-collectin' Trekkies' frustration whilst rakin' in the bucks from the sorry people who bought the regular-edition flicks. Like I did, unfortunately.
However, it looks like a couple folks have beaten me to it in the kvetching department. So, just ignore my review, and take a look at what my other fellow Amazonians are saying about this sad collection. As you can see, we're pretty much on the same page regarding this situation. Thank you for your attention.

1641050,2,B00005OAZZ,"I was patient.  I waited and waited for this box set.  I steadfastly held out and did not buy the individual DVDs so I could buy them all at once with the new, exciting features I was sure this set would contain.  I should have known better.
Mind you, the box itself is nice, but that's about it.  Paramount is once again finding a way to milk the Trek fans for more money with a sub-standard product.  There are virtually no extras, the sound and picture quality are nice (the Motion Picture does have a cleaner look & clearer sound) but almost every DVD I own is better than these.  I am very, very disappointed.  Not surprised, though.  Paramount is famous for this.  Look at the DVDs for the TV shows.  While other big TV shows put out beautifully packaged box sets with extras and cool features (see X-Files, Sopranos, & The Simpsons for best examples) Paramount makes us pay (dollar amount) per DVD for 2 episodes with nothing special about them at all.  At that pace, you'll spend over (dollar amount) for the whole series.  I have the first 4 seasons of the X-Files (nearly 100 episodes - Original Trek had around 65) & I've spent (dollar amount).  This is called greed, ladies and gentlemen.
But I digress.  My advice is this: Next year, the 10th Trek movie comes out.  This gives them 18-20 months to come up with some new extras & package all 10 films.  Hold out, be brave, and pray that Paramount decides to be nice to the fans who have supported them and Trek for more than 30 years.",1005782400,57,1496,4.405109489051095
1641051,2,B00005OAZZ,"Ever since I bought a DVD player, this has been the day I have been waiting for!!!  The day when Star Trek comes out with a collection set of all their DVD's.

As I feared, the colleciton comes with all the what I call ""naked"" DVD's in it.

What a waste!!!  Paramount had the perfect opportunity to hit us with a collection of DVD's that were packed with extra features from all the films!!!  You will not convince me otherwise that Paramount is doing this just to make money and turn around and sell the better version of these DVD's later!!!  If that is the case Paramount, then shame on you!!!!

You have enough money, so give the people what they deserve!!!!!  A collection with deleted scenes, commmentary, still photos(there are millions of those!!!).

This is basically pathetic!!  Don't waste your money so Paramount will come out with a product worthy of Star Trek fans!!!",1004745600,61,881,4.625806451612903
1641052,3,B00005OAZZ,"This is the collection all Trekkies have been waiting for.  For the rest of us (Sci-Fi fans in general), its a little pricey.  Personally, I wouldn't spend nearly ... on a DVD collection that includes so-so movies like Star Trek I and V.  It would be a lot better if Paramount realeased the good ones in a separate collection (II, IV, VI, First Contact, and Insurection).",1004400000,4,371,4.590909090909091
1641053,3,B00005OAZZ,"This set doesn't work out to much of a bargain. And with no special packaging (like the tapes had) or additional DVDs (like a ""A Tribute to Star Trek"" or ""How We Made All These Movies: A Ken Burns Film"" or something value-added) this collection seems a little more like a convenience item for someone who hasn't already purchased the DVD's than a must have for the collector.

Because up until November 6th's release of The Motion Picture, the ST movie DVDs have had NO extras except for a trailer! Besides being overpriced for such bare bones editions, I found it insulting that Paramount would release such obviously collectible movies as anything less than Special Collector Editions jam-packed with extras... and had a feeling that they would start doing that AFTER they were finished releasing the bare bones editions, to make fans eat it twice - and lo and behold, Paramount has announced plans to revisit the movies as Special Editions... So its incredible that even then they're releasing this boxed set. WHY buy it? Wait until they release the Special Editions!",1003795200,112,782,4.843283582089552

1641057,2,B00005OAZZ,"That's all that this is.  A way to get you to spend more money.  They already released a boxed set with all nine movies in it, but it only contained one special edition (ST1) and the rest were regular releases.  This time, they added two more special editions (ST's 2 & 3).  For Petes sake guys, wait until they release a box set with ALL of them special edition, or just buy them each individually as each of the special editions come out.  Yes, this is the cheapest way to get all the movies currently, but if you're a special edition freak like me, just wait a little longer.  IV is coming out on Sp. Ed. soon anyhow, so you're just going to end up spending another 20 bucks in a few months.
Or just buy the Star Wars movies instead, cuz they're a much better sci-fi series. :-P",1035244800,9,781,4.208053691275167

But come on - what's the sense of releasing a set of movies in a box, with two of them director's cuts, and the rest not? Either make the whole set director's cuts (which I'm sure Paramount will do once all nine {or by then ten} movies are 'special-featured') or make it a set of plain vanilla versions and at a reduced price.",1034640000,4,493,4.311827956989247
1641059,1,B00005OAZZ,"I am a long time Star Trek fan, but I would not spend my money on getting this set of all nine films.  First, I didn't like all nine films.  Second, only one out of nine films in the set contains a director's cut and extra material.
Paramount will be releasing each of the Star Trek films as director's cuts.  ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" was just released as a director's cut and I have read that the director's cut of ""Star Trek III"" will be coming out later this year.
I'm really dissappointed that Paramount released the nine Star Trek films with only one director's cut.  Sometime after the theatetrical release of ""Star Trek X: Nemesis"" later this year, I expect all of the Star Trek films to be available as director's cuts and to contain other bonus material.  A set of all 10 director's cuts would be a truly great set!",1028764800,13,833,4.348387096774194
1641060,5,B00005OAZZ,"These are very good movies!!! I was very surprised that the review was low.  Even though I'm 11 my Dad got me into the TREK movies. If you like SCI-FI you will LIKE THIS. There's action, Drama and basicaly any thing else you can think of.  There are some downfalls like 1 of them isn't very long and there's not alot of action, but I must of watched it 100 times, so it dosen't come to me like it used to.  I know some friends that like this movie he best. All the other movies are 100,000,0000,000,000,000 stars.<there are 6, it's 4>",1026086400,,534,4.215686274509804
1641061,4,B00005OAZZ,"There's not much to be said about the Star Trek movies that you don't already know.  Either you don't care for the series, in which case you're not reading this review.  Or you know them, love them and you're just trying to decide how to spend your hard-earned money.  So I'm not going to aim this review at describing the movies, but the DVD set.
It's simple:  If you MUST have the movies today, you might want to buy the set.  They're all in widescreen, the transfers are top notch.  Not a lot of extras for the most part, except for Star Trek I.  But you will not be displeased.
On the other hand, you should strongly consider whether you're going to let Paramount double-dip you on this one.  They are slowly releasing special edition/director's cuts of the movies.  So this box, with one special edition, will soon get replaced with one with two special editions (Wrath of Kahn SE is due out in August), then one with three, etc. With each one, you will get more extras, some restored scenes and possibly improved sound.  This especially applies to the early movies.  The Star Trek I special edition is a noticeable and substantially improved over the old DVD.
So I'd personally save my money and buy each special edition as it comes out or wait until the whole set is done.  The more you let studios double-dip and take your money from you twice, the more that will encourage them to do it.",1024531200,18,1396,4.474308300395257
1641062,2,B00005OAZZ,"I've always tried to shy away from the typical Trek fan's tendancy to gripe and complain about everything. In fact, I'm rather outspoken about the fact that I think certain factions of Trek fans are the biggest bunch of whiners ever. I am not a whiner. I liked Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. I enjoyed Star Trek Generations and I thought Kirk's death was fine. I like the ""Enterprise"" series and I have never once felt the urge to cry about the theme song. I'm NOT a Trek-malcontent.
However, I am sorry that I must complain about the treatment of the Trek films on DVD. With the recent exception of Star Trek-The Motion Picture, these films truly are ""bare bones"" DVD format. These movies had such great potential to be jazzed up with extras and commentaries, and you end up with nothing. What's more...there are rumors circulating that Paramount will soon be releasing special editions of all the films. I hope this is so, becuase I will not purchase a single Star Trek DVD (except for TMP) untill this is done. I'm not going to waste my money.
Let's review this collection:
ST-The Motion Picture:  This is what they SHOULD be.
STII: The Wrath of Khan:  One trailer, no other extras. There were at least 3 minutes of deleted scenes added to ABC's broadcast back in the 80's. Let's see some of that again.
STIII: The Search for Spock: One trailer, no other extras. How cool would it be to listen to a commentary by Leonard Nimoy? I KNOW that there are deleted scenes to be had here too.
STIV: The Voyage Home: Trailers and some bogus featurette that is on one of the VHS versions anyway (oooooo!) Now imagine how cool it would be to have that commentary by Nimoy AND Nicholas Meyers?
STV: The Final Frontier: 2 Trailers, no extras. This film could stand the same treatment that ST-The Motion Picutre got. I've read a lot about what Shatner's original vision was and how it was paired down because of budget cuts and the writer's strike. Let's see some improved visual effects and hear Shatner's commentary. And I KNOW that there were some cool deleted scenes here too.
STVI: The Undiscovered Country: 2 trailers. Let's see the TV campaign, there were some excellent ads for this film. Another excellent opportunity for Director's Commentary. More deleted scenes. Making of documentaries.
ST Generations: This one is totally empty. For god's sake, I have the trailer on the beginning of my VHS copy of Mission:Impossible, but they couldn't put it on the disk??? There were a ton of deleted scenes here...most alarming are those cut featuring Kirk at the beginning of the film. Also, there was an alternate ending filmed with a different death for Kirk (you can read about it in his Movie Memories book AND it is evidneced in the trailer).
ST:First Contact:  Trailers, but no other features. Let's hear Jonathan Frakes' commentary. I know that there were ""making of"" featurettes for this movie. Let's see some deleted scenes, cast bios, better menus...c'mon! This thing was a blockbuster in the theatres!
ST:Insurrection: Trailers and a half-hearted making of featurette. The TV ad campaign for this film was cool. Another chance to hear Frakes. Also, there were different story angles that weren't shown in the final film and plenty of deleted scenes (including some more Riker-Troi stuff).
Message: WE KNOW you have the goods Paramount. Now fork it over or you'll be sorry!",1018224000,,3376,4.777397260273973
1641063,4,B00005OAZZ,"The Special features of any DVD are a
nice addition to the quality we expect
from DVD.  But the whole point of DVD
is Digital-Quality Audio-Video.  Of the
highest possible that MPEG-2 can deliver.
And DVD Movies deliver that.  The quality
is at same level as Broadcast.  Blowing
away VHS & Internet Streaming.  This is
why DVD was invented.  To give the
consumer the highest potential Audio-
Video quality.  If the DVD includes
Special Features, then this adds to
the already great DVD experience.  I
love the special features too, just
like anyone out there.  Its makes DVD
even more desirable.  As though the
Digital Audio-Video experience wasn't
enough.  I will applaud the release
of the Special Editions of the Star
Wars Trilogy & Special Editions of
Star Trek Movies.  But, I can be content
with the awesome Digital Experience of
the current Star Trek 9-disc collection
too.
I fear we are getting spoiled with
Special Edition features.  Though,
they are nice.  I do not think they
are absolutely required.
Remember where we were with VHS.  Look
where we are with DVD.  We've come
along way.  VHS is being phased out.
Though, it will still appeal to the
Camcorder and home movie market.
Analog TV itself is slowly being
phased out.  Digital is truely the
way of the future.  That holds true

A NEW BOX SET with that 10th Movie is out now.
Heads Up -- this 9 movie set (which I own and watched) and the other 10 movie collection do not include all of the Special Editions.  So you get a little less bonus material, and it is pricey.  But hey, it is Star Trek.
The First 3 films in this set have two discs with lots of extras, interviews, trekkie stuff.  The other six are single discs only, and honestly they are pretty light on anything ""bonus"".  Like nil.
The Films are old, and it shows.  Just look at the trailers on STTMP, and you'll know what I mean.  The effects really do look corny by today's standards, but the stories are solid and the acting is decent -- more or less throughout the whole series.
I will skip the review of each film, and sum it up -- this is a solid buy for the first 9 movies, but additional special edition discs will be coming out soon.

7948812,3,B00005OAZZ,"(Opinions of The Motion Picture and The Undiscovered Country are based on years old memory)
The original Star Trek crew worked solely on the basis of its lead trio.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley made for arguably the most charismatic and enjoyable trio to watch in cinematic history.  As for the rest of the crew, I didn't much care for anyone else, though George Takei probably came across the best as Sulu, mostly because he never succumbs to the silliness that pervades the other three (Scotty's prat falls, Chekov's accents and mispronunciations, and Uhura's horrific dance number in Star Trek V).
It's been years since I've seen The Motion Picture, and memory serves that it was an engrossing adventure that was so far off from the camp I'd been used to while watching the original TV series.  Basically, I liked it, and this is without having seen the director's cut, which I hope to catch some day.  The Motion Picture is decidedly an attempt at the kind of cerebral science fiction that 2001 attempted, and while I'm quite certain it's not in the same league as that film, it holds its own.
Ooh, boy, it's with The Wrath of Khan that I'm sure people will shouting blasphemy when I state that I actually didn't much enjoy the film.  Sure, the effects were good and the trio was as entertaining to watch as usual, but Nicholas Meyers' direction is stale, Ricardo Montalban is a cheesy-looking villain (that fake chest can't help, either) who talks tough without actually proving his dangerousness, and the space battles prove to be little different than two submarines stalking each other.  The idea of two starships battling each other has never appealed to me, and the case is no different here.  I will admit, however, that Spock's death scene is poignant.
Star Trek III is even worse than II.  Cheap-looking sets, meaningless blather, and the overall snail pace make this easily the most boring film of the entire franchise.  The only highlight is Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon commander.
Star Trek IV is a marked improvement, an enjoyable and funny fish-out-of-water tale.  There's little else going on here than seeing our beloved crew interact in the 20th century, but that alone is enough to inspire a barrage of belly laughs, particularly Spock's use of colorful metaphors.  Catherine Hicks' rather neurotic performance as a whale specialist is pretty annoying, and a downspot in an otherwise entertaining outing.
Star Trek V is easily the silliest of the lot, but it's also kind of fun and the premise is the most ambitious of them all: it's an all-out quest for God, who is believed to live in the center of the galaxy.  The trio is given more screentime together here than in any other film, Jerry Goldsmith's score is marvelous (the best of the series), and there's actually a genuine sense of awe when they reach their destination.  Oh, this isn't a good movie, but it's an undeniable watchable and often entertaining one, and I personally liked it more than Star Trek III.
Star Trek VI is the standout, the best movie of the original crew's series.  It delivers the most solid plot of the bunch, good and plentiful action scenes, and a healthy dose of witty repartee.  The ending is very sentimental, but it's welcome, considering this is the end of the journey for our long-running intrepid heroes.",1043712000,3,3344,4.831873905429072

It lacked special features, one of the many features that were supposed to make the DVD stand out above the rest. Although the movies were up to par with the quality and sound expected from a DVD, it still wasn't enough. Star Trek is known for their high tech equipment and the DVD producers didn't even put in deleted scenes or other behind the scene footages except for the first disc, Star Trek the Motion Picture. I was even more dissatisfied when I heard that they were releasing Star Trek movies on DVD again this time with the Special Features that were not included in the box set and have been digitally restored.
