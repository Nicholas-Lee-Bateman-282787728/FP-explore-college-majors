4048384,3,B00317LMAG,Kind of disappointed. It seems my fond memories of the show when it first aired haven't lived up to my expectations as I watch it now.,1356048000,,134,4.1923076923076925
4048385,3,B00317LMAG,I have never seen Garry Shandling's show before. There where parts that were entertaining and there where parts that were not. Bibi hitting on Garry was histerical. But then the episode went down from there. Bibi Beschs' performance was outstanding!!,1355788800,,250,5.275
4048386,5,B00317LMAG,"It's The Garry Shandling Show was the golden age of Shandling's career & Season 1 was the best. Sweet, funny innocence with only slightly naughty jokes from time to time. I'm only sorry the later seasons aren't available for download but the first was the best anyway.",1295136000,,268,4.723404255319149
4048387,5,B00317LMAG,"Garry Shandling gets started here in situation comedy, but he turns the genre upside down in a way that help establish (in 1986) a place for comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld to become legitimate television sit-com personalities. The writing of this show rivals that of Seinfeld, but what has always made this thing click for me is the direct contact with the audience, both in the studio and through the TV screen. His idea of admitting he's doing a television show before a live audience -- showing the audience and even, in one episode, appearing to invite them onto the set of his home while his is on another set. It's pure craziness from the start. Even the theme song is classic. This is a four-disc set that includes some commentary and a few outtakes, as well as an interview with Shandling, post-Larry Sanders. Most definitely worth the price, although I would suggest buying the set containing the entire series.",1271808000,8,922,4.76875

4048402,4,B00317LMAG,All I could say that I remembered about the show was the theme song. With Garry's passing I thought I would give it a try and glad I did.,1459296000,,137,3.7586206896551726

4048408,5,B00317LMAG,"Way ahead of its time in its breaking of the ""Fourth Wall,"" and in looking at television itself in an ironic way. And needless to say, really, really funny. Hard to believe the show is 30 years old (except for the hairstyles).",1459209600,,226,4.404761904761905

4048418,1,B00317LMAG,"Unfortunately does not live up to my memories of the show. I guess the biggest disappointment and reason for the low rating is the damn audience laughter. It sounds like a laugh track and is incredibly loud, way louder than the dialogue from the show. I mean REALLY loud - so distracting and annoying. I don't need and don't want the audiences enhanced laughing to let me know what is funny.  And don't get me started on the ear-splitting clapping which starts off each show when Shandling walks onstage...and seems to last forever. For those reasons alone I can't bring myself to watch anymore beyond the first disk. As for the show itself? It's not bad and is mostly humorous. I like the premise and that Shandling talks to the camera as if we are invisible conspirators? voyeurs? surely not participants? And I would pay extra for a DVD that had the extra loud laughing and clapping edited out. This noise irritation is what keeps me from watching the few sitcoms that might otherwise be watchable.",1432252800,3,1001,4.6875
4048419,5,B00317LMAG,This is one of the most original comedy shows that has ever been on TV. It really holds up well. I was laughing my butt off.,1425254400,,124,3.8076923076923075
4048420,4,B00317LMAG,"This comedy series did not exactly 'tear it up' when first broadcast.  Garry Shandling was(is) an innovative and insightful comic who only really showed his full-qualities when he made his follow-up show: The Larry Sanders Show.  Shandling is a 'New York' type of comedian with that sort of humor and voice.  Now, he's not nearly as ascerbic or controversial as many of that ilk, but he's clearly not from 'Muskogee'.
Some loved the show for its gentle humor, its self-effacing humble host(Shandling), the cast of supporting actors, none of whom were household names then(or ever), etc.  The normal show had Shandling playing a comedian living in the LA area, having funny altercations with his condo-association, the maid, his neighbors, etc.  Every show was well-written with thoughtful, if mild, humor.  In that way, he seemed like a NY type comic, but he was as far from Howard Stern(for example) as was possible.  Well, it was LA, after all, and not New York...",1420070400,,966,4.962732919254658
4048421,5,B00317LMAG,My dad loved this show when it was on tv and was absolutely thrilled to have them on dvd. He's been watching them non-stop!,1419897600,,123,4.166666666666667

4048423,4,B00317LMAG,"Now I have found it and wanted to relive it again.....it would usually play on Sunday nights on FOX, and along with the Tracey Ullman show it was a ritual....Shandling is a very funny guy, one of the greatest comics ever......worth every penny.",1403913600,,244,4.6976744186046515
4048424,4,B00317LMAG,"I recall watching almost every episode of this show on Showtime back in the day and have long since thought about it all these years later. Was great to re-watch some episodes now. The Idea, conception and interpretation of this show has always been a favorite
to use as example of what can be done when actual creative people come together to create something fresh.",1390867200,,367,4.661538461538462
4048425,4,B00317LMAG,"Before Seinfeld, there was Garry Shandling.  This sitcom still holds up today as one of the most inventive, creative and groundbreaking TV shows in history.  It's the classic, ""talk to the viewer"" TV format and no one pulls this off better than Shandling.  While the rest of the cast never plays to the audience, Shandling makes playing both sides of the camera look effortless and easy.  Silly plots make this series even more hysterical.  I have to buy the complete series. Enjoy!",1388448000,3,482,4.829268292682927
4048426,3,B00317LMAG,"If you are a fan of Garry Shandling, this is a must.  Overall, as a sitcom, the episodes are dated and the format (even if very creative in originality) makes them hard to get through at times.  It had its good points and bad.  You won't be throwing away your money, but I would not rank it as a favorite by any means.  Try the Larry Sander's Show instead.",1376524800,,356,4.115942028985507
