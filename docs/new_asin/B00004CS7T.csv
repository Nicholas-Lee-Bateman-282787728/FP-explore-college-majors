7919877,5,B00004CS7T,"This was a splendiforous miniseries that, while it took some liberties historically speaking, was a visual feast.  The acting was excellent as well as the settings. Particularly noteworthy was the musical score by Bill Conti of ROCKY, DYNASTY, JAMES BOND, FALCON CREST, NORTH AND SOUTH, THE COLBYS, THE KARATE KID, ETC. fame.  Neither a DVD nor CD of this miniseries has been released and this is really a tragedy for those who love this kind of spectacle.  Will someone PLEASE rectify this situation.",1307750400,6,501,5.0120481927710845
7919878,5,B00004CS7T,"This beautiful rendition of Napoleon and Josephine Love Story has been totally forgotten to be released in DVD-format, since 1987 when it was shown on TV as two-part miniseries. Since then, the French has stolen the show by releasing Napoleon in 2001, a more complete history on the rise and fall of Napoleon. Though, I still prefer the TV mini-series Production, with Armand Assante and Jacqueline Bisset over the french's Isalebella Rossellini and Christian Xavier?
Thorn-Birds, The Winds of War, War and Remembrance, Lonesome Dove, etc. have all been released in DVD-format, please consider releasing Napoleon & Josephine,a Love Story for cherished fans.",1276732800,16,657,5.388349514563107
7919879,4,B00004CS7T,"This sumptuously-produced 4-hours-plus miniseries, featuring Armand Assante and Jacqueline Bisset in the title roles (with supporting performances by Stephanie Beacham, among others) is one of these movies that are, much to the frustration of classic video fans, still unavailable on any form of home video in the U.S. even decades after their release. It's very much to be hoped that, now that the various ""vault"" series such as Warner Brothers' and Universal's are finally releasing long-neglected movies and miniseries on DVD, this one - like, for example, ""Lace"" and ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"" - will finally get its long-overdue release on DVD.",1272240000,12,648,5.362745098039215
