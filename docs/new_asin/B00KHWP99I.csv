6429718,5,B00KHWP99I,"The film is well paced and constantly engaging.  It provides a unique prespective compared to other gmo films I've seen.  It gives a human face to the struggle of organic farmers as it touches upon on their ongoing legal struggles against agro-giants, corporations with limitless resources and which seemingly are attempting to take exclusive ownership of this world heritage (the seed).  It also highlights our spiritual connection to seeds, without which human-kind would not exist.",1449446400,,484,5.426666666666667
6429719,5,B00KHWP99I,Amazing and very informative about our relationship with our vast relationship with farming and sustainability.,1446854400,,111,6.466666666666667
6429720,5,B00KHWP99I,"What can I say,  information well needed and well received.
What we need to know is how to go about growing our own and where to find the NON gmo seeds.",1443657600,,152,3.903225806451613
6429721,5,B00KHWP99I,One of my favorite book about stuff we should all be aware of,1434844800,,61,3.769230769230769
6429722,5,B00KHWP99I,"they should show this in every school in the world! so sad to see what big money is doing to our world all for the sake of the all mighty dollar. this is so important, to understand our food chain. I was sitting in a heartbroken stupor when the movie was over, people just don't understand how important seeds are. if we want to eat, I guess they are kinda important!",1428969600,3,367,4.183098591549296
6429723,5,B00KHWP99I,"Excellent, powerful, moving film about the importance of saving seeds.  Starts with reasons why we need to do it, and is very hopeful about the future of seed diversity.  Important film to watch if you enjoy eating food!  We can impact the future of our world's seed diversity by choosing to eat non-GMO foods!",1427414400,,310,4.703703703703703
6429724,5,B00KHWP99I,"Truly scary that as a Nation our Food System is controlled by Big Pharma, Big Ag and Corporate Greed.  It's sickening that our Elected Officials are allowing this to happen all for Corporate Profits.  This Nation is so unhealthy and it isn't because we are all sitting behind our laptops, iPhones and whatever Electronic Gadget is in Vogue at the moment.  It's our Food and all of the Chemicals used to make it.  Real wake up call.",1426464000,3,431,4.558441558441558
6429725,5,B00KHWP99I,"Wow - powerful and positive film!  From the get-go my attention was captured. So many issues with my food and our it's sources. I thought I knew everything but didn't realize I had so little knowledge. As I loved watching the characters, these issues were clearly explained and detailed. This great achievement of a film was fun and so heartfelt. Everyone who ever eats food from a supermarket (ugh... all of us?) needs to watch this film.",1423872000,8,439,4.701298701298701
6429726,5,B00KHWP99I,"This is a wonderfully unique film that illuminates what is at stake... and what can be done... to protect the source of nearly all our food seeds.

From fabrics to food to fuels, seeds are essential to life. Unfortunately, corporations including the likes of Monsanto are co-opting seed genetics and hiding behind patent law in the process. This is a major issue not only in the US, but across the globe, and while other films address the legal issues, Open Sesame takes a good stab at the history providing a great basis of thought.

Open Sesame looks at the extraordinary challenges that seeds face. Not only is our food supply at risk along with the torrent of heath issues that follow, but the process is threatening our farms.

You will meet a diverse range of individuals whose lives center around seeds. Farmers, renegade gardeners, passionate seed savers, artists and activists all who work to plant the seeds of information and inspiration within this film that tells the story of one of our most precious resources. Open Sesame is an emotional film directed by the passionate, award-winning filmmaker Sean Kaminsky. It seeks to shed light on the dire implications of seed privatization. according to Foodtank

Open Sesame features:
Vandana Shiva, Author, Environmentalist
William Woys Weaver, Author, Food Historian
Bill McDorman, Co-founder of SaveSeed.org, Educator
Gary Nabhan, Agricultural Ecologist, Ethnobotanist
Diane Ott Whealy, Co Founder of Seed Saver Exchange
Ken Greene, Founder, Hudson Valley Seed Library

An eye-opener about a subject so close to our lives that we can barely see it...",1418947200,7,1610,5.176923076923077
6429727,5,B00KHWP99I,"Finally, a really well thought out documentary on the necessity of seed diversity. It's not a rant against GMO (although GMO problems are certainly featured) as much as it is a look at what happens when monoculture farming practices eradicate biodiversity and leave our food supply system in great peril. It's a wake up call, a call to action, and recommended viewing for anyone who cares remotely about a sustainable system of agriculture (read food supply).",1418083200,13,459,5.052631578947368
8659071,1,B00KHWP99I,"None of the folks evaluating the science in this film are scientists. The vast majority of scientific evidence (and accredited scientists in this country and others) don't subscribe to this hype. Bottom line: if you believe global warming is real, it's because there vast majority of scientific evidence says it is... the vast majority of scientific also says the process of genetic engineering is safe... science doesn't lie, or have an agenda... It's simply following the evidence. This film doesn't actually look at the meta-data, or the vast majority of what plant science says about the safety of the genetic engineering process. Neil Degrasse made a film about GMOs, and he is trained as a scientist.. go check it his stuff, or Bill Nyes GMO stuff... Ironically, science says the exact opposite of what this film says.",1504915200,,824,5.021897810218978
8659072,5,B00KHWP99I,"I knew a little bit about the whole GMO thing but I had no idea the depth and intensity of the struggle, the dangers and the corrosive and insidious nature of modern agriculture. The Europeans call our food Frankenfood. Now I see it's with very good reason. Red claxons should be going off in all our heads over this subject rather than the mass complacency we are currently suffering from. This issue is having serious consequences. This GMO, pesticide, herbicide, artificial fertilizer thing is destroying the living topsoil, totally out of hand and I believe, is causing immense harm to society. No wonder there are so many stark raving mad people nowadays: our food is poisoned cr*p!

This story is told quite convincingly by and from the point of view of the 'rabble' (and I mean this with all affection)- That is, the small farmer, gardener and the whole food and heirloom seed enthusiasts. Some of them seem rather over-emotional but they do make a very compelling case. Today's rabble is tomorrow's power structure. I would like to hear the point of view of the corporate giants but I cannot imagine that this whole situation is very much different from the years long struggle between the tobacco companies and those opposing their poisonous products.

Good film. I am going to watch it a couple of more times to tease every bit of information from its frames. There is a lot there and it is a VERY important and RELEVANT issue.",1498262400,,1437,4.744
8659073,5,B00KHWP99I,"Gone unchecked, individuals tend to enrich themselves at the expense of the greater good.  One iteration of this fundamental truth is the American agricultural industrial complexs rapacious effort to maximize profit at the expense of human health.

This movie shows us a better alternative  the countervailing force mercifully found within the human condition  people working hard to mutually benefit one another, all of us striving to serve the greater good.",1474243200,,459,5.514285714285714

8659075,5,B00KHWP99I,Wow!!! What an important documentation.  Everyone should watch this.  It is a cause we all need to step up and support!,1464739200,,119,4.619047619047619
8659076,4,B00KHWP99I,"Recommend this to anyone who eats food! Authentic information from actual organic farmers. An inside look into how certain commercial seed producers value profit and power over quality of life and continue to attempt to ""patent"" mother nature. However, even more eye opening and powerful, is how a grass roots movement of caring, dedicated people, is making monumental strides in creating access for everyone to food that promotes physical health and social and economic well being. This is an important record of this point in our history.",1461110400,,540,5.218390804597701
8659077,2,B00KHWP99I,"I have been looking for a real program concerning genetic diversity in plants(and other living things) and I have ended up disappointed every time. This is a very narrow one sided view that is very negative. Real life scientists will tell us that there is no way that the worlds human population could be fed if seeds and crops had not been developed by scientific methods in the last 200 years. In the area that I live in wheat is a very important crop...and I know that production per acre has at least doubled because of seed science. The wheat is not nearly so tall and now it doesn't collapse every time the weather isn't perfect. The length of the seed head is much greater than it was and wheat is much more tolerant to lack of moisture. You can take any crop from 100 yrs ago and find numerous things wrong with everything that was grown. We have developed shorter growing seasons, better keeping, products more suited for specific uses, disease resistant, etc.

I know that the situation is not perfect and that the laws probably developed in some wrong directions. There has to be a way to protect the genetic  availability so that those genes can be studied and used in the future. There has been piecemeal development of those laws over a very long period of time and they don't apply properly to todays situation or dangers. It is past time to study and rewrite those laws properly.

I have also grown tired of having only the negatives promoted by people who did not accept change...Protestors and women crying at their individual misfortunes and situations will not truly define the answers needed. We must develop the ability to accept change and to also preserve the needed history and diversity of genetics. Just attacking mindlessly is not the answer.",1460419200,,1770,4.684887459807074
8659078,4,B00KHWP99I,very informative. it was much better then i thought it would be.,1458950400,,64,4.416666666666667
8659079,5,B00KHWP99I,great info,1452470400,,10,4.5
8659080,2,B00KHWP99I,"As a plant and soil scientist, and an aspiring organic farmer, I wanted to like this film.  I was hoping it would have much more about the science of seeds and history of seed saving and benefits of propagation.  However, I found it too long, too disjointed, and short on usable information.  I admit I felt impatient watching people wax rhapsodic and get emotional over seeds.  I was also disappointed that even though Vandana Shiva has top billing in promotional materials, she barely appears in the film.  All that said, it is a 'nice' film on an important topic and I'm sure some people will get a lot out of it. However, if like me, you feel you have a reasonable understanding of the issues at stake, and you're interested in practical, science-based information on seed saving and its benefits, I can't recommend it.",1449705600,6,823,4.6875
