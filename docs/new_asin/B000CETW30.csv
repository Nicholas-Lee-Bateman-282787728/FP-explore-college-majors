2462192,5,B000CETW30,I started using the techniques as I was reading and re-reading this book.  I am constantly referring back to it for different techniques.  I have recommended this to many others.  My book looks well read.,1280361600,3,204,4.771428571428571
2462193,5,B000CETW30,"I have Eden's videotapes and the Essential techniques DVD as well. But this one is the best one so far because watching the live demo is so much more entertaining.
Obviously this live seminar was professionally taped so sound and visual are top notch, the best so far. Its hard to believe that a live seminar could be this smooth and excellent but she does so many road appearances that she is a master at her technique.
I reccommend watching this DVD first and then getting the Essential Techniques for step by step learning of each technique.
Energy Medicine should be given in hospitals post-op as she suggests, taught in schools to kids, and should be mandatory training in all medical and nursing education. It is a free simple method that anyone can do.
Especially useful for anyone with energy depletion, learning disabilities, neglect, cognitive, public speaking or anxiety/phobia issues.",1236470400,33,896,4.98

Their series of books and companion DVDs are easy for the beginner to advanced enthusiasts  to cover the Energy Medicine field.

2462195,5,B000CETW30,"I do energy healing for a living, and I love Donna's work. It is both illuminating and practical, and she delivers the information with her trademark joy and sparkle.

I ordered this DVD as part of her introductory package - it came with the book (which I had already read a couple of times) and the 3-DVD set the first reviewer hopes has more to it. (Well - it IS 6 hours instead of 2, so I should hope so! And please note that the 3-DVD set is explicitly a COMPANION to her ""Energy Medicine"" book, so make sure you read that first, or you really can't evaluate it properly.)

Before I saw the Intro DVD, I had already read the book twice, and I had seen the 6-hour DVD set. In addition, I had already watched and used her ""Medicine Kit"" CD/DVD/Card set. I almost didn't bother watching the Intro DVD because, hey, it was only 2 hours, what could it tell me that I didn't already know about the basics of her work?

I decided to watch it basically because I enjoy listening to Donna Eden.

Am I ever glad I did! Not only did I learn new ways of working with some of her techniques, it was a fabulous experience watching this straightforward, down-to-earth and yet tremendously charismatic healer introduce her work. Her explanations and demos were clear, practical and very user-friendly.

I would give this DVD 6 stars if I could! (But Amazon won't let me... ;-D)",1200528000,85,1365,4.422310756972111
2462196,5,B000CETW30,"This video is an INTRODUCTION with that said...an overview is given....with some tidbits of information.

Donna Eden's program technique, from what I gather, is given in step by step increments.  And I appreciate this because you are not OVERWHELMED with too much information.

Purchase her Energy Medicine Kit to start off... then the Intro DVD and then the 6 hour dvd... work your way up... There is SO MUCH information to absorb!

This video is not a waste of money.

It gives you tips that you can use immediately on yourself and even on loved ones.

After that taste then you move forward....

Donna Eden is a blessing to humanity...helping us to reconnect to that which is innate and natural... and tap into Energy flow that is ALL AROUND US.....

If you want to be swamped with massive amounts of information then of course this dvd is not for you.

If you want a step by step starting at ground zero info and intro to help support you along the way then this dvd and the rest of her learning series is for you.

A journey of knowledge and information begins with one step at a time.
Just for today.....",1199318400,49,1110,4.505
2462197,1,B000CETW30,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE. I would rate this DVD zero stars but the Amazon website won't let me apparently so I have to give it one star.

I purchased this DVD since it is a tape of a real 2 hour conference session. What a major disappointment. It teaches you nothing. Donna talks about Chakras and meridians but just barely explains what they are or why they are important. She shows no graphs to help explain anything about the theory of energy flow, blockages, etc. She merely performs what I consider to be parlor tricks and gives little to no explanation what is really happening. For example, she talks about how a person's energy can be 'twisted' and demonstrates a way to 'untwist' it but she doesn't explain what 'twisted energy' means, why it's bad, or why it needs to be fixed by this technique.

Do yourself a favor and save your money. This DVD is not worth it. I regret buying it. I also bought, her 3 CD set called ""Energy Healing with Donna Eden"". If it is 3 CDS of more of the same lack of real information of energy healing I will be very mad indeed.",1190678400,38,1080,4.315270935960591
2462228,4,B000CETW30,This was the beinging DVD to the Energy Medicine I reviewed earlier.  I bought this DVD to check out what was going on with the Energy Medicine and then bought the whole learning DVD to practice more and learn more indepth practices.,1400284800,,233,4.5476190476190474
2462229,4,B000CETW30,"Yes, you learn from Donna I would like to see better filming, but Donna's material is well worth the video quality. She offers a lot of material for her audience.",1389830400,,162,4.433333333333334
2462230,5,B000CETW30,Wow!! Excellent! Donna Eden along with her husband provide 2 hours of generous and clear information on how to implement energy work into your life. I highly recommend their work as I've experienced results.,1381104000,,207,5.117647058823529

2462234,3,B000CETW30,"I have Donna Eden's book Energy Medicine and really love that, so I bought this dvd to see in person how she performs the meridian tests.  It was obviously taped several (several) years ago.  Judging by the clothes and hairstyles of the audience probably in the 80's.  I was hoping this would be more updated.  I bought this as an introductory dvd because I was planning on purchasing ""The Essential Techniques"" which is quite a bit more, and now I'm hesitant to purchase that because of the quality of this dvd.  She is an amazing lady and so full of life and light, however the dvd was disappointing in its quality.  I was so disheartened that I didn't finish it.  However, I do think if you ignore the aesthetic cons, the material is good, which is why I still gave it 3 stars.",1356739200,4,780,4.4125874125874125
2462235,4,B000CETW30,"After reading one reviewer, I was mislead thinking it was a 6 hour program. It is not.
It is however a good companion to the book as with the book some of the exercises were unclear to me. With the dvd you are shown how to do them. Probably should be included in a package with the book.
 Donna is a good instructor and found lots of good info in the book.",1318982400,5,356,3.9444444444444446
2462236,5,B000CETW30,"Wow, I was so mesmerized by Donna Eden in this video...she gave so much information in this CD and her husband, David Feinstein was a valuable addition to this introduction.  I will enjoy this more and more each time I watch this as well as gain great insight.  Thank you so much for providing this quality of instruction.",1298505600,5,322,4.5344827586206895
2462237,5,B000CETW30,"I am not a professional energy healer, yet when I was healed by a healer, I developed a passion for the subject, and use energy healing techniques on myself all the time, and even attend seminars occasionally.  And each different discipline has taught me something new and important.  Whether it be Reiki, Quantum Touch, Qi Gong or Matrix Energetics, Touch for health.

With Donna Eden there are so many different techniques you can use, you may wonder where to even start.  If you are relatively new to Energy Medicine this review will hopefully point you in the right direction.

I already own several of Donna Eden's products, in fact most of them.  If you are like me, you need to see the process in action to get the full understanding.  There is nothing like seeing a particular technique demonstrated.  When she talks thumping certain energy points and tracing meridians, it's better to see it demonstrated rather than explained in a book. On the other hand in the book, the explanation and content are sufficient in and of themselves.

I liked this particular dvd, although the first time I looked at it, her very right brained presenting style threw me for a loop, and when her husband stepped in occasionally to offer his contribution, this suited my particular style better. The introduction to energy medicine mini seminar is a  two hour plus workshop she does all over the world with husband David Feinstein, where attendees are invited up, and she assesses what needs to be done and then does it.

When I looked at the dvd again I was amazed at how she can do what she does. She can see energy, but you can  model what she does through energy testing.  In fact I have used zip up affirmations for years after getting the energy medicine kit, and I energy test myself quiet often.

After getting this dvd I noticed she was doing a workshop in the Bay Area, and so I signed up.  About 300 people packed a church in Palo Alto, and in person she comes across even better than on the dvd.  Years of presenting have tightly honed her presentation skills.  Even though she was doing a seminar at Esalen that weekend, she made no mention of it.  Usually, presenters will attempt to roll you over into their next seminar. Rollovers is the name of the game. My respect levels skyrocketed when this did not happen.

She worked on a girl with depression, and did cross over exercises, and the whole audience joined in. This was pretty impressive.  On the dvd she worked on getting someone to read and her husband energy testing some 4 attendees, who clearly lost energy as he started to read.  This was a quick fix on the reader by making him read backwards, which she also did in the Palo Alto workshop.

So, I recommend this product, after you have bought The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Energy-Medicine-Kit/dp/B0009PQG36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Energy Medicine Kit</a>, and either the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Energy-Medicine-Balancing-Your-Body-s-Energies-for-Optimal-Health-Joy-and-VitalityUpdated-and-Expanded/dp/1585426504/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Energy Medicine: Balancing Your Body's Energies for Optimal Health, Joy, and VitalityUpdated and Expanded</a>&nbsp;book, or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Energy-Medicine-for-Women-Aligning-Your-Body-s-Energies-to-Boost-Your-Health-and-Vitality/dp/1585426474/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Energy Medicine for Women: Aligning Your Body's Energies to Boost Your Health and Vitality</a>&nbsp;or both.  The Kit contains a pendulum, a booklet,  a dvd, an audio cd and a crystal pendulum.  The kit also contains the five minute daily routine while this dvd does not.  I consider the five minute routine an essential technique. I have also reviewed both these products.

I recommend the kit first, and the book second, or get both together.

Interestingly enough, at the workshop, among all the Donna Eden products, I saw an energy medicine book by another author, which sparked my curiosity.  I thought, if this book is recommended by Donna Eden, it must be pretty good.  It was one of the best energy healing books I have read. It was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Emotion-Code/dp/0979553709/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Emotion Code</a>.
