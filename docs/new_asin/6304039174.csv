783954,5,6304039174,"I'm a big fan of the first Father of the Bride movie, and this sequel didn't disappoint me.  It was great to see all of the actors from the original movie reprise their roles, so it really felt as if you were  following the Banks-Mackenzie clan throughout all of their life events.  The plot is, admittedly, rather predictable, but the movie is done in such  a way that it is still charming and endearing.  This movie has a great  ""feel-good"" theme and has wonderful underlying family values,  just as the first ""Father of the Bride"".  I can't wait for a  third movie!",949622400,2,568,4.490196078431373
783955,5,6304039174,"This is film making at it`s best. A combination of ideally suitable actors and a great storyline make this hilarious tale a joy to watch. Steve Martin is brilliant as George Banks,the ""cheapest man alive"" trying to  cope with both his wife and daughter`s pregnancies, and Diane Keaton is  superb in her support role. All of the other actors add to the humour and  sentimentality, and Martin Short must recieve a special mention for his  performance as Frank Eggelhoffer. The end of the film when the babies are  born is always a tear-jerking moment, and the sountrack throughout is  spectacular. Even better than the excellent prequel-When is ""Father of  the Bride Part 3"" coming out!",948499200,2,684,4.895652173913043
783956,5,6304039174,"Steve Martin brigns humor to the screen reprising his role of george Banks,hapless tight-wad trying to recuporate from Part 1 wedding. He sees his life settling down-Daughter married and sucessful, house ""fully  paid for"",and son Matty (Kieran Culkin) growing up before his eyes. I  think this is a great movie. Kieran is excellent and should have a long and  sucessful career. Steve Martin is always funny.",943315200,,407,5.136363636363637
783957,5,6304039174,"This movie was the best! it's about a man who finds out that his daughter,Annie is pregnent and then find's out that his wife,Nina is pregnent too. AND it's only natural that the babies get born on the same  night.it's so good.",943315200,,227,4.404761904761905

784240,4,6304039174,"A perfect example of a movie that doesn't quite capture the magic of the original but succeeds because of it's lovable cast. The movie definitely feels a little less ""organic"" than the first one with the mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time as somewhat of an odd concept to wrap your mind around. The jokes feel a little forced at times, but honestly who the hell cares? You can't help but root for these characters and all in all it's a worthy sequel to a classic film.",1504396800,,485,4.4

784243,5,6304039174,"Funny and entertaining. Great cast. Even though this is an older movie, it is recommended for a night away from the crazy world we are living in. It is a perfect escape movie with lots of laughs. I love Steve Martin and as usual, he is hysterical and sensitive in his role.

One recommendation - It's not necessary, but I'd watch the first Father of the Bride before this one for continuity.

ENJOY your movie night!

785350,4,6304039174,"Father of the Bride 2 is a perfect cure for the doldrums.  My wife and I had never seen this movie.  One evening after a particularly tough day, she saw this DVD on our shelves and suggested that we watch it.  She hit play and the night changed.  After several hours (we always get interrupted with pseudo emergencies when watching a movie) we slowly felt the tension leave and laughter began to replace the gloom.

Father of the Bride 2 stars Steve Martin as George Banks.  George has recovered from the nerve racking experience of hosting a wedding for his daughter Anne (Kimberly Williams), and is finally ready to get on with his life.  Suddenly Anne announces that she is having a baby and George immediately has a mid life crisis.
George rejects the concept of being a grandfather, spurns his age.  He tries to gain control of his life by planning to move to the seashore, and remaking his personal  appearance.  George's mid life crisis is hilarious, his actions are exaggerated, almost childish but very funny.

Then his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) announces she is pregnant and the fun really begins.  George becomes unglued, Nina resents his attitude, and George discovers that his crisis is self inflicted.

This is a very fun filled movie.  Steve Martin is at his best.  Both Diane Keaton and Kimberly Williams are brilliant in their roles as the wife and daughter.  As a generous addition, Martin Short plays a huge roll as planner of baby showers, interior decorator who remodels houses, and a zany supporter for George.

I highly recommend this film for anyone wanting a funny enjoyable evening.",1306886400,3,1607,4.785454545454545
785473,5,6304039174,"In this movie sequel to ""Father of the Bride"", George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the comfortable family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a catalyst for a kind of rebirth of his attitude on life when he and his wife, Nina, find how their lives are about to change as well. This movie is a very warm and funny family movie. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny.

When they are in the hallway of the hospital once Nina finds out that she is expecting it is very funny! I have watched parts I and II several times and am very happy that they are part of my dvd collection. They truly don't make too many films of this genre anymore, unfortunately. The cast is terrific and it's just a great movie to share with the whole family, even grandparents! No unexpected suprises or bad language. Would highly recommend!",1261353600,,756,4.607407407407408

785481,4,6304039174,"This film is funnier than the first.  Given the subject of becoming a grandfather, and a dad again at the same time, this gives Steve Martin the chance to really cut loose - and he does!

Throw in a little bit of a mid-life crisis and you have a wonderful comedy!",1217203200,,263,4.137254901960785
785594,5,6304039174,"I just finished watching this movie last night and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a great movie for the entire family!  This is perhaps the best movie rental I have seen this year.

I have followed the career of Steve Martin since the 1970's.  His comedy routine was really over the top in terms of his nightclub and television presentation.  Lots of sight gags and exaggerated funny stories.  I guess I expected the same sort of humor from this movie and fortunately, was I wrong.  Instead, Martin has a genius for a very suble humor that is absolutely hilarious.  I laughed out loud and actually fell on the floor laughing in one scene.

A well-done movie should make you laugh, cry, and think.  This movie does it all.  Watch it with someone you love, and just see the emotions this movie evokes.  It has something for every age and is not offensive whatsoever.  I congratulate the producers for giving the American public a film that the entire family can appreciate and be entertained by.

This movie immediately rocketed to the top of my ""funniest movie ever"" category.  And it is because I could relate to the situations presented, the feelings of the characters, and the inherent humor in the lives of the characters.

Yet, this movie is not just a comedy.  It is a coming of age movie for baby-boomers, and for twenty-somethings.  It made me laugh out loud, evokes copious tears many times, and made me think about what is really important in life.  The core message of the film is that family and relationships are what makes life worth living.  Steve Martin (as George), has a telling moment at the hospital as both his wife and his daughter are about to deliver at the same time.  Martin turns to the young female doctor and says, ""Doctor, these two women are my entire life"".  (In other words, I love them so much; don't let anything happen to them!). That one line is the essence of the film, and life in general.

Diane Keaton's smile is so lovely, and she is the perfect foil for the serious George (Steve Martin).  There is quality in every aspect of this film.  The supporting cast is exceptional, with Martin Short's characterization of the obviously gay wedding/baby shower planner a sure laugh producer!

This is a 5-star movie in my book.  I love the sets, the background music, the acting, - everything!  Most highly recommended!  Please Hollywood producers, give us more movies like this!

785602,1,6304039174,"I was very disappointed in this movie. As much as I love Steve Martin, this movie just didn't do anything for me. I had to make myself watch it in its entirety. It was too unrealistic; a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time, giving birth on the same exact day, in the same hospital across the hall from one another. Give me a break. And what are the chances of you buying your house back one day after you sell it by just one stoke of a pen by simply reaching into your pocket and whipping out a $100,000 check? Yeah, I see that happen all the time. And gee whiz, Annie's husband walks into the hospital after a business trip in Tokyo just in the nick of time, how convenient. And is it too much to ask to have just one movie where the pregnant woman gets a normal ride to the hospital? The wild ride to the hospital scene is played (Look Who's Talking?, Nine Months). And just what kind of job did the father of the bride have? A baby suite? How fortunate we all would be if we could toss thousands of dollars on a single room in a house that's only going to be used for a couple of months. Now that's what I call living! And Franck, not only does he coordinate weddings but he throws in baby showers here and there as well. Oh, and he also designs baby suites. Maybe he does barmitzvahs too. This movie would have been a lot better if it only focused on Annie being pregnant. The Banks having 3 children spread out across 3 different generations was a bit much. ""Is that your grandbaby?"" ""No, that's my daughter."" ""Hey, is that your sister?"" ""No, that's my aunt."" ""Hey, it was nice meeting your brother."" ""Are you kidding me, that's my nephew!""  There were no funny moments in this movie and seeing Steve Martin as a brunette, even if it was only briefly, was just painful. His hair has been gray ever since I can remember and he should keep it that way at all times. Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie. The first one is much better. If I could have given it a zero star I would have. Sorry Steve, I still love you but the next time I want to see you in a good movie, I'll just pull out ""The Jerk"",""Parenthood"" or ""Housesitter"". As a matter of fact, I'm planning to take this movie to the Thrift store the next time I donate.",1160524800,4,2250,4.172413793103448

This movie, and the original remake (since that's what these films are) tell a lot of lies about what people should expect life to be.  Therefore, they are not fun.  All the humor evaporates when you realize it is attempting to tell you ""your life should be this way"" or you're wrong if it is not.

785797,4,6304039174,"In my normal physical state, I adore this movie.  Mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time is an interesting story, and the entire original cast returned in top form.  Martin Short lit up the screen brilliantly as the eccentric perfectionist Franck, and Steve Martin was hysterical in portraying the over-protective father who suddenly has to deal with two newly pregnant women...his daughter and his wife!  The movie is predictable but entertaining and will leave you with a nice warm fuzzy at the end.

 In my pregnant states, however, this movie is barely stomachable.  It's just too ""charmed"" to be any form of realistic.  An entry-level architect being offered a position on a design team for a Boston museum?  Laughable.  An unmedicated woman in labor barely making a sound and laughing about how happy she is that her husband arrived at the last possible second?  Absurd!  It is unknown how much money the Bank's and MacKenzie's make, however it's also unreasonable to expect that a newlywed couple starting out would be consistently surrounded by designer everything.  It's also obnoxiously unrealistic to see a man who constantly complains about money to suddenly pop out a check for $100,000, and still pay for a designer double baby shower and a home remodel!  (particularly since at the beginning, he says he ""just finished paying off"" Annie's $200,000 wedding.  However he still had roughly that much to drop on the previous three items?)

The overly-charmed aspect of the movie is the only reason I give it four instead of five stars.",1142640000,3,1559,4.988372093023256

I did not see the first ""Father of the Bride"" movie, but it was obvious that experience wasn't necessary.  Thank god!

Whereas there are some comical moments, it just seems like the pacing of the film is oh so identical to the original.  Just as Mrs Banks announces her pregancy, Franc is on the scene to plan another baby shower.  And a double one at that to honor Kimberly William's character.  The scenes just become to off the wall an the repetitive false alarms add very little to the story.

Nonetheless, Steve Martin and Martin Short are very entertaining.  The wrecking ball scene with Mr. Habib is priceless.  Not quite the original but  Father of the Bride 2 certainly rates as amusing.",1101686400,,782,4.521428571428571
785801,3,6304039174,"It took me ages watching certain movies to realise where I actually knew Martin Short from. Of course he's Franck, and he will have you in tears with the kinda stuff he comes out with! Some classics that you can just barely understand with such an accent are:

Franck: Father of the bride and a baby? GET OUT OF TOWN.

Franck: What planet? The planet of not wanting to die by a drive by shooting.

I had to virtually wrestle this back into my DVD case and out of my mum's hands. She loves both of these films, and complained a lot about me not having the first one on DVD yet. Is it my fault that the DVD store in Edinburgh as the second one for 6.99, and the first for lots dearer?! Grrrr, I'll get it eventually, although no doubt this DVD and Cheaper By The Dozen will go missing at points, or be put back in the wrong place by my mother! She'd better keep her hands off.

I love this movie too, but the grand finale is much better done in Nine Months, with Robin Williams as the Russian Doctor. Speaking of Robin Williams, how much does Steve Martin look like his when he dyes his hair brown?! They're practically twins!

Most of this film is predictable, as is its predecessor, but Martin Short shines, and you get almost teary when he helps out with Nina & Annie giving birth. He's fabulous in these movies, and the accent has to be heard to be believed! You will be crying with tears over the accent.

There's no extras on this DVD, not even a trailer - sacriledge!

This is a great movie to add to your collection, and believe me, Franck's character is definitely brilliant! It's a fun movie, but have some sympathy for me, trying to keep it away from my mum!",1100131200,3,1667,4.256329113924051

It's very much like Alan Alda's A NEW LIFE because George Banks(Steve Martin) like Alda in his film,becomes a grandfather and a father again. George drives home from his company Sidekicks on a beautiful fall day(cool air and gradually falling multi-colored leaves). At the Banks' home,where Bryan MacKenzie's(George Newbern) parents David and Joanna were also,George,Nina(Diane Keaton),David and Joanna learn,when their respective children show up,that Annie(Kimberly williams) and Bryan will become parents. Annie's brother Matt(Kieran Culkin) learns also. George gets a makeover in one scene(he dyes his hair). He surprises his wife Nina,saying ""I look like the guy you married!"". Also he presents some sexy lingerie to Nina,which she refuses since she is a grandmother-to-be(""Hey,you're not my grandmother!"",George quipps.). The lingerie led to an unexpected preganancy for Nina,which is her third. The Bankses experience some faults with their house. George and Nina agreed to sell it if something else went wrong. So termites attacked,and on the real estate market the Bankses' house at 24 Maple Drive in San Marino,California,went. The new owner had not yet closed and sent a bulldozer with a wrecking ball to demolish the house. George decides to take the house back(""Don't destroy my memories!""). He tells the wrecking crew how he painted the shutters of the Banks' home and accidentally broke a window with a flying frisbee. So the ""new owner"" sends the wrecking crew away,bringing relief to George. Around the same time,George's and Nina's third child and Annie's and Bryan's child are born in the very same hospital. At a clinic,George and Nina run into Franc Eggelhoffer,the same European guy who coordinated Annie's wedding. Franc(Martin Short) learns of Nina's and Annie's respective pregnancies(""modder and dodder prognont togodder?"",as pronounced by Franc). So Nina and Annie have a baby shower together.

He's married, has one daughter who is married (the story of which was brought forward in the original Father of the Bride), and has a son.  Now that his daughter is married, Martin thinks that he can finally start from scratch with his wife and move to a condo.  It turns out that just isn't going to happen.
Why?
Well, during a celebration of his renewed independence--it turns out that he inpregnates his wife, and thus he is going to be a father.  It's a bit shocking to him, but it happens.  So lo and behold, his daughter and wife are both pregnant.  The story from there showcases what love and respect he has for both of them.  Although it was intended as comedy, it is not a ha-ha laughter type of film.  I just couldn't laugh at most moments.  Yet, the film is an important indication of why every culture really values the family: there is some joy about being so close-knit together, even in times of crisis.

Until Annie announces she's going to have a baby. George Banks? A grandfather? He always knew that Bryan was up to no good - he, for one thing, is too young to be a grandfather!

Throw in Frunk the weird wedding coordinator and his assistant Howard, Bryan's parents and their ""lovable"" dogs, and you get a movie as hilarious as the first one: there's just the right amount of references to the first movie to be funny but not to bore the viewer as a typically boring sequel... Unfortunately, the structure of the movie is very similar to the first one's (including Annie & Bryan fighting at around the same time in the story line), which made it feel a little repetitive.",1024099200,2,1218,4.466367713004484
785948,3,6304039174,"You never know how a sequal will go to a movie, but in this case it's always wonderful when the entire original cast comes back. And that's what happened in this case.
This goes into more detail with The Banks Family and also with the MacKenzie clan.
It starts off with Kimberly Williams character, as Annie Banks becoming pregnant, and with Steve Martin's character returning as George Banks, who then feels really old after he learns of his daughter's pregnancy and the fact he's becoming a grandpa. So then he spends half of the film trying to become young again. There's also the fact that they try to sell their house, the classic lovely house from the first film...and also Nina not feeling very well and then feeling old herself. However, this is the kicker, then she becomes pregnant as well at the same time her daughter is. That's where it gets to be a little ""out there."" This time around the film is more about growing up and learning to cope with the responsibilties of parent hood. The movie though I do have to say is really touching and has a lot of fun moments. Especially and not to worry, Martin Short comes back as the very funny and histarical Franck Eggelhoffer. (I had to look that name up :) Martin and Steve Martin paired together make a wonderful comedy team. Also in this one it's also touching to see to characters so different, Franck and George bond together with the births of Georges baby and his daughter's baby. This film is a little more out there, a little more slow, but it is a classic comedy and I love how everyone returned. You can tell the entire cast loved to work together which is always fun to see. All in all I think you'll enjoy this film.
For the DVD it has more than the first one does. It's still in Widescreen formate, but it also has more trailers, a great behind the scene's commentary with Steve Martin and Martin Short where they kind of interview themselves its funny! And of course it has the different language selections so its a better DVD then the first one.

Steve Martin and everybody else from the original return as we find out that daughter(Kimberly Williams)is pregnant with child. Everybody is overjoyed. Then, the unthinkable happens. Mrs. Banks(Diane Keaton) learns that she is expecting too!. That storyline deals a lot with the ages of these characters. They are going to have their first grandchild, and, at the same time, are going to have a new child of their own. There are many funny scenes that deal with that issue. Soome of them are very poignant as well. Steve Martin is a charming class act all the way. He's teriffic. Martin Short returns as wedding coordinator Franc. He's now on board to decorate the new baby's room. The movie has that same lovely visuals like the first. The great street, lovely house. It's a nice film. The great Eugene Levy pop ups as well. This is one sweet little movie. A part 3 would be very welcome. If you don't like nice, warm, happy movies, then stay far away from this. If you just like movies, you will. Some people hate movies like this because they are nice. I think it's a sad world we live in if some people have to bash a film simply because it's a nice movie. That's pretty pathetic.

Even if you bid it farewell, it won't go away. but I respect your opinion,even if it may not sound like it.  On with the movie review. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Most sequels are boring and terrible, but this one really followed up with the first one. The fact that all of the characters were back from the first movie really helped. And how many movies have this kind of plot? Have you ever heard of another movie with a mother and daughter getting pregnant at the same time? And Martin's character, George Banks, was a really sweet man to be able to help out both his wife and daughter at the same time, without blowing his top, and he was a high-strung man to begin with. Short's character, Franck, is back with the same kooky qualities, and his driving to the hospital and all added much humor. I was happy to see some vulnerability in this movie, such as Keaton and Williams crying over the littlest thing-like all mothers do. The baby room, the deliveries, everything was so sweet. There isn't anything nasty or vengeful about it- it's just a soft, warm movie about a normal family with two babies on the way,with bright hopes for the future. Everything just seemed to pull together. The plot may be a bit predictable, but it's still great just to kick back and enjoy this two-hour movie accompanied with an emotional uplift.

In the first movie,  George Banks feels guilty when he sees his daughter trying to economize for  her wedding because he's stressed about money (and what's wrong with  economy, I'd like to know?). This time, he allows Martin Short's  too-weird-to-be-real wedding coordinator cater the baby shower. Do people  really get baby showers catered? And why does most of America seem to  relate to this family that does? And has anyone actually met a couple that  thought about making up their child's last name?
