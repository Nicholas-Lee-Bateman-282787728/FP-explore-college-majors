Yong Mun Chee has directed a terrific little film and made it BIG. 5 different people end up in a rooming house in L.A. in the early 2000's, the stories that unfold are touching and lovely. Eric Mabius, successful east coast philandering businessman, loses his wife and his life and heads west. Will Yun Lee has just awakened from a 4 year coma in Japan and goes to L.A., Fernando Noriega, married with a child in Mexico...illegal in the U.S. working hard to get his family here meets Luke Brandon Field (to me the stand out performance) the ladies man, poor, doesn't care and illegal from England. Friendships happen and stories happen and such a wonderful movie and wonderful characters and performances.",1400976000,,760,4.8538461538461535

8456262,4,B0054509J8,"This film is a character contrast of four individuals who stay at a Hollywood $40 a night hotel in 2004. This film has won 3 international awards. The hotel has a common living and kitchen area so the guests intermingle. They include:

Takashi (Will Yun Lee) is a Japanese mobster who got jilted by a woman. He crashed his car into a wall and was in a coma for 4 years. He is trying to forget his past.

Blake (Eric Mabius) is the hotel manager who was also unlucky at love.

Julio (Fernando Noriega) is an illegal who works in a restaurant. He sends all his money back home to his wife and child.

Guy (Luke Brandon Field) is British. Julio got him a job, which he messed up. Guy's dad sends him money from time to time to survive.

The characters are not particularly honest, but at the same time do not generate any evil persona.  The film contrasts characters such as Julio who needs a green card and Guy who buys one as a souvenir. It also contrast young and old. At what time do we stop living for today and dwell on the past...or is there magic air that reborns us? This is at times, a slow moving indie without much plot. Not for everyone. Good acting. Decent script.

Occasional f-bomb, sex, brief nudity",1335225600,3,1213,4.317180616740088
8456263,4,B0054509J8,"Singapore  writer-director Yong Mun Chee has created a film that wile it may take some mental adjustments in order to become involved n the strange story, the work is well worth the effort.  The cast is uniformly strong except for the fact that in three cases the accents are so thick that they approach not being understood.  This is a film that would benefit form subtitles throughout: the script is strong and deserves to be understood.

Very briefly the film's story  or series of connected vignettes about four immigrants to Los Angeles) can be summarized as follows: 'Takashi (sensitive Korean American actor Will Yun Lee), a Japanese hitman who wakes up from a four-year coma, moves to LA to escape mysterious traumatic memories. He strikes an unusual friendship with Blake (Eric Mabius, a strong young actor), the hotel manager of a cheap and sleazy Hollywood hotel, who still mourns the loss of his wife to an affair he ended up regretting.  Julio (Mexican actor Fernando Noriega), an illegal immigrant who works washing dishes in an Indian restaurant to provide for his wife and son still in Mexico, befriends Guy (Luke Brandon Field), a young British backpacker who lives off his estranged father's ATM card and sleeps with any girl who crosses his path. The story splices between the blossoming of these two friendships. Takashi attempts to help Blake break from his past, but in the process is forced to confront his own violent memories. Julio and Guy hustle for day to day survival and forge dreams of a better future, but after Julio steals Guy's passport and sells it for a thousand dollars, not only is their friendship at stake but also their lives. What follows are the at times wild and often gut-wrenching adventures of four men trying to survive both emotionally and physically.  It slowly becomes obvious that the relationship between Julio and Guy borders on the daring deeds that each is willing to make (with some very sad complications and results) while Blake and Takashi are bonded by past tragedies, yet both want to find something to believe in - a new start.  The wrong elements these four men carry end up in the wrong hands and that changes their lives inextricably.

Each of the quartet of men gives a completely credible performance (understanding Noriega's, Takashi's and Field's heavy accents is trying at times): we do identify with their plights and they keep us on their side.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially the work of Jesse Garcia, Eric Avari, Laura Ramsey, and Elsa Pataky.  WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE SUN is a bit unpolished - but that gritty feeling of the film adds tot he raw story Yong Mun Chee has created.  The title comes form the lyrics of the song by Matthew Perryman Jones and Katie Herzig: `Angels wings spread over water worn wishes Guarding the dreams and the things left unsaid And when it's done we will walk where the road meets the sun.'
