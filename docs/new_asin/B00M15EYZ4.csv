8669605,4,B00M15EYZ4,"Cult is an interesting film that's not your run of the mill J-Horror flick.

In fact, Cult is the third film in a project connected to the same Producer of The Grudge, Ring and Dark Water. The other two films from this series are Talk to the Dead and The Crone.

In Talk to the Dead, we had another J-Horror story of how  technology interconnects with the afterlife. While The Crone puts its characters at a haunted location, which in turn causes them havoc. But in Cult, we have something quite different. This film uses the idea of making an investigative documentary to pull its audience in. While that approach doesn't always work for me, Cult was the best story by far.

The film starts off when three pop idols Yu, Mari and Mayuko are hired to go along with a filmmaker and a priest to film an exorcism. They arrive at the home of the Kaneda's, where a single mother and her teen daughter, Miho, have been experiencing paranormal activity. By paranormal, I mean the Japanese style. The house has been overrun by demons that typically appear as long worm-like objects that float  through the air. They can also enter bodies as they see fit. There are also times where the image  of a person can be seen, but this film's not about a female ghost with long black hair. It's more of a Japanese spiritual film with exorcism components, similar to Mu Shi Shi.  Only Cult is done with a  modern flare.

Once in the house, Unsui, the priest, attempts to exorcise the demons. At first he seems to have some success. But eventually he's hospitalized. Miho and her mother have no choice but to turn to an unpredictable ghost hunter who claims no religion at all. In fact, he doesn't even give them his name. Eventually they settle on Neo, like Neo from The Matrix films, and that's how they address him for the rest of the movie.

 Neo has psychic powers, more powerful than the priest. But he's also rude and brash most of the time. It creates some interesting moments between Neo, the Kaneda's and the documentary team. The film takes us along some interesting twists and turns, until we reach the conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say this was a well done film. It's not like the J-Horror films that have been pumping out of Japan over the last decade or so. And I really liked how it had similarities to Mu Shi Shi. The film  gets your attention right away when the crew arrives at the Kaneda house with the priest, but it really grabs you once Neo comes on the scene. His rude behavior towards the otherwise skittish females really adds color to the film. It can be funny at times, or make you think he's just a big jerk. In any case, he has to act that way since he's the only one who knows what he's doing. Everyone else in the home is either a victim or a bystander.

The film offers the right amount of twists and turns, mystery  and paranormal strangeness to keep your attention. My only complaint is the style in which the film was shot. Like I said, this film was shot as if it was being created for a paranormal investigative show. That means the camera angles aren't always steady. And there are a few times where unnecessary edits occur to give the feel that it's a real documentary. I've never been a fan of that style of film making. But what saves Cult from the cutting room floor are it's creative ideas and characters. They help you disregard all the annoying filming effects.

Cult is presented in Japanese only with English subtitles. No other special features appear besides the trailer.

In the end I'm giving Cult a four. It was a nice change of pace from your run of the mill J-Horror flick. Neo pretty much steals the show and he does it all in an entertaining way. The loss of a star is due to the documentary filming style. That bugged me at first, but grew on me after awhile. Worth a watch if you like Mu Shi Shi or you just want to check out a different type of J-Horror flick.

And there is a reason why the film is called Cult, but telling you more than that would only spoil it for you. You'll just have to watch it for yourself.",1414281600,7,4079,4.373015873015873
