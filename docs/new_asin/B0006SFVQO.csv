8042586,3,B0006SFVQO,This features hot spots around the globe that attract confrontation due to dictators and/or political world leaders creating global trade agreements that the unwashed masses somehow feel are geared toward a One World Government which leads to unemployment. At times not easy to watch due to violence. At other times a bit of insight that the viewer may not be aware of due to the rigors of daily life and the events may not have been reported on the daily news because they are too difficult to clearly explain and/or too unpleasant to be broadcast.,1518912000,,549,4.7894736842105265

I was well written and is a story that needs to be told.",1364169600,,119,3.6153846153846154
8042588,5,B0006SFVQO,"One of the main complaints about the dvd is the lack of background information on struggles against globalization, neoliberalism, etc.  Because of this  I would not recommend this documentary to someone who does not already have some knowledge about these issues and the worldwide resistance.  I came upon this dvd looking for a documentary to teach students about third world resistance to globalization, having already shown them documentaries on the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle.  The imagery in this video is incredibly powerful, showing everything from the national strikes in Korea to Palestinian children throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.  The Fourth World War mainly focuses on images like these, showing average ""powerless"" people standing up against riot police and the state.  It gives minimal background information in the context of an unbiased look at the pros and cons of industrialization, globalization, wto, and what not.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to see 3rd world resistance and the devastating effects of capitalism that members of the first world rarely see.  I would not recommend it as an introduction to such issues, unless your view already gravitates towards a radical leftist perspective.  If anyones wants more background on such things I would check out the books Confronting Capitalism, and Globalize Liberation.  Naomi Klein's documentary The Take also provides an in depth analysis of the how the IMF destroyed Argentina's Economy.  Not Sure? Watch if for free before you buy it on Google movies.  But don't be fooled, Google is a big evil corporate power cataloging your searches and routinely turning in dissidents to the Chinese government (both of those points are true, look them up if you don't believe me).",1202688000,10,1762,5.2313167259786475
8042589,2,B0006SFVQO,"First, the technicalities. The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows.
Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.
I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie.",1188691200,,500,5.109756097560975
8042590,5,B0006SFVQO,"4th World War - taken from a speech by Marcos calling the war against globalization the 4th World War - is a brief, slightly glamourized, documentary of radical resistance to global capitalism.  While in retrospect its contridictory to buy it from amazon, the arguments stand alone.  Combining footage from various media outlets from across the globe, it is an inspirational film that brings about emotions ranging from anger to glee.  It works great as an educational tool when presenting what direct action is, explaining the the myriad problems stemming across the globe or just a good old fashion riotporn party (Korea knows how to take the streets!)4th World War is worth having in your collection.",1163462400,13,703,5.095652173913043
8042591,5,B0006SFVQO,"I think the goal of the movie is to share the experience of struggles to resist it around the world.  It does this wonderfully.  It also offers a great introduction to the problems of globalization by the elites to establish context.  It doesn't go way in depth into the dynamics of globalization, I don't think that was their goal.  That doesn't mean that if you already know about the issue that the movie loses its value.  It's a Great movie and it's perfect for sharing with other people to teach and inspire them.

It is somewhat glamorized by the music and poetry, but I don't think its overdone.  They combine different forms of media to create a powerful narrative.  For that I think it should be commended, not criticized. It has the side effect of communicating well to a culture mind f*cked by the action drama of hollywood and tv.

Criticizing it for being made in the US is also not really helpful.  Of course it can be difficult for people to relate to the experiences of people being crushed by globalization.  But again, that is why this movie is so good, it helps people relate.

If you think the criticisms made would ruin the movie for you then maybe you won't like it and they will have been helpful for you.  But I wanted to let you know that despite the criticisms, this movie is basically perfect for what it is meant to be and I would Highly recommend it.",1142208000,22,1379,4.446215139442231
8042592,3,B0006SFVQO,"I give this film a 3 based on my standard of progressive documentaries.  This documentary doesn't give an in depth analysis of the impacts of globalization.  Rather, it makes very generalizations and uses common liberal buzz phrases.  If you know very little about NAFTA, the WTO, FTAA, IMF, the military industrial complex, or the connections between the state and corporate interests, I would not watch this film first.  Because it doesn't give you that information.  Actually, if you do know a lot about those things, the film may annoy you.  It simplifes a lot of very complex issues.  On top of that this film attempts to make connections between struggles of peoples around the world - calling it the fourth world war-- Although global capitalism does create a lot of connections between struggles, conflicts in each nation- are complex and cannot just be seen as a part of the same battle-- What happened in Argentina in the 70s, what's happening in Chiapas, Palestine, Mexico, what's happening in South Africa- are totally different--- much of the problems in these nations are not just the result of neoliberalism-- but also the legacy of colonialism - and resulting internal conflicts....  The activists who made the film appropriated images of struggle around the globe and in some ways made them theirs--- a part of their critic of globalization.  Since many activists in the US have no idea about what it is like to struggle under militarized conflicts and because their privilege (ability to speak for others) comes from colonialism and neoliberalism--- I  find this to be problematic and offensive.

The film glamorizes struggles of peoples in the ""third world"".  One portion of the  U.S. political poet over images from palestine.  Rather than getting the opinions from people living in palestine, they resort to a poem talking about how horrible it is to live in an occupied land- which the poet probably knows little about.  But, this is how the film felt overall.  It seemed to be edited so voices from the ""third world"" fit into the mold of what US activists want to hear them say. Romanticizing the movements and struggles of communites of color!",1138320000,20,2167,4.961218836565097
8042593,4,B0006SFVQO,"Documentary - This documentary is great for educational purposes and individuals who like to see both sides of the coin, including news that are commonly hidden by our media.

The Fourth World War is ""a daring, courageous, heart-pounding intervention against empire"" and its destructions of societies.  It shows the blunt impacts conglomerates have on the global society, but also the power `small, powerless' individuals have once they get organized. It ""is the untold human story of men and women who resist being annihilated in the current global conflict.""

""While our airwaves are crowded with talk of a new world war, narrated by generals and filmed from the noses of bombs, the human face of war is rarely seen.  This documentary weaves together the images and voices of the war on the ground - from the front lines of struggle for economic survival in Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Palestine, Korea, `the North' from Seattle to Genova, and the `War on Terror' in New York and Iraq.  The product of over two years of filming, The Fourth World War is a new kind of film for a new world. The intensity and immediacy of its images are beyond anything the mainstream media can shoot; the intimacy and passion of its stories are beyond anything it can feel. Narrated by Tony Award winner Suheir Hammad and Singer Michael Franti of Spearhead, it is a radical story of hope and human connection in the face of a war that shatters and divides.""
