8750678,5,B01BMH1PGC,Wow!  Did we ever enjoy this movie!  This gorgeous print looks like it was filmed the day before yesterday.  The organ soundtrack is perfect;  the sequence featuring a three part stage show is a visual delight:  what crazy deco. costumes!  This movie will be enjoyed time and time again.,1501372800,5,287,4.755102040816326

8750680,4,B01BMH1PGC,"Marion Davies has oft been maligned over the years despite her strengths in comedies.  This film is great fun, and while not on par with her best work is certainly enjoyable.  My only complaint is the musical soundtrack which has been affixed to it.  In this particular case turning off the sound is probably a better option when viewing this picture.",1496880000,,351,4.721311475409836
