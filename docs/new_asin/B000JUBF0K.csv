8157149,4,B000JUBF0K,"Using Curtis's photos and what survives of his original narration, modern animators have produced the kind of dramatic presentation Curtis might have created if he had not been limited by the technology of his time (1911). Some additional footage has been added.",1433721600,,262,5.261904761904762
8157150,5,B000JUBF0K,This is an interesting presentation that reflects on a dark part of American history. The assault on Native Americans will never be forgotten. These images of Indian portraits bring a very human dimension. The works of Edward Curtis are a resource that should be commended.,1193529600,,273,5.088888888888889
8157151,5,B000JUBF0K,"I enjoyed hearing the words of Curtis, as he was a much misunderstood man. It  showed an empathy that history has ignored about the man. His empathy toward the Indian, that is.

It was pleasing to watch something that wasn't strictly a documentary, but a piece of time, unearthed.

It looked and sounded great on my HD set with surround-sound.

To offer a suggestion, more music would make it ever better.",1188345600,2,405,4.661971830985915
8157152,1,B000JUBF0K,"This is a very poor indication of Curtis's photography. The amateurish production is wrought with lame special effects that get in the way of viewing the actual works. The narration is informative at times, but redundant and often needless. I was hoping just to see his remarkable photographs with accompany score as it was originally intended.  This is not the original slide show that stunned and amazed audiences in 1911. Save your money. A much better documentary on the life and monumental works of Edward Curtis is ""Coming to Light.""",1187827200,6,539,4.988888888888889
