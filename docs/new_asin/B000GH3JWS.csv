8132166,3,B000GH3JWS,"So do you think this is going to teach you how to play, lets say, a buzz roll, or perhaps even a closed-sounding single stroke roll, with one hand?  I did.  Basically, here's what it trains you to do: place the tip of your stick on the head, then bring the rest of the stick down on the rim, then rock the tip back down on the head. Repeat, building up speed.  The author has perfected this technique to good effect, but  I find the marketing and advertising of this product a little slick and misleading, as there is no clue that the technique being taught is something different from what any drummer with a knowledge of the rudiments would consider a standard roll. (I wondered why, on his promotional online video, you never see his hands once he goes into the ""roll."") On the other hand, this did expand my horizon by introducing an idea to my drumming that I simply had never considered before.",1204675200,4,900,4.403614457831325
