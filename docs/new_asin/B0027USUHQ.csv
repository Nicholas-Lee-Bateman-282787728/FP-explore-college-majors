3868586,4,B0027USUHQ,"I love this core yoga dvd. I usually go to a power vinyasa flow yoga class, and this dvd is very similar to the class. An excellent workout!! There are times when Nardini is not fast enough with the cues, but it is still possible to keep up. VERY challenging!",1248912000,5,259,4.2
3868587,5,B0027USUHQ,"I like this DVD a lot. It has 5 different preset practices to choose from:

(another reviewer posted these, but the times were slightly off. This is taken directly from the DVD menu)

Core Transformer 1 hr
Learning to Fly 1 hr 15 min
Whole Body Sculpt 1 hr 30 min
Hip & Shoulder Opener 1 hr 30 min
Inversion & Detox 1 hr 20 min
Relax & Restore 1 hr

I find these options to be perfect. Rarely do I want to do less than an hour, and if I did, this DVD gives the option of choosing from about 12 smaller segments that make up the longer practice individually. For instance, I could choose ""Core warmup and dedication"" ""Core Salutations"" ""Core and Power"" and ""Floor poses and restore"" for about a 30 minute core intensive workout. It's not like a ""matrix"" however, you would have to go back to the menu between each section.

What I love most about this DVD is that is has options for intermediate practitioners, yet also gives modifications for beginners to begin to attempt the poses. The fact that she teaches handstand is awesome! And for people not ready to go up into handstand, there is a very doable preparatory pose she calls ""Shakti kicks."" I get sweaty and wrung out, even if I choose the 1 hr practice. I do wish there was an option for a longer Savasana. (EDITED TO ADD: While looking over the DVD I noticed that during Savasana it says ""Press Pause here for a longer resting time."" I had never noticed this because I was laying down with my eyes closed. I still wish there was another Savasana, longer, with music, but I wanted to point out that she does make room for a longer Savasana. Her Savasana is about 5 minutes, which is good for days when I'm short on time.)

Also, if you haven't checked out Sadie on YouTube, make sure you do! She has lots of little tutorials about how to do the poses better and more effectively. Having trouble with crow in the video? Go to her YouTube channel and search for crow. She has several videos giving tips on how to work on it.

Sadie's personality and voice are great. She's encouraging and positive, yet minimal in her comments, so I don't find myself getting tired of her. The set is simple, in a studio, yet beautiful. It's a good production.",1247443200,13,2199,4.364303178484108
3868588,5,B0027USUHQ,"They say that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear and this was true for me and coming across Sadie and her empowering style of yoga known as Core Strength Vinyasa (CSV).

Last November (2008) a friend emailed me a link to a company that makes custom yoga mats. On the front page of this company's website was a box promoting Sadie Nardini and CSV. Clicking box this led to Sadie's website and from that starting point I explored her numerous YouTube videos and various podcasts.

I was genuinely amazed ... as a relatively new yoga teacher (2.5 years at that point) I am always looking for ways to inspire my students, offering them yoga that is fun, safe yet challenging, and most of all therapeutic and transformative. And that is what Sadie teaches! The clarity of her presentation is excellent.

I have spent literally thousands of dollars on live yoga workshops and programs during my ""yoga career"". Some were good, some so-so, and some a waste of money. What Sadie offers is among the highest quality instruction you will find anywhere.

Even more amazing is that she takes the time to read and respond to emails she receives. If you have a question about CSV you can email her and she will reply! Wow! Even though I have never met her in person I can tell that she really cares.

This new DVD from Sadie is simply one of the very best yoga DVDs I have seen. I have looked at numerous yoga DVDs and truly the world of yoga is been blessed with some wonderful, dedicated teachers.

However, relatively few DVDs are sensitive to the journey of an evolving personal yoga practice explaining the ""seed"" of a pose and the steps necessary to grow into the full expression of the pose.

When I started practicing yoga it took me two years to master Crow Pose and that was because none of the teachers with whom I was taking classes explained the steps involved. Finally one teacher was kind enough to take time with me and take me through it step-by-step until I mastered it.

Sadie is that kind of teacher. On this DVD she explains the steps necessary to rock a Crow, to jump into Crow, to master Handstand, and more. All within the context of a strong core-centered vinyasa flow that will strengthen and tone you from inside out.

This is one important aspect of Core Strength Vinyasa. We tend to be strong in our major outer muscles like quadriceps and hamstrings, gluteals, back muscles, etc, but weaker and less aware or connected to our deep core muscles.

CSV is about contacting and really ""making friends"" with your deep core muscles so you can be strong and stable in every pose. Every pose is generated from the core whether it is Mountain, Chair, Triangle, Warrior I/II/III, Half Moon, Eagle, or something else.

As you work with this DVD you will become very strong in your core muscles and this will make every pose much easier and more refined. It will also have the added benefit of improving your posture.

However, CSV also has a ""mental side"" to it. All of us tend to ""put out"" a lot of energy in our daily activities. This is especially true if you are in a health care type profession such as me (I am a Licensed Bodyworker in addition to being a Yoga Instructor). Finding our personal boundaries and staying grounded and centered can be very challenging when people need your help.

Core Strength Vinyasa teaches you how to be core-centered in your daily life away from the mat. Through Sadie's cueing, what you experience in your body will flow on into your psyche leaving you feeling empowered and better able to remain authentic throughout the rest of your day.

I highly recommend this DVD ... it really is completely worth the money and will give you a lot of insight and personal enjoyment. I have been practicing with it daily since I received it several weeks ago, and it has helped me tremendously already.

It contains the best of Sadie's teaching which has been transformative in both my own life, and the lives of my students (as I share what I am learning with them) during the past 8 months. Thank you so much Sadie!",1245542400,36,4066,4.565934065934066
3868589,5,B0027USUHQ,"If you only have funds for one vinyasa yoga dvd this year, then get this one.  You will not be sorry.  This intense, sweaty, fun and creative yoga practice covers everything. I don't remember all of the poses, but I can tell you that they're all here; from down dog to up dog to warriors 1, 2 and 3; crescent lunge and twist; moving half moon; moving triangle; pigeon variation; crow pose and variation; firefly; forward bend and variations; lots of hip openers; handstand prep jumps and handstand; floor stretches. Here is what you get:

Workout segments that you can mix and match to create your own class
Core Warm-up and dedication
Core Salutations
Opening and toning
stamina and balance
twist and energize
hip opening & release
Upper and lower body sculpt
core inversions and detox _- this section includes Sadie's 30 jumps where you come into down dog with hands over shoulders and jump you are jumping into hand stand.  Next you lift one leg up and jump on one leg like you were jumping into handstand.  Next is handstand at the wall.  All of the jumps are at the wall also.  It will take me a while to do this section, but I'm game!

Preset classes
core transformation 1 hr
learning to fly 1.5hr
whole body sculpt 1 .5hr

inversions & detox 1.15hr
relax and restore 1 hr

I've done 3 of the above preset classes and I enjoyed each of them.  Sadie's yoga is dynamic.  She flows in and out of poses as opposed to static poses where you have long holds.  You are always moving in her vinyasa yoga and that is what makes you sweat up a storm.  My favorite pose is moving half-moon where you do half moon on each side and then curl down to bent knee forward bend and then stretch open to half moon on the opposite side.  Sweet!

I'm 50 years old so I had to rest a lot but I felt great after each class and was not wiped out.  Get this dvd, you won't regret it.  I plan on doing the classes 3 times a week as I am trying to lose weight and this dvd beats going to the gym and lifting weights any day of the week.

Great job Sadie.  I look forward to next dvd!",1244851200,24,2166,4.277641277641278
3868590,5,B0027USUHQ,"I agree with the first 2 reviews on this DVD so I won't bother repeating what has already been written.

I've practiced yoga at home for about 10 years without benefit of personal instruction.  I own over 20 DVD's on yoga and at least a dozen books on the subject because although my life does not allow me to get out and go to classes, I am a very serious student.  I'm 50 years old and I need to stay fit and balanced to take care of my aging body as well as a severely disabled loved one.  That said, I count on instructors who can reach out to people they've never met and try to anticipate all the questions and various levels of ability of these many students.

I first encountered Sadie Nardini through her wonderful YouTube videos.  If you are sitting on the fence and want to see for yourself how this woman instructs I suggest you go to her YouTube channel [...] and watch some of her many offerings.  After watching her videos I longed for a DVD with Sadie talking me through a good routine.  Sadie really delivers with this DVD.  You get the benefit of her explanations and unique approach to yoga with a routine that is beautifully designed.  Sadie also has a preview of this DVD on her website:[...] She needs to link it here as well, hopefully she'll do that.

Sadie moves through everything slowly and carefully.  If you are a beginner or restarting after taking too much time off (raising my hand) this gives you plenty of time to adjust to getting into the various poses.  If you've built up some stamina and you know the routine well, this slowness really forces you to develop grace, strength and really challenges your stamina.

The routines she has outlined is quite a bit like buying several DVDs in a set.  Sadie could easily have made about 4-6 separate DVD's with the material she offers but she found a way to give it to you all in one DVD.  Sadie doesn't cheat you anywhere during the workout.  If you can't last through the whole thing - I was struggling toward the end.  I just backed off and trusted that with time I would rebuild my endurance.  The restorative phase is often rushed through in some DVD's in order to squeeze in a lot of poses but Sadie is very conscientious in this area as well.  I love the way she takes you through the restorative phase and oh dear, it was really necessary by the time she got done with me.

If you don't have time to do any of her full length workouts you can select small sections to work on.  This is useful also if there is something that really challenges you and you wish to study and practice it more.  As one reviewer already stated, a matrix option would have been nice here but it really isn't that much of an effort to select a section, then select another and sometimes those matrix menus can be a pain in the rear to navigate anyway.  So I can't really complain about this small thing when everything else is so outstanding.

Although I order a lot of material from Amazon I don't bother to write reviews very often so this lets you know how strongly I feel about this particular DVD.  If you like Shiva Rhea but find her a bit hard to keep up with, try out Sadie.  You won't find her easy but what you will find is some really good explanations and ways to build into some of the more difficult things you might find in other DVD's.  This one DVD by itself has all you need to use yoga to build a fierce body but if you like to switch to other instructors and workouts to keep from being bored, then Sadie will help you to be better at all those other workouts as well.  It's one of the best resource materials I now own on yoga.  Thank-you Ms. Nardini for making this DVD.",1244160000,226,3656,4.302631578947368
3868591,5,B0027USUHQ,"I discovered Sadie through her YouTube videos, which are excellent, and a great preview for this DVD practice. Her sequences are so much fun--they always contain an unexpected element, and you'll get a sweaty and invigorating workout. The pace is brisk but not frantic. I was able to extend fully into poses before she moved on. The core focus is worked in smoothly and consistently. This is NOT Pilates with a few yoga poses in between.

The DVD is broken into mini flows, including her unique Sun Salutations, a twisting flow, a balance flow, inversions, hip openers, arm balances, an ab flow, and a few others. Some of the sections are relatively brief (7-9 minutes-ish), while others are over 15 minutes.  She also includes several preset sequences, which, as the previous reviewer mentioned, are lengthy but so very worth it.

Lastly, Sadie has a great narration voice, and bless her, she avoids the goofy yoga metaphors and descriptors when she's detailing the poses. Awesome!!",1243900800,60,983,4.9817073170731705
3868592,5,B0027USUHQ,"Sadie's new DVD lives up to the expectations from her first one. It has 5 sequences all guaranteed to make you sweat and feel the burn :-) Most of the poses and sequences are a build up from the first DVD and are definitely more challenging with variations in flow and length of poses. The practice is set against a nice warm backdrop and is visually more appealing than DVD 1. The only drawback is that the 5 sequences are at least an hour long each (1 hr min and 1.5 hr max) so if you are short on time you will have to manually choose from the 12 mini-workouts, which would have made it easier to customize had it come with a matrix menu. Other than that this one rocks !!",1243641600,4,675,4.121212121212121
3868593,3,B0027USUHQ,"It was okay, didn't think it was that challenging and I ended up getting bored 3/4 into it and just couldn't continue. It's not the length of the video, I'm used to practicing for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, but possibly the way it is sequenced. I think I'll give it a second chance, using the matrix system to better set up the different sections. FYI, I used Play All originally and the stretchy, calming poses were right at the 3/4 mark and then transitioned into inversions and so on.",1315958400,,478,4.322222222222222
3868594,5,B0027USUHQ,"I hate aerobic exercise so wanted something that would do the same but with less bouncing and jumping around. This Vinyasa flow yoga DVD by Sadie Nardini brings my heart rate and breathing up about 20 minutes into whatever session I choose. It challenges my muscles as well. Even though it is a very intense ""workout"", it brings me peace while I practice. Sadie's instruction is very calming and encouraging and the music gives added relaxation. I can choose from six 1-1 and a half hour sessions or I can choose separate sequences for times when I am short on time. These sequences are broken up into 5 - 10 min blocks that are specific to an area of body or theme.  I love this DVD.",1312848000,2,684,4.428571428571429
3868595,5,B0027USUHQ,"I first found her on Youtube, after doing some of her free excersises, I wanted a dvd that I didn't have to watch on my computer and I found this. I was doing total body workout with Rodney by Giam, and it got to easy, and this was the hardest yoga dvd I could find, and then, I found Sadie. Wow, I have to stop the dvd and catch my breath, it is a serious workout! For those of you who are advanced in Yoga, and are looking for a challange, this is it!!",1308614400,,454,3.8404255319148937
3868596,5,B0027USUHQ,"This is a fun, versatile yoga practice.  Already noticing a difference.  Sardi made it possible to practice at home for me without getting distracted.  I used to think i had to go to a studio to work hard and stay focused.  I am cancelling the gym membership to save money thanks to her.
Only thing I don't like as much is that its her doing voice over herself.  I still love the workout but prefer when the instructor is talking in real time.",1302480000,,443,4.289156626506024
3868597,5,B0027USUHQ,"After injuring my knees from running I started doing yoga as a way to still get some sort of low-impact exercise and give me a break from just doing weights and the elliptical. Right now the only other home yoga video I have is Rodney Yee's Ultimate Power Yoga, which is great but having only 1 video to do on days when I cannot make it to the gym gets boring, so I bought this one to add to my collection for more variety. I wanted a yoga video that was challenging and could still be considered a workout (even if I'm not sweating like I would doing cardio), to ""make up"" for not going to the gym.

So far I have only done the video twice, the first 2 preset sequences, and I really like them a lot. They're challenging and I often have to rewind or pause to catch up with her, but I like that I have something to build up to; I know I will have to do the video often in order to build up to the level that she is at eventually, which is great! If it was easy and I could get it right away, I feel like I would get bored with it really fast and have to search for another video. I also like that there is a section where she explain modifications and offers up a type of breathing I had never done before, which I feel helps me engage my muscles just a tiny bit more than normally, which again, is great.

I also like that there is over 2 hours of material. Most videos are an hour, which once again, can get boring really fast and makes you have to search for more videos (marketing strategy perhaps?). Having twists, balance poses, and even offering inversions is great and thus far seem rather rare to have in a home video. Even though I'm not advanced enough to do many of these poses yet, like I said above, I am pleased that I have something to build up to. There are complaints that it's too challenging, but I don't see that as bad. There are poses that you can do and it's beneficial to have levels beyond your reach that are possible but require more patience and more practice - just like in a class. I honestly wouldn't like this video much at all if I could do the final execution of every pose on the first try. I've only done yoga for less than a year so if I can already do it, it probably isn't that difficult. I like a (reasonable) challenge! Of course, if the whole video was impossibly difficult, then that would also be a total waste as well.

Of course, I feel like yoga still cannot replace cardio, so I'll be glad when my latest injury (my ankle this time) is healed. However, all in all I'm very happy with this purchase!",1297123200,,2548,4.122736418511066
3868598,4,B0027USUHQ,"One of the best features of this DVD is the modularity. It offers around 10 modules from which you can configure your own workout, according to your own personal preferences and time availability. The feature allows you to get a very calm, no heart-pumping yoga session and heart racing, vigorous workout from the same DVD, depending on which modules you choose to combine.

I tried Sadie's Youtube videos, yoga sequences for weight loss many time, before purchasing this DVD. Sadie uses many of her 'signature' moves she uses in the Youtube videos such as the ""Shakti kicks"", extending of a leg in downface dog etc. in this DVD. I was impressed by the vigorousness of these Youtube workouts and proceeded to buy this DVD.

It may be my body that has adjusted to the level of these workouts, but I don't seem to get the same heart pumping workout experiences from doing the workouts in the DVD as I used to from Sadie's Youtube videos. I was interested in yoga to tone my body rather than calm my mind down or heighten spirituality. So now I have moved on from this yoga video to another one, ballet conditioning.

Though I don't expect to use the DVD very often in the future, while it lasted (2 months), this DVD helped me to strengthen physiques and add more flexibility.",1292976000,3,1274,4.60352422907489
3868599,4,B0027USUHQ,"I like this video.  The selections allow you to pick a preset program or pick and choose the routines you want.  The longer programs are challenging and effective.  I have improved my strength, flexibility and form as a result of practicing with Sadie.",1291680000,,252,4.813953488372093
3868600,2,B0027USUHQ,"I have been practicing yoga for about a year now. I'm not the most flexible individual. I would consider myself a moderate to intermediate practitioner.
PROS: She is not cheesy. Nice to listen to. And she is super flexible
CONS:
There are no modifications offered for poses. You have to know most of them by heart.
There are no pose ""reminders."" Meaning she doesn't remind you of the position your body should be in during a pose, like in a right leg lunge your right hip should move back, your left hip forward, your back leg bent if your lower back feels any tension, and your pelvis tilted forward--she takes for granted that you know all the positions.
She moves pretty quickly which can be good, but is hard to follow.

I think this will go on the shelf until I'm advanced or I'll be selling it here on Amazon. Not the best purchase. I enjoy Shiva Rea's DVDs much more. Shiva is super flexible but she offers what Sadie does not in instruction and coaching.

Don't buy unless you live in a yoga studio and are super flexible.",1290643200,9,1030,4.444444444444445
3868601,5,B0027USUHQ,"I bought this dvd based off of the great reviews it has, so I wanted to add another to maybe encourage someone else to pick up a great video.

I have had this dvd for awhile now and it still has not gotten boring.",1289606400,,401,4.0886075949367084
3868602,4,B0027USUHQ,"I already have this DVD for over a year and use it from time to time to get a kick ass creative yoga workout. Much better than her first DVD, this one offers 2 hours of material, preset practices and individual segments you can choose (too bad there's no matrix). The DVD has these segments as far as I remember (not the accurate names probably): core warm up, core salutations, twisting poses, standing balances, arm balances, a tough hanstand with shakti kicks segment, forward bends, backbends, core, and supine poses + shavasana. Sadie has some nice sequencing and her own take on vinyasa yoga (like moving to half moon from side to side rapidly). The set is nice and better than the previous DVD but still a little boring as well as the music. I wish the DVD would have better music and maybe a great outdoors set but those are just minor complaints. Overall a nice DVD for a creative yoga workout but don't expect holding a pose for more than a few seconds.",1286928000,3,963,4.508571428571429
3868603,4,B0027USUHQ,"I really like this DVD.  There is about 2 and a half hours of material and it's challenging.  I love that you can choose a sequence or a specific section.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is that the various sequences are not very different.  If I'm choosing from a variety of sequences I don't want to feel like I'm doing the same sequence over and over.  But otherwise, it's a great DVD.",1285718400,,392,4.243243243243243

Since I choose my segments, I guess I don't choose the right combination because I don't feel as if I worked out as the title claims. I don't feel as if my body is transforming or losing weight result of this dvd. I thought the moves would be faster. Anyways, I tried and I hated it so I traded it in. I think it's over priced as well. I guess this is not my type of yoga or instructor.",1278979200,2,531,3.925925925925926

UPDATE after doing Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, which is also great.  I think this DVD from Sadie may be a better fit than Rodney's for those of us who want to specifically tone our mid-sections...I notice that Sadie adds specific abdominal work (ex: plank pose but adding the extended leg coming up to the chest, etc.) into the Vinyasa flow, throughout the DVD.",1277683200,4,577,5.031578947368421

I can do more challenging sections when I feel up to it and also some more low key ones - whatever I'm in the mood for, she has. I feel great after doing her yoga workouts!
I highly recommend this dvd!

Sadie is an enthusiastic,fun,responsible, and confident teacher. She takes you through each asana while instructing how to get into and out of the poses safely. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for brand new beginners as the sequences do move rapidly.
My only criticism is that there isn't any chanting and meditation. They're the foundation for any yoga practice. Without this the practice feels incomplete. Hopefully we'll see this in Sadie's future DVD's.",1276041600,,596,4.852941176470588
3868610,3,B0027USUHQ,"Let me start by saying that I love Sadie. I love her personality, her philosophy, her writing. I bought this DVD with much anticipation. I have been seriously practicing ashtanga yoga for a couple of years now, and thought this would be a good variation to my practice Well it is and it isnt. It is a good workout, but not a good ""yoga"" workout. The moves involve multiple repetitions of challenging (in terms of strength) positions and really does get you sweating, yet it feels very little like yoga the way I know it. The positions are challenging in the sense of requiring a lot of strength and stamina but I never get the feeling it is doing anything for me at a deeper level. And I don't mean just spiritual but even say the joints or the endocrinal glands or other internal systems. Really wanted to love this one, but just cant.",1274140800,10,836,4.435064935064935

This video is a well done piece that will work you head to toe.  Thank you Sadie for your contribution to all of us!,1268352000,2,422,4.4868421052631575
3868613,5,B0027USUHQ,"I love Sadie!  I wake up each morning to her calm but energetic voice leading me through my morning ""getting in touch with my day"" ritual.  At first I could barely make it through each section.  I couldn't believe how challenged I was! Now I, as I can see and feel my progress, I actually experience euphoria in my practice.  I'm still challenged - I haven't reached the full expressions of every pose.  But that is terrific because it means that I have all that room to grow and improve as a yogi.

The fat is melting off my body (this is aided by the fact that I have also adopted a plant-based dietary life-style with a B-12 supplement and Flax seed for Omega 3).  I can see the definition coming to my body and I no longer feel the horrible pain in my shoulders that used to plague me.  I am amazed by how fast the weight is coming off and how fast the definition is setting in without doing crazy cardio work.  These workouts combine a cardio challenge with strength training in a way that is deceptively slow and low-impact yet as delightfully effective as any high-impact program I have ever experienced.

Sadie's DVD is well worth the money. I can hardly wait for the next one :).",1268006400,8,1188,4.359090909090909
3868614,5,B0027USUHQ,"I have been practicing yoga since November 2009 and am by no means an advanced student.  This video is PERFECT for me!  It's very challenging, but I know enough of the basic moves that I can do them and not feel left behind.  I know over time I'll be able to do the more advanced poses and I love having a DVD that lets me grow.  This is such a bargain-you get 5 different workouts in one video.  I recommend this to every yoga student I know!",1268006400,3,443,4.045977011494253
3868615,3,B0027USUHQ,"I had been using Rodney Yee's videos Yoga Burn and Power Yoga: Total Body workout before purchasing this. This is very different. Although as challenging as Power Yoga: Total Body, the style just did not suit me as much. Rodney's cues are concise and to the point... Sadie adds some ""motivation"" with hers. Some of the poses feel awkward to me, and not in a good, ""this is working my muscles out"" kind of way. For instance the high lunge where the back foot is kept arched for an eternity rather than being grounded as is more common in yoga; that one gave me an awful foot cramp. The chair pose hugging in and out gave me a back cramp. There are a lot of crunches. I think having done more traditional yoga, I just did not get into this one. I still use the video once in a while, with lukewarm enthusiasm. All that being said, this video might suit someone else's exercise personality perfectly.",1267920000,12,897,4.409638554216867
3868616,5,B0027USUHQ,"Watching Sadie flow through this video is art work at it's finest.  I have learned how to do several different poses differently, and with greater ease.  I only wish I'd found her sooner.  She is a yoga artist!",1266969600,,210,4.473684210526316
3868617,5,B0027USUHQ,"Being fairly new to yoga, but not to exercise, I find this workout with Sadie easy to follow and challenging. Out of all my yoga Cd's, this is by far my favorite. I really feel like i have had a workout. The way she flows trough the poses is very strengthening for the whole body. it is helpful to me as a massage student with building my core strength and posture....thanks Sadie",1266883200,2,380,4.291666666666667
3868618,3,B0027USUHQ,"While this DVD is a good one, I only gave it three stars because it is definately for the more advanced yoga practioner.  She does not show ways to modify the poses and it's nearly impossible to get into most of the poses if you are not already strong and flexible.  I've been doing yoga, though not daily, for several years but there were several poses I couldn't even begin to do.  I would only recommend this video if you want to take your yoga to a higher, more challenging level.",1264982400,15,484,4.2967032967032965
3868619,5,B0027USUHQ,Sort of a harmonious fusion between kundalini and vinyasa yoga. I can't bear to do any of my other yoga workouts - I feel like this was made for me! I even look forward to attempting the more difficult poses. You can mix and match the different routines to suit your timeframe/state of mind/physical needs. Definitely recommended for the intermediate yoga practitioner.,1263513600,2,369,4.967741935483871
3868620,5,B0027USUHQ,"I got this DVD to get back into yoga after a year off (and after too much holiday food). I'd never exercised with a DVD before and was skeptical, but Sadie is amazing. Some of her sequences are more advanced than I am (I can't do inversions of any sort) but you can pick and choose from different shorter sections that allow for a gentler learning experience. I think another reviewer listed the available DVD selections.

Sadie has developed a challenging routine that kicks your butt but stays true to yoga (albeit rigorous yoga). No karate kicks or dancing here. One amazing thing is how Sadie shows you new ways to move into poses. I've always had trouble with standing poses (warrior I & II, e.g.) and my previous instructors used a sequence of movements leading to standing poses that I always found difficult. With Sadie, I realized that I don't need a block to do Utthita Trikonasana, and I've only had the DVD for 4 days. I would never have even considered trying this before. She offers advice on modifying positions if you're 'building strength' (a nice way of saying you're sort of out of shape/inflexible, like me). If you need a ton of guidance for modifying positions, this may not be the best DVD for you. I'm an advanced beginner and have some knowledge of how to go easy and not overextend myself, but some of her poses are quite advanced and injury would be possible without proper caution. That said, her sequences are really transformative and body-changing. You do burn fat/calories - this is an aerobic workout. I can't recommend this DVD enough.",1262476800,10,1569,4.684782608695652
3868621,5,B0027USUHQ,"I purchased this DVD based on the strong reviews and watching some of Sadie's youtube videos. This DVD has been simply amazing for me and my practice. I was looking for a yoga DVD that provided a workout for my body physically and mentally as well. This DVD provided both of those things for me and is well worth buying. Sadie is a great instructor that puts time and effort into her practice. While performing the flows in this DVD, I was always able to either check out her website or a website video for more information if I needed to. How many other DVD yoga instructors provide that type of service for no cost? That is what makes her amazing.

So far, I have done two of the workout sequences that she has provided on the video. The Core Transformer is a shorter sequence at about an hour, but feels to be about 30 to 45 minutes. The reminder is mostly a rest at the end so it does feel short. Still very effective. I usually do this sequence when I am short on time. The next one I have used is the Whole Body Sculpt sequence about 1 1/2 hours. Totally love this workout and it really gets the heart pounding and I am left feeling amazing afterward. Her technique is unique and I love the ""Fists of Fire"" that she uses to get the heart rate up. She also has a set of alternating Half Moon poses that I have never done before that I thoroughly enjoyed. This instruction will build your core muscles which can reflect on other aspects of a yoga practice.

Her kind words and personality add to the feel of this DVD and keeps me coming back for more day after day. I usually alternate with another DVD as to not overdue my love for this DVD and burn myself out. :o) My level is about advanced beginner so there is some things on this DVD I have shied away from. I accidentally chose the Learning to Fly sequence on day and it was a little out of my league at my skill level. It has some interesting Crow poses that I just can't do yet. Will have to work up to that one so there is some intermediate to advanced skill level contained.

Thank you for your DVD Sadie and your devotion to the practice. If you do get a chance, don't hesitate to pick this one up. It doesn't disappoint and it will leave you sweaty and hungry for more.",1261180800,3,2235,4.205128205128205
3868622,5,B0027USUHQ,"Let me first start this out by saying that I have only been doing yoga for about 6 months.  I was introduced to it in P90X, and afterward, I decided I wanted more so I began to explore other yoga DVD options (Yee, Kest, Baptiste, Corne, Shiva Rea), since it is very hard for me to get to a class.  In the process of searching, I came across this DVD in Amazon.  I explored Sadie's website and youtube page.  As I began to make some headway with my own yoga practice, I decided to order it.  And wow!  It is fantastic.

Sadie is a great teacher and she really gives beginners good instruction and hope that they can progress.  This is not just a workout that I do, it's a workout that I grow with.  I love the ""seeds"" of yoga that I am sewing here and how I am growing.

Other things I like:
-There are 12 different yoga segments and 5 premixed practises - something, no matter how much time you have.
-As mentioned, the teaching is awesome and there are lots of modifications to help beginners reach their potential
-Sadie's voice is very soothing, and relaxing.  Even though she talks a lot, it is more assuring that bothersome like some other DVDs I have watched
-I love her own take on ""flow"" yoga - fists of fire, especially. And I love the Shatki kicks

A wonderful, challenging workout!",1259193600,5,1292,4.3153526970954355
3868623,3,B0027USUHQ,"If you're looking for ""power yoga,"" you'll probably love this workout. It *is* incredibly challenging, creative and varied, but despite the fact that there are yoga postures here, it doesn't feel like yoga to me. I don't mean to disparage Sadie or the practice. If a power workout is what you want, that's great and this may be it. I prefer more of a mind-body-spirit practice, so this just isn't for me. To each his or her own!

I had trouble keeping up with some of the cues. I was also a little worried about some of the moves - for example, ""Shakti kicks."" If you're not able to do these with complete control, it seems like you could really hurt yourself. Sadie is in fantastic condition, so even though I'm in ok shape, older (lol) me could in no way keep up with her! Again, it's up to the practitioner to be aware of limitations and adjust accordingly, but Sadie is so enthusiastic it's hard not to want to try to stick with it.

If you want a challenging workout, you might want to give this DVD a try. If you're looking for a more balanced, more than physical practice, you may want to consider looking elsewhere.",1259107200,99,1123,4.394230769230769

If you aren't sweating you aren't doing it! I love the intensity and use of breath work. She really did well with this video.

But THIS one I will use again and again.  The poses are challenging enough for a non-beginner and Sadie's instructions are well done so even if you are trying something for the first time, you won't injure yourself getting there.  The pace is excellent, not too slow to be boring but not too fast to be injurious or confusing.  Her words are clear and concise and encouraging without being preachy.  I highly recommend this DVD to intermediate practitioners that want a challenge and wish to deepen their practice.",1257465600,3,654,4.547008547008547
3868628,5,B0027USUHQ,"I think this is a great yoga DVD.  Works your whole body.  Easy to follow as long as you are familiar with the poses.
You can work the parts of the body you want.  You can get restore and detox sections.  It is a rewarding practice.
There is a lot of balance work.  Balancing is not my strong suit but I have noticed significant improvement since I have started using this DVD.  You can work up to two hours which helps build stamina and endurance.  This will give you more than an hour class will.
My yoga instructor makes us hold the poses for quite some time.  And, that has made a difference in the physical makeup of my body.  But, using this DVD helps you build up power also.  It is a great substitute for class if you need one.",1257120000,,735,4.148936170212766
3868629,5,B0027USUHQ,"I own many yoga and pilates DVDS and this is the first one that comes close to taking an actual in-person class.  There are great explanations that help you self-correct your posture and it actually challenges you.  Even the relaxation series is challenging.  Its great because you can select different workout series to suit your goals- relax, hip openers, etc.  This makes me wish I could take classes with her!  This is definitely not for beginners which thrills me since most DVDs seem to be too simple for someone who has been practicing for awhile.",1255824000,,554,4.7894736842105265
3868630,5,B0027USUHQ,"Sadie has developed her yoga practice into a unique vigorous style that flows continuously from one asana to the next, always moving, always changing. This DVD offers a sweat-inducing workout of a yoga practice that WILL help you lose weight. If you can stay focused throughout, it is also a great yoga practice, but the pace is a challenge, at least for me. She also offers an interesting set of wall exercises towards the end. The production quality of this DVD is better than most yoga video material. I reach for this one on the days when I feel like I've got energy to burn and want to feel completely wrung out by the end of my practice. I would NOT reach for this DVD on a day when I need a contemplative, meditative practice, or a soothing, restorative practice.",1254096000,5,770,4.507142857142857

3868632,5,B0027USUHQ,"Whew! What a workout. I ordered this video last week and got it Monday. I've did 2 workouts on the DVD and I was wringing wet when I was done.

For the last 20 years I've been doing kickboxing, weight training and running. But at my age, those type of workouts are killing me. I recently hurt my back and felt like I was 90. It's my fault. I never did any stretching so my back was eventually ready to go out. I knew I had to get back into yoga again. I was a serious yogi for 6 years but I let it go to the wayside in favor of more aggressive workouts.

I first bought a beginner Rodney Yee video to get me back into the groove. Then I read one of the reviewers rave about Sadie. They were spot on.

This gal is fabulous. Wonderful voice and a great teacher. There is a section in the DVD where you can turn off the music. I did. It helped me concentrate with her cues.

This is not a beginners tape. You really need to know the yoga postures before you venture into this territory.

My suggestions to get the most out of this DVD. Watch the entire thing before you start the workout. Have a towel handy and plenty of water. I had so much sweat dripping on my face I could barely see! If you have a small place like I do, clear the room before you start the workout and turn off your phone and email. I say this because you really need to focus on the workout and focus on your body.

I'm on a nothing but yoga workout routine for the next 90 days. I already feel taller (back is no longer hurting me) and my joints are starting to loosen up.

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to any serious yogi or baby boomer like me who wants a different workout. I don't think I'll ever go back to the kickboxing or heavy weights again. This workout is it for me. I can tell you if you watch your food intake and do the workouts on a regular basis you'll see a kickass body. I'm already starting to see a reduction in cellulite (no kidding).

Sadie - my dear you rock!",1249516800,18,1952,4.025839793281654

This one is one of my least favorite. I will say she could be a great teacher. But the flow is so slow. I get very bored. Also there is no scenery or music.

It is yoga that feels like a cardio workout but not hard on your joints (with the exception of the wrists, which is one thing I can't seem to avoid - wrist strain - but this happens with all of the yoga DVDs I do.) Sadie is a great teacher. Does anyone else think it's funny that she gets a yoga block from her mom at the end? I always laugh at that point.",1334707200,,373,3.7948717948717947
8355091,5,B0027USUHQ,"I first encountered Sadie Nardini's Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga DVD after moving to another city in late 2008 and not being able to find a decent vinyasa yoga instructor or class. After several months of frustration, I turned to Amazon for help and ended up purchasing a number of highly recommended DVDs.

Although I've had different degrees of success with each of the DVDs I've bought and really enjoy some of the practices, there are none that I've found as consistently good as this one. Being as I'm not the most flexible guy or experienced yoga student in the world, Sadie's practices provided an appropriate level of challenge without going beyond a level that I'm not capable of. In fact, I think I'm better at yoga now BECAUSE of doing these routines.

Mind you, this DVD has some really challenging parts, and I can't say that I am yet able to do everything on it. But even so, there's enough diversity here for me to customize my practice--and whenever I get to a point where I feel really challenged, she always seems to know when to let off and bring me back into my comfort zone while helping me stretch and unwind the targeted areas in a suitable manner.

I might add that it's not a perfect DVD. There are a few flaws here and there. Her oral coaching, for instance, sometimes differs from what's on the screen by several seconds, and the timing of how long she works out each side, left and right, is occasionally off by quite a bit as well. But these imperfections, to my mind, are minor when compared with the many benefits this DVD offers.

If you have practiced yoga before and have at least some degree of balance, flexibility and general yoga knowledge, then I would highly recommend this DVD. It may take you a few playings to find out which rewards work best for you, but the reward for the research you do will be well worth the effort in the long run.",1322784000,4,1878,4.4985337243401755
