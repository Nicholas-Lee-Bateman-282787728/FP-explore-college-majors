Now if only get the message to the trigger pullers and our elected officials to quit taking money and funding from things to keep the kids off the streets give them something positive to look forward to. Instead of empty promises.

I can relate to the ducrumentry.
I thought it to be very informing to our youth and others that are not aware of the true things that go on in the Chicago area.
Watching the dvd help open my eyes to a lot of unheard and seen things throughout the area.",1458086400,,299,4.084745762711864

6480853,1,B00LEJBI2U,I hated it. I thought the message on gangs was great but that's it. These women seemed to think their only worth and power they had over men was sex.  Horrible message to females. It made me sick to watch it.,1454630400,,208,4.073170731707317

6480856,1,B00LEJBI2U,Really just a long rap video in which all the people blame all of their problems on the government for not giving them enough free stuff.  Was really disappointed.  Not a documentary in any real way.  Great if you want to hear people whining about not having enough things for young people to do.,1454544000,2,296,4.444444444444445

6480860,1,B00LEJBI2U,its more of a music video than a documentary.  A lot of interviews with people who live in the area.  It makes a point within the first 15 minutes then just drags it out for the rest of the film.  It gets one star for bringing the issues to the masses.,1454284800,3,252,3.9019607843137254

6480869,1,B00LEJBI2U,"I tried so hard to watch this ""documentary"" with an open mind and not be incredibly negative, but after two hours of little or no attempt at a meaningful solution to the issues or an even half decent synopsis of the conditions that are perpetuating the conditions, I relinquished what little hope I had. There was more of a focus on washed up old heads complaining about how things used to be and blindly contributing blame only to the current generation and their lack of ""structure"".

$3 and even worse, two hours of my life, without any valuable information to take away from this supposed documentary. However, I do respect the attempt and the creators personal path to this point.",1453507200,2,685,4.708333333333333

6480875,5,B00LEJBI2U,"Welcome to ChiRaq The Murder Capital of The United State documented and produced by Slick Litt Entertainment was a great depiction of the current events that are occurring in Chicago right now. No matter what our opinions are of the quality of this DVD or the maker of it, we still have to face the reality that there is a terrible problem in Chicago and other cities that need to be solved. We need to look at this movie and decide that we will join together to solve the problems in our cities. Litt T. Spears is definitely making a positive impact in Chicago. Not only did he change his life but now he is assisting in changing the lives of others by being a trailblazer in the area in which he lives and is familiar with. Keep up excellent work.

6480879,1,B00LEJBI2U,"Really bad documentary.  I'm a documentary junky and this was just really badly made.  At times, there are still pictures shown like a slide show.  There are a few facts and then a bunch of random people saying the same thing about how they've lost someone.  There wasn't any suggestion for resolve.  I was really interested in learning about the problem in Chicago beyond what I've seen on the news but this really didn't do it.  I was so bored and annoyed with the poor production and method in which it was organized, or not for that matter, that I stopped watching after an hour.

6480890,2,B00LEJBI2U,"In a word, disappointing. I was expecting a film with more substance. Not to be. Much of it was footage shot out of a car window while driving through the hood. This redundant footage, mostly backed up with mediocre rap was, I'm guessing here, suppose to be artsy. Oh, were it so. As far as the young interviewees, the narrator couldn't seen to get past the mask, and into the tender nerve tissue. It was mostly chest pounding, testosterone speak. Never reaching a gut level honesty.
I gave it 2 stars because, technically, it wasn't bad. If the interviewer had been able to interact on a more sensitive level, it could have been a very good effort.",1450224000,,649,4.555555555555555

6480893,5,B00LEJBI2U,"First and foremost I want to say congratulations on your turn around in life. Chiraq was on point; you had a few solid hitters from the game wanting a change. What got me the most that everyone said the same thing "" these youth need structure.""  What's going on now in Chicago is something that's been happing all the time. We just got social media to expose it in the worst way. However, Chicago is a beautiful place, and Rockwell Gardens will forever be my home.

Some of them are almost babies with guns without the understanding of the destruction they cause.  No one could drag me near Chiraq; and I thank God it is not my life.  However, I would be willing to hep from afar because I do want life t get better for all the people in Chiraq.

8665409,3,B00LEJBI2U,"I kept hearing, over and over, that the ""shorties"" were the source of the problem. Maybe so, but I was motivated enough to do a little research, and in 2015, the average age of homicide victims was 28.2 (heyjackass.com). I'm disinclined to believe that there is that much difference between the perpetrators and the victims, so I think blaming it on the shorties is just an excuse for a problem no one can solve.
Actually, murder figures went down in 2004, and have hovered at around the same level (roughly 500 per year) since then, which is WAY below the peak years when the numbers approached 1000. Got no explanation for that.
Despite the words, few of the people interviewed showed actual remorse. There was a lot of bragging, in fact. I really don't know what that's about, either.
The film is worth watching, if just to get a glimpse of the horror people are living in.
Couldn't we try an experiment? Couldn't we legalize and regulate pot (and maybe all drugs) in Chicago for six months, and see if it has ANY impact on crime? It would remove the financial incentive to traffic in narcotics.",1473120000,,1098,4.607142857142857
8665410,4,B00LEJBI2U,"This film was a depiction of the low expectations from minorities that results in their descent into a into a socioeconomic and moral subclass as a result of welfare and government policies that feed the decay.  If we do not treat all as people belonging to our society of decent people, this film illustrates the result.

Obviously, there are many in our country who are undereducated by their parents and their schools and accordingly cannot fully participate in a in an advanced civilized society because of the emotional impact of their failed attempts to participate.

Let's face it, such people will be left behind on an increasingly basis unless they choose to surmount their racial and education problems..  Unfortunately, these problems can only be surmounted by the most brave and intelligent of the of their race.

As a white man, I have hired many minority people who have performed admirably and have raised their families to a level in which they are proud of themselves and their accomplishments.  Not all have the mindset or ability to do such.

It is up to each individual, no matter black or white, to determine what contribution they will make to their fellow citizens.  If you cannot make a contribution to our society, you are worthless and deserve the consequences of your worthless associates.",1471478400,,1316,4.95
8665411,5,B00LEJBI2U,This should have been the movie instead of what Spike Lee produced. I fully understood what Chiraq meant not from the powder puff piece of Spike Lee.
