1392689,4,B0000541AE,"This film that explores the lives of three hustlers at different points in their careers is dark and atmospheric. The bleak black-and-white photography is used to great effect and the images of the pimp Ghislaine endlessly circling the streets of Los Angeles in her car as she sets up ""dates"" for her stable strongly symbolize the emotional bleakness of the lives of the hustlers, particularly Harry. Much of the film was improvised over the course of a year, with director Lewis writing some material to loosely link together the improvised material. An incautious viewer might look at the disjointed effect this has on the film as a defect but instead it should be viewed as representative of the disjointed lives the hustlers, again especially Harry, are living. Harry is almost schizophrenic in his insistence in separating his job as a hustler from his attempts to get acting work. He looks upon his work with clients with a sort of twisted honor, an honor that being asked whether he does nude scenes (a coded request that he submit sexually to the casting director) is not hypocritical but instead fits perfectly with his character. While the penultimate scene is a little contrived, the film's final scene again makes perfect sense when viewed through the eye of the characters involved. This is a complex film but even if you're not into it for the complexity the performances and the attractive cast make it worth watching.",1225497600,4,1433,4.925619834710743
1392690,2,B0000541AE,"Sleazy film about an LA escort service that caters to clients with elaborate [mostly S&M] fantasies and the hustlers who work there while trying to get their break in the film industry. Writer/director Everett Lewis wants to eat his cake and have it too, decrying the exploitation of these men while putting his own actors on prurient display for the delectation of his audience. In one scene, a casting director asks the protagonist if he would be willing to do nudity for a film, to which the protagonist replies, with indignation, ""I'm an artist."" The irony is that B. Wyatt, the actor in that scene, appears here nude as often as he does clothed. Hypocrisy, bad acting, bad production quality and an absurd neo-noirish sub-plot make this film a big thumbs down. The only pleasures I derived from this one were the surprise of a brief appearance by David (credited here as Fernando) Arquette as a high strung john who has disfigured one of the rent boys with a hot iron and watching actor Alan Boyce as Dean, coyly cupping his package in every one of his many nude scenes. Watching him sweep the floor with one hand is priceless. What's he hiding under there anyway? Not recommended.",1204502400,5,1186,4.706730769230769
1392691,4,B0000541AE,"While I agree with Joe Edkin's comments regarding theinteresting compositional technics of SKIN AND BONE, I concur overall with the judgments of ""a visitor,"" from Nyack, N.J.
The film is a mix of ""styles"" ranging from the Andy Warholschool of ""Oh, My God! I Can't Believe How Wretched This Film Is!"" to moments evoking both ""pity and horror,"" the yardstick by which all Attic tragedy is measured.
While Mr. Edkin places SKIN AND BONE in the ""genre"" of hustler
films and proceeds to name his chosen few, I am, as yet, unaware
there exists such a genre. A handful of films upon a common ground  do not a genre make. A film, like a play, is ""grounded"" upon stakes for the central characters, as Mr. Edkin states. But stakes do not a ""theme"" make. What ""drives"" a character, his stake, whether in film or stage play, is borne out of the aggragate of his autobiography.
It would be nearly impossible for any film or play to begin at the ""beginning."" A plot will usually begin ""in media res"" (in the middle) and work toward a denouement with backward glances as required for an understanding of ""how"" a character's life became ""staked"" and entangled in the lives of the other characters.
SKIN AND BONE needs to be watched more than once in order that the subtleties (and there *are* subtleties) of the film become apparent. You will, I warrant, find the existential dimension of the two leading characters' lives as alluded to by ""a viewer"" to represent, overall, the more reliable and *intuitive* of the the two postings.
SKIN AND BONES holds a place in my dvd collection along side LILIES, WILD REEDS, LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! and GODS AND MONSTERS.

1392692,1,B0000541AE,"A Flaccid Thriller
This is a movie that is completely undone by its ending.
""Skin & Bone"" falls into the ""hustler life"" subcategory of queer movies.  The central character is Harry (B. Wyatt), an aspiring actor who hustles for a living, treating each job as a chance to hone his acting abilities.  He works for Ghislaine (Nicole Dillenberg) and is assigned the task of helping train the newest member of her stable, Dean (Alan Boyce).  Harry and Dean turn tricks with both women and men.  It's all a matter of economics for them, although Dean is still new enough to the business that he still gets off getting off with his female clients.
Writer/director Everett Lewis uses unconventional structure and technique to tell his story, and the filmmaking is interesting.  When the script is focusing on the dehumanizing elements of their lives and the profession of selling their bodies, it is interesting and the acting is professional, if not terribly exciting.  Unfortunately, Lewis's script takes a turn into the melodramatic (a common element in the ""hustler life"" genre), and the last act of the movie fails because of it.  I found the ending, intended to be tragic, to be completely unbelievable--relying on a character to be such a complete idiot that he didn't realize what was happening.
I would strongly suggest that you rent this movie before you consider buying it.  If the ""hustler life"" genre appeals to you, then you might want to check out ""johns"" and much more interesting (if for location and culture alone) ""Mandragora"", although I don't strongly recommend either.  ""L.I.E."" (not yet released on video or DVD) is better than these three titles, but it is not without its own flaws.  If you want to see a really taut thriller about life on the streets, although not a queer film, then I would definitely recommend ""Where the Day Takes You.""

7930583,4,B0000541AE,"A very dark film. No glamour is to be seen in this story of Hustlers, not completely aware of their position. Trying to sell themselves as actors, they slowly penetrate in a world of sex and abuse. And what a terrifying world this can turn into. The agency to which the main characters  become linked deals with the most sordid of sex desires, depraved sex of sadism and masochism, where clients demand daily more aggressive aspects of sex encounters. Lured with the prospects of getting jobs in the main film industry, the supposed actors complain.
I found the actors of the film most effective. Beside the beautiful bodies they keep showing to the camera, they have good acting and let us feel the anguish with it they accept their abusive parts, always believing it will come to a better assignment. In particular, B. Wyatt and Alan Boyce give poignant interpretations, making you feel sorry for them and hoping they can get out of that hell.
But little hope is to be expected for those involved in this hard core sadistic industry, where people are little more than meat to be served to the lions.",1479945600,,1101,4.675257731958763

7930587,4,B0000541AE,"I won't trash it but I won't praise it either. I don't read other people's reviews when I'm going to write mine but I did catch a glimpse of some of them. First of all, the woman who handles the boys...the pimp, if you will, very unbelievable, too much like a bee buzzing all around, bad actress too. Now for the boys themselves. I tried to believe that they were essentially good boys caught in a bad situation and I think I did get there. Harry, Dean and Billy are the focal points. Billy is your typical dumb blonde type character who meets someone and falls in love. Harry is trying to be a serious actor. Dean is just looking for direction. IT is a very sad ending for all concerned but hard to buy. Some laughs, a few sad moments and I would recommend it as long as you don't quest for an Academy Award caliber movie. No real overt sex that I can remember, some s & M type scenes and some frontal male nudity. I say give it a go.",1413158400,3,935,4.114754098360656

7930590,2,B0000541AE,"I like Everett Lewis' movies. His characters are always quirky, kind of at the edge of society and the actors he chooses to play their parts, are well chosen and provide great dialogue. I've watched this thing two times, and my response is that it's kind of a mess. No clear story lines about the three male prostitutes, doesn't really add up to much,
 and like a foreign art movie that is supposed to have some deep meaning, to the ordinary observer, it looks like a piece of crap.

It is difficult to have any sympathy for any of the characters here. No one makes any real connections with each other, and the film ambles along much like three semi-connected nightmare dreams sequences involving people who are on the road to nowhere. A much better choice in terms of the subject matter here would be Andy Warhol's Heat. Skin and Bone could have been a much better film. Would like to see Everett Lewis redo it today and see what he could come with. His later films are much better.",1348185600,2,984,4.461111111111111

7930592,1,B0000541AE,"A disappointing movie, full of logical inconsistencies.  First and foremost, the mysterious madam whose way of dealing with wayward merchandise is to rub them off.  What?  She kills her own golden geese?  Second: the directors obvious fixation with anal sex--including at least two totally gratuitous ""rape scenes, both happening to the ""top"" male character.  Third, an ending that makes you want to shoot the director--a total cop out in the most classic homophobic tradition.  And i could even add a fourth, a character that does naked cleaning while covering his jewels with one hand, whereas seconds later he is supposedly administering
to the sexual needs of his paralyzed client!!!!",1243555200,5,688,5.26605504587156
