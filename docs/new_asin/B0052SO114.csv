4530822,4,B0052SO114,I love George Montgomery and old westerns.  This is actually an old western I had not seen.  It is plot # 3 but I enjoyed it for a Saturday afternoon get away from the world movie.  George is a notorious gunfighter who wants to go straight.  Watching him try to go straight and all the elements of his past trying to prevent him.  Those who encourage and try to help him.  It's just a feel good movie that I would recommend especially since it is offered through Amazon Prime.  Thanks again to Amazon for making these movies available and the quality is quite good.,1406937600,,565,4.375

4530824,4,B0052SO114,"Another ""Made to Order/Limited Edition"" from MGM. And again I've not been let down despite the high cost. An excellent print (only 4 stars ""Mr Jim""?), nicely presented, this is a thoroughly unpretentious western, well directed by Sidney Salkow (Prod E. Kent), and, as you would expect, well acted by Montgomery. Ann Robinson (looking occasionaly like Alison Hayes) does her best with a cliched role, but then the whole script is a cliche, and so it should be, that's what I like, who needs surprises. No surprises then, but lots of pleasures to be had. Filmed in and around Iverson's Ranch ( I think. Can anyone confirm?) you can see how many rocks, shacks, ranch and town you can recognise. Also spot the unbilled stalwarts - Roy Barcroft, Boyd Morgan, Al Wyatt, Wm. Tannen. Enjoy the gang - Don Barry, Henry Rowland, Morgan and Wyatt. Enjoy the gun battles, chases, and fights . BUT...There is no actual ""Duel"" in Durango. Can't have everything, can we? 5 stars for the print, 4 stars for the film which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I recomend it cautiously, as it is a ""B"" film, it's expensive, and I think you really need to know it or truly want to take a chance. I did and don't regret it.",1329782400,4,1192,4.574766355140187
4530825,5,B0052SO114,"The story is well written and believable.  Montgomery plays the part of a gunslinger and outlaw leader of a gang who wants
to hang up his guns and start living a normal life with lady rancher played by talented Ann Robinson. She was his partner
in a gambling house. The chemistry between these two actors is amazing.  There is a young boy in the story played by Bobby
Clark who shows he has real acting potential. His timing in his scenes with Montgomery is rare for such a young actor.
Their scenes together show how well Montgomery could work with child actors. The supporting cast is wonderful featuring
Denver Pyle, Donald Barry, and Steve Brody.  George, who was a master at characterization, uses a totally different approach
to his character and his dialogue is sometimes folksey depending on who he was speaking with. Definitely a must see movie for
all of you George Montgomery fans.",1316563200,8,892,4.741935483870968
4530826,4,B0052SO114,"United Artists Pictures presents ""GUN DUEL IN DURANGO"" (1957) (73 min/B&W) -- Starring George Montgomery, Ann Robinson, Steve Brodie, Bobby Clark, Frank Ferguson & Don `Red' Barry

Directed by Sidney Salkow

Dan Tomlinson aka Will Sabre (George Montgomery) is the head of a gang of outlaws, who states his intentions to go straight but is warned by the new gang leader, Jake Dunsten (Steve Brodie), that he has thirty days to come back to the gang - or else. On his way back to his hometown and girl-friend, Judy Olivant (Ann Robinson), Dan picks up 10-year-old Robbie Donovan (Bobby Clark) whose father has been killed. Dan gets a job as a bank teller and suspicion falls on him when a hold-up occurs and he doesn't use his guns. Further, Dunsten and Dan's former gang plant evidence to make it appear as if Dan cooperated with them. Dan is accused and now has to find a way to capture Dunsten and his gang, and clear his name.

As this story has been told many times, screenwriter Louis Stevens gives this the jolt and gusto as he did in previous films - The Texas Rangers (1936), Colorado (1940), The Border Legion (1940), Streets of Laredo (1949), Massacre River (1949), The Cimarron Kid (1952) and Border River (1954).

8454276,3,B0052SO114,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Pretty average stuff here, with some basic silly story lines added to the mix which make no sense. It starts out quickly, like a TV Western. You'll recognize plenty of faces from TV and film. There's not much to the artistry, although the direction is capable.

Stiff George Montgomery as (Will / Dan) plays some outlaw who suddenly changes his ways and turns his back on his outlaw posse. Steve Brodie as Dunsten wants revenge. There's also a snot-nosed kid whose father has just died and was being buried. In all his heart, George Montgomery as (Will / Dan) helps him out and takes him to the nearest town.

It's all rather stupid and contrived, but it's not horrible. Frank Ferguson as Sheriff Howard is another annoying Sheriff who pries into everything. George Montgomery as (Will / Dan) gets a job as a bank and wants to change his ways but is pulled into another heist with his old crew. You can figure out the ending from here.",1461369600,,977,4.571428571428571

8454280,3,B0052SO114,"This is a classic western: a bad man tries to go good and, to my mind, has to be compared to the most famous example of this plot, John Wayne's The Angel and the Badman.  It stands up okay through no fault of the actors, who seem pretty good to me.  However, while it has some strong moments, the script meanders on occasion and, the greatest fault of all, the shootout lacks drama.  Nonetheless, worth watching if you like classic westerns.",1452470400,,441,4.419753086419753
