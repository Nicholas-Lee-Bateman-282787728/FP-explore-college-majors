8177603,4,B000NHHDYQ,This is quite funny really.  I had had this series ordered on NETFLIX for over 3 months and it said LONG WAIT  I got tired of waiting so I bought this copy.  I watched the first episode  and HATED IT  thought it was CRAP very badly constructed  disjointed just awful' despite the graphic OMG twist  So I threw it aside and quit.... HOWEVER  bored a few days later because U had nothing to watch I tried episode two (this is a 6 part series)  and it was MUCH better.  There seemed to be a more coherent thought process and the story began to become interesting.  By the end I had really quite enjoyed it.  SO here's the funny part  when I went to put it on my DVD shelf I ALREADY owned it  I kept thinking I had seen it before  OH well LOL.  Not the best I have ever seen but quite entertaining.,1371168000,,794,4.058441558441558

When I got it my wife and I watched it and a few months later watched it again.
The amazing thing is that we almost never watch things more than once but there is something incredibly compelling about this mini series. I ask myself: Is it the acting? (It's good to be sure) Is it the story? (an amazing roller coaster ride) I think it is a perfect storm of a production that brings the elements together in an explosive drama.
It is at it's soul a cop story but it is so much more with complex and conflicting emotions and relationships among members of a family all involved in law enforcement.
The patriarch of the family is suffering Alzheimer's and sees something that he shouldn't see (or should according to how you feel). As he goes in and out of remembering recent events and mixing them up with past events he adds to the suspense of the story. Right up until the last scene.
The young brother the naive policeman plays his part well he is teamed with an old warhorse partner. They provide part of the yin and the yang of the story.
Toss in an older brother who is higher up the ladder and a sister who is a public defender and you get an interesting mix. The interesting thing is that when I first saw ""Blue Bloods"" I noticed the similarity to the family in Conviction.
There are more twists and turns in this road than on a Swiss mountain road.
The suspense builds and builds.
It is unforgettable and well acted.
We just loaned it to some friends. When they return it I plan to watch it again. If they don't return it I will buy it again.
It is that well crafted.
Well worth watching.",1330819200,2,1660,4.273015873015873
