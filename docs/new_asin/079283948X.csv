142006,5,079283948X,"I first read Forbes' book several years ago. I ended up taking his  intensive selling course in California (I live in Michigan). I loved the  book; I loved the course; I'm still waiting for the movie (although he did  recommend the movie ""Stand and Deliver"" as, in part, a movie about  motivation and selling). I have also gone through and have practiced the  Sandler Sales Institute system.
Whether you feel his book is helpful  or not may depend on the context in which you are selling. I believe his  most important point is that you must sell to a prospect's hurt or pain, as  well as to his/her logic. The emotional sale must be, as he puts it,  invisible. A real estate agent selling a home to an interested buyer in the  owner's living room is a much different selling context than team selling  to a purchasing manager of a Tier One auto supplier. For the latter, any  open display of gamesmanship or obviously tired (translate: ""visible"")  techniques will be fatal. But Forbes' point is that even in selling to the  purchasing agent, and to the various users within the purchasing agent's  company, you must click into their emotional hurt to motivate them to buy,  if only to help them talk themselves into believing that your product is  the best buy. Relying only on a logical presentation of more features than  your competition will not cut it.

142007,5,079283948X,"James Woods and Brian Dennehy both shine in this thriller about a cop/author who teams with a psychotic killer in order to bring down an organized crime figure.
It is fascinating to watch the interaction  betwwen the two leads. Dennehy knows that Woods is a cold-blooded killer  yet he uses a combination of physical presence and intestinal fortitude to  keep the the smaller Woods in line. Woods' character actually tries to  befriend Dennehy but one is never sure that he won't snap and kill Dennehy  at any moment.
This is an excellent film and a showcase for the talents  of these two fine actors. I hope a DVD version will be released but until  then it's VHS only.",959385600,13,670,4.627118644067797
142008,2,079283948X,I see the favorable reviews for this book and must assume they have it confused with the excellent Ron Willingham book with the same title.  Mr. Ley has constructed book you can only hope your competition is using for a  text. The book can be counter productive if used by someone with less than  a month's experience in sales.  Most with that much experience will  recognize how shallow it is.,952905600,,394,4.571428571428571
142009,3,079283948X,"6. BEST-SELLER (action, 1987) In 1972, 4-armed-masked men rob the police evidence depository in downtown LA. The thieves kill two cops and fatally would a third one. Surviving, policeman Dennis Meechum (Brian Dennehy)  writes a book on the now 'infamous' robbery. The book becomes a best seller  making Meechum a part-time writer but full-time cop. He is eventually  promoted to Detective. 15 years later, on an undercover job, he meets Cliff  (James Woods), a mysterious character whom saves his life. Cliff knows many  personal things about Meechum's life, including the fact that ever since  his wife's death he has given up writing. He tells him that he can provide  him with an assured best seller based on David Matlock (one of the richest  men in town). Cliff used to work for Meechum as an assassin, but after  years of loyal work, he was dismissed. In order for Meechum to believe him,  Cliff takes him on a tour of his previous work and private life (Cliff's  wants to be included in the book as its inspiration). An uneasy alliance is  formed, as Meechum uncovers Cliff's darkest secrets.
Critique: There are  many reasons to like Best-Seller. It has a good, entertaining premise (a  rogue assassin on the loose), the moody cinematography (another Adam  Greenberg job), and displays a strong performance from the always reliable  Brain Dennehy. But best of all, it has what I consider to be James Woods'  best role. This capriciously underrated actor has given excellent  performances in many films including: the sleazy TV-producer in David  Cronenberg's interesting, albeit obscured masterpiece Videodrome (1983),  his red-neck southerner in The Onion Field (1979), and in Oliver Stone's  sadly neglected Salvador (1986- for which he received an Academy Nominee).  In most of his films, Woods has specialized in playing low-life has-beens,  who have few redeeming qualities. The only fault I saw in his early roles  was that they were too shallow, not allowing the 'actor' enough room to  move. In Best-Seller, he plays it cool. The character of Cliff knows what  he wants and how to get it, and proves himself worthy of Meechum's respect.  What better actor to give us a tour through the life of a criminal, hitman,  sleaze-ball, all-nice guy?
QUOTES: Cliff: ""Will power is what  distinguishes the amateur from the professional.  Do you have it Dennis? Will power?..Let's hope so.""",917913600,2,2395,5.051150895140665
142030,5,079283948X,"My little town is notoriously skimpy when it comes to good VHS finds at our local thrift stores. Most of the time, there just aren't any good finds, which is pretty sad. But every once in a while, I'll come across one that I think will be halfway decent, only to discover that it's so much better than I anticipated. These are the kinds of film experiences I thrive on, that I live for, and Best Seller was that kind of experience, a film that just took me completely by surprise. I've always loved the cover, it's a nice reminder of when actors actually showed up to take a photo for a movie poster, as opposed to the photoshop messes we get today. It's a cool image for sure, but the film still could have gone either way. Luckily, it ended up being awesome for all the right reasons.

Cleve (James Woods) is a hitman who reaches out to Dennis (Brian Dennehy), a cop and author, with an idea for a new book, the story of Cleve and his life as a hitman. Dennis, skeptical and weary from the beginning, and Cleve travel the country gathering evidence and facts for the book, all the while a powerful former client of Cleve's will stop at nothing to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day.

The Good:
Powerhouse performances. First and foremost, the film is only as strong as it is for 2 important reasons; James Woods and Brian Dennehy. It's as if this film, and better yet the script, was specifically written with them in mind. They're just fantastic in this, both bringing their very unique brand of tough-guy machismo to their roles. It's perfect casting if there ever was such a thing.

Mid 80's grittiness brought to life. John Flynn's impeccable direction serves the film extremely well, and after seeing this, it's no surprise he would follow this up with films like Stallone's Lock Up and Seagal's Out for Justice. His particular brand of gritty gives the film an overall sense of dread and bravado, almost as if the film's style serves as another character of the film. Even watching this in full frame on VHS didn't take away from it's visual impact.

Razor sharp intensity. Genre writer/director Larry Cohen (Maniac Cop, Q: The Winged Serpent, It's Alive) writes the film as he's writing a hard-boiled detective novel. It's a detective story in a sense, but a different one altogether. Instead of a cop investigating a series of crimes or murders, you have a cop/author who's investigating a supposed hitman and his past deeds to basically call bullshit to his claims of high profile murders, yet Cohen plots the film in such a way that it feels like you're watching an old school detective thriller about a cop tracking down a serial killer. It's brilliant and intensely effective.

The score packs a punch. Jay Ferguson delivers one helluva brilliant synth score for a film who's score would normally be the last thing you would notice. But much like John Flynn's direction, Ferguson's score serves as yet another character to the film, giving it a moody atmosphere that screams 80's synth, but in the best possible way. I loved it so much in fact that I immediately set out to try and track it down, only to discover that it may never have even gotten an official release as a soundtrack. I could be wrong though, and if I am, please feel free to correct me. I need this soundtrack in my life, because it's that good. HELP!

The Bad:
There is no bad. Much like my experience watching Shoot to Kill, this is another solid example of the perfect 80's thriller. I didn't find a single thing I would change with this film. Every single aspect, from the direction, the script, the performances, the action, the score, were all essential in creating a truly riveting film experience with an insatiably satisfying climax.",1489104000,,3735,4.617469879518072

You can't hate a guy for wanting respect (James Woods)t. You have to admire his intelligence and technique for getting what he wants, and flashes of sophisticated humor in the process.

You can't hate Brian Dennehy - he's got that kind of face. I only faintly disapproved of the way he solved the conflict between his duty as a cop and his duty to his publisher and his career as an author. Both of them loved their families deeply. Yet . . .

The chilling effect is just starting to set in. There is one!

142677,4,079283948X,"Very entertaining B movie about a police officer/author played by Brian Dennehy who is suffering from writer's block after the death of his wife and being hounded by bill collectors and his publisher.  Possible salvation comes in the form of James Woods who claims to be a hit man responsible for dozens of murders that were written off as accidents, all in the service of one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the city.  At first Dennehy assumes Woods is a nut but he is able to provide a surprising amount of proof to back up his unlikely story plus someone is trying to kill them which ultimately makes the hit man a lot more convincing.

Best Seller was written by by B-movie icon Larry Cohen (writer/director of It's Alive and Q) who always farmed out his more commercial scripts (I, the Jury; Phone Booth; Cellular) to slicker directors.  In this case Best Seller was helmed by John Flynn who does easily his best work since the cult classic revenge flick Rolling Thunder ten years earlier.  Flynn keeps things moving with a nice, no-nonsense style that's a perfect match for the smart script--there's no attempt to turn Best Seller into something big and flashy.  Stars Brian Dennehy and James Woods couldn't be more perfectly matched.

The Amazon streaming version of Best Seller is supposedly HD but I didn't notice any improvement in picture quality over the DVD.",1431216000,3,1382,4.7573221757322175

142680,4,079283948X,"Of the numerous films that Larry Cohen has written, but not directed, Best Seller is probably the best of the bunch.

If Cohen had directed Best Seller, the satirical elements of a corporation engaging in a string of murders would probably have taken a more front-and-center role in the plot. I can imagine Michael Moriarty as a truly unhinged version of Cleve, chewing the scenery, and savoring some of the characters more outrageous moments. That version of the film that only exists in my mind would have been great. The actual film, as directed by John Flynn, isn't great, but it is very good.

142825,3,079283948X,"Best Seller, 1987 film

This is a story about a professional killer (who works for a big and evil corporation) who wants to write a book about his life and work. He picks a police lieutenant to be the author of his biography! Is this premise plausible? Cleve tells Dennis about his career and personal life, and offers evidence that he did what he claimed to have done. They travel around the country and have adventures that they manage to survive. In the end Cleve finds what he was seeking and his final justice. The book about his life is published. Would you read or buy it? As fiction or fact? I suspect the tone of this movie prevented it from being popular at the box office.

This is an action movie whose story serves as the base for travel, adventure, and killings. Can you believe so many murders would remain unsolved? Perhaps, but a traveling killer would need local support (finger man, transportation, lodgings). Murders of journalists and politicians are more common in other countries where fascism (the rule by corporations) or an aristocracy (the rule by big landowners) are more powerful. These killings are rarely reported in your local newspaper. There was an unusual death rate among people who said they witnessed some part of the JFK assassination, but that is still rare in the USA. The movie ""Z"" was very popular around 1969, just like Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent"" around 1940. Both are very good movies but are seldom shown on television. Wonder why?",1337472000,,1486,4.80078125
142846,5,079283948X,"Being a James Woods' fanatic (and fan girl) I was awed by Woods' performance. He shows such a combination of polite mannerisms and brute violence that creates a character so likable and yet fearful that you just have to love the whole movie in combination. With trying to convince a cop that his life as a killer (professional hit man) is the truth, you learn bit by bit about what he is and what he's done, but he's the hero in the end (won't say how). I absolutely enjoyed the movie from start to finish; the mystery of Cleve was just incredible.

I highly recommend this movie to any James Woods' fan and if even they're just looking for a thriller, this takes the cake. Definitely, I think this movie should come out once more to show just how brilliant Woods is as an actor, exceptional thrilling. I loved it all the way, buying it on DVD since the 24-Hour Rental just isn't enough time for me to watch it over and over, and over again. Loved it!!!

Wow, I was really surprised what a great film this was:  of course  two of my favorite actors were excellent as usual, but the film, direction, story line, dialogue and  cinematography was really good, to the point where it was hard to believe it had been made so long ago.

142887,4,079283948X,"This cracking little thriller features two of Hollywoods most underated actors. James Woods always the 2nd string to better known actors, and Brian Dennehy who is now an award winning stage actor on Broadway.

Without these two actors and the chemistry that develops between them the film wouldn't have worked. Its an interesting story that keeps you guessing where its going (unless you've seen it as many times as I have). The direction by John Flynn is straightforward, and the script by Larry Cohen is pretty sharp. There are a few memorable scenes that will stick with you, and I would say its one of the few films I've seen where it could have been 15 minutes longer.

Woods plays the villian in the film, with Dennehy playing the cop who is now a successful novelist. Something in their past links them together and Woods wants Dennehy to write about it!

142891,4,079283948X,"Somehow, I missed this when it was released theatrically, and I'm sorry I did.

James Woods gives a boffo performance as a professional hit man, who tries (for a long time) to convince a cop named Dennis  (Brian Dennehy) that he is telling him the truth about his life as a killer.  Woods plays Cleve, and is simply fantastic.  Other reviewers emphasize Woods' performance, but Dennehy more than holds his own.

Cleve is the type of person you'd be fascinated as heck to know from a distance, but I'm sure I'd not be very comfortable up close and personal with such a violent, loose cannon.  He can be sympathetic, but just when you think you can trust him, he turns horribly violent.  Besides, a lot of people in his life just seem to end up dead!

There are some formulaic aspects to the film, but all in all, it's fresh, compelling, and the kind of movie you're going to remember for quite a while.  It will actually keep you guessing to the end.

 This movie is really a story about the redemption of the assassin Cleve, played by Woods.  The characters in the movie are given little depth by the writers, but the stars give heart to this film.  I was most intrigued by the performance of Woods.  Most actors play assassins as raving psychotics, (and typically Woods is no exception) but Woods takes the character of Cleve a step further.  Seen in the beginning of the film as a savior to the best selling author and cop named Dennis played by Denneghy, Cleve at first shows a cool exterior and one wonders if this will be yet another Woods' film where he simply gets to shoot a lot of people.  But when the character of Cleve comes to life, Woods shows his depth as an actor.  Cleve's cool exterior and successful career as an assassin masks a tangible vulnerability as Cleve tries to come to terms with his life, wanting himself to be seen by the public as ""sympathetic"" in Dennis' ""best seller."" (You see this at the very end of the film where Cleve has to make a decision: get final revenge on his boss Matlock or save Dennis's teenage daughter).  The ending is worth every minute of the background 80's synth music.
Cleve doesn't feel guilt in the murders he's committed for the cupidity of the company; as Cleve says matter-of-factly, ""It's the profession I was in, Dennis.""  This streak of sociopathic deeds combined with an obession for verbal politeness was an interesting mix that I found intriguing.  (One tongue-in-check example is after Cleve saves Dennis' life, he places a card on Dennis' windshield with the simple message: ""Say thank you!"")There were many great scenes like that throughout the film, making you wonder if you should hate Cleve for what he's done, or pity him, even like him, for who he wants to become.  Watching the complexities of Woods' character slowly unfold was well worth the money.  This film is excellent, especially if you are a James Woods fan.",1026950400,34,2017,4.682719546742209
142894,5,079283948X,"If you like James Woods, this will definitely float your boat.  Woods plays an ex-hitman, Cleave, for a large business situated in Los Angeles, which means you get to see him show his capacities to be smooth, calculating, and also emotionally explosive.  While this movie is put in the action category, as it should be, its plot unfolds itself by slowly revealing the machinations of a corrupt and powerful business, that Woods' character is trying to take down for having gyped him at some point in his service.  Throughout this development, the movie plays the characters of Woods -the cunning and dangerous hitman- and Dennehy -a just but temperamental cop- off one another. As you can guess, Dennis, the cop, continually suspects Cleave of having some dark secret or another cold trick up his sleeve.  This movie's ability to display how Dennis communicates and cooperates with a criminal, who he despises, is what takes this movie beyond bare action and into a fascinating portrayal of personalities caught in the larger struggle of enforcing justice on mega-corporations.",1011916800,2,1077,5.1022727272727275
142895,4,079283948X,"Considering the book is a few decades old, it still contains merit, if you read ""between the lines"".
First off, the tone of writing is very straightforward, reminiscent of Ries/Trout.
One point he's got bang on:
1) Turn on the ""Want"" emotions and they will buy. (it's not the presentation or answering objections, if you want it badly, you'll buy, simple as that, thus selling is motivational, not persuasive)
Overall, it's definitly worth your browse. But some of the rigid systemtic ""prospect reading"" is outdated.",1003363200,4,516,5.08235294117647

7792163,5,079283948X,"Far better than expected (I had never heard of this movie before I saw it here). After Grosse Pointe Blank, I saw a bunch of movies about hit men who wanted redemption or a life change (Liam Neeson in Gun Shy, William Macy in Panic, Jean Reno in The Professional, et al.), and this one seems to be a predecessor of all of them. James Woods is great as a conflicted person struggling between his desire to do something good, even if his motives are tinged with revenge, and if his habitual mode is intimidation and killing, like someone from a different culture (the culture of the amoral) who's had a taste of what it might be like to feel that one had done good. The trail of mysterious dead bodies and unsolved murders shown in the movie as newspaper clippings reminded me of the rumors about Hillary and Bill Clinton. Seems ironic these days, since James Woods is a patriot who helped prevent a terrorist event, and Hillary is increasingly turning out to be like the bad guy in this movie.",1506816000,,992,4.456043956043956
