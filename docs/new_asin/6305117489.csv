7883550,4,6305117489,"If you are not familiar with the Sidney James series of movies, they are actually fairly tame, with no nudity or swearing with typically good British humour though.  This particular film is about the town deciding to have a beauty pageant in order to get some tourism publicity for the town; all though it is opposed my many of the feminist in the town; and all the shenanigans that go on during this time.  An added bonus for me in this film is that it also stars Wendy Richard (from ""Are You Being Served""), who's voice I have always liked for some reason.  Anyway, not a ground breaking film, just something silly and fun to watch.",1510444800,,634,4.448275862068965

7883554,5,6305117489,"By the standards of the day, this was quite risqu or ""naughty"", but by today's standards, it can be considered quite tame.  No nudity and no swearing, so you can watch it with your kids.  The ""Carry On"" gang comes together well for this effort, one of my favorites of the series, with plenty of double-entendre sprinkled liberally with slapstick.",1294185600,2,346,4.75
7883555,4,6305117489,"Carry On Girls (1973) was the 25th in the series and by this stage, the films were not far off a rapid decline in box office takings. However that was not before they managed to churn out three more good entries which includes this, DICK (1974) and BEHIND (1975).
The film is set in a quiet seaside town that sees very little action, until councillor Sid (Sid James) decides to stage a tacky, end of pier beauty contest which immediatley faces opposition from June Whitfield and her team of womens libbers.
There really never was a strong backbone of a plot in a Carry On film, just a variation on a theme, linked by a series of crazy but pleasantly amusing sketches. Although Carry On Girls was not really heralded as one of the series major classics, it is still indeed a very enjoyable comedy that will undoubtedly satisfy any fan of the series. There are a large number of the regulars missing here. There's no Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jaques or Charles Hawtrey (who had left the series under a clowd with the previous entry - Abroad :1972) but surprisingly the rest of the cast make you over look that shortcoming. Sid James and Barbara Windsor share some wonderful scenes in this one and provide the vast majority of the laughs. There undeniable affection for each other really shines through. Other regulars in this entry include the lovely Joan Sims, who sadly recently died (1930 - 2001), Kenneth Connor, Bernard Bresslaw and Peter Butterworth. Other members of the cast include Jack Douglas who had a number of supporting roles in the series throughout the 1970's, Patsy Rolands who really comes into her own in this entry ad is probably her most amusing and lengthy role in a Carry On film and June Whitfield who had previously appeared in Carry On Nurse (1959) and Carry On Abroad (1972). The team all look like they're having a ball as fun and games played an integral part in the series. The film particularly scores well at the end of the film where the beauty contest (rather predictably) ends in utter chaos and this is followed by a fun go-kart chase with Sid james and Barbara Windsor.
Carry On Girls may not be the very best in the series but its one thats still highly enjoyable  and a classic one at that. Recommended!",996019200,6,2240,4.614035087719298
