8554861,5,B00ANSHBPQ,"On this DVD, Due Diligence: Researching a Stock, he talks about a 3-step process. He explains how and why you should research a company before you invest your money in it. What I like about him is that he goes into great detail when explaining information that a normal investor would not be aware of and he makes it so that you can understand what he is talking about.",1356998400,,369,4.36231884057971
8554862,5,B00ANSHBPQ,"What I like about this video is all the kinds of resources that you can use to research companies. It is amazing how much is available on the Internet. For example, you can visit certain websites to see if insiders of a particular company are buying stock and for what price. One other research trick that I have never seen before is how to locate former employees of companies and ask them questions pertaining to the company.",1355702400,,427,4.558441558441558
8554863,5,B00ANSHBPQ,"This video gives you guidance on what you have to do to research a stock. I've been wanting to know more about how to research a stock myself. I really like how the author divided due diligence into three parts: quick due diligence, medium due diligence, and full due diligence. Quick due diligence should only take a few minutes. You can eliminate a lot of stocks in this step and not waste any more time. Medium due diligence is more detailed and full due diligence is the serious study of the company and its industry.  What I learned in this DVD will save me a ton of time as I will be able to weed out a lot of bad investments without doing the full due diligence.  Yet, for the investments where I do pull the trigger, I know that there's a smaller likelihood that I forgot to include an important evaluation aspect to my analysis.",1355443200,,837,4.358974358974359
