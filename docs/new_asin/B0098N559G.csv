8537610,2,B0098N559G,"I find this movie fast-paced, frenetic and shallow.  Many of the choices the narrators/protagonists make are not explored in depth, and they don't stay long enough with any particular interview to really get to know the person, the place, the problem, the goal or the solution.  Why is using an LED headlamp (in a plastic casing with synthetic, elastic webbing to hold it to your head) at 4:00 in the morning to make oatmeal in the dark more sustainable than using incandescent lights?  Wouldn't it be better to use the natural light of day?  Why is using fire to heat a mud hut a better choice than living in a modern house?  Why is eating a banana (trucked in via fossil fuels) in corn country any particular statement at all?  I can think of my own answers (I do teach high school biology and have a BS in Conservation Biology), but if I were to show this to my high school sophomores, I would have to pause it every 90 seconds.

I wanted to show something based on environmental solutions, and that's there - but not very well edited or produced, and too many filler man-on-the-street interviews based on slogans.

I guess I'll keep looking.

You might enjoy this if you have a long night grading papers.",1416355200,3,1208,4.529953917050691

8537613,5,B0098N559G,Y.E.R.T. is lively and fun and fast-moving and has LOTS of really INTELLIGENT environmental suggestions and messages.  Each one of us can DO SO MUCH to change our beautiful planet so it can be MORE BEAUTIFUL. Y.E.R.T. is so comical sometimes I laughed and laughed. THANKS so much for giving all of us Y.E.R.T.,1369612800,2,309,4.722222222222222
8537614,5,B0098N559G,"Enjoy a warm, refreshing, optimistic documentary about a deadly serious topic: what humans are doing to Mother Earth.  The film-makers visit all 50 states to spotlight amazingly creative individuals who are working on varied ways to reduce and reverse the destruction of the biosphere caused by industrial civilization and western culture.  Really great fun with a spiritual message:  live in harmony with the planet.",1367452800,2,417,5.484375
8537615,5,B0098N559G,"If you're not interested in ""being green"", you will still like this movie.

If you are, you'll love it!

How did they manage to make a documentary... that's also a road-trip buddy movie... mixed with a love story... combined with an environmental message that's both truthful and hopeful...?

Julie, Ben, and Mark are such a joy to watch as they pursue their passion for sustainability across the US.  They reveal some of the most interesting people and places that are developing remarkable ways of making a positive impact on the environment.

Great, great movie!",1366848000,3,565,4.968085106382978
8537616,5,B0098N559G,"There is a lot of information in here about what's going on throughout the US about climate change and sustainable living. If you are at all interested in those subjects, this is definitely a movie you should put on your list. I hope that Amazon puts it on ""instant"" soon, but until then, you can rent it online at their website (just google ""YERT""). Check it out!",1361404800,,364,4.447761194029851
