7992535,5,B00009QGAU,This box brings the end of one great British serie based on an unusual detective inspector who brings a different aproach for murder investigations. I really enjoyed the serie so I have all 3 boxes and wished they have made more chapters. It's a great choice for people that like misteries series.,1122854400,5,297,4.730769230769231
7992536,5,B00009QGAU,"I'm green with envy at anyone who can actually get their mitts on a VHS/DVD of this great show. To my eternal chagrin and bemusement, we Brits can't buy copies of this fantastic series despite the programme being immensely popular when it was first aired in it's country of origin. Why, why, WHY??????",1101600000,6,301,4.69811320754717
7992537,4,B00009QGAU,"It's generally nice to spend time with family, and after spending three series with them, that's what the members of the OSC feel like to me (and if you're as attached as I am, you're in for a shock). I was very impressed by the first series, but the second (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Touching-Evil-2/dp/B0002XVRXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Touching Evil 2</a>) seemed a pale imitation of the original. Thanks to the direction of Bill Eagles, however, Touching Evil 3 meets--and at times exceeds--the standards set in the first series. Cinematography is noteworthy: The series is beautifully shot, and various camera techniques add to the stories. Robson Green is spot-on as usual. Even with the PBS/Mystery prologue, in which Diana Rigg spoonfeeds the plot to us ignorant 'Murricans, it still surpasses the vast majority of typical US TV cop shows. I recommend this series very highly.

(USA Network just released their Bruce Willis-produced remake of the first Touching Evil episode, and I must say that although I expected to hate it, I was pleasantly surprised. Still can't touch the original, though. No pun intended.)",1079136000,12,1168,5.561797752808989
7992538,5,B00009QGAU,"Excellent Detective Mystery Series! If you are looking for mystery films more challenging than what you see in American TV mysteries, then this is what you've been looking for. Clever screenplay writing and storylines. Robson Greene is superb as the not quite sane but sharp profiling detective who races against time with his dedicated team to apprehend sinister killers.  If you like the Wire in the Blood series, you'll love Robson Greene in this performance.
I'm not sure why another reviewer felt subtitles are necessary to watch this film. None are necessary unless English is not the viewer's first language.  I do agree with other reviewers that it is a very odd decision to release the 3rd season before the first 2 seasons. Note to the manufacturers:  Come on....make the first two seasons available in dvd format!",1073779200,13,824,5.0
7992539,4,B00009QGAU,"""Touching Evil"" was a brilliant English TV series, starring Robson Greene (best known from ""Soldier, Soldier"") as Dave Creegan, a divorsed, depressed and slightly psychic detective. American viewers got to see this wonderful programme on PBS's Mystery! segment, with an introduction by Diana Rigg.
The DVD itself is a bit of a disappointment. The are 2 rather pathetic text documents on the history of weird fictional detectives and an autobiography of Diana Rigg. There are no subtitles, only closed captions which can only be accessed if your TV has that option. On the plus side, the Mystery! intros are included on the DVD, as is access to an online tour of the Mystery! set. There are also audio descriptions for the visually impaired.
The series itself is the reason you should get this DVD, not because of the extra features. Hopefully the first two series will also be released.",1062288000,10,886,4.953020134228188
