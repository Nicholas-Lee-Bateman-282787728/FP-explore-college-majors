34857,3,0780662504,"It is more like the original series than some movies, though the monsters are a little more intense. The woodsman is a scary looking maniac that swings an axe at anyone in range, similar to the slasher movies of the eighties. The fishman is fast-moving version of the creature from the black lagoon. And the final, and most brief, monster is the flying banshee/spectre that appears for one chase scene. It scared my kids more than any other scooby doo and started to worry if this was too intense for my 5 year old. At least the ending doesn't involve any real monsters or ghosts.

I thought the creators focused a little too much attention on the girls' very brief swimsuits by panning across their bodies while the girls stood in a pin-up pose and the guys ogled them. But I guess I'm the only one that thought that was out-of-place in a children's cartoon. Still, Daphne seems to have traded her fashion sense and adopted Daisy Duke's wardrobe. I guess hey want to keep the dads watching too.

The graphics are very nice, you can see some 3D modeling mixed nicely with the hand drawn characters. The back story is kind of interesting, though I think it could have been better woven into the story if they didn't spend so much time being chased by 3 different monsters. Overall, a solid addition to the series, but they've traded spooky and innocent fun for something a little scarier and slightly sexier.",1285632000,12,1407,4.601593625498008
34858,5,0780662504,"It wasn't promised until October 13th.  I ordered it Sept. 20th and received it on Sept. 23rd.  I asked the shipper to send it ASAP!  WOW!  THEY DID!

34859,5,0780662504,"This is an excellent Scooby Doo.  It is by far one of the most faithful to the old series I have seen in a long while.  It is creepy, funny, and of course mysterious.  I like the relationship dynamics between the characters.  The updated animation and the story pull out all the stops.  The fact that the mystery does not wind up involving the supernatural is wonderful.  It is just like the old series.  I don't like it when they take something pure and put a different spin on it.  My 9 year old daughter and I curled up and enjoyed the heck out of this one.  We were both trying to guess who the bad guys were all through the show.  THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!",1285027200,30,657,4.102362204724409
34860,4,0780662504,"Well...well...well...When Scooby and the Gang decide to go back to Fred's old campgrounds when he was a kid, things get kinda' hairy. Everytime someone tells a spooky story, the creepy creature comes to life and tries to run everyone off. Yet, Mystery Inc. ain't scared that easily and do their best to figure this mystery out.

I'll agree. This feature-length animated feature does remind one of old Scooby Doo episodes. It provides a good mystery to try and figure out and is, actually, creepy and scary in some parts. However, I just wasn't too crazy about this one. Don't ask me why, I really couldn't tell you. I guess I was expecting it to be more like previous Scooby animated features and be a little more deep in the storyline instead of resorting to be a parody knockoff of old Slasher flicks like Jason  and whatnot.

Do I think it's worth adding to the collection? Oh, definitely. Anything Scooby Doo is worth adding to it. Just cuz' I'm not too crazy about it doesn't mean you'd feel that way about it. It is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless.

Extras include an episode from Scooby-Doo! Mystery Inc., some trailers and Scooby-Doo! Camp Stories. Can't wait til the next Scooby feature.",1285027200,3,1196,4.735576923076923
34861,5,0780662504,"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!",1284940800,,909,4.372781065088757
34862,4,0780662504,"Matthew Lillard reprises the voice of Shaggy, and I'm becoming accustomed to it.  The second full length Scooby within the same year is more intense and may scare little ones, but over all, for us Scooby-Doo diehards, we welcome another venture into Creepsville.

This time, Fred takes the gang up to his old childhood Camp Little Moose- a rundown, campground at the base of a dam which, of course, is plagued by not one, but three spooks trying to scare everyone off.

The peril level heightens in this installment.  Perhaps, the developers wanted to charge it up a bit since Abracadabra-Doo.  There's an ax wielding Woodsman(shades of Halloween) which I believe is too scary for pre-school and even early elementary-aged kiddoes.  And a Fishman, who attempts to grab or bite or worse, drown gang members.  The mystery is involved and takes the gang to different situations including the typical, creepy cave.

Our children loved, as is usual, the Scoopy goofy antics which are funny and well done as the gang tries to run the camp.  There's again a little tension between Fred and Daphne regarding a potential girl competitor.  They hint once more at Fred and Daphne's probable girl-boyfriend relationship.  And finally, Velma has a bit of a comeuppance regarding who's the cute one.  I think the girls need to turn the tables on the boys regarding this topic in a future episode!

Overall, we liked it, but it's not our favorite.  Thankfully, they resolve the story without going supernatural.  We prefer the old fashioned, explainable mysteries.  The extras include an episode from CN's Scooby-Doo! Mystery Inc., some trailers and Scooby-Doo! Camp Stories. Long live Scooby-Dooby-Do!",1284940800,,1687,5.057971014492754
34863,5,0780662504,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The mystery was excellent with some good twists, and the artwork was very good too.  Good interaction between the characters, and the end was very exciting. I would think it was a bit too scary for the very young.  I'm glad to see that they're going back to the old formula with the last two movies and I hope they continue.  Scooby is best when they're solving mysteries and unmasking the bad guys.  Loved the opening song.",1284508800,6,454,4.487804878048781
34864,5,0780662504,I thought this was actually a pretty good one ... I grew up on the old tv series and it was nice to have masked villians like the old days which they were straying away from... A couple of scary parts for real young kids but overall a rather enjoyable movie. Me and my son like this one alot and the silliness and scares made it a fun time... hopefully they will make more like this one...Camp Scare has a cool mystery worth solving !!!,1284508800,,436,4.141176470588236
34865,4,0780662504,This is a good story centered around Fred's old campgrounds from when he was a kid.  The mystery involves three creatures that were legend around the lake where the camp is.  They turn up and are trying to close the camp down and get everyone to leave.  The gang has to figure out why they want it closed and who is doing it.  It overall sticks to the standard Scooby Doo blueprint and is enjoyable.  The only reason four stars and this review is to let you know that there are a few parts that might scare the little ones.  It seems they were gearing it for halloween and some older kids.  There are a lot more intense chase scenes and surprising times when the bad guys jump out that will have the younger ones jumping.  Other than that is a great movie.,1284508800,9,756,4.2377622377622375

34940,5,0780662504,"This movie is one of my family's favorites!

The story narrates how there are two summer camps, camp little moose and camp big moose. Fred's old summer camp is camp little moose and now the team returns to be camp counselors. When they arrive, they discover that the camp is run down and empty. They only have three campers enrolled in the summer program. The reason why this camp has been vacated is because of the appearance of the Woodsman, a campfire legend, has returned and is terrorizing the camp. The gang also meets the attractive camp counselor at camp big moose and they discover that camp big moose is much more developed and high tech in comparison to camp little moose.

I will not say too much more to avoid spoilers, but as you watch this movie you will find that this is a very creative story. They uncover a lost city that was underwater and I found this idea to be one of the most creative ideas they have written for an animated Scooby Doo film. The animation is also good and they of course have plenty of jokes. I'm sure you'll family will enjoy it as much as mine does!",1477785600,,1092,4.374384236453202

35066,4,0780662504,"Released in 2010, SCOOBY-DOO! CAMP SCARE is the fifteenth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market. In this release, Fred takes the gang to Little Moose Camp, where they plan to work as camp counselors for the summerbut the arrive to discover that all the silly campfire ghost stories have suddenly begun to come true! The result is one of the more imaginative films in the series, with the gang battling three different monsters, discovering an underwater city, and becoming involved in a search for bank robbery loot.

The Scooby-Doo movies aren't exactly high art, but this series of movies is very well imagined, with the characters updated but still recognizable from the 1960s originals. The animation is generally good, and the story cracks along at good pace. CAMP SCARE is a bit creepier than some of the Scooby-Doo movies, so parents may want to preview it for very young children. That said, its tremendous fun, and one of my favorites in the feature length series.

And when did she have breast augmentation? Good heck! I think it is completely unnecessary. I loved the movies due to their simplistic, appropriate nature.

35137,4,0780662504,"This movie was really awesome! Had a good story line and it was surprisingly scary. So where are the two downfalls? It was pretty scary for a kids movie. Of course that's great for adults, but as a parent, I recommend you watch this first before your kids watch it, or at least have them sit with you upon the first viewing.

 The other downfall is that there is a little more skin showing here with the women then you would usually see in a scooby doo feature. We're not talking nudity, but we're talking about some pretty skimpy bathing suits. This is basically a parent's opinion as to what you want the kids to see and what not to see.  Unfortunately due to cable television there really isn't much that kids don't see these days. Therefore I let it go when I watched it.

 Other than that, it was very exciting And at times was almost like a virtual ride. It might even be worth watching with 3d glasses. All in all I give it 4 out of 5. Especially for the really great storyline!",1388275200,,985,4.274193548387097

The voice of shaggy was done by Mathew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the live action movies, and it was fine with me, because I've watched those soooo many times with my kids, It just seemed natural.. Not as good as Casey Kasem, but much better than some of the other shaggy voices I've heard( The alien movie shaggy voice seemed really forced out) This movie really held my interest, and the scenes at the lake, where we see the gang just having fun acting like normal young poeple was really nice.

This movie also contains a bonus episode, which I found a bit weird. It shows Velma & Shaggy as an item, which totally threw me for a loop. Hubby said he was not surprised by it, but I sure was!

Despite there being a bit of a deviation from the original Scooby Doo series, I agree that this is a worthwhile addition to the collection.",1306108800,,633,4.138211382113822
35211,5,0780662504,"I've just watched every one of these direct to DVD Scooby movies in a row--partly out of nostalgia for the original series (which I'm willing to bet, now that I'm an adult, I'll probably think is unbearably cheesy once I watch the ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You"" DVD sets I just ordered) and partly because I found two of the most recent reboot series, ""What's New Scooby Doo"" and ""Scooby Doo Mystery Inc."" to be really quite good. Unfortunately, the direct to DVD movies have been a mixed bag, and for me the problem is Shaggy and to a lesser extent, Scooby. First, the constant ""hungry/scared"" shtick just isn't funny, especially since it's repeated *endlessly*. (How many times now have we seen the joke where Scooby and Shaggy eat hot peppers and smoke comes out of their ears? Geez, give it a rest, it wasn't even funny the first time.) But the main problem is that Shaggy's cowardice has been focused on to such an outlandish extent that it has damaged the character. In ""Monster of Mexico"", after Daphne is captured, Shaggy tries to simply take off and leave her there, and it takes Fred giving him a stern lecture to make him actually join in the search for her. In ""Abracadabra Doo"", when Velma's sister is captured, and Shaggy can actually hear her screaming in her cell, he asks Scooby if maybe it will be okay to just sort of let her wait there until the rest of the gang comes to help because ""she'll probably be okay until then, right?"" (Even Scooby was disappointed in Shaggy at that moment.)

It seems to me that most of the writers of these movies are doing characters by numbers, assigning each of them one or two primary traits and leaving it at that, so for Shaggy we get ""hungry/scared"" with no thought given as to how this makes the character look. There is nothing entertaining about a coward who can't stick by his friends when they need him. Maybe four year olds won't mind or care, but these movies are also being written with teens and young adults in mind, and they do care. I have no problem with Shaggy freaking out at the sight of a monster--who wouldn't? And besides, he strikes me as a pretty hyper guy (when he isn't being super-mellow, probably due to certain smoking habits.) But there is a difference between screaming at the site of a giant gryphon, and deciding, rationally and in premeditated fashion, that it might be morally acceptable to abandon your friends. I simply can't get behind that sort of character and whenever *that* Shaggy rears his head that ruins a movie for me.

Well thankfully, Camp Scare finally gets the Shaggy (and Scooby) formula right. First: the movie didn't focus on them to the detriment of Fred and Daphne and Velma. Second, although Shaggy and Scooby were hungry and they weren't enthusiastic about hunting monsters, they never once ran out on their friends and when the chips were down they did their best to help. That's all I ask--they can be freaked out by the bad guys, they can grit their teeth through the monster hunting, they can bemoan whatever capricious fate constantly places them in the path of these creepy creatures, but for God's sake, don't turn Shaggy and Scooby into selfish cowardly a-holes. (Who ever thought a cowardly dog would be a good idea anyway? When I think of dogs I think of loyalty, steadfastness and bravery. Not cowardice.)

Camp Scare also gave us a nice little mystery, some great character stuff between the members of the gang, interesting supporting characters, great animation, a wonderful widescreen presentation on blu-ray, some real chills, and even the first episode of Mystery Inc. as a bonus. (Also, for all you pervs, Daphne in a bikini.) Really, what more can you ask for? Here's hoping this revised take on Shaggy and Scooby will stick and become the norm for all future movies, because although their typical antics might be entertaining for the really little kids, they alternately bore and annoy the hell out of me.

As far as the direct to DVD movies go, I would rate them thusly:

1. Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost  (great mystery you don't see coming, and I like the Hex girls music)

2. Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare (Yay! Shaggy isn't a selfish obnoxious a-hole who constantly screws things up!)

3. Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy! (Creepy bad guys, lots of funny character bits, and Fred proves he can be entertaining when the focus is on him, also I really like the ""What's New Scooby Doo"" style of animation--Velma is cuter, Fred finally loses the ridiculous ascot)

4. Aloha, Scooby-Doo! (More nicely creepy bad guys and I enjoyed Daphne getting the focus for a change, and again, I really prefer the ""What's New Scooby Doo"" style of animation)

5. Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (An interesting romp--I liked each of the gang teaming up with their digital counterpart)

6. Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire (The whole gang gets good stuff to do here, the music by the Hex Girls and Velma at the end is great. The mystery was a bit too convoluted for its own good, but I can overlook that. It really had the feel of a classic episode.)

7. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (lots to like especially the creepy zombies but I can't quite give it a full recommendation because most of the movie seems to be Shaggy and Scooby getting into trouble by being their usual jackass selves. Also I don't prefer the ""adult"" looking animation for the gang.)

Those seven I can recommend as entertaining experiences. The rest I really can't:

8. Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster (Just kind of bored me. The supporting characters never held my interest and I thought the practical joker brothers were stupid. Also, the gang being chased by the Loch Ness monster---it just doesn't feel like a Scooby monster. Not creepy enough, not gothic enough. Too sci-fi.)

9, Chill Out, Scooby-Doo! (would have rated this higher except that I found the villain's motivations ridiculous and nonsensical; it was as if the writers decided to just make the villain the least likely candidate possible.)

10. Scooby-Doo! in Where's My Mummy? (I'm sort of still trying to figure this one out. I still don't understand why Velma has to keep the rest of the gang in the dark, other than for the convenience of the writers. Too many Cleopatras. And I really detested the Lara Croft lady and wished she had gotten a more fitting comeuppance.)

11. Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo (Shaggy exhibits cowardice that goes beyond entertaining and just becomes sad. The supporting characters didn't thrill me at all--didn't warm up to any of them, although the groundskeeper guy seemed pretty old School Scooby. Velma's sister completely bored me and I much prefer the goth chick from Camp Scare as a Velma protg.)

12. Scooby Doo and the Samurai Sword (The movie sets up Daphne as a great martial artist--which I vastly prefer to ""clumsy Daphne""--and instead of giving her the sword, the writers decide to give Shaggy and Scooby the sword to fight the evil samurai with. The story bored me, though I liked the old martial arts teacher character.)

13. Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (Boring story, cool aliens. The mystery was interesting enough but I just didn't care about the supporting characters and when the supporting characters don't work the mystery just collapses. Though I did enjoy the waitress who hits on Fred. Way too much Shaggy/Scooby 60's flower power stuff that just put me to sleep.

14. Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King (This entire movie is basically just Shaggy and Scooby going from one nonsensical set piece to the next with no rhyme or reason--truly a story written only with the four year old set in mind. Look! They're flying! Look! Now they're talking to the annoying pumpkin voiced by Jay Leno! The rest of the gang is completely shunted off to the side. And the worst part is, Shaggy and Scooby set all these evil events in motion when they took it upon themselves to completely ruin the magician's act in front of a live audience, just because the guy got snippy at them when Scooby doused him with water. Shaggy at his most a-holeish.)

15. Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (The worst in my opinion; not only does Shaggy commit the unforgiveable sin of simply trying to walk away when Daphne has been captured--and Scooby tries to walk with him--but it seemed like there was a solid twenty minutes near the end where everyone is just being chased around by mechanical monsters that was just so mind-numbingly boring I literally fell asleep. And the worst part was that the villain at the end was a guy we hadn't even really met.)",1306022400,2,8546,4.729838709677419
35212,4,0780662504,"These new Scooby Doo cartoons have been hit and miss with me, but this one is a hit.  Usually I can figure them out fairly quickly but this one did have me guessing who one of the villians were up to the end (but it also had that guy who you know is obviously in on the mystery).  Really good story line and a bit more mature, something that a family could enjoy together.  This is classic Scooby Doo and one of my favorite feature length Scooby cartoons so far.

Let me set the record straight, because I have seen a lot of reviews saying this has a lot more sexual action in it than other Doos.  From some of them, I was expecting some raunchy stuff!  I believe there is a lot on TV kids have no business seeing today but parents, don't worry.  There is nothing remotely offensive about this movie. Once the camera pans from feet up on Daphne, Velma, and a female camp councilor while they are in their swim wear but I mean come on...this is no worse than other things that has happened in other Scooby movies.  Totally nothing to get worked up about, not revealing at all.  Once again, this is a slightly more mature Scooby so...lets act mature people.  The only thing I caught was in the beginning Fred mentions him and a friend trying to row up Smits creek without a paddle.  A witty pun that only older audiences could appreciate.  Other than that, this movie is totally clean so don't worry.

The monsters are pretty freaky.  Fishman, the Woodsman, and the Spectre are quite scary but not to the point where I would worry about letting young kids watch it.  Maybe the Spectre because of its zombie looks but it is a page right out of Scooby Doo on Zombie Island so if they have seen that movie, they will be fine.  But they do put the gang in some situations that made even me concerned.  They did very well with adding suspense with this one!  More believable and intense than some villians have been so there is that fun element of surprise and shock.

So, great storyline with a twisting plot, all the characters are together, good writing, perfect setting for Scooby Doo.  Its well worth a buy.  Great movie for the family :)",1304121600,7,2136,4.356962025316456
35213,4,0780662504,"Very quickly, I really liked ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witches Ghost."" ""Alien Invasion"" had its moments. I didn't much like ""Cyber Chase."" ""Legend of Vampire"" was pretty good. ""Monster of Mexico"" and ""Loch Ness Monster"" had their moments. ""Aloha Scooy Doo"" was ok. ""Where's My Mummy?"" was interesting. I didn't much like ""Chill Out."" My absolute 2 favorites were ""Pirates Ahoy"" and ""Goblin King.""

Onto the subject at hand. Fred is happy about being a camp counselor at the camp where he grew up. But at their arrival, they find the camp has been threatened by a maniac with an ax. But 3 children show up and Fred sees that they stay. (The other children have been sent home already.)

It's interesting that we see Fred with a kind of Fred Jr; Velmah with a little version of herself; and Shaggy has what appears to be a little Shaggy.

(Daphne is busy enough with her jealousy when a counselor from the other camp finds Fred attractive.)

The interesting thing about this 15th Chapter of Scooby Doo is that as horror stories are told at camp, they seem to come true. And of course things start to make sense when they find out about what had happened in the area some years ago.

I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But without being obvious, there is a good combination of surprises, and things a sharp observer would have found out.

One thing I really like about this 15th Chapter is that unlike # 8 ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" and some others, Fred is NOT absurdly dumbed down. He's the leader of the group and it's stupid when he's dumbed down like in that 8th movie.

I have seen every Scooby-Doo film that has been and out of the newer things of Scooby-Doo, this is the closest film to the original Scooby-Doo and Mystery Inc. that we all know and love. I loved the artwork for this. Using the old fashioned character looks while also updating the outfits. Yes, I did agree the bathing suits were a little tiny for a kids show but at the same I thought Daphne's were fine, it was the camp leader from Big Moose that had the most being shown. I thought Velma's outfits were adorble and kept with her character.

If you want to complain about Daphne's outfit, watch any of the What's New Scooby Doo shows, there is an episode in season 2 or 3 where Velma and Daphne are dressed in girl wrestling outfits and that is an episode I was upset my little brothers saw it who are 2 and a half.

All and all the storyline was great for the movie. Action was great paced and yes, the monsters were a little scary but if my little twin brothers could handle it, I am sure your seven year old can. The music was good and I loved the forests look. I am glad to see the development of the characters is still growing and it lets us see a new light on the characters.

But this one was a disappointment. Why?
* Romance and jealousy between Daphne and Fred. Totally unnecessary and weird.
* LOTS of skin--big-boobed cartoon chicks in bikinis--and references thereto. Not appropriate for the younger Scoob fans.
* TERRIFYING monster scenes--way over the top. Five-minute scenes of the gang being menaced by an axe-wielding maniac? A horrifying take on Gill Man nearly drowning the heroes? I'm a long-time horror movie geek and even I thought the scares were too scary. And NOT ONE classic Scooby/Shaggy comic chase to lighten the mood. Just relentlessly grim, violent, and upsetting, with fear-inducing music throughout the entire thing.
