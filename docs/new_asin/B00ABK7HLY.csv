8549827,5,B00ABK7HLY,"So glad the ""other"" Spiderman series is available uncut and complete. It is interesting to see characters not part of Spiderman and his Amazing Friends such as Blackcat animated. Also interesting to hear for the most part different voice actors portray the characters.",1517270400,,268,5.255813953488372

8549829,4,B00ABK7HLY,"Do not purchase this unless you have a multi-region disk player. This is a good series, although I like Spider-man and his Amazing Friends better. There are some picture and color imperfections in the recordings, it doesn't render anything unwatchable,  but there is a warning at the beginning of the series that indicates that the quality may be imperfect due to the fact that these are older archived materials. I don't know who came up with the title ""Spiderman 5000"", as the series is simply titled ""Spiderman"", but I can understand to differentiate it from other Spider-man series. The best thing about this series is that each episode has a different villain, including rarely seen ones such as Black Cat (Meow!).  I wonder why this series was made and run concurrently with Spider -man and his Amazing Friends. If you like that series, buy this one as well",1480291200,,863,4.824324324324325
8549830,4,B00ABK7HLY,"Great product.  Received quickly.  However, know that this item and many other older Marvel series can be obtained at a much more reasonable price (~$20) from clearvision.co.uk (the distributors of this series in the UK, I presume), instead of Amazon 3rd-party affiliates.  Let my loss, be your gain (I got sloppy let a wave of nostalgia overrule any buying logic).",1473465600,2,365,5.05
8549831,3,B00ABK7HLY,Didn't realize it was region 2 when I bought it. I'm sure it would have been awesome.,1457395200,,85,4.0588235294117645
8549832,5,B00ABK7HLY,Great dvd set.  Spiderman is one of my favorite super hero's.  DVD set was fun.  Had to get a universal dvd player to run if because it will not play in the United States.  Hard to understand why such a great show never came out in the United States.  Thanks to Amazon for finding it and allowing me to buy it.  Take care and many thanks.  I love it.,1433635200,2,350,3.9855072463768115
8549833,5,B00ABK7HLY,"It is wonderful to have these old cartoons on DVD, even if you have to get Region 2 DVD's from Europe to watch them.

Apparently this ran at the same time as Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends. I think the channel I watched Spider-Man on ran these in syndication  after SMahAF, and so at the time I couldn't figure out why they would ditch Firestar and Iceman.

These have the same music and character designs, but a different voice cast, which just seems weird.

Spider-Man and his Amazing friends was a great introduction to the Marvel Universe for a kid who grew up reading his uncle's DC comics. This Spider-Man cartoon, on the other hand, has more straight forward Spider-Man stories and less guest stars.",1424304000,7,710,4.656
8549834,5,B00ABK7HLY,"I was so happy when I got this set. I did some research and found out in the UK they call shows different things. Like over there they call teenage mutant ninja turtles ""teenage mutant hero turtles"" because ninjas are bad. Likewise I found out they call my favorite spider-man cartoon ever ""Spider-man 5000"" which makes no sense at all I know, but believe me it's the same 1980's ""Amazing Spider-Man"" cartoon that we all watched on NBC in 1984.

I bought a special DVD player that cost under $15 (They have plenty here on Amazon) to watch this set and another one I had purchased. Turns out I could just watch ANY DVD no matter what region on my PC using VLC media player, it's a free program too so I was like SWEEEET.

The DVD's come in over 6 languages including Dutch,Ukrainian,German,Spanish,French and I think even Portuguese.

The video quality is great the sound is Dolby Stereo. The menus are colorful and easy to navigate, they look like a comic book.
Not really any special features but who needs that stuff I just want the show in good quality. The box is pretty nice too. It's so cool I didn't even want to open it.",1411084800,8,1128,4.4396135265700485
