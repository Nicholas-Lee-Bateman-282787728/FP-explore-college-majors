8384201,5,B002YFN4W0,"Ordered mine directly from the source and loved it. It's a great story, great acting and kept me highly interested. Robert Knepper's character is amazing and so is his acting. I have this on DVD but may buy it here just in case my DVD gets lost. This also caused me to be highly interested in and read the novel ""Burning Daylight"" which is a fantastically written novel. I give five stars for this movie version, which seems to be a small snippet in the life, but it well worth the time in my opinion.",1437868800,,501,4.28421052631579

8384203,1,B002YFN4W0,"I purchased this movie used from two different vendors and, although I was enjoying this triple arc with the fine performances of the fine ensemble of actors, both DVD's had a fatal technical flaw. Each episode froze halfway and, jumped into the next episode and repeated the same process into all episodes. The result, the viewer is only shown incomplete portions of all three episodes, leaving the viewer ""HANGING"".
To the credit of the vendors, my money was refunded after contacting them. I have to surmise the these pressings must have been a bad batch.
Has anybody else experienced the same problem?",1423526400,,605,4.9411764705882355
8384204,3,B002YFN4W0,This is a very strange movie!  I would have given it more stars if they had more of Robert Knepper in it.  He is really a very good actor.,1408665600,,138,3.7241379310344827
8384205,5,B002YFN4W0,"This is a movie consisting of three distinct segments each one leading to the next. The first segment concerns a jewel theft and a subsequent falling out/murder between the two thieves. At the end of the segment a mysterious woman enters the tenement and steals the gems that were taken by the thieves. The second segment depicts a burglar in the home of the same woman and the game of cat and mouse that ensues when she catches him in her house. Finally, this beautiful deceiver is pivotal in the scheme of some rich bankers to defraud a self made Alaskan millionaire of all his money.  Robert Knepper as the Alaskan  and Paul Calderon as the burglar are particularly superb among the cast.
This movie is different than the usual fare both in plot structure and cast. I originally purchased it because I am such a fan of Robert Knepper, also seen in the series, ""Mob City"".  If you are interested in something intelligent, different and beautifully acted I think you will enjoy ""Burning Daylight"".",1393200000,,998,4.691428571428571
