8727451,5,B013FA0SY4,"One of my favorite noirs, and I am a devotee of film noir.  It is not possible to watch this movie too many times.

This restored edition was much better than I had expected. I wish I had known about it before. The movie actually makes more sense (in a certain sense) in this restored edition.

Really important historically and one of the best portrayals of fatalism in film noir, fatalism being close to the essence of that movement. There is even a book, Fatalism in Film Noir, which could be recommended.",1527638400,,508,4.5
8727452,1,B013FA0SY4,Avoid this 10 dollar rip off! I expected more from The Film Detective (and they call this restored!?) but this is the worst! Its unwatchable and VERY dark and fuzzy like from a twenty duplicate video tape (hell videotape looks better!) with the image dragging like its in slower motion than 24 frames per second. Amazon MUST pull this version and stop ripping off fans expecting a decent release. I have PAL DVDs that look like 4K compared to this! And they cannot blame my video device since I am watching using an Oppo blu ray player onto a LG OLED 4K TV. This film noir deserves so much better from The Film Detective. This is the worst public domain DVD I have ever seen and I have seen many. Hoping for a better print to turn up and someone here in US release on DVD. Guess I will keep searching. This ain't even worth sending back for a refund. May just throw it in the trash where it belongs to keep others from having to buy this junk.,1494201600,4,943,4.273743016759776
8727453,1,B013FA0SY4,"I recently purchased 12 Film Detective DVDs, mostly B horror movie titles and ""Detour."" All but one (""The Vampire Bat"") showed absolutely no evidence of any kind of restoration and most pixilated to the point of being unwatchable. ""The Vampire Bat"" is the only one that was truly restored (by UCLA) and is the only one I'm keeping.",1494028800,,331,4.724137931034483
8727454,5,B013FA0SY4,"As a film maker myself I can attest that this film had a tremendous influence on me...you might have seen lots of film noirs but there is a newness to this one that can be best described by what Rogert Ebert said ""This movie from Hollywood's poverty row, shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945. And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir. No one who has seen it has easily forgotten it.""
Tom Neal as the good looking loser running away when he really didn't need to, but being paranoid, scared and insecure is the recepe for a super cuck...and he looks the part.",1493683200,,770,4.354166666666667

8727456,5,B013FA0SY4,"The essence of film noir, made in great  haste over six days, but rings all of the buttons of the genre. I loved it and if the updated version were just a bit clearer, I would have awarded the fifth star. (On the other hand, maybe those imperfections were on the original film? Oh, shucks -- I realized how much I enjoyed this film after seeing it the third time -- five stars it is.)

Ebert lists the production imperfections: ""To cite out its many, er, unconventional production choices  nonexistent backgrounds concealed with fog, shots simply flipped over and re-used, stock footage meant to pad the run time almost to feature length, unconvincing rear projection even by 1945s standards,a car with the driver's side on the right -- probably the film was flipped -- etc."" But to emphasize those is to miss its great power, a movie I keep remembering. Ebert sums up those memories: ""And yet it lives on, haunting and creepy, an embodiment of the guilty soul of film noir.""

The plot is simple. a piano-player down on his luck; a sudden death; a scheming dame; the dangers of hitchhiking; some great lines -- many of them from reviewers.

-- Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you. 
-- ""What did you do; kiss him with a wrench?
-- Fate, for some mysterious force, can put the finger on you or me, for no good reason at all.

And from Ebert again: ""Two bottom-feeders from the swamps of pulp swim through the murk of low-budget noir and are caught gasping in Ulmer's net. They deserve one another.""

If you like noir, you must see this movie.

8727457,2,B013FA0SY4,"Detour, 1945 film

The film opens on a lonely two-lane blacktop highway. Its geography suggests southern California. A man walks along the highway until he gets a ride. The juke box plays a big record, the tune brings back memories. We see what happened before to Al the piano player. A long distance call is handled by dozens of operators. Al hitchhikes across country to Los Angeles. One man, Charles Haskell, picks him up and tells about his past life. Then something goes terribly wrong. Al switches clothes and takes Haskell's identification, then drives to California. Al picks up a woman by a gas station, Vera is going to Los Angeles. Later there is a surprise from Vera! She is trouble.

Vera and Al register as Mr. & Mrs. Charles Haskell. ""I'm always right."" Their conversation tells about their characters. They don't sell the car. They dine at a drive-in diner. Vera has big ideas. The monetary figures date this film. An argument results in more bad luck for Al. He leaves, but an unforeseen event occurs to end this story.

A better script could improve this low-budget story. The idea of impersonation of a stranger was used in other films and stories. If Vera was thrown out of Haskell's automobile why would she return to it? It does teach of the problems that come from making a wrong decision (picking up a stranger hitchhiker).",1473897600,,1347,4.723404255319149
