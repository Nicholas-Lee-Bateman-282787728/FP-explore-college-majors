2394743,3,B000AXACFU,"The mummified priest Aziru is awoken from his slumber to protect the tombs of Luxor after a group of Egyptologists begin excavating a new dig. In the midst of unleashing his wrath on the trespassers, he is reunited with the reincarnation of his lost love, before being stopped during a final resurrection ceremony. THE MUMMY LIVES benefits from gorgeous set designs, coloring, and cinematography, which makes it one of the more visually interesting mummy films. Unfortunately, it is bogged down by a series of poor performances and a derivative plot. Tony Curtis could not be any more out of place as Aziru / Dr. Mohassid, where he constantly fades in and out of a ridiculous accent while bringing an unintentional humor to the role. Hardy is uninspired and emotionless as the leading lady driving the mummy's desire, which renders the classic love story of the mummy films entirely ineffective. In addition to the excellent make-up and costume designs that are briefly shown for the mummy itself, there are also a few surprisingly gruesome moments hidden throughout the film. While it certainly isn't the definitive version of the story, THE MUMMY LIVES makes a valid effort at retelling the tale with a big look and feel on a small budget, even if it doesn't fully succeed in the end.

2394744,3,B000AXACFU,this is a movie about the first mummy played by Tony Curtis which is a joke but the movie is ok. worth watching as long as the price is low. really a low budget mummy movie. If you like the munny movies/story you will like this movie.,1238630400,6,234,4.0
2394745,2,B000AXACFU,"Certainly not one of Tony's best efforts.  Much of the script is laughable, but the story line is better than comparable low budget films from this period.

You know the plot.  Ancient Egyptian Princess and Priest fall in love, break the rules, get burried alive only to be resurected when archeologists find the un-marked tomb.  Like the original Karlof, this mummy looks pretty much normal once the bandages come off.

I can't give this one more than 2 stars, but it still has a spot in my movie cabinet!",1133481600,6,506,4.640449438202247

Tony Curtis shines as the Azira, the ancient mummy who just wants to have his true love back in his arms. the cast and crew create a story that is both grand and interesting but the ending was a horrible fest of WTF!!!!",1490227200,,1122,4.358851674641149

8080011,3,B000AXACFU,I guess Tony Curtis was desperate for work when he made this as an older man.  It was slow and fairly cheesy but at least I made it all the way through it.  I have seen worse.,1438819200,3,175,3.7027027027027026
8080012,4,B000AXACFU,"You know that your career is over when you stoop to doing a movie like this. I think that his career began to slide when he did so many of the sex romp comedy farces in the sixties. His turns in The Boston Strangler and Lepke were outstanding but it was to late, his career was already doomed. He made many, many great movies in the early to mid point of his career. A little known fact about Curtis, he was a crew member aboard the U.S.S. Missouri when the Japanese signed the surrender papers in Tokyo harbor in 1945.",1432166400,,519,4.2
8080013,4,B000AXACFU,"""The Mummy Lives"" is an American direct-to-video flick from 1993 starring Tony Curtis in the titular role when he was 67 years-old. The plot's typical to older mummy movies: Forbidden love in the ancient Egyptian world results in the guilty guy getting entombed alive, usually with the object of his desire. In the modern day the tomb is desecrated by archaeologists and the mummy seeks vengeance. The refreshing twist here is that when Curtis' character is resurrected he looks like his normal self, at least his face anyway; his hands look like death itself. Leslie Hardy plays a woman interested in Egyptology and she may be the Mummy's beloved, Kia, reincarnated. Greg Wrangler plays a psychologist who takes interest in her.

This is a drama/mystery with light horror elements so don't expect heavy gore and scares. While it's clearly low-budget, it has numerous strengths, particularly the basic fish-out-of-water plot with the ancient mummy becoming a pretty interesting character in the modern world. I'm not sure how he knows how to speak English though, but I assume the god he prays to gives him the knowledge/power.

In any case, the Mummy's offended by the desecrations of Egyptian crypts and points out the obvious: How can archaeologists justify desecrating burial sites? How much time has to go by for such activity to be deemed acceptable in the name of research and science? The Mummy also makes a great point to the woman: The modern world is science-oriented, but passionless; and without passion there is no life. While the Mummy is a somewhat fascinating character and you find yourself rooting for him, the ending drops the ball. I don't want to say too much, but the Mummy essentially becomes the hero in the film and the filmmakers contradict this by insisting on tacking-on a more conventional horror ending. The film was unique as it was so they should've just gone all the way, if you know what I mean. I wish they had the courage to do this because it could've been a great or near-great independent movie.

Still, there's enough good here to recommend it to fans of unique independent movies (however, if you're addicted to a strict Hollywood ""blockbuster"" diet, flee as fast as you can). For one, the three main characters are effective and, like I said, the Mummy is an interesting character and you'll find yourself rooting for his cause. Although Hardy is too thin for my tastes, she's a likable and worthy protagonist; and Wrangler is an excellent masculine co-star. Secondly, you can't beat the authentic Egyptian locations. Compare this with Hammer's ""The Mummy"" (1959), which was shot entirely in England with lame ""Egyptian"" sets. Speaking of which, people criticize Tony Curtis for being miscast in this movie and yet Christopher Lee played the same character in the Hammer film and no one seems to criticize him as being miscast, not to mention that film is regarded fairly well while this one is typically lambasted, which is odd because -- low-budget or not -- this is the better film. Thirdly, the score is diversified and all-around excellent.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Egypt and Israel.

and I think he saves the movie! The girl is pretty but boring and the

good if you like a good mystery and has enough killings to keep you
