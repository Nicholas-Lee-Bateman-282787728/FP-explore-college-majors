Files AKA James Sutton that he killed JFK using a Remington modified pistol with a scope attached provided to him by CIA Agent David Atlee Phillips is ""Proof in the pudding,"" see ""LBJ"" by Phillip Nelson p. 73. Files had too many details regarding how the American Mafias work. Files said, when he was asked how he felt about the Killing of JFK ""It was like taking out the garbage"" for him, a cold blooded killer. Files would never admit to such an act unless it were true.

Aside from the content: As far as I am concerned, people who are confessing to a heavy duty crime usually look just like him in many ways. Some of the mannerisms and physical reactions aren't something people easily & conciously manifest.

Aside from the fact that this guy knew PLENTY of details that average people just don't have any clue of, he knew many names, and plenty of details about the people. He knew a hell of a lot about the EXACT lay out of Dealy Plaza, entrances and exits, the train yeard, the exact identities of the hobos.............

7864381,4,6304138458,"I have read several books on the assassination over the years. The best was a book by a surgeon at Parkland hospital who discribed the entry wound to Kennedy's throat-the first thing he grabs-at Parland they enlarged the wound and used it to create a tracheotomy. He further describes the call from the inexperienced MD's doing the autopsy who did not know what had happened to Kennedy's throat. Also more importantly he decribes the head wound exit as obviously having a back of the head exit-I believe if you wee working on the president-actually there was not much they could do-you would certainly remember the  wound details. I believe the MD was Dr. Crenshaw. The nest best book was called Best Evidence-basically the brain might have given clues-but guess what, the National Archives lost the brain. I agree that Files seems to either have a vivid imagination or the details are factual. Hopefully more interviews will be forth-coming-this interview is credible-anyone who thinks Oswald got lucky is naive. I remeber one TV demonstration years ago where Military sharp-shooters could not duplicate Oswald's alledged feat. More confirmation is obviously needed.

7864383,1,6304138458,"""Confession Of An Assassin"", in my opinion, is just another example of someone crawling out of the JFK assassination woodwork and reaching for the spotlight.

Of course, WHY a person would want to voluntarily brand himself for the rest of his life as the killer of the President, well, I guess that's another discussion altogether. For it's quite obvious, based on every scrap of physical evidence in this case, that NO ONE (not James E. Files or anyone else) fired a ""frontal"" gunshot into the head of President John F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.

If you want a few laughs of a complete non-event, then you might want to pick up a copy of this VHS videotape. But if you want a much better (and truthful) account of what occurred in Dallas in 1963, then a copy of the 1964 motion picture&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Days-In-November/dp/6301969308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Four Days In November""</a>&nbsp;(MGM/UA Home Video) is essential.

More James Files talk......

The following paragraph is a very astute and insightful quotation from another author that I came across recently via the Internet. It's a quote that goes to the very heart of the ""James Files"" matter, and is certainly something that conspiracy theorists ought to consider before swallowing (wholesale) the idea that a Mr. James E. Files fired the fatal shot into President John Kennedy's head on November 22nd, 1963.....

>> ""JFK conspiracy believers don't care that the technical elements of their arguments are derisively rejected by almost all pathologists, criminalists, forensic scientists, ballistics experts, and historians who examine them."" <<

In other words, except for perhaps Dr. Cyril Wecht, a conspiracy theorist would be hard-pressed in finding a single pathologist (including all three of the main autopsy doctors who examined Kennedy's body on the night of 11/22/63 and concluded, to a man, that JFK was struck in the head by only one shot from behind him), or a single scientist, or any reputable researcher or historian who believes that James Files (or anybody else for that matter) fired a bullet into JFK's brain from the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas.

In my opinion, that obviously-large list of Files non-believers is a pretty big hurdle to overcome, even for the boldest of conspiracy promoters. Even a goodly number of CTers regard the Files story as pure hogwash. And yet this video program was produced and then, many years later, the ridiculous book ""Files On JFK"" was published by Wim Dankbaar.

During a 2006 Internet/Forum conversation with author Mr. Dankbaar, I was greeted with the following lovely, open-minded dialogue from Mr. Dankbaar (which should give everybody an idea as to the strict conspiracy-only agenda that Wim adheres to on a routine, daily basis):

""Hey Von Pein, another lying lone-nutter! Found an audience to deceive here?"" .... ""I am never nice to lone-nutters, since I consider them treacherous liars. Get used to it."" -- Wim Dankbaar; January 2, 2006

A similarly-silly type of ""All LNers Are Liars And/Or Crackpots"" comment was made by Wim after I asked him the following question about lawyer/author Vincent Bugliosi:

""Can you tell me, Wim, what is your opinion of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-Bugliosi/dp/1403405336/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent Bugliosi</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/his-pro-LN-position/dp/0393045250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">his pro-LN position</a>&nbsp;(which equates, in essence, to an 'anti-Vary-Baker' position)?""

Mr. Dankbaar responded with this:

""As you know, my opinion is that everyone who advocates a LN position is either ignorant, talking out of his a*s, or part of the cover-up."" -- Wim Dankbaar; July 23, 2005

And, regardless of the evidence that plainly says otherwise, Wim believes there were several different gunmen in Dealey Plaza on 11/22/63 (one of which was the stealth-like Mr. Files, of course).

What kind of losers and blind-as-a-bat professional assassins made up this team of multiple shooters? And, a better question still -- WHY in the world would a ""pro hit"" like the JFK assassination possibly even REQUIRE the use of so much extra firepower to eliminate just one nearly-stationary target?

Did they WANT to complicate their ""plot"" needlessly and recklessly with so many shooters there would be virtually no hope of having all these bullets and bullet holes in the victim(s) funnel down to just their one ""Patsy"" (Oswald) in the Depository? A ""Multi-Shooter Patsy Plan"" is completely idiotic, and even a lifetime conspiracist should be able to figure out why.

Therefore, via the popular multi-gun theory, either every shooter other than a gunman using Oswald's #C2766 rifle totally missed everything and everybody in Dealey Plaza. Or: A humongous amount of trace evidence leading back to the shooters' weapons was all magically eradicated before a single Parkland Hospital witness could gaze upon even ONE of these many non-Oswald bullets and/or fragments.

Is the above a likely or reasonable scenario? -- Only on the planet of ""Conspiracy"" is it likely. But in the real world of sunrises in the east and snow in Minneapolis in the wintertime? -- No. It's not likely. Nor is it even remotely possible.

Another of Mr. Dankbaar's and Mr. Files' crazy and blatantly-false theories involves the allegation that someone other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lee-Harvey-Oswald-killed-policeman-J-D-Tippit/dp/B000GTT57Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lee Harvey Oswald killed policeman J.D. Tippit</a>&nbsp;shortly after JFK was shot in Dallas.

Dankbaar and Files claim that a man who was at least 6-feet-2 murdered Tippit, which presents a bit of a problem, due to the fact that the so-called ""Patsy"" (Lee Oswald) was only 5'9"" tall.

Therefore, per this nutty alternate-killer theory, not only did all the Tippit murder witnesses identify the wrong person as J.D. Tippit's killer (via facial features, et al) -- but the witnesses also (somehow) positively IDed a man who was only 5'9"" tall (Oswald) as the true killer, when the ""real killer"", per Dankbaar and Files, was about HALF-A-FOOT taller than Oswald!

A likely mass ""mis-identification"" re. the true height of Tippit's slayer (by many different witnesses)? Hardly.

Plus: The conspirators have now DOUBLED the complexity of their ""Frame The Patsy"" plot by making Oswald the unwitting Patsy in yet another November 22nd murder (Tippit's). They now have to ""frame"" him for TWO murders, instead of just one.

And, what's more incredible than that -- these framers/plotters evidently convinced more than a dozen witnesses (when combining the two killings) to FALSELY IMPLICATE OSWALD in both the JFK and Tippit murders.

Conspiracy theorists would be much better off postulating that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-Brennan/dp/0872440761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard Brennan</a>&nbsp;and each of the many Tippit witnesses were all ""planted witnesses"", paid by the plotters/henchmen to point a finger at only Oswald. Because to believe that ALL of these ordinary people (i.e., ""non-plotters"") lied about Lee Oswald being the person who killed both Kennedy and Tippit is just plain lunacy and defies every aspect of logical thinking.

Not to mention how such conspiracy theories just toss all the physical evidence against Oswald right into the nearest trash bin, and for no real good reason whatsoever, other than one of sheer ""CT convenience"".

In fact, the whole ""Oswald Is Innocent Of Killing Tippit"" hooey really gets under my skin big-time. Because even if CTers want to make up an excuse from whole cloth for Oswald not killing JFK, they still haven't a single leg (or toe) to stand on when it comes to Oswald's undeniable guilt in J.D. Tippit's murder. None whatsoever.

And Dankbaar's boldness of actually showing a picture on his website captioned ""The Man Who Killed Officer J.D. Tippit"" is doubly insulting to the intelligence of anyone who has even looked in a cursory fashion into the evidence re. the Tippit murder.

The conspiracy theorists have only the following items to bolster the notion that someone other than Lee Oswald killed J.D. Tippit.....

1.) Twisted logic.

2.) So-called ""planted"" evidence.

3.) Lots of corrupt Dallas cops, who (for some reason) WANT Tippit's real killer to go free.

4.) Gobs of witnesses who either deliberately lied under oath (for absolutely no reason at all) or ALL somehow innocently misidentified Tippit's killer as none other than Lee Harvey Oswald.

5.) And Oswald-damning circumstantial evidence which -- in the hands of a CTer -- amazingly becomes EXCULPATORY evidence!

Boy, that's some fantastic pro-conspiracy case, huh? I'd sure love to take that case into court some day. ~smirk~

And one very big reason (among others) to place Mr. Files' JFK assassination story in the ""unreliable"" category is due to Files' supposed ""association"" with someone who is purported to be the ""real"" killer of Officer Tippit. Because as anyone with a brain can tell, nobody murdered J.D. Tippit except the man who was charged with that crime in 1963 (i.e., Lee Harvey Oswald).

Two additional huge reasons to know that Files is full of hot air are: his claim of having seen Jack Ruby in Dealey Plaza during the shooting of JFK .... and his silly boast about leaving a bullet shell with his teeth marks on it on the Knoll fence as a ""calling card"".

The ""I Saw Ruby"" claim is easily debunked through various witnesses who saw Ruby at a Dallas newspaper office at the precise time President Kennedy was being assassinated. And the ""calling card"" business is just too loopy and idiotic to even consider.

Any professional hit man who just shot the President in the temple and then leaves behind his ""calling card"" in the form of a shell casing with his potentially-identifiable teeth imprints on the thing must be one of two things -- a suicidal nutcase or .... a liar.

Believe in the Jimmy Files nonsense if that's your bag. But I'll choose, instead, to remain on the side of supportable ""evidence"" in the case (and on the much-preferred side of ""sanity"" as well).

And the overwhelming majority of hard, supportable evidence in the John F. Kennedy murder case points the finger of guilt in just a single, solitary direction -- toward a person named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lee-Harvey-Oswald/dp/B0002NQ92I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lee Harvey Oswald</a>.

7864384,5,6304138458,"This is my opinion.  All cons know that to tell a convincing lie, you tell the whole truth, except you change one fact that makes it a lie.  This man's account fits together with all the most credible information from eyewitnesses and leaked from inside intelligence sources, except for one thing. Files didn't fire a shot.  He was Chuck Nicoletti's driver, who was a genuine mob hit man.  Files' job was to watch Nicoletti's back.  In this story, he puts another mob hit man, John Roselli, in that role and himself in the role of shooter.  That's the lie.  John Roselli actually fired the fatal shot.  Files was with Nicoletti as he always was.  The hitters in the Book Depository were probably the two Cubans from Alpha66 that Oswald was with in Mexico.  The operation came down from the Cabell brothers through Atlee.  Oswald coordinated the shooters and to his surprise, took the fall.  Ruby did what he had to do.
Why would he lie?  It was a renegade operation.  Everybody else is dead.  Except Files got a new identity, maybe because he provided the details to the powers that be, who wanted to know.  But now he's afraid, because of the publicity from the JFK movie.  By putting himself in a starring role, he hopes to get himself too far out in public eye to be wacked.",1039305600,10,1277,4.530701754385965

Pay very  close attention and keep some skepticism in mind because this guy could be  a phony looking for a way out. I'm not saying he's a liar, if this is the  truth, then it's settled: A conspiracy killed John F. Kennedy. If it's not,  then we should just put it aside.
