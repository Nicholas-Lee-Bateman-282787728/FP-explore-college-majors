3652209,4,B001J65R70,"...once you figure out which workout is which.  I was confused when I first started working with this DVD because the descriptions on the back cover don't match the workouts as they're numerically ordered on the DVD.  It's a shortcoming in the editing that the workouts are only numbered, and not titled.  Having said that, now that I've gotten to know the sessions, I find this a good resource.  It's particularly good for traveling, because there is a nice selection to choose from.  Below is the index, as I have come to know the DVD (updated based on the comments below). I hope this helps!

1.  AM Peak Performance (Rod Stryker)
2.  Stress Relief Yoga (Suzanne Deason)
3.  PM Peak Performance (Rod Stryker)
4.  AM Yoga for Weight Loss (Suzanne Deason)
5.  PM Weight Loss (Suzanne Deason)",1242864000,68,792,4.708029197080292
3652210,1,B001J65R70,"I just got this DVD, and it's really disappointing.  The segments are fine, but the Suzanne Deason segments are the exact workouts from her other DVDs.  For instance, the ""stress relief"", the ""AM yoga"", and the ""PM yoga"" segments are on separate DVDs by Suzanne Deason that I already own.  When I purchased this DVD, I thought I was getting 5 new routines; it turns out I only got 2.  The description for this DVD is highly misleading.

The next thing about this DVD is that the set up is terrible.  On the screen where you choose which of the five workouts you want, your options are ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5.""  Once you choose your workout, you have no idea whether that particular one is meant for morning or night (there's not even a title when the segment starts).  There's a list on the back of the DVD that describes each of the 5 workouts, but--surprise!--they are not in the same order as the workouts on the DVD.

Finally, this DVD has two workouts that are geared for PM.  I work out in the morning, and I probably would not have bought this DVD if I had known this.  So now, my 5 new workouts have become 1 new workout.  How frustrating and disappointing!",1242691200,13,1157,4.330232558139535
3652230,5,B001J65R70,This is a great yoga dvd.  Two yoga routines in particular are favorites of a group I practice with.,1438732800,,100,4.2631578947368425

Just enough of a push to get you off your arse and begin to renew your spirit and body.  If you're looking for a gentle nudge to get healthy, this is a great way to begin.

You'll move on quickly from this DVD to something a bit more inspiring soon enough, but for a couple of months this will do.  Don't discount it though, because you may just go back to it for a quick session.",1417824000,3,540,4.114285714285714

Can't see myself wanting to wait through all this every time I want to use the DVD. Making this even less appealing is the tone of the ads. Gaiam as a company clearly focuses on yoga more as just another physical exercise, another way to ""get fit and look great."" I'll stick with Pranamaya and other yoga brands I like.

Once the DVD actually gets rolling, it's impossible to tell which specific routine any of the selections refers to. They're labeled 1 through 5, with no reference to the descriptions on the DVD case.",1389916800,,675,4.720338983050848

3652238,4,B001J65R70,"A good intro to yoga. The variety of instructor, location, and routine is pleasant, and they all seem to fit with my use which is a morning routine. Four of the routines do incorporate a block and/or band. Initially I just carried on without until I picked one up at the store for a few dollars and grabbed a small towel from the linen closet. The voice over is a little to into the ""oneness"" of things, but hey if you like a little pseudo spiritualism, this is right up your alley.

3652239,4,B001J65R70,"I am a teacher and come home tired every day.  The last thing I want to do is exercise.  But this video changed all that.  It is the perfect workout for after a long day.  It is a nice blend of stretch and strength for me.  It is not all that challenging, but I still feel like I am getting a good workout.  I enjoy the variety and on weeks where I don't do any cardio, I do this yoga for all five days.  Each workout is around 30 minutes and they all use that time very wisely, even squeezing in some relaxing at the end of each workout.

I know that some people complained that these are re-released smaller segments from other workouts.  I don't mind that.  30 minutes is about all the time I have and these are perfect!",1375228800,,723,4.0638297872340425

3652262,5,B001J65R70,"The other reviews commenting on the poor DVD organization are right on.  However, I very much like the Rod Stryker episodes for AM and PM.  I'm a somewhat overweight senior who would rather do an easy-going half hour daily of yoga, than try to become a yoga sweat jock at my age.  So I look for DVD routines that gently challenge but don't break my knees--or a sweat for that matter.  I should take a look at the Deason segments as well.  The negative reviews here look like they're from folks who are looking for a much more challenging workout.  One person said they work out for an hour in the AM and two to three hours in the PM????  When do they get time to work, shop, cook, recreate?  I also recommend any  Larry Payne for older folks, and also any of the Yoga Away DVD's.",1335657600,3,779,4.244897959183674
3652263,4,B001J65R70,"I've had this for years. It's an old standby for me when I want someone to guide me through a nice stretching yoga routine real early in the morning or right before bed. It's perfect for beginners, but also wonderful for a wind-down at the end of the day. Sometimes my arthritis flares up (I'm a slim and active 43 year old, but hey--sometimes it hurts to do too much) so this is perfect.

I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is a fitness buff looking for a tough, sweaty, flowing yoga class. This is not it.

I've noticed in myself that as long as I'm doing the moves and I am consistently practicing, my body tightens up and I look better and stand taller (6-8 weeks to notice the difference). Who says a yoga practice has to be sweaty or challenging to make a difference? But that being said, if you are looking for advanced poses you will not find them in this collection.

I recommend this one for your collection. It doesn't hurt to have these, if for nothing else than to have a relaxing session, or to break up the monotony. I like that there are five different workouts on here. THe only drawback is that the work-outs are not labled in the table of contents--but if you are reading this you will see that people have listed them for you, so it's not a problem.",1315440000,6,1276,4.330543933054393
3652264,5,B001J65R70,"I came accross this in a drug store for 10 bucks and was hesitant to buy it, I have done many yoga dvds in the past from kundalini to ashtanga to power and enjoy all for different reasons.

As other reviews pointed out the menu makes no sense.  On the dvd it's number 1-5 and even when you start one segment there is nothing there to tell you which one you are doing.  ( I took the other reviewers helpful list and taped it to the back of my dvd case- so thanks for that).

The reason I gave it 5 stars is because the very 1st night I happened to do workout 3 (which turns out to be the pm yoga by Rod Stryker).  I had a very important meeting the next day was excited and I have insomnia so I excpected not to sleep, but ended up falling asleep fast and had the best nights sleep in ages!!  note I have tried many pm yoga dvds for sleep but none had helped my sleep.  This alone made it well worth the 10 bucks I paid!",1311724800,4,919,3.8823529411764706
3652265,4,B001J65R70,"I love Suzanne Deason. I think she is an awesome instructor. I have her ""Yoga Conditioning For Weight Loss"" DVD and I love it. When I'm in a hurry I put ""5 Day Fit Yoga"" in and it's just fine for me. I like the Susan Deason routines as opposed to the Rod Stryler. I'd recommend for those that don't have much time for Yoga. I think the sessions are 20 minutes.

Overall rating: 4.0",1309219200,,381,4.08
3652266,5,B001J65R70,"This is really a beginner yoga DVD. I find it relaxing and I get some good stretches. I focus on listening very carefully to the instructions and only take glimpses of the tv. The negative comments regarding the order of the segments does not bother me at all; I made a little list on a post-it note and stuck it inside the cover so I know what accessories I need for each segment, such as a towel or a block.
My first copy of this DVD began to skip and I desperately wanted a replacement, so I ordered it and am happy with it.",1302480000,4,527,4.076923076923077
3652267,4,B001J65R70,"I took a few beginner yoga classes at the YMCA a few years ago. After a long absence, I recently came back to yoga to try to increase my flexibility and as an evening supplement to cardio and strength workouts. I would still classify myself as a beginner, and this yoga DVD is really great if you're looking for 20-25 minutes to wind down. The instructions are clear and easy to follow (you don't really even need to see the screen most of the time), and the pacing is done well. They have modifications built in, which you can ignore if you like.

I gave this four stars because 1) The menu is downright lazy; 2) if I hadn't had some foundational yoga form classes, I might not perform the poses correctly as the instructions don't always tell you everything you need to focus on in a specific pose; and 3) it's misleading to call routines 2 and 3 ""for weight loss."" You will not lose any weight doing this, but they are nice morning and evening stretch routines.

This is my favorite yoga DVD to turn to in the evenings - recommended!",1300060800,4,1036,4.362694300518135
3652268,3,B001J65R70,"I really like the two Rod Stryker segments on the DVD. I've not completed any of the Suzanne Deason ones. I started one of the Suzanne Deason ones and found that my Yoga Journal: Morning, Noon & Night DVD had better stuff on it.

I keep this for the Rod Stryker segments. His voice is very calming. There's enough time in each pose. I genuinely feel relaxed at the end of the segments. I liked his segments so much that I'm trying one of his meditation CDs for better stress reduction.

So I'm giving it 3 stars because I like the Rod Stryker segments and I did not care for the Suzanne Deason segment I tried. I'd give it 5 stars if it was just Rod Stryker on the DVD. Sorry, Suzanne. It wasn't bad, it's just that I liked something else better.

The DVD should have not been named ""5 Day Fit Yoga"". Maybe that would help.

If the segments work for you, then cool.",1297814400,4,865,4.192771084337349
3652269,3,B001J65R70,It is good yoga DVD but it could be better. It could be more variable and I need a little harder level. It is not exactly what I was looking for. Not challenging enough for me. Thank you.,1297468800,,187,3.9473684210526314
3652300,1,B001J65R70,"I have practiced a little yoga over the years and was never much of a fan, however when I noticed I had lost a lot of flexibility I decided it was time to come back and sadly I picked this dvd.  First of all, the ""style"" is all wrong for me--they talk through the entire session and move through the poses very quickly.  What ever happened to ""hold""?  Also, I only realize NOW, after reading these reviews, that this is their ""greatest hits"" packaged for extra revenue.  Gaiam will get no more ""revenue"" from me.",1295222400,,512,4.3578947368421055
3652301,1,B001J65R70,"This DVD should come with a disclaimer that it is only suitable for beginners or elderly. The so-called ""weight loss"" segments didn't get my heart rate up at all and almost put me to sleep. The ""chapters"" are really difficult to figure out as they are not labeled and the voice over doesnt tell you which segment you are doing. Instead of buying this horrible DVD, sit in front of a picture of the ocean, play some Enya and try to touch your toes.",1290902400,,447,4.333333333333333
3652302,5,B001J65R70,"This is a great packaging of quite a few old Gaiam VHS tapes on one Dvd, making it quite a space-saver for someone who had all the original videotapes. Two of the tapes, Rod Stryker's Am Yoga & Pm Yoga, have never before been released on DVD (they are #1 & #2 on the DVD). Those 2, along with Stress Relief Yoga (#3), are three of my most-used yoga videos and I hated constantly rewinding & fastforwarding the parts that I needed.

This is a relatively easy, true beginner's DVD. I have no complaints with that because I have fibromyalgia and I like to have some form of exercise every day but intense exercise will cause me to have severe bounce-back pain and stiffness. These sessions are a true relaxing joy for a beginner or person with limited mobility or ability - or someone who wants relaxation or stretching after other types of vigorous exercise.

So many people now expect yoga to be sweaty pushups - they've forgotten to just breathe, relax, and enjoy the joy of stretching and feeling their bodies. I love this DVD and I have been doing yoga for over 20 years. Because I also like to do other types of exercise often on the same day, these 20-30 minute yoga sessions are often just the right thing.",1290124800,17,1211,4.45045045045045
3652303,3,B001J65R70,"Luckily, I had the expertise of previous viewers to guide me through the DVD.  I find the evening workouts very good for stress reduction and relaxation.  The use of the props is a bit annoying, as many people do not have these rather pricey specialty items.  But my bathrobe tie, a folded tank top and a rolled blanket have worked just fine as the yoga strap, the fancy eye pillow, and the wedge used in the dvd.  My only complaint is that the incorporation of the breath is not more of a focus in the pm segments.  This aspect is put in almost as an afterthought, and is not  consistent throughout the practice.  This does not encourage the deep relaxation that the instructors are trying to achieve with the pm segments.",1270771200,2,723,4.473282442748092
3652304,5,B001J65R70,"I just thought I'd update my review now that I have had the dvd for a few months. It's still fantastic (my favorite workout is the stress reliever) and making it so I can make it through each day! I'm not sick of any of the workouts, and I do one almost every morning on a regular basis which is unusual for me! ********** (There's my 10 stars!)

I give this tape 5 stars and would give it 6 or even 10 if I could. I hurt my back last spring not stretching after going to the gym combined with too many hours on my computer and all of my medical advice was to stretch and do yoga. Frustrated trying to fit an hour or hour and half long class into my week, I started looking for dvds to try at home on a regular basis. This is the perfect video, with 2 am, 2 pm, and a special stress reliever routine all of which are roughly a half hour. It's easy to start the day with a routine, or get in a stretch after a workout. I am already feeling the positive effects of incorporating yoga into my daily routine! and I haven't even tried all the workouts yet! I think this is a great video for beginners or people who just need to get the squeaks out in the morning or evening that doesn't consume huge blocks of time. Suzanne Deason of course is one of my all time favorite instructors, and Rod Stryker is good as well. They keep you moving, without having to hold the poses too long and manage to get all your muscles loosened up in a short period of time. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to enjoy some basic stretching into their week.",1259107200,5,1541,4.085808580858086
3652305,1,B001J65R70,I would not recommend this video to anyone.  The segments are not in the same sequence as the sleeve which makes it frustrating to figure out which workout is which.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.,1258934400,,222,4.525
3652306,1,B001J65R70,"I concur with others who have given this DVD low ratings.

If I had seen these reviews I wouldn't have bother with this DVD. To reiterate, the menu screen is only numbers 1-5, which are in a different order than what is on the box. Entirely frustrating for something that is meant to be relaxing!

The workouts were very rushed and poses were not held very long at all. Holding poses and feeling your emotions through the poses with steady breathing is so important and the entire reason that I do yoga- not for some simple stretching one after the other with no space in between. Having to pause the video multiple times is not good.

At the end of one sequence, savasana (corpse pose) isn't more than a minute or two. Sure you could lay there for as long as you want (10-15 minutes minimum)... but they don't instruct you to do so. Without an extended savasana, yoga cannot have its full relaxing/restorative effects. A yoga practice is not complete without extended savasana (yes, just lying there on the floor!)

While the DVD is not geared at ""beginners"" specifically, it is poor judgement to assume everyone who buys this DVD has knowledge on how to experience and do yoga.",1257120000,3,1179,4.6
3652307,3,B001J65R70,"I agree this is a poorly presented re-release of 5 20-27 min. sessions by Susan Deason & Rod Stryker.
Straight from Gaiam's site, the order of ""workouts"" (Way too easy to be considered such), are:
1. A.M. Peak Performance Yoga - Focus w/Rod Stryker (2003)
2. Stress Relief Yoga w/Susan Deason (1998)
3. P.M. Peak Performance Yoga - Stress Relief w/Rod Stryker (2003)
4. A.M. Yoga - Conditioning For Weight Loss w/Susan Deason (1999/2002)
5. P.M. Yoga - Conditioning For Weight Loss w/Susan Deason (1999/2002)

The list on the back of the DVD case lists them in a different order which makes no sense. The reason there is no intro was because when filmed, the intros were also a different section/menu choice. But they still could have included them or at least have identified them somehow. On Susan's Stress Relief, there is more content then just the 20 min here & on her Weight Loss, there is 20 min. Breathwork that goes deeper & is more of a workout, though still easy.

These are professionally done, beautiful outdoor scenes, all were originally on VHS as well & re-released on DVD previously except Rod's AM/PM which never was until now & is still is listed on VHS here. (This is not his Longevity DVD version.) You can check reviews for content.
None of these are going to make you sweat or work your muscles, or lose weight unless you are obese (>30 BMI). They are mostly relaxation poses w/a few triangles, lunges, side angles, chair & maybe a warrior thrown in, 1 standing pose per workout almost.
This is for beginners to yoga, those just starting to workout & don't want anything that will be daunting, those who are inflexible or limited endurance due to health issues, or those looking only for slow, careful, easy relaxation only.
Susan Deason & Rod Stryker's style is not flowing, more a stretching ""workout"", very different from Rodney Yee's who's more fluid in both how he decides the order in the poses as well as his teaching style that is more mind/body while Susan's & Rod's comes off more stiff & only about the physical ability.

Copy of my 7/23/07 review for VHS A.M. Peak Performance - Focus w/Rod Stryker:
Fusha wrote a great review. This is set right at a Maui beach by the rocks with the water spraying nicely. The music is very light, like Kenny G type light sounds.
He does not say the Sanscrit names & talks as minimally as possible about how to do the pose right & barely mentions how they benefit the body. He doesn't use any new age lingo.
He does the poses one at a time like a gym session, w/o flow & goes into seated or basic stand to rest in between. He starts off easily, does the pose very modified a few times before actually doing the pose fully. Each pose is only held a few seconds then given a rest & repeated or to the next pose. There are no sun salutations.
Considering it's only 25 min, he does a considerable amount of poses such as upward dog, downward dog, upward dog, locust, cat/cow, chair, lunges, triangle, modified side angle, seated spinal twist, sitting straight leg single & double leg fwd bend. (not in that order)
I did this after being awake about an hour & found it too easy. My endurance isn't that good, but my flexibility is above average. I found myself annoyed at the lack of flow, light/non deep beat music & stiffly executed intention of the poses. I did held a pose longer while he went in/out of the next pose or did other ones to stretch out more since I had limited time before rushing for an appt. I did not sweat at all or feel anything other then enjoyment for being stretched out & getting more circulation from physical work rather then being lazy.
This would be good for beginners if he gave more detailed instruction. For those looking for a very short & easy session w/decent amount of poses, this is for you.

3652308,1,B001J65R70,"As the other reviewers have posted this DVD is plagued with problems, from the poor presentation to the actual workouts. The order of the workouts are totally wrong according to the sleeve, in addition the workouts are just poorly described and feel rushed all throughout. I did 2 of the workouts back to back and did not break a sweat at all, so to say that they will keep you fit...maybe you can do them right before bedtime and maybe they will make you feel a tad limber...SAVE YOUR MONEY...THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS OUT THERE!!!",1247529600,2,532,4.610526315789474

So I'm always on the lookout for some nice PM yoga DVDs.  Yoga is the perfect way to wind down the day (actually, it's also a good way to start the day)

As soon as this DVD started I was in for disappointment. First off, the title screen is bare bones ans is simply numbered with 1,2,3,4,5 exercise designations. There is no indication what the numbers mean. And the numbers on the DVD title screen do not coincide with the exercise order listed on the back of the DVD box. And finally, the DVD has no extras. Nada.

Okay, so they skimped on the frills. All could be saved if the workouts are any good. I can not speak for the AM workouts but PM workouts were nothing but some gentle stretching. And worse of all this gentle stretching did not induce the sense of calm and well being I was looking for with my last workout of the day.

I really hate giving these fine people such a poor score but this product not only failed in its presentation but the actual product itself did not work for me at all. BTW, I accidentally played one AM yoga session and the only difference was the use of blocks (none in the AM)

On the bright side, I will continue to search for more PM yoga DVDs. I like doing that.",1246060800,12,1355,4.117424242424242
