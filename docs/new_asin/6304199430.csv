You can count on this series to be totally clean and worth your time watching.",1356912000,,170,4.28125

805171,5,6304199430,"the entire 'wilderness family' series, plus 'across the great divide' are wholesome family entertainment, without getting sappy.  they are interesting for everyone, including adults.
i remember robert logan from '77 sunset strip' and was happy to see him writing such wonderful stories.
these movies are timeless.

805262,4,6304199430,"I  like the 3 movie to but not as much as the other two. I wish they had 4th,movie out with boomer finding a women to marry",1448841600,,123,3.5555555555555554
805263,4,6304199430,"Good movie from childhood however as an adult ...the storyline of the family selling everything and buying a place in the mountains is contradicted in this 3rd movie of the series when they rewrite the family's story having them inherit the ""mining claim"" that allows them to stay on the land that the government ownes.  The first movie was based on a true story... The second followed suit... The third does not...but still worth the watch if you or your kids like the wilderness family.",1447632000,,488,4.741176470588235

805265,4,6304199430,A childhood favorite of mine--a good family movie. Due to some animal scenes it may not be good for small children.,1444262400,,115,4.523809523809524

805268,4,6304199430,"My kids really enjoyed it - they are 8 and 11.  I remember the Wilderness Family from my youth.  I crack up at the clothes and the total 70's style drama, but don't need to worry about exposing my kids to any inappropriate language or sex scenes.  They love the animal adventure and animal fight scenes, which are not at all bloody.",1438300800,,332,4.32258064516129
805269,4,6304199430,"Good family movie for the most part, 1 questionable scene where mom, teen sister, and little brother are clearly taking a bath together in an outside tub.  Understandable given their circumstances - no anatomy shown, but obviously not wearing any clothes, but made my older (8ish) kids do a double take and ask questions.  Great series on the whole though.",1438214400,,356,4.916666666666667

805374,4,6304199430,"I loved this series so much as child and never knew there was a third movie.  It was quite entertaining to see the ""Final Chapter"".  These movies always made me long for a lifestyle hard to attain in this electronic day and age, even more so twenty years later than when first watching the movies as a child.  Reminds us of the pleasures of simple life and importance of being a family.",1419379200,,386,4.333333333333333

805376,5,6304199430,"I am a huge fan of The Wilderness Family. They are a down Home, Moral, good Family. The Adventures are really fun to watch. There are two more movies that are before this one. I would consider this to be like a modern day Little House Family. We would Love to go on vacation to Alaska one day and Camp out in a Cabin in the woods ourselves. Makes for a Great Family Movie Night at Home. Love Survival Movies.",1414368000,,408,4.1125
805377,5,6304199430,Awesome!  To bad things can not be the enjoyable living off the land now.,1407888000,,73,4.214285714285714
805378,5,6304199430,"It is really sad that there are not more films like this on television.  I know they are expensive to make because of the remote locations they have to go to, to make them.  I was a big fan of Grizzly Adams, because of the outdoors, the nature, the attempt to be one with the animals.  I know there are wide open places were it is possible to live like this, no phone and very little ways to communicate, you are on your own and it is up to you to survive.",1399507200,,456,3.9347826086956523
805439,3,6304199430,"As a long time Wilderness Family fan, I didn't love this third film. The filming was updated, which is nice, but there was a lot of oddly placed music throughout it that didn't seem to fit well. Not as many animal encounters as natural disasters. Also, as a minor thing, it bothers me when story lines don't match up all the way through a series lol. Not a big deal at all but in this one, the family ""inherited"" their cabin and land from Skip's uncle and have to prove that it was properly claimed. In the first one, the family ""sells all that they have to buy some land and live off it"", they don't even know who the previous cabin owner was in the first one. Boomer tells them about him. A minor criticism really haha. It is a fine movie to watch if you like the Wilderness Family Adventures but my kids LOVED the first one because it moves fairly quickly and has a lot of action in it. Lots of animal encounters. The second one has a little less of that but they still enjoyed it, just not quite as much. The third one they still claim to like but every time they watch it they get bored about half way through it and walk away lol. My own feelings are the same. So, not as good as the first, but still fun if you want to see the wrap up.",1391644800,5,1242,4.073469387755102
805440,3,6304199430,"The third in the series gets waaaaaaaaay off track.  Yean the storyline is still there with working with and against nature.  But here comes the government and it gets a bit heavy.  Add to that some strange scenes - everyone naked in the hot tub, Boomer seemingly coming on to the girl - and it's not nearly as good as parts 1 and 2.  No wonder there was never a part 4!",1384732800,5,370,4.097222222222222
805441,1,6304199430,Waste of time. The storyline and acting were awful. The first one was the best and the second one was okay but this one wasn't worth seeing.,1380412800,2,140,4.222222222222222
805442,5,6304199430,This is a great show and a reason we don't watch much broadcast TV.  what is on TV anymore is just garbage with no moral values like this show.  We will be buying all the episodes and not worring about our children watching them as much as they want.,1373155200,2,250,4.081632653061225

7864393,5,6304199430,Amazing movie encourages great family values teamwork and togetherness just like a family should be a good old wholesome family show I wish more movies today we're truly family friendly as most of them sadly aren't including Disney and cartoons they always seem to have some inappropriate for children adult read between the lines inappropriate behavior I remember watching this as a kid with my grandparents 20 years ago and sharing it with my family and my two girls when they are about five and we still enjoy watching this series today we too are a family that fishes and goes on picnics and tries are best to have good ole fashioned wholesome family values but it's hard in this day and age when everything seems to be about gangs and murderer and zombies and inappropriate things I'm glad I moved my family to the country when my girls were three and for years old now they're 16 and 17 and thankfully growing up to be smart amazing young women and it all started with Good Ole wholesome family values from Good Ole wholesome family movies that I was taught to live by as a kid as where my grandparents cast and their parents I can't imagine what this world is going to be like by the time my grandkids are great grandkids come along this movie and ones like it or truly must see,1516406400,,1285,4.472340425531915
7864394,2,6304199430,"The scenery is the star here.  The plot is jerky and barely existent and the characters are spotty and not well fleshed out.  This movie, while likely inoffensive for families, isn't anything worth buying.  Instead, invest in a nice nature documentary about the Rockies and enjoy that.  You won't be distracted by this goofy family (who runs out of their cabin jumping up and down and cheering on every conceivable occasion) and you'll enjoy more of the stunning scenery.",1475366400,,471,4.924050632911392
