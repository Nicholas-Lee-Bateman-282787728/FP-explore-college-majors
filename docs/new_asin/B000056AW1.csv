1396468,1,B000056AW1,"To call this movie ""boring"" would be like calling Sadam Hussein ""cranky"". Words pale in the face of such horror! THE SNOW CREATURE is a sub-zero budget ""monster"" movie with a tall guy in fuzzy clothes standing in for the monster. He's supposed to be a yeti / bigfoot / abominable snowman, but is more like a  wookie / teddy-man in need of a good long bath. Yes, he kills someone (in a boring way), which leads a group into the mountains to track him down. We get to see the creature dance back and forth, in and out of the shadows, over and over, until our heads want to spin off! Wilder used the same shot of the beast coming at us some 13-14 times!  Somehow, the creature ends up back in LA (I fell asleep during it's transport), escapes, and roams around aimlessly. My advice? Stay away! For God's sake, stay away...",1080432000,11,819,4.311688311688312
1396469,2,B000056AW1,"'The Snow Creature' is one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen. The film has a terrible script, incredibly inept editing (and the print itself is in rough shape), horrible acting, and a Yeti with an obvious case of mange. The first 45 minutes or so of the film you see a couple of American scientists and their guides wandering around the Himalayas, and when I say wandering, that is almost all you see...men walking around. They walk up hills! They walk down hills! They walk on level terrain! It is quite an adventure, indeed.
They finally find the Yeti, which will make you laugh with his ferocious muttonchop sideburns and afro. Of course they decide to take a cue from every escaped monkey movie ever made and transport him (in a custom made refrigerator!) back to Los Angeles, where he terrorizes the greater Los Angeles sewer system for the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. Returning to his earlier thematic device, Director W. Lee Wilder takes tedium and boldly mixes it with unscariness by featuring, yes, you guessed it, MORE walking around, this time in the sewers. I am curious how much of the 69 minute running time of the film is shots of guys walking around. I thought about re-watching it and timing this, but that would be too insufferable, so I offer this estimate: 55 minutes or so are exciting walking around shots. Comically, the Yeti escapes while it is detained at LAX by an alert INS official (!) who is trying to correctly ascertain his immigration status! If only the INS was so thorough today!
I gave this thing two stars, but it probably deserves about one and a half stars. There are a few amusing campy moments in here, but not enough to make the pain worthwhile.",1079049600,,1712,4.579804560260587
1396470,2,B000056AW1,"When your name is Billy Wilder, the movies associated with you are ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Stalag 17."" However, when you're his less talented brother, W. Lee Wilder, movies such as this are what constitutes your legacy.
Made right after two previous attempts at science-fiction (""Phantom From Space"" and ""Killers From Space""), ""Snow Creature"" is actually the best of the three, and that's not saying much considering the other two.
Given the title, the plot shouldn't be hard to guess. Yep, it's about the Abominable Snowman. He's captured alive and taken to Los Angeles, where (naturally) he escapes and proceeds to run amok until the final minutes when he and the audience are put out of their misery.
Given the plodding direction and routine B-movie acting (Billy Wilder was said to have referred to his brother as a ""dull s.o.b.""), the only interest becomes the creature itself. And the great thing about the creature is that it looks nothing like we would expect a Yeti to look. Instead, it looks like one of the mutants from ""Invaders From Mars"" wearing a flannel costume but replete with mask.
If you enjoy psychotronic movies, then this is for you, especially considering the price. And at this price, don't expect a remastered picture. Not that the picture quality is bad, but what you see is what you get.
And if you're not a psychotronic film fan . . . dial on, if only to save yourself the boredom..",1047945600,3,1411,4.786885245901639
1396471,3,B000056AW1,"W. Lee Wilder, the considerably less-gifted brother of Billy Wilder, is the director responsible for this tacky abominable-snowman non-epic from 1954 that manages, every once in a while, to look like an actual movie, but which mostly serves as a model of the least-interesting-approach school of filmmaking.  I would cite the mundane camera set-ups, the inadequate lighting, the nonfunctional dialogue that goes on forever, and the ill-fitting, fuzzy long-underwear snowman suit as prime examples of this school.  Bad-cinema buffs might point to other morsels of ineptitude, such as the monster rampage that resembles a run-of-the-mill nighttime ""Cops"" sequence played in very slow motion, or the Chaplinesque monster-in-the-tent scene near the beginning.  Whatever the case, this is very enjoyable bad cinema, funny in nearly every detail, even if it does manage, somehow, to maintain a certain level of suspense.  Be warned, though--one person's camp is another person's exercise in boredom.  ""The Snow Creature"" functions very well on both levels.",980035200,2,1050,5.620253164556962

1396491,2,B000056AW1,"I loved Hammer's ""The Abominable Snowman"" film that came out a few years after this, but this film even sounded better so I bought it... that was a mistake. The film was almost dreadful. The only good stuff in the film was towards the end. The film had a good concept, but was terribly executed. The acting was dreadful, and so were the special effects. The yeti wasn't even that scary. The characters had very little characterization, and the second half of the film didn't even have the same characters in it that were in the first half. For a 70-minute movie, it seemed to drag on forever. And just when the film finally starts to get exciting, it ends.

1396496,2,B000056AW1,"When you are seeking exciting adventures in botany in the Himalayas, I bet you never thought you would run into a Yeti.  Become a botanist, see the world, and be attacked by imaginary creatures!  You will find all this excitement and more in this movie.

Dr. Frank Parrish (Paul Langton, who saw much better days in movies such as ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""They Were Expendable"") leads an expedition into the Himalayas to collect samples of possibly undiscovered plants.  Veteran photographer and alcoholic Peter Wells (Leslie Denison) accompanies Dr. Parrish.  Things seem to be going well until a guy in a costume that appears to have seen better days kidnaps the young, beautiful wife of Sherpa guide Subra (Teru Shimada).  As you can probably understand, neither Parrish nor Wells believes that the Yeti exists, and they insist the expedition continue as originally planned.  However, Subra has other plans, and takes over the expedition.  The excitement really mounts now!

The expedition goes up hills.  The expedition goes down hills.  Sometimes the expedition goes up a hill for a while, and then goes down the same hill so that they can go up another hill.  Occasionally the expedition stops so that the lead characters can utter chilling dialogue.  You hope your eyes can remain unglazed long enough to get to the end of the movie.

After nearly being killed by a Yeti, the expedition finds a cave containing a Yeti family.  In a moment of insanity, the male Yeti causes a cave-in that kills his Yeti wife and Yeti child, and leaves him stunned.  Apparently Yeti are not any brighter than some people.  The expedition captures the Yeti, and after a fierce struggle, Dr. Parrish regains control of the expedition from Subra.

Dr. Parrish has the Yeti shipped to Los Angeles in a refrigerated box about the size of a phone booth.  The box includes a window that the Yeti is unable to break for some reason.  Immigration has the Yeti held in storage while determining its classification (early Homeland Security types trying to figure out if the Yeti was a terrorist).  The Yeti (can you see this coming?) escapes.  After killing a girl for no apparent reason, the Yeti wanders around Los Angeles while the police are clueless.  The police finally figure out that the Yeti is hiding in the sewers, much like the ants in ""Them!"" which was released months earlier the same year.

After an exciting and thrilling chase through the sewers of Los Angeles the climax of the movie is reached, and viewers are left with but one word to say:  Huh?

This movie has so many problems that it is a comedy.  The scenes of the Yeti are replayed over and over again.  Seriously, the same identical scenes of the Yeti moving forward and backward are played again and again.  Maintaining efficiency, other scenes are used over again as well.  For example, the same scene of motor cycle police roaring by was used at least twice.  Some of the up and down hill action by the expedition I thought might have been used twice, but I did not look.  To keep from spending too much money on special effects, the director only showed the Yeti in low light or partially obscured.  In a way we should be glad, because the Yeti costume looked like a fur coat that had seen better days.  I will not mention the policeman shooting a gun with his middle finger in one scene and then holding his index finger on the trigger in the next scene.  And what is up with all the Japanese characters in Nepal or China, or wherever the heck these people were?

This movie by W. Lee Wilder, older brother of the famous director Billy Wilder, came on the heels of such classics as ""Phantom from Space"" and ""Killers from Space.""  Sad to say, both those movies were better than this one, with each being progressively worse than the one just prior.  I have to wonder how bad ""Manfish (1956)"" was.

This movie is pure schlock, and is better as fodder for one-liners than as representation of horror or science fiction.  I am unable to figure out who would want to buy this movie for their collection.  If you really have to have a W. Lee Wilder movie, try ""Phantom from Space.""  At least that movie had some charm.

1396510,4,B000056AW1,"The promo on the dvd reads "" HALF MAN! HALF MONSTER! "", I thought that was THE MANSTER's line! However, this manster resembles nothing more than some big guy in a furry costume who gets captured during a Himalayan expedition then taken back to LA where he escapes into the sewers. This is one of those no-budget fun to watch 1950's horror films that keeps you smiling from reel to reel. Certainly W. Lee Wilder's best film next to KILLERS FROM SPACE.
And as for the ""noir"" angle, in a couple scenes Paul Langton reminded me alot of William Holden in UNION STATION for some odd reason.
And when we get to LA and the police put out a dragnet ( they even bring a net! ) the movie takes on a decidedly noir look with it's night scenes and chase sequences. When the cops go down into the sewers I half expected them to encounter Richard Basehart from HE WALKED BY NIGHT rather than some goofy yeti monster!
So, maybe what we have here is another entry into the noir-horror genre alongside NIGHT OF THE DEMON, HANGOVER SQUARE, THE RED HOUSE and anything produced by Val Lewton. But then again, probably not.",1313539200,2,1101,4.428571428571429

1396512,2,B000056AW1,"It's 1954, a golden age in the monster movie genre, a time when foreign cultures existed only to be exploited and ridiculed, when botanists never left home without a syringe and an ample volume of heavy duty sedative, when the idea of capturing a monster on the other side of the world and transporting it back to the States still seemed like a good idea, and when you could put a fur hat with earmuffs on some bearded dude and cast him as a monster (heck, you could even put some scrawny guy in a bedraggled fur outfit and pass him off as the self-same monster, despite the fact that the two could not be more dissimilar in appearance).

Our story begins with Dr. Frank Parrish (Paul Langton) and photographer Peter Wells (Leslie Denison) rounding up a guide and a crew of Sherpas (whom they compare to pack mules), then heading up into the Himalayas in order for Parrish to study the area's plant life.  Things are going fine until Subra (Teru Shimada), the only English-speaking guide they could find, receives word that his wife has been kidnapped by a Yeti.  Naturally, Parrish laughs off such a preposterous story and insists that Subra stay and do his job.  A small mutiny later, the two dumb Americans find themselves with no choice but to accompany Subra in his search for the creature.  Once he's made to eat his condescending words, of course, Palmer - like all dedicated scientists - thinks about nothing but the fame and fortune that would surely come his way if he brought the Yeti back home with him.  After all, what could possibly go wrong?

The Snow Creature does provide the viewer with a few memorable moments.  Personally, I thought it was quite funny when a cop asked for a description of the snow creature, and you can't help but chuckle when the beast's immigration status is debated.  My favorite stupid moment, though, comes courtesy of the remarkable logic demonstrated by the L.A. inspector responsible for tracking down the escaped creature.  Once the Yeti is spotted in three different locations, he connects the dots on the map and insists that the exceedingly hairy fugitive has to be somewhere in the middle of that triangle.  This guy makes Inspector Clouseau look like Sherlock Holmes.

The only thing that makes The Snow Creature stand out from the crowd of other highly forgettable 1950's science fiction/monster movies is the fact that it was produced and directed by W. Lee Wilder, who just happens to be the brother of Billy Wilder.  Billy reportedly described his older brother as a boring son of a gun (well, something like that, anyway), and The Snow Creature makes it easy to see why.",1239926400,,2628,4.711790393013101

Snow Creature, however, is a pretty boring King Kong rip about a botanical expedition in the Himalayas that turns into a Yeti hunt when the wife of the American's guide is whisked off by one of them. A Yeti is captured after a cave in that kills his mate and cub, and gets shipped back to the good 'ol USA for exhibition. Amusingly, things get held up at customs by immigration when it can't be determined wether Yeti is man or beast. The creature escapes to the sewers of Los Angeles, occasionally popping out of a manhole to kill or terrify someone. Wouldn't you be agitated if your family was murdered and you were kidnapped, held in a refrigerator, and dumped in a strange city? Pity the Yeti, children, pity the Yeti.

The monster's victims are children in little suits that are supposed to look like adults in the creature's grasp.

But there is something about this movie that is attractive.  It is fun.  It is not a laugh out loud type of fun but 72 minutes pass quickly with a good (simple) story.  Somebody tried their hand at good camera work and it sort of pays off.  I would have to list it as one of my favorites of the 1950's ""B"" movies.  Remember B stands for Budget, not ""Bad.""

If you like, ""The Indestructible Man,"" ""She Demons,"" or ""From Hell It Came"" you will probably find the same type of goofy entertainment in Snow Creature.

1396519,1,B000056AW1,"When Billy Wilder hit it big in Hollywood his brother Willie, a handbag manufacturer, went out west, traded on the family name, and proceeded to make bags of a slightly different kind.  The most notorious of these is the 1954 SNOW CREATURE, a film that is occasionally said to rival THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS as the single worst sci-fi horror movie in the history of 20th Century cinema.

I'm not sure I'd go as far as that.  But one thing is sure: this snow creature is indeed abominable.  There is a plot of sorts.  A scientific expedition to Tibet, where women apparently wear head scarfs of a Scottish design, is forced to search for the yeti when the wife of one their guides goes missing.  This half of the movie entails lots of narration, lots of stock footage, and lots of walking.  When the beast is located, it is captured and returned to America, where it proceeds to terrorize cheap-looking women who ignore police reports to stay indoors.  This half of the movie consists of lots of bad dialogue and lots of walking through dark streets and sewers.

The monster costume here looks for all the world like some one rescued a throwaway from the silent film THE LOST WORLD.  The costume has dark fir and you see it a lot against black backgrounds: the actor suckered into wearing it takes a few steps toward the camera and then they run the film backwards so he takes a few steps away.  The cast is bad to the point of embarassment, there is no script to speak of, and as for the direction--well, the brothers Wilder didn't talk much and that pretty much says all you need to know.

It is true that unintentionally bad movies can be a lot of fun to watch, but frankly it seems to me that Willie Wilder's talent is such that he only aspires to the level of Ed Wood without ever actually reaching it.  Yes, it really is that bad.  I couldn't get a giggle out of it and I don't think you will either.  This snow creature is so abominable that's it is best left in the deep freeze.

7931721,2,B000056AW1,"""The Snow Creature"" (1954) is a black & white picture notable as the first film to address the topic of Bigfoot or, in this case, Yeti. The atmospheric beginning segues into a relatively dull story about a fake-looking Yeti brought to America from the Himilayas, which ends up languishing in customs while officials debate whether or not the creature is a passenger or cargo, i.e. animal or human. I'm not making this up. Then the creature gets loose in the city a la ""King Kong.""

""The Snow Creature"" is worthwhile only for historical reasons or as an interesting period piece and people smitten with the Sasquatch legend.

The film runs 71 minutes and was shot in Bronson Caves, Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California, USA

7931722,2,B000056AW1,"First image shown............a map, oh great, a geography lesson and a narration, what luck.  The movie begins in the Himalayas with a botanist (Paul Langton as Frank Parrish) looking for flowers in the snow.  Makes perfect sense to go posy picking in the snow.  To that end, he hires a team of Japanese speaking Sherpa.  In no time at all the guide and his crew mutiny when it's learned that the guide's wife has been carted off in the dead of night by a very particular yeti.  The expedition leader Parrish threatens to shoot the men for mutiny but they easily outnumber the idiot and set off to find the missing wife.  Instead, they capture a yeti who kills his mate and offspring in a cave-in.  They fly the oddity to Los Angeles and immediately run afoul of the immigration department...........is this thing a man or creature?  Of course it breaks free and goes on a brief killing spree.  Don't they always.

This movie starts out like a dull documentary then quickly descends into silliness and pomposity thanks to Paul Langton's boring performance as a snippy doctor and posy picker.  At worst, this movie is monotonous, at best a tedious trek of predictability.  The yeti in question is barely distinguishable in the dark but it looks to be a man covered in patches of fur, caught out in public wearing his jammies.  Nothing about it is alarming.

This is a bad movie on every level.",1430524800,,1392,4.628571428571429

7931724,2,B000056AW1,"This movie scared the beegeezes out if me when I was a little kid but to see it now, well it's pretty bad. Although I can see why it scared me. It's reall to bad because the premise of this movie is very good. If the same money had been spent on it that was spent on like say,The Creature From the Black Lagoon, it would have had possibilities! I'm sure a remake is out of the question. Modern movie bigfoot, sasquatchs, and yetis are portrayed more like giant werewolves with big fangs and long sharp claws. Nothing like what the ""real"" thing is supposed to be, a big man-ape creature. When you watch this you can see what could have been, and unfortunately what will probably never be ... a really GOOD The Snow Creature movie!",1418860800,2,729,4.328467153284672

THE SNOW CREATURE was directed by W. Lee 'Willie' Wilder, the older estranged brother of Billy Wilder. This odd story was written by Willie's son, Myles. L.A.'s Griffith Park Bronson caves and canyon stand in for rugged Tibetan wilderness.

It's the story of Himalaya climbers, a botanical expedition attempting to catalog life forms in the harsh climate of these tallest mountains on Earth. Instead of gathering permafrost lichens and the like, the group captures alive a Yeti, aka ""abominable snowman,"" this after their lead sherpa takes over by force upon hearing that his wife was kidnapped by one of these monsters. His intent to kill the tranquilized creature is thwarted when the expedition's original leaders wrest back control from him.

They instead ship the hairy naked beast, possibly played by incredibly tall (7' 7"") Lock Martin, in a refrigerated crate to Los Angeles. While a debate at Customs rages over whether a Yeti is animal or human, it escapes and after threading its way though a meat processing cooler, the snowman runs amuck in the muck of the sewers, that is until a cop blows it away with his service revolver.
