8588962,4,B00D3JL7TS,"This is a difficult topic but the movie is on point. Emotionally draining between anger, futility, this topic is reality. The acting is excellent. For a westerner it is educational to see the poverty and desperation of the source of these kids who can be easily radicalized (manipulated).",1464480000,,288,5.020833333333333
8588963,4,B00D3JL7TS,"Based on the real multiple bombings that took place on May 16, 2003 in Casablanca, Morocco, the film follows it's main characters over a period of 10 years, from boys to young men. Theres a lot thats powerful here, and there is much that has the ring of truth in this journey into darkness. But compared to (for example), Hany Abu-Assads more complex and richer Paradise Now theres also something a bit schematic. The reasons behind the transformation of these once sweet young men into bombers poverty, hopelessness, an overly macho culture  are certainly true, but they're also familiar. Theres a certain lack of feeling were taking the next step in digging deeper into their souls.

I also wish the villains of the piece, both Jihadist and civilian were a little less on-the-nose, a little less moustache twirling. In terms of those men recruiting the boys, I missed the charisma that I assume must be part of the recruitment process.

Much like Ayouchs earlier Ali Zoaua: Price of the Streets', also about middle -eastern street kids, while the film is intelligent and interesting, it feels like it should be more emotionally devastating than it ultimately is. That said, its good enough that I could imagine re-visiting it, and seeing if it pulls me in even deeper on a second viewing.",1444608000,,1290,4.8545454545454545

8588967,5,B00D3JL7TS,"I'm not much for writing film reviews, I'm more of a watcher and talker myself.  But I felt it was my duty to add this to balance off the other fellow's review.  I never found the movie dull; it is long, but it moved quickly for me.  I found the violent scene he mentions as being dreadful and superfluous to be a necessary step in the boys' development.  I thought this movie was excellent and I implore you to watch it.",1417564800,6,421,4.160493827160494
8588968,2,B00D3JL7TS,"I was very disappointed by this movie...especially since I had waited a long time for it to become available to people in the United States.  I'm fascinated by how people can get radicalized to the point where they are willing to strap explosives on themselves and blow them and innocent civilians up...all for the sake of their god.

That's what ""Horses of God"" is about...it's a fictionalized account of the bombings that killed 45 people in Casablanca, Morocco in 2003.  The movie follows several of the suicide bombers from their childhood to the point where they killed themselves and many innocent people.

I can give ""Horses of God"" a couple of points (hence the 2 star rating instead one star rating) because it shows how and why these young men were vulnerable to the predations of radical clerics preaching the glories of martyrdom (something most of them seem to preach for other people and not themselves and their sons).  ""Horses of God"" is also beautifully filmed with vivid colors.

But it's dreadfully dull.  Almost half of the movie deals with the suicide bombers in their childhoods, and I found myself reaching for the fast forward button on my remote control because that section drags so heavily.  There's also a deeply unpleasant scene where one child (probably about 13 years old) rapes an unconscious friend.  I have no idea as to why that was included.

I also think that the movie was mistaken in not showing the real carnage that these ""horses of God"" wrought in their country.  When they detonate their suicide vests, the screen just turns to white for a moment.  In my opinion, the film would have been a lot more powerful if it had shown the absolute horror that the bombers inflicted on innocent people who were also their countrymen.

Another missed opportunity of this film was failing to even briefly humanize the victims.  We just see them through the eyes of the brainwashed young men who were about to kill them.

Still another missed opportunity was not showing after the explosions the fact that many Moroccans were disgusted and appalled at the carnage that had been wrought in their country, and that far from being recognized as heroes, most people living there rejected their crimes.

So I'd recommend against watching this movie unless you have a serious interest in Morocco.  Instead, you should watch a movie that is far, far better that also deals with a group of young men who become suicide bombers.  It's called ""Four Lions"" and it utterly puts ""Horses of God"" to shame.
