576554,5,6303118259,I like this sequel. It lives up to the previous film. The performers are all excellent in their roles. The action is well done and well paced. Robert Davi makes a really good bad guy. I was not impressed with Benicio. The opening sequence is well done. Gladys Knight did a great job with the title song. She should have done more.,1505001600,,330,4.338709677419355

576560,4,6303118259,"Licence to Kill (1989) is Timothy Dalton's second run as 007, and while it's a respectable film, it lacks the charm of most of the films preceding it. It seems like when Dalton tries to be a little humorous, we shake our heads and want him to be the very thing we didn't want him to be in the first place: serious. Weird analogy, yes, but this is how it feels at times. Dalton is a decent Bond (decent is actually the weakest Bond, so I think we're doing well), but nothing memorable. As for the plot, it's a very simple one, with some decent action and a little suspense. The best part of this film? The women, and how magnetic they are. I certainly can't complain about any of the women's performances in this film. This film is rather typical for an action film, so don't expect anything great, nor expect anything subpar. Overall, it's a respectable film. The special features are okay, and the picture and sound quality are first rate.",1485388800,,940,4.4393063583815024

576651,2,6303118259,"This Bond movie is one of the low points in the franchise.  Do yourself a favor and skip it.

Much has been said about how the Bond in this film is written to be closer in spirit to Ian Fleming's original concept of the character -- tougher, grittier, more violent, etc.  And while that may be true, it alone cannot make up for the film's weaknesses.  It is revealed in one of the documentary features that comes with this Blu-ray that the Writers Guild of America went on strike before LTK's script could be finished, and that producer Michael G. Wilson essentially completed the screenplay himself.  It shows.  The dialogue is rather pedestrian and amateurish, and both the characters and the action setpieces lack subtlety, wit, and and nuance.  It's a very by-the-numbers film that lacks any true excitement, and it isn't very engaging at all.

Timothy Dalton is a very fine actor, but he shines better on stage than on film.  His theatrical training is apparent here, but on film it makes his acting look very broad and even cartoonish.  But in fairness, he isn't given much of substance to work with here, and I don't think director John Glen knows how to pull good performances from actors.

And at least in MY mind, James Bond is supposed to exude confidence and be cool under pressure.  Dalton's bond registers a few too many looks of panic and anxiety under only somewhat-trying (for James Bond) circumstances.  Hard to believe a ""tougher, grittier"" Bond could be so excitable.  Either Dalton was over-emoting (from his theater training where you try to ""reach the back row"") or he simply was inconsistent in his portrayal of the character.  Or both.

And the B-list of co-stars doesn't exactly help things much.  A Bond film needs an interesting villain, and Robert Davi (who has done good work elsewhere but is given very little to work with here) just doesn't know how to make his character interesting to watch or hear. And there are plenty of other B-list character actors in this film too, all of whom bring that ""direct-to-video"" clout.  Anthony Zerbe?  Don Stroud?  Priscilla Barnes? Anthony Starke? Frank McRae?  Wayne Newton?  Grand L. Bush (whom I've met and is a nice guy)?  Former Playboy Playmate Diana Lee Hsu?  How did the casting director for this film not get laughed out of the room?

There are some interesting action setpieces in this film, including some water-to-air sequences that are fun to watch.  But those are supposed to be par for the course in a James Bond film.  And there are some absurdly lame action setpieces in the film too, notably a dockside bar fight and a rather preposterous shootout at a ramshackle hut in which ninjas just appear out of nowhere for no reason other than to have ninjas appear out of nowhere.

This film seems to have rather low production value, too.  Perhaps the budget was too low for the production's needs. It is explained in the bonus features that the film was shot primarily in Mexico for budgetary reasons.  And they managed to find some of the least-interesting locations in Mexico, too.  The whole thing looks like a TV movie.

And the miscellaneous supporting cast?  A misfire in almost every way possible.  The various henchmen look like they were picked out at random from a phone book.  Very few of them have the features or physicality we associate with movie villains.  It's hard to take them seriously or find them even the least bit imposing.  Again, very very poor casting choices.

While the concept may have looked good on paper (""James Bond goes rogue and hunts the killer of an old friend""), the filmmakers failed miserably in its execution.  For the most part the movie is unimpressive and just plain dull.  And there's no sense of fun.  It makes for a rather boring entry in the Bond franchise.

I purchased the Blu-ray at an attractive price in 2015 but in the end it wasn't much of a deal at all, even if the disc did come with a respectable number of bonus features.  It was a disappointing and boring film when I saw it in the theaters in 1989, and now 26 years later it is just as disappointing and boring.  Perhaps more so.

This is an underwhelming film that didn't improve with age.",1446076800,,4185,4.6726027397260275

576738,5,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton is a terrific actor.  Not to mention the only actor with Shakespearean theatre experience to play James Bond.  He had big shoes to fill in following Sean Connery.  I like Roger Moore, but Dalton makes the role his very own.  I enjoy his portrayal of Bond--quietly angry, coldly ruthless with a personal vendetta to settle and full of seething intensity.  It's not business, but personal here.  His friend Felix in CIA has been killed and Bond is hell bent on revenge.  And those green eyes!  In my opinion, Dalton looks the most like James Bond should appear, the product of a Swiss mother and English father.  Of course, he has some beautifully and very talented ladies to tangle with including a young Talisa Soto who looks 18.  Cari Lowell is perfect as a sexy tough bounty hunter.  And Robert Davi is always a superb villain.  He's a great actor and has got that look of someone that you never wish to piss off.  A young Benicio del Toro is dead-on with his portrayal of psychopathic right hand man who loves his job.",1429660800,,1036,4.565217391304348

576950,4,6303118259,"This John Glen directed Bond (his 5th in a row) was his final one and was also the second and last film starring under-appreciated Timothy Dalton.  I believe it was also a creative turning point for the franchise.  It began with Dalton's previous Bond film ""The Living Daylights.""  His Bond ditched the comedic talents of Roger Moore, especially in his later work, and focused on the meaner, vengeful side of Bond.  In fact, this Bond film is pure vengeance.

James is attending the wedding of his CIA buddy Felix Leiter (David Hedison), when they are distracted by the DEA moving in on a kingpin drug smuggler (Robert Davi).  Leiter had previous dealings with Sanchez (Davi) and joins the chase.  Sanchez excapes.  A short time later he exacts revenge on Leiter by having his new bride killed and offering Leiter as shark bait.  Watch for Benicio Del Toro in only his second film appearance as one of Sanchez's henchmen.  This scene alone probably got the MPAA to raise the rating on the film to PG-13, a first for a Bond film.

Leiter survives but is missing a leg and part of an arm as a result.  Bond promises to track down Sanchez who has retreated to his castle in Isthmus (Panama).  Bond is ordered by M to return to another assignment.  He refuses and resigns.  He must now exact revenge on his own against a powerful criminal with a personal army at his disposal.  He does get some help from one of Leiter's confidants; beautiful, leggy Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell).

As you would expect, we are treated to some excellent stunts.  Some are under and on the water, some in the air and I especially liked the finale involving semi-trucks loaded with drugs lumbering down a mountain road.  This film is darker and more menacing than many of the earlier Bond films.  I thought Dalton, while perhaps a bit too dour at times, gives this movie the proper tone.  My only complaint is the brief appearance of Wayne Newton as a behind-the-scenes ""religious"" ally of Sanchez, who tries to get frisky with Pam.  Talisa Soto is additional Latina eye candy playing Sanchez's girlfriend.  Of course she is no match for Bond's charms.  This is the best James Bond movies since ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977) up to that point.

The Blu ray package is also pretty special.  The transfer comes with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and video resolution of 1080p.  It looks great and is one of the better presentations from the Bond collection.  This transfer has exceptional detail and clarity, eschewing some of the softness in previous efforts.  Black levels are excellent.  The night scenes are clear.  Colors pop with the green valleys, blue ocean and brown mountains.  And did I mention Ms. Lowell's legs?  The audio is also very good.  It comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Most of the action is going to come from the front 3 channels however.  Surround and sub use is minimal except during the musical score.  Speaking of music.  I would be remiss in not mentioning a couple under-appreciated (like Dalton) songs.  The title song is sung by Motown great Gladys Knight and the over-the-end-credits song is ""If You Asked Me"" by R & B diva Patti LaBelle.  Both are great.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, Korean, 2 Mandarin dialects and English SDH.  Here are the extras:

576951,1,6303118259,"This was reportedly the only R-rated James Bond movie to date...and it is easy to see why.  The story begins with Bond's close friend about to be married, only for a villainous South American drug lord to end up attacking him and his bride, having the friend maimed and the bride raped and killed.  And this is only the beginning of the violence and cruelty that runs through the rest of the movie.

The story has Bond completely abandon his government and his post to go on a wildcat mission after the drug lord.  Bond does not act like Bond, but like Rambo-which is not the idea of the James Bond character in the first place.  But the worst part of all is the ending-what happens to Bond after he has broken all the rules and deserted his post?  You can only guess.

577067,5,6303118259,"Licence To Kill is incredibly overlooked by fans, a small amount of people enjoy it though and I'm one of them. Coming out back in 1989, it was shocking to see a more violent 007 film (the first to get a PG-13 rating). The Living Daylights started to bring back a darker edge with Timothy Dalton taking over for Roger Moore. It was a back-to-basics approach and it was something we hadn't seen since From Russia With Love. LTK goes a bit further in the new direction we saw on TLD and I highly enjoy both but I personally think LTK surpasses TLD.

Bond goes after drug lord Sanchez (Robert Davi) after his friend Felix Leighter (David Hedison) is attacked by Sanchez. Bond finds his wife dead and Felix mutilated, he plots revenge against Sanchez instead of following what he's assigned by the Secret Service. Bond loses his license to kill but still goes after Sanchez and gets revenge in the end.
Sometimes overlooked for being too violent but most of all, it's realistic and has a believable plot. Carey Lowell (Law And Order) plays an underrated Bond girl who winds up saving Bond in the end. David Hedison (The Fly, Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea) played the best Felix, in my opinion and was first one to play him more than once (also in Live And Let Die). LTK is a worthy addition to the Bond franchise and I'd recommend watching it if you haven't yet. Still don't get why LTK gets such a bad rap by fans since it's one of the closest adaptions to Ian Fleming's Bond, right next to ""From Russia With Love"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".",1402099200,2,1552,4.445614035087719

577070,4,6303118259,"Timothy Daltons second and final James Bond film, 1989s Licence to Kill was the franchises sixteenth (and first R-rated) installment.  Yes, Licence pushes the franchises newfound sense of gritty realism to a violent extreme with shocking sequences depicting a guy having his heart ripped out and another later being burned alive.  Hardly common for non-schlock movies at that time, so it is hard to believe that five-time Bond director John Glen also earlier helmed the comparatively light-hearted, sluggish Octopussy (1983) and View to a Kill (1985) in this series.  Even so, Daltons efforts portraying Bonds very personal vendetta vs. a Central American drug lord prevail courtesy of an excellent cast; a smartly written script; and top-notch production values.  Make no mistake: this James Bond film will appeal far more to those would prefer Daniel Craigs contemporary hardcore style, as seen in Casino Royale: (2006).

Rating: 4/5 stars.  Licence was made at least fifteen years before its time  today, it probably would be a huge box office hit.",1400198400,2,1051,5.25748502994012
577071,5,6303118259,"In my opinion, Timothy Dalton is sorely underrated as James Bond. Behind Connery, Dalton is probably the best we've gotten. He could be serious, but still knew how to keep the movies fun, something Daniel Craig isn't the best at. And while The Living Daylights remains my favorite James Bond film, Licence to Kill is probably the best film in the series. Is it the best ""Bond"" movie? No, but it's still the most entertaining film in the series. Less of a Bond movie, Licence to Kill plays out more like an 1980's action flick along the lines of ""Lethal Weapon."" The movie is all about Bond getting revenge on a drug lord who attacked his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter, and murdered Leiter's bride. The film has many entertaining sequences, including one in which a man is pushed into a decompression chamber and is exploded because the film's villain branded him a traitor. Another great scene finds a young Benicio Del Toro falling into a cocaine grinder. The villain is interesting (He is played by Robert Davi of ""Die Hard"") and Q is given a much bigger role in the film. The movie was not as well received in 1989 because of the series's sudden turn into darkness; it's poor box office take could be attributed to the fact that the summer of 1989 was packed with huge moneymakers (Indiana Jones 3, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman, Back to the Future II). However, the film does not deserve the criticism it receives. Sure, the film's Bond girls are pretty bland, but this is made up by the movie's action (the climax features a race-of sorts with semis), acting (Dalton and Davi are great) and score (Michael Kamen of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" replaces John Barry for, unfortunately, one movie).

577167,3,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton's second and last shot at playing James Bond isn't nearly as much fun as his debut, 2 years earlier, in the Summer of 1987 film THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS . This time Bond gets mad after a close friend (David Hedison) from the intelligence sector is assassinated on his wedding day, and 007 goes undercover to link the murder to an international drug cartel.

Robert Davi makes an interesting adversary, but as with most of the Bond films in the '70s, '80s, and '90s--and especially since the end of the cold war--one has to wonder why we should still care about these lesser villains and their unimaginative crimes. Still, Dalton did manage in his short time with the character to make 007 his own, which neither Roger Moore did nor Pierce Brosnan did.

James Bond is catapulted into his most passionate adventure -- not for country, not for justice, but for personal revenge. As Agent 007 turns renegade, Timothy Dalton brings urgency, charm, and deadly determination to his portrayal of the screen's greats.

This Bond flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 16 going on 17 years old in my Junior year in high school when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1989.",1390262400,2,1194,4.6761904761904765

577172,5,6303118259,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country. Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films. These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role. Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here. Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key. DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond. But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.
THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct. After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be.
The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target. What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. But going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged. Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character. With 2006's CASINO ROYALE, a level of realism was added to the series that had never been seen up to then. And so we reflect back on what Sean Connery had established and that is strictly an observation and a retrospective contemplation on my part.
Is ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE the definitive Bond film? Perhaps. Take a look at LIVE AND LET DIE and compare the two. Interesting. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has become a cult classic over the years. It contains many of the most basic elements that are an integral part of the early James Bond films. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is one of those rare films where all the talents come together at their peek of perfection delivering an impeccable film. The magic of MOONRAKER is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series. There is something in MOONRAKER for everyone. Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed. After Bonds have come and gone through the years A VIEW TO A KILL somehow still entertains more with each passing year and for me it sort of rounded out the classic years of the Bond films that started with DR. NO. It ended one era on I suppose a happy carefree note.
The first thing that struck me about this film is that Timothy Dalton could act and he took the part very seriously. I found THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to be one of the better James Bond films. LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting and progressive follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of a world weary James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.
GOLDENEYE, Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film, is an interesting one. Most noticeable was its score. Eric Serra's score to GOLDENEYE is highly innovative. It is powerful, sensitive and enigmatic. It is a dark score centered on James Bond the man and explores his psyche, his sense for survival and his motivations for getting the job done. Eric Serra's compositions are unlike anything heard in the previous James Bond films of the series. The score still remains highly controversial. James Bond had come up against the Soviets numerous times in the past. In 1995 Soviet Russia was gone. GOLDENEYE was the film that bridged a gap in more ways than one. Infrequently in an action film series does one of its entries attempt to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its plot as is the case with THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. The director of this film tried to show how James Bond develops an obsession for a woman for whom he has become intrigued with, her having been mistreated by British Intelligence, and the effect it has on him. Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored. They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr. Christmas Jones. Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film. He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series. DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of the most implausible Bonds, yet it remains entertaining and has some real classic Bond moments. It contains one of David Arnold's best scores. DIE ANOTHER DAY is not all that bad in retrospect. The first hour is classic Bond and it is very good and well written. There is a definite feeling and physical confrontation between Bond and the main villain that has been lacking in many of the Bond films. This film also entertains unlike several before it. It was the 40th Anniversary Bond film when it was released and it contains many references to classic Bond moments that preceded it. DIE ANOTHER DAY can't be all that bad.",1381795200,,11204,4.781733746130031

577174,3,6303118259,"Released in 1989, ""Licence to Kill"" always struck me as the most atypical Bond film. In this one James (Timothy Dalton) goes rogue after a good friend's bride is murdered and the friend is half-eaten by a shark. Stripped of his authority, Bond vengefully goes after the responsible drug lord, Sanchez (Robert Davi).

The opening act drives home that ""Licence to Kill"" is a more serious and brutal Bond flick. Although there's still a lot of ""yeah, right"" cartooniness, the comedic edge of past Bond films is all but gone. And the violence is so savage and merciless compared to past films that it actually comes off shocking.

In addition, the spectacular globe-trotting locations are absent in favor of a more one-dimensional setting -- the Florida Keys and Mexico (where the film was shot). Although they do fine with these limited locales, the change is glaring.

The women are below par as well. Carey Lowell works best as the Bond babe, but she pales in comparison to, say, Lois Chiles, Luciana Paluzzi and Claudine Auger. Talisa Soto is also on hand as Sanchez' girl and, briefly, Priscilla Barnes.

The opening stunt sequence is second rate as well compared to past Bond films, like ""The Living Daylights"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"".

Furthermore, there's an under-developed subplot about a cult guru and the film seems overlong at 133 minutes.

But the movie scores points with effective villains (it wouldn't be right to say ""good villains"", would it?), particularly Davi and a young Benicio Del Toro, both cruel and sadistic.

FINAL SAY: The fun might be over, but at least they tried something different to stir things up. Unfortunately, it didn't work. ""Licence to Kill"" performed weakly at the box office and is easily the worst Bond flick up through Pierce Brosnan's run that ended in 2003. It seems less like a Bond film than any other in the franchise up to 2003. Still, it's interesting as an atypical part of the series -- darker and grittier, albeit still comic booky. Plus Dalton's striking as the vengeful protagonist and, if you can hang around for the final act, it's pretty exciting.

For me though, the story is a bit too dark for Bond, then again I'm someone who loves Roger Moore's interpretation of Bond the best, who is known as the more slapstick/humorous/playboy version of Bond.

Indeed, all the other Bonds did James better!  Timothy Dalton simply lacked the elegance, attractiveness, sex-appeal, and 007 brand of charisma we expect.

I wish Dalton would have stayed on as Bond because he made a good one.  Much better than Pierce Brosnan, in my humble opinon. This movie is hard-edged, gritty and quite a bit more violent than the standard Roger Moore-era Bond fare.  So far, this is the only Bond movie in the series to be rated PG-13.  A word of caution; young children might find some of the scenes disturbing, so they shouldn't watch them; particularly the scene where Sanchez puts Anthony Zerbe in the decompression chamber and his head explodes.  A few extra seconds has been added to that scene in this Blu-Ray release, and it is VERY realistic.

All of that aside, the Blu-ray version of this film is, quite frankly, excellent.  It is about as good as I've seen for a film shot in the late 1980's.  The HD treatment brings out all the sharpness and detail, and pay particular attention to the low-light scenes, such as where the harbor pilot boat pulls into the dock......absolutely amazing the detail you see.  On the DVD release, this was all mush. The video quality, color balance and sharpness are all excellent. Without doubt, the biggest problem with the original DVD release was the poor quality of the audio. Glady's Knight's fabulous opening sequense sounded like a monural record player!  That problem has been rectified in the Blu-ray release.  The title sequence music is crisp, focused and in full 7-channel dolby surround, as it should be.  The soundtrack throughout the film is substantially upgraded, with the vocal track being very easy to understand and the music, explosions, etc. spectacular.

This Blu-ray is a MUST for any serious James Bond enthusiast, and buying this one over the DVD is an easy decision.....BUY the Blu-Ray.  You will be happy that you did.",1371254400,3,1935,4.751497005988024

With ""Licence to Kill"", I know it has it's cheesy moments, but this film feels much more like an Ian Fleming flavored James Bond then any of the other entries directed by Guy Hamilton, Lewis Gilbert, or this film's director John Glenn.  Bond is at his gritty best in this story, and he has a great personal motivation for his revenge.  The action is realistic, and most of the bad guys don't feel like they are out of a comic book.  They have some real nasty objectives with the drug trade plot, and I love how Franz Sanchez comes completely unglued by Bond's psychological manipulations.  The story moves at a decent pace, and I really enjoyed the Milton Crest character and his roll in the overall drug operation. His fate was amusing, and I almost could find myself  feeling sorry for him. How Bond set him up, was brilliant story telling.  The call back to earlier Bond gags (like the duck disguise from ""Goldfinger"") was pulled off very well this time around. The Manta Ray disguise was so much more realistic here, than the use of a crocodile disguise done in ""Octopussy"". The Truck chase was a bit over the top, but it beats Bond fighting in front of a rear projection screen, or fighting on a airplane yet again. Yes, I like this film a lot.

577365,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton takes on the role of James Bond for his second and final time. Which is a bit upsetting really because Timothy Dalton seems to be just getting settled into the role. If given more films to further mold his version of the character I believe he would have created a Bond similar to the one Daniel Craig portrays in the most recent 007 films.

 License to Kill has James Bond go rogue after his friend is brutally tortured by  Franz Sanchez: a powerful drug lord. We see a darker, more vengeful side to Bond that was never seen in the films that came before it. Along for the ride is Pam Bouvier who in my opinion is one of the best Bond girls in the series. She isn't an annoying damsel in distress but a former Army pilot who can take care of herself. She saves Bonds life more times than he saves hers. Q is also there to supply gadgets for Bond. Unlike his roles in other Bond films where he just appears for one scene to give 007 his gadgets, Q actually takes part in Bonds mission. It was fun to watch Q be part of the action.
 Speaking of action, the film ends with an amazing chase sequence involving large tanker trucks. You will no doubt have to suspend you disbelief as many of the stunts performed during the chase are very highly improbable, even for a James Bond film, but they are just way too cool to not enjoy.

 However, the film does have some draw backs. For starters, Franz Sanchez isn't really a memorable Bond villain. I don't even think hes that big of a threat. Compared to other Bond villains who tried launching nukes and taking over the world, drug trafficking doesnt seem all that bad. Also, theres a bit of confusion about why Sanchez doesnt recognize James Bond. At the beginning of the movie, Bond helps chase him down. You think Sanchez would have caught at least a glimpse of Bonds face. But this is really a minor complaint and its really just for the sake of letting 007 pretend to be a hit man to get close to Sanchez.

 Overall, I think that this is one of the better Bond films. Dalton plays a great vengeful Bond, he has a great Bond girl to help him, Q has more of a role, and the ending chase sequence is worth enough alone to see the film.",1363305600,,2195,4.272289156626506

I was trying to complete a set of the 2009 releases for a friend for the holidays, and having the new 2012 one when they advertised it as the 2009 one is frustrating.  Worse, I contacted Amazon customer support twice via email and have still not received even an automated response.  I understand its the holiday shopping season and they are probably inundated, so I just went ahead and returned it when I received no response for the second time.

Disappointed that Amazon is not doing a better job curating their product descriptions and ensuring people are getting what they purchase.

577506,5,6303118259,"LICENCE TO KILL gives us a world-weary gritty James Bond. LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting and progressive follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of a world weary James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.

Dalton's Bond certainly possesses the drive that Connery gives Bond and adds more realism and conviction in his no-nonsense performance. Dalton posses the intensity and a certain presence that Connery often played with his tongue in cheek, but Dalton adds an enigmatic quality of the lonely world-weary blunt instrument to Bond. At times one can detect a melancholic aura tinged with disgust for his line of work. These were qualities that Dalton openly wanted to put into his performance. This film integrates the thinking man's hero and the man of action into Dalton's Bond.

James Bond resigns in this film, putting his current assignment aside, and sets out on a relentless crusade of revenge for the mutilation of his friend, Felix Leiter, and the death of Leiter's wife. Why should Bond loose his objectivity and his professionalism over this incident? There is duty and there is loyalty and honor. Sometimes these virtues become in conflict.

Dalton's Bond has little time for levity or diversion from his personal mission at hand. Yet, he is the dedicated civil servant to some higher order in a world gone cynical and unsympathetic. Once Bond breaks into Milton Krest's warehouse in Key West and proceeds to get pulled in by M at the Hemmingway House, the film focuses on the vengeful Bond. We see Sharkey's body being towed to Krest's boat, another victim of Sanchez, and Bond in a restrained fit of controlled rage takes care of business immediately in one of the better scenes from the series. Eventually, Bond catches up with and confronts Sanchez face to face in many scenes that are full tension and suspense. Ultimately, they have a very brutal no-holds-bared showdown.

LICENCE TO KILL contains good performances. One of the best is that of Benicio Del Toro's as Dario, a Sanchez henchman. Dario's screen presence is twisted and contorted bringing the notion that evil menace is the only reason for his existence in life. Don Stroud was very credible and somewhat likeable as Heller, the head of security and Sanchez's private army. Wayne Newton actually brought a nice touch of comic relief as Professor Joe Butcher, head of a meditation temple and front for Sanchez's laboratories. Anthony Zerbe brought his unique brand of histrionics to his role of the seemingly drunken smuggler Milton Krest. From a sentimental point of view, it was good to see David Hedison reprise his role as Felix Leiter and it was nice to see Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the field in a meatier role than usual. Robert Brown gave his most credible performance as M in this film. Brown never possessed the charisma that Bernard Lee brought to the role, but Brown as M brings a cold detachment in his scene with Bond even deploying sharpshooters in the event that the rogue agent may attempt to act irrationally when his ""Licence to Kill"" is revoked.",1350345600,,3039,4.906614785992218

577509,5,6303118259,"Licence To Kill is a great Bond movie, one of the best in my opinion. It is Timothy Dalton's second and last performance as 007. It is also the first Bond film not to use the title of one of Ian Fleming's novels or short stories as its own. The plot is darker than most previous Bond films and Dalton's Bond is much more vengeful, which puts him more in line with Fleming's character.

  Trying not to give everything away, the plot basically follows Bond as he tries to avenge his good friend Felix Leiter and his wife. While on their honeymoon, they are brutally attacked by an escaped drug lord, resulting in Mrs. Leiter's death and in Felix losing his leg. Felix, by the way, is a reoccurring CIA operative in the Bondverse and has been portrayed by eight different actors in the Bond movies over the years. At any rate, Bond goes all out to get revenge for his friends and goes very dark, foreboding the performances of Daniel Craig years later, in my opinion.

  In addition to having a memorable Bond performance, this film also includes a much expanded role and laudable performance as Q by Desmond Llewelyn. This was perhaps his finest performance in this role and really stands out. Better yet, while Q provides 007 with some useful and interesting devices, the sci-fi aspect of this movie is not in overdrive and feels like a snug and complimenting fit.

  The Bond girls are actually spot-on for this movie as well and so is the main villain, drug lord Franz Sanchez.

  Whereas the drug lord Kananga in Live & Let Die was very hokey and unbelievable, actor Robert Davi's Sanchez is very convincing. He is surrounded by henchman that actually feel threatening, he seems to understand cause and effect, he tries to take an active role in dealing with his problems, and he has a realistic hideout in the form of a bank he owns and finances with his drug sales earnings.

  Similarly, the Bond girls are very good. Talisa Soto's Lupe, Sanchez's girlfriend who falls head over heels for Bond, is expert as an abused and underappreciated girlfriend who, seeing a way out, runs for the exit. Cary Lowell's CIA-operative Pam is very good too. She is a modern woman with her own skills and agenda, who uses her charms on the men around her and her fighting skills to good success when needed.

  All around, this movie is truly a classic. The movie is one of the rare occasions in the Bond series where everything seems to fall into place to make a very good picture. The Blu-ray release is, as all of them so far have been, very good. I give Licence To Kill five stars and recommend it to everyone.",1343606400,4,2603,4.5256410256410255
577510,4,6303118259,"Enjoyed License to Kill.  I was very disappointed in Dalton's first Bond movie ""The Living Daylights.""  I was much more impressed with this Bond, the plot was somewhat different as James Bond goes ""AWOL.""",1343433600,,204,4.970588235294118
577511,5,6303118259,"""Licence to Kill"" is really a GREAT action film in the BOND Series. Sadly, TIMOTHY DALTON only made two of them. I would place him at the top of the list were it not for the groundbreaking Sean Connery. But if you pay close attention, Timothy gives several dimensions to the character and I feel it more closely resembles Ian Fleming's BOND in his novels.

Old BOND friend ""Felix Lieter"" played by David Heddison (of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" fame) reprises his role here.

Yes, the spelling of ""LICENCE"" is different than the U.S. (License), but it does give it a BRITISH flavor. Afterall, BOND does work for British Intelligence (MI6)-  HELLO!!!

I would rate the ""BONDS"":

1. Sean Connery
2. Timothy Dalton
3. Pierce Brosnan (actually a TIE for second)
4. Daniel Craig
5. George Lazenby (On Her Majesty's Secret Service)
6. David Niven and Peter Sellers (orig. Casino Royale)

It may not be a CLASSIC to other BOND Fans, but it rates pretty darn high in my book. As BOND goes rouge, it was a nice change of pace to see him out of his element; as well as ""Q"" getting more screen time this time around. Desmond Llewelyn reprises his role as well. Sadly. Desmond passed away about ten years after this film.

Talisa Soto as ""Lupe"" could have injected more into her role, as the acting is something less than good. But on the other hand, Carey Lowell as ""Pam Bouvier"", does a decent job. The bad guys include Anthony Zerbe (a made for tv/movie villain) playing an excellent role as ""Milton Krest"" (he gets framed by BOND and is killed rather gruesomely). --- POOOF!!! --- Robert Davi as the main bad guy ""Franz Sanchez, is also as good. But the main supporting role goes to the.......IGUANA!

Memorable gadget, the ""signature camera weapon"". Exciting finish with the oil tanker semis! Good directing job by veteran John Glen.

ENJOY the film, give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. Unless you are not a true BOND fan and just rate films solely on the actors involved. There's gotta be more than that....",1343260800,,2019,4.6016713091922
577512,5,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton was a much better BOND than Pierce Brosnan. Too bad that he only made two BOND movies. This is a most interesting ""BOND"" film in that it deals with a real life villian who is a drug czar and Bond's vendetta against him for maiming his friend Felix Leiter and killing Felix's wife. Bond is human in this film in that he shows sadness at what happened to Felix and his new bride and his desire for justice against the person who did these terrible things to Felix. Bond is no super human being in this film for he is bloodied in the film's climax but good triumphs over evil in the end thanks to Bond's quick thinking.

577513,5,6303118259,"There is no doubt,  the classic James Bond series are the best.

Licence  to Kill  is the hight point of the series.  Connery films laid the foundation,  Lazenby and Moore  films moved it along,  and Dalton's clearly showed us how it would have looked like once the  "" ever tightening coil has  finally sprung"".  That is, when he eventually got fed up with his job and went  alone to fight a personal war.

What is Dalton-Bond style?  I say, it is Connery elegance with less flirting, and with much more expressive  eyes.  He can order you around with a look.  Controlled anger.  And always that threat of violence if he gets pushed too far.  Like a volcano,  composed but everybody knows its capacity for destruction.

Dalton was a successful James Bond.  His portrayal was supposedly the closest to the actual novels.

577643,5,6303118259,"If there's one cultural constant that different generations growing up over the past 50 years can share, it's the omnipresence of the James Bond franchise.  Britain's most famous fictional spy has been caddishly charming women, fighting thugs, engaging in high speed chases, and infiltrating supervillain lairs on the big screen since 1962's Dr. No.  With the arrival of a Blu Ray collection of all the EON-produced Bond Movies imminent as of 2012, I figured it would be a good time to visit this DVD collection, which encompasses the 20 ""Mark I"" James Bond movies, as I call them.  The ""Mark I"" series includes all the EON produced movies, starting with Dr. No, and ending with Die Another Day, and can be said to share a roughly consistent timeline of sorts (however, given that the movies came out over a 40 year timespan, you still need some suspension of disbelief regarding Bond's age never really changing over time).  As a result, this collection does not include the newer, ""Mark II"" films with Daniel Craig, where the series was definitively rebooted with Casino Royale depicting Bond's first mission as a ""double O"" agent, nor does it include the underrated Never Say Never Again, which was a reworking of Thunderball (released in competition with the ""official series""), with Bond portrayed by Sean Connery as an aging spy.

The collection is comprised of 4 sets of 5 movies each, with each film having both the film disc with commentary, and an extras disc.  The extras are your usual assortment of trailers, behind the scenes footage, TV specials, and whatnot.  The picture quality is pretty good for standard definition, and with upscaling allowing for a screen-filling picture, it makes me a tad uncertain whether it would be worth the money to invest in the upcoming Blu Ray set.  The movies also come with little booklets for each movie, that discuss the backdrop and context of each movie's release, as well as casting details.  While it is regrettable that each 5 movie set does not contain the movies in chronological order, I can tell that this was done so that the individual set releases would have maximum sales, as many fans have a particular favorite ""period"".

With 5 actors all playing the role of James Bond over the course of 40 years, there is bound to be high and low points for each viewer.  I have a particular soft spot for the films with a tinge of sci-fi influence and global stakes: Dr. No, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, The Man With the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and Die Another Day (it seems EON rather likes spacecraft and satellite weaponry).  At the same time, many of the movies with a more ""grounded"" approach, such as From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (George Lazenby's sole Bond turn) are also great entries. It should be noted that, for those who are fans of Daniel Craig's entries due to their somewhat hard-hitting, physical nature, the first few Sean Connery movies bear revisiting in particular.  The final act of Dr. No portrays Bond not as a superhuman agent with a cool quip always at hand, but rather as a battered man, in grave danger as he crawls through a series of boiling hot air ducts in a radiated secret base.  None of the actors who play Bond do a poor job, and even poor, oft-overlooked Timothy Dalton makes a respectable turn as a grimmer, more serious James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"" and ""License To Kill"".

That's not to say there aren't weak spots in the franchise.  The World Is Not Enough was particularly unmemorable, while Octopussy didn't provide any of the excitement of its non-EON 007 competition, Never Say Never Again.  Similarly, For Your Eyes Only failed to make any impression, other than the poor decision to imply a cheap-shot death for Bond's archenemy Blofeld at the start of the film (it is never expressly stated that Blofeld is the character in that scene, but there is enough obvious similarity to draw your own conclusions...or at least assume it is a Blofeld double/wannabe).  And even the entertaining Die Another Day had a plotline that required a massive leap of faith to buy into, as by even James Bond standards, the speed at which the villain's plan was executed over the timeline of events seemed improbable at best.  But, in the big picture, this collection is essential viewing for those of us who enjoy our action with more than a little style, and our villains more than a little over the top.  Is the ""Mark I"" Bond a bit dated in his attitudes, especially towards women?  Perhaps, but that's what makes him only human, despite his almost inhuman prowess.  Bond's decision to let down his emotional guard in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", and the tragic ending of that movie, provides a good explanation of why he changed into an ultra-slick, one-liner spouting, bed-hopping, devil may care agent- never again would he allow himself the luxury of too much attachment to people, lest he suffer that kind of loss again.  Accept the limitations of the character for what they are, and you'll enjoy this set of movies.",1341532800,,5098,4.781321184510251
577644,5,6303118259,"This was one of the best bond films of the 80s along side the living daylights. Timothy Dalton was a very good james bond. People can say what they want but much like connery was the bond of the 60s, moore for the 70s and brosnan for the 90s, dalton was the james bond of the 80s. I think the films strong points were of course dalton as bond, robert davi and benecio del toro as the bad guys as well as a solid 80s druglord storyline. Even though some might say that the stunts or action scenes weren't good I think it contains one of the best finales in a bond film with the tanker chase and also the dispatching of the villian  The main weak points of the film were the two girls were fairly average and the music score which could have been a bit more exicting. Otherwise the villians were considerably evil and bond was just as brutal in a good guy way. definitely a film you could watch more than once unlike octapussy or moonraker which has to be turned off thirty minutes into the movie. I think dalton should have played bond more than twice but not goldeneye (he was too old than) he should have done moores last two movies in which moore was 100 years old.

A few points to ponder though, those of you who didn't like this movie must not have like the sean connery movies. Because the violence in the early bond movies was gratuitous, a bit cartoonish. But still, I guess they didn't like the bond books either, because Dalton's Bond is spot on from the books, and just like Connery's bond, Alittle tougher though. I rank this movie exceptionally high on my Favorite Bond movie list, simply for the fact that Bond acts like an Mi6 agent, "" not spy"" as quoted from a previous reviewer, we don't get the gadgets controlled plot here, or the bad guy trying to take over the world plot either. As I like to say, Sanchez is just a drug dealer trying to get his piece of the pie, Bond going rouge and using his brains, all his training to take down a drug dealer. Wow what a thought, a whole lot better than Roger Moor's Bond. Plus the fact that even in the end, when Sanchez knows who he is, Bond still gets Sanchez to kill one more member of his organization. Yes it's not over the top, it has no outlandish villan, so what.  No soft core porn, I.E Roger Moor's Bond movies.

I've been watching all of the Bond movies from the beginning, following along with the reviews on The Talk Show podcast on [...] and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Timothy Dalton as James Bond. He was especially refreshing after the level of campiness that Roger Moore had risen to near the end of his run. He added a seriousness to the role that had been missing for some time.",1311724800,4,631,4.266666666666667

Dalton wasn't necessarily a bad Bond - ""The Living Daylights,"" his first flick, was fairly solid - but here he's let down by a dull, derivative script that lacks spark and flair. The look of the film is also drab - the colors, the scenery, the cinematography: it all has the workmanlike look and feel of a middling 80s television show rather than a well-financed entry in a traditionally polished feature film franchise. Add to that the fact that Daltons 007 era had one of the weaker supporting casts (the actors playing M and Moneypenny barely register here, and the villains and Bond women simply bore), and you don't exactly have a recipe for success. Basically, this film is only for Bond diehards - and even they may wince.",1310169600,,764,4.666666666666667

577651,5,6303118259,"1989's ""Licence To Kill"" would mark the final time a Bond film would be made in nearly six years due to legal issues. Unfortunately, it also marked the final time Timothy Dalton would play James Bond. Giving the role his own turn with style, sexiness, and elegance, Timothy never had the chance to grow with the role like other actors, and I have always felt he would still be playing Bond now while in his sixties.

 The plot of ""Licence To Kill"" deals with Bond chasing after a powerful drug lord who killed some of Bond's closest friends. Much of the beautiful scenery took place in Mexico City and the Florida Keys, and those location shoots would become characters of their own in this film as the producers wisely made the choice, like in other Bond movies, to use extraordinary scenery to enhance the story.

 ""Licence To Kill"", however, became a box office disappointment in the U.S., but became huge overseas ultimately bringing in over $150,000,000.",1288915200,2,959,4.759036144578313

577754,1,6303118259,"This in my opinion is the only BAD James Bond movie. Timothy Dalton is a stiff Brit in the worst sense of the stereotype with no sense of humor and he's not even good with the ladies.  This is the James Bond that tries to be Miami Vice, but Dalton is no James Bond and couldn't carry Don Johnson or Philip Michael Thomas's dirty jock water.  Dalton made a good bond premiere with The Living Daylights, but that script was written for Roger Moore.  Dalton stepped in when Moore retired and the light, easy breezy quips and action written for Moore served Dalton well. But Licence To Kill was written specifically for Dalton's take on the character of Bond and it was decided to make Bond like every other stone faced action hero of the time -- can you say Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Shwarzenegger.  The music is underscored and boring, the action is directed poorly along with the story by great Bond veteran Guy Hamiltion who seems to have burned out on this, his final installment. Even the great history of Bond villains takes a hit here with perennial B-movie villain Robert Davi.  Bond even has to follow Fonzie and jump a shark in this film which should tell you something. This goes to show you -- DON""T MESS WITH GREATNESS!  BOND IS BOND AND THAT IS  HOW WE WANT HIM!  The only good thing about this movie is that it was the only Bond movie to bomb at the box office and set the stage for Dalton being fired and the arrival of Pierce Brosnan and return to TOP BOND FORM with GOLDENEYE! Timothy Dalton may be a fine actor in other roles, but as far Bond it was just a bridge too far for his talents. So why you may ask did I buy this movie on Blu-Ray -- simple -- I own all the other Bond films available on Blu Ray and held my nose and bought Licence To Kill in order to to complete my collection.  I never even played the movie.  I put it on my shelf where it collects dust -- forgotten and alone -- just like this Bond movie should.",1269734400,2,1958,4.267567567567568

But overall, better than almost every Roger Moore Bond put together. Certainly lightyears ahead of the last Bronson entry! Recommended for fans of the novels.

Still it beats the boxed set releases, which don't even come with the individual cases.

Timothy Dalton remains my favorite Bond to date (Daniel Craig is growing on me), although I prefer The Living Daylights over this film.  Still there's a lot to like here, including one of my all-time favorite Bond theme songs, sung by Gladys Knight.

A bit of triva:  the movie was intended to be titled ""Licence Revoked"", but the studio changed the title at the last minute due to a Bond novel out at the time called ""Licence Renewed"" (they didn't want people to think it was based on that book) and because Americans associate the phrase with losing one's driver's license!

Unlike LIVING DAYLIGHTS which was originally intended for Pierce Brosnan and reworked for Dalton, this one was specifically designed to showcase Dalton's strengths.  This is a hard-edged Bond (the first to be rated PG-13) and has Bond on a personal vendetta against the Drug Lord who maimed his friend Felix Leiter and murdered Leiter's bride.  His licence to kill revoked, Bond is a renegade.  Good cast with Robert Davi as Sanchez, Carey Lowell as Pam Bovier, Anthony Zerbe as Milton Krest and a young Benecio del Toro as Dario -- one of Sanchez's killers.  A good film but it had the misfortune to come out during a regime change at MGM and dumped out in the same summer as:

MGM through it out with as little publicity as possible.  Some Bond fans love this movie (and I am one) and others absolutely hate it.  There has been a lot of talk that MGM/UA wanted to fire Dalton.  I think -- and this is all speculation -- if Dalton had just one more chance -- a film had come the normal two years later -- he would have been accepted as Bond.  Truth is, the series was declining in popularity -- and the last Moore films can be counted in that -- and ALOT of people really wanted Brosnan to be Bond.  Dalton never got his GOLDFINGER. Roger Moore's 2nd film THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was every bit as much a financial disapoinpment as LICENCE TO KILL. Roger Moore had, with his third Bond, his GOLDFINGER with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.  Dalton never got that chance. It took a six year absence for audiences to want another Bond and Brosnan hit it out of the park with GOLDENEYE -- probably his best film.  Still, with only two films, Timothy Dalton left a memorable impression.  His realistic take on Fleming's Bond would find justification in Daniel Craig's success with CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE.  Like Lazenby's ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, it would stand the test of time.",1252195200,3,2415,4.7614457831325305

577780,5,6303118259,"Licence to Kill is a product of its time.  This James Bond movie was released on the heels of the original ""Die Hard"" and it shares not only a similar feel but also literally takes some of the same elements from that movie.  Oh, and it was also the ""Daniel Craig James Bond movie"" before there was a Daniel Craig James Bond.

Released in the late eighties, this Bond flick was an attempt to modify the traditional Bond formula.  Its basically a revenge picture as Bond attempts to avenge a drug baron's attack upon Felix Leiter and his newlywed bride.  The new element this time was to make the adventure a personal one rather than a mission on behalf of queen and country.

The producers chose a style that embraced a gritty feel before Daniel Craig came along, and they clearly chose Die Hard as a model.  Unlike the would-be tyrants of previous Bond flicks, the villain here shares with Die Hard's heavy the ultimate desire merely to obtain a lot of illegally-procured cash.  Both movies focus upon the villain's point of view and personal frustrations so much that the audience's sympathies are sometimes shared between both hero and villain.

The setting is a little more commonplace this time.  Gone are the previous rocket wrist-bands and Eiffel Tower chases.  There are a lot more conventional automatic weapons, and the vehicles this time include small planes, speedboats and tanker trucks rather than Aston Martins outfitted with built-in arsenals.

Instead of just suggesting Die Hard, ""Licence"" sometimes borrowed the same actors.  The drug lord and the CIA agent here are played by fellow FBI agents(!)from the earlier movie.  If the soundtrack sounds familiar, it's because composer Michael Kamen brought his minimialist style to both films.

That said, the approach works in spades for Licence to Kill.  The stunt-pieces are great, and the pacing is lively.  Timothy Dalton introduced a serious Bond before Daniel Craig, and while opinions vary, I think he made a great Bond.  Most importantly, the essential Bond elements haven't been discarded--the gadgets and the ""Bond girls"" are still there--they just aren't the focus this time.

Technically, this is a great Blu-ray.  This movie has probably never looked better, even during its initial release.  Many of the extras are recycled from previous DVD releases, but they still go into more depth than say, the recent ""Quantum of Solace"" release.

While Licence to Kill was a financial disappointment when it was released, I think history will be kind to this movie and to Timothy Dalton.  It has aged gracefully, and is one of the best in the Bond series.",1242086400,13,2622,4.936073059360731
577781,5,6303118259,"It is kind of sad the bad rap that Timothy Dalton has taken as James Bond, especially when he starred in two excellent Bond films ""The Living Daylights"" and this one.  A little Bond history.  When Roger Moore stepped down as Bond, Timothy Dalton replaced him.  Just like the recent ""Casino Royale,"" ""The Living Daylights"" was an attempt to bring Bond back to basics after the excesses of the Moore years.  Dalton reread the Fleming books and attempted to play Bond as the man of the novels.  There was very little humor and Dalton, like Daniel Craig, had difficulty throwing out the little Bond one-liners the way Connery and Moore did.
""The Living Daylights"" opened in the summer of 1987 and was very successful.  ""License to Kill"" opened in the summer of 1989, a very competitive summer, against the likes of Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" ""Lethal Weapon II,"" ""Ghostbusters 2,"" ""Star Trek V,"" etc.  This film did well overseas but was a flop in the U.S.  After this film, there was six years of litigation between the Bond producers and the studio.  When ""Goldeneye"" was announced in 1995, Dalton elected not to come back and Pierce Brosnan very successfully replaced him.
Since that time Dalton and this film have gotten a very bad rap.  ""License to Kill"" is a terrific Bond film with some great action scenes,especially a wild chase between 4 oil tankers on a winding mountain road, a lot of shooting, a low-flying plane and SAM missiles.  This action scene has to be seen to be believed.  It also has a great villain in Robert Davi, a fairly good leading lady in Carey Lowell, (Dalton had the least interesting leading ladies in his 2 Bonds,) and a very good supporting cast including Anthony Zerbe, Don Stroud, Wayne Newton and the great David Hedison (Capt. Crane,) returning as Felix Leiter.
It is interesting how Dalton's portrayal of Bond is not that far from Daniel Craig's (although Craig's is admittedly a bit more brutish and physical.)  Still Dalton's portrayal of Bond has come to be condemned in recent years (although it wasn't at the time.) Despite all the condemnations of Dalton's portrayal of Bond, he really did star in 2 very good Bond films.
""License to Kill"" has always been one of my favorite Bonds since I saw it that summer of '89.  Check it out, I'm sure you will enjoy it too.",1241568000,17,2337,4.696078431372549

Had Dalton continued as Bond, I'm sure he would bring just as much grit and touchness as the current Bond who I also like--Daniel Craig.",1240099200,,446,4.6455696202531644

I eagerly went to see it when it opened in 1989, hoping it would be a solid follow-up to The Living Daylights, an engaging yarn featuring a largely-unknown but impressive, intense (and unfairly maligned) actor named Timothy Dalton.  But LTC proved a disappointment.  It was unexpectedly violent and dark (though that didn't hurt the excellent Casino Royale), had that weird silver/gray palette of the 80s, and included a number of elements that can best be described as cheesy, e.g. the gray morning coats and Ascot ties of the opening scene, several unfunny efforts at humor, Robert Davi's over-the-top villain, Dalton's hairstyle, and ...  Wayne Newton??  Compared to its predecessor, LTC was an even bigger disappointment than Quantum of Solace (2008).

577899,1,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton played Bond pretty well in this movie - very similar to Craig's Bond in terms of under the surface violent boil. But Dalton is just too swarmy to be Bond. Robert Davi is also good as Sanchez, though his character is more suited to an episode of Miami Vice than 007.

There has never been a worse supporting cast in a Bond movie.  From the very first scene, I was wincing at poorly played lines.  The actors -- and I use that term liberally -- look like they are reading off cue cards.  David Hedison particularly embarasses himself as Felix Leiter. Carey Lowell is beyond terrible - continuing a Bond tradition of looks-before-ability female casting.

The production values of this movie are Made for TV.  So many of the set pieces look like they could have been featured on an episode of the A-Team.  Is that a Grand Marquis Bond in driving?  Many of the props look like carboard cut outs.  Even the film quality seems shabby.

577903,2,6303118259,"I have watched the whole JB series in chronological order several times now.  I have not reviewed each one on Amazon, but felt compelled to advise others about License to Kill.  I have cringed each time it's time to view this movie, and have decided to rarely if ever watch it again.

Why?

Well, first of all, a disclosure.  I like Roger Moore's Bond.  I like Sean Connery too.  I like the silly 1960's special effects for what they are, and the gadgets, the girls, the whole semi-unrealistic but fun plot devices and production values.  But as you may have read in other reviews, this movie deviates from all of those.

The opening theme, looking down the gun barrel is awful.  The unnecessary and disgusting ""give her his heart"" scene gave me nightmares in 1989 and still is bothersome.  The lack of an MI6-backed mission is uninteresting.  And why, oh why, does Felix Leiter get knocked-off every few films, then magically brought back to life?  (or in this case, half-eaten)

Yes, I know, Ian Fleming's novels are grittier than the films.  One Amazon reviewer noted the shark scene is right out of the novel ""Live and Let Die"".  Well, that is another one of my least-liked Bond films, and for much the same reason I don't like this film.  The sense of death and maiming is palpable.  The good guy doesn't really win.  Europeans sometimes are said to like tragedy versus redemption.  Maybe, but you have to be interested in the characters, and I'm not in this film -- or at least the characters that are still alive.

Some people would point out that all Bond films are not exactly supposed to be harmless romps through the playground, but this is all about entertainment, not about how close can we make a movie that mimics what Columbia drug lords really have done to people in graphic detail.  It's too bad for Dalton, who's acting is quite respectable.

So, if by some chance you are a Bond fan and still haven't seen this film, hopefully the above will allow some manner for you to interpret the feel of this movie.  But I would rather watch the off-kilter Never Say Never Again than License To Kill.",1218067200,,2109,4.577540106951871

I have purchased some of the Bond movies on VHS and DVD, but I never purchased a set before because it didn't include ALL the movies. I didn't like someone else deciding which ones were important.

When I saw the 007 James Bond Ultimate Collection Set, I thought they finially came out with a set worth buying. To me, not having all the movies was an incomplete collection. This was the only reason I decided to buy this 007 Bond set.

When it arrived I was excited but I didn't think I'd have time to watch any of them for awhile. Then I found time in the afternoon and popped in For Your Eyes Only, to see how the set looked and played. I was stunned!!! What a incredible picture in WIDESCREEN and Dolby D surround sound. I have a 53 inch widescreen HDTV with a surround home theater sound system. It was like watching a brand new released movie.

Clearly the movie had been restored, and what a great job. I was not aware the films were restored since I don't pay attention to news releases about things like that.

When the movie was over, I had to see what they had done to Dr. No. Again I was impressed, though this is not in widescreen, but it is in Dolby D sound, and the same with From Russia with Love. I was so impressed I couldn't stop watching them and my work projects suffered, but I'm having a great time watching these Bond movies even better then they were in the theater.

But in ""Licence to Kill"", Timothy Dalton grew into the character and made it his own rather than trying to mimick Roger Moore. It's a darker James Bond than before, this time motivated by revenge. The story is less extravagant than some of the earlier movies - the villain is no super terrorist or megalomaniac but a South American drug lord - but the action is great. Robert Davi is a good villian and a young Benicio del Toro plays one of his henchmen. It is a pity Dalton quit after this movie.

577907,2,6303118259,"Although Moonraker is the popular fan favorite for worst Bond movie, Licence To Kill runs it a close second. Whereas the Moore films had a fairly gradual lowering of standards, the superiority of The Living Daylights made the drop in quality of LTK seem that much more dramatic. The lowest-grossing movie in the series' history, it's a classic case of the road to hell being paved with good intentions. ""This time Bond bleeds,"" claimed the producers, promising a tougher, more credible Bond film only to lack the nerve to deliver on their promise. Instead they wimped out and delivered something distinctly half-hearted that adheres to many of the weakest elements of the Bond formula but which throws out much of what makes Bond himself Bond in a disastrously counterproductive attempt to widen the series' appeal in the US market. Change the main character's name and you'd never know it was a Bond film - the character has been pared down and simplified to such an extent that there's little relation either to the previous films or even Fleming's novels (despite using aspects of Fleming's Live and Let Die). Casino Royale got around having Bond as a blunt instrument by showing the character develop, but in LTK he's just a standard issue guy they pushed too far. The result is a standard issue OTT 80s action movie that owes more to Commando and Elmore Leonard's 52 Pickup and The Tall T and which feels like Lethal Weapon 2 had it been remade with Roger Moore.

It has some novelty value as the only film where Bond isn't a secret agent, though turning him into just another vigilante is a big part of the problem. This time Bond goes against his superiors, his licence to kill revoked, to extract bloody revenge on the drug lord who fed Felix Leiter's legs to a shark and killed the CIA man's wife. But where The Living Daylights made the most of its narrative economy, here script, editing, scoring and direction all combine to provide a lack of momentum - poorly paced, this feels a good half hour too long. Frustratingly there is the occasional germ of a good idea, such as Bond blundering into and compromising wider issues with his vendetta, but they are never pursued. Rather than explore the increasingly fine line between good or evil or the psychosis that Bond's quest should hint at, it simply spends most of its running time coming up with unimaginative ways to kill the bad guys. This Bond makes no demands on his audience.

Almost nothing in the picture works on any terms. It's certainly in no way the gritty, realistic or down to Earth movie its supporters frequently claim. Wayne Newton playing a comic religious cult leader, Bond and Felix Leiter parachuting into a wedding in full morning suit attire (in a remarkably clumsily sped-up shot) after a midair hijack of a plane, Uncle Q coming along for comic relief on what's supposed to be a grim revenge mission, inept comedy ninjas, the obligatory villain's giant lair being blown up and an exploding head almost as ridiculous as the inflatable Yaphet Kotto in Live and Let Die are hardly the stuff of The French Connection, and nor is the surprisingly weak villain (the curse of the Dalton films). Sanchez may work on paper, but onscreen he's a damp squib, which is surprising as Robert Davi has repeatedly shown - as had Jeroen Krabbe before him - that outside Bond he could deliver real menace. There's certainly a potentially more interesting character there than the script allows Davi to show. The Bond girls are pretty atrociously written too: to see Talisa Soto's ""I love him so much"" moment is to know pain. Even Dalton, so impressive in The Living Daylights, is a lot less impressive second time round despite his best efforts.

Worse, it doesn't work as either a Bond film or as a standalone action movie: like too many of the weaker Bond films, if it weren't for the Bond brand and the loyalty the series has it probably would have sunk into obscurity long ago taken purely on its own merits as a film. In some ways it's a bold attempt to shake up the franchise, but that's the saddest thing about it. About the only two scenes that do work are when Bond throws a suitcase filled with a blood money at a heavy balanced on the edge of a shark tank (hardly a giant leap from [I] ""Where's Fekkish?"", ""You've had your six"" or Moore kicking a car containing a killer off a cliff in previous entries) or the factory scene where he's trying to disguise himself from Benicio Del Toro. Elsewhere it's certainly no harsher nor more serious than previous efforts: even Felix doesn't seem that bothered over his wife's rape and murder and is able to laugh it off by the end of the film.

There are also a lot of plot holes and absurdities: just why does Bond attack the MI5 agents after his licence to kill is revoked and why does M suddenly have his minions shooting at his most valuable agent? Why exactly are inept suicidal Japanese ninjas working for the HONG KONG Narcotics Agency? Why, in a moment that could have come out of a Leslie Nielson film, does one tiny fire in an enclosed laboratory within seconds become an impossible-to-extinguish raging inferno that causes a massive complex to blow up? Well, because someone thought they'd make for cool scenes is about the only explanation.

It's possible this could have been made to work with a more assured sense of tone, but the larky mood, cheap gags and poor execution do it no favors. Maybe a John McTiernan could have done something with the material even with such a weak script and no chance of proper rewrites due to the writers' strike, but John Glen just flattens it all with his lazy direction. It's professionally made but it fatally lacks the courage to go all the way in the way that Casino Royale did. LTK is like a nervous bather, constantly dipping one toe in the water only to almost immediately draw back to its imagined comfort zone. Even Moonraker, bad as it was, knew exactly what kind of film it was and stayed true to itself. Alone among the Bond films, LTK is the one people constantly have to make excuses for.

New extras for the two-disc Ultimate Edition are fairly thin - 9 deleted scenes, one of Bond unpacking in a hotel room while watching TV coverage of Sanchez arriving at a charity gala good enough to have stayed in the film - location scouting footage, archive interviews with John Glen and interview footage from 1989, with the extras from the original release carried over.",1202860800,4,6446,4.65

577977,4,6303118259,"A real return to form for the flagging franchise, this movie represents a brave departure from the producers, bringing Bond back to Fleming's `blunt instrument'.  Before Casino Royale, this is the previous attempt to have a Bond who gets bloodied and bruised, and whose own motivations are more important than duty to Queen and Country.
When Bond's CIA buddy Felix Leiter is fed to the sharks by drug baron Sanchez (a satisfyingly nasty Robert Davi) and his henchman (played by Benicio del Toro, in his first screen role), Bond goes out for revenge.
There are some spurious notes, such as the License to Kill being revoked, then just as easily being restored at the end of the movie, and there are some periods that flag a little in the pacing, due in part to the film taking itself a little too seriously for a Bond movie.  However, when the action does start, there are some terrific set pieces, notably, the truck chase at the end.
In the acting department, aforementioned villains are fine, Wayne Newton has a cameo in a running gag as a phony tele-evangelist (Bless his heart), Q plays his biggest role in a Bond movie to date, and Talisa Soto plays the villains beautiful kept lady.  If only she could act...
The female lead is the CIA agent helping Bond, Carey Lowell (Richard Gere's squeeze).  It is a surprisingly strong role for a woman in a Bond movie, independent and Bond's equal in many ways, a far cry from the standard girl on the sidelines in a bikini crying `James, James!'.
Alas, at the time, the world was not ready for a non-humorous Bond, and while a success, it was less of a success than previous Bond movies, and there followed a gap of 6 years before Bond returned, without Dalton.  It's a shame, because this is a movie worth rediscovering, as long as you can take your Bond without the one-liners and the smirk.

Technically the film is immaculate and dts mix is crystal clear and uses sparing but effective surround effects, notably in the action scenes.  Extras are brimming over, with location scouting home videos, deleted scenes (none particularly vital) and various production featurettes.  I particularly enjoyed  the stories of the haunted set and hand of fire, included in the `Inside A Licence to Kill' documentary.  As in the previous Dalton outing, he is notably absent from the docs, but all other players are represented.

John Glen reckoned this was his best work.  I am inclined to agree with him, and in this package there just could not be any other extras you would want from a movie.  4 and a half stars - rounded down to 4 for being just a little too dry and ponderous in places...",1197331200,,2630,4.642241379310345
577978,4,6303118259,"Licence to Kill is a very unique Bond adventure, where Bond doesn't act quite like himself.  While usually setting personal feelings aside for the good of Queen and country, Bond takes the other route in this adventure - resigning from the service to go on a personal vendetta.  Felix Leiter gets his most important role yet in a Bond film, being the sole reason Bond is out for revenge.

Felix Leiter is head of CIA, has appeared in numerous Bond films, and aids Bond on most of his missions - and even saves his neck a time or two.  The annoying thing about Leiter is he is always played by a different actor in every Bond film (and has even been payed by a black actor in the new Casino Royale film).  In Licence to Kill, the same actor who played Leiter in Live and Let Die makes a return, and that being enough to make him my favorite Leiter actor.

The pre-credits of the film begins in the gorgeous Florida keys, where the movie's villain - Franz Sanchez - and his gang are on a private plane to pick up his girl, who has evaded him, in the Bahamas.  On the way to his wedding, Leiter (and best man Bond) intercept Sanchez and put him away.  With the right help, Sanchez makes his escape before making it to prison, and his gang of men attack Felix and his new wife.  Frustrated that the CIA won't do anything, Bond defies orders of England and heads to a city known as ""Isthmus"" to track down and kill Sanchez.

Most people dislike this film because it does not have the feel of a Bond movie at all.  For that same reason, I actually enjoyed this quite a bit.  I agree, the revenge thing is very untypical, but it felt nice to see a different side of Bond for once, and Timothy Dalton (after his nice performance in Living Daylights) seemed like the right man for the job.  Unfortunately, this would be his last Bond film.  Despite the different feel of the story, the movie is very entertaining, but only to a point.  The action is superb, but somewhat limited to what it could be.  The locations in and around Key West are teriffic, but exotic locations stop there.  The charcaters are a  mixed bag.  I enjoyed the villain Sanchez and his henchman - Dario - but the other goons and the bond girls were duds.  Q actually gets more of a role in this film than what is typical of him.

Overall, this movie is lots of fun, but not nearly up to par with many Bond films.  The bright spots are the locations and camera shots in and around the Keys, the highly exciting gas tanker chase scene, and the main villain.  And though many would disgree, I enjoyed seeing a different side of Bond for once.

577979,4,6303118259,"After his close friend is ruthlessly tortured on his wedding day and his friends wife is brutally killed, agent 007 goes undercover to try to find (and kill) those responsible. His mission leads him to a tropical paradise run by a ruthless drug lord and his equally ruthless army of thugs.

Like 1973's ""Live and Let Die"" and 1974's ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", the plot to ""Licence to Kill"" is small potatoes when compared to the big, megalomaniacal plots that involve world domination and mass destruction of other Bond films but like its predecessors, there is more than enough opportunity here to give Bond a chance to showcase some of his innovative gadgets and dazzling stunt work. Like Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and practically every other Bond who is not Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton as 007 is either loved or despised. I personally think he makes a fantastic James Bond. I admit I have never read the books, I have only seen the films but many have stated that Dalton's portrayal is spot on and it does differ greatly from that of Moore's and even Connery's. Dalton is more stone-faced, a bit more athletic and although I am not a huge fan of his first outing, ""The Living Daylights"" which was fun but not great, I did find his performance in both films fantastic. He is tougher, meaner, grittier; his style suits the cinematic character well and although I will always have a soft spot for both Connery and Moore, I do prefer Dalton over the tuxedo clad Pierce Brosnan, who had the right look but also had the misfortune of appearing in the more lack-lustre entries of the series.

The film also has a great supporting cast; Robert Davi, Priscilla Barnes (of ""Three's Company"" fame), Benicio Del Toro, Wayne Newton. Del Toro is especially chilling as one of Sanchez's side-kicks. His part is not big and he doesn't have much dialogue but his menacing stare says it all. The location shots, as expected, are beautiful (filmed in Florida and Mexico if not mistaken) and the Bond girls are gorgeous physically but they are a hit and a miss. The leading Bond girl, Carey Lowell is delightful. A tall, tough, steely faced beauty with killer legs and charisma to boot. A more than fitting ally to this more aggressive Bond. Talisa Soto on the other hand is a definite miss. Emotionless, stiff and uninspired; she's lovely to look at but her performance is wooden and her face, devoid of any expression outside of boredom.

The action sequences, in typical Bond fashion, are good and cleverly executed. The climactic truck chase scene is a definite highlight. Some reviewers have criticized some of the deaths scene claiming they are too grisly for a Bond feature. I have to agree. Although, aside from one sequence, visually, these death scenes are not too graphic but what is implied can be just as disturbing. Then again, in previous installments we had a woman eaten alive by pesky piranha's and another one fed to a hungry shark.

Overall, ""Licence to Kill"" is a worthy addition to the 007 series. It delivers the goods but it is miles away from being the best. With that said, the film and Dalton are definitely under-rated in my opinion and Lowell is a Bond girl that is worthy of your time and should be seen in action.

577984,5,6303118259,"When I first saw this film I remember that it really broke my heart. I grew up in the 60s on James Bond and Sean Connery amongst others. The first 45 minutes of ""Moonraker"" was the closest that the Roger Moore Bonds had ever come to the look and feel of the James Bond films of the 60s. It was really incredible. Equally incredible was how the film did a flip-flop into slapstick when Bond is floating down that canal in Venice. As the film progressed the level of slapstick escalated. It was just plain out ridicules. The film was very annoying.

I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.

When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now. I suppose with each decade another generation of Bond fans is born. Each generation takes with them the fond memories of their introduction to James Bond. Each generation savors the moment and no matter what I or anyone else says is going to erase those memories. The magic of ""Moonraker"" is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series.

578053,4,6303118259,"By the time Timothy Dalton took over the role of James Bond I had pretty much checked out. Although I enjoyed Sean Connery, and was OK with George Lazenby, I hated the Roger Moore era. So when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Living-Daylights/dp/B000NDEXPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Living Daylights</a>&nbsp;came out I just ignored it. Two years later, here comes License to Kill and from watching the previews I was intrigued. When I watched the film I found myself enjoying it much more than anticipated. It's probably fourth on my list behind Thunderball, Goldfinger, and the new Casino Royal.

Why I like this is because for really the first time we see the role start to get closer to the James Bond of the Ian Fleming novels. In those books, Bond was a lonely, brutal, and basically tragic figure. Although he could be sophisticated when needed he had no problem with killing. In essence, he was a Government Assassin, nothing more, and given the toughest assignments. In the first three Connery films we see bits of that but as the series progresed the character started to become more gentlemanly, more refined. Then as Moore took over the role Bond, and the movies in general became overbearing and silly. Here is this ""Secret Agent"" and everyone knows who he is. Kind of defeats the purpose of being a secret agent, doesn't it. And the constant wisecracking...yuck! The only humor in the Fleming books was the running gag, if you will, of Feliz Leiter getting parts of his body mutilated in almost every book. By the final book, ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" I think he was down to one leg and part of an arm.

So here came Dalton in ""License to Kill"" and we're treated to a great opening, although a little campy with parachuting to Leiter's wedding. As the movie gets going Leiter is partially fed to a shark (actually, this scene is straight out of the second Fleming book ""Live & Let Die""), and his new wife is murdered. This sets off Bond to revenge the acts by trying to kill the drug lord who ordered it. Along the way, he has no problem killing any one who gets in his way. And what really sealed my pleasure of the film, Bond doesn't wise crack his way through the movie, those come from the drug lord, played by Robert Davi. To go further would spoil the many nice surprises so I won't.

Alas, this film was just an island surrounded by mediocre efforts. As Pierce Brosnan took over we're back to a more sohistacated Bond who wisecracks. Not nearly as bad as Moore but not as good as Dalton, much less Connery.

ON SALE I PAID 74.99 AND THE OTHER TWO SETS WOULD HAVE COST 89.00 A PIECE AND I NEVER GOT AROUND TO AFFORDING TO BUY THE REST OF THEM. THIS ULTIMATE SET IS SO MUCH BETTER, FIRST OF ALL THE SLIM CASES THE DVD'S COME IN ARE AWESOME AND THEN THERE ARE EXTRAS ON THE DVD THAT WERE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE OTHER SET THAT I BOUGHT. THE COST OF THE ULTIMATE EDITION SET THAT YOU OFFER IS AND EXCELLENT PRICE AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY CUSTOMER LOOKING FOR JAMES BOND MOVIES IN A SET.I AM GOING TO GIVE THAT OTHER 1ST SERIES TO SOME FRIENDS OF OURS BECAUSE WE WILL NEVER WATCH THAT SET AGAIN NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE JAMES BOND SET. THANK YOU AMAZON.COM FOR OFFERING SUCH A WONDERFUL DEAL ON THIS ULTIMATE SET AND WE ARE THOROUGHLY ENJOYING IT. I FORGOT TO ORDER THE LATEST JAMES BOND MOVIE THOUGH CALLED CASINO ROYALE SO I WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE SET. I RENTED CASINO ROYALE WITH JAMES BOND WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND IT IS EXCELLANT AND I WISH TO RECOMMEND IT ALSO AND TO EVENTUALLY ADD IT TO OUR COLLECTION. LET ME ADD TO MY REVIEW THAT THE ULTIMATE EDITION SET INCLUDES EVERY MOVIE JAMES BOND EVER MADE EXCEPT TWO AND THEY TELL YOU WHICH TWO AND GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ORDER THOSE TWO ALONG WITH THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION SET.

1. Goldeneye - new one is cropped throughout entire film.

2. On Her Majesty's Secret Service - new one has 'blue' color correction to opening sequence. I think the original is what was actually filmed; however after that, the new one beats it by a mile. All scratches are gone and much more detail can be seen.

3. The Spy Who Loved Me - I feel there is an over-sharpening of the picture.

4. Die Another Day - 2nd disc of extras from original release is not included here.

I also had trouble with From Russia With Love playing in one of my older players - but all the others were fine.

Note that I'm being picky here, these are great sets and I had the opportunity to keep some of my old ones, I wouldn't really hunt down the old ones otherwise.",1178582400,2,923,4.215909090909091

Then a friend showed me the new transfer of 'Goldfinger' and I realized that this would be a worthy addition to my collection.  These films have never looked better.  I certainly don't have the ideal set up for films (no LCD TV .... yet), though I do have 5.1 audio and component (re:'colourstream') input on my tv.  The prints are clean with great colour and detail that kicks the previous releases to the curb.  I compared 'Goldeneye' and 'Tomorrow Never Dies' to their previous DVD releases and noticed an improvement in the transfer.  The older films really benefit from the care that Lowry Digital has taken in the restoration process; though you would never quite mistake the older films for something that was produced recently (based on video quality).

While I haven't delved into the comprehensive special features quite as much as I would like, so far they certainly cover everything that one could possibly want to know about the production and release of these films (within reason - the older films lack some features just because of the time they were produced in).

I won't spend time reviewing each film, because you either know the films or you don't, and to an extent they are critic proof.  Though some are certainly worse than others, in my mind at least (I'm looking at you, Sir Roger Moore).

Though I was disappointed that the ""Inside..."" documentaries featuring Patrick Macnee's narration stopped at License to Kill, there are enough extras to nearly make up for this oversight.

This bundle of box sets is really the way to go both for price and the fact that you get all the films at once. I really do not understand why the marketing ""geniuses"" at MGM/Sony pictures saw fit to place the movies into sets in such a random way.

578260,5,6303118259,"The Ultimate Bond Collection is sure must in any Bond fan collection, or even in any Action Movie collection.

Not only do we get all the movies, and I mean all 20 of them, in a fully digitally restored image, but also in full Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound, not forgetting the DTS system also included...

Can you imagine watching Dr. No or Goldfinger in this manner? Or even Live and Let Die or The Man with the Golden Gun this way?

Simply spectacular.

Although there are some differences in the special features included here, compared to those offered in the equivalent Special Editions, which I would keep just for this reason, if you, like me still have them, instead of simply discard them from your shelves.

Also, the accompanying booklets are nice, but not as colorful as their Special Edition counterparts.

But as far as the main content, which after all are the DVDs, the Ultimate Collection is light years away from their previous releases.

Unless you want to wait until the entire collection is once again re-released, and this time on HD-DVD, which I sincerely doubt, I don't think they will give more impact to the movies themselves (you will still have to wait a couple of years, before the HD-DVD revolution truly takes in the hearts and minds  of people - besides, there are even newer developments... so don't hold your breath for this).

The only two negative points here are just minor ones.

One is the everlasting question about the final scene in ""From Russia with Love"", on the Venice canals, in which James Bond (Sean Connery) and Tanja Romanova (Daniela Bianchi) are scrutinizing the secret ""blue"" movie taken by the Russians in the Hotel room in Istanbul, earlier in the movie, when Bond meets Tanja for the first time.

The full scene included some additional comments which were cut at the time, due to censorship problems. But today we are all grown-ups and therefore I would have appreciated, if they had it reintegrated as it seemed to be in the intentions of the Producers.

But then again, who knows, maybe the material was lost in the meanwhile (although I doubt it, because on at least on a videotape release I used to own from England, the entire scene was shown, unfortunately I don't have it anymore).

The second point is that they left Madonna's videoclip of her song for ""Die Another Day"", together with the ""Making Of"" of the same, out of this DVD release.

So, if you still own the Special Edition of ""Die Another Day"", do not get rid of it as yet, unless of course, you don't really care for that particular videoclip.

That's all.

The DTS soundtrack is a plus in this collection. If you own a DTS capable DVD player, put it on and you will experience these movies as you never have before, it is far better than the just conventional Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound also included.

What can I add beyond all of this? Absolutely nothing.

If you have appreciated the Special Editions, you will absolutely be overjoyed in having the Ultimate Edition.

the clarity also and the extras that come are most entertaining for we Bond Fans.

However, mere days after I purchased this set, Amazon temporarily dropped the price (significantly, by about a third).

578268,4,6303118259,"Dalton performed the character perhaps closest to that of the novels but it cost him some of the over-the-top fun that the movies brought to the part.  He was looked at to replace Connery but was seen to be too young at the time.  Both of Dalton's films have the awkward combination of old style (even ""silly"") Bond and the ""modern"", realistic style that film audiences want today.  Maybe these are the teen-age years for the series.  Licence to Kill is the better of the two and borrows an unused storyline from the novel Dr. No to send Bond on a mission with more grit and seriousness than we have seen before.  Robert Davi makes a great Bond villain without trying to take over the world.  One treat is seeing a young Benicio Del Toro as the evil henchman.  The drawback to the film is the serious-silly-serious nature to the story that gives the film an uneven feel.  For example, the finale is exciting but marred by two stunts in particular.  One looks fantastic but makes no sense and another (this doesn't ruin anything) where a semi does a wheelie is just plain stupid.  Overdone stunts can be fine (except semi wheelies) but not when you are trying to make a more down to earth Bond film.  The film is still worth seeing and has enough action to satisfy even non-Bond fans.  Dalton should have been able to make at least one more Bond film and if the improvements from The Living Daylights to here had continued, his work in the series would have been more respected.  Actually, because he played a more serious Bond, he is probably the only one of the actors who could pull off an older James Bond.

578345,5,6303118259,"Before buying this collection, I was very skeptical. Being a long time James Bond fan, I invested plenty of money in the best VHS version of all these films. When DVD came out, I re-bought about half of the collection again. I must admit that the DVD releases of these films are some of the most disappointing DVDs in my collection.

My major complaints about the ORIGINAL DVD RELEASES were:

1.) Audio Mix -- The first release of the Bond DVDs featured only the original 2 channel audio mixes. The result was a disaster. The spoken dialog was BURIED under the soundtrack... resulting in me having to dive for the remote every five minutes. On top of the poor dialog / score mixing, the audio lacked definition and served as a constant distraction from watching the movie. There were no distinct lows, or distinct highs, just a lot of bland sounding audio.

2.) Picture Quality -- I suppose I couldn't complain too too much about this one. Given the age of many of these movies, I accepted the washed-out, often grainy image as nothing more than a symptom of the era the movie was made.

All in all, poor audio and poor picture makes for a pretty crappy experience. After having been disappointed by the first couple Bond DVDs I bought, I gave up on the collection. It was with this in mind that the announcement of the newly remastered series left me very skeptical.

The major criticism of this DVD set is that it is another ploy by MGM/UA to drain more money from every Bond fan's wallet. In the past, I had avoided these pathetic attempts at getting me to constantly upgrade versions of things I already owned.

However, let me tell you, this collection DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. The talk about the upgraded audio and video is NOT hype. Painstaking efforts were taken to re-scan the original prints of each film frame-by-frame. Once scanned, the image was digitally enhanced from the original prints. I was amazed at the richness and depth of color this process produced. During most parts, these movies look like they could have been filmed last year. Different color pigments are more noticeable, skin color and tone looks more lifelike, and the special effects look sharper. All in all, one couldn't ask for anything more from the picture quality of these versions. I have yet to a scene where I felt it could have been retouched better.

If the image quality isn't enough to make this collection worth buying, the new 5.1 DTS mixes seal the deal. Gone are the days of me fidgeting with volume during every other scene! The balance between dialog, ambient sounds, and score is perfect. I never would have imagined that movies made in the 60's and 70's could sound so good. Unlike the previous DVDs, these Ultimate Edition DVDs utilize my home theater to its maximum potential. Explosions rumble through my sub and the dialog comes clearly through my center channel; every word is audible. I own other DVDs from films made over the last couple of years that wish they could sound this good! Utilizing the DTS is a MUST!

Finally, while I consider myself fairly discriminating when it comes to audio and video clarity, I am by no means an audio or videophile. So, I don't think you need a $25,000 home theater setup to enjoy the enhancements these DVDs offer. I wrote this review based off of the following hardware:

32"" Winbook 720p LCD HDTV

Up-converting Samsung DVD Player (connected via DVI)

Sony 7.1 (7x100w) Surround Receiver

Matching 5.1 MTX Surround Sound Speaker System

Hopefully, this will help clear up some confusion or doubt as to the value this collection offers.",1173830400,13,3582,4.712

578347,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton returned two years after his successful debut as Bond in ""The Living Daylights"" with his second and final Bond film.  Unfortunately for Dalton the producers decided that Bond's character in this movie was out of character by being out for vengeance rather than Queen and country, and Dalton's role as Bond was at an end.  Unfortunately, it would be six years to the next Bond movie.

The movie begins with the capture of ruthless drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi).  Shortly thereafter we see Felix Leiter (David Hedison) and Della Churchill (Priscilla Barnes) wed.  However, Sanchez escapes from custody and returns to exact his own revenge on Leiter and his new wife.  Bond is the first to discover what Sanchez has done and decides to take action on his own.  It is during this portion of the movie that M (Robert Brown) revokes Bond's license to kill, and Bond is treated as a rogue agent for most of the rest of the movie.

Bond tracks Sanchez and attempts to kill him.  When his attempt is unsuccessful, he inadvertently gains Sanchez's confidence, and continues to work toward finding a way to bring Sanchez to justice.  During his various escapades Bond manages to have Sanchez eliminate one of his own men, steals millions of dollars, and destroys more millions in heroin.

The highlight of this movie is the final scenes involving a huge facility that is the headquarters for Sanchez and a group of escaping tractor-trailers.  The tractor-trailers, provided by Kenworth, perform a series of stunts that I believe remain unique to this movie, including driving on one set of wheels and popping a wheelie.

This two disk set is loaded with extras, including videos, making of features, documentaries and much more.  This particular disk is quite an improvement over previous releases for the extras.

As with most movies, this movie had a number of errors that I can generally forgive.  However, when the air hose is cut on a tractor-trailer the brakes lock on, not fail as shown in the movie.  I find that technical error to be glaring each time I watch this movie.  There are other errors that I am sure were put in to spice up the action.  Electric eels do not generate light when they shock someone, as happened when a guard fell into a tank of eels.  You can barely see some laser beams, and many high-powered lasers are invisible, rather than the bright red beam shown when Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) fires a laser in a hotel room.  Also, you might want to note how $2 million in twenty dollar bills fit into one brief case, which is impossible.

This Bond movie was different in flavor from previous Bond movies.  The violence was elevated to achieve the first PG-13 rating for a Bond film.  Bond shows a weakness not shown in any previous Bond movie.  I was also a little disappointed that Bond was after a drug lord rather than a megalomaniac.  Drug dealers have always seemed to me to be below Bond.  However, I did not get to make that choice.

With all the weaknesses in Bond's character and in the film, I enjoy this movie.  The pacing is steady and quick.  A viewer can only spot most of the implausibilities by watching the movie multiple times.  The end chase scene with the tanker trucks is a joy to watch again and again.  I think it is unfortunate that Timothy Dalton was not permitted to appear in another Bond movie, because he brought a powerful and unique interpretation to Bond, making Bond his own.

578452,5,6303118259,"This review is designed to assist individuals who are on the fence about upgrading from the previously released Special Edition (SE) DVDs to the Ultimate Edition (UE) DVDs. I do not profess to be an audiophile or videophile, so I won't be bandying about terminology like compression and low-end frequency loss (I'm trying to help you, not impress you). On the other hand, I do comprehend technical terms and realize the importance of presentation and quality; however, this information is for the benefit of the average consumer.

Like so many others, the first thought that came to mind following the announcement of the UE DVD project was 'corporate greed.' My perspective has since changed considerably. In the wake of Sony's acquisition of MGM/UA, there is no doubt that the new parent company is looking to exploit the series for maximum profit. But at least Sony has the resources to do it right.

My waning interest in the Bond series was reinvigorated with the release of ""Casino Royale"" in 2006, an exceptional reboot which compensates for the disappointing Brosnan era. Given that event, I wanted to revisit the older films, only to discover that the SE DVDs looked less than impressive on a contemporary LCD television. At that point, I wondered if the UE DVDs might live up to the marketing hype.

I always read product reviews on this website to help guide my purchases. I'm equally amused and annoyed by hardcore technophiles who point out 'mistakes' in the UE DVDs - 'Felix Leiter's pants are the wrong color,' 'reverb on the gunshot ricochet is too heavy,' etc. I'm quite certain that none of these amateur critics have ever been employed by EON Productions, United Artists, or MGM, and have never seen an original master film print. Thus they are not credible reference sources for interpreting the artistic vision of the filmmakers. While no one is perfect, I am convinced that the professionals at Lowry/DTS Digital Images went above and beyond to ensure that the finished products accurately reflect how the films should properly appear and sound.

Another factor to bear in mind is that everyone's home theater setup is different, thus audio and video reproduction may vary considerably. Very few of those 'expert' reviewers describe their home theater configurations; however I expect that they all have high-end equipment with optimized settings. I also assume that none of them suffer from color blindness, hearing loss, or any other condition that might invalidate their comments. The average Joe can't distinguish between cerulean and cobalt, and doesn't have a basement that resembles the local Cineplex. For the record, I am viewing the films using a Samsung DVD R-120 directly connected to a Samsung LNR328W 32 inch LCD HDTV using Monster component cables, with sound directly output to Bose Cinemate speakers (2.1 channel stereo).

IMAGE: The clarity, color tones, and level of detail are truly amazing, with the restoration giving an almost three dimensional effect to the picture. There is no absolutely no visible film damage or anomalies such as dust, scratches, hairs, etc. like that which plagued all previous releases. It's like watching a new print, only better.

SOUND: While I don't have 5.1 channel surround sound, the Dolby Digital stereo output is just as revelatory as the restored image. Although I can't comment on surround sound effects and DTS output quality, I can say that the soundtrack (music, dialogue, and effects) is properly balanced for the first time on any video release. I find myself fully hearing and completely understanding many lines of dialogue for the first time. The stereo remixing on the earlier films is subtle but contributes exceptionally to the viewing experience. However, if you prefer the original mono soundtrack, that is an option in the setup menu.

SPECIAL FEATURES: Almost all of the special features available on the SE DVDs have been transferred over to the UE DVDs (""Die Another Day"" being the exception), and are joined by new content. Some of the new material is fascinating (period interviews and footage), while other segments are less than enthralling (storyboard sequences). I've not listened to any of Roger Moore's running commentaries, but I rarely watch any DVD in that manner. In short, the original behind-the-scenes documentaries carried over from the SE DVDs still make for the most enlightening viewing.

PACKAGING: It doesn't take a high-paid marketing executive to figure out that if the films were released in four chronologically ordered box sets, the first two boxes would substantially outsell the latter two: this explains why the series was jumbled around. Considering that serious fans will want the entire series anyway, this frequently documented complaint seems petty. Regarding the storage devices (boxes and cases), I often read gripes that the individual movies can't be sequenced into the proper order because the boxes have the film titles printed on the spines. Again, this is a trivial grievance. Reviewers are split over the slimline double-disc cases, some preferring the space-saving measure, while others finding them cheap-looking and not as presentable (I agree with both sides). Because the cases can't hold the accompanying booklets, that paperwork is deposited into one side of the box. I've always found those booklets to be superfluous anyway, and they're not included with the single disc releases.

TECHNICAL ISSUES: Some reviewers have reported experiencing freezing and pixeling during playback of some discs, beyond the usual shift between disc layers. May I suggest that it is not a defective DVD, but rather performance issues with one's player. I had similar problems with ""O.H.M.S.S."" and other non-UE discs played on my Samsung, however the discs played fine on another unit or my PC.

Since the start of the home video market, the Bond films have been released in nearly every format: VHS (through CBS/FOX and then MGM/UA), Laserdisc, RCA SelectaVision (remember that one?), Pioneer VCD, and DVD (initial releases were THX in cardboard snap cases). To play devil's advocate for a moment, the specifications of Lowry's restoration and digital transfer process will allow for full 1080p high definition versions of each film. So expect yet another massive reissue campaign within the next three years or so to capitalize on the next generation optical disc format. Currently, there exists a competition between Sony's Blu-ray disc and Toshiba's HD DVD - a market struggle somewhat comparable to the VHS vs. Betamax battle of the early 1980s. To be honest, I don't know how much better the picture can get - with a decent LCD screen and an up-converting DVD player, the average viewer will be more than satisfied with the UE DVDs.

By the end of 2007, each film will be available for individual purchase as a single disc releases with no additional features (except cast and crew commentaries as a secondary audio track). However, the box set bundle is a better deal, from both financial and entertainment perspectives. But if you still need additional convincing (as I did), buy the single disc ""Goldfinger"" for ten bucks - I was sold on the box sets even before the opening titles started.

UPDATE (March 16, 2007): Just purchased a Sony DVPNS75H upscaling DVD player. There are no playback issues like those experienced with the Samsung DVD R-120. In fact, the picture is slightly better. Haven't tried the HDMI link, but the progressive scan output through component cables is beautiful. A word to the wise - any 'defective' discs you have may be just fine, however it could be time to upgrade your player. One more note - the player has this neat screen saver feature which displays a still frame from the menu along with the title of the film when you stop playback (many recent DVDs are encoded with this function).

UPDATE (April 10, 2007): Having watched half the series in chronological order, I finally found a quality issue worth reporting - excessive edge enhancement (artificial image sharpening) during the first half of ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The effect is characterized by the presence of black or white outlines around objects (like a halo), predominantly in medium and long shots. The effect is less obvious during the second half of the film. Thinking that I might have been tired while viewing, I perused endless posts on discussion boards dedicated to the UE DVDs to confirm. It's distracting and disappointing, but the UE is still preferable to the SE. Also worth noting is that the frame is cropped on the transfers of ""A View To A Kill"" and ""Goldeneye."" No integral image data is lost and the average viewer probably won't notice.

Having read all those online threads, I'm amazed over how purists emphatically debate details, but even after digesting such intense scrutinies, I abide by my own evaluation of the UE DVDs - you WILL be impressed.",1172620800,194,8909,5.072354948805461

578457,3,6303118259,"It's taken me nearly twenty-three years to see my first Bond movie. I just haven't been interested in them before. All the hype about Daniel Craig being the next James Bond just turned be right off. But people seem to be determined to get me to see the most hyped films - next it will be Lord Of The Rings! (NO Dad.)

After seeing my first Bond film, yes it was good, but I can take them or leave them. Timothy Dalton? I wasn't so keen on him as Bond. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but my mum seems to have a thing for Roger Moore. I just think Bond should be at least attractive, but I suppose women of a certain age will find Timothy Dalton attractive. Not for me I'm afraid. He also plays a very bitter Bond. I mean, his best friend and his wife of a few hours were just killed, but it's weird to see him so bitter. I've seen bits of Roger Moore, and he's very different to that.

Why I've never seen James Bond movies is probably because they seem to be the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy. The big guns (overcompensating for something?), the fancy gadgets, the cars that they'll never earn enough money to have, and the women who they can only dream about. It's just a bit weird, and it's a bit of a turn off. Every little boy probably wants to be James Bond. It's like the (male) reviewers who go on about the Bond women. But I suppose that could be taken either way.

The best thing about Licence To Kill, was in my opinion, the iguana. It was sooooo cute!

I don't think this was my best film to introduce me to the Bond series, although I could be wrong. It was perfectly enjoyable, and watchable. And for some reason, it probably will stand the test of time.",1168128000,2,1680,4.16
578458,3,6303118259,"In the most serious Bond movie since ""From Russia with Love,"" writer Michael G. Wilson eliminated some of the very elements that have contributed to the longevity of the series--namely, the biting humor, fascinating locations, and a grandiose scheme perpetrated by a fantasy villain... ""Licence to Kill"" was almost a claustrophobic Bond considering its limited and uninteresting trips to Key West and Isthmus City...

Dalton--who is once again serious and on target--should have been lightened up a bit... Audiences who spend two or more hours with Bond need to laugh once in a while... Thankfully, Q, awarded the biggest role of his film career (following a tip-off from an anxious Moneypenny), was on hand to provide some crucial comic relief...

The story was a brave departure from anything previously ventured: shortly after acting as best man at the wedding of Felix Leiter, Bond discovers that Leiter's bride has been murdered and that his friend has been savaged by a shark... With grim determination, 007 launches a personal vendetta against Frank Sanchez, the sadistic drug baron responsible; his obsession sees him stripped of his license to kill by a furious M (Robert Brown).

Robert Davi proved to be an excellent choice for the role of murderous South American drug lord Franz Sanchez... Surrounded by a private army that keeps potential assassins at arm's length, Sanchez was not an easy target... His main associates include corrupt seaman Anthony Zerbe, a drunken pervert and a sadist Benecio Del Toro...

Carey Lowell showed to be the best Bond girl in years... She was delightful as Pam Bouvier, a resourceful, beautiful CIA pilot and undercover operative who helps Bond at every turn...

578459,3,6303118259,"LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. Though interesting there seems to be something offbeat and awry about it.

Dalton's Bond certainly possessed the drive that Connery had, but after seeing Daniel Craig in CASINO ROYALE I see his performance in a different light. Dalton does not posses the intensity or physical presence and that enigmatic quality of the lonely blunt instrument that Daniel Craig has demonstrated. These were qualities that Dalton openly wanted to put into his performance but this film tries to make Dalton a thinking man's superhero man of action. That is a real dichotomy and is a mismatch for the strong histrionic qualities that Dalton processes as an actor.

James Bond resigns in this film, but it had nowhere near the impact as when he offered his resignation in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. The story is supposed to be about Bond's revenge for the mutilation of his friend, Felix Leiter and the death of Leiter's wife. Revenge is usually meant to inflict punishment for a wrong deed received. The wrong received was the emotional pain that Bond was supposed to have experienced at Leiter's misfortunes. Cinematically, there was no visual basis for Bond's emotional pain. We never see the camaraderie or friendship between Leiter and Bond that was supposed to have existed. Why should Bond loose his objectivity and his professionalism over this incident?

Dalton's Bond however, had little time for levity or diversion from the mission at hand. He was the dedicated civil servant. It is not that Dalton could have resigned and gone off on some personal revenge, but the film never lays the foundation for this happening and given Dalton's interpretation of the character, Bond's actions make no sense. For the viewer, revenge would suggest that some degree of emotional anger be felt while watching the film. As a viewer I felt very little anger for the pain and suffering dispensed by Sanchez and his henchmen. Certainly many of their acts were heinous and brutal, but as filmed and edited they did not have the dramatic impact that they should have. I feel that the direction, the editing and screenplay lacked a cohesive vision.

Once Bond breaks into Milton Krest's warehouse in Key West and proceeds to get pulled in by M at the Hemmingway House, the film starts losing what little momentum it had. We see Sharkey's body being towed to Krest's boat, another victim of Sanchez. We never learn under what circumstances he was killed. Bond meets up with Pam Bouvier at the Barrelhead Saloon. Following a poorly staged barroom brawl they join forces and peruse Sanchez to Isthmus City. Several superficial and perfunctory side plots divert the central story line. Banal dialogue, poor casting in key roles and Michael Kamen's unusually lackluster score permeates the entire film. It plods along to what should have been a face-to-face and no-holds-bared confrontation between Bond and Sanchez. This type of confrontation never materializes in the form that it should have.

ond informs Leiter over the phone about his retribution on Sanchez in a very brief and throwaway scene. This should have been a key scene in the film, bringing the revenge to an end. The best element of the story line was the idea of having Bond place doubt in the mind of Sanchez that henchmen in his organization were plotting against him and he didn't know whom to trust. However, this plot device was not exploited till nearly the last third of the film.

LICENCE TO KILL does contain some good performances. The film's greatest asset is Benicio Del Toro's performance as Dario, a Sanchez henchman. Dario's screen presence is twisted and contorted bringing the notion that evil menace is the only reason for his existence in life. Don Stroud was very credible and somewhat likeable as Heller, the head of security and Sanchez's private army. Wayne Newton actually brought a nice touch of comic relief as Professor Joe Butcher, head of a meditation temple and front for Sanchez's laboratories. Anthony Zerbe brought his unique brand of histrionics to his role of the seemingly drunken smuggler Milton Krest. From a sentimental point of view, it was good to see David Hedison reprise his role as Felix Leiter and it was nice to see Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the field in a meatier role than usual. Robert Brown gave his most credible performance as M in this film. Brown never possessed the charisma that Bernard Lee brought to the role. Here Brown as M brings a cold detachment in his scene with Bond even deploying sharpshooters in the event that the rogue agent may attempt to act irrationally when his ""Licence to Kill"" is revoked.

Also this film contains two of the best-staged and edited action scenes from the James Bond series. Bond's single-handed assault on Milton Krest's smuggling boat, which goes above and below water and finally into the air is incredible. The film's finale contains an intricate, complex, enthralling and completely entertaining duel between Bond and Sanchez and his cronies as they drive, jump, hurdle and hang on for dear life onto oil tank trucks along a mountainous curving road while bullets ricochet, rockets fly and explosion abound. The film seems more palatable with the passage of time. Bond was literally living on the edge in this one.",1167955200,,5363,4.952222222222222
578569,4,6303118259,"This 16th entry in the Bond franchise is notable for multiple reasons. It marks many firsts and several lasts, but it's also the darkest and nastiest the series has ever got, and this really appeals to me. I severely doubt that Bond will ever go as wicked and hardcore as Timothy Dalton's second venture.

Second and last for Dalton. Fifth and last for director John Glen. Last for Robert Brown as M. Last for Caroline Bliss as Moneypenny. First and last for composer Michael Kamen. First Bond movie to be given an adult rating (barely escaping an R in the US and cut to get a 15 in the UK). And, most importantly, the very last Bond movie to be released during the summer season. A fact that endures to this day as the studio now favors a late autumn/early winter slot. It also marked the last entry for over six years, the longest gap in the franchise, before Brosnan rebooted the character with Goldeneye.

Summer 1989 was very busy for moviegoers. Tim Burton's Batman, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters 2, and Lethal Weapon 2 were all pulling in huge business. For the kiddies there was lighter fare such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Franchise fatigue had set in with James Bond. The public had endured one movie every two years since 1962 and were looking elsewhere for thrills and adventure. No one cared for a mean and nasty Bond movie. The few who took a chance were turned off by the violence and sadism. Licence to Kill became the dark, very dark, horse of the franchise. If there is one kind of movie I adore above all else, it's the dark horse. This time around Bond goes Bad (with a capital B, you should notice).

The formula of a supervillain surrounded by scantily-clad women out for world domination being thwarted by gadgets and expensive cars is thrown out. Licence to Kill subverts viewer expectations on many levels and gives us an altogether different story for Bond (though perhaps a bit too familiar in regards to other 80s action movies).

After successfully capturing South American drug lord Franz Sanchez (a cool, smoldering performance by Robert Davi) in Miami series spook Felix Leiter (David Hedison, reprising his role from Live and Let Die) ties the knot with lovely wife Della. Sanchez does not plan to stay incarcerated for long and has soon corrupted the man bringing him in for trial. Immediately after being sprung from captivity he murders Della and mutilates Leiter by feeding him to a shark. The sight of a dead woman in her wedding dress opens old wounds for Bond and he relentlessly hunts down Sanchez.

M is having none of this and orders Bond to abandon his quest for vengeance or face the consequences. Bond promptly quits MI6 and goes rogue. In many ways it is Bond who is the villain of this film. As I said, Franz Sanchez is not a cartoon. He's simply a businessman looking to expand his empire. A man who believes in loyalty above all else. Look out for him and he'll look out for you. Bond identifies this crack in the armor and abuses it, squeezing himself into Sanchez's operation and destroying it from within. Sanchez does not have any ridiculous backstory or motivation, he develops as a character as Bond manipulates and exploits him. His confusion and naive sense of friendship the cause of many sad ironies. It's easy to forget that we are supposed to enjoy his downfall as Bond sets about wrecking his dreams and future.

Timothy Dalton absolutely kills it as Bond in LTK. His sharp, focused eyes and his cold, angry performance give us an insight into a whole new side of the character. Here Bond is stripped down, without back-up, with little to no weapons or gadgets, while winging his revenge plot on the fly. This is not the soft, dull-witted Bond of the Moore-era. Dalton is furious. Sanchez finally gives him a much-needed outlet for his pent-up rage over Tracy's death. You could go straight from OHMSS to LTK and completely skip over the silly Moore years altogether.

Thrown into the mix is Carey Lowell as Pam Bouvier, a CIA op with her own agenda against Sanchez. I had the biggest crush on her when I was 9-years-old. Her short hair and tall, slender frame really caught my eye more than Olivia D'Abo or Tanya Roberts. Bouvier is no bimbo either. She's feisty and smart, and the perfect match for Bond. Talisa Soto is also real easy to look at, but her wooden acting spoils it a bit.

John Glen is not much of a visual director, he was really just there to make sure that the cameras were switched on during these years. LTK is shot in lovely anamorphic Panavision with very high key photography. I do feel that the film could have benefited from more atmospheric intriguing camera-work and it sometimes comes close but for the most part this is same-old when it comes to aesthetics, and is the only noticeable similarity it has to the previous movies.

Michael Kamen's score might also sound familiar. It might remind you of Nakatomi Plaza specifically. Kamen's late 80s/early 90s signature is all over this one, which is appropriate since it IS the Die Hard Bond, sharing cast and crew members with the 1988 classic. The sign of a good Bond composer is one who knows when to just go totally crazy with the famous Bond chorus (something no Daniel Craig entry has done yet). The chorus marks the moment when 007 does something ""Totally Bond"". Here it's during the moment he wheelies through a fire in a big rig, the look on his face as he smacks down on top of another car proving that being Bad is so damn Good. Sadly, for some reason, it is the ONLY Bond score that has never had a proper album release.

Do not listen to the killjoys who say that this movie killed the franchise. Dalton did not kill Bond and Brosnan did not save him. Dalton only maxed-out the character and ended years of silliness. He was given a very short tenure as Bond but he managed to take him away from Moore and pushed as far as he could, as far as audiences would let him. If it were not for rights issues he would have got a third outing, but nothing could top this one. He goes for broke and cashes out, but not before leaving a solid, and definite mark on the franchise. LTK is a tough, nose-to-the-grinding block Bond movie that could have been taken a few steps further had Glen had the talent and flair to do so, but as it is this is still a very important entry in an innovating and enduring series.",1167782400,7,6354,4.546328671328672
578570,5,6303118259,"Ok, here's my opinion. The film is absolutely incredible. In fact, it may be the best pre Casino Royale Bond film. On the other hand, the edition annoys a little bit. First of all, we all know what Bond is about, saving the world, using a bunch of gadgets, and wooing a girl or two along the way. This film basically comprises all the elements, and the sexual content was refreshingly GONE from this film. Unfortunately, the DVD makers had to throw in all those stupid ""shadow"" people on the menu, and that really made the experience worse for me. (Do we really need to see that? What does that even have to do with the film?)

I guess in the end though, this was a stellar effort, the acting was wonderful, the action was wonderful, and many of the sequences seemed like they came right out of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

578573,5,6303118259,"""Licence to Kill"" is the 2nd and final outing of Timothy Dalton as James Bond. It's better than his first turn as Bond ""The Living Daylights"" and has some great action sequences, beautiful women, and even some drama. In the opening of the film, Bond's friend Felix (David Fedison) is getting married to Della (Priscilla Barnes). Right before the ceremony, Bond and Felix hear that drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi, an actor you'll recognize from many films. Even though, I can't remember which ones) is nearby and they manage to arrest him; The scene ends with Felix arriving at the chapel, to his overjoyed bride. Problem is, Sanchez has a lot of money and is able to bribe one of the officers to help him in escaping. He exacts his revenge by attacking Felix and Della; With Della dead and Felix in the hospital, Bond resigns from the British Secret Service and goes after Sanchez with a personal vendetta. Aiding him is a beautiful pilot named Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe (Talisa Soto, wife of Benjamin Bratt). A very young Benicio Del Toro turns up as one of Sanchez's henchmen; It was weird seeing Del Toro, because he looks different and his voice is a lot higher compared to his now-raspy voice. A lot of people complain about Dalton's interpretation of Bond, which is a far cry from Connery's (I haven't seen any Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan outings yet, so I have only Connery to compare to). I agree that Connery is the best Bond, but it's not so much in the acting; But the character. Connery's Bond is almost inhuman. He shows almost no real emotion. He loves women, but he's never seen in love with a woman. He's pretty much immortal, always winning in the end. He seems to have no real friends, except Q...But that's just the guy that makes his weapons. In his outings, Dalton makes Bond human. Everything Bond does in this film is for personal satisfaction, he has friends, he shows emotion. A lot of people don't like this, they like Bond to be what they want to be. But, I have to respect Dalton for what he did. If you like the James Bond series, then you'll probably like this film. It's a pretty strong entry in the series.

this film was clearly the best one of the entire lot (with obvious nods to 'goldfinger' and 'tomorrow never dies'), and yes, no offense, but i just couldn't stand roger moore as bond...he was a good 'saint', but he was never bond...(although 'for your eyes only' was very well written, and the only one i can stand watching by him...)...and i think that was dalton's problem a little...the writing (and casting)...he was amazing, and 'licence to kill' was a major step up from 'living daylights' (and still my personal favorite), but, by that point, people had their heart set on pierce...and, even though he was good as well, after 'tomorrow never dies', the scripts certainly died, with some of the worst bond films ever made ('die another day', 'the world is not enough'...give me a break...)...now we'll just have to wait for 'casino royale' to see if we find valor or another victim, as poor george lazenby can so easily atest to...('on her majesty's...' was a very, very good film, despite the fact that bond cried...give him a break already...he did a decent job with a decent script...so there...)

and yes...the new 'collector's boxes' are kinda a shambles, going all over the map with titles, and obvious sets that include some 'good' ones and some 'bad' ones, to kinda even it all out and make you buy them all...

do yourself a favor...just buy this one, and, enjoy it...then, pick up some sean and early pierce if you like, even george...but stay away from roger...he'll just leave you shaken, but definitly not stirred...",1161302400,5,1908,4.740963855421687

If I had just strictly seen the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies like most of my friends, it is doubtful I would have become a Bond fan or at least nearly as big of a Bond fan as I am now. This movie is different.  Bond shows some real emotion in this movie. Bond is upset and angry but still doesn't defeat his adversaries through just anger like a lot of other action movie characters. Bond still uses his intellect to defeat his foes. But the way Bond uses his intellect to defeat his foes is different in this movie than in the other Bond movies. Timothy Dalton is awesome. Maybe the Roger Moore fans wouldn't agree with me on that one. But Dalton is the second best Bond ever (behind the legendary Sean Connery of course). But the distance between Connery and Dalton and the rest of the guys who have played Bond is so great (I hope to see where Daniel Craig ranks in there in a couple months). And to the people who criticize this movie because of its low budget-you guys should watch the Special Features of the Licence To Kill DVD.

Deffinatly check this out, you will not be dissapointed.",1147392000,4,387,4.173333333333333
578578,2,6303118259,"This is not a Fleming Bond or a Fleming film, lets just get that straight because I am very tired of hearing it from the producers at EON and the fans who are kidding themselves.  This James Bond in this kitschy 80's film with the bland title of Licence To Kill would avenge the death of a mere incidental character by impaling the murderer in question in broad daylight.

Poor Timothy Dalton. He was the right age and had the right looks but he never got a chance to get a decent script. Where as The Living Daylights had a unremarkable plot with the correct characterization of Bond, Licence To Kill had a unremarkable plot with a completely idiotic and workman-like Bond. This James Bond no longer is the man about town who worries about his food and drink, he dosen't even drink the vodka martini he orders at one point the film ! No, this secret agent is constantly glowering and selects clothes from the House of Riggs and Murtaw. His anger in this film is just entirely unfounded. He blows off the sercet service to avenge the brutal maiming of Felix Leiter and his recent bride Della; It's a poor motivation and basis for a plot. James Bond, in the novels, is a cold and professional secret agent who knows how to control himself to a degree. He has lost it at times but it's one thing to strangle a man after he's wronged you or others but to quit the service and go on a vendetta ? That is something else entirely. When Leiter was maimed by a shark in Live and Let Die, he took his vengeance on one man and it was done with. When Blofeld killed Bond's wife he didn't quit the service to go off searching for the mad man. Bond tried to keep himself together and tried to move on with his life.

The continuity of Bond's character is also another issue in this film. Writing team Richard Maibaum, who should have been ashamed of himself to help co-write this film, and Michael G. Wilson couldn't decide weather this Bond is exclusively a light hearted hero or just an angry jerk. Take for example the ""Barrelhead Bar"" scene. After a cartoon fight in the bar and complimenting DEA agent Pam Bouvier's heroism with a corny one liner, Bond barks angerly at her about how she was unprofessional moments later. Then in the same scene, while the two were stranded out at sea, he looks at her with hungry eyes and kisses her; It's hilarously bad writing from people who had been with the series for well over twenty years at that point.

Drug Kingpin Franz Sanchez ,played by Robert Davi, is thankfully a strong presence in this film. For the first time in a painfully long time, a Bond villian actually seems like a threat. He dosen't get angry. He very casually threatens his enemies and people he works with his cool demeanor. Also god forbid you are next to something he could hurt you with while he's angry which his hench person Milton Krest and Bond, nearly, did. His motivations aren't all that much though which makes him far less interesting than then Goldfinger's Gold fetish or Doctor No's God complex. Still, Davi has a weight in this film that can be felt and ironically he's enjoying himself a lot more than the sourpuss Bond.

This film has dated considerably over time because of it's one too many ties to the 1980's action films of the era. Composer Michael Kamen, Robert Davi, and other minor characters all made their names having been associated with either Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. The first half of the film looks adkin to something out of Miami Vice on a highed budget though when the location moves to the fictional Ithmus City, things look a lot better. Licence To Kill was an unfortunate end to the Dalton era but I could name far worse Bond films. A guilty pleasure at best.",1142985600,,3705,4.474852071005917
578677,1,6303118259,"1. Timothy Dalton as James Bond: One of my biggest problems with this film and ""The Living Daylights"" is this man playing Bond. He just doesn't cut it: Connery, Moore, and even LAZENBY before him were witty and funny as well as being determined secret agents. Now Timothy Dalton is stiff, cold-blooded, sadistic, and almost evil in this movie and humorless. This man is the worst James Bond to date, he's cold, humorless and doesn't even try to be funny. This is one of my biggest problems with the movie.

2. The Villains (Sanchez, Milton Krest, Killifer, Dario, Heller, Prof. Joe, Truman-Lodge) In this wide-array of henchman, you'd think there would be a plus side. There isn't, these are all the worst villains of all time. Franz Sanchez, measly South American druglord. This is the stereotypical 1980s-cocaine smuggling ""let's kill the druglord"" movie than Bond. They're the worst-written and aren't unique in any way shape or form (like Auric Goldfinger, Max Zorin, Hugo Drax, Alec Trevelyan, Ernst Stavro Blofeld...) larger than life, psychotic, completely unique villains with unique henchman as well! (Oddjob, May Day, Jaws, Xenia Onatopp, Helga Brandt, Irma Bunt) but these villains are average and could be found anywhere (Heller, Truman-Lodge, Dario, and Killifer could be found anywhere, Professor Joe and Krest are a little more interesting but screen time is cut short to the most gruesome death in the Bond series and Joe's screen time is limited as well). Sanchez is my other beef with the film, he's menacing but is merely a small time crook and is not worth going after. I hate him.

3. The plot - Bond's adventures are usually a bit over-the-top and always involve saving the world. Not here. Here we have Bond taking down small time crook Sanchez because he tried to kill Felix Leiter. So, he never had a need to go after Sanchez before but because of Leiter, Dalton gets meaner than he already is and QUITS THE SECRET SERVICE. That's right, quits. In a pointless act of defiance, Bond quits to avenge Leiter and leaves us all not rooting for him or for anybody for the rest of this trainwreck (sorry, I mean film). I'll have to give it to the film, the precredits is mildly exciting but for the rest of the film it's dull-dull-dull. This is meant to be tackled by the US Narcotics Board, not MI6, or the Chinese Narcotics Board (why on earth are the Chinese there in the FIRST PLACE?)

4. The girls - These I actually don't mind (and no, this is not a chauvinistic post on how these women are just lookers). Pam Bouvier is underappreciated (and not the most attractive) because she is probably the most equal to Bond of any woman (because no one saw this film people talk of Wai Lin and putrid Jinx). The woman definitely out-Bond's Bond most of the time, shoots Dario, carries a shotgun, and kicks serious [...] Lupe is okay but I won't waste my time there.

5. The Budget - Probably one of my biggest problems with the film is that I could make it. The money was obviously spent on the precredits sequence.

Dr. No: $1 Million Dollars

A View to a Kill: $30 Million Dollars

Licence to Kill: $12 Dollars

Getting a new Bond to replace putrid Dalton: Priceless

Exactly. This film is so cheap, it's not funny. TLD showed the money onscreen and I could make this movie in my backyard (and I'd get a better cast too). Get this everyone we get a fight scene of course but not just any fight scene... a fight scene in a SLEAZY BAR! Oh, I'm crying by now and I'm sure everyone else is too because we don't get any flashy sports cars in these films, instead we get Tanker Trucks for the finale chase scene/fight scene which seems to go on forever. They really cheaped out with having it being set in South America, getting Bond away from MI6 and using sets from a cancelled FOX TV show. How cheap can you get? Thankfully, next time we'll get a big budget Bond film, the best in the series, GoldenEye.

6. The violence factor - I'm all for action, sometimes bloody deaths, but these are unnecessary. This is the only Bond film to get a 15 over in Europe and it's NOT BOND. Bond has never been the cold-blooded killer type or rugged, ruthless action man. Here are some of the deaths that were UNNECESSARY.

1. The death of Milton Krest: Though unique, this death is probably what earned the film its rating. Sanchez, outraged that Krest is allegedly ripping him off, throws him into a random decompression chamber, cranks up the pressure and cuts the hose so his head can explode. Bloody and unnecessary, plus Sanchez thought that out pretty quickly.

2. The death of Heller: Despite being a crappy villain, Heller is likeable in my eyes and though annoying Bond is right in that Heller is ripping Sanchez off, he pays for it by being impaled on a forklift. Okay, Heller can get impaled on a forklift but what was the use of it randomly driving into the room Pam and Bond were in? It makes no sense.

3. The death of Dario: ""You're dead!"" ""You took the words right outta my mouth!"" Good dialogue there, Pam shoots Dario a few times, causing him to lose his balance and falls into the cocaine shredder, getting his legs chopped to bits in the process and having his mangled flesh and blood fly at the camera. Ewww, gross and unnecessary.

This violence is not needed, plus it isn't very Bond-ish. Bond is not about gruesome deaths, he kills when necessary and I don't believe he enjoys it when Dalton seems to almost enjoy the deaths and here's Heller's little witticism.

Pam: Oh my God! It's Heller!

Bond: (stiff as a plank of wood) Yeah, he came to a dead end. Because ""He got the point"" was already used in Thunderball and it was delivered better by Sean Connery, it worked there so they had to come up with a second-rate ""He got the point"".

So there you have it, a long list of why LTK is one of the worst Bond films ever. With all these negatives, the only thing positive is Q gets a little more screen time and Pam is a good Bond girl.",1142726400,6,5958,4.5274418604651165
578678,5,6303118259,"Yes, believe it or not, Licence to kill is one of the finest Bond films of all. It is quite different from the other entries in the 007 film era.

Times have changed, gone are the bubblegum and comic book fantasies of Roger Moore. Dalton is not one of the best Bonds, but he's definitely a very good actor and his brought more charisma and charme to the role like no one other. Beside the spectacular action scenes in Licence the whole plot is superb. Starting from revoking Bond his Licence to kill by a really angry M going to the funny episode were Q (this time quite friendly to Bond) gives his gadgets away for free and help 007 all along, to the climatic tank chase with Action at his very best.

All in all the behind the scenes material is outstanding and this time you'll trailers, music videos, gallery and so much more.

578679,5,6303118259,"License to Kill

LTK could arguabley called the best James Bond movie ever or the worst

James Bond movie ever, depending on how you look at the James

Bond series as a whole.

Regardless your viewpoint, LTK does the amazing thing of breaking

considerable ground with the character whiles still sticking to the

classic formula.

The good {and there's plenty!!}

1. I don;t think there has ever been as strong or compelling a

performance by a James Bond actor than what Timothy Dalton does in

his second turn as 007. Timothy gives the character a fierceness, resolve and

realism that hasn;t been seen since One Her Majesty's secret service.

The seen where Bond comes across Della's body is amazing in the scope

of emotion. Bond can cry, folks..but the key is that once he's finished crying

he'll go on rampage and take those responsible to hell. Bond is truly

a multi-dimensional character in this movie unlike the caricture that Pierce Brosnan's

Bond has become. In short, Dalton is playing the REAL, James Bond character that Ian Fleming truly intended.

2. Without a doubt the best James Bond Villain in the entire 007 pantheos. Robert Davi {who is

always an amusing actor} creates a villain that is beleivably ruthless, yet strangely likeable.

Sanchez is every bit the match for Bond and proves to be a worthy

quarry for 007 Revenge quest. The scenes between Sanchez and Dalton are explosive in that you

really get a feeling that your are seeing to mutual adversaries.

Davi's Sanchez is a far cry from the ridiculous Charles Grey Blofelt {DAF} or David Pryce';s ""Ted Turner unhinged"" character

in Tomorrow Never Dies.

3. The story is one of the best James Bond stories since For Your Eyes Only. It is a plot that moves very well and

has genuine intrigue. You really get a sense of the ""chase"" between Bond and Sanchez in this film. Every time you think

Bond has gotten the step on Sanchez, something happens to push him even further. The action scenes are wonderfully inventive, yet never seeming

to ridiculous or unrealistic. The action scense also do a great job of following the story rather than stalling it like in previous Bond films.

Check out the teaser intro as well as the sea battle sequence and you'll see what I mean.

4. Suprisingly great music. I purchased the soundtrack before watching the movie and was amazed at the music.

Michael Kamen does a brilliant job of creating a soundtrack worthy of Mr. Barry's best efforts. Glady's Knight's opening theme is suprisingly wonderful

and reminiscent of Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger"". Sadly this will be the last time you will see music this good in a James Bond movie.

The music in the Brosnan movies borders on ""spoofish to almost embarassing.

5. This movies breaks the formula in all the right places.

 Continuity is allowed in this movie for a change. FINALLY, we get a true reference to death of Bond's wife!!

It's almost a shame that for the most part the Bond movies have treated what is a significan moment in the series as nothing more than an triviality.

The movie finally breaks bond from his Secret Service ties and portrays the character for what he really always was..a loner, his own man in essence.

Even gadgetmaster Q gets a welcome increased role and develops a nice sidkick relationship with Bond.

6. The movie for all it's risks, is still pretty much to the formula still.

There are the complementary good girl, bad girl combo.

The gadgets from Q

breathtaking

Gadgets from Q, the customary jovial-yet-sinister biplay betwen Bond and the villain.

We even have the tuxedo and the vodka martini making an appearance {SHAKEN!!..not stirred..}

The Bad

There is really only one true problem with LTK. The movies was definitely made with

a lower budget than the other previous Bond movies. This results in some of these following

annoyances

1. There is a plethora of ""B movie"" character  actors littered all over the place.

I think nearly every character actor from the movie Die Hard is in this movie. This results in

some slightly weak acting performances in some critical parts of the movie.

2. There are very little locales of interest. While Florida Keys and Mexico are of interest, we just don;t get

the travelogue feel that the previous bonds provided.

3. There is an overall ""straight to Video"" action movie feel to the whole movie. At times

you feel like you are watching a better made ""B"" action movie. Thankfully Davi and Dalton's performances prop up the movie in

those moments.

Despite those problems, the movie is truly a cutting edge bond and one of the Bond films that is closer to Flemings novels than most

bond movies.

This movie has done the great duty of following the story line established in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

Something that Diamonds are Forever failed to do.",1137283200,4,4823,4.780339805825243
578680,5,6303118259,"Among the Bond 's film this one possesses a special profile. Bond finds in a true dilemma and moral crossroad. A dangerous drug dealer is caught in a spectacular and hair raising sequence, his pursuit is far to have concluded. The capo evades the long arm of the law, and becomes hunter killing Felix `s wife, in sharp semblance to Bond 's experience in Under his majesty' s secret service and besides leaving to Felix in a true painful state.

Bond decides to assume this fact as a personal affront and decides to follow his own rules. Timothy Dalton returned the original character to Bond after Moore made of Bond a simple cartoon personage.

Kinetic rhythm, unforgettable action sequences and fabulous landscapes, kindle the screen and revitalizes the spirit of this emblematic British Agent. Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto are two exuberant Bond girls; Robert Davi as the Colombian dealer is particularly effective, and John Glenn this veteran director in Bond films behind the camera complete a memorable and well item in this Bond saga.",1130889600,5,1041,4.942857142857143

578682,5,6303118259,"Before reading this review people need to understand one thing above all else. There is a big difference between Ian Flemming's James Bond and the more ""cinematic"" womanizing and gadget laden screen version of James Bond. Now don't get me wrong, I like all of the actors who have portrayed Bond in different ways (even Roger Moore who made Bond a caricature rather than a character). But if you really want to see the big screen version which most closely resembles Flemming's Bond then there is no substitute for TIMOTHY DALTON. And Licence To Kill is perfectly tailored for Dalton's gutsy realistic approach. Just months before his death  Desmond Llewelyn (Q from 63' to 99') was asked his comments about each actor that had portrayed Bond. He was considerate to all but when asked about TD he said ""Timothy Dalton was probably the most real of the James Bonds"". An accurate statement if you've read any of the Flemming novels. The problem (in terms of box office) is that most people haven't read or know much about Flemming's Bond. They only know the cinematic Bond. The over-the-top comic book like character with one-liners readily at his disposal no matter how much danger he's in Bond. And there lies the conflict among some cinema goers about Dalton's Bond. Although it's a tragedy I can understand it to a degree. But it's a shame though. None of the actors who have played Bond came as close to the actual character as Dalton. Dalton's James Bond bleeds, feels vengeance and compassion, and kills with intensity when he feels it is warranted or necessary to complete his mission. He also resents (to a degree) his choice in life as a paid spy/assassin that leaves no room for intimate relationships or family. In other words in the end, Bond IS human. Traits you'll be hard pressed to find in normal quantities from the other 4 Bonds. Simply put Dalton is Flemming's Bond. The Living Daylights (Dalton's first Bond film) grossed more than A View To A Kill worldwide and made virtually the same amount of money in the U.S. as the final Moore outing. LTKill however didn't fare as well. It certainly didn't help matters that it was going up against Batman and the final installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy, or that the marketing campaign was really insufficient, but ultimately I think it was the fact that this version of Bond (moreso than Daylights) was the most authentic screen version of Bond ever seen. And fans (American in particular) were not ready for this. Nor will they probably ever be unfortunately. They want the fantasy Bond who despite being seconds away from death will crack a one-liner and then somehow miraculously escape. As I stated before, in a way I understand why this is the way it is. And I enjoy all of the 4 of the other Bonds for different reasons. But when I want the real Bond I put in a Dalton film. Especially Licence To Kill. In closing I also want to point out that although many people in America believe that Dalton was 2nd choice to Brosnan this is not accurate. Dalton was approached as early as 1969 to play Bond and again was contacted in 1985 after Roger Moore finally hung up his tux but was unable to take the role due to prior committments. Brosan was THEN approached and basically offered the role but couldn't take it due to the fiasco with Remington Steele and his contract. Dalton was then re-approached months later and was able to agree on a 3 picture deal. Of course the media spun it completely differently and made it seem as if Brosnan had been sabotaged (they probably didn't even bother to do any hard research) and thus many American fans felt that Dalton was offered the role because they couldn't find anyone else. This is not true but I suspect it also played a a part in America's mixed reaction to Dalton. I only point all of this out because I constantly read incorrect rants on the internet about how everything went down. For the record I do like Brosnan (as stated above I like all of the Bonds). But no one has captured the true essence of James Bond like Timothy Dalton. Watch LTKill first, then rent The Living Daylights for a bit lighter version of Dalton's Bond (the script for TLDaylights was basically written with the assumption that Moore would return one more time). Dalton is simply the BEST Bond of them all.......... IF you know Flemming's Bond.",1125964800,12,4341,4.65234375
578683,5,6303118259,"With ""OHMSS"" and ""Octopussy,"" I rank ""License to Kill"" in the top tier of Bond films.  I had never thought very much of this film until watching it again recently for the first time in many years.  I was surprised at how good it is.

The plot is based in part on the original ""Live and Let Die"" novel (1954), in which Felix Leiter is fed to a shark and Bond exacts revenge.  This is the most coherently plotted Bond film since ""OHMSS,"" avoiding the labrynthine storytelling of previous entries like ""The Living Daylights"" (which I also like very much).  The action is well choreographed and this is one Bond flick that doesn't overstay its welcome.

Timothy Dalton is superb here: tough, angry, and suave.  He's definitely my favorite Bond, followed closely by George Lazenby, and it's a pity he didn't stay with the role.  He brought new life to a series that was getting old and hackneyed.  Carey Lowell is a particularly luscious Bond girl and gives a fine performance.

This is a gritty, realistic, and engrossing film--the Last Real Bond Movie, in my estimation.  I recommend it highly.",1125360000,6,1091,4.689473684210526
578684,1,6303118259,"Where to begin.  This Bond move didn't even make any money.  Most of the critics gave it a D+ back in 1989.  Dalton as Bond is so lame and boring.  The gadgets and actions is ok, but he looks bored with the role and takes it to serious.  Plus, you get tired of the story lines of drug smuggling.  Leave that to the private eyes, not for secret agents!!!  I think Ian Fleming would have been very disappointed in this film.  I am glad that this was Dalton's last film.  He is better as a dramatic actor.",1124928000,3,502,4.092783505154639
578685,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton returned two years after his successful debut as Bond in ""The Living Daylights"" with his second and final Bond film.  Unfortunately for Dalton the producers decided that Bond's character in this movie was out of character by being out for vengeance rather than Queen and country, and Dalton's role as Bond was at an end.  Unfortunately, it would be six years to the next Bond movie.

The movie begins with the capture of ruthless drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi).  Shortly thereafter we see Felix Leiter (David Hedison) and Della Churchill (Priscilla Barnes) wed.  However, Sanchez escapes from custody and returns to exact his own revenge on Leiter and his new wife.  Bond is the first to discover what Sanchez has done and decides to take action on his own.  It is during this portion of the movie that M (Robert Brown) revokes Bond's license to kill, and Bond is treated as a rogue agent for most of the rest of the movie.

Bond tracks Sanchez and attempts to kill him.  When his attempt is unsuccessful, he inadvertently gains Sanchez's confidence, and continues to work toward finding a way to bring Sanchez to justice.  During his various escapades Bond manages to have Sanchez eliminate one of his own men, steals millions of dollars, and destroys more millions in heroin.

The highlight of this movie is the final scenes involving a huge facility that is the headquarters for Sanchez and a group of escaping tractor-trailers.  The tractor-trailers, provided by Kenworth, perform a series of stunts that I believe remain unique to this movie, including driving on one set of wheels and popping a wheelie.

This DVD is loaded with extras, including two music videos for the opening and closing songs.  The opening song is ""License to Kill,"" sung by Gladys Knight.  The video is very classy and borrows stylistic elements from Bond opening credits.  The closing song is ""If You Asked Me To,"" sung by Patti LaBelle.  The video for this song is merely adequate.

As with most movies, this movie had a number of errors that I can generally forgive.  However, when the air hose is cut on a tractor-trailer the brakes lock on, not fail as shown in the movie.  I find that technical error to be glaring each time I watch this movie.  There are other errors that I am sure were put in to spice up the action.  Electric eels do not generate light when they shock someone, as happened when a guard fell into a tank of eels.  You can barely see some laser beams, and many high-powered lasers are invisible, rather than the bright red beam shown when Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) fires a laser in a hotel room.  Also, you might want to note how $2 million in twenty dollar bills fit into one brief case, which is impossible.

This Bond movie was different in flavor from previous Bond movies.  The violence was elevated to achieve the first PG-13 rating for a Bond film.  Bond shows a weakness not shown in any previous Bond movie.  I was also a little disappointed that Bond was after a drug lord rather than a megalomaniac.  Drug dealers have always seemed to me to be below Bond.  However, I did not get to make that choice.

With all the weaknesses in Bond's character and in the film, I enjoy this movie.  The pacing is steady and quick.  A viewer can only spot most of the implausibilities by watching the movie multiple times.  The end chase scene with the tanker trucks is a joy to watch again and again.  I think it is unfortunate that Timothy Dalton was not permitted to appear in another Bond movie, because he brought a powerful and unique interpretation to Bond, making Bond his own.",1118188800,5,3608,4.646129541864139

The opening of this film with Bond (Best Man) and his friend (Groom) floating down by parachute to a wedding, followed by Gladys Knight singing the title song IS my favorite part of this movie.

I enjoyed watching Timothy's Bond because he didn't seem to be as womanizing as the others were/are, making him a LOT more irressitible!

The Bond plots are always exciting, but my overall opinion is this movie was more about the 'inner' Bond as a person and not the agent, and I liked getting to know him better.

Although it is a dark movie, it is a good bond movie.

It has the things you expect in a bond-film.
It may not have the magic you felt with the other Bond-films. (the thing where many fans complain about) That the film maybe misses, but the action, the girls, the locations, the villans, the excitement is still there.
It also is a strong story to make a good film of:
Bond's friend Felix Leither is badly hurt (in both a physical and emotional way) by the drug Lord Sanchez (Robert Davi in an excelent villan role). Bond wants revenge for his friend and goes after Sanchez, having to give up his licence to kill.

With strong characters, good action, great locations, and Timothy Dalton as a good hard-egd Bond, Licence to Kill is another great Bond-adventure to experience.",1115078400,5,862,4.519230769230769
578768,5,6303118259,"Many people look at Timothy Daltin and say that he was not right for the part, that he is the worst Bond in the series. I disagree, I think anybody who realy knows Bond, the book, and movies, would truly be able to see what Daltin brought to the series. IN my oppinion if you want to see the worse man to take on the series check out the Roger Moore movies that took a lot of respect out of the series with his Looney Toon antics. But I digress. In my oppinon Daltin is tha second best man to play Bond, underneath Connery of course. License to Kill is a great movie in the series.

Let's look at a few things here. Some people have complained about Bonds lack of motivation in this film, but that is simply not true, he has plenty of motiviation, just becaue Lieter was not the big hero in any of the movies does not mean that Bond did not appreciate his friendship. You don't have to save the world to become good friends. Another thing people said is that they can't believe he would leave the service for Lieter and not the death of his wife. Well concerning the death of his wife, that was an excuse to stay in the service since they were already hunting for him.

Now to take the offensive. The acting in this movie is great for a Bond film. Timothy Daltin adds a little bit more of a darker edge to Bond un duplicated by any other actor in the series. Thev villian was able to avoid that slow measured dull tone that many of the villians use in the earliar films, Like Dr. No, and Hugo Draz in Moonraker. Plus this film has a whole lot of Q and who does not love that character. The only problem in this movie is the girl, she's a little annoying and not that great to look at.

Onto the small problems. The dialogue can be a little repetitive and corny somtimes, like the kissing thing, ""Now why don't you wait until you were asked""  ""then why don't you ask me"". and the whole thing about sending the girl and Q home. He has the same little speache about working better alone like 15 times in the movie, leave it alone, we get it. Find a deffinitive moment to use it, use it once, then leave it alone.

That's about all. It is a great movie, one of my favorites after you finish the majority of the Connery movies.

578770,5,6303118259,"An ex-girlfriend told me once that Timothy Dalton is a sexier Bond that Pierce Brosnan.  I wouldn't know.  But I definitely find him more sophisticated that either Brosnan or Roger Moore for the simple fact that he makes Bond human.  Dalton gives the character limitations and vulnerabilities, some not seen since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' others not since the original Fleming novels.  In 'Licence to Kill' he gives a good character portrayal for a good story.

'Licence to Kill' is darker and more serious than most 007's films and is probably why some stray away from it.  But what it demonstrates is that with all the sinister villains Bond has faced over the years, he to can have a sinister side. In 'Licence to Kill' Bond's loyalty is not to England or the free world but to himself and his ego as he runs amok on a bloody vendetta.  And the principal villain (Robert Davi) isn't interested in ruling the world but filling his pockets with drug money.  The difference in motivations is a nice change after years of largely the same song.  The level of action also goes farther than usual, but not too far.  The editing job makes the film appear more violent than it really is.

The script is also more intelligent than usual, as the veteran cliches of sex, gadgets, and improbable stunts are toned down a bit to allow one to concentrate on the characters more, which are really the meat of the film.  No other entry displays Bond quite like this.  His brutality, cryptic expressions, and almost villainous posturing can make one cringe as he lowers himself to his opponents level with one thing in mind;  killing him.  Desmond Llewelyn's Q is given his biggest film role as he returns from the classic comic relief the character had become, now being more significant to the plot.  Carey Lowell, one of two heroines, is a breach from the usual two-dimensional Bond girl.  She's independent, can look out for herself, and looks good while doing it.  The other (Talisa Soto) is a gold digger and a hopelessly naive one, (a tribute to the many women of the series like her I suppose).  The combining of the two provides a unique twist to Bond's always hectic love life.

'Licence to Kill' is not a return to the style and times of the 60's Bond entries when spy-mania was at its height.  Rather it's an example that sometimes, a breach in formula can bring new aspects to a series without destroying the ones on which it was created.  Bottom line, if you enjoy a good action movie, this one can be watched relatively free of guilt.",1108771200,5,2544,4.619153674832962

A somewhat darker Bond film, LICENSE TO KILL features a lot of great action scenes and Bond's relentless manhunt is never boring.  Timothy Dalton is well-suited for this edgier version of Bond, and in fact I have always felt Dalton's portrayal of the master spy was a little underappreciated (I don't really think any of the Bond performers have been bad actors, but for some reason the only ones more-or-less universally accepted have been Connery and Brosnan) and actually a bit closer to the literary Bond than most of the other actors.  Robert Davi is terrific as the despicable Sanchez, and Cary Lowell is a fine Bond girl though her character is a bit underdeveloped.  Unfortunately the script is rather uneven and occasionally undercuts the intended mood.  ""Q"" steps out into the field--and way out of character--in a poor subplot and the corrupt televangelist is a clown.  And if Bond really has gone maverick why doesn't the Service try to do more about it?  They let him off awfully easy.  Regardless, LICENSE TO KILL is a straightforward and entertaining thriller, if not a particularly memorable one.",1106438400,4,1349,4.9118942731277535
578772,4,6303118259,"The whole business with guy getting revenge against schmuck who kills or maims his partner is an action film cliche.  How many times have we seen the rogue cop throw his badge on the captain's desk and go on his own quest for justice?  Sure it's old, but for a Bond film it works coz he's never done it before.  Plus, Felix has been there with Bond since Dr. No., so you almost empathize with Bond.  Bond is pissed this time around, and convincingly so due to Dalton's performance.  Some people really have a bug up their butt about Timothy Dalton as Bond.  It might be a regional thing, but in my neck of the woods, Dalton's not liked at all.  I know he has fans though.  I like all the guys who have played Bond, they all have their strong and weak points.  Dalton is the serious Bond.  You won't find hardly any wisecracks with him like you did with Moore.  Being that he's so serious makes him the perfect choice for this particular film which requires Bond to be a little more emotional than usual.  In License To Kill, Felix Leiter is tortured by a South American drug lord named Sanchez, and his wife is left for dead.  Bond wants Sanchez's head on a platter, but MI6 wants Bond to return to London(Coz ""The Americans will handle it""), but when M doesn't listen to reason, Bond quits and goes after Sanchez alone.  Along the way he's helped by Q, who's on leave.  Naturally he puts the moves on Sanchez's woman as well as another female agent.  This was the first Bond film to get the PG-13 rating.  This was back when the PG-13 rating actually meant something, so the violence is cranked up more than in previous Bond films.  Robert Davi is very good(as usual) as Sanchez.  Wayne Newton has a tiny role as a Peter Popoff-like televangelist crook.  A young Benecio Del Toro is a rather cool henchman called Dario.  And Gladys Knight's opening song is one of the better Bond themes.  All in all a very good Bond film.  The last great Bond film if you ask me coz it was the last to feature the original writers and the original film team that had been involved since the early days.",1106438400,3,2087,4.363636363636363

He really brings across the ruthlessness of the Flemming character brilliantly, and is the only Bond (apart from Sean connery perhaps) who is truly believable as a British agent/assasin.  Unfortunately he is let down by a lower than average film, with lower than average production values, lacking that big-budget feel, although the story itself is intriguing. Despite these short comings, Bond fans should love this for Dalton's performance, if nothing else (the only actor to say the words 'shaken, not stirred' with real venom).",1105315200,3,641,5.028301886792453
578774,4,6303118259,"In the mid-1980s one of the biggest shows on television was Miami Vice with its cool clothes, fast cars and rocking soundtrack. Capitalizing on this wave with great success were movies such as the first Lethal Weapon in 1986. The `war on drugs' petered out following the end of the Reagan administration in 1989 and people turned their attention to other areas. All except the producers of the Bond movies who decided to cash in on a movie craze that had already ended and were subsequently seen to produce a dead turkey to the summer audiences of 1989.

Everything else seemed to work in their favor. There were some big movies also opening that should have guaranteed a healthy life for the picture (the tentpole theory that dictates that a glut of big movies means big business for everyone) and the darker and more gloomy revenge storyline fit the mood of a country post Iran-gate. Yet the movie was a disaster and for the next five years the claim that Timothy Dalton had made during production that it would be the last 007 picture (quoted in the 1989 issue of Bondage) appeared prophetic.

So, what went wrong? First of all we had an umpopular Bond actor in Timothy Dalton. Two years earlier audiences had turned out with a sense of curiosity to check out his first movie (the quite-excellent Cold War thriller The Living Daylights), the producers (as acknowledged by Director John Glen in the ITV Premiere coverage) had to find some reason to lure the audience back other than a new lead actor - and they failed.

Movie audiences wanted a fun Bond movie with a fast pace and more humor (a need understood by producers of the lighter sequel Lethal Weapon 2) and not the dark foreboding tale that was Licence To Kill. They rejected Dalton and turned their back on 007 that summer.

Licence To Kill is too dark and its also joyless. The story itself is okay, and has some interesting points but there is no chemistry between Bond and either of the leading ladies, a distinct lack of humor and Daltons acting feels forced and unconvincing. Robert Davi underplays his drug kingpin role and only Benicio Del Toro is interesting to watch, we even have an unwelcome appearance by Q on the scene (I never thought I would say that) that does not fit the story very well. Its not a bad movie, its just not a very entertaining picture and its easy to see why its message of death and destruction was rejected by movie audiences. Many of those members of the movie-going public interviwed at the time expressed an dislike of Dalton and bemoaned the retirement of Roger Moore four years earlier.

Bond's close friend and associate Felix Leiter (David Hedison) is captured and mutilated, and new bride savagely murdered. Bond resigns from Her Majesty's Secret Service so that he may be avenged on the drug lord who has organized and carried this out-Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi).

It is rather flat, in it's portrayal, as are many of the post Cold war Bonds where bond is simply battling petty drug lords, rather than international totalitarian outfits dedicated to world domination-although Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnin blessedly bucked this trend, by pitting bond against vicious North Koreans.

Robert Davi plays the role of a villain beautifully and could just as easily play a cold-blooded Palestinian terror-lord.

Benicio del Toro as the brutal Dario likewise would make a perfect Palestinian terrorist who murders children, as Palestinian terrorists frequently do.

True to form, this bond movie gives us two drop-dead gorgeous women,

Carey Lowell as pilot Pam Bouvier, and Talisa Soto as Sanchez terrorized girlfriend, Lupe Lamora.

Near the beginning a terrified Lupe is caught in a compromising situation , nude , and is cruelly threatened and whipped by Sanchez , making you long for this damsel in distress to be rescued.

Although Dalton never seemed to fit into the Bond role, the fault in this film is entirely with the script and the director. With this film it seems as if the Bond franchise finally ran out of good stories to write.

 Although the story of revenge against a fellow agent's murderer is good, the antagonist being a drug lord just drags the movie down. Moore's ""Live and Let Die"" was a similar problem. The villains in those movies just don't seem to be on the level of SPECTER and Blofeld, a Stromberg, Goldfinger, or Drax; they are, after all, just measely drug dealers.

It was exciting and yes, violent, but it did reinstill some much-needed reality back into the series.  With Moore, everything - from plot to dame to prize - was a joke.

I watched the rest of Bond movies later, but The Living Daylights had more magic than any other movie.  Timothy Dalton's second movie as Bond was Licence to Kill, released in the summer of 1989.  I was seven years old when I saw Licence to Kill in the theatres back then and it seems like yesterday.  Dalton's second Bond film is not as good as his first effort for a number of reasons.  John Barry(the man reponsible for making the Great music of Bond for the last 24 years)left and Michael Kamen does not mesh well with Bond.  Also, the only interesting characters are the villian(Robert Davi) and Bond(Timothy Dalton).  It is good that Q has a big role in this entry though.  Timothy Dalton is the man who should be appreciated more by fans.  His movies had originality which no other actor can say.  Patti Labelle's song in the end credits is Great and makes me wish Licence to Kill was even longer than it was.  I HATE that Dalton left after this movie because he would have been GREAT in Goldeneye and blows Pierce, Sean, Roger, and George OUT OF THE WATER!!",1076544000,11,1209,4.420814479638009
578890,3,6303118259,"While ""Licence to Kill"" paled in comparison to previous Bond movies, Timothy Dalton at least deserved high praise for having the integrity to portray Bond on his own terms. Instead, he was wrongfully penalized by critics and Bond fans alike for imbuing a one-dimensional cinematic character with a depth of humanity and realism, an artistic move that presumably doomed Dalton's second, and final, 1989 Bond film at the box office.
 The DVD version reveals a lot of what Dalton had to work with during the film's troubled production: budgetary constraints, a screenplay written under the duress of a screenwriter's strike and the relocation of the cast and crew away from Pinewood Studios.
 Yet what the DVD doesn't show of the film's problems is clearly evident in the movie itself. Poor editing, underwritten scenes and the atrocious acting of supporting player Talisa Soto (in one unintentionally hilarious moment) also contributed to the film's downfall.
 Another drawback is the failure to explore, or develop, the potential subtheme of an angry man driven to avenge the brutal maiming of his best friend who is widowed on his wedding day ---the same way he was many years before.
Among the film's major strengths are the performances by veteran character actor Robert Davi as the evil drug lord and a young-looking Benicio Del Toro, who showed early promise in his supporting role as a minor-league henchman.
 What's especially telling about ""Licence to Kill,"" and of Dalton's previous Bond movie, ""The Living Daylights,"" is how closely they remain rooted in reality and strayed from the bombastic, larger-than-life inanities audiences have come to expect of most Bond films. Whether such an approach is a good thing depends on one's own judgment.
 So keep in mind that while Dalton's grity take on 007 wasn't everyone's preference after having been accustomed to 15 years of Roger Moore's glib insouciance, his portrayal was undeniably closer to Ian Fleming's vision of what Bond is like: an emotionally-wounded, existential loner who hates the only job he is really good at.
 But, then again, in an age when producers have to choose between fostering artistic integrity or commercial expediency in the movies they make, guess which wins? Undemanding moviegoers usually get what they want, and in the case of James Bond, they largely dictate the course he will take.
 As a result, the cinematic James Bond is, as mentioned before, a one-dimensional character, who requires a one-dimensional actor to portray him --- which explains why Pierce Brosnan is so successful in the role.",1074902400,13,2585,5.140476190476191
578891,4,6303118259,"The only thing wrong with the 16th official James Bond movie (other than a dull, generic title) is that it doesn't always feel like a Bond adventure. With Timothy Dalton returning for his second and final shot at the role, but still working to win over an audience accustomed to Roger Moore, he could have benefited from the appearance of some established series regulars. But with Bernard Lee (M) dead, and Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny) forcibly retired, all Dalton has is Desmond Llewelyn as Q. And the soundtrack to his adventure comes courtesy of composer Michael Kamen when the film might have had been more ""Bondian"" with John Barry's trademark sound.

Filming in Mexico instead of at Pinewood studios also makes this look like a rogue production, but with Bond embarking on a personal vendetta in this film, ""rogue"" is the apt description of 007 in this tough, gritty thriller, the first Bond film to earn an R rating. He's out to avenge the maiming of CIA ally Felix Leiter, played, as he was in ""Live and Let Die,"" by David Hedison, the only actor ever invited to reprise the role first given life by Jack Lord in ""Dr. No.""

For those who like their Bond bad guys larger than life, ala Goldfinger, Robert Davi may be a disappointment. Davi's Sanchez is merely a drug dealer, a big time drug dealer to be sure, but he's small potatoes compared to the usual Bond adversary bent on world domination. But Davi makes a splendid foe for those who prefer the more down to earth realism that the series pretty much abandoned after ""From Russia With Love."" Bond babes Carrie Lowell and Tarisa Soto are splendid, too.

Like ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" twenty years earlier, ""Licence To Kill"" strays from the 007 formula and proves there's considerable life in this series when the producers dare to shake-off the complacency of success. This is one of Bond's best.

578892,5,6303118259,"If you enjoyed the first few James Bond films with Sean Connery (before the franchise turned into a campy parody of itself), then you'll like this one. Although it's not based on any of Ian Fleming's original stories, it captures their feel better than anything since _From Russia With Love_.

Timothy Dalton's steely Bond is arguably the closest to date to Fleming's original vision for the MI6 secret agent (not 'spy', please). He's as tough and lean as Connery ever was, and he brings something of Connery's lupine charm to the role.

The rest of the movie is extremely well done. Robert Davi is one of the best villains since Goldfinger, and surely one of the most realistic in the entire series. Carey Lowell, though mostly effective, is a little underwhelming in the acting department. And the plot -- lifted at least partly from Fleming's _Live and Let Die_ (which is the source for the bad thing that happens to Felix Leiter early in the film) -- gives Dalton's Bond an excuse to seethe with volcanic fury and go off seeking vengeance.

If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), this is also the last script to which longtime Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum contributed. (He died not long after this film was produced.)

I like Pierce Brosnan in the role, and I'd like him better if he got better movies to do; _Goldeneye_ has probably been his best so far. But for some reason, the screenwriters don't want to make him gritty enough. (And by the time they tried with Roger Moore -- in the excellent _For Your Eyes Only_ -- it was far too late.)

I also like _The Living Daylights_. But when I want to watch a non-Connery Bond film, this is the one I pick most often.

Is he entertaining to watch compare to the other Bonds? NO WAY!!!  Maybe movie viewers expect 007 to be entertaining but Roger Moore had gone overboard by making a mockery with the 007 character which is a disgrace...because he doesn't seem too bright with spy work and is more of a womanizer who looks forwards to making funny remarks as the situation presents itself.

 After saving the world from World War III in 1987's The Living Daylights, Bond needed a break. I don't blame him. After saving the world from global disaster in 1979's Moonraker, he needed his break in 1981's For Your Eyes Only.
 In this alternate version of Scarface meets The Man with the Golden Gun, James Bond (Timothy Dalton) wages a one man war against a ruthless druglord, Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi). The girls are steaming hot, the action is a little bit less deadly from what we saw on The Living Daylights. Of course, the action in the finale is nowhere to be found anymore now Bronsan became Bond.
 I personally consider Timothy Dalton to be the closest to recreating the Bond that Connery invented. Roger Moore was too happy-go-lucky, Pierce Bronsan is a mix between a happy Moore and a timid Connery. In this adventure, Dalton taps into his darker, grittier edge.

One, james bond has always been a fantasy movie with maniacs tryin to take over the world or something to that affect, but in this one he's wants revenge.  Now thats all good, if only the people who he wanted revenge on were NOT drug dealers.

When an international drug dealer kills Bond's best freind's wife and almost kills his best friend, Bond goes renegade and goes to search vengeance. This movie shows Bond not only fighting the bad guys, but also fighting guys from his own side!

Felix finally gets what Fleming gave him in Dr No.  Great story and action.  Carey Lowell ... Pam Bouvier  the future lawyer on the hit tv show Law and Order was a great bond girl.  Timothy Dalton was the actor closest to what I imaged Flemings James bond was like.  I wish he had made more, but if he had, we would not have gotten Brosnan.

578969,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton's second outing as 007 in 1989's Licence to Kill is Bond at its grittiest.  This Bond flick ventures off into unchartered territory as Licence to Kill reveals the dark, sinister side of Bond, in its truest and ugliest form and not to mention, the gruesome violence, hence the sixteenth Bond movie is also the very first PG-13 (almost Rated R had the scenes not been trimmed) rated movie in the series, continuing onto the most recent Die Another Day, although Brosnan's tenure does not boast a whole lot of gore.  With Dalton at the helm, he is the perfect Bond to be involved in such a radical undertaking.
The movie starts off with a bang.  Bond dramatically captures a Mexican drug lord, Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) along with his running buddy, Felix Leiter (David Hedison) on the latter's wedding day.  In heroic fashion, Bond and Leiter make it to the wedding on time via parachute before the pre-title sequence, with Gladys Knight singing the theme song.  In the meantime, Sanchez bribes one of the DEA's agents to free him and he makes the most out of his newly granted freedom, by murdering Leiter's wife and by mutilating Leiter, as he was literally tossed to the sharks.  When Bond discovers that his best friend was nearly eliminated, 007 is out to seek revenge.  Undeterred, Bond refuses to work on his next mission assigned by M and he resigns from the British secret service and in turn, his license to kill has been revoked.  From that point on, the film fizzles as Bond tags along with an informer and sexy helicopter pilot, Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell of Law and Order fame) and Sanchez's voluptuous girlfriend, Lupe Lamora (Talisa Soto), in order to work for Sanchez and to kill him eventually.  Even Q (the late Desmond Llewelyn) joins in to help the rogue Bond, with a rather major role in doing so.
Licence to Kill is a moody, serious caper, with Dalton turning in a highly emotional, outstanding performance.  The Bond girls, Lowell and Soto tend to drag in this film and they drag the film, overall.  Robert Davi is great in portraying Sanchez, who is not exactly a bad man, but an amoral man, and that's where his villainy hails.  Benicio del Toro is awesome as the psychotic, trash-talking Dario and his performance makes the viewer want him to die in such a bad way.  And of course, who could forget Professor Joe Butcher, played by Wayne Newton, the new-age levitation televangelist who is a frontman to Sanchez's smuggling operation and provides much-needed comic relief as well.  Bless your heart!  As for the plot, it starts out with promise, but the rising action in between Bond's resignation and the climax tends to drag.  As for the action sequences, they are good, but not great and could do better.  However, the Mexican desert tanker chase makes up for all the film's shortcomings.  All in all, Licence to Kill is not your father's or grandfather's typical Bond movie in the sense that it is unnerving and unique, but it delivers as a mighty fine edition of Bond. 3.5 Stars.",1055376000,8,3025,4.707779886148008
579040,4,6303118259,"This may have been the least successful movie in the franchise, but it was still good. This movie got a luke warm reception... by Bond standards, , but it still turned a steady profit, was seen by millions of people worldwide, and did much better than many mainstream hits could ever dream of doing. While its PROPORTED box office ""failure"" played a role in the Bond series' 6 year hiatis there were a lot of other things that led to it. The tragic loss of veteran screenwriter Richard Maibaum, as well as a heated legal battle over who had the rights to the Bond franchise delayed the 17th installment in the series all the way up until 1995. As for the popular belief that Dalton was fired? Not true. He quit. Had all gone according to plan, he would have starred in his third in 1991 or 1992. He could have reprised his role as 007 in Goldeneye, but shocked fans by declining to do so. I personally believe that Timothy Dalton did an excellent job as Bond. He was offered the part in OHMSS in 1969, but declined the role because he feared he was too young (He was in his early-mid twenties then) He didn't get a chance to play James Bond for another 18 years, and even then his stint was short lived. He had great potential, but never got the opportunity to establish himself, and it didn't help that his movies had two of the worst theme songs. If I were him, I would have stuck around throughout the nineties, until ""The World is Not Enough."" Look at the average customer rating. Now compare it with other Bond films, such as ""World is not Enough"" ""Moonraker"" ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" ""Live and Let Die"" or ""Never Say Never Again."" This review was not written in the best of moods, but I based it mainly on fact, and I stand by all of my comments.

579042,2,6303118259,"This is the most un-James Bondesque plot of all the James Bond films.  Having a drug dealer as the villain simply isn't sinister enough for my taste.  Whatever happened to madmen trying to take over the world and nuke cities?  Whatever happened to stealing secrets from the Soviets?  (Oh, yeah, there aren't any Soviets any longer....)
The leader of a drug cartel would be much more at home being the adversary in a Dirty Harry movie than a Bond movie.  It just doesn't ""fit"" in with the latter.  On the Bond scale of villains, a drug dealer ranks maybe 2 steps above a pickpocket.  In other words, not worth the time of a British secret agent.
Beyond the plot, this film contains the single most unbelievable incident in all of Bond history.  The film plays off on the Bond motif of having one of the good guys be fed to a shark.  That's all fine and well.  However, after being bit in half, the poor fellow is still alive hours later.  I'm no doctor, but I'm fairly certain that anyone who has their leg bit off by a shark will bleed to death in minutes.  Any medical personnel who happen to be reading this may feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  I also rather doubt the bad guys who fed him to the shark would be kind enough to patch him up & stop his bleeding.  After all, I think that's why they call them bad guys?
Of all the Bond movies I've seen (and I've seen them all!), this one has the least Bond ""feel"" to it.  The screenplay seems patched together & the film never really achieves a nice flow.  Some of the dialogue is pretty lame as well, such as when the drug dealer's girlfriend spontaneously starts crying and blurts out ""Oh, I love James SO much!""  Please.
This is the most forgettable of all Bond films.  It is not the worst Bond, as that distinction was earned by MOONRAKER.  I first saw LICENSE TO KILL way back in 1990, shortly after it came out on video.  After seeing it again, I can now remember why I couldn't remember anything about it.  It's simply not worth the effort.",1047168000,9,2003,4.316353887399464
579043,1,6303118259,"Okay, let's make this one as painless as possible.  Timothy Dalton is not my idea of Bond - James Bond.  On the heels of Connery and Moore how could he hope to live up to expectations.  Well, he didn't and as a result, only made two films as England's most revered secret agent.  This time out he's chasing after a drug dealer (isn't this beneath him) and is aided by Cary Lowel (of Law & Order fame) and Las Vegas favorite (Wayne Newton) playing a high class hack peddling religion.  Long story short - the script is so bad that if the film didn't have Bond it would have tanked at the box office.  As it stands, it didn't exactly cut a financial swath.
MGM/UA's DVD doesn't do the film any favors.  Aliasing, digital compression artifacts, fine detail shimmering and edge enhancement are all abundantly present making for an even greater disappointment of this already bad film.  The sound has been mixed to 5.1 but it's a feeble mix that sounds more like a 2.0 surround than genuine Dolby Digital.  Extras are plentiful and interesting.  Menu design is outstanding.  MGM - please!!! - more effort on the remastering of your prints.  I really don't care about menu design! BOTTOM LINE: Wasn't worth it at the show.  Definitely not worth it on DVD.",1047081600,3,1249,4.572072072072072

The grittiness of this movie is a slight turn off. It also hurts Felix whom is one of my favorite charactors( this was taken from one of the books where the exact same thing happens when he gets mamed by a shark). All in all the all out action scenes make up for the script.,1046044800,,413,4.3076923076923075

Later that night Felix is about to really enjoy his wedding day when the Drug lord kidnaps him and kills his wife. Felix is then tortured and left for dead but Bond finds him and vows revenge.
Timothy Dalton stars as Bond for the second time and is great. He shows all the emotions like anger and sadness to love and happiness. The film is the only Bond movie to date to recieve a 15 certificate and when you watch the movie you will know why, some of the scenes have graphic content.
The bond girls are strong and do not need saving at all. Robert Davi is brilliant as the ruthless and sinister Franz Sanchez. Who believes that ""Loyalty is more important than money"".

It begins with Bond and Felix Leiter taking out Sanchez, a drug dealer, and making it just in time for Felix's wedding. However, Sanchez gets revenge and feeds Felix to a shark and murders his wife. Angry, Bond sets out to avenge his best friend, going against orders from M and losing his license to kill. It's not very cheery and has very few comic moments. The film's biggest problem is that it wants to be taken seriously. Bond movies almost never work when they try to be serious about their situations and this movie proves this point. There are a few moments, like an extended chase scene with semis and off-road vehicles, but much of the movie is too violent to really have that Bond feel. It's a shame Timothy Dalton took a bow after this one. I'm sure his third outing would have been better.",1040169600,2,888,4.487654320987654
579048,5,6303118259,"Licence to Kill is the 16th movie in the James Bond series, the 2nd and last one featuring Timmothy Dalton as 007, and the one fans and the general public usually blame for the 6-year hiatus till GoldenEye. As a result, when current Bond fans watch LTK after hearing this, it becomes easy for them to nitpick the movie and say how horrible it was. On the contrary, LTK is easily one of the strongest and most daring installments in the franchise, and should not be missed.
There are many reasons why LTK did poorly at the box office and the series was on hold for six years. 1989 had a crowded box-office, with such high-profile titles like Batman, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II, and Back to the Future II all gunning for a piece of the pie. Among such company, someone has to lose, and unfortunately it was Licence to Kill. With installments coming out on a near-regular basis since 1962, the public was beginning to take Bond forgranted (in time, this will probably happen again, either with Brosnan or his successors). They probably assumed another installment would come out in two years either way, and they were actually right. Unlike other executive producers, the Broccolis don't let the almighty dollar sign rule their decisions. The franchise had survived worse, such as the Connery/Lazenby changeover and the early Moore years, and they were all set to go ahead with Dalton's 3rd movie for 1991. However, legal issues, coupled with the death of longtime screenplay writer Richard Maibaum, kept setting the movie back. Note that Dalton could've returned for GoldenEye, but voluntarily ended his run. This is the story of LTK that is somehow always skipped over.
Licence to Kill is a great movie. While I don't think every Bond movie should be played as dark as this one, it makes for a refreshing change of pace after the Moore years. The story is simple and focused; here the smaller scope works better than in previous Bond films like ""Live and Let Die."" This is Bond's personal vendetta, and he's taking care of business the old-fashioned way. The villains are threatening yet charismatic; Robert Davi's Sanchez is evil by his actions, yet the viewer can't help but like the guy. Few of the villains in the Moore years (Stromberg, Drax, Kamal Kahn, Zorin) feel as human and developed as Sanchez does. The girls are gorgeous, with Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto each respectively showing the proper amounts of competence and helplessness. The action scenes are great, with Dalton doing many of his own stunts, for added tension. Besides that, Dalton also again puts everything he has into Bond, for another great performance. And finally, Q fans will love his extended role, as he goes out into the field unofficially to slip 007 some more cool gadgets. In fact, the only place where the movie slips is its final resolution; after having his wife killed and his leg ripped off, Felix Lieter looks a little too happy in his hospital bed. It's a blemish on an otherwise great movie, but it's small enough to be overlooked.
As usual, MGM has packed Licence to Kill with tons of features, including their standard (but always great) documentaries, commentaries, trailers, music videos, and other cool stuff. Seeing so many participants in the documentary is a testament to how popular the franchise is and how much fun the stars had making Licence to Kill. Hopefully the background information provided on the movie's proported box office failure will let viewers see the movie in a different light. Licence to Kill is a fresh experience, and should not be passed up.",1039651200,9,3595,4.828200972447326
579049,3,6303118259,"Licence To Kill is one of those Bond films that grows on you. It cribs liberally from Fleming, which is a good thing because Fleming could be one sick puppy when he wanted to. The shark scene BTW is taken verbatim from the novel ""Live and Let Die"". Also note the name of that boat and its captain. They're both from the short story, ""The Hildebrand Rarity"". Well, audiences in 1989 were not expecting the dramatic return of the literary Bond, which Dalton tried his damndest to capture. But it's not a bad film. The pace is quick and there is more character development than in all the Moore years combined. The girls are hot, there are gadgets and Robert Davi as Sanchez is, well, he's great but I wish he was more than just a drug dealer. I mean, how do we go from guys who want to blow up the earth to honest, hard working cocaine dealers?

That said, however, I feel that this film is a fitting ""sequel"" of sorts to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Comparisons are easy to discern: 1) Both have actors whose run as 007 was limited; (2) the story lines reveal a little more personal side of the British super spy; (3) the actor's respective interpretations of the character are somewhat closer in tone to Sir Ian's creation.

579124,5,6303118259,"In the world of Bond as in all things, one can only say, to each his own. Every Bond fan has a favorite and least favorite film, some despise Licence to Kill and most (in this forum at least) seem to love it. I am one of those.
Some of the negative reviews highlight Dalton's seriousness in his portrayal of Bond, in interviews at the time Dalton himself had expressed an interest in having a lot of say in the writing of the film and said portrayal, he was given that opportunity and love it or hate it, this film is a result of Dalton's devotion to Ian Fleming's James Bond.
As far as I've experienced in talking to people about Bond, many of the younger (30 years old and under) people I know prefer Moore's portrayal, they see him as the perfect movie Bond, suave, gadget laden, cool under pressure, always quick with the double entendre and blissfully mysoginistic. Brosnan appeals to them for the same reasons they liked Moore. When watching the Connery films, they found Bond to be almost cruel to women, ruthless and crude. And Dalton they just found to be psychotic. The movies created a language with Connery and Moore, people like that comfort zone and want more of what they believe Bond should reflect: quips, gadgets, stunts and girls.
Then there's the books, Bond is a quiet man, a man of routine, not prone to suffering fools gladly, hates killing, but does so with ruthless efficiency, wants to retire, slightly out of shape, gets joy out of writing self-defense manuals, likes his coffee black, his showers cold and his martinis ""vodka, preferably polish or russian, with a twist of lemon, shaken, not stirred"". Instead of gadgets, he often uses whatever's at hand, tends to ""take"" women as opposed to seducing them, and has no patience for feminism. He's a conservative spy, who dresses well but not flashily. Doesn't wish to draw undue attention to himself, and plays a wicked game of golf with Goldfinger, which lasts some 20 pages in the book.
With that criteria in mind the best bond films would be those of Connery (barely), Lazenby, and Dalton.
It all depends on the way you want to look at it. I find Fleming's Bond more intriguing, but the wacky fantasy spy of the films can be fun, too.",1029283200,9,2214,4.593434343434343

The villain Franz Sanchez is very well portrayed as are his henchmen, Milton Krest and Dario, but the idea of drug-smuggling is just bland and boring. The new Bond girl Pam Bouvier is very nice and certainly lends a well-needed hand to 007. Gladys Knight performs a top-notch thriller of a song that has to suave touch that the film needed. Luckily Q is on hand to bring along some humor in his biggest performance in any of the Bond films. This film is good and I have seen it 102 times.",1028419200,,629,4.206611570247934
579126,4,6303118259,"From 1972-1984, millions of people saw a lighthearted Bond, played by Roger Moore.  Children who have probably like this Bond the best because Moore made the Bond films into a comedy.
Dalton played a Bond that was totally different, which is probably why many critics disliked him... some people can't take in change.
Many critics thought that 'Licence to Kill' was a downfall because of the acting of Dalton but I disagree.  It was the violence and the script.  Dalton would have been the best Bond to play this movie.  Sean would have still used his dry wit, Moore wouldn't have been able to be serious, George would have done okay, and Pierce wouldn't have been have able to make the facial expressions that Dalton did so well at.
The movie showed Dalton as a bond who I believe was a near to a breakdown.  We haven't seen a Bond who has nightmares, who nearly cries...
Finally, many viewers have mention that Bond fell for both of the ladies, Lope and Pam.  Again, I disagree.  Whereas the other 4 bonds would have been more than happy to be with Lope that night, Dalton's Bond said, ""I don't think that would work out"".  Dalton was dedicated to Pam, unlike the other Bond's would were not dedicated to any of their ladies (maybe Tracy though!).
I thought the 'The Living Daylights' was better than 'Licence to Kill' but still, the latter had a simple plot, the action was decent, and the actors played their parts superably.
Oh, and some mentions about the 'extras'...
-the inside docamentory is not like the long, detailed one for the TLD. It was made to promote the film.  It only goes for about 10 mins.  But it was alright.
-the stunts about the trucks was rather boring.
-I thought the film clips for 'if you ask me to' and 'licence to kill' are rather cool.
-The advertisements would have shown to the viewers back to when the film was at the movies that the film would be violent.

579127,4,6303118259,"I loved The Living Daylights, and feel that, with this movie, Dalton was, without a doubt, the best replacement for Connery as 007 so far! He had Connery's look, the purposefulness, mixed with a softheartedness when it came to action and the ladies respectively. He was a DEFINITE improvement over the bland, too-pretty Rogie Moore. (I wonder how many Brits made light of that first name!) ""License"" takes an unresolved issue from ""Daylights"": the fact that Bond didn't destroy that opium shipment that the Afghanis were going to ship to the West, and finally does something, as he destroys a major cocaine kingpin's operation in a vendetta to avenge the maiming and death of his friends Felix and Della Leiter. Bond goes undercover, posing pretty much as what he is, a FORMER British agent, after he quits MI6 over his attitude toward the Leiter incident. The villain, Franz Sanchez, in fact, is RESPONSIBLE for the death of Leiter's wife and the mangling of Leiter himself, since Leiter was responsible for Sanchez' capture.
Along the way, Bond runs into an old associate of Felix', played by Carrie Lowell, and together, they work their way into Sanchez' organization, which is fronted by a bogus religious organization and the Bond luck works its magic from there.
This is probably the third best of the Bond movies, along with ""Goldfinger"" and ""Daylights"" and the series lost a good Bond in Dalton, who was actor enough to give the character the dimension it needed after FIFTEEN YEARS of Roger Moore's Matt-Helm-ization of the franchise. In some ways, he was actually better than Connery.",1023148800,5,1594,4.951492537313433
579128,3,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton's second outing as James Bond feels like an expensive T.V pilot rather than a Bond movie, and the unnecessary excess of violence makes it an uneasy entry into the long-running franchise.
The locales, action and gadgets all feel somewhat second-rate compared to the extravagant The Living Daylights (1987), and said action feels laboured and un-involving. That said, it does have good points, there are some good action set-pieces and Dalton is great as Bond, but this one strays too far from the fantastical Bond films fans like and over into a violent world of overkill.",1018051200,,586,5.051546391752577

In Bond 16, Timothy Dalton takes on the role of 007, who I believe was very underrated as the superspy.  Many people put this movie down because it is serious, or Bond isn't working for MI6, but I say change can be good, and in GoldenEye, things go back to the way they were.  The story is about how Bond is chasing a Latin American drug lord who maimed his best friend and killed this guy's wife.  He quits his job and becomes a rogue agent.  But this doesn't prevent the use of cool gadgets because Q follows him and supplies him with a new arsenal of equipment.  This movie does have minor flaws.  One of which is that the story can be a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll understand.

579200,4,6303118259,"Licence to Kill is a thrill-a-minute ride which marks Timothy Dalton's last run as the unstoppable Agent 007. Let's start with the setup and plot of the movie. Agent 007 is taken out of his element. In this adventure, he is not a after a megalomaniacal super-villain with a funny name and plans to destroy or take over the world, but rather, he's after a drug lord who has assaulted his best friend, one Felix Leiter. Alot of people criticize this film as the worst Bond ever, but I feel that's a lie. Here is how it breaks down: people were used to seeing Bond shoot off one-liners and use space age gadgetry to take down villains and they wanted what they were used to. We see Dalton portray Bond with more emotion than any other actor in the series up to that point. We also see the introduction of a new element as well-a love triangle. Bond's romantic feelings for the villain's girl, Lupe, complicate his interest in Pam Bouvier. Bouvier, tremendously portrayed by Carey Lowell, is unlike any other Bond girl. She is not only gorgeous, but can hold her own in a gun fight, she doesn't put up with Bond's chauvenistic ego, and she is without the persona of the dizzy damsel in distress that too many of these types of films have outplayed. Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) is one of the most calm, cool, and collective villains I have seen in the series. Being a drug lord and running a whole country the way he does, he would have to be. Licence to Kill does not rely more on visual spectacle like some of the more popular films of the franchise, but, rather it relies on the dramatic and emotional depth of the characters, including Bond, who is usually just doing his job, and the plot itself. The other stand out element is the music. Michael Kamen made a name for himself with the Lethal Weapon scores he composed with Eric Clapton but his energetic take on the Licence to Kill score totally ties in with what the producers wanted to do with this film and the character, especially in the opening gun barrel sequence. This relates to what Eliot Goldenthal was trying to do with the Batman scores but with no success.  The title track and ending tracks, Licence to Kill and If You Asked Me to, are two of the best songs ever written based on a Bond film. Patti LaBelle and Gladys Knight really showcased their already legendary voices on these particular tracks. I hate that this film received such a bad review from critics and fans alike. It was with this film that the franchise was buried for several years but its sequel, GoldenEye, did not fail to revive the franchise. So, I highly recommend this film to any Bond fan who would like to see Bond in a darker light and not his traditional element.",1013212800,6,2706,4.477732793522267

579202,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton's second and last appearance as super spy James Bond has 007 quitting the secret service and embarking on his own personal vendetta against a powerful Columbian drug dealer, played by Robert Davi.  The film opens with 007 assisting Felix Leiter in the capture of Franz Sanchez(Davi).  Actually, Bond is pretty much solely responsible for the capture but his participation is kept secret, presumably so as not to compromise her majesty's secret service.  Thus, when Sanchez escapes he exacts brutal revenge on Leiter and his new bride Della(in fact Della's death is practically identical to the death of Bond's own wife Tracy - something many viewers didn't pick up on). Enraged, 007 nevertheless maintains his professional cool, manoeuvers his way into Sanchez's empire and begins tearing it apart from the inside.
  Although this James Bond thriller lacks the sophisticated feel of previous entries and the story's rather thin, it remains one of the most strongest films in the series.  The serious tone turned some audiences off but the movie is still loaded with the traditional Bond trappings, including beautiful female companions, incredible stunts and high-powered action scenes(don't miss that tanker truck finale).  The movie's real success comes from the performances of Davi, as the villian who masks his vicious thug persona under a suave appearance, and Dalton especially, for conquering the difficult task of turning 007 into a hateful, vengence-seeking rogue yet remaining a heroic figure whom the audience can't help but root for.",1010707200,6,1561,5.346938775510204

This is Daltons last film and he is superb. Forget the reviews you've read stating that this isn't a Bond film and that the Villan ( a drug baron) is extremely lame, this is a gritty, hard hitting Bond film.
Forget Bond blindly following orders or being on some routine mission, this is Bond out for revenge...and loving it.
Dalton does an excellent job portraying an angry, brooding Bond. The scene where he attempts to kill the drug baron in cold blood is worth the price of the DVD alone.
The only thing this film lacks is a Bond car, although a chase involving several petrol carriers more than makes up for that.
Where Dalton differs from Connery and Moore is humour. There is the odd pithy line, but for the most part Dalton looks extremely angry, and wouldn't you be if a drug baron had murdered your best friends wife and left your friend for dead?

It is definately the most realistic Bond film.

So angry, that he is obsessed with getting him. Dalton is perfect here as Bond, giving a gutsy, gritty, violent performance, with only one thing on his mind - death to Sanchez.
Anyone who doesn't like either Dalton's performance in this movie, or the movie itself, obviously doesn't understand it. The story is great and powerful, the stunts are there for a purpose for once, and the reasons for Bond doing all this is believable.
One last word for people who think this is the worst Bond of all - have you ever seen 'Moonraker'? If so, what is your opionion of that?
For anyone wanting to see a serious, thinking person's Bond, this is it.

579299,4,6303118259,"Licence to Kill is one of the best Bond films. The key to liking it is Dalton. If you really don`t like Dalton you`re not likely to like this so much.  ""Licence"" is virtually the most realistic Bond film and only Dalton could pull off such a performance which is truly remarkable. I won`t bother mentioning the storyline as there are so many reviews. Before I mention the film I`m going to point out why I think Dalton`s the best Bond. He`s very under-rated by people who dislike him. Dalton is the real James Bond. The only thing that Dalton lacks is a natural delivery of puns. His Bond has a great deal of professionalism and sophistication about him. He`s a real man. People who criticise him for being too serious are missing the point. He doesn`t go round with his book of puns like Moore and Brosnan and lets face it, how many of them are funny! Dalton is a real agent/spy. Connery and Dalton are by far the best Bonds. Most people chose Connery because he did more films and he was the first, but I think Dalton edges it for making such an impact in just 2 films. He is also more realistic than Connery. One of Dalton`s best assets is actually his voice. He has a perfect deep voice which can charm women and give him an edge over villains who try to intimidate him. Moore`s voice was too posh and irritating. Brosnan`s isn`t as deep as Dalton`s. Dalton has a good physical presence in fight scenes and is by far the most dangerous Bond. He`s unpredictable. People who criticise him normally say he`s too serious and boring, but when Dalton`s Bond isn`t on duty as it were, he is relaxed and humorous, although you won`t see much of that in this film as it is a much more serious storyline.  ""Licence"" has a strong cast. Cary Lowell is one of the best Bond girls but Lupi is too soppy and irritating. Robert Davi is a great villain as Sanchez. Other good performances go to Felix (David Hedison), Ed Kilifer, Milton Krest and Dario (Benecio del Toro. The film has good action scenes and Dalton`s performance makes it a success. It is different to other films because Bond isn`t on an assignment but his own mission. The story is quite grim but is livened up by Q`s longest spell in a Bond film midway through.  Like some other people say, I think its a great shame Dalton didn`t do any more films. He would have won more fans and really could have been known as the best Bond. His future films wouldn`t have been as serious as ""Licence"" and people would like his Bond more. The Brosnan films are poor compared to the old ones. A lot of fans who dislike Dalton are more casual Bond fans. A lot of die-hard fans would certainly rate Dalton highly. Dalton`s always tagged as the Bond of the books and the one closest to Ian Fleming`s character. I rate Dalton the highest and have never read the books...",989366400,6,2808,4.40655105973025

579303,5,6303118259,"It's sad that Timothy Dalton decided to leave James Bond when he did.  Although he managed not to succumb Lazenby Syndrome (not do one, but two), he still left to early a time and probably had a lot more great performances to give.  I'm sure that his leaving was in agreement with the him as well as the producers, the studio and probably and lot of fans as well, but for those of us who found his performance brilliant, we will look at the series of films to follow this one as a ""could've been but wasn't.""  Although since hindsight is 20/20 I can't image him following this film with the bad succession of films that followed.
What is so great about this film?  Well where can one start.  It dumps all the over the top plots that seemed to weigh down the earlier films and goes for a real world adventure.  Of course the drug story may seem a bit outdated by today's topics of discussion, but that whole plot point is a backdrop for the ""mano y mano"" face off between Bond and Sanchez.  Robert Davi gives a terriffic performance as Sanchez, Bond's drug dealer nemesis and he even brings out a better performance from Dalton as well.
There is also a  nice little Yojimbo/Fistfull of Dollars story integration.  A masterless samurai (Bond) comes into town controlled by criminals (Sanchez and his minions) and begins to undermine their organizations by planting seeds of distrust.  And although he is exposed and punished, he manages to take them all down with him.  No Space stations, stolen nuclear weapons, captured Submarines, or radioactive gold.  Not that those things aren't plausible or uneeded, it's just nice sometimes to be brought back down to earth as it were and given a good story.
And revenge stories are always the best.  Here Sanchez has mutilated Bond's best friend and often times sidekick Felix Leiter (although I think he actually should have died, but then that would have really caused a stir among fans, just my two cents there).  This sends Bond on a crazed voyage to bring down the man who did.  Supporting cast helps out immensly with Q given a lot more stuff to do, Carey Lowell's tough pilot providing some much needed feminism, and even Benecio Del Toro coming out strong in a very early performance.  The only anchors here are Moneypenny, who thankfully doesn't have that much screentime and Talisa Soto, who just doesn't come off as a convincing Bond girl.
A lot of fans dislike this outing due to the grittiness, violence, or just because they hate Timothy Dalton.  But know this Timothy was the closest to Ian Fleming's James Bond.  Flawed, dark, and brooding.  Sean will always be great, Roger will always be the oppositte, and Pierce will always try to be the combination of both but come out looking like Roger's long lost son.  Timothy will be the one who really made it his own.",981936000,9,2819,4.633802816901408
579304,4,6303118259,"In Timothy Dalton's second outing as Bond the intensity was not as good as it was in, The Living Daylights, but it was still entertaining.  The fault in this tale dealt with a more comic book set up, than a tale reality and revenge.  Yes James Bond went after the man who ordered the hit on Felix Lietner and wife but, that's as far as realism went.  Also to say that Dalton embraced the role and made it his own is only partrly correct.  Though he did do a far better job than Roger Moore ever did after, The Man with the Golden Gun, Dalton was bettered by the man who came after.  Still, Licence to Kill, deserves a four star rating.",978912000,,635,4.172131147540983
579305,4,6303118259,"Timothy Dalton's 2nd and final appearance as James Bond finds the famous spy going AWOL from the British Secret Service in search of drug kingpin, Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi), the man responsible for the near death of his American friend, Felix Leiter as well as the death of his new bride.  This Bond film is very different from the rest of the series, in that it shows Bond as more of a renegade than that of a super spy.  Teaming up with an American operative (Carey Lowell), the two work together to destroy Sanchez's organization from the inside out.  People will note that this plot has a very ""Yojimbo,"" ""Fistful Of Dollars,"" ""Last Man Standing,"" quality to it, in that Sanchez befriends Bond, who then makes him suspect all his allies, having him eliminate his own men in the process.
  As in all Bond films, Licence To Kill has some great stunt sequences, notably 007 firing a harpoon gun at a plane and skiing after it on the water without skis.  Also the great tanker truck sequences are amazing.  You have to see a rocket launcher being fired at one to believe it!
  Timothy Dalton will always be remembered as the most serious James Bond.  And although many people criticize him to this day for it, he truly made the part the most real.
  It's also interesting to point out that Licence To Kill had the best scored screenings with test audiences than any other Bond film, yet it failed to find an audience in the US but did do well in the UK.  The original title was Licence Revoked, but United Artists thought Americans wouldn't know what that meant (we're not that ignorant, UA!) so it was changed.
  The DVD version is packed full of extra features including 2 audio commentaries, one with director John Glen, the other with producer Michael G. Wilson.  Although Wilson's is quite informative, John Glen's is the most enjoyable in my opinion.
  You also get the Licence To Kill music video with Gladys Knight, who claims she now would not have done the song because its subject matter involves killing.  And you get the End Credit ""If You Asked Me To"" music video by Patti LaBelle, one of the most popular End Credit Songs for a Bond movie.
  There are also other little goodies such as a still gallery, some publicity footage, a featurette on the exciting stunt footage of the film, and of course, theatrical trailers.
  But one of the best bonuses on the disc is the Inside Licence To Kill Documentary.  You get a real feel of how hard and difficult the film actually was to make, with Cubby Broccoli unable to stay on location because of the heat and the mysterious burning hand seen on one of the still photos of a tanker explosion.  Very cool stuff!
  So, although many dislike it here in the USA, this does not mean the film is not credible and more and more people are discovering today what an actual good film it truly is.

579306,5,6303118259,"As other people have pointed out, ""Licence To Kill"" is perhaps the most grittiest Bond, but it is certaintly a positive quality.  Instead of the days of far-out plots(remember ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" or ""You Only Live Twice?""), here we have a plot that is all about Bond comitted to avenge his longtime friend, Felix Leiter.  The villian, Franz Sanchez, has decent aims: he doesn't want to rule the world, he wants to be a successful, powerful, and rich drug lord.  Fortunately, the part is played by Robert Davi, who plays the role excellently!  The Bond girls here are better than the standard fare.  Carey Lowell is suitable as the CIA operative Pam Bouvier, and Taliso Soto is beautiful as Franz' girlfriend, Lupe.  And ""Q"" fortunately gets lots of playtime in this movie, more than the standard gadgets introduction.
People here praise the action scences of this film, and sadly, I must disagree.  The previous film, ""The Living Daylights,"" had more satisfying action scences.  In LTK, we get 1)A helicopter chasing an airplace in the ""Teaser"" sequence 2) Bond fighting with guards in a marine facility[a short scene and wasn't as exciting as was expected] 3) Bond on an out of control airplane with badguys driving it[Actually, this is a good scence] 4) A brawl in a bar[Nice to try something new for a Bond film, but the actual scene was pretty lame nonetheless] 5) A semi-truck chase at the end[Praised by critics and viewers alike, but if disappointed me!  Oh, a mere truck doing a wheelie to escape flames, and Bond attempting an unbelievable stunt doing a side-wheelie to aviod a missile].  As you can see, I feel the action scences could have been better, but they were acceptable and entertaining for the most part.
The part I really like is where Bond kills the villian Franz.  I won't give it away, but I think it is the best villian death of all the Bond films.  Bond sort of gets the appropriate revenge he deserved, something he didn't get for his wife who was killed by Blofeld in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""
Lastly, Timothy Dalton plays Bond for the second and unfortunately the last time.  None of the other Bonds could have handled the gritty Bond that we see in this film, and Timothy did the best job.  He was a great Bond.  I wish he could have done more.
All in all, ""Licence To Kill"" is a very good Bond, and despite slightly lame action scences, this movie more than did it for me.",977961600,8,2415,4.609813084112149
579307,4,6303118259,"""Licence To Kill"", the sixteen entry in the James Bond series and the second to star Timothy Dalton, appears to have caused more arguments among Bond fans that any other. For the first and only time, James Bond is portrayed as a man so consumed with vengeance, he is willing to throw away everything in order to kill a single man. Only in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is Bond even remotely shown in this light and that vendetta only consumed the first few minutes of the film.
""Licence To Kill"" starts conventionally out enough. Bond is on his way to his friend's, CIA agent Felix Leiter's wedding when Leiter's partners at the DEA call in informing him that a major drug lord, Franz Sanchez, was on a Bahamian island and that he could be captured and arrested. After Leiter and Bond successfully apprehend Sanchez and make it to the altar, all seems well. However, Sanchez has engineered a successful jailbreak and decides to send a warning by killing Leiter's new wife and horribly mutiltating Leiter himself. Bond, angry and frustated at the DEA's unwillingness to pursue Sanchez, goes out on his own and once tracked down by ""M"" and confronted, Bond goes rogue. Helped only by CIA pilot Pam Bouvier, Bond locates Sanchez in a Central American country, but finds killing him a far more complex problem than he imagines for he, the pursuer, is himself pursued. Will Bond destroy Sanchez before he destroys himself?
The casting is strong in this movie. Robert Davi is absolutely smashing as the incredibly cold and sadistic Franz Sanchez. In fact Davi perfected his frightening persona so well that while filming on location, many locals actually mistook him for a local crime boss. Benicio Del Toro is also excellent as Sanchez's psychotic henchman Dario. Carey Lowell plays a strong Pam Bouvier although it is unfortunate Lowell's character sometimes comes off as whiny. Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora (played well by Taliso Soto) is an interesting character, a woman who must use her looks and wiles in order to survive. Anthony Zerbe, Anthony Starke, and Wayne Newton each protray their characters with aplomb. Carolina Bliss, Robert Brown, and Desmond Llewelyn reprise their roles of Miss Moneypenny, ""M"", and ""Q"" and, David Hedison reprises his role as Felix Leiter, the only time an actor has played the role a second time.
The action sequences for ""Licence To Kill"" are also somewhat different from past effort. That standard Bond staple the car chase is missing from this film, in fact the only real chase involved aircraft in the opening sequence. Bond himself engages in only three physical action scenes with the truck convoy sequence by far the longest.
Although the cast and action is solid, it is the screenplay that defines the film. It was a major shock for fans to see James Bond not as an elegant and civilized gentleman spy but rather as a cold blooded, obsessive and vengeful killer, little better than the men he kills. It's ironic that the James Bond Ian Fleming wrote about was a trained killer who strained, not always successfully, to maintain a veneer of sophistication and class and constantly fought to keep from putting personal reasons ahead of his duty to Queen and Country. However, all the movies starring Sean Connery and Roger Moore have completely redefined in the public's mind how Bond should act and while Bond purists seemed to like the new premise, the moviegoers in 1989 by and large did not like the Bond they saw in ""Licence To Kill"". Time has not mellowed the opinions people hold for this film.
The special-edition DVD from MGM has the best print and soundtrack experienced by this reviewer. As is the case with most special editions of the Bond films, the DVD has lots of documentary and promotional material. As far as rating the movie itself, this reviewer was not put off by the film's direction but did not find Dalton's acting as effective as it could be and would have to say that ""The Living Daylights"" was a stronger effort for Timothy Dalton. However, the strength of the supporting cast helps make ""Licence To Kill"" an entertaining movie. So, love or hate it, Bond fans should make this DVD a part of their collections.",969667200,2,4174,4.831005586592179
579388,2,6303118259,"Too much Cubby?  As far as Bond's go, Timothy Dalton had a great dark  portrayl. Originally titled ""License Revoked,"" Producer Cubby  Brocolli-Cauliflower didn't EVER want James Bond to be kicked off the  service. This from the same guy who didn't want his macho hero to cry when  his wife died in ""On her Majesty's Secret Service."" (Poor George  Lazenby!)
Anyway...good concept, but needed a second rewrite. Opening  ""action"" sequence just wasn't thrilling. Motive for revenge--best  friend is mutilated by sharks, his partner and Bond cohort murdered,  newlywedded ex-Three's Company chick killed on wedding night (and was she  sexually assualted?)--all this was building up to a poignant and touching  ending.
What do we get for a payoff?  A healthy-looking Felix (who  seems to have no missing digits from being the main course at a shark  buffet) laughing with James Bond with that ""Oh, you rascal, thanks for  risking your life and career and I'll see you at the next poker night""  attitude.

579390,4,6303118259,"The only James Bond movie I had not seen until fairly recently, ""Licence to Kill"" certainly does count as one of the better  entries in the series. With Timothy Dalton in his second go-round as the  erstwhile British superspy, I did not find this Bond movie as  ""dark"" or as much of a departure from ""formula"" as  others have perceived it. The Bond wit is still there, though it may be a  bit drier and less hokey than usual. Also, any resemblance to ""Miami  Vice"" seems purely incidental and superficial. However, I will concede  that the initial setting in Florida, the drug theme, and the time period  seem rather coincidental, and that there are still some interesting  variations on conventional Bond formula.
In all his various guises,  Bond's C.I.A. pal Felix Leiter (David Hedison) never received so much as a  scratch. This time, however, drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) does the  dubious honor of wreaking terrible vengeance against the recently-married  Leiter for interfering with his operations. This precipitates Bond's own  scheme of revenge against Sanchez and his motley army of minions.
Bond  receives little support for his vendetta, which prompts the revocation of  his licence to kill. He does receive some help from Pam Bouvier (Carey  Lowell), a contact of Leiter's. Although not one who comes immediately to  mind on a short list of the best-known ""Bond women,"" Bouvier  really deserves to be on it. Except when pining for Bond, she is certainly  no victim, and as a nice change of pace ends up having to bail Bond's  tuckus out of danger. Initially sent to fetch Bond from his officially  unsanctioned vendetta, Q (Desmond Llewellyn) ends up playing a more active  role than usual to help him. He and Bouvier develop an interesting  chemistry, mutually flustered by Bond's actions.
""Licence to  Kill"" also draws some parallels between Bond and Sanchez. Both value  loyalty above all else and view money as little more than a disposable  tool, rather than an end in itself. Could this be the most subversive of  the Bond movies, and maybe even the most satirical? Released at the end of  the 1980s, it parodies all that the decade represents. The obnoxious Yuppie  jabbering about the financial solvency of Sanchez's operations pokes fun at  the money-grabbing obsession associated with that time period. (In the end,  though, Sanchez finally concedes to his advice and decides to ""get rid  of the overhead."") Wayne Newton's portrayal of a flamboyant  ""spiritual"" leader also satirizes the televangelists who were  being exposed for their hypocrisy en masse during that  time.
""Licence to Kill"" may not appeal to some Bond purists,  hoping for comedy Germans or Belgians plotting world domination in their  elaborate lairs (which is actually an exaggeration if one looks at the Bond  films as a whole). A drug dealer may seem rather mundane for a Bond  villain, but one imagines that Bond is not always chasing down villains of  the same stature as Blofeld or Goldfinger. Although many Bond movies have  that certain camp appeal, ""Licence to Kill"" provides an  alternative perspective that some 007 fans may wish to examine.",965260800,4,3154,4.996146435452794
579391,3,6303118259,"LICENSE TO KILL is the roughest, toughest and most humorless of any of the James Bond films.  Scenes of unpleasant violence are added and most of the  humor is gone-not that Timothy Dalton was good at saying those fun lines  anyway.  James Bond (Dalton-I think he's okay) is burning for revenge  against Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) a huge Columbian drug kingpin who had  Bond's best friend Felix Lieter fed to the sharks and Felix's wife Della  killed on the eve of their wedding.  With the U.S. unable to help in the  crime and England just uninterested in the case, Bond goes  AWOL and with  some help from an ex army pilot Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell-to join the ranks  of the tough Bond girls, not to mention the Gillian Anderson look alike  club in the first half of the film.) Bond makes his way to Sanchez's home  base down in Mexico to avenge his maimed friend and discovers a huge drug  deal that is about to take place.
There are a few good touches to the  film such as the way our favorite hero is put upon as a nuisance to the  legitimate law enforcers of the world who also are on Sanchez's tail.  My  personal favorite is Bond's camera that transforms into a sniper's rifle.  This movie also contains one of the best closing fight sequences to a Bond  film, where our hero battles Sanchez's drug convoys in the Mexico desert.  The movie might have been a little more fun or better if they had chosen to  keep the humor and lose some of the more hard-edged scenes (yes there are  more.)  Many fans like this movie because it's much closer to the way Ian  Fleming had pictured Bond in the books.  If that's the case, I'll stick  with the movies, for now anyway.",964396800,3,1671,4.407894736842105

579393,2,6303118259,"Dalton's second time as Bond is different than many other Bond films; unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it's better. This is a leaner, meaner Bond film, devoid of humor, and with a truly nasty drug lord as a villain,  well played by Robert Davi. There's also a tough Bond girl (Carey Lowell)  who has to compete for attention with the villain's girl (Talisa Soto). One  thing I couldn't understand: Lowell's character is portrayed as tough and  independent, yet at times, she's whining that she doesn't get enough  attention from ol' James.
The biggest problem is Dalton. Like The Living  Daylights (which is the worst Bond film ever), Dalton is dry, and displays  none of the class, style, or sly humor which Connery, Moore, or even  Brosnan have displayed. This isn't a bad thriller, and the action sequences  are terrific, but I can't say I was sorry that this was Dalton's last turn  as Bond.",963964800,3,900,4.785714285714286

579395,5,6303118259,"It is common knowledge that what works well in the written page doesn't always work well on screen, and viceversa.  Through fifteen outings, the producers behind the Bond series never fully translated the original  essence of Ian Fleming's literary anti-hero.  That is of course, until this  film, 1989's ""Licence To Kill.""  Although not based on a Fleming  novel, this original story is the most realistic Bond movie to date, and  because of it, has triggered a lot of controversy among fans since its  initial release.  I'll  cut to the chase however: the film is excellent,  both as a series entry, and a cinematic achievment.  It is the only one of  the Bond films that seems grounded in the real world.  It has a dirty look  and feel to it.  But that, precisely, is its appeal.  It's dirty, but it's  still Bond.  It's also perhaps the most violent one, but in a gritty,  realistic sense.  The villain, fantastically played by Robert Davi is by  far the most realistic of all Bond villains, and as a result, is  effectively menacing.  Carey Lowell is a phenomenal Bond girl, with a  wonderful sensuality and a lethal touch.  ""Q"" himself gets more  screen time here than in any other Bond adventure.  The action and stunts  are carefully chosen to drive the story along, with mostly memorable  results.  Michael Kamen's score, with its ethnic flavor, successfully  accentuates the film's Latin American settings.  But none of this would be  worth anything without Timothy Dalton's gritty portrayal of a  vengeance-driven 007.  His is an underrated Bond, and so far the closest  one to Fleming's original creation.  There are excellent bonuses in the DVD  in the form of documentaries, commentaries, and still galleries.  For fans  of the Fleming books, this is the one to get.",960768000,7,1780,4.878378378378378
579396,3,6303118259,"It's not that _License to Kill_ is such a bad idea. We can believe that Bond might leave the Service for friendship.  The question mark hanging over the film, though, is whether he would leave the service for the  friendship of Felix Lieter.
Who *is* Felix Leiter to the filmed James  Bond?  Truth is, it wasn't until this movie that an actor actually returned  to play the role-and there had been an almost twenty year gap since the  first time David Hedison played Leiter in _Live and Let Die_.  Felix  Leiter, as important as he was to the literary Bond, was never valued  highly by Cubby Broccoli's film production team.  After Jack Lord demanded  similar pay as Connery in order to return following  _Dr. No_, the  character was never really developed.  Oh sure, the *name* would be  floated around every other film, but the actors varied greatly in physical  type, much less in terms of characterizations.  The filmic Leiter is little  more than a background prop-a way for Bond's license to kill to be extended  onto American soil.
When Bond jumps off the deep end for his wounded  friend, therefore, we're left wondering why.  Nothing in the film series  provides us with so much as one ounce of motivation for the premise of this  movie.  After all, if he didn't leave the service after the death of his  wife, why would he have done so after the death of Leiter's wife?
Worse, this under-motivated vendetta leaves Bond largely in (North)  American waters, which almost drown the Bond mythos.  Maybe these locales  were exotic enough for the filmmakers (indeed, the Special Edition's  secondary voice tracks have the production crew gushing about the  uniqueness of the Mexican shoot), but they're no place for Bond to be on  his own.
To be sure, there are good moments.  Dalton's Bond *is*  closer to the literary Bond than others', and this film gives him a chance  to explore that ""darker"" vision.  ""Q"" receives more  screen time here than in any other Bond.  Pam Bouvier and Robert Davi turn  in the best performances the script allows.  And the pre-title sequence is  one of the series' more imaginative.  But this film could've been pitched  without mentioning Bond's name at all:  South American drug lords take out  a CIA agent and his friend seeks revenge.  Big deal.  Get van Damme to play  the lead and leave Bond out of it.
(DVD notes: This is one of the better  Special Editions, if only because explanations are offered as to what the  filmmakers tried, but largely failed, to accomplish.  There are surprising  revelations throughout the vignette, such as John Glen's admission that  this is ""probably his best"" Bond, and crew stories about  mysterious ghosts swirling around the Mexican desert.  The secondary audio  tracks are particularly interesting, largely devoid of the inane comments  the interviewers sometimes have made on other Special Editions.)",956880000,8,2881,4.875259875259875

How wrong I was, as Timothy Dalton's subsequent dead-in-the-water portrayal of  Bond would prove to be so lacking in charisma that even a die hard fan such  as myself lost faith. In fairness, the plot wasn't bad, but how many times  can the lead say ""You won't help? "". The problem of having Bond  repeat the same line over and over was annoying in both of Dalton's outings  as agent 007, not that it was his fault. What WAS his fault was the endless  over-emoting in scenes that called for subtlety, his ""I'm completely  lost--are we still shooting Jane Eyre?"" delivery and his totally  sexless performances. In ""Licence"", we are treated at least to a  Bond that doesn't camp it up ala Roger Moore. The trade off? Well, he looks  like a bufoon-whoever did that hairdo to him in this film should be made to  pay. Besides the fact that the premise is based on an event that would  never happen in Bond's world-betraying Her Majesty's government to embark  on a personal vendetta (this is based on a pretty lousy book written by  John Gardner, who wrote a bunch of lousy Bond books), the Bond girls are  unappealing and wooden. Only nemesis Robert Davi and a welcome return by  David Hedison as Felix Leiter could put a smile on a fan's face. As a  sacrificial lamb, one can appreciate this misguided attempt to inject some  reality and suspense into the franchise. Lord knows, there was nothing left  of it after a string of truly abyssmal Moore films. Perhaps the Dalton  films were a stepping stone to the delightful Pierce Brosnan fueled films  of the 90's.

Licence to Kill, the better of the two (in my opinion), sends Bond on an  adventure to battle the evil druglord Sanchez, this time for revenge and  not for queen and country.  This is a new and grittier look at the dark  side of Bond and I don't think Connery, Moore, Lazenby, or Brosnan could  have achieved what Dalton did in Licence to Kill.  He is probably the best  Bond actor, next to Connery, to date.  It's also a great action/adventure  movie for anyone, even if they don't like James Bond.

This concept turns Bond into a lone  wolf, although Q and CIA operative Pam Bouvier (the athletic and sexy Corey  Lowell, later on 'Law and Order'), join him in his vendetta.

579554,2,6303118259,"It is absolutely shocking to me how many people love `License to Kill'. This is undoubtedly the WORST James Bond movie of all time excluding the dreadful `Never Say Never Again'. `License to Kill' crosses the line from gritty to ugly and mean spirited. I realize that in the Bond books Felix Leiter does get half eaten by a shark but the movie Bond and the book Bond simply are not the same characters and do not live in the same universe. `Casino Royale' was gritty but this film is brutal to the point that I wanted to take a shower afterwards.

The strange thing is that I enjoyed all the other Bond films by director John Glen who amazingly considers this one his best. In the end `License to Kill' was a box office failure for good reasons. It diverged too far from the formula and was poorly executed. I love Bond films but this is the one I recommend people avoid.

Here is my take on the bad, the good and the ugly

The Bad....

Rather than being timeless as any good Bond movie should be License screams 80's. There is a bar scene that looks like it was torn straight from Roadhouse and the plot seemed like a rip off of the 1986 film Raw Deal which also featured Robert Davi.

This is the second time Bond has fought a drug dealer and no matter how big time they may be they're still just drug dealers.

Pam Bouvier is one of those spunky, plucky 80's women who get tiresome REAL fast. She's also not particularly attractive for a Bond girl.

The movie is ponderous and repetitive and the editing is weird. Sanchez escapes the DEA and INSTANTLY manages to find Felix Leiter on his honeymoon. In one scene Bond is in the hands of some Chinese drug agents when one of Sanchez tanks blows a hole in the wall of the building. The audio cuts for a second and the scene transfers so abruptly that it comes off like a cheap editing job. The film just has the appearance of something done with half an effort.

For some reason they toss in a couple of stinger missiles in order to extend the plot beyond mere drug dealing but Sanchez ends up wasting them both trying to hit Bonds slow moving semi (he misses) and Pam's two-seater plane (he nicks it).

Somehow Bond is able to burn down Sanchez's entire secret base with a small beaker of gasoline despite the fact that guards were instantly on the fire with extinguishers.

License has some of the worst dialogue in the Bond series.

Even the theme song by Gladys Knight stunk.

The Good....

Robert Davi is a great villain. Still, he is just a drug dealer.

The locations in South America are actually quite nice to look at and the quality of the film improves in the second half from the dismal first.

Benicio Del Toro is a good bit of casting although his character is little more than a thug

The climactic scene with the Kenworth trucks is overrated but still fairly well done. It only stands out in comparison to the rest of the film.

The Ugly....

License to Kill is the meanest, ugliest Bond film ever. We get to witness a woman being beaten, Felix Leiters' wife being murdered on her wedding night, Felix Leiter being half eaten by a shark and a man exploding in a pressure chamber. As if that weren't enough Bonds OTHER associate is also killed and MI6 agents inexplicably try to kill Bond when he resigns.",949622400,4,3270,4.385761589403973

The picture quality of the film is  excellent, The music videos however are relatively poor (if the film gets  5/5 for picture the music videos get 3/5) but to be honest I am not  concerned about those. The sound quality is excellent. In short a very good  DVD.",948585600,,810,4.346666666666667
579556,3,6303118259,"First, let me say that I think Timothy Dalton is way underrated.  In my opinion he is one of the best Bond actors. His first appearance as Bond in  The Living Daylights was wonderful (my favorite Bond film of all time!)  Licence to Kill is decent but falls short of being a true Bond film.  I  think that for such a serious actor, the script should be more serious than  LTK's.  Whlie the whole vendetta thing is good, some things don't add up.  Like M, M makes a breif apperance and blows up at Bond, takes his Licence  to kill away and alomst has his shot dead, in less than four minutes!  For  a movie that is trying to be more realistic than preivious Bond adventures,  I find this unprofessional behavior on M's part perplexing.  Also the actor  playing M is way too wimpy, the previous M was a much better actor.  Also,  Sanchez doesn't recognize Bond even though he helps capture him in the  films begining! While the film has several great stunts, the rest of the  movie is predictable overall.  The worst part though, I've saved for last,  Wayne Newton makes a breif cameo as Professor....Joe. The only thing that  saves the last half of the film is the spectacular (though unbelivable)  tanker chase. Overall its not really that bad, but hard core Bond fans may  have a hard time swallowing this bitter pill.  But do your self a favor and  check out The Living Daylights.",947980800,,1381,4.471774193548387
579557,5,6303118259,"I'm a huge James Bond fan and I've watched this one more than any other.  In my opinion Timothy Dalton is very underated as James Bond.  This move actually winds up being the most believable James Bond film to date.  The  plot, villans, and Bond are all in beliveable situations.  Robert Davi  plays drug lord Franz Sanchez who brings on Bond's rage by attacking and  nearly killing long time friend and ally Felix Leiter.  Davi's character  remains in my opinion one of the best Bond vilians of all time.  Everything  you'd expect from Bond with an edge Licence to Kill is one of the best.  The DVD as well as all the Special Edition JB DVD's is jam packed with all  sorts of extra's too.",947808000,,689,4.416
579558,1,6303118259,"""Licence To Kill"" is undoubtably the weakest of the Bond films. It almost delivered the series a fatal blow. LTK makes the same mistake as ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" did 20 years earlier by trying  to resurrect Ian Fleming's original character in an age where hi-tech and  spectacle had become the accepted formula. At least OHMSS was a half-decent  effort considering. As I will say time and time again, Fleming's Bond  should be kept to the novels.
 But this is a minor flaw when compared to  the film's content. No-one expects MI6's top agent to go chasing up  something as mundane as drug dealing (although part of it is a personal  matter: No 1 villain Franz Sanchez almost killed his best friend Felix  Leiter). And even worse is the fact that some of the violence in this film  is so brutal and realistic that LTK is rated 15. Coupled with the fact that  some very gory murders take place - the man's heart is cut out in the  precredits sequence, Felix Leiter is mutilated by a shark (actually from  the novel Live and Let Die), and Milton Krest LITERALLY loses his head  after an *extended* stay in a decompression chamber, you'ld be forgiven for  thinking you were watching a Lethal Weapon film rather than Her Majesty's  favourite secret agent in action.
 The film is weakened even further by  some forgettable supporting characters. Sanchez' girlfriend Lupe Lamora  (Talisa Soto) seems totally out of her depth and she is superfluous to the  plot. Leading lady Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) works well as a CIA agent but  is one of the least attractive Bond girls, and Sanchez's underlings Dario  and Milton Krest don't do that well either: the former is over-the-top and  the latter hasn't enough screentime. Timothy Dalton provides some saving  grace in his second and last appearance as 007, although I always try and  remember him by his performance in the excellent ""The Living  Daylights"" rather than this pile of tosh.
 LTK had the opportunity  to be a classic Bond adventure, and blew it. Big time. Its sheer  sloppiness, vileness, and threadbare nature means that this is the ONLY  Bond film in the official series that manages to be even worse than the  unofficial ""Never Say Never Again"". Luckily, after a 6-year delay  the Bond franchise was back on its feet and Pierce Brosnan provided some  much-needed reinvigoration.",947721600,4,2347,4.816582914572864
579559,5,6303118259,"This was all in all a great 007 film. Okay, maybe it didn't quite follow the usual formula but the plot was very well designed, the criminals were excellent, and in my opinion Timothy Dalton portrayed the 00 agent with  blood-thirsty finesse. There were only two problems I saw with this movie.  First, Talisa Soto as the girlfriend of the primary villain Franz Sanchez  is a complete joke. She has to be one of the least attractive and most  uninteresting Bond girl in the series. Second, Milton Krest, a henchman of  drug lord Franz Sanchez, is not nearly evil enough. He has an important  role in this movie and should act the part!  All in all, this was a  spectacular hit and in my opinion, one of the better ones since  thunderball, goldfinger, and on her majesty's secret service. This movie is  WELL worth watching!",947376000,2,823,4.613793103448276
579560,4,6303118259,"This film was very original (can you say the same for ""The World Is Not Enough"" or ""Tomorrow Never Dies""?), and I enjoyed every moment of it.  Bond, as played by Timothy Dalton, really stayed true to Ian  Fleming's interpretation of Bond. For once (at least since  ""FYEO""), the villain was 3-dimensional and wasn't cartoonish or  trying to take over the world.  A highly underrated Bond film if you ask  me.
The extra features on the DVD were very nice-I enjoyed the  documentaries on the making of the film (which included some very  interesting stories about what went on-look for a picture of what appears  to be a representation of a hand made out of fire coming out of an on-set  explosion-very eerie) , the music videos, trailers, etc. As for the 2  commentaries, however, it appears as if many of the comments (from the  actors and producers, writers, director, etc) are exerpts from interviews  which were done to promote the film when it was originally released (11  years ago)-this is probably true because some of these people are now  deceased.  Regardless of that, this DVD is worth the expense.",947289600,,1108,4.752631578947368
579561,4,6303118259,"I love this Bond film, because the plot is so much  different from the usual.  No mad super criminal is trying to take over the world, or blow it up with nuclear warheads, so it's a big variation from the usual.  Hey,  different is good.
Robert Davi gives a great performance as Franz  Sanchez, one of the most evil, ruthless Bond villians of all time.  His  henchman, Dario, played by Benicio Del Toro, isn't any less evil, and  matches up well with Jaws and Oddjob of earlier Bond films, maybe Dario's  even a little better, because his character is more realistic.
Carey  Lowell is a great Bond girl, because she's a looker as well as a fighter,  and shows up Bond big time in the fight at the Barrelhead Bar.  Gone are  the seductive locales, as this Bond movie takes place mainly in South  America.
I don't particularily care for Milton Krest.  Though being a  villian, I've seen Bob Barker get meaner than him, and besides, he takes  away from the evil generated by Dario and Sanchez.
All in all, this is  a great Bond film, rent it or buy it today.",947203200,,1055,4.40625
579562,5,6303118259,"""Licence To Kill"" is one of the most controversial films in the Bond catalog.  For many, it is too violent (in a realistic way, without the comedic or fantasy elements), and does not feature a ""Bondian""  villian or plot.  For others, however it is a return to the classic Fleming  style, as seen in ""From Russia With Love,"" and ""On Her  Majesty's Secret Service.""

Of all the actors that have played James  Bond, Timothy Dalton provided the most accurate interpretation of Ian  Fleming's character.  That may be a different character than the one that  Sean Connery played, and certainly quite different than the one Roger Moore  played, but Dalton's performance as Bond in ""License To Kill,""  and ""The Living Daylights,"" is the truest to Fleming's novels.

The Special Edition DVD of ""License To Kill"" is quite special  indeed.  A beautiful widescreen picture, crystal clear sound, and a  plethora of special features (like the other Bond special editions)  including theatrical trailers and documentaries on the making of the movie  make it a must have. The film itself also boasts some of the most exciting  action sequences and best character development (what a novel concept!) in  all of the Bond films, and features some crackling dialog.

The problem with this flick is that it isn't really a James Bond movie.  Gone are the exotic locals, the world domination plot and even the  supercool spy himself.  Dalton seems more like a cop than a spy in this  film.  Same for the premise.  Bond's friend dies, so he gets personal.  What is that?  Bond would never get personal.  I think the ""Cop  Flick"" trend of the 1980's got to the writers.",946771200,6,546,4.047169811320755

This film, along with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, had parts in it where  Bond actually became a real person. He had emotions, and his  quest for revenge is because of his love for his friend. The weakest link  has to be Dalton though. He had no personality. He played the Ian Fleming  Bond well, but even Ian's Bond needs a little humor or charm.  Still, it  does have one of the most romantic endings of the series. Cary Lowell makes  one of my favorite Bond girls. "" If you ask me to "" has to be the  best song to appear on the end credits of a Bond film. Watch for the  classic action sequence involving Bond pursuing Sanchez in a Semi-Truck.  Unfortunately, the series has only gotten worse after this film. Brosnan  has even less of a personality than Dalton.

579597,1,6303118259,"Without a doubt the worst Bond movie ever made, for two reasons. The first is that the violence crosses the line from action oriented to gratuitous and disgusting, as we are treated to graphic depictions of the way the  villains dispatch and maim their victims (including one particularly lethal  case of the bends using a recompression chamber). If that were the only  problem I probably could have dealt with it, but far worse is the story  itself. It is what I consider a gross violation of the Bond character, in  which he abandons Mi6 and defies his superiors in pursuit of a personal  vendetta. Although we know James won't hesitate to break the rules when  necessary, he would never throw his entire career away on a quest for  personal revenge. It's no wonder the Bond franchise had to take a seven  year hiatus after this bomb....",944006400,4,839,4.691780821917808
579598,4,6303118259,"Hopefully this new DVD Special Edition will prompt more people to see this film.  Timothy Dalton was fantastic as 007 and it's unfortunate that this was to be his final go-round.  Most of the complaints you'll hear about  LICENCE TO KILL focus on the fact that it is much darker and more bloody  than the other Bonds.  To this I say simply:  it only seems so because we  were so numbed by two decades of Roger Moore as The Dapper Bond.  If  Connery had continued I think the films would eventually have taken a more  intense and brutal turn like this (just look as some of DR. NO or FROM  RUSSIA WITH LOVE).  Anyway, don't be convinced otherwise -- This is one of  the best Bond pictures (certainly the best of the 80s).  Also, it has one  of the best Bond girls of all time:  Cary Lowell as Pam Bouvier.

However, I can  see no reason to give such a great movie any less than 5 stars.  Sean  Connery also delivered memorable performances as Mr. Bond, but the movies  were, and continue to be, ruined by the use of ludicrous action sequences-  which while exciting- rob the movie of any seriousness.  What's the use of  saving the world, if you do it in an entirely unbelievable way?  It's  Cartoonish.  I would rather see Bugs Bunny save the world from the Bond  villians than see most of these over- the- top movies again.

579632,5,6303118259,"Different Bond fans like different things in the Bond movies. Some like the stunts, others the locations or the women.  I like when they stick close to Ian Fleming.  GOLDFINGER and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE take the basic Fleming stories and improve them.  On the audio commentary for the LIVE AND LET DIE DVD, scriptwriter Tom Mankiewicz repeats the company line of Roger Moore being ""closer"" to Fleming's original concept.  Nonsense.  Timothy Dalton's interpretation is the closest to date, and never more so than in LICENCE TO KILL.  Pierce Brosnan has gone on record saying that he would like Bond to be more gritty, realistic, emotional, but Dalton paved the way.  Dalton has been accused of being humorless, but I can't think of another actor in the role who has laughed as much as Dalton has in his two films.  Bond is serious when he should be; the maiming of his friend does not lend itself to wry quips.  Compare Brosnan in TOMORROW NEVER DIES; after Paris, an old flame, is killed, Brosnan's Bond shows real grief and emotion, but then immediately goes into a ridiculous car chase, giving her not a second thought!  I would have enjoyed it, though, had the Bond of this film allowed himself a sly smile when he sees the villain Sanchez is playing right into his hands.
In the US the summer of 1989 saw LICENCE TO KILL come at the tail end of highly anticipated summer fare - INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, STAR TREK V, BATMAN, DO THE RIGHT THING, GHOSTBUSTERS II, and LETHAL WEAPON 2, to name a few.  It did, however, make money in rest of the world.  But KARATE KID III made more money here.  Oh, well...",941241600,11,1617,4.553633217993079

Dalton's  bond is dapper and suave, but he's first and foremost a spy, and he's not  afraid to pick up the sniper rifle or get into a knife fight. Licence to  kill pits Bond against a South American drug lord (the shiek villian at the  time). Bond is looking for revenge after the hoodlums henchmen get at long  time friend Felix and his wife. Robert Davi gives a strong performance as  the rank and file machete weilding antagonist. Initially recieved an 'X'  rating for violent content.

In fact, I'll venture to say that Davi has never  received the recognition he deserves as an actor - ""PERIOD""! I  have always thought that Davi's portrayal of the villain in this film is  extremely believable and refined.  Also, Dalton is at his best in the most  entertaining and exciting of his two outings as Bond.  I do wish he had  been Bond a little bit longer.

579636,4,6303118259,"Maybe I'm a fan of the books, but I always preferred it when Bond was a human figure and not a superhero cartoon character (I'll be polite and not name names, but we know who they are anyway.)
I'll fill you in on the bad  stuff first (the rating should be 4.5 stars):  The acting on the part of  the Bond girls, Talisa Soto in particular.  It's a shame since her part is  significant to the story...
I suppose to say that the movie has a  somewhat cheap look to it.  Well, there were numerous behind-the-scenes  production problems.  It's been said that the Mexico locations look drab.  Well, I can see that viewpoint but I also like to think that a spy is NOT  limited to visiting just posh and visibly-known cities which sparkle with  lights!  Personally, I have no problems with this issue as it is, once  again, somewhat realistic.
The only other dumb aspect are some of the  stunts.  It's unorthodox to get a helicopter to restrain a plane but it's  believable.  But the tanker scene where Bond ""pops a wheelie""  with the truck he has commandeered is a sheer impossibility.  On the other  hand, other Bond movies (especially recent ones) really exterminate  credibility with stunts they pull so I can readily accept the tanker scene  in its entirely.
Now for the great stuff.  The rest of the acting is no  less than brilliant.  Robert Davi packs a punch as the drug kingpin  Sanchez.  Timothy Dalton, as always, proves to be the best Bond ever. Even  Anthony Zerbe as Krest (who has a habit of taking parts where his character  dies by having his head exploded or distorted, see 'Star Trek  Insurrection') pulls his weight.  M, again, is convincing and properly  brings across the tension which was needed when Bond offers his  resignation.  And it's also fun to watch a Moneypenny who isn't tainted by  1990s-style sexually-deprived men (I don't recommend it but go watch  'tomorrow never dies' and you'll instantly hear what I mean.)  In other  words, she's still a sappy romantic character that we all know and love.  And keep an eye out for Dario, Sanchez's main henchman.  He is truly  terrifying and one mean despicable fellow.
I also enjoyed this movie  because Desmond Llewellyn, Q, actually gets to do something for once aside  from telling Bond not to ogle the chicks or to bring back equipment  undamaged (which Bond never does so why restate the request?)
The plot  itself is simple:  Vengeance.  Druglord Sanchez maims Bond's personal  friend (CIA agent Felix Leiter) and murders his newly wed wife.  Bond sets  out for personal revenge.  Bond is doing something most other movies don't:  Using brains and wit over gadgets and stupid jokes or puns to defeat his  villains.  And in this movie, Bond is by far THE best.
With very high  quality writing, overall great acting, and a fairly sturdy plot,  ""Licence to Kill"" is definitely worth viewing and it makes one  wonder what might have been if EON productions didn't throw up that lawsuit  which suspended the movie series...",940118400,7,2995,4.714007782101167
