7277209,3,B00ZFOUMZ4,"This documentary provides a number of interesting fact regarding HR Giger. For example, he did not sketch preliminary drawings on which to base his very complicated and sophisticated work on. His sculptures, airbrush paintings and drawings were all drawn without the benefit of draft works. One also learns the rather unsurprising fact that Giger had a fascinating interest with the morbid from childhood. His father, for example, bought him a human skull as a child and this fascinated him (he even played with it). Giger built a playground of morbid objects as a child that he charged fellow children a fee to visit (and which they were more than willing to pay). He grew up in a strict Catholic family. An important source inspiration for much of the artists work, in his own words, were his dreams. Giger also states that his art has no meaning but was put together the way it was because it looked good. This was much like many artists whose art was simply too heavily read into.

All of these facts are interesting. They are enough to justify, at least in this reviewers opinion, a three star rating and would make the documentary interesting to watch for anyone familiar or interested in Gigers art. However, where the film is weak is weak, is that it just does not put together or all these interesting facts to show us what really drove the artist. We have no idea, after watching the documentary, how the pieces of the puzzle simply fit together. We simply end up having no idea of how things, in general (i.e., his life experiences, contemporary artwork, etc.) inspired him and what gave him the edge that so differentiated him from other contemporaries. This is a terrible shame as many of the questions that go unanswered in the documentary could have (probably) been answered if only they were directly asked by the filmmakers themselves directly of the artist. This is not a documentary made of a dead artist (when it was filmed) but of a live one who gave the filmmakers great and unequaled access. Yet it is as if the proverbial cat had gotten grip of the filmmakers tongues and was preventing them from asking (disgracefully) so many of the questions that should have been asked. This is a critical factor that makes the documentary such as disappointment, particularly given the fact that filming was completed shortly before Giger died. In that sense it is almost a crime.

PS- for those interested in a short retrospective this reviewer highly recommends Taschen publishings Giger, in their Basic Art Series.",1442102400,,2529,4.811494252873564
7277210,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,"I've been familiar with H.R. Giger's work since I was a young man, and have always admired his imagination. The main gripe that I have with this Documentary is that there were no English subtitles, that I know of. Almost everybody in this film spoke German/Schwiizertutsch, so I wasn't fully able to understand the stories and conversations that the characters were speaking of. That was my main and only disappointment. Otherwise, Giger's work speaks for itself.",1442102400,,463,5.105263157894737
7277211,5,B00ZFOUMZ4,I freakin' LOVE this documentary! Just finished watching it for the third time in the last two days. We really get to see a lot of his dark and twisted work here in great detail. I also loved the archival footage showing him creating some of his masterpieces with his trusty airbrush. We also get a nice peek behind the scenes during the production of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. That creature design STILL gives me the heebie-jeebies today. There will never ever be another artist like H.R. Giger in the history of the world. A truly unique soul! Now I wanna visit his museum and bar.,1441843200,6,581,4.542857142857143

7277213,2,B00ZFOUMZ4,"The ""Editorial Reviews"" above describe Giger's work, but say nothing about this film.  Not surprising.

As a fan of Giger's work, I really wanted to like this film, and despite the negative reviews by the critics, went to see it for myself during it's extremely-limited theatrical run.

It's a dreadfully painful ""day in the life"" of sorts, filmed over the final year of Giger's life.  A ""living wake"" for someone who was not dead yet.

At 73, he is in very poor health here, can barely move and barely speaks.  His wife, friends and assistants do almost all of the talking for him.  When he does speak, he reminisces in a rambling manner about past traumas (the death of girlfriend Li back in the 70's) and his parents, but little else.

There is some brief footage of the bar in Switzerland, the interior of which he designed/built, some snippets from years earlier of Giger working on it, a sojourn to a gallery opening and signing in Vienna (with lots of fans gushing praise for Giger), and some very brief clips from other documentaries which began to pique my interest.

The director does almost nothing to follow through on any of it after a few short minutes, returning the audience quickly to a more prolonged focus on the agonizing tedium of Giger's home life.  However, I was amused by the tour of his yard that Giger takes the audience on in his miniature train and it's route past various Giger sculptures.  Unfortunately, moments like this are the rare exception in this film.

DARK STAR does almost nothing to celebrate or show Giger's process or shed light upon his inspirations.

I found myself feeling embarrassed for Giger to be remembered in such a mundane way as DARK STAR portrays him.

Some visual artists are not adept at articulating their thoughts outside of their work.  This was apparently the case with Giger, at least at this late stage of his life, as portrayed throughout this film.  But, I wonder if other documentaries of him portrayed him thus?  Well, if this artist DID speak primarily through his work, your money will be better spent on any of his art books, rather than on the DVD of this film, unless you can pick up a copy for under $3.00 !",1441584000,26,2181,4.623376623376624

7277215,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,"Another solid documentary about guys that worked on the failed Dune project. Giger has a lot more ground to cover than Jodowowksy and it shows because in a lot of ways the documentary feels incomplete in that there's a ton of little details not followed up on. I mean a ton of little details. In that sense, it really emulates his art style but it's extremely frustrating cause I honestly don't know a ton about the guy outside of his work. The film assumes a level of familiarity with him that's probably not common. The biggest issue I have is that the documentary is constantly flattering. It's him surrounded with friends and family constantly praising him. While it's definitely fun, it never gives a complete portrait of anyone and there's some very odd stuff going on in his art that could stand a little more explanation.

Outside of that one issue, it's a solid documentary. The film makers don't interject themselves. They simply let the man present himself as best he can, which it's clear he can't do a ton since he's obviously ill being on the older side of things. It's objective enough in form if not in content.",1457308800,,1127,4.635

7277218,2,B00ZFOUMZ4,"I like Giger's work, and I think that the documentary people really tried hard to cover his life's work BUT, much of it is in Swedish (or some other language that I don't speak).  I tried the subtitles:  Says: ""Person speaking foreign language.""  Um.  Gee, I wouldn't have known.  So be forewarned that you may like the flashback scenes, but don't expect to follow the whole film.  Some of it is in English.",1450828800,,407,4.506849315068493
7277219,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,"H.R Giger Is nothing if not singular. This documentary goes a long way in exploring his work and his iconic vision.

Here's the scoop. This film shows H.R. Giger in his last days as he prepares for an upcoming exhibit. We meet him, his entourage and see the place he's lived in for many a year.

I don't know if Giger is a great artist or just a masterful technician. It seems as though art critics are divided on that point as well, but there is little doubt he's had a sizable impact on the art community. My initial exposure to him was his work for the film ""Alien."" Those sets help put that movie on the map. From that point on I started seeing his art on a number of projects and it just jumps out at you. You see him here, sometimes working, other times interacting with people or just having a meal. But his art is always present. His house is large but it's no sprawling mansion. The rooms are small and packed tight with beat up book shelves that look as though they are ready to fall under the weight of their books. His vinyl records are kept in plastic milk crates stacked high. His art covers every available section of wall or table top. Even his overgrown garden is strewn with various sculptures, fountains and the like. It seems his weapon of choice in an air brush. They show him working with one and the ease and authority with which he performs is astounding. I saw no hesitation in his movements.

On the downside is the depiction, or lack thereof, of his history. I would have liked to know when and where he was born. What schools did he attend. What did his earlier works look like? We get a hint of it here but not enough for my liking. And I found it sad this documentary was made so late in his life. He died shortly after filming was completed. Here we see a man who could barely move his mouth enough to speak. I'm certain a younger Giger would have had much more to say.

The soundtrack is great. It is befitting of the content which shows a lot of his art. The art really makes this whole thing worthwhile.

If you're a Giger fan or just curious, this is well worth your time.",1450310400,,2107,4.2443890274314215
7277220,3,B00ZFOUMZ4,"Aside from his most fervent admirers, most of us were introduced to Hans Rudolf Giger in the 1979 horror-in space classic Alien.  The set designs as well as the various creatures come from the inventive mind of Giger, an artist with various bits of horror, dread, beauty and erotica that permeates his work.  Documentarian Belinda Sallin sets out a few months before his death to explain much of what Giger created and touches on where the ideas come from.  Unfortunately, her approach for most of the time is following the seemingly older than his 73 years, Giger around his small, overly-cluttered house.

Giger, somewhat of a recluse is clearly not in full command of his faculties so much of the interviews are with his current wife and one or two former wives.  In one tender scene, Giger talks about the first love of his life, and model for some of his most famous work, who committed suicide.  When outside the home, we see bits and pieces of Giger being escorted to various functions that feature him and his work.  Hes frail and clearly uncomfortable and so was I for much of the time.  We get to see much of his work but Sallin seems to want to focus on his cluttered cottage and the people around him.  I felt more like an interloper than a viewer wanting to absorb more of his work.  The creative genius deserved a better retrospective.",1449014400,2,1349,4.583333333333333
7277221,5,B00ZFOUMZ4,"Great film. A word about the subtitles.  There are subtitles. I initially was trying to watch this on my mac book.  There were no subtitles.  I turned on the cc ing which did nothing except for when they were speaking English.  I downloaded the latest version of silverlight as instructed.  Very frustrating, read all the help discussions etc.  Felt like i was missing something as there is nothing in the details of the film about it being in a foreign language etc. I then when to my iPhone and downloaded the amazon video app.  For whatever reason I then had all the subtitles when I watched the film on my phone. Hope this helps.  You miss a lot of detail if you don't have the subtitles.",1448755200,2,692,4.436507936507937
7277222,5,B00ZFOUMZ4,I have been a fan of Giger for years and was thrilled to find this. His work had an enormous impact on my work when I was in art school and his delving into dark areas of the mind to reveal what lies there is fantastic. The world lost an amazing jewel when he past. This video does a very good job of presenting his ideas and showing a tangible side to Giger during a difficult time with respect and dignity. Thank you for doing this project and allowing us a view inside this incredible man's life.,1448323200,4,499,4.154639175257732
7277223,1,B00ZFOUMZ4,"We couldn't find a way to turn the english subtitles on. So while we love the subject, we were disappointed with this film.",1448323200,3,123,4.391304347826087
8720017,5,B00ZFOUMZ4,"The first time I watched Dark Star, what stood out was Giger's failing health and the quietness of his surroundings. I didn't re-watch it for a long time, because it felt like a homey visit to a mad scientist's lair as shop was being shut down. The second and third times I watched DS, I felt the beauty Giger paradoxically lived within as he designed his grotesqueries to quell his worst fears. This is one of the most fascinating and absorbing documentaries I've ever seen. Giger and his cat and their family and friends tend to business and go on with life in what may qualify as the world's strangest home. Maybe mystery remains about any occult meaning in the great artist's oeuvre. The ultimate mystery is how one man brought so much futuristic bizarreness to life in art. Much love emanates from this wistful hello and goodbye to a 20th century legend.",1533859200,,859,4.620915032679738

8720020,2,B00ZFOUMZ4,"The moment I saw a trailer for this film I wanted to buy the DVD. I love HR Giger and this seems to be the first documentary (that I am aware of) about his life. Thankfully I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing, and was able to stream this film on Netflix without wasting my money.

The truth is this doc is too little, too late. Giger died prior to the film's release, which gives you an indication about the quality of his life at the time of filming. The poor man is suffering from COPD and no one seems to care as they blatantly smoke around him. Walking, let alone breathing, looks painful for Giger. Whatever life he was known to be full of at some point has clearly faded, and watching his bulbous eyes stare absently as his sycophants gush about him gets uncomfortable to watch after about 20 minutes.

Had someone thought to do a documentary 10 or 20 years earlier might have yielded something substantial. Instead, as he nears the end of his life, we are treated with footage of his mother in law putzing around her cluttered office. We see Giger looking lost as he walks around his home, probably wondering why a camera is following him. It's impossible not to see how aware he and his wife are of the cameras in their bedroom as he stares blankly at the television screen.

I admit, at least we have SOMETHING recorded for posterity, and for that I am grateful. But there is not enough in here to warrant a feature-length film, and it shows. Much of the film moves very slowly for no reason other than to pad the time. Really, there's nothing interesting being said about Giger that we either hadn't heard before or couldn't surmise ourselves. Giger would have been better honored with a retrospective about his life and career rather than this overlong and exploitative eulogy to a sorely missed genius.",1500854400,,1825,4.524242424242424
8720021,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,An affordable dvd showing some work that's been around since the 60s.

I downloaded the newest version of Silverlight; I hunted for for an option, but nada. So. Damn. Irritating!

OK, got IT in here and he was able to enable the subtitles. Good video, but there should still be some info in the description about subtitles.",1491350400,,499,4.670454545454546
8720023,5,B00ZFOUMZ4,"Great film of about the life and the final year of a truly visionary artist. The devotion of his wife Carmen and his personal staff is great to see, especially due to H.R.G.'s obviously unhealthy state at the time of this documentary.",1474416000,,234,4.595238095238095
8720024,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,"The documentary DARK STAR captures the elderly H.R. Giger as a shuffling, slow speaking man so physically frail that his every breath seems the exhalation of death.  He lives in a horders house crammed to overflowing with books, and with an overgrown backyard that includes a sort of miniature ghost train of his own design, and everywhere his artwork flickers and glides: brazenly placed, carelessly displayed, seen directly or perhaps noted quickly from the corner of your eye.  Strangely rendered women with spiked nipples and corpse-like eyes.  Disturbing, reptilian entities with grotesque mandibles.  Piles of skulls and mottled, bloated infants.  Egyptian and Babylonian styles mix with what Giger called bio-mechanical entities, part living beings, part machine.

DARK STAR is not a biographical film.  It does tell something of Gigers personal life, most particularly of his first love, who committed suicide, and of his wives, and a little about his family.  It also offers a small portrait of his parents, and Giger himself is seen as a young man via archival footage.  But the focus is on the here and now, with Giger at times seeming entirely disengaged and at times spot on, making dry comments that allow us to see theres still someone in there, alive behind the physical delicacy.  And there is, of course, display of his art.

Giger is generally described as a surrealist, but whatever the -ism, his vision is remarkably grotesque and almost always disturbing.  He first gained notoriety for posters and then for album covers (most famously Emerson, Lake and Palmers BRAIN SALAD SURGERY; Debbie Harrys KOOKOO; and the notorious inside-album poster, titled Penis Landscape, for The Dead Kennedys FRANKENCHRIST.)  He is probably most widely known as the principle designer for the 1979 film ALIEN, with its uncomfortably organic look and remarkably effective monster, quite unlike anything that had been seen on film up to that time and still pretty much in a class of its own.  These works get more than a mention, but there is more emphasis on Gigers general body of work, and the film concludes with a sense of his own wonder at how he ever came to make such things and at the sheer volume and ultimate display of his work.  He is very clearly in love with everything he has made.

But DARK STAR does not really offer the answers fans of Gigers work want.  There is some backgroundGigers childhood toys included a human skull, and he was both terrified and fascinated by a mummy in a local museumand it seems clear that he used his art as a means of confronting his darkest fears.  But theres no deep explanation, nothing that would satisfy questions about where, exactly, these frightening images come from.  Perhaps Giger did not clearly understand it himself.  Whatever the case, he keeps his mystery, saying little, explaining less, and if there were answers, he took them with him: he died at age 74, not long after filming for DARK STAR ended.

This is a remarkably intriguing, yet entirely unpretentious, documentary, and fans of Gigers art will no doubt find it fascinating.  But a word of warning: if you don't like Gigers art, you're unlikely to develop an enthusiasm for it from this film.  (Me, Im among those who find his work both fascinating and repellent; it interests me, but I wouldnt have any of it in my house.)  The DVD comes with a short making of documentary and several photograph collections of Gigers work.  Recommended.

8720025,4,B00ZFOUMZ4,"When I was young and first saw the movie Alien, I was gripped by the artwork. It's different in a way that seems plausibly otherworldly, as opposed to the stereotypical gigantic eyed 'greys'. I long wondered about who this person was or what they were like, but frankly I was too lazy to look it up sooner. This seemed like a promising opportunity.

Through 'Dark Star' there is a glance into the man's life, but it's the twilight. During the filming, Giger was obviously in stark decline. There are some examples of the sort of man he is, which is why I watched. For the most part, we hear through surrogates and while it was rich, it felt just a bit lacking at times.

For a novice to art like myself, I found it a worthwhile watch.",1464825600,,734,4.350364963503649
