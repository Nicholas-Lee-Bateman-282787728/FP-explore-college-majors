8728938,5,B013VXOWYM,"I got this because I'm a Native American story geek. I know several Navajos on the rez, and some of the stories they tell are interesting, as well as rife with government and big energy corporation interferences for the natural way of life and disrespect for the Native people and their land. All land is sacred because it gives us life (my words as a nature lover and gardener). They have been put into poverty and had their language and spiritual practices washed down with the dogma and religiosity of Catholism (or another protestant religion) - some even practicing these 2 very conflicting religions. All this has contributed to their depression on the reservation. Still, I think their ancestors try to reach them through nature, some unforgotten old ways, the elders, medicine people, and through the ""mystical"". Unlike the populace of white people, they are very down-to-earth, family oriented people (with a great sense of humor). I always feel at home with them. This movie realistically reflects all of those elements while adding some Hollywood graphics to drive home the mystical aspect of their ways. I wish these small production Native America movies got more media attention in large theaters because they always depict a realistic picture, they  employ/use the Native people as actors, and incorporate the spiritual aspect of reaching deeper into oneself to see that there is more to life than the 8-5 corporate and consumer lifestyle.

I prefer movies that don't show bloody, violent scenes or sex. I want to enjoy my movies, not have to keep covering my eyes. I could keep my eyes open with this movie the whole time!

Watch the preveiws for the upcoming movies. Some look really funny and others interesting.",1454112000,2,1730,4.97923875432526
8728939,2,B013VXOWYM,Interesting movie. I am not sure of the plot line though. A man fighting against a government conspiracy but for what end exactly? I did not understand the 'seeker' / 'protector' -- what was being sought and protected?,1445990400,,218,4.7631578947368425
