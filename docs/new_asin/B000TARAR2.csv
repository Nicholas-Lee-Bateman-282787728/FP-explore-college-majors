8325727,4,B000TARAR2,"I have Muscle Endurance on VHS because I didn't want to buy the DVD that included another workout that I didn't want.  M.E. is a good solid weight workout.  I like the way Cathe alternates between upper and lower body throughout the workout.  The only problems I have with the workout is the quality of the audio(up and down) and lack of cueing; she says to get ready for the next exercise but doesn't say what the next exercise will be in most cases, so you have to rewind or pause to get ready. If you do the workout enough though, you can memorize the sequence and should have less problems with cueing.",1204675200,,606,4.345132743362832
