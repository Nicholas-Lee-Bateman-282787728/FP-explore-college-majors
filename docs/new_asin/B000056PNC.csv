1. Mario Lemieux

2. Bobby Orr

3. Gordie Howe

4. Patrick Roy

5. More titles from the Original Six Series (especially The Canadiens)

6. A Pittsburgh Penguins DVD like what has been done with the Red Wings",1108684800,,378,4.485294117647059
1399273,1,B000056PNC,"Leader, Champion and Legend??? OK HE IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. Anyone notice how bad his teams got whenever Wayne Gretzky wasn't his teammate any longer? He never knew when to stop. For a while, he was succeeding in passing off his own skill as just that, his own skill, but once Gretzky left him out there alone, it became very obvious who he really was, or, I should say, wasn't. People like me recognized how overrated he was even when he was with the Oilers. He thought he was old school, when he was just old.",1091318400,,513,4.298969072164948
1399274,5,B000056PNC,"I'm not a hockey fan. I've been a big NFL buf.
Then Messier and Rangers came to US. Whatever you say, hockey is minor pro sports comparing NFL or NBA or MLB in the States.
But when I watched this Messier Video/dvds, I just realized how much I was missing not following NHL.
I knew there was Gretz, Mario, etc... But none of them were like Mess. After Jordans' 1st retirement, this was the only sport personality video/dvds I could enjoy watching. And I still watch.
The reason is this is not a just hockey player video/dvds, but just like Jordan' parsonality video/dvds, it's about life. It contains biographical elements.
All the sports fans can enjoy this if you see that way.",1044489600,3,678,4.565573770491803

7932498,5,B000056PNC,"Any Mark Messier fan must buy this DVD immediately.... Favorite player of all time, can't watch it enough. Arrived quickly as well.",1357776000,,131,5.0
7932499,3,B000056PNC,"Mark Messier is probably my favorite all-time hockey player; he's certainly in the top 5. He brought everything to his game and was an incredible leader and champion. This collection of footage establishes that well.

I became a hockey fan as a kid when the Oilers put an end to the Islanders' dynasty in 1984 (the Islanders had won the previous 4 Cups and Edmonton went on to win 4 of the next 5, and 5 of the next 7 Cups). After Wayne Gretzky was surprisingly and dramatically traded to the L.A. Kings in 1988, Messier led the Oilers to yet another cup in 1990. Then, when Messier came to New York, he already had more championships than the Rangers had in their long history. He ended 54 years of suffering for so many die-hard Rangers fans by leading them to the Stanley Cup in 1994.

Mark Messier is one of the best that ever played the game. Period. It's a lot of fun to re-live some of the great moments of his career with this disc. However, while Mess' gets 5 stars, this disc only gets 3, because so much of the voice-over script is so incredibly lame. It's fine when they're simply re-counting facts and so forth, but the ""colorful"" language is embarrassingly bad at times.

All things considered, this is still a worthwhile disc and a lot of fun, especially at this affordable price (I got mine in the marketplace and paid just a couple bucks!) it is well worth it (especially in the off-season, or any time Bettman is the league commissioner -- another lockout this year ... Bettman's gotta go).",1348790400,,1508,4.4763636363636365
7932500,3,B000056PNC,"this dvd was ok . it left out crucial aspects of marks' game . the huge hits as well as that mean streak  that mess was known 4 if you got on the bad side of him. some of drama has been drained out of the footage with careless editing of the television announcers call; game 6 vs the devils 4 eg.  a better or broader selection of clips from the oiler & ranger days to chronicle ""the complete"" player could have made this dvd 5 star . mark led by example ; stick, skates,& fists",1245024000,,478,3.96875
7932501,5,B000056PNC,"This DVD is one of the best sports profiles I have ever seen. For one it details the life of arguably one of the greatest athletes in the history of professional sports. Even if you know the life of Messier and feel you don't the DVD, trust me you do. The DVD begins with a combination of short video clips of Messier with someone reading the poem ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling. I use that part as a football coach to motivate my players in Mississippi. Even though none of them know anything about hockey, they could run through a brick wall. This Movie is must for any sports fan. If you are a Messier fan and don't have it get it today. Because if you watch it everyday until the day you die, it won't be enough!",1137110400,5,709,4.182481751824818
7932502,3,B000056PNC,"I couldn't believe that it said it would be released in 2010, but the Warner Bros. website says that it's released on the tenth of January. No extra games which is really what I buy most sport DVD's for, so I might wait for them to release one with games, like they are doing with the Gretzky DVD.",1136246400,,297,4.137931034482759
7932503,5,B000056PNC,"I was going to abstain from commenting, but then I saw the LUDICROUS statement above, reading:

""Anyone notice how bad his teams got whenever Wayne Gretzky wasn't his teammate any longer?  like me recognized how overrated he was even when he was with the Oilers. He thought he was old school, when he was just old.""

1. He led the Oilers to a Cup, OVER Gretzky's Kings in the playoffs, and WITHOUT Gretzky in the Finals.

2. He led the Rangers to a Cup in 1994, WITHOUT Gretzky.

3. The guy scored nearly 20 goals and 50-60 points a season PAST the age of 40. You have to be a complete imbecile or complete hockey novice not to recognize how great that is.

Enough said. Must be another disgruntled Flyers fan. Time to go watch my Lightning Cup DVD while I anxiously await this release.",1126483200,10,786,4.386206896551724
7932504,5,B000056PNC,"The only man to wear the captain ""C"" for two different Stanley Cup winning franchises, Mark Messier is without doubt an immortal of the NHL and easily one of the Top 10 players to ever lace-up skates. His on-ice accomplishments -- 6 Stanley Cups, 2 Hart Trophies, second only to Gretzky in regular season and playoff points -- coupled with his legendary leadership and hard-nosed style illustrate the very special player that the unheralded Messier ultimately became. Messier is a throwback to the ""old-school"" of hockey players, combining the vicious streak of Gordie Howe, the wicked slapshot of Bobby Hull and the fiery stare of Rocket Richard into one mean package. Sadly, the underperformance of Messier's teams over much of the last decade -- as well as his advancing years -- haven't showcased his greatness to newer fans. This updating of the 1997 VHS release with additional footage and features will allow old fans like me to relive Messier's glory years and exhibit his greatness to younger fans. (Reviewer's Bias: I grew-up in Edmonton and was blessed with the chance to watch the hometown-boy-made-good Messier on a nightly basis for a dozen years. That said, a lot of other folks seem to think Messier is pretty special, so I don't think my judgement is clouded THAT badly. [*grin*])",1125705600,5,1297,4.954128440366972
7932505,5,B000056PNC,"Messier is the greatest player in the NHL.  That isn't to say that he's the best but no one has the resume that he does.  As for Messier not being anything after he was no longer paired with Gretzky, that's why his teams have more wins and better records overall? His two Stanley Cups (Gretzky never won one without Messier on his team)? Two Hart Trophies (None after 1988 for Gretzky)? No matter how badly his teams played over the past seven seasons, that doesn't diminish or eradicate all that Mark Messier has accomplished in the game of hockey.

This collection will be a great addition to my DVD library.",1121212800,6,610,4.527272727272727
