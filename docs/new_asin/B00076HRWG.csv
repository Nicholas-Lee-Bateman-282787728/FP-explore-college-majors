The fact that some 6,600 elderly women from all walks of life were provided by the U.S. government with this ""trip of a lifetime"" is incredible indeed! I found ""Pilgrimage of Remembrance"" very insightful and interesting. I highly recommend it!",1468281600,,395,5.092307692307692
8325679,5,B00076HRWG,"I don't remember how I found this video, but it has become a staple of my WWI curriculum.  It is hard to pick out a few parts to highlight because this is one of best videos I have seen.  From the discussions of whether to send the soldiers home to fervor over how African American women would go over to France, you get a great picture of how this war changed the way we deal with those who have given their lives for our country.  Even my macho football players were surprised by how they were affected by watching this video.  It makes you think not just of the soldiers who died, but of the families they left behind.",1320969600,3,621,4.19327731092437
