8305770,2,B000MV9O18,"In the bizarre pantheon of Ted V. Mikels movies, this is one of the most boring. Ted's movies are (almost) always entertaining for all the wrong reasons, and this was his shot at the then-popular ""women in prison"" genre. Featuring some of the most utterly forgettable dialogue, horrible acting, humorous hair, retro clothes, and downright ugliest wallpaper imaginable, ""10 Violent Women"" has moments of entertaining camp value but fails to rise to the level of ""The Astro Zombies"" or the wonderfully kitsch ""Girl in Gold Boots."" Here's the essence of the plot: ten women are working in a mining operation (most miners wear shorts and tank tops, you know) which fails to make them rich. With no problem whatsoever, one hits on the idea that they should go into a life of crime. It is amazing how easy it is to convince nine other good girls to embrace a life of felony with no issue whatsoever. The rest of the movie follows their crime spree, their eventual imprisonment, and the escape from the big house.

These women (some of which were Mikels' ""Castle Ladies"") stage one of the funniest jewel robberies ever filmed, even stealing a sacred scarab ring from a sheik (indirectly) in the process (a subplot, like many others in Mikels productions that is a huge investment of time with no real payoff.) Do not miss the theatrics of Frank Walshe as the Jeweler in one of the worst cases of overacting you will ever see in any film anywhere. The pacing of the film is uneven and oddly segmented, with the intermittent presence of title cards like a silent movie would have to explain what is obviously going on, e.g. ""the chase is on,"" and ""shoot-out at duck park."" (I don't know why they are all in lower case, perhaps Ted is a fan of e. e. cummings.) The story gets wild and wooly, with chases (please note the sheik's moustache falling off during the car chase,) absolutely wretched dancing in a nightclub (which foreshadows even more inept belly dancing later in the film,) and Ted (with ever-present power horn necklace accoutrement in place) as a drug dealer caught in the middle of the female rampage. Ted's death by stiletto heel is both original and hilarious, and is the defining moment of the film. Ted has had a lot of parts in his own films, but I must say he actually does a decent job here with his role, and is far better than normal; he's also far better than the other actors involved (not that that's saying much.) Ted is also a bit, how shall I say...hirsute, in this film, making Robin Williams look like a Nair spokesmodel by comparison. Along the way there are carjackings, water gun fights, and Las Vegas craziness until a misstep lands them in jail, where they meet the warden, Miss Terry (who apparently was in real life a professional drummer; she's clearly not a professional actress.) This is why the whole movie was made of course.

In this sadistic prison (actually filmed in an abandoned jail, so some of the sets look great) Terry has her favorites, and there are duties expected of her darlings, of course. Our ten girls refuse to bow to her with much chewing of the scenery (""I never crawl for anybody!"") and though Terry herself is in charge of their section, she is being investigated for inappropriate behavior by her superior (Terry's boss certainly has an...ummmm...dated look) in another plot thread that goes nowhere. There is, of course, an obligatory shower scene complete with catfight (though they do not disrobe for their shower, and believe me it is nothing you want to see.) Terry has her own unconventional methods of interrogation (again, I'm sure you are shocked) involving a riding crop, a bucket, and snapping a wet towel like it was a gym class (""I'll whip the evil out of you!"") Come on, it's a towel. How horrifying can it be? Eventually there's a knife missing from the dining hall (Really? Prisons have knives?) which is a setup to subject another of the group to inequitable treatment, with senior citizen Terry donning a negligee (shudder) for the inquisition. This proves to be the turning point for our antiheroes.

Eventually in full revolt from the inhuman conditions (you'll sympathize after seeing the film) the girls stage a clever jailbreak, though most of the last twenty minutes of the movie are so dark it's hard to see what's going on. The one scene that is lighted well clearly reveals one of the girls playing cards with her toes, but there's always a lot going on in any Ted V. Mikels movie. The conclusion is anticlimactic and didn't really matter much anyway, as the entire point of the film was to show the women in prison. Once they were out, it's fine to stop at any time (the sooner the better.)

The DVD has special features, including a trailer containing many plot spoilers, and the obligatory Ted V. Mikels commentary track. Ted seems like an amiable guy, but his commentaries are virtually interchangeable from movie to movie: he does provide some information on the actors and how the film was made, but mostly it is comments about the locations involved or props. Typical examples include ""Here we are in Las Vegas,"" ""At a Holiday Inn in Santa Monica...,"" ""Oh, this was a carpet factory in Santa Ana,"" ""We sure had a lot of locations in this movie, I'll tell you...,"" and finally, in reference to a mop bucket used to clean a hall, this piece of trivia: ""By the way, I still have that bucket in my studio."" You get the idea.

This is not a very good movie, not even by the standards of Ted V. Mikels films, but I gave it two stars for having a touch of quirky camp value present in movies on the cusp of being so bad they're good. Most of this is just bad, but a few scenes can't help but entertain, most notably the jewel heist and the belly dancing. If you are in the mood for something weird and are a hardened B-movie veteran, then you might want to consider watching ""10 Violent Women."" Everyone else should pass.",1334880000,9,5905,4.625357483317445
