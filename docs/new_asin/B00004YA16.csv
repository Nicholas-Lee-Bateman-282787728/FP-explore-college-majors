The first 5 episodes stay true to what I remember and end with the first use of the wave motion gun and their escape from Jupiter.  It was great to see it again and the fact that Voyager might not finish the series greatly disturbs me.  Please do fill out the reply card if you purchase this DVD. =)",971568000,7,404,4.153846153846154
1373971,3,B00004YA16,"The legendary Star Blazers TV series (the Americanized version of Japan's ""Space Battleship Yamato"") has finally arrived on DVD!  ...But don't get too excited yet, fans, because this DVD edition (which includes the first 5 episodes of Star Blazers) comes to us NOT from a major anime studio, but from a little company called Voyager Entertainment.  It seems that Voyager holds exclusive rights to all things Yamato, and that is very bad news for the millions of rabid Star Blazers enthusiasts in this country (and the world).  Why?  Because it appears that the folks at Voyager know about as much about how to make a DVD as my cousin Bubba does!  If you can manage to wrest this disc away from its fancy case (complete with typos on the back cover!) without breaking it in half (and that's a big IF, `cause this bad boy is constructed like a plastic bear trap!) and pop it into your player, you will immediately be struck by the obvious shoddiness of this production.  Even the obligatory FBI warning looks cheesy!  Then there's the menu design: nothing but a solid gray screen with two little pictures at the bottom left (one for PLAY and one for CHAPTERS)!  Select PLAY to start the feature, and step back in time to the year 1979 - long before DVDs were even thought of.  In 1979, the audio and video quality of this disc would have seemed good.  Keep that in mind, and you won't be quite so disappointed.  Now you can sing along to the inspiring theme song, marvel at the stylish animation, and savor the sophisticated storyline.  Remember that an inferior Star Blazers disc is a whole lot better than nothing...and nothing is what we've had for far too long.  And unfortunately, since Voyager OWNS the Star Force, a properly restored version of this excellent animated program may not be available for many years...if ever.  For that reason alone, I will (reluctantly) recommend this disc.  The picture is a bit grainy and the sound warbles in places, but it's still _Our_ _Star_ _Blazers_!  Keep your digital expectations low and let your imagination soar with this blast from the past! ...1 star for the DVD, 5 stars for the show.
NOTE: I read on the Web that Voyager is waiting for the little consumer response cards (included with the DVD) to come back before starting on a Volume 2 disc, so if you want more Star Blazers, make sure you fill the card out and send it in (YOU provide the stamp, of course).",970272000,46,2414,4.618266978922716
1373972,4,B00004YA16,"I disagree with the comments above about the picture and sound quality of the Star Blazers DVD.  For a animated TV show that was made in the mid 70s I think the quality is really good, especially compared to the video tape collect I made of the series over 15 years ago.  This really is an exceptional animated series and even if the quality had been poor, I'd still buy it because of all the great memories from my youth that it brings to the surface.  I have not seen the VHS version so I don't know how the DVD quality compares but the Star Blazer DVD is definitely a must have for any fan.  Voyager does need to do a better job on the DVD menu as well as add some bonus material but I believe they are planning on doing this based on response from the fans. So if we want to see more of the series then we have to show Voyager that we will purchase their product.",970272000,,867,4.052631578947368
1373973,2,B00004YA16,"I would have loved to give this DVD a 5 star rating, but I can't. I consider myself a life long member of the Star Force and have waited for years for the DVD release of this brilliant series. However, I can honestly say that I don't think I've seen a DVD yet where less effort was involved in its production.
There are *no* extras at all. The title and chapter selection screens are just plain ugly. But who cares? Those are just cosmetic anyway right? Still, it shows how little they cared about doing a good job.  The DVD also clocks in at about 112 minutes (the first 5 episodes of the first season), which I feel is not a good value considering the capacity of DVD and the aforementioned lack of extras. But then again, the VHS tapes were even worse. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this DVD release is that the sound and image quality are poor. Of course, the sound and picture quality were poor back in the 80's when I used to watch this show, but you'd think that they'd try just a little bit harder to polish it up and remaster the sound before committing this show to digital posterity.
If it wasn't for my sheer unadulterated love of this show, I would say that this is the worst DVD in my collection...and that's a shame.",969494400,12,1242,4.330472103004292
1374004,4,B00004YA16,"One day I was discussing anime with some people at work and it made me think of the Star Blazers tune back from when I was 7 or 8 years old.  So, I went lookin on the internet for the series on DVD.  At the time they hadn't even released part I yet, so I waited and bought it the day it came out.  The grainy film (it hasn't been touched up) and quirky music only seem to add value for me because it is exactly the way I remembered it.  Enhanced sound may have been okay though, since I did spend a lot of money on my surround system.  (Thus one star deducted)
Also what may be a point of interest... I filled in the registration card that came with the DVD.  Then I waited for a long time for the second disc to come out.  When it finally came out I popped in the disc and they had added all the features I requested.  Lost footage, etc.  Except for better sound.",1010448000,2,864,3.947976878612717
1374005,3,B00004YA16,"I remember when growing up in the U.S., I would get up a little early to get ready, then watch the latest episode of Star Blazers, then rush outside so I wouldn't miss the school bus.  I didn't want to miss a single bit.
When I heard about the DVD, I definitely wanted to see it all again.  Now that I'm older, I see it as more than just an action-packed space opera.  I also notice the character development as Star Force learn to work together to overcome not only the struggle against their common enemy, the Gamalons; but also to overcome their own internal conflicts (Derek Wildstar coming to terms of his missing brother--Presumed Dead, and finding the balance between Wildstar's fury and Mark Venture's caution come to mind).
The DVD itself leaves little to be desired.  The disc hard to remove from the case and there is no extra content.  In fact the menu allows you to start the movie or select a chapter.  That's it.  The one redeeming quality is that the disc plays the episodes one after another (i.e. no ending credits--back to menu between episodes).  This looks like Voyager Entertainment took the videotape content and simply slapped it on a DVD.  You get nothing extra.
I give 5 stars for the content but 1 star for the DVD for an overall rating of 3.  Despite the rating, if you like Sci-Fi/Fantasy (or if you enjoyed it as a kid), you will find it worthwhile (Unless you already have it on VHS).",997747200,2,1415,4.4921875
1374006,4,B00004YA16,"I loved this series as a child and still find the plot interesting. However, the science is a bad, snow on Mars etc. If you can overlook this the story is great. No DVD extras other than chapter search. They make up for this in the second DVD with a scene cut from the original Japanese series, character bios and better navagation. Not the best DVD production, but at least someone is putting this classic series on DVD. A must it you loved the series as a child or for your own children.",995500800,2,489,4.268817204301075
1374007,4,B00004YA16,"I remember watching this and some of the other older anime series. I still enjoy it.
Humans have to be saved from extinction, and aliens provide the potential means to save the planet. The only problem is the Earthlings have to travel to the aliens to get the help.
The DVD itself doesn't have the extras that most anime DVDs have. The DVD menu seems almost pointless. You only have the dubbed version here. I wish they had left it as individual episodes instead of making it one long movie.
Even with these problems, I would still recommend this DVD to any fan. It's a much better deal than getting the tapes.",995241600,,610,4.455357142857143
1374008,4,B00004YA16,"Star Blazers:  The Quest for Iscandar Part I, contains the first five episodes (of 26) of the first season of the cult-favorite Americanized Japanese Anime series from the early 1980's.
For the uninitiated, here's a rundown of the plot.  In 2199 Earth was under attack by an ""evil"" alien race called the Gamilons.  The Gamilons bombed earth with ""planet bombs"" which destroyed the planet and emitted high levels of radiation, thus driving mankind into underground cities.  In one Earth year the planet would become uninhabitable.  Queen Starsha of Iscandar offers mankind hope in the form of the Cosmic DNA which would cure all mankind from the radiation sickness.  She sends Earth a message along with powerful technology that will allow mankind to travel to Iscandar to get the Cosmic DNA.  The Star Force is formed to travel to Iscandar to fetch the Cosmic DNA.  Their faithful battleship is the Argo, a renovated WWII era navy battleship remade into a Starship.  There is just one minor problem though, Iscandar is 148,000 Light Years away.  No one has ever traveled that far before.  More importantly, the Star Force only has one year to travel there and back for a total of 296,000 Light Years.
Here is a summary of the first five episodes included on this DVD:
Episode 1:  Introduction to the Earth-Gamilon war, The Battle of Pluto and the bravery of Alex Wildstar.  Also, the mysterious spaceship from deep space and its offer of hope to mankind and a dogfight over the Yamato.
Episode 2:  Raise the Yamato!!!  Converting the Yamato to Space Battleship Argo.  Argo's first attack.
Episode 3:  Assemble the Star Force!!!  The Gamilon's try to take out the Argo before it takes off.  The Argo launches.  Plus, take a tour of the Argo.
Episode 4:  In order to travel to Iscandar (296,000 light years) within one year the Argo must travel beyond the speed of light.  The crew prepares for a Space Warp while avoiding a Gamilon attack.  Plus, snow on Mars.
Episode 5:  The Argo gets pulled into Jupiter and comes across a Floating Continent which holds a Gamilon base.  Plus, the Argo tests out its greatest weapon - The Wave Motion Gun.
Overall, I can't be any happier that Voyager has released the series on DVD.  Star Blazers was one of my all-time favorite childhood cartoon series (along with Transformers, Robotech, GI Joe, He-man and Thundercats).  However, you must admit that the production work of this DVD was VERY bush league.  The navigation is laughable and the chapter breaks are almost non-sensical (about 5 minutes before the end of each episode).
Here's my rundown:
Great:  Star Blazers on DVD
Good:  The episodes
Bad:  No DVD exclusive features???
Ugly:  Pitiful navigation.
Summed up, if you were ever a Star Blazers fan, give this a watch.  It's great for a trip down memory lane.  If you've NEVER seen Star Blazers, give it a try, it's a cult classic from the 80's (along with other Americanized anime greats like Robotech, Voltron, Transor Z, etc).  The animation may look a little dated, but the storyline still holds its own very well against anything out there today.  This series has stood the test of time.  Due to limited distribution this show may have slipped by the radar of a lot of people but it caught on like a fire with those who did catch it.  Try it, you WON'T be disappointed.
Overall assessment:  5 stars for Star Blazers, 1 star for Voyager's production.

1374009,4,B00004YA16,"Not to be a broken record, but I must agree with many of the other reviewers. This is a shoddily produced DVD. There is essentially no menu, and there are no extras at all. However, the picture and sound quality were fine by my standards.
On to the show: the battles aren't quite as fast or explosive as I remember and the wave motion gun isn't as devastating as a remember, but Star Blazers is still a kick ax space adventure. I still think Nova is hot and the Tiger Squadron still rock. I will definately be moving on to vol. II, where it looks like the features and DVD quality are better.",983491200,,592,4.247787610619469
1374010,5,B00004YA16,well time to write a good review of the dvd itself. all the other reviewers wrote about thier childhoods. the volume 2 dvd is far better than the volume 2 dvd. volume 2 has it all.well almost. picture restoration is up a bit comparable to volume 1. this time there is actually a menu. included are ship crew bio's and a deleted scene that was in the movie but not the series. you can ethier chose to play the epiodes in movie form or in singles. all in all a good improvement. if you want to see something cool check the art of the charaters. its when you look at their bio's. look different. Well it should. It's from Yamato 2000:The Quest For Iscandall. Aremake of series one with up to date animation. email me for more.,980899200,,723,4.2846715328467155
1374011,4,B00004YA16,"About 15 years ago, I found an article in a comic book advertising Star Blazers on video. I was excited at the prospect of watching my favorite animated series all over again. However, when I got the tapes I found the picture was very dark. I had to adjust the bright and contrast on the tv and even then it was not a perfect picture(my videos were made by Kidmark, INC.). While this occured on the entire ""Quest for Iscandar"" series, the next two series, ""The Comet Empire"" and ""The Bolar Wars"" were normal. I did acquire a tape of the original movie ""Space Cruiser Yamato""-which the Quest for Iscandar series is based on for American audiences- so I at least had a good picture, but it had a drawback too since I don't understand Japanese. Now that I got the first dvd of ""Quest for Iscandar"", I am happy that I have a very clear picture. To all who read this-and to those who may have experienced my problems with the videos-I recommend this dvd.",978480000,5,949,4.3977272727272725
1374012,2,B00004YA16,"When i first heard of the possibility of a star blazers dvd i was quite excited. Unfortunately once i received it,i was throughly disappointed. Even though the original program was quite old,voyager could have done a much better job here. They cut corners to save money. Even some of the poorest vcd's have better video and sound quality than this dvd edition. You would do yourself much better to buy the current video tapes that are out there. As long as you have a halfway decent vcr,you'll do much better than this dvd edition. Keep your eye out for the japanese edition dvd's. I'm sure they are coming,if they aren't out already. They won't cut corners at the expense of quality. Save your money and spend it on some other anime dvd's like sol bianca.(Don't waste your money on the funimation dragonball z dvds,or the evangelion dvd's either.

1374013,4,B00004YA16,"I ordered this DVD with the expectation that it'd be an amusing return to childhood diversions of getting up early to watch Star Blazers before school.

7927204,5,B00004YA16,"Takes me back to my childhood!  As others have noted, the quality of the DVD itself is not the greatest. It's an old cartoon converted for this format, and in very average fashion.  I'd imagine it's probably about the same quality that I would have originally watched the show in, on my father's old 19"" big-box television in the early '80s.  That does not bother me in the slightest big, however... if you loved the show growing up, you will still love this DVD regardless. The second the opening theme song plays you will be sucked right back in! And there aren't any better options out there for re-watching these original episodes that I'm aware of, so beggars can't be choosers!  From what I read on Amazon, the quality was improved for the later episodes of the first series on the other DVDs for sale out there, so if and when I get those, I will be able to confirm. In the meantime, if you're a fan, go ahead and get these - you won't regret it.",1461628800,,953,4.367231638418079

Or maybe amazon should start a dual rating system.  This dvd release is really bad.  It looks like they got ahold of some tapes from tv station back in the 70's.  I've been comparing it to the chinese release of the original japanese series... there is absolutely no comparison.  The only reason I would buy this series is for the american soundtrack.  It's nostalgic.  If you're watching Star Blazers for the first time, just get the chinese version, it's way less expensive, 26 episodes for about $40 (compared to 5 episodes for $30???), it has the original japanese dialogue with english subtitles, it's UNCUT (and there was a bit cut from the american version) and WHAT QUALITY!!  It looks like they got the original film negatives and remastered it.  This american dvd... well.. that's greed for you.

It is true for Part II of the series, though.  All in all, it leaves the viewer only nearly satisfied.  The price is just a bit high for what you're getting.",1031356800,,378,4.222222222222222
7927210,4,B00004YA16,"I was first introduced to Star Blazers as a 12-year-old in the fall of 1979. I only caught the second half of this series, but I loved it, and I love it as much today.
Of course, having watched other sci-fi series like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 and others in later years, I try to look for little inconsistencies in a storyline such as Star Blazers. It's not that I want to tear the storyline apart, like ""The Nit Pickers Guide to Star Trek,"" but I just want to see where are slight errors or abberations in that storyline.
For instance, after the battle at Pluto, it only took Captain Avatar's ship a very short time to return to Earth. However, while making preparations for the jump to warp from the moon to Mars, Captain Avatar says it would normally take months to make such a journey at normal travel speeds. How, then, could Avatar's ship get back to Earth in such a short time if his ship did not have warp capability?
But, as I said, I am not attempting to tear the storyline apart. This storyline, in the format of the old Republic Serials like ""Commando Cody,"" compels you to come back for more. At the end of each episode, you find out how much time is left for Earth. And you want to know what lies in store for the Argo and its crew in upcoming episodes. It is such a beautifully crafted storyline that way!
I guess some characters like IQ-9 are meant as comic relief for the storyline, but I would not have put IQ-9 in the storyline were I its creator. These kind of characters just detract and divert from the storyline. But, again, this is just a minor issue. IQ-9 does have some good moments later in the storyline, and I do note that in his favour.
But I guess the best thing about this storyline is that Captain Avatar does not lead the Away Missions. Avatar stays on the bridge of the Argo, where he belongs. He does not put himself directly in danger, like Captain James T. Kirk or Captain John J. Sheridan. Avatar knows his place, and he leaves his subordinates to go into danger and do the dirty work. Besides, Avatar is so critical to the success of the mission, it would be suicidal to put him directly in harm's way.
Well, that pretty well covers it for me. I think my review of this DVD would carry over to the other DVDs in this series. Not that my opinion counts for much, of course, but I think I have given this DVD a fair hearing.
No, you can overlook the inconsistencies in this storyline and love Starblazers. I have since I was 12 years old, and I'll love it for many years to come.",1016236800,,2534,4.292275574112735
