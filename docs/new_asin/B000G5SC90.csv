It was a present and I thought I was buying something that played on a dvd player, since it was labled a dvd.  I watched it with the family I gave it to, but we had to watch it on a laptop.  The content of the dvd was great.",1290211200,,304,3.7936507936507935
8325112,5,B000G5SC90,"This video was very done.  The photography is amazing, and we see the personal side of the artist, as well as his technical skills.  The pieces the artist creates are fabulous in their form, their colors and the way they capture light.  The only downside I experienced is that the DVD does not play on my regular DVD player.  I had no problems watching it using my computer's DVD drive.",1233964800,,386,4.4714285714285715
8325113,5,B000G5SC90,This is a very nice video that displays some of Lino's very masterly glassblowing prowess as well as some nice personal vignettes that exhibit Lino's lovely personality.  The only problem I have with this DVD is that you can't play it on a TV DVD player.,1173312000,6,254,4.521739130434782
