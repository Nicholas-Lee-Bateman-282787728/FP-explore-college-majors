7903661,5,B0000065CV,"Count von Count is the host of his own countdown video show. On this video, you'll get to see 8 of Sesame Street's greatest music videos.

I have heard all those songs when I was a little boy and liked watching Sesame Street on TV. I know a lot of those songs heard on the show and I love them, especially all the songs on this tape! The songs include ...

The Ten Commandments Of Health

Doowop Hop

ZZ Blues

Honk Around The Clock

Letter B

Wet Paint

Do The Rubber Duck

Count It Higher

Besides seeing Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch making brief appearances, you'll get to see Ernie, Bert, and a few other familiar Sesame Street friends in some of those tunes. These songs really come back to you once you've revisited them since your childhood. I am now sharing these songs from this tape, and some others, with some of my young friends and relatives who are Sesame Street fans like me.

7903662,5,B0000065CV,"Of the late '80's Sesame Street videos, this is one of the simplest and most straightforward. Outside of a couple of  very brief interstitials of Big Bird and Oscar, it includes no ""Street"" time.  The  usual Sesame Street neighbors. (Bob, Gordon, Maria, etc.) make no appearance and there is very little in the way of specially created video content.
Instead, Count von Count hosts the Sesame Street Music Video countdown, briefly introducing each of the eight featured songs.  The segments don't all focus on any particular concept, but, instead, cover a smattering of topics and seem to be chosen for the charm of their Rock inspired songs.
The songs featured are...
The 10 Commandments of Health
Doo Wop Hop
ZZ Blues
Honk around the Clock
Letter B
Wet Paint
Do De Rubber Duck
Count it Higher",1082246400,5,794,4.8161764705882355
7903663,5,B0000065CV,probably my favorite sesame street video. I loved watching it when i was younger and i still love it now. One of my favorite things about the video is the way they count down the videos like on MTV.It also has some of my favoritsesame street songs on it. It's really to bad its out of print because I broke my copy of it and I wasn't able to fix it. I really suggest this video for people who love sesame street. It's a must have.my favorite video on the tape is wet paint. I can't seem to remember what happens during wet paint music video and i've been trying to find the music video to the wet paint song to download on the internet so if you know where i can download the video or can remind me of what happens during the music video please email me....,1033430400,2,757,4.087248322147651
7903664,5,B0000065CV,"This video kept the attention of my kids immensly. They were always amused while watching. It was great watching all of my favorite musicians play as  muppets especially Elton John and John Travolta dancing. I can't wait  untill it is reprinted. My kids watched it so much they broke the tape, and  I don't have it anymore.",965088000,,323,4.631578947368421
7903665,5,B0000065CV,"I got this video as a hand-me-down and it is wonderful!  Erika looks  forward to watching it and knows that whenever we open the tv cabinet,  she's going to get to watch it.  Her favorite song seems to vary week to  week, but she dances to Do De Rubber Duck, ZZ Blues and 10 Commandments of  Health regularly.  She comes to me to be lifted up to do the Do Wop  Hop.
If this ever comes back out, I highly recommend it!",964656000,2,417,4.0
