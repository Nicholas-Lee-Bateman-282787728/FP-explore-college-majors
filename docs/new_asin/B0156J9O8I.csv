So much so that after my son watched it with me, he promptly ""appropriated"" it and I now have to purchase another copy for myself.  Yes, it was a somewhat overly dramatic, but that actually added to its charm.  I found it refreshing to see so many strong women cast in this movie. The plot was very detailed and it was visually stunning from start to finish.  I cannot wait until the conclusion in 2016!",1450656000,10,467,4.333333333333333

7429156,4,B0156J9O8I,"The last time I wrote a review on the topic on this film I was subjected to Shiva's fury of angry responses.

Let me be clearer this time.

I like the film.  :-D

Also, I watched the film as a fun diversion.  I am not personally engaged in the on-going and consuming battle between Bollywood and the southern Indian film makers.

Also, this is not a commentary on religion in any way.

This is the story of how the Aryans came to power in ancient India as the time of the gods was coming to a close.

The special effects are impressive, and the stories are engaging and full of religious symbolism, e.g.,  a burning chariot.

The story has everything that western audiences have come to expect from films from India.  There are choreographed fight scenes set to music.  There are massive dance scenes set to music.  There is a scenery chewing villain.  There is a super powered hero that is betrayed by an ally.

My favorite part was the big fight scene near the climax of the movie.  The CGI was amazing.",1449964800,,1005,4.409836065573771

7429161,4,B0156J9O8I,"Though most cinephiles have long acknowledged southern Indias influential cinematic presence and increasingly high-profile production budgets, values, and box office, much of the outside world and even much of mainstream India never gave the non-Mumbai/non-Hindi industries the time of day, let alone expected anything like this. When I first watched the fantastic trailer for writer-director S.S. Rajamoulis Baahubali earlier this spring, I was impressed by the scale, scope, and alleged record-breaking budget of the feature; the narrative is stretched across two, 2.5 hour installments budgeted at $40 million in total, and tells the epic, Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) or Gladiator (2000)-sized tale (depending on your preference) of a reincarnated prince who, naturally, fulfills big destinies and saves his birthright kingdom from an evil usurper.

Though this first Baahubali installment features plenty of standard Indian cinematic trademarks for both good and ill (a long running time, over-the-top melodrama, a brilliant color scheme, and fantastic music), what sets it apart from most mainstream Hindi blockbusters as well as its South Indian brethren are the effectiveness of its action scenes, the prevalence of its digital effects, and overall solid storytelling and characterizations. Lets cover these one at a time, shall we?

First, the action sequences, when they stay relatively grounded and the camera avoids pulling back to reveal inconsistent CGI, are shockingly well done. Action scenes in Indian cinema, be they from Bollywood or wherever else, are typically terrible, but with recent successful films like Haider (2014), certain filmmakers seem to finally be taking them more seriously. This trend continues with Baahubali, where over-the-top slow-motion and gratuitous gore-effects work for the violence, rather than against it. Again, one needs to keep in mind that this story is more about fantasy and mythology than any sort of heightened realism or historical drama  think more 300 (2007) and less Rome (2007-2008)  but with that in mind, Rajamouli picks a tone and appropriate visual style and sticks to it, thank God, rather than chopping up all sorts of genres into a single hodgepodge of mass-audience pandering drivel.

Secondly, the films much ballyhooed and assuredly expensive digital effects are the biggest mixed-bag of the whole experience. There is no doubt that a film of this size requires a good amount of digital enhancement, and in many respects Baahubali draws much of its style and swagger from memorable CGI, but in just as many instances the overuse of the technology threatens to drag down the fun. Big, on-the-nose sequences like a ludicrous avalanche scene, a silly horse-drawn mecha-scythe machine in the finale, and even little effects like actress Ramya Krishnan holding a CGI baby above her head while standing in CGI water beg the question as to why simpler and assuredly cheaper practical options were not considered. Numerous parts of several action scenes, some minor while others major, are hindered by distractingly shaky and totally unnecessary digital effects.

To be sure, Baahubalis techno-wizardry is a far cry from the silly escapades of Aamir Khan in Dhoom 3 (2013), but its still a far cry from Hollywoods best. More and more Indian blockbusters are openly attempting to mimic Hollywood action franchises, but in doing so they are making all the same mistakes that overeager American tentpole features made in the early 2000s.

Back to the good stuff: Baahubali ultimately succeeds on the good ole fashioned basics of screenwriting and effective storytelling. Even with its more-than-competent action and terrific music, Baahubali wouldve been a bloated disaster if not for its solid characters and shockingly well paced narrative. For one, Baahubalis title character (Prabhas) and his supporting cast, including but not limited to the aforementioned Krishnan, Tamannaah, Rana Daggubati, and Sathyaraj, are all great; heroes are heroes and villains are villains, everyones motivations and character traits are crystal clear, and nobody feels like a robot or cartoon caricature (the latter especially notable for a big budget Indian production).

Whats more, Baahubali manages to justify its massive length and two-part division through epic scale and great pacing. The story unfolds confidently at its own pace, but nothing ever drags. Some of this is due to the frequency and quality of the musical numbers and action scenes, but much of the effective pacing simply derives from a good story. Baahubali is a genuinely good yarn and boasts great melodrama and political intrigue. Its not quite pure cinematic drama like a Mughal-e-Azam (1960) or a Haider, but its up there as far as high-concept blockbusters are concerned.

Lastly and what should come as no surprise at all, Baahubali has one of the best musical scores in years. Both its lyrical numbers and its background score are fantastic, so fantastic that I wish theatrical Indian releases wouldnt blast their sound so loud that I had to partially cover my ears throughout the entire showtime (Im not kidding). Baahubali boasts the musical potency and theatricality of a rock concert, thunderous and rousing during its most action-packed moments while soft, soothing, and melodic during its quieter ones. Visually speaking, the diverse musical numbers are perfectly choreographed to their tracks and shot such a way that every riff, chorus, hook, and verse reverberates with emotion and sensuality. You should nab the soundtrack right this minute! Why the heck aren't these numbers on YouTube?

Altogether, Baahubali is an unapologetic triumph for South Indian Cinema. In a national film culture that is routinely dominated or overshadowed by shallow Hindi melodramas, here we have a Telugu/Tamil melodrama that actually lives up to the bombastic hype. Its not perfect by any means given its never-ending inconsistent CGI, but at the end the day, that weakness just lowers the fun by a notch or two; it doesnt ruin the movie by any means. All the cartoony effects in the world cant ruin a great story and fun characters. :)

-

GRADE: B+

+ Baahubali comes down to the story, the emotions, and the characters when all is said and done. It has all three and therefore it works.

+ At this rate, SIC might surpass Bollywood in terms of cinematic violence, if it hasn't already; Rajamouli knows how to shoot an action-scene, at least when the computers don't get in the way. M.M. Keeravani and his various collaborating artists have musical soul for days, both in the eye-catching dance numbers and in the background score.

 Though much of the digital trickery is necessary and even quite competent at times, much of it isn't at all and just repeatedly, consistently, without fail takes away from the solid fantasy-adventure at this movies core.",1445040000,18,6873,5.297520661157025

Some people on here are nit-picking the CGI effects but I saw nothing wrong with it = its fantasy with a hero that has superpowers and not supposed to be completely realistic.

He then vow to help her free their enslaved queen. This movie has some singing and dancing but the story is still easy to follow. This is suppose to be part 1 of a 2 story film but when watching the movie it feels like it ends after the hero finds out were a comes from. the movie has a huge sub plot which in my opinion ends after the hero finds out who killed his real father but as far as know they are making a part 2 but this movie can stand on its own. I just want to add that their is a huge battle scene in the movie between 2 massive armies and it rivals anything that hollywood as done in recent films.

As an Indian expat who loves the Hollywood historical action epics, this was a dream come true to watch an Indian story be told in the same vein!",1453248000,,637,4.5964912280701755

My son (14 at the time) and I saw this in the movie theater when it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it.

It looks like both Holly and Bolly woods are going to have strong competition from Tollywood. It's great to see another strong film production center getting international play.

We bought the DVD so he could share it with his mom.

The only negative for us were some obvious racial connotations late in the movie. That was a bit jarring to American eyes used to a more balanced multi-cultural experience.",1453248000,9,618,4.590909090909091
7429222,1,B0156J9O8I,"After watching Bajrangi Bhaijaan and loving it, we thought we would give a try another Bollywood hit - apparently one of the highest grossing
Indian movies.

Well - proves that Indians are willing to pay money for something entirely different than the rest of the world, as we almost fell asleep from boredom!
After struggling to watch it for almost two hours, we just gave up - we actually did not finish watching, this is how excruciatingly boring and irritating at the same time was Bahubali.

Bahubali has mediocre actors staring in the dumbest plot movie ever, on the background of really, really bad computer graphics.
We've seen better digital effects around the time of Supermario!
It is not that India doesn't have talented actors, or movie directors, or good computer programmers.
but they certainly ran away from THIS project.
It is in the worst tradition of the Chinese flying kung-fu masters movies, but much, much worse.
Even the actor's makeup is horrible - the purble eyeshadow to on the face to show ""aging"", the pink circles around eyes to show ""crying""
aghrrr

It's a long move, about 3 hours almost, but is totally worth the watch. Bollywood may not be to everyone's taste, but I recommend this movie as it was my first experience with the genre and I loved it.
