1426889,5,B00005IBK9,"For those of us who fondly remember the Supermarionation series ""Thunderbirds"", the successor to that series is an even more stunning achievement.
With ""Captain Scarlet"", more than ever before viewers will find themselves forgetting that the puppets are not real actors, as they watch the action play out before them. Everything takes on a life of its own thanks to the vast improvements made over the relatively primitive ""Thunderbirds"" puppets.
The seriousness which marked the best offerings of the Gerry and Sylvia Anderson team can most likely be traced back to the influence of Sylvia Anderson. While ""Thunderbirds"" often leaned more towards Gerry's style of fun kid's show, ""Captain Scarlet"" leans more heavily on Sylvia's dramatic seriousness.
Fans of the much-maligned live-action Anderson series ""Space: 1999"" can well testify as to what could happen without Sylvia's input. In Year One of that program, the serious and metaphysical elements of sci-fi were in full force. Sadly, Gerry and Sylvia divorced between seasons, ending their collaberation. In Year Two, Gerry's solo version of "":1999"" was light, fun and campy, but it was also a huge disappointment compared to the serious drama supplied in Year One.
Happily, the pre-""Space: 1999"" ""Captain Scarlet"" has Sylvia on board, making for a dramatic program well worth remembering.
If you think this is just kid stuff, you would be quite incorrect. Strange for what was supposed to be a kid's show, people were routinely killed off by the evil Mysterons every week, and Captain Scarlet himself was originally a villain! The puppets, sets, effects, and overall production design of ""Captain Scarlet"" are far superior to ""Thunderbirds"", and more serious in tone.
The end result is a spooky, sometimes even gloomy, stylish sci-fi drama. If you dig the Andersons' work, ""Thunderbirds"", or 1960's futurism, you owe it to yourself to get this set and absorb this amazing series, ""Captian Scarlet"".",1024358400,3,1954,5.266025641025641
1426890,5,B00005IBK9,"Just a warning to others who may choose to get this set,

While the Thunderbirds is all about rescue and stuff, and enjoyed by millions of children.
Captain Scarlet is about killing and mayhem.
Children under the age of 15 might need supervision while watching this show.
If you are looking for more Gerry Anderson stuff for
children. Joe 90 and Stingray maybe better.
As an Australian i'm not sure if you can get these in the USA.

1426891,5,B00005IBK9,"After Thunderbirds, the next series Gerry Anderson created was Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.  With Captain Scarlet, Anderson was able to improve on his technique of Supermarionation.
  For those of you who don't know, Gerry Anderson's many TV series featured marionettes.  He developed a technique he called Supermarionation in which the puppets eyes could move and blink and the mouths could move in sync with prerecorded dialogue via electronics inside the puppets' heads.  One drawback in his early series though was that in order to accommodate the mechanisms the heads had to be oversize in proportion to the bodies.  But with Captain Scarlet he solved that problem and he developed puppets not only with perfect proportions but with finer facial features to make them more life-like.
  The series takes place hundreds of years in the future.  Deep space exploration is beginning, and humans have finally landed on Mars.  The explorers find that Mars is inhabited by a race called the Mysterons.  Unfortunately, first contact turns tragic, and a Mysteron city is accidentally destroyed.  The Mysterons declare war on humankind, and the Earth's main defense is the organization of SPECTRUM.  Headquartered in the airborn Cloudbase, and commanded by Colonel White, SPECTRUM's agents fight the Mysterons.  But their mission is not easy.  Not only are the Mysterons invisible, but also after they kill a human, they can reanimate their body and turn them into a Mysteron slave.
  But all is not lost.  SPECTRUM has their own tricks up their sleeves.  Their top agent, Captain Scarlet himself, was a former Mysteron zombie who regained his will.  Thanks to the Mysterons, Captain Scarlet is now virtually indestructible, making him the ideal choice for the most dangerous missions.
  Captain Scarlet ran for only one season.  Fortunately this DVD box set contains the whole season.  If you have the Thunderbirds sets, Captain Scarlet is a must!",1022025600,14,1949,5.212903225806452

1426969,5,B00005IBK9,"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons is a more serious, mature and altogether darker creation than Gerry Andersons earlier triumphs of sci-fi supermarionation from Supercar via Fireball XL5 and Stingray to the bigger-budget Thunderbirds. Great as these earlier series were, in Captain Scarlet new miniature-solenoid technology allowed the marionettes heads to be proportional to the bodies while the mouths and eyes were still moveable, so they look less like caricatures and more realistically human. Moreover the characters are realized as more thoughtful, complex and nuanced: the mysteron enemies sometimes win, the good guys often get it wrong, and almost every episode sees a character suffer a violent death prior to being reanimated by the mysterons in pursuit of their relentless terror-war against the human race.

The series is full of sinister double agents and James Bond-like plots, and it is tempting to see the Martian mysterons as an allegory for the Cold War Soviets. The indestructible Captain Scarlet (real name in the series = Paul Metcalfe) is the eponymous hero. Killed and resurrected by the mysterons to be used as one of their agents under neurological control, Metcalfes strength of character leads him uniquely to rediscover his moral compass and break the mind-control while retaining his mysteron regenerative powers, so he changes sides and re-joins SPECTRUM as their greatest asset in the war against the mysterons.

The series production values are so good that sometimes its easy to forget you're watching puppets, rather than actors. Although the original series dates from 1967 the storylines have a contemporary feel in that they deal with how to stop serial acts of terrorism and the effective deployment of actionable intelligence. Though the head of SPECTRUM is Colonel White (the SPECTRUM personnel have uniforms coloured according to their code names), and the sinister resurrected-from-death Captain Black remains under the control of the mysterons, the shows writers ensure the good guys and bad guys are not always painted as black-and-white: sometimes good people with the best intentions make poor decisions which result in disastrous consequences. This interplanetary war was instigated by us humans, albeit by mistake but one the mysterons do not and will not forgive.

The sets, SPVs and Angel fighter-aircraft (piloted by five exotic young women), the SPECTRUM uniforms, the spectacular Cloudbase as a kind of giant aircraft carrier in the stratosphere, special effects and pre-CGI-era explosions in each episode all look terrific and manage to be futuristic in that wonderful 1960s style while still being surprisingly ageless. Barry Grays atmospheric soundtrack is perfect, adding suspense and menace, and the end-credits of each episode showcase some superb comic-book action stills. The series however lacks the light touch and humour of Andersons earlier shows like Thunderbirds and Stingray; were in more serious film-noir territory here.

The 32 titled episodes from both series are offered on six differently coloured (SPECTRUM-style) DVDs, five containing the 32 episodes and the final DVD with extras. For purists: the image resolution is the original 1:1.33 (3:4) from the 1960s TV series, so has not been cropped to fit 21st century widescreen TV.",1468540800,2,3307,5.453125

1427083,5,B00005IBK9,"Captain Scarlett is another one of Gerry Anderson's creations (The Thunderbirds, Space 1999). I remember watching these episodes in my youth, and had a number of the futuristic vehicles as toys. This seemed to be one of the darker creations of Gerry Anderson partly because of the ominous Mysterons and their ability to clone humans, or anything for that matter. This created a strange and uncomfortable world in which one sometimes never really knew who were humans and who were aliens. In some ways it was perhaps a precursor to what the X-files had to offer. Captain Scarlett himself was duplicated by the Mysterons when his original self was killed in a car accident. Later he seems to have broken free of the Mysterons' influence even though he still retains superhuman abilities. Captain Scarlett, and an evil character named Captain Black, who has also been taken over by the Mysrterons, act as foils for each other. One representing good the other evil. All in all these episodes were very well conceived with stages built with an incredible amount of detail and ingenuity. This series was one of my favourites in my youth and it's still enjoyable to watch many years later.

The quality of these dvds is excellent as they appear to have been remastered. There are numerous bonus features, including spotlights on the puppets, the writing, and the directing. There is also an exclusive interview with Gerry Anderson, as well as some commentary tracks on two of the episodes.",1427241600,11,1482,4.928

1427087,5,B00005IBK9,"Probably the best Gerry Anderson Supermarionation series, some people may find it a little bit violent though",1425600000,2,109,5.470588235294118
1427088,5,B00005IBK9,"""Captain Scarlet"" is billed as a kid's show, but it is much more than that and can appeal to adults as well. It really does have some sophistication about it.  In fact, it was ahead of its time. It certainly has lasting appeal.

The show is action/adventure, with sci-fi elements. At the time of production (1968), secret agents were all the rage, and ""Captain Scarlet"" has more in common with the ""Man From Uncle"" than he does with something like ""Star Trek"". But there is sci fi --  some space trips (one to Mars that kicks off the series and later a trip to the moon and a return to Mars), and the vehicles and some sets are all very sci fi.

There are a few things that make this series stand out from the rest of Gerry Anderson's productions, maker it much more sophisticated, and which make this series well worth owning and watching:

1) The puppets look more realistic, and in proportion - something Anderson was very intent about. Think animated Barbie and Ken and you get the idea. Some of the facial sculpting is outstanding!
2) The musical soundtrack by Barry Gray is outstanding and extremely iconic of late 60's pop.
3) The costumes, designed by Sylvia Anderson, are based on fashions of the time yet go beyond (the caps with the pop down microphones are wonderful!) They are super.
4) The attention to visual detail in the miniatures and sets is absolutely brilliant!
5) The vocalizations, especially Francis Matthews' imitation Cary Grant for Scarlet, are excellent.
6) The vehicles are mind bogglingly clever. The SPV is driven while seated backwards - really! That IS clever, if disorienting.

There are also however, some drawbacks, but they make watching the series also entertaining:
1) The puppets are very stiff and hardly move, even the lips. There are technical reasons for this and it takes some getting used to. This kind of forces your imagination to fill in  where they cannot. Hard to explain, but it works.
2) The plots are - well - it's a kids show so they aren't challenging. And they've got less than 30 minutes to tell a complex story each time. However, over the series, the characters do grow on you and their lifestyle as members of SPECTRUM, a para military organization begins to have the same appeal as Star Trek's Federation and Star Fleet. This show NEVER talks down to the audience (as many kids shows do). It expects you to rise to its level.
3) It's very violent for a kid's show. At least one character dies in EVERY episode, and none too mercifully either! V for violence!
4) The bad guys, the alien Mysterons, are either idiots or the most helpful villains ever created. They announce their plans in every episode. No wonder they don't win. Also, their rage at humanity is out of bounds. For an advanced alien race, they could learn a little forgiveness. However, Anderson did a smart thing here. We never actually see them, so they are left to our imagination what they REALLY look like.
5) Because the puppets have such a difficult time moving, the action is quite stilted. They make up for it with camera moves, but it is still disorienting.
6) They LOVE blowing things up. Expect at least one disastrous explosion at least, in every episode.

One thing that has been pointed out is that it is a wonder that the character, Captain Scarlet, is able to remain sane. He dies such painful and horrible deaths, only to painfully recover and go through it all over again. Gotta feel sorry for the guy. He's indestructible, but not insensible. I am not sure how this makes kids feel. It bothers me as an adult.

Nevertheless, ""Captain Scarlet""  the show was groundbreaking for its time and is a must have for any Gerry/Sylvia Anderson fan. It has a quirky sophistication that was missing from the other puppet series, which were all, in their own way, entertaining and fun.

""Captain Scarlet"" is a serious departure, and apparently was quite successful. Don't let TV history pass you by, get this set and enjoy Anderson's vision of the future, with some of the most helpful villains ever created!",1424736000,,4041,4.669479606188467

1427090,5,B00005IBK9,"Captain Scarlett, the man the series is centered around, is a special Agent of Spectrum, sent to investigate any warning sent from the Mysterons from outer space, and their puppet, Captain Black. Scarlett's special ability? He can never die, no matter how severe the cause, as he has a secret that always brings him back to life. This is central to the series, as every episode revolves around Captain Scarlett's ability to find the danger and rescue anyone he can before time runs out with his right hand friend, Captain Blue.
The Mysterons begin each episode by first destroying, then replicating any ship or human they wish to manipulate. They are always unforgiving, and hold a strong grudge on the Earth for one serious mistake caused by one or two agents. Rather than negotiate, they seek the destruction of mankind and it's world president.
The puppet marionettes here are brilliantly controlled with nice articulation and features, with realistic faces and costumes. The personalities of each character are unique, and each contributes to the success of the show. Lots of story development, matched with plenty of sci fi action, space ships, take offs, landings, model ships, cars and landscapes in this excellent series from the late Gerry Anderson. Fans of realistic puppets won't want to miss this series. Also recommended: Thunderbirds, Terrahawks, Stingray, Supercar, Joe 90, etc...",1423958400,13,1395,5.176991150442478

1427152,5,B00005IBK9,"My beef with the DVD features is that the DVD ROM portion is missing the Mac files - even though the instruction file tells you how to use them!  Very shoddy work.  Somebody probably worked for months on the Mac version and then some guy went out on a bathroom break while the master was being made so it was all for nothing.

Not all that much to add to previous reviews.  If you are a Gerry Anderson fan this is a must have item.  Much darker and more adult than his other puppet shows.  For one thing the villains win in quite a few episodes and for another the whole mess is the fault of the imbecile trigger happy Earthlings who wreck a whole Martian city because they mistake a scanner being pointed at them for a weapon.  The Gerry Anderson commentary on how all the effects in the first episode were done are incredible.  Captain Blue flies his jet-pack under pylons and antennas; but he's a puppet!  Where are his strings?  The little tank zooms up a parking lot spiral ramp.  Once again - where'd they stash the strings?  The solutions are simple yet extremely creative and make you realise how much effort went into this show.

Love the peppy ending credits song about the hero getting killed all the time too.  The background paintings are of all his various gruesome deaths.  My favourite is him getting eaten by sharks.  Hmm, like to see how he regenerated from that one!

One thing that always fascinated me about this show was the unexplored SF aspects of the story.  For example just what the heck *is* the hero?  He's killed in the first episode.  For the rest of the series the protagonist is his mind stuffed into a copy that is somehow gotten its ""now make a copy from the destroyed original"" feature stuck: thus making him indestructible.  And immortal?  How does he feel about all this?  Human?  Why did this happen to him and not some of the other Mysteron duplicates?  In one of the associated merchandise books (but not in the series) it states that his last memory before his first death is of looking up from the wreck of his car at his duplicate self which would indicate that the Mysterons goofed and took the copy from the *dying* Captain Scarlet and thus sucked up his mind.  The other duplicates are from fresh corpses so are just physical copies with the memory but not the minds of their originals.  Once the controlling Mysteron leaves that leaves the original mind in control.

Also, why are the Mysterons so pissed about their destroyed city?  They had it backed up on tape (or something) and rebooted it within minutes.  Did they forget to do a timely backup so there's stuff missing?  Are the copies of the inhabitants somehow degraded and not perfect?  Maybe they all died and the whole war on Earth is just some automated revenge system.  Are they actually Martians or were they just visiting?  In the first episode they state that they're filled with the need to explore the universe so that suggests they've done some travelling.  The fact that there's only this one complex on a planet with nothing much in the way of an ecology seems to indicate that maybe the travelling was *to* Mars.  They originally refer to Earth as ""the third planet"" and you'd think that someone who grew up on Mars would have some other name for the twinkly blue star in their sky and their nearest neighbour - which they could see with even a crummy optical telescope in some detail.

Food for thought from a truly complex show premise.",1369526400,,3458,4.52827140549273
1427153,5,B00005IBK9,"Part I: For content, I am giving the set 5 stars.

Although I had access to Fireball and Stingray growing up, for some reason Captain Scarlet was not shown locally so this was all new for me. I had a blast watching it and highly recommend the show, especially if you liked the earlier series or the combination miniatures/full size sets with human actor shows that followed, UFO and Space: 1999.

Although filmed in Supermarionation, Captain Scarlet probably has more in common with UFO and Space: 1999 than the earlier Gerry Anderson shows with its more complex plots and graphic violence. The development of the puppets with more realistic proportions and an array of clever staging devices employed to eliminate much of the charming awkwardness of the earlier marionettes is also a notable aspect that the Gerry Anderson faithful will appreciate.

Like all Gerry Anderson shows you can count on top notch talent being employed for all aspects of the show including the writing, voice acting, miniatures, sound effects, and music. Fans of mid-century design will greatly appreciate the stylish interiors and often grandly futuristic architecture. The closing credit artwork is some of the most dynamic full-color comic illustration you may ever lay your eyes upon.

A few other things I really enjoyed:
-Captain Blue is voiced by Ed Bishop of UFO
-We get to hear Sylvia Anderson's voice portraying Melody Angel.
-The living dead Captain Black may have been the most mesmerizingly stylish villain to appear in any the Gerry Anderson series.

Unfortunately like UFO and Space: 1999 I think this show could have easily gone several more seasons. I guess like most other fans of Gerry Anderson shows we have to appreciate the wonders ITC made reality for us at the same time we want to throttle them for taking them all away far too soon.

Part II: For Disc Playback I have to give the set 2 stars.

This series is frustrating to play back but because I like the show so much I think it is worth the trouble. Particularly for the first and last episodes on each disc you may have to go through a few extra gyrations. However keep in mind that anything you can't trick your DVD/Blu-Ray player into playing can be watched without issue on your computer. That's a pain and generally something I would not be willing to put up with but as its the only way you are going to be able to see Captain Scarlet it is worth the extra effort in my opinion to have this little gem in my collection.

While this series, which followed on the heels of Thunderbirds, marks some technical improvement in Anderson's production techniques and does introduce darker elements which give his puppet universe more texture, the program remains for me perhaps the least involving and engaging of all his marionette efforts. I suppose it's largely because, for the most part, each episode is strategically structured the same. Moreover, the title character remains largely a cipher -- perhaps that's the intent. In any case, while I still recommend the series -- how could I not -- I would still rank it as inferior to Stingray and Thunderbirds, and despite its technical superiority to them, I even put it beneath Supercar and Fireball XL5.",1356652800,,834,5.0071942446043165

1427159,3,B00005IBK9,"Before buying this DVD release of ""Captain Scarlet - the Complete Series"" I read the previous reviews wherein some customers complained that the first and last episodes of each disc were note accessible for most DVD players. Since some did not complaint, I gave the set a try and ... the same problem appeared! I was on the verge of returning the product when I read the review of rdmx saying that both current releases of the series have the same problem. Therefore I spend nearly two hours trying to access the problematic chapters of each disc and found that is is indeed possible to view the aforementioned chapters! I want to share my experience in the hope that it might be useful for other customers . I have a very basic Sony DVP-SR110 player, so I think that the trick might work for other players as well. To access the first episode of the last three discs you select the episode and then the menu with the chapters of each episode is displayed. When I press the ""play"" button the screen goes to the appearance it has when the disc is first loaded. Then immediately press ""play"" again and you can view the first episode of the disc. To view the last episode you first access the last chapter of the immediate precedent episode. Then from the players remote control press the ""next chapter"" button and you are positioned into the first chapter of the last episode. For the very first episode of the first disc (""The Mysterons"") the aforementioned trick for the first chapters didn't work, but fortunately you can access it by going to the bonus material section of the disc and select the option to view the episode with Gery Andersons's commentary. Then the player gets you to the unaccessible episode. If the commentary is not desired it can be turned off with the ""audio"" button of the remote control and you can view the episode as if it were accessed form the main menu. Of course, all this trouble is if you want to view the disc in your TV set; in the computer the discs runs shamelessly. I hope that this information can be useful to other customers that, as I, are bitterly disappointed of the bad quality of this A&E release.

But, unlike the Thunderbirds a lot of detailed puppetry and scenes were created to comprise some very well done episodes of this series.  My only reason for not giving it 5 full stars is that the producers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson didn't bother to make this hour long episodes, unlike the Thunderbirds.  So, no sooner do you start getting into a story, then its over and ended far to soon.

In my opinion, if Saturday morning cartoons brought back Supermarionettea stories again, especially with the kind of special effects that can be added to enhance the graphics they would be Saturday morning blockbusters. No matter the age of a child or the year in which they were born, children love puppets and especially marionettes.

1427207,5,B00005IBK9,"In 1967, Gerry & Sylvia Anderson created another of their wonderful sci-fi TV series using puppets (referred to as ""Supermarionation"") for the characters.  The futuristic, sci-fi plot of this series takes place circa 2068, approximately 100 years ahead of the time that the series was produced.  The first episode begins with a human mission to Mars, lead by the characters Captain Black (voice of Donald Gray), Captain Scarlet (voice of Francis Matthews) and Captain Brown (voice of Charles 'Bud' Tingwell).  Looking rather dark and bleak as they drive their vehicle on the Martian surface, they happen across a brightly-lit, alien-constructed base.  The aliens, calling themselves the Mysterons, are curious about the humans and turn cameras to gaze more closely at the visitors, but Captain Black mistakes the cameras for weapons and opens fire.  Destroying the Mysteron base, the base suddenly starts to be resurrected by a mysterious light.  The light originates from the Mysterons' greatest technological accomplishment: the ability to resurrect not only destroyed objects, but dead beings as well.  The Mysterons, now resurrected, take over the minds of Captain Black, Captain Brown and Captain Scarlet.  Unbeknownst to their agency, known as Spectrum, the trio are under orders to take vengeance upon Earth for the attack on the Mysteron Martian base.  However, Spectrum, with its Cloudbase (essentially an airborne, hovering aircraft carrier), Angels (fighters manned by female pilots) and other agents, including Captain Blue (voice of Ed Bishop) and Colonel White (voice of Donald Gray), is able to combat the Mysterons and capture Captain Scarlet who regains his human mind, but is, thanks to the Mysterons, virtually indestructible.

Over the course of the 32-episode series, Spectrum occasionally discovers secrets about the Mysterons that help them foil more Mysteron attacks, but Spectrum is not always successful in stopping the Mysterons and their guerrilla-style warfare, which could also be described as terrorism.  The Mysterons, feeling a strong sense of superiority, go so far as to inform Spectrum and the world what their next attack is going to be, giving Spectrum time to act.  Overall, the series was very good and deserves a rating of 4.5 (rounded to 5) out of 5 stars.  The series did have a few flaws, though, such as Captain Scarlet sounding too much like Cary Grant, Spectrum not always recognizing easily-identifiable security flaws, and the knowledge that the Mysterons are going to use their same modus operandi.  People familiar with other Gerry & Sylvia productions will no doubt recognize similarities between the music & sound effects of this show with earlier & later Anderson productions.  Also, anyone familiar with the Anderson's 1970, live-action, sci-fi TV series ""UFO"" will recognize that the actor who did the voice for Captain Blue, Ed Bishop, played the main character of Commander Ed Straker in ""UFO"".",1200182400,2,2952,5.345572354211663

 I changed the last line or so.. but its true.... the show plods along with the enemy ""Mysterons"" from Mars ( dumb ) giving away their plans at the start of each episode.. still the models are fun and puppets die all the time, sometimes horribly... so it's an ok ride when there is nothing else to watch.",1167091200,,1302,4.725663716814159
1427209,5,B00005IBK9,"What a delight it is to find this series available in DVD format!  As a kid, I fondly recall watching this syndicated program after school along with a co-installment of that popular Japanese import, ""Ultra Man"" on KTVU Channel 2, right  here in the SF Bay Area.

As a kid, I thought ""Ultra Man"" was downright silly with some guy in a scuba suit (you could clearly see the zipper running along the back!) spray painted silver and wearing a cheap plastic helmet stomping about a miniature set of Tokyo, but it was the technical brilliance of ""Captain Scarlet"" that I recall most of all. The extras to this DVD set are nice, but hardly generous-mostly still frame catches of the individual puppets and some behind-the-scenes shots. In my opinion, the commentary by Anderson was expected and is most welcome.

I marvelled at the genius of Gerry Anderson and the technicians who created these puppets so lifelike, it was downright creepy, but in a fascinating way.  Each puppet or character was distinctive from the others and so detailed that the puppetters who made them spared no detail--even adding a five o'clock shadow to the face of our hero and substituting, for instance, a close up a human hand when specific objects needed to be grasped or held.

Unlike most progamming aimed at children, Captain Scarlet was decidedly mature and serious.  It was not uncommon to see a puppet actually killed, burned or ""bleeding""--not your typical programming aimed at children. Unusual, to say the least. Of course, CGI was unheard of then, but the use of miniatures of various scales and the special effects were impressive for the day and far more realistic-looking than those seen on ""Stingray"" or ""The Thunderbirds.""  The two series that would follow, ""Secret Service"" and the popular ""Joe 90,"" would later capitalize on these advancements in ""Supermarionation"" seen in Captain Scarlet.

The stories (approximately 25-30 mins in length), were as interesting as they were entertaining.  I think I finshed viewing the entire set in about two or three evenings, and I am looking forward to viewing my set of ""Secret Service"" soon.",1152144000,6,2123,4.938202247191011

1427231,5,B00005IBK9,"""Captain Scarlet"" (1967 - 32 episodes), is a brilliant production of the English couple Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, of ""Thunderbirds"", responsible for the Supermarionation technique that used plastic marionettes operated by fine threads of nylon. The plot starts in 2068 when the Spectrum organization - responsible for the world-wide peace - was making research in the Mars planet and, without thinking, attacks the base of the Mysterons. The attitude causes a great misunderstanding since the aliens were pacific. Hurt, they swear to destroy the human civilization for judging us maleficent and dangerous.

After being dominated by the Mysterons, Captain Scarlet - the one direct responsible for Mars exploration - managed to revert the process and becomes immortal. The humanity had sufficient evolved to elect a world-wide president and Captain Scarlet was charged to protect him of the terrible attacks of the Mysterons. Main agent of the Spectrum, he will use his powers to fight against the powerful extraterrestrial race that has the power to invade and to take control of the body of the human beings.",1128211200,3,1109,5.301136363636363

UFO fans will recognize the voice of Captain Blue as Ed Bishop.  It's also somewhat uncanny that a show written 40 years ago about the Mysterons ""war of nerves"" against mankind is not unlike the present-day threat of terrorism.

1427234,3,B00005IBK9,"I'm a 30 year old that didn't really grow up with this stuff.  After seeing Team America: World Police, my life sort of changed and I couldn't  get enough.  Since the movie hasn't come to DVD yet, I had to get my fill elsewhere and what better place to start than the puppet world of Gerry Anderson.

  After being impressed with the Thunderbirds, I stepped into further unknown territory with the Captain Scarlet DVD set.
Gerry Anderson pushed the envelope even further with more realistic puppets and more sophisticated gadgets.  There are lots of well thought out storylines and scenarios and the hard work that went into the sets and overall craftmanship is undeniable.
  I have to say there are some elements that are a little annoying about the episodes.
  Other than minor goofy 60s quirks, I really like the series.  My personal favorites are 'The Mysterons', 'Renegade Rocket', 'Seek and Destroy' (which has some pretty impressive dog fight sequences with the Angels jets!) and 'Operation Time' which has a pretty cool storyline twist.  It is kind of interesting to note that some of the puppets are revamps on different stories, with different clothing and hairstyles.
  One thing that I noticed that could be a plothole is that if Captain Scarlet retained the powers of retrometabolism(meaning that he has superhuman healing powers), how come the mysteron agents aren't invincible.  They get shot, thrown from buildings, catch on fire... and THEY don't come back.  Are they just merely Mysteron pawns?  Are Captain Black and Scarlet the only ones with this supernatural gift? Hmmmm..  It's good that Captain Scarlet is invincible because he really isn't all that great with a gun and he does get himself killed countless times, ACCIDENTALLY.  And I can't understand why the Mysterons seem to want to 'spill the beans' about where they will attack next.  The 'Voice of the Mysterons' broadcasts the threat over spectrum's radios! Not very bright are they?
  Still, the series are fun to watch.  I am about half way through the DVD set.  Just remember, even though it takes place in the future, it is still very 60s!  People drive around in 65 Rivieras and the phones have cords on them.. CORDS!  hehe.  And not to mention,  there are plenty of AWESOME EXPLOSIONS.",1100563200,7,2273,4.907894736842105
1427235,5,B00005IBK9,"Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!

I was (and still am) a huge fan of the ""Thunderbirds"" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes!

The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The ""Angels"" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series!

Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child!

As in real life, the good guys don't always win nor always make the best decisions but, fortunatly, our hero Paul Metcalf AKA Captain Scarlet returns for the next episode!

1427237,5,B00005IBK9,"Since I was riveted by this show as a kid, I thought my own two sons ages 6 & 9 might enjoy it. We were all captivated! The supermarionation techniques were much refined by this series, and you won't see the troublesome ""big heads"" and exposed wires as on Thunderbirds. Captain Scarlet's storylines are a bit serious, much cold-war angst and very James Bondish. Count on the best of impecible British manners from all the SPECTRUM gents! Each of the captains has unique character qualities as well as colored boots to match their vests... even the kids will not lose track of who's who. Too bad there was little effort made to distinguish personalities of the 5 female pilots, known as the the ""angels"", other than their being each a blond, redhead, brunette, and gratuitously thrown in, an Asian and African-American. Usually the Angels seem to simply hang about the modernistic lounge, reading magazines and filing their nails, while awaiting the next assignment. You'll have to count on the male forces of SPECTRUM to provide all the intrigue.
In the episode ""Craterville 101"", watch for normally reserved Captain Green to enigmatically blurt out ""Do I get a coconut?"", when he is being praised by his fellows, Captain Scarlet and Blue for having just destroyed a Mysteron aggressor tractor! This caused a huge laugh and it is now an often used family statement.

The residents of the city are the Mysterons. An invisible race that now declares war on the inhabitants of Earth. After they destroy Captain Black and his team, the Mysterons use their powers to re-create Captain Black and set out to lay waste to mankind. The Mysterons are able to recreate anyone and everything they destroy. Their first target is the President of the World Government. Captains Scarlet and Brown, agents of the Global protection agency SPECTRUM are en route to provide protection for the President, but before they arrive, they are killed by the Mysterons. Their perfect replacements pick up where they left off and escort the President to the World Government HQ. Once there Captain Brown attempts to kill the President but to no avail. Captain Scarlet also tries but is shot by Captain Blue and plummets 800 feet to what is sure to be his death. Amazingly, Captain Scarlet recovers from his injuries and becomes Spectrum's most valuable agent in the fight against the Mysterons!
September of 1967 saw the introduction of Gerry Anderson's most adult oriented and easily most ambitious series to date. Unlike Stingray and The Thunderbirds Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons introduced graphic violent content including the deaths of several characters in each episode. Anderson has been a staple of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for almost 40 years. In that time he has produced twenty series, five of which made it to American Television (XL5 in 1963, Thunderbirds in 1994 and Space 1999, UFO and Captain Scarlet in the 1970's). One of the hallmarks of Anderson's series was the use of something called ""Supermarionation"". Essentially, the coolest puppets in the world coupled with the coolest miniature sets, made children's imaginations run wild, not too mention bringing their wildest dreams to life. In the Stingray, and the Thunderbirds series, the heads of the marionettes were clearly out of proportion to their bodies, which while not distracting did give a more fanciful look to the production. In Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons the process of Supermarionation was perfected in that the heads of the puppets could now be made proportionally correct as the solenoid chips (computer controlling elements that controlled the synchronization of the mouths of the puppets with the dialogue) that were once housed in the heads of the puppets were now small enough to fit in the chest cavity of each marionette. Given the current improvements the puppets were now 1/3rd human scale. Newer problems however, arose, as these new ""stringless"" puppets controlled from the bottom of the stage as opposed to the ceiling could not be made to walk convincingly. The problem was fixed by the incorporation of moving sidewalks, differing camera angles and the addition of sounds of movement. I.E. shoes ""clicking"" on pavement. Supermarionation was a resounding success and Captain Scarlet went on to become one of Anderson's highest rated entries. A&E has again put together a fabulous multi-disc (four) entry. Available in the U.K. for some time, on PAL encoded VHS and recently DVD, Captain Scarlet has finally made it to America and in the best shape since its original run.
The original soundtrack for Captain Scarlet is included as well as a beefed up DD5.1 platform. The 5.1 presentation is on par with that of the platform for the Thunderbirds. The surrounds are used for both atmospheric and directional movement and the sub tends to be very active. The dialog is all very clear and easily understood. There are two commentary tracks provided by series creator Gerry Anderson. The first is on the pilot episode ""The Mysterons"" and the second is on the 30th episode entitled ""Attack on Cloudbase"". The commentaries sound scripted and tend to fall on the dry side. They're informative but not very interesting.
The video is presented in its original 1:33.1 full frame. The colors are all rich and vibrant. Black levels are good and saturation levels are good. There are a few moments of artifacting throughout the series but they don't at all detract from the visual presentation.
The extras included on the discs are photo galleries, character bios, vehicle guides and SPECTRUM ID cards for all of the Spectrum agents including Captain Black and DVD-ROM interactive vehicle diagrams. 32 episodes in all, Captain Scarlet has been never before been made available on this side of the pond. The ""truest treat"", if you will, is this domestic release of the entire series.
As a kid this was always my favorite TV show. Now that they have finally landed in Region 1 in a most handsome 4-DVD set, I am ecstatic! While there is word that Captain Scarlet is being brought into the 21st century via a new CGI series, it will be hard pressed to equal the sheer joy and delight these programs have offered. The storylines are cohesive and the presentation makes for wonderful viewing!",1063584000,20,5047,5.038277511961723

""Supercar,"" the most primitive of the above (It was made in 1958-59) is a delight because it is an early children's show (of my youth) beautifully transferred to DVD. Captain Scarlet is technically amazing. The marionettes have been perfected to look more human. The vehicles, crafts, and special effects are slick and convincing. My problem with this series is that it is so, so serious. The earlier series could be enjoyed by anyone, not just sci-fi nuts. 'Captain Scarlet"" has all of the ponderous heaviness of the worst of sci-fi movies. The earlier series were human and you coudl tell that the humans behind them were having fun. ""Captain Scarlet"" never lightens up. Watching it, I feel as if the series was hijacked by technically skilled robots instead of humans. Gerry Anderson was divorcing his wife and partner, Sylvia, at this period. She was th eone responsible for the character stylizations.

Their vision and magical ability to breathe life into fiber glass is still a monumental pain staking task to say the least.  Even today this scifi series ""Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons"" stands the test of time for entertainment, special effects and delightful color.
Summary - Captain Scarlet for 32 amazing episodes battles the invisible ""Mysterons"" a Martian race who was mistakenly attacked by Spector (Scarlets military organization).

1427261,5,B00005IBK9,"In his commentary track on ""The Mysterons""--the pilot episode for the series--series co-creator Gerry Anderson remarks that in today's dollars, ""Captain Scarlet"" would cost the equivalent of three-quarters of a million dollars an episode to produce.
You can see it.
The dedication to quality in this series is nothing short of amazing: the miniature sets include shielded gun emplacements, moving sidewalks, and entire city skylines, and the special effects undoubtedly had some of the Hollywood masters scratching their heads, wondering how Anderson and his crew managed it. As realistic as it seems, though, you can never quite forget you're watching marionettes, but Anderson makes that work FOR the show rather than against it: with complete control over the construction of Scarlet's world and every ""person"" in it, the crew had the skill and foresight to create a consistent, substantial feel, resulting in a show that is engrossing, visually compelling, and sometimes downright creepy.
On the surface, it looks like a four-color superhero show for children, which probably led to its downfall: the show explores themes too sophisticated for most children using plots that are often too byzantine for casual adult viewers--""Captain Scarlet"" requires the sort of dedicated attention only children seem to be capable of these days. Adults will dismiss the show (or embrace its kitsch value) because of the puppetry and obvious miniatures. As good as this show is, it could never have found a wide viewing audience.
But, artistically, it does succeed, and magnificently. The cheesiness of previous Anderson Super-marionation series is minimized in favor of a more realistic, dramatic tone. Take away the rainbow uniforms and code names and you've got a legitimate spy series that focuses on preventing terrorism and assassination attempts, and engages in elaborate manhunts and undercover missions.
This is truly the gem in the Andersons' crown...the show that legitimized their efforts to create drama using the most unlikely approach. Without ""Captain Scarlet,"" there would have been no ""UFO"" or ""Space: 1999.""",1047600000,,2115,5.451219512195122

The first time I saw it was when my grandfather bought me a transtlated to Hebrew video cassete of two episodes when I was 5. Since then I didn't get the chance to see any other episodes. Today, 14 years later, it arrived to the TV here, and I LOVE it, I watch it every day! It's a cool program, a lot better that 'Thunderbirds' (That is also on here, but I don't watch it.)
The great stroyline and the general coolness of the program cover some basic naivity and a couple of lousy effects, yet the idea to show the mysterons as circeles of light is geniuse.
I wouldn't say it is ""A Must"" some of you out there might find it silly, boring and unrealistic in today's world of fast action, amazing computer effects and the fact that we know that there are no Mysterons on Mars.

1427264,5,B00005IBK9,"In the post-9/11 world, how do you educate kids about certain ugly realities in a not-unsettling  -  and even genuinely entertaining  -  manner?  Why, with Captain Scarlet, of course.  I recently re-watched this entire series, and was amazed how relevant it's suddenly become.  Of all Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's kid's puppet shows, this was always the most adult, and now more than ever performs remarkably well.
Set in 2068, the series story concerns man's first landing on Mars, where expedition leader Captain Black misunderstands a friendly overture from the locals  -  the ubiquitous but never-seen ""Mysterons""  -  and orders a destructive strike on one of their cities.  The Mysterons are not amused.  With their superior technology, they can reconstruct any destroyed person or object for their own purposes, and they use this ability to engage Earth Defense Forces (called Spectrum, whose members go by color-coded secret names) in an ongoing terrorist war of nerves.  From episode to episode, the Mysterons begin by announcing in Tokyo Rose style what their next intended target will be, and Spectrum applies its resources to preventing the coming attack.  Title character Captain Scarlet is the only man upon whom Mysteron takeover has failed, leaving him with the unique ability to regenerate from nearly any otherwise fatal wound and making him Earth's best single defense against the invisible threat of the Mysterons.
This is a beautifully produced show, especially given that its primary audience is kids.  It broaches the ugly subject matter of terrorism in the best of all possible ways, which is to emphasize courage, companionable solidarity, and good moral human values in opposing it.  Ironically, it also doesn't paint the protagonists and antagonists entirely in black-and-white terms, but maturely demonstrates that bad decision making even on the part of good people  -  or nations  -  can have disastrous consequences.
But best of all, Captain Scarlet isn't so simplistic that the adults won't enjoy it too.  It's gorgeous to look at, and is surprisingly entertaining  -  for all ages, in different ways.",1031356800,40,2131,5.255192878338279
1427265,5,B00005IBK9,"What a fantastic set.  All of the episodes of Captain Scarlet in one set and restored to near perfection!  BBC Resources restored the episodes for a 2001 TV run and the restored masters were used for the DVD releases in the US and the UK.  These look far more sharp and colorful than the ones run on the SciFi channel a few years ago. The sound is great, and includes a new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, which isn't too bad.  Being a purist, I prefer the original, mono soundtrack.
The extras included, for the most part, are pretty good, except for the photo gallery section, which consists of screen grabs from various episodes.  There is a very nice production photo section, though, which shows a lot of the things that happened behind the scenes.  The vehicle diagrams are great, too.
2 episodes, the pilot 'The Mysterons' and one of the last episodes, 'Attack on Cloudbase'. have commentary by the series co-creator, Gerry Anderson. Gerry isn't very exciting to listen to, but his commentaries are very informative. Gerry, for the most part, gives credit where credit is due to such people as Barry Gray, who composed the music and Derek Meddings, who did the visual effects work.  However, he gives no credit or even acknowledges the work of his ex-wife, Sylvia.  She co-created the show with him and did many female charater voices, too.  The bio of Gerry Anderson refers to a 'bitter divorce' from Sylvia in 1975.  I realize that many people never completely heal, emotionally and in other respects, after a divorce.  However, I think it is rotten for Gerry to completely ignore Sylvia's contribution to the series.
Another thing that I should note is that A&E put the episodes on the discs in a random order.  They didn't use the original transmission order or Carlton Media's recomended broadcast order.  Not a big deal for the most part, at least they did put the 1st episode first on disc one.  However, there is a trilogy of stories about the Mysterons on the moon, the first of which is on disc 2 and the other 2 on disc 3.  The first episode of the 3, 'Lunarville 7' is fine on disc 2. The other two are in reverse order on disc 3, with the last episode of the trio, 'Dangerous Rendezvous' being on the disc before the second one, 'Crater 101'.  Watch 'Crater 101' first, as 'Dangerous Rendezvous' refers to events that happen in 'Crater'.
'Scarlet' is my favorite Supermarionation series.  Not a boring episode in the lot.  Very exciting and different from anything that has come before, or since. I like the fact that the Spectrum people don't come out on top every time.  The show's realism is one of its strong points.
A nice companion to this set, which is available elsewhere on Amazon, is the book 'The Complete Captain Scarlet' by Chris Bentley. The book goes in to a lot of detail about the series, including an episode guide, behind the scenes stories, information about 'Scarlet' merchandise', and stills from a 4 minute CGI pilot for a new Captain Scarlet series which might hit TV screens in 2004.
I think A&E made a wise choice in releasing these in one set, as Captain Scarlet didn't enjoy the same popularity as Thunderbirds in the US. This set is missing some of the extras that were on the British DVDs, but A&E would have had to make this a 5 disc set to include everything that was in that set. ...",1029628800,68,3326,4.5972927241962775

I rarely saw the show when it was on the Sci-Fi Channel, so I'm glad the whole series is on DVD now. It's more violent than other Supermarionation shows, but it was more realistic, showing that Spectrum could fail to stop the Mysterons as well as stop them. I wholly recommend this DVD set not only for the old time fans like me, but also for people who never saw the series before.",1026259200,9,636,4.491379310344827
1427269,5,B00005IBK9,"You can estimate a Englishman's age (if he's over 35) by the Gerry Anderson series he best remembers.  For me, that's Captain Scarlet.  Of course, I remember Thunderbirds and Stingray as prime examples of the art of Supermarionation but here, with Captain Scarlet, the Anderson team finally sorted out the solenoid problem and created puppets with correctly proportioned heads.  The storylines are intriguing, the gizmo's - out of this world and the voice talent top-notch.  For a 42 year-old, this is the definitive moment in Anderson-lore.  Buy it!  Love it!  There'll never be anything better!",1025654400,3,596,5.2105263157894735

I had the Dinky Die Cast Vehicles that were only available at FAO Schwarz.
Some 35 years later it still is cool!
Wish they included extras like 1967 Kellogs commercials, CGI Pilot(s), and the BBC cult tv promo's.
and more behind the scenes stuff.
Buy the book too!",1025222400,5,406,4.5

7938398,3,B00005IBK9,"As a kid I loved this series probably more than ""Thunderbirds"" as it came out right at that Apollo mission peak in 1967 through 1968. I even had the Corgi SPV vehicle and the plane the female pilots flew. But I guess childhood memories are better than adult realities. The series is kind of hard to watch in 2017 as although the sets are still fantastic as are the pretty cool and what seem spectacularly realistic explosions, I found the voice actors way too stiff. They seem to have no inflection in their voice of surprise or fear like they came out of a British lab where they thought American military speak was this unwaveringly without any emotion.

Loads of stuff I noticed made no sense. What the what is ""international time"" they refer to? Why do all the female pilots have stripper names (Destiny, Symphony, Rhapsody, Melody and Harmony) and did Quentin Tarantino steal his Reservoir Dogs' crime crew's names from the Spectrum male staff (Captain Scarlet, Blue, White, Black, Ochre (Ochre?), Magenta, Grey and Lieutenant Green)? Why does Captain Scarlet sound like Cary Grant but looks like Ashton Kutcher? What is ""S.I.G."" mean when the members sign off on the coms? When the puppets die why are they so stiff (yeah, they are ""stiffs"" but bodies go limp when they get blown up or shot)? Why such ridiculously overexplained plot points? Lastly, the most hilarious line is ""This is a red alert not a stroll around the deck--Move!"" delivered in a monotone to the female pilots by the jet white-haired dude.

Anyway, a few episodes are about all I can handle without getting bored to death. Also, the voice of the Mysterons is so silly as well as the rings of light that float into scenes as they speak.

The bonuses on the DVD do help. There are commentary tracks. Interviews with the creator Gerry Anderson who tells a great story of how SuperMarionation began but it needed actual film clips of these old puppet shows pre-Thunderbirds he talks about, the director, one of the puppeteer and the best Canadian Shane Rimmer on the scriptwriting.",1519948800,,2053,4.745098039215686

7938400,5,B00005IBK9,So far I've only seen the first episode but I really like this show. Great graphics and story line. I especially like that for once humans are shown for what they really are the bad guys. The earth attacked first so from here on no matter what happens humans deserve what they get.
