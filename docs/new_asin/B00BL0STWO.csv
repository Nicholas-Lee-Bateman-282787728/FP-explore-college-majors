5636732,5,B00BL0STWO,"An inspiring story, especially if you know Band of Brothers.  Really enjoyed it. Dick Winters was a truly great man.",1389139200,,116,4.8
5636733,5,B00BL0STWO,"Do you know who Dick Winters was and what he represents? If you do, this is an excellent presentation that combines both visual and audio. If you don't, take this opportunity to learn!

This is a well narrated presentation about Dick Winters and the statue commissioned to represent his leadership and courage on D-Day. He understood responsibility to those under his command and for this he earned their respect. The interviews and photographs add a very personal dimension. Follow the designing of the statue to the ceremony commemorating all that he represented. Many in Normandy still honor the memory of the Americans who fought and died during the D-Day invasion.  This is not a simplistic documentation but a story well told.

Definitely recommended for those with an interest in military history and for students who wish to learn. Learn about both military history and about the qualities needed in leadership skills!

5636909,5,B00BL0STWO,"What an honor to feel a part of history from not so long ago. This entire series Band of Brothers and additional DVD's are so well worthwhile watching. World War 2 was never taught much in high school for baby boomers such as I. It was too close and the pain too deep. But in all... the truth, what the allied soldiers  fought for, the unity, the devastation, the injustice, the horrors, the heroes, the bonding and compassion, the understanding in the aftermath... are a piece of reality that the world needs to know and attempt to experience. We need to see the truth, from men who lived it, as is so well documented here. This is an excellent series and one that everyone should see as a summary of the facts.. It should be part of high school curriculums and introduced as an honor to watch. May we forever pay tribute to all those brave men and women who have served our country then and now. This series is astonishing! Thank you to all those who made it possible! It is so much appreciated and a true ""eye-opener"" for those who have wanted facts for so long.",1437868800,,1065,4.378787878787879

Gave it only four stars because the original troopers -- as well as others who spoke directly about Dick -- were not identified, other than by their WWII portraits, while they were speaking about him and their experiences.  Recognized ""Babe"" H by his jacket name, but could not figure out who the others were.  Who was the American in the dark suit with the small CIB on his lapel speaking at the dedication of the monument?  He looked so familiar...",1430956800,2,676,4.694915254237288

5636951,1,B00BL0STWO,"Like so many shows, this one just drones on and on before actually getting to the point.  All in all, I'd have to give it poor marks from a production standpoint.  Content is a different story.  This is the story of a guy who personified ""The Greatest Generation"" and the subject of this show made it hold me.

5636982,5,B00BL0STWO,"Dick Winters was the epitome of that generation. He was not only humble, but served his company and country with honor! This man had a 6th sense to quickly respond to any crisis and orders thrown his way! The irony is that he lived a quiet life after the war and never bragged about his feats! What a biography!

I would certainly recommend this to any young military officer or NCO as well as those leading people in business.

8570091,5,B00BL0STWO,"Having visited the American Cemetery at Normandy four (4) times since 2010, I always walk away with a deep emotional gratitude to those men of the greatest generation who gave so much of themselves.  Have yet to visit the Dick Winters Memorial, but hope to summer of 2018.

When one walks through Normandy, Luxembourg and Arlington National Cemetery..the thoughts of duty, honor country, loyalty and dedication seem much more than words..but, rather ideals based on liberty and justice.  And for those ideals, men have paid a terrible price for not having the opportunity to mature with families and children..nor never to see another sunset.

Somehow in this day and age, these ideals seem to be vanquished on other matters.  But, to those who walked before us..and to those who gave so much..we thank you and will never forget.
