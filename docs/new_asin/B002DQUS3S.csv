8365971,4,B002DQUS3S,I thought this was a very well done history of the navy from the time of Peter the Great forward.  I was particularly impressed by its treatment of Russian naval strategy and tactics in the pre-Soviet era. I like the presentation on the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Tsushima Straits.,1383523200,,291,4.705882352941177
8365972,5,B002DQUS3S,A very good job done by the History channel on this DVD. It covers the history of the Russian Navy from the 17th century to the mid 2000s. On some subjects they just touch the surface leaving you with questions but overall they did a good job covering this subject. Many early battles are talked about including Peter The Great and how he put together one of the world's most feared navy at that time. Highly recommended for all Soviet/Navy fans.,1346630400,,446,4.518518518518518
8365973,5,B002DQUS3S,This Video was done by the History Channel. This was an Excellent Video. Presented very well. I learned a lot of information that I did not know. When I was in the Navy. I would recommend This Video.,1284422400,,199,4.2631578947368425
8365974,3,B002DQUS3S,"Well, maybe 3.5 stars. This documentary is not bad...as far as it goes.  The first part focuses on the development of the Russian Navy and the enormous impact Peter the Great had on both ship design, construction and naval strategy that turned Russia into a sea power. Major milestones in Russian navy history are then chronicled, albeit in a broad-brush or cursory fashion so I was left wanting for more on the Russo-Japanese war, the revolution, and WW2. I concede, however, it's tough to cram 300+ years of history into a 90 minute video!

The program fell apart somewhat during the Cold War era by giving too much time to Russia's submarine fleet (no offense to the submariners out there) at the expense of the surface fleet.  Admittedly, Russia's submarine fleet was/is huge, but very little was said about most major suface combatants except for abbreviated acknowledgement (and video footage) near the very end of the program of the ""Peter the Great"" cruiser and the ""Kuznetsov"" aircraft carrier.  And virtually no mention is made of most other ship types or Russia's naval air arm.

My only other complaint is the lack of archival footage..particularly from the World War 2 and the Cold War.  I would have gladly traded some of the re-enactor scenes used throughout (particularly in the early history phase) for more footage of the ships in action.

In short, not bad but not great and an OK purchase for anyone with an interest in the Russian/Soviet Navy.
