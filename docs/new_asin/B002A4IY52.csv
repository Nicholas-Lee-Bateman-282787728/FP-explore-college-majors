8358917,4,B002A4IY52,"Ironic title, considering at least 2 fighters suffered serious arm breaks in this lead up show to the pfc absolute tournament.
Serious fighting spirit is on display in these david vs goliath matches. Werdum Quinton and Tamura didn't show as much spirit as some of the other fighters this night but it was one of the better #'d events.",1310428800,,334,4.677966101694915
8358918,4,B002A4IY52,"Aside from the actual event, this DVD also contains the pre-fight interviews, fighter walk-ins, and post-fight interviews. The pre-fight interview segment lasts about 25 mins. The following fighters are interviewed: Sergei Kharitonov, Pedro Rizzo, Ramapage(playful), Mark Coleman(edgy), Alistair Overeem(laid-back), Fabricio Werdum, Kazauhiro Nakamura(joking), Yosuke Nishijima, Shogun, and Jon Olav Einemo. The majority of fighters need translators.

Fighter walk-ins feature all the fighters on the card. The segment is about 5 mins. The post-fight interview segment lasts about 7 min and features Josh Barnett, Alistair Overeem, Minotauro, and Mark Hunt(not much to say as usual). DVD program runs about 180 mins. Of course, this is the Pride event that features the post-match brawl between Coleman, Baroni, and Vanderlei. Announcers for this event are Mauro Ranallo and Bas Rutten. Stomps, soccor kicks, and knees to the head/face along with true David & Goliath matches. This was Pride at it's entertaining best.",1250985600,,1018,5.832214765100671
8358919,4,B002A4IY52,"This DVD release completes the Pride FC catalog. Yes, I know there is a Pride 32 and 33, but for some odd reason the DVD's have been released in reverse order for the last few shows.

Here are the fights and some thoughts on them.

Fights:
Mark Hunt vs. Yosuke Nishijima: The ""Main Event"". Kind of an odd choice since Nishijima was making his debut, and Hunt was nowhere near anyone's Top 20 list. Pretty good fight though. Huge, powerful kickboxer/MMA fighter vs. much smaller, quicker, talented pure boxer.

Mark Coleman vs. Mauricio Shogun Rua: The U.S. PPV ""Main Event"". Short fight that ends with a freak broken arm injury. Entertaining post fight brawl in the ring afterwords.

Antonio Minotauro Nogueira vs. Kiyoshi Tamura: Dominant performance, great submission display.

Josh Barnett vs. Kazuhiro Nakamura: Surprisingly somewhat competitive fight. Entertaining.

Alistair Overeem vs. Sergei Kharitonov: Brutal destruction.

Tsuyoshi Kohsaka vs. Mario Sperry: A great, but short, slugfest ending in KO.

Fabricio Werdum vs. Jon Olav Einemo: Slow paced. My least enjoyed fight of the event.

Dong Sik Yoon vs. Quinton Rampage Jackson: Another slow fight with only a few nice action sequences.

Pedro Rizzo vs. Roman Zentsov: Very short, very brutal KO.

Overall, this was an entertaining event. If you are a Pride FC fan, you definitely want to see this one.",1246924800,6,1365,5.131221719457014
