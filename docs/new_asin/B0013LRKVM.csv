3116972,5,B0013LRKVM,"As long as we keep buying them ""all broken up"", the longer they will be ""broken up"".  I for one admit I am a Gunsmoke addict, since the 50's when it started.  I watch 3 or 4 times a day on TVLand.  I tried taping them, however, my old brain is about worn out, and so I would miss some here and there.  I wanted to have them in the order in which they were broadcast in the beginning.  That's when I said ""self, why don't I get them from Amazon.""  I wasn't aware that it was not a whole season's worth until I received the first one.  I'm like so many others out there, I'm afraid I don't have that many years left.  I'll be nearly 100 years old.  I hope I do, but WHO KNOWS?  Maybe my children and grands will bring them to me in the old peoples' home as they get released.  My next fear is that by then, I won't even know what Gunsmoke was, and I won't know who these people are who keep bringing these little tiny frisbees to me.  Dimentia is rampant in my family, both sides of my family.  How can those greedy guts be so unkind to us?  I don't see any of my younger folks watching Gunsmoke.  Not my children nor my grandchildren. (My children did watch Gunsmoke when they were young'uns, but they don't remember.  And the only reason they watched was because Mom and Dad were watching it and we didn't have a TV for every room in the house.  They just knew that tonight we don't get to watch The Nelsons, Beaver, Opie and such, because Mom and Dad will be hogging the TV, watching Gunsmoke.  So who's watching?  We old ones who love Gunsmoke.  That's who and they are treating us like DIRTY pool.",1207872000,6,1600,4.116504854368932
3116973,4,B0013LRKVM,"One of the 20 season 2, volume 1, episodes, ""How To Cure A Friend"" (1956), was mistakenly replaced by the season 4 episode, ""How To Kill A Friend"" (1958). Since season 2, volume 2 has 19 episodes, I had hoped the missing show would be included as a 20th bonus episode, completing the season. It was not. Hopefully, CBS will release it in the future.",1206835200,6,349,4.384615384615385
3116974,1,B0013LRKVM,"Well, on one hand, the releases are continuing for the greatest television Western of all time. Gunsmoke is still making it out on DVD, and old fans and new fans are able to enjoy these classic episodes.

But that good news is more than outweighed by the bad news, which is that at this rate, who knows how long it will take for them to release the entire show? And if the excuse is that it would have taken 10 years to release the entire series with two releases a year, it still doesn't explain why they are breaking the seasons in half. At least if took that long to release the whole series, the buyer would have 20 complete sets, instead of the peacemeal releases we're being subjected to endure.

Dodge City and its fans still deserve better, but at this point, I'm not sure what, if anything, the studio can or will do to make up for their greed and avarice.",1203984000,26,865,4.300613496932515
3116975,5,B0013LRKVM,"I am SO excited that Volume 2 is coming out. I wish they would release by FULL season instead of breaking them up. I would like to get ALL 20 years before I retire! Be that as it may Gunsmoke is an excellent show, timeless, well written and well acted. I have introduced it to the younger generation (my 2 sons) and they are hooked! BRING ON MORE GUNSMOKE!!!!!",1203984000,6,360,4.231884057971015
3116976,5,B0013LRKVM,"Very pleased to see more Gunsmoke due for release again. A lot of pessamists were forecasting the end for the sets due to the split seasons. Well, I too greatly dislike the split seasons, but some Gunsmoke is better than no Gunsmoke , I can't wait to get my next set. Long may they continue ( hopefully?). These prints are such beautiful, pristine quality I think they are worth the price. One tip, check out some other sites and you will save yourself a few dollars.",1203897600,6,467,4.441860465116279

Will only buy complete seasons...Fortunately, all seasons of Wild Wild West were each released complete and at non-inflated pricing (just purchased 3rd season West at $25.99/1211 minutes. Gunsmoke season 2 volume 1 at 526 minutes goes for $30.99. Season 1 (complete) Gunsmoke presently $20.99...comparative convoluted absurdity.

3116979,5,B0013LRKVM,"These are great episodes that help fill in the gaps of the Gunsmoke episodes produced in color.  The b/w episodes were predominantly written by John Meston, who was an amazing writer that stretched the viewer's understanding of the west and our imagination.  I'm thrilled CBS finally decided to re-release these episodes.  I can't wait for seasons 5-11, since those have NEVER been released previously.",1203292800,11,402,5.25

This is the second season, when the show was establishing itself as the best TV western.
This is still the half hour, black & white, small screen TV show of the 50s.
These are excellent stories, fast paced and well acted.  Watch the faces, many of them become famous.
Starting with season two, the seasons are released in two parts and this is the reason for a number of the lower star reviews.
There is no decrease in quality.

Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference.

3117288,5,B0013LRKVM,"Gunsmoke is in the 30 minute format for its first six seasons. Basically what this means to a viewer like me is these episodes get right to the point, and as a general rule, stay right to the point. There is a lot less of the ""filler"" scenes. For example, a 1 hour episode might show Matt Dillon mounting his horse; riding across several different locations; stopping to eat a can of beans beside a little fire he has started to keep him warm that night; and finally he enters Hays City or some other destination. In an episode that is in the 30 minute format the scene would probably just start with Matt entering Hays City. Personally, I find myself in the mood for both types of shows at one time or another, but most of the time I prefer the 30 minute episodes.",1405468800,,765,4.2827586206896555

3117291,5,B0013LRKVM,"Had to jump in here.  Gunsmoke was and still is my favorite Western.  Liked a few others,  but the writing and acting on Gunsmoke was so awesome,  that I watch it every time I get a chance.  About  9 years ago,  there was an offer from one of the magazines that mostly sold tapes.  So I got the first 3 Sasons at a very fair price.  Don't hate me but Bob Denver was not a favorite actor of mine,  and I found him to be boring.  Now I can start collecting again,  with Denver taken out.  Just a matter of taste folks,  mine LOL.  Fester amd Buck Owens,  excuse me,  I am not good on names,  will never be replaced.  Doc felt like a Father figure and the beautiful Amanda Blake was my favorite Actress for so many years.  Her looks were superb,  with those eyes sparkling or could be deadly cold.
I cried for weeks when she left the show and cried for months when she passd away.  And then we had James Arnez who was first introduced by John Wayne.  James Arnez will always be Matt Dillion in my mind and Heart.  What a sweet Heart in real life.  Emailed him and got a reply right back.  He lived,  breathed Marshal Dillion.  So many Actors were in this show.  And the subjects were all way ahead of their time.  To me the writers were all geniuses.  Never before or after saw such writing,  except maybe for MASH.  Define Classic,  and you have Gunsmoke!  If only they made TV like that again.  I know many of you are annoyed about my remarks about Bob Denver,  I apologize but I stick to my opinion.  I liked him in other shows,  and my husband looks just like him,  but as far as Gunsmoke was concerned,  he just didn't keep up to the Giants on the show.  By Giants,  I don't mean well known Actors,  but Actors who could pour out their hearts to play a part that you or I will never ever forget.  Anyone who loved Gunsmoke must have this collection,  to watch whenever they feel down or just bored.  It will entertain you with real like Action from the old Days, when people were on their way west and stopped off at Dodge City.  A place where a person could get killed just passing by a store.  But then it had Marshal Dillion,  who put his blood,  muscle,  and Soul into saving the people he loved or didn't even know.  A Man who put Dodge City on the Map and got it a good reputation,  where people traveling,  but staying overnight could rest their weary bodies and feel safe,  just knowing they are in the most capable hands.  A Doctor who would give it his all to help anyone,  rich or poor,  feel better.  A Saloon owner who Sparkled just standing behind the bar and treated everyone how they deserved to be treated,  And a shaggy whisker wearer,  who had old town skills and also would help anyone who needed help.  He couldn't read or write,  but had more common sense than any College Graduate.  And a gun maker and fixer who fixed bodies part time,  with a baby face and a Gentleman through and through.  They weren't just Actors who played a part,  but Professional people who bought the old days of Dodge City to life again for us to visit,  to admire,  to cry or to laugh.  This was Television at it's finest.  Thank -You for putting up with me.",1402358400,,3161,4.21079258010118

3117410,5,B0013LRKVM,"First let me say that the shipping containers  (padded envelopes) were very inferior. One of the DVD cases was smashed to smithereens and the DVD's inside damaged. I also have to say however that the exchange for the damaged items went smoothly and quickly. I had a new DVD inside of a week before I even sent back the damaged one. Amazon (or whoever sends these out) should ship them in boxes instead of envelopes!

I also have a complaint about the prices. I bought all six DVD's of season one for twenty something dollars. The second season however came in two volumes. One and two at a cost of twenty something dollars each. So while you pay twenty something for all of season one I paid fifty something dollars for season two. What kind of rip off is THAT? What makes season two worth so much more than season one?

Now that I've gotten my complaints out of the way I'll tell you that the DVD's were of the best quality and I immensely enjoyed season one and two. I used to watch Gunsmoke with my dad back in the 50's and 60's when he was still alive. These DVD's brought back some good memories that I had long forgotten.

Wonder why someone mainly an inspector diden't play all the disks once before shipping them to a customer. They would have probably seen the 3rd disk diden't work. I will admit Amazon was great about the return process and said I could do it either way of two way. Refund or a new DVD.

3117413,5,B0013LRKVM,"Bravo! Don't fault the distributor or the studio for the marketing plan. Keep the DVD's coming! I just hope that the actors or their estates are getting some of the financial benefits. Just seeing these episodes makes me appreciate the great actors of the series: James Arness, Amanda Blake, Dennis Weaver, John Dehner, and Milburn Stone. No wonder Gunsmoke was such a popular series and is still able to generate interest and gain new fans.  My 14 year old nephew can hardly wait to borrow my next DVD. Great storylines, plots, and acting.  I will probably stop purchasing when Doc takes his break due to health reasons of Milburn Stone.  What season was that?",1268870400,,661,4.780701754385965

I really liked seeing these old shows and was amazed at what the actors looked like in the old days.  The half hour shows presented a story, played it out and then the closing theme came in.  No need for extra filler like in the hour long shows.  I would definately recommend this for fans of tv westerns.",1265673600,,403,4.194805194805195

3117439,5,B0013LRKVM,"Gunsmoke is the ultimate Western. Every episode is a classic most of which were written by John Meston.

However, I would strongly encourage everyone to write to Paramount Home Entertainment and complain as to these silly half season releases.
This is the letter I just sent to them:

I am sure that a visit to Amazon.com would convince you that your company's marketing of TV by the half season is greatly unpopular.
As a fan of CBS's Gunsmoke, I lament in the fact that it might take your company 20 to 30 years to release this fine series in increments of half years.

There is a complete logic disconnect when CBS series such as Hawaii 50 are still being released in whole years.
I bought the first complete season of Gunsmoke and I bought your Gunsmoke Season 2 vol. 1 and Gunsmoke Season 2, vol. 2 (and I am buying The Untouchables and Perry Mason in this same silly 1/2 season format). I beg you to reconsider this misguided marketing scheme. It has garnered your company scathing comments at Amazon.com. Don't be petty, please return to selling these programs by the whole season. Also please take into consideration that a 20 year series should be released at some sort of reasonable pace. At 4 seasons per year it would still take CBS/Paramount 5 years to release the series. Sometimes it just makes you wonder who your company has that makes their decisions. I am not complaining about the price. I understand you need to make a profit (we're not socialist). I wish CBS/Paramount would consider that if it released series such as Gunsmoke, Perry Mason and The Untouchables in whole seasons at a faster release pace, you would gain:
1) Better PR with your consumers (at the moment your popularity is about par with Chinese cat food manufacturers);
2) Your company would re-establish its brand on these titles - driving black market products into the shadows where they belong - if it is going to take you 30 years to release Gunsmoke - or if you choose to discontinue the release because of lack of interest (caused by your asinine marketing) - then obviously the black marketer will provide the product the public wants and which you will not or refuse to provide.

Its too bad that men such as William Paley are dead. People with vision would see that short term marketing schemes for a company may not always be the goal of a company that expects to be around for the long term.

These are black and white programs from the 1950's & 60's that are just rotting on your shelf. Release them quickly - make a small profit (not much I admit) and build a better image for your company (you know back in the day when CBS was a proud company producing decent programming under a set of established principals, standards and ethics).",1218412800,2,2737,4.611909650924025

It will give you an idea of the kind of adult approach to the western for which it was famous.  It was writing like this that set Gunsmoke apart from all other 50's westerns.

3117468,5,B0013LRKVM,"This show keeps getting better. I now have the complete set for season two and although I am not happy about the pricing, I refuse to protest the business practices of the company that packaged the best drama/adventure series ever created.
This season continues to depict the dark side of human nature and the unpredictability of life in the most honest manner I have ever seen on television. Matt Dillon, Chester Goode, Kitty Russell, and Doc Adams form a tight circle of friendship and battle against those who refuse to obey the laws of Dodge and not adhere to basic laws of decency. The brutality and depravity of human nature is on full display. Many of the episodes do not contain the traditional ""feel good"" endings, which I like because I think it adds to the shows intensity. Most importantly, Marshall Dillon, who is portrayed as a larger then life character, also exhibits weaknesses, doubts, and emotions like all of us. He is not perfect but you know he is doing his best to perform the almost impossible task of trying to maintain law and order on the wild frontier.

Season 2 climbed in the TV ratings to number 8. James Arness was nominated for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor in a Dramatic Series. This series is the best TV show I own and I thoroughly enjoy watching it with my kids. My biggest problem is that my 13 year old son and 11 year old daughter want to watch all the episodes right away. I need to limit the viewing so that we can get at least a months worth of enjoyment out of it.

If you don't like paying the high price for half a season, you can wait until season 3 arrives because like other companies, I think eventually they will package season 2 Vol 1 and Vol 2 into one set and reduce the price to around $[...]. This is what other companies are doing. The risk you run is not having the set available because it is sold out. My final recommendation: Buy it, buy it, buy it.",1212364800,18,1920,4.4209039548022595

I only hope they continue to produce this series until the end. I see so many vintage TV shows start off only to be pulled after one or two seasons. I for one will continue to buy these releases regardless of cost of how they are split up. Lets face it, the studios do not have to release these wonderful shows on DVD. It is just a little extra cash for them. So they can pull the plug anytime they wish.

3117471,4,B0013LRKVM,"I have to say I am happy to see another season volume of Gunsmoke being released on DVD. Yes, I agree with almost everyone: I wish that the studios would release these in complete season sets instead of vol. 1 and vol. 2 but I also think that we should be grateful to have these in complete seasons at all.

Gunsmoke is a great show that keeps you entertained for hours on end. I like to see the old shows where there is still right and wrong.

My only gripe with this set is that it is only a half of a season. If the studio has to release the series like this, why can't they release several sets at a time. At this rate, I probably won't get to see all of the seasons until I am retired! (And I'm not even out of college yet!)

Due to our economy right now, prices on everything are going up. I think the studios are trying to make everything they can off the fans of the old TV shows. It's true I don't like paying the price of 2 seasons for 1 but in the end, if you think about it, it is still a pretty reasonable price to pay for so many hours of wonderful, quality entertainment. I, for one, will buy the season volumes as long as they come out. Thanks Paramount and everyone else involved for at least making the show available to us fans.",1211068800,13,1247,4.040485829959514

I agree with the others that to split the shows up into sets is a rip, but I guess they want to get all the $$$$$ they can.

I watch 3 or 4 times a day on TVLand.  I tried taping them, however, my old brain is about worn out, and so I would miss some here and there.  I wanted to have them in the order in which they were broadcast in the beginning.  That's when I said ""self, why don't I get them from Amazon.""  I wasn't aware that it was not a whole season's worth until I received the first one.  I'm like so many others out there, I'm afraid I don't have that many years left.  I'll be nearly 100 years old.  I hope I do, but WHO KNOWS?  Maybe my children and grands will bring them to me in the old peoples' home as they get released.  My next fear is that by then, I won't even know what Gunsmoke was, and I won't know who these people are who keep bringing these little tiny frisbees to me.  Dimentia is rampant in my family, both sides of my family.  How can those greedy guts be so unkind to us?  I don't see any of my younger folks watching Gunsmoke.  Not my children nor my grandchildren. (My children did watch Gunsmoke when they were young'uns, but they don't remember.  And the only reason they watched was because Mom and Dad were watching it and we didn't have a TV for every room in the house.  They just knew that tonight we don't get to watch The Nelsons, Beaver, Opie and such, because Mom and Dad will be hogging the TV, watching Gunsmoke.  So who's watching?

3351471,1,B0013LRKVM,"Well, on one hand, the releases are continuing for the greatest television Western of all time. Gunsmoke is still making it out on DVD, and old fans and new fans are able to enjoy these classic episodes.

But that good news is more than outweighed by the bad news, which is that at this rate, who knows how long it will take for them to release the entire show? And if the excuse is that it would have taken 10 years to release the entire series with two releases a year, it still doesn't explain why they are breaking the seasons in half. At least if took that long to release the whole series, the buyer would have 20 complete sets, instead of the peacemeal releases we're being subjected to endure.

Dodge City and its fans still deserve better, but at this point, I'm not sure what, if anything, the studio can or will do to make up for their greed and avarice.",1203984000,26,865,4.300613496932515

Well, I too greatly dislike the split seasons, but some Gunsmoke is better than no Gunsmoke , I can't wait to get my next set. Long may they continue ( hopefully?).

This is the second season, when the show was establishing itself as the best TV western.
This is still the half hour, black & white, small screen TV show of the 50s.
These are excellent stories, fast paced and well acted.  Watch the faces, many of them become famous.
Starting with season two, the seasons are released in two parts and this is the reason for a number of the lower star reviews.

3351785,5,B0013LRKVM,"Gunsmoke is in the 30 minute format for its first six seasons. Basically what this means to a viewer like me is these episodes get right to the point, and as a general rule, stay right to the point. There is a lot less of the ""filler"" scenes. For example, a 1 hour episode might show Matt Dillon mounting his horse; riding across several different locations; stopping to eat a can of beans beside a little fire he has started to keep him warm that night; and finally he enters Hays City or some other destination. In an episode that is in the 30 minute format the scene would probably just start with Matt entering Hays City. Personally, I find myself in the mood for both types of shows at one time or another, but most of the time I prefer the 30 minute episodes.",1405468800,,765,4.2827586206896555

3351788,5,B0013LRKVM,"Had to jump in here.  Gunsmoke was and still is my favorite Western.  Liked a few others,  but the writing and acting on Gunsmoke was so awesome,  that I watch it every time I get a chance.  About  9 years ago,  there was an offer from one of the magazines that mostly sold tapes.  So I got the first 3 Sasons at a very fair price.  Don't hate me but Bob Denver was not a favorite actor of mine,  and I found him to be boring.  Now I can start collecting again,  with Denver taken out.  Just a matter of taste folks,  mine LOL.  Fester amd Buck Owens,  excuse me,  I am not good on names,  will never be replaced.  Doc felt like a Father figure and the beautiful Amanda Blake was my favorite Actress for so many years.  Her looks were superb,  with those eyes sparkling or could be deadly cold.
I cried for weeks when she left the show and cried for months when she passd away.  And then we had James Arnez who was first introduced by John Wayne.  James Arnez will always be Matt Dillion in my mind and Heart.  What a sweet Heart in real life.  Emailed him and got a reply right back.  He lived,  breathed Marshal Dillion.  So many Actors were in this show.  And the subjects were all way ahead of their time.  To me the writers were all geniuses.  Never before or after saw such writing,  except maybe for MASH.  Define Classic,  and you have Gunsmoke!  If only they made TV like that again.  I know many of you are annoyed about my remarks about Bob Denver,  I apologize but I stick to my opinion.  I liked him in other shows,  and my husband looks just like him,  but as far as Gunsmoke was concerned,  he just didn't keep up to the Giants on the show.  By Giants,  I don't mean well known Actors,  but Actors who could pour out their hearts to play a part that you or I will never ever forget.  Anyone who loved Gunsmoke must have this collection,  to watch whenever they feel down or just bored.  It will entertain you with real like Action from the old Days, when people were on their way west and stopped off at Dodge City.  A place where a person could get killed just passing by a store.  But then it had Marshal Dillion,  who put his blood,  muscle,  and Soul into saving the people he loved or didn't even know.  A Man who put Dodge City on the Map and got it a good reputation,  where people traveling,  but staying overnight could rest their weary bodies and feel safe,  just knowing they are in the most capable hands.  A Doctor who would give it his all to help anyone,  rich or poor,  feel better.  A Saloon owner who Sparkled just standing behind the bar and treated everyone how they deserved to be treated,  And a shaggy whisker wearer,  who had old town skills and also would help anyone who needed help.  He couldn't read or write,  but had more common sense than any College Graduate.  And a gun maker and fixer who fixed bodies part time,  with a baby face and a Gentleman through and through.  They weren't just Actors who played a part,  but Professional people who bought the old days of Dodge City to life again for us to visit,  to admire,  to cry or to laugh.  This was Television at it's finest.  Thank -You for putting up with me.",1402358400,,3161,4.21079258010118

3351907,5,B0013LRKVM,"First let me say that the shipping containers  (padded envelopes) were very inferior. One of the DVD cases was smashed to smithereens and the DVD's inside damaged. I also have to say however that the exchange for the damaged items went smoothly and quickly. I had a new DVD inside of a week before I even sent back the damaged one. Amazon (or whoever sends these out) should ship them in boxes instead of envelopes!

I also have a complaint about the prices. I bought all six DVD's of season one for twenty something dollars. The second season however came in two volumes. One and two at a cost of twenty something dollars each. So while you pay twenty something for all of season one I paid fifty something dollars for season two. What kind of rip off is THAT? What makes season two worth so much more than season one?

Now that I've gotten my complaints out of the way I'll tell you that the DVD's were of the best quality and I immensely enjoyed season one and two. I used to watch Gunsmoke with my dad back in the 50's and 60's when he was still alive. These DVD's brought back some good memories that I had long forgotten.

Wonder why someone mainly an inspector diden't play all the disks once before shipping them to a customer. They would have probably seen the 3rd disk diden't work. I will admit Amazon was great about the return process and said I could do it either way of two way. Refund or a new DVD. So I don't fault them just whoever recorded the disks for failure to ck. product for ok-ing it to be sold and shipped!,1305244800,,579,4.178571428571429

3351910,5,B0013LRKVM,"Bravo! Don't fault the distributor or the studio for the marketing plan. Keep the DVD's coming! I just hope that the actors or their estates are getting some of the financial benefits. Just seeing these episodes makes me appreciate the great actors of the series: James Arness, Amanda Blake, Dennis Weaver, John Dehner, and Milburn Stone. No wonder Gunsmoke was such a popular series and is still able to generate interest and gain new fans.  My 14 year old nephew can hardly wait to borrow my next DVD. Great storylines, plots, and acting.  I will probably stop purchasing when Doc takes his break due to health reasons of Milburn Stone.  What season was that?",1268870400,,661,4.780701754385965

I really liked seeing these old shows and was amazed at what the actors looked like in the old days.  The half hour shows presented a story, played it out and then the closing theme came in.  No need for extra filler like in the hour long shows.  I would definately recommend this for fans of tv westerns.",1265673600,,403,4.194805194805195

3351936,5,B0013LRKVM,"Gunsmoke is the ultimate Western. Every episode is a classic most of which were written by John Meston.

However, I would strongly encourage everyone to write to Paramount Home Entertainment and complain as to these silly half season releases.
This is the letter I just sent to them:

I am sure that a visit to Amazon.com would convince you that your company's marketing of TV by the half season is greatly unpopular.
As a fan of CBS's Gunsmoke, I lament in the fact that it might take your company 20 to 30 years to release this fine series in increments of half years.

There is a complete logic disconnect when CBS series such as Hawaii 50 are still being released in whole years.
I bought the first complete season of Gunsmoke and I bought your Gunsmoke Season 2 vol. 1 and Gunsmoke Season 2, vol. 2 (and I am buying The Untouchables and Perry Mason in this same silly 1/2 season format). I beg you to reconsider this misguided marketing scheme. It has garnered your company scathing comments at Amazon.com. Don't be petty, please return to selling these programs by the whole season. Also please take into consideration that a 20 year series should be released at some sort of reasonable pace. At 4 seasons per year it would still take CBS/Paramount 5 years to release the series. Sometimes it just makes you wonder who your company has that makes their decisions. I am not complaining about the price. I understand you need to make a profit (we're not socialist). I wish CBS/Paramount would consider that if it released series such as Gunsmoke, Perry Mason and The Untouchables in whole seasons at a faster release pace, you would gain:
1) Better PR with your consumers (at the moment your popularity is about par with Chinese cat food manufacturers);
2) Your company would re-establish its brand on these titles - driving black market products into the shadows where they belong - if it is going to take you 30 years to release Gunsmoke - or if you choose to discontinue the release because of lack of interest (caused by your asinine marketing) - then obviously the black marketer will provide the product the public wants and which you will not or refuse to provide.

Its too bad that men such as William Paley are dead. People with vision would see that short term marketing schemes for a company may not always be the goal of a company that expects to be around for the long term.

These are black and white programs from the 1950's & 60's that are just rotting on your shelf. Release them quickly - make a small profit (not much I admit) and build a better image for your company (you know back in the day when CBS was a proud company producing decent programming under a set of established principals, standards and ethics).",1218412800,2,2737,4.611909650924025

For those of you who are not familiar with the radio series that gave rise to the TV encarnation, give special attention to the episode entitled ""Skid Row"".  It will give you an idea of the kind of adult approach to the western for which it was famous.  It was writing like this that set Gunsmoke apart from all other 50's westerns.

3351965,5,B0013LRKVM,"This show keeps getting better. I now have the complete set for season two and although I am not happy about the pricing, I refuse to protest the business practices of the company that packaged the best drama/adventure series ever created.
This season continues to depict the dark side of human nature and the unpredictability of life in the most honest manner I have ever seen on television. Matt Dillon, Chester Goode, Kitty Russell, and Doc Adams form a tight circle of friendship and battle against those who refuse to obey the laws of Dodge and not adhere to basic laws of decency. The brutality and depravity of human nature is on full display. Many of the episodes do not contain the traditional ""feel good"" endings, which I like because I think it adds to the shows intensity. Most importantly, Marshall Dillon, who is portrayed as a larger then life character, also exhibits weaknesses, doubts, and emotions like all of us. He is not perfect but you know he is doing his best to perform the almost impossible task of trying to maintain law and order on the wild frontier.

Season 2 climbed in the TV ratings to number 8. James Arness was nominated for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor in a Dramatic Series. This series is the best TV show I own and I thoroughly enjoy watching it with my kids. My biggest problem is that my 13 year old son and 11 year old daughter want to watch all the episodes right away. I need to limit the viewing so that we can get at least a months worth of enjoyment out of it.

If you don't like paying the high price for half a season, you can wait until season 3 arrives because like other companies, I think eventually they will package season 2 Vol 1 and Vol 2 into one set and reduce the price to around $[...]. This is what other companies are doing. The risk you run is not having the set available because it is sold out. My final recommendation: Buy it, buy it, buy it.",1212364800,18,1920,4.4209039548022595
3351966,5,B0013LRKVM,"This is classic TV at its best. The transfers are beautiful, the sound is excellent and show, what can I say. This is television the way it was meant to be. I only hope they continue to produce this series until the end. I see so many vintage TV shows start off only to be pulled after one or two seasons. I for one will continue to buy these releases regardless of cost of how they are split up. Lets face it, the studios do not have to release these wonderful shows on DVD. It is just a little extra cash for them. So they can pull the plug anytime they wish.

3351968,4,B0013LRKVM,"I have to say I am happy to see another season volume of Gunsmoke being released on DVD. Yes, I agree with almost everyone: I wish that the studios would release these in complete season sets instead of vol. 1 and vol. 2 but I also think that we should be grateful to have these in complete seasons at all.

Gunsmoke is a great show that keeps you entertained for hours on end. I like to see the old shows where there is still right and wrong.

My only gripe with this set is that it is only a half of a season. If the studio has to release the series like this, why can't they release several sets at a time. At this rate, I probably won't get to see all of the seasons until I am retired! (And I'm not even out of college yet!)

Due to our economy right now, prices on everything are going up. I think the studios are trying to make everything they can off the fans of the old TV shows. It's true I don't like paying the price of 2 seasons for 1 but in the end, if you think about it, it is still a pretty reasonable price to pay for so many hours of wonderful, quality entertainment. I, for one, will buy the season volumes as long as they come out. Thanks Paramount and everyone else involved for at least making the show available to us fans.",1211068800,13,1247,4.040485829959514

To me the best years are the first 8 with Chester. The Vol's out now look great. I agree with the others that to split the shows up into sets is a rip, but I guess they want to get all the $$$$$ they can. They are doing the same with Perry Mason, Rawhide, etc. So someone is buyint all of this.
