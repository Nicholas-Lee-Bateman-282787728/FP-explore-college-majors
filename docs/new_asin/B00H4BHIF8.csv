6131386,5,B00H4BHIF8,"I love this film just like I love the 68 movie. I read the play a few years ago and feel in love with it. Yes this movie takes liberties with the text and rearranging certain things but that's part of adapting the material. The 68 and 96 ones do this as well. It captures the time period and the star crossed lovers but keeps a fast pace throughout which both the classic 68 and 96 films (both classics in their own right) but in today's movie goers would consider slow. It's a beautiful film with a stunning cast, costumes, locations and the music score is just breath taking. A must see and own film!",1389052800,13,602,4.243478260869566
6131387,5,B00H4BHIF8,"The story of Romeo & Juliet was never very significant to me, but whatever the play lacked, this film filled in. With a gorgeous soundtrack, well-acted cast ensemble and beautiful background, this movie is not to be missed. I am now in love with the story of Romeo & Juliet. Such intensity, such passion, such beautiful, innocent romance despite the hate pulling it apart. Just stunning.

This version accomplishes this with flying colors as it grabs you from the get go and strikes a perfect balance of romance, speed, action, character development and goodol fashion bardolatry. It doesnt matter that you know the ending, you will cry. Impecable acting, music, costumes, directing, movie sets. Paul Giamatti at its absolute BEST!",1522108800,,502,5.0602409638554215

6131391,1,B00H4BHIF8,"Note: I saw the film via XFinity On Demand.

This free adaptation of William Shakespeare's immortal tragedie ranks up there with the 1996 drag and drug-fueled version starring pretty boy dicaprio as the worst cinematic versions of the play evee made. Everything is wrong with this film. You would think that the creator of Downton Abbey would have the utmost respect for a fellow Englishman's work, but he does not. While the mediaeval setting of the.play is retained, 99% of the dialogue is thrown out, resulting in a thoroughly unwatchable film. Not even seasoned veterans like Natasha McElhone, Damian Lewis, and Paul Giamatti can save this garbage.

Not even worth a rental. See it for free if you can.

Stick with the 1936 and 1968 versions. They are the finest cinematic versions of the play. If you want to go a bit modern, I recommend West Side Story. I DO NOT recommend the 1996 version at all. Avoid it and this version like the Black Death.",1518566400,,951,4.716867469879518

6131393,2,B00H4BHIF8,The only reason for watching this movie is Douglas Booth.  You have to admit he is simply adorable from any camera angle.  Juliet looks like a cow in a dress and mumbles through every line of the movie with no emotion what so ever.  Horrible actress... what were they thinking when they cast that girl... she isn't even pretty.  I think this is probably the worst Romeo & Juliet I have ever seen... well except for Douglas Booth.  But the poor boy had nothing to play from with that horrible Juliet... I don't think anyone could make a successful movie with her.  Ugh.  Stick to the original with Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting... now that's acting and beauty combine in a spectacular combination!,1514419200,,700,4.642276422764228

It was my choice NOT to include this in our curriculum, but sadly, my co-teachers didn't agree.  It was painful to watch Carlei literally butcher this script and storyline.  While I'm not a fan of reinventing the prose and text, I could have endured it if the director and screenwriter didn't blatantly decimate so many important plot points.  I think many other commenters shared my sentiment and point out so many of them.  There are nuances and careful details laid out by the original author of this play for a reason.  Why take them out or rearrange them?  Characters were manipulated and altered greatly, and I just don't understand why.  Sure, this thing is pretty, the actors are gorgeous and the setting is divine.  I just don't get why millennial driven Hollywood had to make a classic like this and dumb it down and butcher it for a younger generation.  Skip this one and watch the Zeffirelli or if you want something edgy, the Baz Luhrman version is pretty darned spectacular.",1494115200,2,1103,4.783068783068783

As we first started reading, the students were struggling a bit to understand the play, so we started watching scenes after we had: read, rewrote the script and created our own scene. I'd have them watch the 1968 version and then this one.  For a couple of scenes we compared 1996, 1968 and this one.  They finally asked me if we could just watch this version.  Then, when we were done, they asked if we could watch it again all the way through. These were not honors classes, just average 9th grade high school kids.  I am forever grateful to this movie for getting me through the spring!

Still I would choose this one over the recent Orlando Bloom version, or the one Branagh directed with Lily James.  Beware the annoying modernizations of Shakespeare's language, by Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes.  Zeffirelli cut nearly 2/3 of Shakespeare's text but he did not rewrite to modernize the language for dumb Americans.

6131430,4,B00H4BHIF8,"It is always interesting to see what each new production of this timeless classic will do to make it unique. Some recent examples over the past couple of decades have been highly regrettable if not downright offensive, but this performance here is respectable and entertaining, if not quite stellar.

The unique master stroke of this production is probably the language. The screenwriters have rewritten some of the more difficult passages of Shakespeare's language into contemporary usage to make the action easier to follow. At the same time, the beauty and power of the original language has been retained. This requires no small degree of scholarship, which the typical viewer may or may not appreciate. But to a Shakespeare fan like me, it demonstrates a real command of the Bard's cadences and imagery.

Other highlights:  Some of the acting is outstanding. Paul Giamatti turns in a powerful, nuanced performance as Friar Lawrence. He is a master of the small, telling gesture. Damian Lewis is equally commanding as Lord Capulet, by turns passionate and childlike, enraged and capricious. The costumes, sets and music are beautifully rendered. It's a gorgeous film to watch. In addition, there are small tweaks to the plot twists that make the storyline more accessible to modern viewers.

Some weaknesses:  The delivery by the two leads of some of the most memorable lines from this play is disappointingly lackluster and dry. This is especially true of Douglas Booth, who is stunningly beautiful to look at but lacks the vocal quality and the dramatic artistry to bring his Romeo to life. There is little chemistry between Romeo and Hailee Steinfeld's Juliet until we are more than halfway through the film, at which point her performance does improve. And their wedding night scene is one of the most beautiful, tasteful and tender love scenes I have ever seen on screen. But for a story whose drama depends entirely on the combustible passion between its two main characters, their performance is unsatisfyingly limp.

That said, I have watched this film twice now and enjoyed it both times as an interesting take on one of my all-time favorites. For me, nothing will ever match the sheer emotional intensity and power of the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli production of Romeo & Juliet. But this one is interesting enough to be worth adding to my collection.",1466812800,3,2360,5.038461538461538
6131431,5,B00H4BHIF8,"Beautiful production of Shakespeare's finest!  The acting is superb, especially Douglas Booth and Paul Giamatti.  Hailee Steinfeld makes a very sweet and innocent Juliet.  The costumes and set are perfect, as to be expected from Julian Fellowes.  My husband and I enjoyed watching this together on our anniversary, and we both were so mesmerized by the acting, the setting, the costumes, etc., that we both said we could have easily watched it again immediately.  This movie will remain in our collection always as one of our all-time favorites.",1466467200,,545,5.1477272727272725
6131432,4,B00H4BHIF8,"I love that it includes some important scenes that the Zefferelli film left out.

6131435,2,B00H4BHIF8,"So, every twenty years or so Hollywood churns out a new blockbuster version of this play when, honestly, they should have stopped in 1968. I'm trying not to be one of those ""OG is the best"" kind of people, but truly. I really did enjoy Baz Lurman's version, but I can't show it to students with an R rating. So, we will went current teen heartthrobs, Hailee Steinfeld and Douglas Booth because my 7th graders said he was the ""hottest"" Romeo. The film was super boring. The soundtrack seemed to be the main character, Mercutio was a yawner, the Prince looked like a member of the mafia, Capulet was not likeable at all, which he should be for at least brief points in the plot, I could go on. I really enjoyed Paul Giamatti's performance, even though it was so much better than those around him that it felt out of place. Basically, yuck. If you're showing an R&J to your students, show the 1968 version. It's Shakespeare, so they consider it ""old"" anyway, and you can tell them that Leonard Whiting is Zac Efron. It will fool most of them.",1464048000,3,1039,4.445026178010472

6131438,4,B00H4BHIF8,"This movie is beautiful and it flows like poetry. A movie has to do two things for me to like it, it has to make me care and it has to entertain me, and this movie succeeded on both those fronts. I have watched the 1996 version (which was just terrible), so when I watched this movie it felt like a breath of fresh air. I will say that this is the best version of this story, so far. I like that it is made more entertaining, while staying true to the original story (though I wish that the dialogue had been a bit more consistent, but overall it was fine). This movie is a visual and emotional feast, and I enjoyed it. This made me wish that this story would have a happy ending, it would be refreshing to see a sort of ""Disney"" ending to the story for once (anyways I'm going off on a tangent here).

Now back on topic, the chemistry between the two leads is lovely. I liked that they showed more interactions between Romeo and Juliet in this one. I also like that they showed an imagined happy ending between them, giving the viewer a taste of what could have been had the tragedy not occurred. Overall this movie felt like poetry, it was beautiful. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because this story itself was never a favorite of mine, but this movie is now one of my favorites.",1463011200,,1293,4.192771084337349

6131442,1,B00H4BHIF8,"As a Shakespeare professor, I was interested in seeing this production, because I'd heard that it was beautifully filmed (in Verona, no less) and produced. Sadly, I had to turn it off after ten minutes (and even that was through gritted teeth) because I found it literally unwatchable.  Although the film advertises itself as being a faithful depiction of Shakespeare's play and language, it actually dumbs down the language and re-writes or even invents whole passages.  I am by no means a prissy ""purist"" when it comes to productions of Shakespeare's plays; I love the Baz Luhrmann version of R&J (though my heart will always belong to the Zeffirelli), and I love many contemporary  interpretations of other plays as well.  But I can't stand it when the plays are ""modernized"" to make them more ""accessible"" to audiences.  In the hands of a thoughtful director and strong actors, Shakespeare is accessible in the original, and a lot more enjoyable than some dumbed down production.  (Substituting ""yes"" for ""aye"" so that viewers don't get confused?  Seriously?)  Stick with the Luhrmann or the Zeffirelli versions for now, and do your best to support local theater companies in your community that are working hard to present live theatre Shakespeare.",1462320000,19,1253,5.078048780487805

6131444,4,B00H4BHIF8,"I purchased this version because I am a big Douglas Booth fan.  He is beautiful to watch and in my opinion a good actor.

I wasn't familiar with Hailee Steinfeld and my first thought when watching them together is how much younger she looks compared to him.  I don't think their chemistry is bad but it is not overwhelming either.

One actress who really did impress me is Natascha McElhone as Lady Capulet .

I did not buy it for accuracy to the actual Shakespeare quotes.  I am not a Shakespeare scholar but, as others mention, the text is hardly accurate.

Only purchase it if you like eye candy for not only the actors but the sets and costumes.

Everything is rich in color and texture.  The Swarovski Entertainment is one of the producers and you can see their presence is duly noted.  Many of the costumes and especially the masks at the ball are encrusted with Swarovski brand crystals.

In the special features, called ""Creating the Look"", it mentions how the seamstresses stitched in the crystals for so many costumes, how they are ""super sparkly and pretty"", and in case anyone missed the point, the comment ""everything we wanted to sparkle"" says it all.

In other words, it is a long Swarovski commercial.

Mercutio says something about the road to hell being paved with good intentions...eek! Many lines are cut out or put into layman's terms. The movie starts with a joust. Friar John is not quarantined on account of a plague. Balthasar isn't the one to go to Romeo in Mantua. Etc. These were just some of the differences that came to me a week after seeing the movie.

Though I wouldn't recommend this for using in class to show an accurate rendition of the play, I would recommend it for entertainment value (if you can handle a few artistic liberties). Personally, I liked it more than the Leonardo DiCaprio version.",1459468800,3,1158,4.594202898550725

6131473,3,B00H4BHIF8,"Although I think the '68 version is better in many ways, I will be showing part of this movie in my high school English classes. As a teacher, I am grateful this production contains no nudity. They were able to film the ""honeymoon"" scene with Juliet in a nightgown and without Romeo mooning the audience -- much better for a classroom setting! There are also scenes and details that are not in Franco Zeffirelli's  '68 movie, such as Romeo buying the poison, Romeo fighting Paris at the door of the tomb and the fact that Lady Montague has died of a broken heart while her son was exiled. I think this screenplay's death scene is especially poignant because Romeo is still alive -- barely -- when Juliet awakes. However, young Hailee Steinfeld lacks Olivia Hussey's acting chops; the same can be said of most of the 2013 version's supporting actors when compared to the outstanding performances of Michael York,  John McEnery, Pat Heywood, Milo O'Shea and Bruce Robinson, to name but a few of the 1968 cast. Also, so many of the guys in this movie resemble each other, it may be hard for students to figure out which one is which. A side note: It is ironic how much alike the two Romeos (Leonard Whiting; Douglas Booth) in this movie and  Zeffirelli's resemble each other; in fact, I had several students ask if Romeo was played by the same actor in both films!",1442188800,2,1361,4.569672131147541

Acting from Danes was disastrous (Leonardo was better than his costar). I prefer Douglas and Hailee's version. Much more appropriate costume designs and dialogue. This movie makes me wish I lived back then if it weren't for the drawbacks of having no toilets, shaving equipment for armpits, legs, and crotches and eyebrow waxing and no dental access to make teeth straight.

I very much enjoyed this adaptation of the classic play. The parts that were excluded were done so in a way that does not remove from the story, but I was a little disappointed not to see them there.

I'm happy to say that only the beginning is a little slow but it picks up with lots of sword fights, horse riding, a secret marriage and of course the theme of forbidden love.

I loved the balcony scenes, gorgeous scenery and costumes. The masks were really interesting. I felt that Hailee Steinfeld and Douglas Booth had amazing chemistry and were the most beautiful Romeo and Juliet I've ever seen. They both possessed a sweet innocence and hopeful romantic nature.

I was very happy that the romantic scenes were not inappropriate. That was a pleasant surprise.

Shakespeare can be difficult to understand and I don't have the original play memorized so I had no problems with how the script was written. I did turn on the subtitles at one point to make out what everyone was saying. That helped.

I really liked this newer adaptation and I think if you go into watching this with an heart that is not jaded, you will like it too.

6131481,5,B00H4BHIF8,"While some of the dedicated movie-review sites gave this rendition of Shakespeare's classic tale of star-crossed lovers rather low marks, I found it delightful. Judicious trimming of some of the longer speeches improved the pacing of the Bard's immortal story (Mercutio's ""Queen Mab"" monologue is a good example), and there are some fine performances. Paul Giamatti as Brother Laurence and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Benvolio stood out in my mind (though Smit-McPhee looks more like he should be Benvolio's younger brother than a sword-wielding kinsman of the house of Montague); while on the other hand, Stellan Skarsgrd was seriously miscast as the Prince of Verona. Damian Lewis' portrayal of Lord Capulet was something of a mixed bag -- too jovial in some scenes, too overbearing and malevolent in others.

Hailee Steinfeld, who is one of my favorite young actresses, does a fine job as Juliet, despite some passages in which she seems to rush and mumble her lines, and only suffers by comparison to her co-star, Douglas Booth, in that he is somewhat prettier than Miss Steinfeld (and rather too pretty for his own good, even.) The costumes and settings -- the movie was filmed on location in Padua and Verona -- are glorious, and the emotions of the characters genuinely portrayed. There is a comment on the IMDB review site that the film features ""very little of Shakespeare's original text"", which is not true. I have watched this movie with the text of the play in front of me, and while some passages are shortened (as I mentioned earlier), and others slightly reworded (though there are many slight variations to be found in the published versions of the text), for the most part I found it to be true to the text you will find in published versions of the play.",1435017600,4,1765,4.863787375415282

I ignored the critics, for after all the critics initially put down Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet, back in the 60's, which was a masterpiece in film. This production could have been great. It was filmed in Verona. The photography was wonderful with beautiful scenery. It had  young beautiful actors in the leads who should have been up to these rolls and  seasoned supporting actors who were also up to the task. The costumes were sumptuous.  The screen play writer  wrote Downton Abbey, what more could you ask for?
  Where was Shakespeare?  I blame the Director and the writer. The timing was terrible, it seemed to be  a race to see who could say their lines the fastest with as little emotion and passion as possible. Most of the music was non descriptive and unmemorable. This film, as someone stated, was truly Shakespeare for Dummies. Romeo and Juliet is probably  the most well known  and most viewed of all of  Shakespeare's plays  Almost everyone can get it. Romeo and Juliet is why the uneducated masses know who Shakespeare is and is the only Shakespeare play many will ever  experience. This production could have been made for a comic book version.

I am sad to say that it is pretty awful. There are few lines from Shakespeare. Most of the dialogue was written by Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey fame. This was not a good idea. For instance, in the play the Friar abandons Juliet in the tomb at the end with the line, ""I dare no longer stay!"" This is a pretty dramatic moment as the cowardly priest abandons this little girl to suicide. In this film version, he says, ""I'll go keep the guards busy while you say goodbye to your dead husband."" (Of course this is a paraphrase.) He then returns after she has killed herself with Romeo's comically long dagger. As he comes up to her he says, ""Oh oh."" This is not a paraphrase. It is actually what the poor actor has to say. Need I write any more. Do not buy this version of the immortal story. If Julian Fellowes had written it originally, Shakespeare would not have rewritten it.",1421884800,5,1037,4.323076923076923

Ed Westwick as Tybolt, Christian Cooke as Mercutio, and Stellan Skarsgard as the Prince of Verona are standouts. The pacing is fast and smoothe and the movie has an almost contemporary feel about it compared to other presentations of R&J.

6131529,1,B00H4BHIF8,"And I make that claim in the headline having seen bits of Ethan Hawke's Hamlet. There is simply no production of Shakespeare that even comes close to being as emotionally dead, uncreative, and insulting to the intelligence of its viewer as this one. How they managed to make a film in Verona in the period that Shakespeare wrote for so utterly bastardizing of the original play is beyond me.

Let's start with the script. Fellowes is a fantastic writer, I'm sure. I hear fantastic things about Downton Abbey. However, he's not better than Shakespeare. I knew the film was going to be a trainwreck from the very first speech: the prologue. Fellowes replaced about half of the prologue with his own writings about some made up jousting tournament that is supposed to set up the feud or something. There's added scenes like Benvolio's wooing of Rosaline on Romeo's behalf and Friar John's sudden turn as a hero to a family in place of his quarantine. Fellowes also gives the ""No Fear Shakespeare"" treatment to whole chunks of speech. I'm all for making cuts, but there's no cutting being done. It's more like hacking at or butchering the lines.

Then there's the acting. Romeo and Juliet MUST be fantastic if a production of the play is to work. Booth is dull and pretty, in the worst way. Steinfeld is totally lost in the language. It very much feels like they told her how Juliet feels in each scene and that she should just play the general emotion, pretty much the worst thing an actor can do. Benvolio and Mercutio aren't bad, but they can hardly make up for the young leads. The adult cast is also pretty good, but Damien Lewis and Paul Giamatti can't pull all the weight.

Do you want traditional and period-appropriate? Zeffreli's version will much more than suffice. Do you want cutting edge and relatable for youth? Go for Luhrmann. This film tried to mash those two concepts together and the result is an ugly, dumbed down hodgepodge of a film that can hardly even call itself Shakespeare. I really tried to stop watching about halfway through, but it was like a car wreck and one always wants to see if things can possibly get worse.",1419379200,4,2142,4.646437994722955

Juliet is even worse; she seems to barely manage to get her lines out, and is plain in looks and presence in a puzzling way. Hardly someone I can imagine a young man being struck by at first sight, especially while she's half hidden by a mask. To top it all off the chemistry between the two (the single most important element in this case) is non-existent; I mean zero. They don't even seem to really like each other much. WTH.

6131535,3,B00H4BHIF8,"Where do I begin with this movie?

I was very excited about it when I first heard they were making a new Romeo and Juliet movie. And I thought that this movie will be absolutely perfect! However, that is not the case.

Overall, there are a lot of good things about the movie. First off, I love the scenery, the costumes are beautiful, and for the most part the actors were cast perfectly. In particular, I loved Douglas's performance as Romeo. Him crying during the marriage just did it for me. He really expressed his emotions and made the role come to life. The men cast as Mercutio and Tybalt were also one of my favorites.

I also love how certain scenes were added. (Benvolio talking to Rosaline, the nurse warning Romeo about Count Paris, and for once the fight between Romeo and Count Paris was actually shown!) This story is so straightforward otherwise that it does make me wonder about the scenes that could have happened that we did not see happen in the play. That I really appreciated, it adds something extra to the movie and makes it come alive more.

I also absolutely love the soundtrack. I fall in love with a different song all the time. Each song is beautiful in its own way and it fits perfectly with the movie.

On the sour note, I think that the balcony scene was ruined. They have them stand there for a few minutes discussing marriage, and all of the sudden she says ""I forgot why I called you back."" The thing is, Romeo did not even leave. That made no sense to me at all. It felt like they rushed this scene to get it done and overlooked the very details that made this scene so special.

The wedding night scene was not believable either. I know the actress playing Juliet is young, but so were the other actresses before her. I am not saying she should be nude, but I wish they made it look more believable.

And finally, the actress they cast to play the role of Juliet. This is where my comment on most actors being cast perfectly comes in. I think that her performance is absolutely flat. She rambled on and on and at times I could not even catch what she was talking about, even though I read the play and understood all the lines that were written in it. I honestly would not even think about casting her as 'Juliet.' Throughout the movie, I wanted to just shake her and say to her ""Do you even know who you are playing?"" At some point I seriously wanted to switch her with the actress playing Rosaline. With how little she had to work with, every word was filled with emotion and her face changed along with it. She outshone Juliet herself!

And when Hailiee, the actress playing Juliet got scared when she realized that Romeo heard her was completely boring and not believable whatsoever! Her face showed absolutely no change throughout the film either. The only hint of any kind of emotion that she had was during the wedding. And it died right there and then. I felt like she had no clue on what those lines she blankly recited represented. Again, I have no clue how she could have possibly been cast for a role like Juliet.

Overall, this movie had so much potential. If the acting was better and the balcony scene was not messed up, this would have been the best movie of Romeo and Juliet ever made. But I guess I will have to wait longer to finally see a movie that would bring everything together well.",1417737600,3,3344,4.389337641357027

Juliet doesn't speak her lines. I don't know what she speaks actually. I couldn't believe someone could see Juliet in this particular actress - the way she looks, the way she speaks, her whole person. There is not an iota of conviction anywhere.

Even though it is older, I like the costumes and actors better.  I mean Juliet in this version was a very bad actress in my opinion because she had no emotion. Romeo however was ok.

For one, I am personally offended by the blatant disregard for the characters of the Nurse and Mercutio. First, Mercutio's a Montague (???) who we barely see twice, whose genius is entirely muted and cast aside, and whose death is hardly affecting. Unforgivable. The nurse is a sweet, unassuming, mousy old lady. Blasphemous and irresponsible.
The families have a jousting competition to quell their rage? A pointless, outright murder of the true story. (And I believe they only refer to it once- so what was the point of it?) Everyone has already mentioned Juliet's flat and unconcerned delivery of her lines- all true. Romeo's about as empty headed as he needs to be, but nowhere near as authentically emotional as he should be.

It's just too bad that the ball scene and the balcony scene were not as rich as they could have been. Still, has me wondering about Friar Lawrence! What was he thinking?

Fellowes has successfully taken out all the wit, passion, and brilliance of this incredible play and made a lukewarm puddle of melodramatic mush. Even the good actors in the play (Paul Giamatti and Damian Lewis to name some of the precious few) look ridiculous, as if half their energy is taken up with the task of trying to mask the unholy drek that Julian Fellowes has added to dilute the words of William Shakespeare almost beyond recognition. They are trying their best, bless them. The rest of the actors as mentioned in a Telegraph review- treat the Montague/Capulet feud as if its the sequel to a yet more ancient grudge: the one between werewolves and vampires in the Twilight series. Plus while the movie, when viewed with the sound off, is visually stunning (they filmed actually in Verona- points for them there) there is nothing else interesting in the way it is shot, and the director ignored some glaring in-text direction which made him look unnecessarily dumb. The composer does nothing to aid the movie and adds to the obnoxious melodrama feel of the whole thing.

Now I have of late done some adapting of this play myself, a task that was daunting to say the least. I am still not sure that I haven't ruined one of my favorite plays in doing so. But, unlike Mr. Fellowes, I haven't changed anything based on the perceived dumbness of the audience or felt I had the right to adapt Shakespeare based on where I went to college and how much it cost (2nd paragraph- http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/movies/romeo-juliet-adapted-by-julian-fellowes.html)

6131579,3,B00H4BHIF8,"Usually I award three stars to a film I consider to be of watchable quality, but no better.  In this case I would add the caveat that it is nevertheless not actually worth watching when you could instead be seeing Zeffirelli's version, even if for the umpteenth time.  As I regard the latter as the best film ever made, you may suspect I went into Carlei's version with a closed mind, but I think not.  The makers of this film must surely be aware how very often good films are remade disastrously, so I saw it having imagined they would at least have made a valiant effort to compete with such a peerless film. I was wrong.  I had also thought they deserved interest for their sheer nerve in taking it on. In the event, the idiocy of mounting such a feeble challenge undermined the sympathy I might have had for the time and money they wasted.

The screenplay writer is either arrogantly stupid to think he can improve on Shakespeare, most of whose dialogue has been done away with, or so patronising he assumes the audience is too stupid to understand Shakespeare.

The acting of the two leading roles was atrociously wooden.  The Juliet was fatally lacking in both beauty and spark.  The Romeo was good-looking enough, but in the wrong way: too self-consciously so and without the captivating touch of melancholy that made Whiting perfectly-cast in Zeffirelli's film.  This most famous of all love stories has one bedroom scene; if there is one moment in the whole of cinema where some frank homage to the eros that underpins youthful passion is strongly called for, it is here.  Zeffirelli did so with a few exquisitely tasteful nude shots.  Carlei's failure to do likewise is unforgivable.  If he is too much in thrall to the sour attitudes of the day towards celebrating teenage beauty, that alone was reason enough to desist from making a film obviously better suited to a more romantic age.

The redeeming feature was the sumptuously beautiful scenery and cinematography, but even here the old film was as spectacular and its costumes more so.

Only months after seeing it, that is about all I can still remember about this forgettable film.

I'm a believer that Shakespeare should be experienced via live on stage or through cinema, but should be viewed! And this film was a visual feast! One of my favorite seasons was probably the masquerade at the Capulet manor, which is also the courtship between Romeo and Juliet. It was sooo gorgeous! The masks were so intricate!

The music score was also breath taking and fit the film so well, sweet but aching. The actors were perfect. Hailee Steinfeld was the perfect Juliet, young, naive and full of promise.",1402531200,,810,4.697183098591549

On the flip side, the sets and scenery were actually fantastic, and the best I've ever seen in Shakespeare.

We always discuss how Shakespeare's vague stage directions give directors a lot of freedom, allowing his plays to be updated - one reason they are timeless and still relevant today.  But THIS version of the story is completely cringe worthy!!  The acting is flat, the editing is choppy, and key parts of the story are fundamentally changed (Mercutio is NOT a Montague!  Benvolio does not hit on Rosaline - who, by the way, is about to become a nun, or already is a nun, in the play).  Not only that, but extra dialogue - not the Shakespearean lines - is added.  It feels like it's been ""dumbed down"" to the point of being totally insulting.  I showed the first 20 minutes to my students - and they were even like ""WTF???"" If you've read the actual play, I don't see how you could enjoy this movie or take it at all seriously (even within the bounds of the freedoms Shakespeare provided for updating his stories).  Paul G. as Friar Lawrence was good (he's always great in any movie, just about), but the other characters' relationships seem forced and fake.  And the constant ""romance novel"" shots of Romeo are laughable (esp. the opening shot where you first see him...I mean, come on, really???).

Don't get me wrong -- I love modern adaptations of Shakespeare when they are well done, but I'm not even sure what this version was trying to be. It's not a modernized version, nor is it Shakespeare. The dumbing down of the language might have worked had there been any chemistry at all between two the leads (I actually dozed off during the balcony scene). However, as it's more exciting watching paint dry than these two, the loss of Shakespeare's beautiful language leaves an even bigger hole. There are also places in the film that make no sense because a line here or there has been left out, but is still responded to by another character. ??? Given, it was pretty arrogant of Fellowes to attempt to rewrite Shakespeare in the first place, the fact that he falls flat on his face in these areas kind of serves him right, imo.

With the exception of Paul Giamatti as the Friar and Ed Westwick as Tybalt, the entire cast is passionless. Mercutio and the nurse, who are normally so animated (and written as such) are just as lifeless as the two leads here. If you want to do a modern version of R&J, then update it completely and write a modernized script -- don't edit the Bard. Believe me, his text needs no ""help"" from you. This version just ruins the beauty of the language and encourages intellectual laziness. If kids these days don't want to learn to understand the original text, they don't deserve the joy one gains from reading, or watching interpretations of, the Master storyteller.

First of all, he changed the script. Um, it's Shakespeare. You don't do that! Second, it was clear he didn't understand the story to begin with. Like all of the characters' personalities were changed, and visually characters didn't match their description, but he kept in the description anyway.
There are parts that make zero sense because the director didn't understand the script! Like for example, when Romeo goes to see Juliet before the famous balcony scene, he says, ""he jests at scars but has never felt a wound."" Originally, this was supposed to be said to mercutio because he was making fun of Romeo for his love of Rosaline.  But in this film, Romeo just says it, and it makes like zero sense.
On top of that, the two characters are just passionless. They recite their lines while staring at each other. It's boring. And there's this weird music behind the entire film! Like it's never quiet! Just one big song!
Thematically, this movie completely misses the mark. It is pure and utter junk.
The only redeeming quality it has its Romeo is hot. Like really hot. So, put that pure and utter junk in mute!
You know what it's like? It is like as if someone stepped on a butterfly in the post and created this weird other parallel universe where Shakespeare suddenly wrote purely constructed, flat plays.

Those who appreciate Shakespeare's language will be gravely disappointed with the writer's modifications, and students watching this to better understand the play will be disappointed since there are scenes and character changes that aren't true to the play's. Having taught Romeo and Juliet for over 20 years, I was hoping this version would fall somewhere between Zeffirelli's beautiful but dated take and Baz Luhrmann's over-the-top but somewhat entertaining 1990s vision. Alas, gentle reader, it falls no where near either. And that's a shame. Julian Fellowes has let his BBC acclaim clearly go to his head. It's not that he added a line here or there; it's that whole chunks of Shakespearesque dialogue  is peppered throughout the story. I guess he figured two of English drama's most famous scenes--the Capulet feast and the balcony scenes--would benefit from modernization. They don't. Additionally, most of the cast, with the exception of Damian Lewis's Lord Capulet, sleep walk through their roles. Romeo's delivery is downright boring. There's no passion, no ""life."" When he hears of Juliet's death, he reacts as if he just found a distasteful stain on his favorite codpiece. As Juliet, Hailee Steinfeld is too American and untrained to serve the language well. I defy the director to say there weren't any strong British actresses who could have nailed this role without struggling with both accent and syllabication. Even fiery Tybalt and passionate Mercutio come across as little more than walking mannequins. Where's the ribald humor and the celebration of life necessary to provide contrast? And the Capulets and Montagues are jousting at the film's outset for what reason exactly?  Benvolio chats up Rosealine, why? Nothing is improved by adding the scenes, so what was the director thinking? I do believe no story is too sacred to be revised. Revisions, however, need to serve the narrative. Not the case here. I'll continue to show my students scenes from the Zeffirelli and Luhrmann productions, but there's nothing here that would increase their interest in or understanding of the text.

6131626,5,B00H4BHIF8,"The love story of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is so powerful that it still holds sway on every stage devoted to the bard's works, as well as school and general productions and various cinematic interpretations. Whether or not the viewer responds to this version as adapted for the screen by Julian Fellowes is a matter of mental malleability  - to see and feel the tragedy in one of the most distilled and credible versions to date or to push away because it is not a word for word reproduction of the original. Film allows the expansion and condensation of a story and that is what Fellowes has provided - paring down some of the play and reshaping some of the characters to make the love story bloom as spontaneously and rapidly as possible and then shortly after the climax, make the resolution of the love song far more poignant than ever. Carlo Carlei makes Fellowes adaptation work in the splendid way he opens up the story and draws powerful performances form a very well selected group of actors.

The story is so well known that it need not be summarized: Romeo and Juliet secretly wed despite the sworn contempt their families hold for each another. It is not long, however, before a chain of fateful events changes the lives of both families forever. California actress Hailee Steinfeld (`True Grit') may not be the most beautiful Juliet on record but her emerging from child to woman is magnetic. Douglas Booth is strikingly handsome and genuine as a perfect Romeo. Christian Cooke is a striking Mercutio and Ed Westwick is the evil proud Tybalt whose murder of Mercutio and whose death at Romeo's hands sets the tension for the story. Juliet is a Capulet (parents played by Damien Lewis and Natascha McElhone) and Romeo is a Montague (parents played by Thomas Arana and Laura Morante). Stellan Skarsgrd is the decisive Prince of Verona, Kodi Smit-McPhee is Benvolio, but it is the expanded characterizations of the Nurse superbly enacted by Lesley Manville and Friar Laurence brilliantly portrayed with immense sensitivity by Paul Giamatti that makes this version work so extremely well.

The setting is breathtakingly splendid - all set in Italy - and the musical score by Abel Korseniowski and cinematography by David Tattersall polish this gem to a fare-thee-well. For this viewer this is one of the finest interpretations of Romeo & Juliet ever made. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 14",1394841600,2,2411,4.88997555012225

But this version also using Shakespearean English is now my favorite and I have seen them all. The directing is flawless, the costumes are stunning and the makeup and hair...looks as though we were in that period of time. Douglas Booth is awesome as Romeo, I felt his emotions at all time. Hailee Steinfeld as Juliet, just lovely. The entire cast of this movie should take a bow, Paul Giamatti, Ed West, Damian Lewis and Christian Cooke. My second favorite performer after Douglas Booth has to be Kodi-Smit Mcphee as Romeo's cousin, Benvolio. The reason is his stand out performance and delivery and you feel his love for his cousin in his every word and facial expression.",1394668800,3,826,4.703448275862069

They viewed the movie after reading, listening to the CD (which I purchased from Amazon, great CD also) and discussing the play. While it is not like the play itself, it is a great adaptation of the play. I loved the costumes the actors wore for the Capulet ball!  The masks were great. They left out some scenes and added some scenes, but it kept the action and the storyline moving. It would have been nice if they had left a portion of Juliet's soliloquy the night before she takes the sleeping potion.  I would have liked the kids to see her uncertainty about going along with Friar Laurence's plan. I believe they shorten some of the soliloquies.  The sword fights between Tybalt and Mercutio, Romeo and Tybalt were done very well. I had my students take notes, they had write down anything they noticed that was different from the play they read. I was completely overjoyed that at least one student in each class (3 classes) noticed that Lady Montague (who is said dies of grief from Romeo's banishment) was still living at the end of the movie. Another teacher borrowed it to show to her class, she loved it also and she always shows the 1968 version! Like I said, it not word for word like the play, but it kept three classes of 14-15 year olds interested in a story more than 450 years old. Some were so interest, one girl said out loud (when Romeo is about to drink the poison) ""Oh, please don't drink it!""

I like different versions of art, especially Shakespeare. But if you are going to be different you have to commit to it. Fellows attempt to make the language more accessible has simply swapped out some of the more arcane words and scenes for things closer to modern. The effect is to make it barely more understandable to most viewers and take away the beauty of the prose that people who already liked the story are used to.

His work would have been far more effective with the same cast and costuming and a No Fear Shakespeare translation for the script. If he had committed to full modern dialogue I think the movie would not have disappointed so many people.",1394409600,2,796,4.6453900709219855

Changing the plot for schmaltz is lame and inexcusable--shame on all responsible for this. (or we can have Macbeth say he's sorry and Lear advise it was all a misunderstanding at the end of those tales)

The sets and staging are great, the players suitably attractive but variable.  Too often it sounds like they're reading the script instead of acting it (excepting Mercutio & Friar Lawrence).  The two principals are either under-directed or apathetic.  The film score could have been bolder also.  All in all a disappointment.  Let's hope Julian Fellowes leaves Shakespeare alone after this.

Romeo is prettier than Juliet and Mercutio & the nurse left all their humorous character behind which was a shame. By the way Mercutio is not a Montague as suggested by the film and there were just dozens of inaccuracies in the script that didn't add or make any sense at all.

The Zeferreli version offers a mostly true-to-script period piece, the Luhraman version offers a truer-to-script than Zeferreli rendition in an updated time-period, and this one I was excited to see offers a period piece with a more modernized script. I have no problem with the script changes, although I think the change in Mercutio's personality and role in this film was unnecessary, but my problem lies in the execution by the actors. Romeo and Juliet were TERRIBLE. Hailee Steinfeld, although wonderful in other films, is awful in this one. Shakespeare is hard, but was NO ONE there to interpret lines for her and offer suggestions on inflection? Every line is either monotone and emotionless or delivered too rapidly with stress placed on the final word in the line. Romeo is okay, but I think only because in comparison to Juliet he has to be better. I feel so disappointed that none of the more experienced actors who were delightful or the director was willing to push these kids to deliver the lines in any meaningful way.

6131647,2,B00H4BHIF8,"If you love the play (as I do), my guess is that you'll not be disposed to like this version.  The screenwriter, Julian Fellowes, takes some pretty significant liberties with Shakespeare's original text, which consistently left me wincing when I anticipated a line, only to hear a paraphrased version.  I hate to sound all snooty and say you shouldn't mess with Shakespeare (I'm sure it's not perfect) but I would think a screenwriter would set a pretty high standard for changing what the Bard wrote, and based on the number of changed lines, I get the feeling that Fellowes set the bar pretty low.  It's the language of the play that makes it so wonderful to me.  The general story itself never interested me until I read the play and similarly themed stories (such as West Side Story) have never captured my interest.  I don't buy that the language is too hard for modern audiences: even the most opaque puns and outdated language can be translated to audiences via acting and directing.  And almost everyone has probably read (or was supposed to have read) the play in high school, so it's not as if this is going to be the first exposure to the play for most people.

There was also bizarre changes or additions that didn't make any sense to me.  A tournament to start the film?  What did that add to the story besides having a scene with mounted knights and lances?  Mercutio a Montague rather than the Prince's family?  OK, not sure what that accomplished.  Benvolio and Rosaline at Capulet's ball?  Maybe that would have been more interesting if Romeo hadn't already moved on, but it just seemed strange.  The Tybalt-Juliet scene after the ball?

One thing that puzzled me was that Mercutio never felt like an important character.  His major Queen Mab speech was cut short and it seemed that there was more effort to establish Romeo and Benvolio's friendship than Romeo and Mercutio's.  I feel like the director made this effort to make Benvolio a larger character, which I think made for some powerful scenes at the end of the movie, but when this is at the expense of Mercutio's character, who is one of the few really interesting/dynamic characters in the play, I felt that was a mistake.

One odd criticism that I've seen in a number of reviews is that Douglas Booth was too pretty, or prettier than Juliet, and this was somehow a problem or a distraction.  This is hardly a new dynamic as I would say that both Leonardo DiCaprio and Leonard Whiting were `prettier' than their respective Juliets (who were both lovely!) which I don't think was a problem in either of those films.  My take is this has a lot to do with how R&J movies are marketed at teenage girls as their prime audience and that a `beautiful' Romeo is what you do to sell seats at the theatre.

In the end, I don't think that Haillee Steinfeld was a strong enough actress for Juliet.  This is probably the hardest role in the play, covering a huge emotional range and demonstrating significant changes and maturation in the character over the course of the play.  She seems to be reading lines and not adding any emotion or inflection most of the time.  I just never felt that she was quite there.  Booth was fine as Romeo, not great, but not bad.

And just once, I'd love to see a movie where they can't touch or kiss during the balcony scene (which is what the text of the play makes clear).  Or at least take out the line `What satisfaction canst though have tonight?' which makes no sense if they're in physical contact.

To say some positive things: the setting and cinematography was beautiful, as many have said Lord Capulet was well played as was the Nurse I think.  I thought that Benvolio was well played although the actor was distractingly way younger looking than Romeo, Mercutio, Tybalt etc.  I like that they kept the scene in where Romeo kills Paris as that was not in the Zeffirelli or Lurhmann versions.

Overall, I just don't think this version offered anything new or interesting.  The Luhrmann version did this and thus I think was worthwhile.  I don't see any reason why this would replace the Zeffirelli version as the cannon version of the movie.",1393200000,3,4149,4.616643929058663

6131671,2,B00H4BHIF8,"We know that all Romeo and Juliet movies are not created equal, but the trailer made this one look good, atleast as good as Zeffirelli's movie, which, let's say, it 's among a small number of movies I own.

First of all, it is often impossible to understand long blocks of text, and it did not matter who is the speaker.  Zeffirelli's version is truer to the original 16th century text, so that wasn't the problem.  Zeffirelli's actors were just careful to annunciate every word.

Juliet was often not particularly appealing.  Romeo IS reasonably appealing - except when he is looking at Juliet.

The action seemed choppy in ways it never has before.  We know these were impulsive kids whose actions in the great scheme of things don't make alot of sense, but in most versions they make sense to a teenager's mind, and the actions of these kids came off as making no sense at all.  For starters, in Zeffirelli's version, the ball scene where the two fall in love comes across as making sense, and in this version it does not.

For one thing, Zeffirelli's version has the kids work harder at falling in love and more intrigue is involved.  For another, in Zeffirelli's version it is easy to see what the attraction is, and in this version that is really not possible.  So, in Zeffirelli's version, two kids that you or I could reasonably fall in love with, see each other, play with each other from across the room, covertly meet later and talk, then encouraged by Friar Lawrence, who is suitably NOT portrayed as more intelligent and wise than he is, they impulsively decide to marry - but each time, intimacy not carried out holds promise and attraction for the next scene.  In the current movie, two kids who have never laid eyes on each other, who you or I wouldn't especially like if we saw them, see each other across a crowded room, and within five minutes, they are out in the hall passionately making out.  It strains plausibility!

The horseback riding scenes added a sense of drama in the short run but in the long run mostly inspire one to ask why if Juliet was capable of concealed flights, on horseback and in boats, and of physically guiding Romeo out of her father's property, she did not flee her father's household instead of the elaborate and rather strange subterfuge.  We asked that in high school English class, of course - though it took the teacher to ask it out loud - but in this movie Juliet comes across as a spirited girl with a head - atleast, sometimes.

The set could be said to be better done; unfortunately it is over done.  The ball reminds me of a scene out of a vampire movie.  The ceiling in Juliet's bedroom wasn't the ceiling of any wealthy girl in Renaissance times, unless maybe she were an empress, and usually not then.  It was a bedroom, not the Cistine Chapel.

I think the too-long scene, full of additional lines that were never in Shakespeare's version, where Friar Lawrence confronts the Capulets' grief, is where I finally decided not to even watch the rest of the movie.  Having the novice monk stop in at the hut of a peasant with a sick child over did it as well.  By the time the young men are going to miss him on the way back we've lost interest.",1391990400,,3202,4.503460207612457

This 2013 film stands on it's own and creates it's own beauty, and should be equally appreciated.  Do Not Miss It!!!!!

6131677,5,B00H4BHIF8,"First, to everyone who plans to grouse and moan about deviations from Shakespeare's ""script"":  Get over it.  This tale was being batted around bardic circles long before Sweet William added his artistic poetry to it.  In the same way Led Zeppelin made timeless anthems out of hacked cover tunes, Shakespeare did create a poetic pinnacle in his rendition of the Star-Crossed Lovers.  This film, however, is NOT a senseless rehashing nor a Bowdlerization (fig-leafed, Disney-fied,,, choose your own castigating adjective here) but a smart reminder of an ages-old lesson.  The main characters are young, innocent and enviably beautiful.  The supporting cast weaves the web of missed connections and prejudices that catches them believably.  (Extra marks for Ed Westwick's portrayal of the passionate, angry Tybalt and the clever casting choice of a very young Benvolio, making him the reflective eyes of the heartbroken audience.)  Also, excellent photography, lighting, costuming and fight choreography.

I was recently reminded of the REASON this story is retold - and needs retelling - as often and in as many ways as possible.  There are still stereotypes and cultural tensions that divide us as people so the message binds us universally.  The real point is not of the death of lovers, but the true ending:  the realization of futility.  It is naughts-and-crosses.  To hate is to court death.  Show it at every meeting of the UN, before every session of Congress... and around-the-clock against the backdrop of the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.

I'm someone who watched the black/white version and haven't been able to watch any remakes because they just don't seem good enough. Like the only remake I've seen that could probably match it is the one were they used guns. I forget which version it is. But that one and the black/white version are good enough for me.

Not only does young and beautiful Hailee Steinfeld give a excellent and compelling performance, she has the English accent spot on! (She is definitely an Oscar level actress and Hailee makes one of the most gorgeous Juliets at only 15 yrs. old at the time of filming this movie!) Both Hailee and Booth have incredible chemistry. There are no shocking nude scenes, just brilliant acting, and a great cast and production. I would not be surprise that this movie will be considered a classic in the future. It was in limited release and most folks in a age of special effects ,shocking images, and non-stop in your face comedy or action movies,are not used to the quiet pace of this film. But given the chance, regardless of the critics and folks who just want to bash the cast, this movie shines with a clear and straight forward Romeo and Juliet movie with no gimmicks.  There is a nice small surprise in the film,(at least to me,) a scene every Romeo and Juliet fan always wanted to see IMO. And this movie I think finally does it without changing the tradition of this play. You will have to find out for yourself and watch the movie. ;)",1391212800,15,1211,4.576036866359447
6131683,4,B00H4BHIF8,"I am a firm believer that there are many ways to re-tell a story, and whether a story or book may have been adapted before, others come up with their own version that is fresh and different and worth seeing. So while I have seen (and love) the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting and enjoyed the modern-day revisionist version by Baz Luhrmann, I found myself also enjoying this new version very much.

It is worth noting that the screenplay was penned by British screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Oscar-nominated ""Gosford Park,"" ""The Young Victoria"" and that lovely gem of a mini-series ""Downton Abbey"").

The cast is comprised of both respected veterans (Damian Lewis, Paul Giamatti, Stellan Skarsgard, Lesley Manville) and young, up-and-coming actors (Douglas Booth, Hailee Steinfeld, Christian Cooke, Kodi Smit-McPhee).

The sets are sumptuous (all of the filming was done in Italy and the Italian landscape and architecture are themselves stars in the film) along with the beautiful costumes.

It should be noted that this film is not a copy of the 1968 version. It stands on its own - some scenes are presented differently than the 1968 version; other scenes are brought in that are not in previous versions and vice versa. In addition, if you are a Shakespeare scholar, then please note that the filmmakers had stated from the beginning that they wanted to make a Romeo & Juliet in the classic setting that would appeal to modern audiences. So if you are expecting a word-for-word presentation of Shakespeare's work, then you will be disappointed. Those looking for a definitive R&J adaptation may be better off renting//buying the 1968 version or going to see the Shakespeare play. In fairness to the filmmakers, this is Carlo Carlei and Julian Fellowes' version of R+J and they have done a lovely job of it, in my opinion.

If I had one little complaint about this version, it would be that Hailee Steinfeld pales in comparison to Olivia Hussey's Juliet. Hailee doesn't quite have the command of the language like she did in ""True Grit"" although credit to her for even trying. Douglas Booth fares much better and is comfortable with the language. He also adds a charm, sensitivity and charisma to Romeo and holds his own against veterans like Paul Giamatti and Lesley Manville.  His scene with Friar Lawrence after the fight with Mercutio and Tybalt is one of my favorites. The other actors do well particularly Damian Lewis, Giamatti and Manville and fans of Ed Westwick will likely be curious to see him in a very different role than Chuck Bass.

While this version may be one of several already done, it is certainly worth seeing. I enjoyed it and plan to see it again and again so will be buying the DVD/blu-ray. If you have not yet seen any of the R&J films and/or want a more faithful version of Shakespeare's work, then do not miss the 1968 version because that is still the best. If you are a fan of Shakespeare and/or R&J and are interested in seeing other versions, then this film and the one with Leonardo diCaprio/Claire Danes will offer contrasting perspectives and are both worth watching.",1390780800,68,3123,4.848030018761726
6131684,3,B00H4BHIF8,"""Never was a story of more woe then this of Juliet and her Romeo."" While at a party Romeo (Booth) sees Juliet (Steinfeld) and it is love at first sight. The only problem is that they each belong to a different side of families that are at odds with each other. Knowing that their love is forbidden they marry in secrecy. A mishap with Romeo begins a chain of events that change the lives of everyone involved. There really isn't that much I can say about this movie. It is Romeo and Juliet. Everyone knows the story and the outcome. While the story is timeless and a classic as far as movies go you can only make it so many times before it becomes overdone. I will just answer the questions that I'm sure everyone has when they hear about it. Yes, it is a period movie. Yes, it is in ""Shakespeare talk"". I have never been a Shakespeare fan and in terms of direct movies based off his work I have really only liked the Romeo & Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes. On the other hand this wasn't terrible but it is still Romeo and Juliet. Either you like the story or you don't.

Who would have the audacity to replace the genius of Shakespeare with their own croaking pros? They don't have the original dialog or stick to the story line. Instead they have a bunch of people prancing around saying things that kind of sound Shakespearean. What they did to Romeo and Juliet is a crime, an absolute crime.

Do yourself a favor and make the extra effort to work your way through the Shakespearean version. Understanding the dialog may take a bit more effort, but it is well worth it. Shakespeare was a man of great genius, imagination, and eloquence. He is second only to Dante Alighiere. Dont waste you time on this drivel. It is unwatchable.",1390348800,16,837,4.58

But this version really annoyed me - - it was so unwatchable that I cannot believe that I made it to the end.

Most of Shakespeare's lines were changed and even moved to the wrong scenes.
There are many lines and scenes that Shakespeare never wrote.
Many of the lines were modernized - - using the word YOU constantly.

In this version, Rosaline speaks - - in the real play, Rosaline never gets any lines and is never brought out to play.
There are lines between Juliet's parents that never happened.
Romeo and Juliet actually go horseback riding together.
There is too much fighting.

My favorite scenes in the play are the balcony scene and the death scene.
Both of these scenes were ruined in this movie.
The balcony scene was completely rewritten, cutting out the best lines.
And the death scene was horrible - - Romeo and Juliet actually open their eyes and look at each other ! ! !",1522454400,,912,4.481927710843373
