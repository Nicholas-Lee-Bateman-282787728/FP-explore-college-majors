6567630,5,B00MBNYKBY,"Anime with an amazing plot.  At first I thought it would be a typical anime series but, the creators of the anime showed a series that really get you interested with a little action, fun and sadness all in a good balance.  I can only say that this is a wonderful series.  It is so good that it has been on back order throughout world when it came out in other languages.  The distributers ran out of copies the first week of the release and they were back to back trying to meet the demand for this series",1415232000,,505,4.122448979591836
6567631,5,B00MBNYKBY,"At first glance Gargantia looks like a generic mecha anime that isn't very different from all the others, but it quickly proves that this isn't the case.  Rather than being action based, Gargantia is very plot and character driven, which makes the series very unique and refreshing from other mecha animes.  The story starts off looking like the Gargantia fleet is in constant danger of pirate attacks, but there's a twist to this that completely swifts the story in another direction.  I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this series, and I highly reccommend it.

6567632,4,B00MBNYKBY,"Ledo is a soldier. All his life he has only known war, war against aliens that threaten the existence of the human race. During an intense battle, Ledo is warped though space and ends up in a location that neither he nor his computer recognize. When he awakens from hibernation, he finds himself on a planet whose surface is covered in water and humans live on giant ships.

This anime had a fantastic start. The first three episodes were awesome. Sadly, it went from awesome to good and stayed there until the end. After which I promptly went back and watched the first three episodes again.

The beginning stands out as a story of a boy living in a totally alien environment and learning to adapt. He has to learn new language, learn that killing is not ok, and what free time is.
Then he masters the language and a bunch of girls with super rosy cheeks and knees start taking up screen time. If you like cute girls this might be seen as a bonus. I am getting tired of cute girls so this just annoyed me. Compounded with some incredibly predicable plot developments and stereotypical situations, the show dropped from 5 to 4 stars in my book.

Of the characters, the one that stood out most was Chamber, Ledos mecha. I think this is the first time I have seen show with a mecha with an AI and it was very well done. Also, Chamber has a sort of sense of humor. He is cool and funny. Ledo starts out interesting, but then falls back into typical shonen hero behavior. Amy is cute and spunky and entirely one dimensional.

But despite all my complaints, I really did like this show. My biggest problem was really disappointment that something I thought would be great was simply good.

The ending wraps up nicely. A second season was announced, but it somehow ended up as a 1 hour OVA instead of an actual season. I haven't seen it, but apparently it takes place 6 months after the events from this season.",1408406400,,1905,4.4314285714285715
6567633,5,B00MBNYKBY,"Ensign Ledo, of the Galactic Alliance, is but one of many soldiers bred to fight against a hostile alien force known as the Hideauze, which resembles Earth squids. Piloting his trusty Machine Caliber named ""Chamber"", a mecha with artificial intelligence to assist him in combat, Ledo and Chamber join the other Galactic Alliance members as they attempt to destroy a Hideauze force. Despite their numerical superiority, humanity suffers yet another agonizing loss, and Ledo isn't quite able to hang onto the last human spaceship escaping from the battle, and gets thrown off course as the wormhole closes...

He wakes up 6 months later from a forced hibernation, when some primitive humans using old Earth technology such as jack hammers are unable to break into Chamber's advanced hull. After some mishaps, he learns that he's living on a giant fleet of ships collectively known as the Gargantia, which is sailing over a vast ocean on a planet called Earth, which according to Chamber should be a frozen snowball that humanity abandoned hundreds of years earlier.

End of plot synopsis.

The amazing sci-fi space battle that occurs in the first fifteen minutes or so of episode 1 is actually just the backdrop to this show. It really throws you for a loop, as the show largely focuses on life aboard the Gargantia fleet. At first glance it might seem like ""Waterworld: The Anime"", but it's far more than that.

I really enjoyed the fish out of water experience Ledo goes through, as he's been trained to be a soldier his entire life, and is unfamiliar with concepts such as getting a job. Ledo also tells a sickly, bedridden boy named Bebel that he would have been disposed of in the Galactic Alliance, due to humanity's extremely limited resources in space. But on Earth he gradually learns that despite his disability, Bebel still has other uses, such as teaching and researching more about humanity's past, which other people who are capable of working don't have the time or luxury to do.

As the people of Gargantia attempt to salvage derelicts from humanity's past buried underneath the ocean, digging up ancient weapons that are far more advanced than the guns they use such as laser turrets and railguns. Without giving too much away, Ledo also learns more about the origins of how the war started out between the Hideauze and the Galactic Alliance.

I really enjoyed watching this show on crunchyroll's website, and will definitely be ordering this. It also seems that this set includes the two OVA's, which gives more character development to Ridget, one of the leaders aboard the Gargantia, and to the main villain Ledo faces off against in the last few episodes.",1408060800,8,2674,4.904867256637168

I have had a few dozen people watch this [anime fans and not so much] and not only did they all think it was good, they thought it was amazing! The pacing, the feels, the action, even the downtime episodes are just great!

That, and so much more.

This show blew me away with it's consistently high quality animation, musical composition, writing and pacing. It's a charming story that delves into some complex situations and dark subject matter, but manages to be cheerful and colorful at times as well. In this world of product over art in the Anime industry, I feel this show did something brave and dared to be a work of art first and a product second.",1468281600,,689,4.647540983606557

6567647,4,B00MBNYKBY,"A highly overlooked mecha series that made me change my opinion on the genre. Gargantia centers around an 'alien' that ends up stranded on a foreign planet and ends up having to adapt to there way of life. No big deal. However, despite the overused premise I found the show's plot a refreshing take on the scenario that added more depth than the usual 13 episode anime. If you're a fan of sci-fi or mecha and want a good mix of action and feels, I would highly recommend this series. Gangantia isn't any ground-breaking series that will blow your mind, but it is a fun watch that will leave you entertain and interested with every episode.",1453593600,4,639,4.517241379310345

6567657,5,B00MBNYKBY,"I honestly started watching Gargantia because I was streaming video on my iPad while doing chores around the house.  I wasn't expecting it to be very good, and it had been recommended to me by a few friends as ""a good show that balances human drama and mecha without being overwhelming.""  The first episode starts with your rather standard (though gorgeous) CGI space battle that is a mixture of Macross and Yamato.  Then, something happens, and the main plot starts to take off.

I was worried that large cast of characters introduced in the first few episodes would be overwhelming enough that most characters would seem lazily constructed, but it turned out not to be the case.  Don't get me wrong, there are DEFINITELY one dimensional characters -- the absurdly curvy pirate, the can-do love interest, the unsure executive officer -- but they are tastefully one dimensional, and they also are executed beautifully.  Indeed, of all these examples, the pirate is probably the weakest character, and that's only because she gets all of three-odd episodes of attention, and gleefully fulfills the stereotype of a pirate acting in her own interest, regardless of which side she's technically on.

I was also worried about the show's run -- 13 episodes can either mean a story is very rushed, or it is only partially thought out and includes a lot of filler (looking at you, Black Lagoon).  Granted, this is also dependent on the source material, and I'm not sure if Gargantia is an original anime or a manga adaptation (it's an original anime with manga supplements -- I checked).  That being said, Gargantia tells a very tight story, and very little of it seems wasted.  There is an episode dedicated to the ""Day at the Beach"" anime trope, but there is enough valuable character development in the time spent that it seems more like a break in storytelling rather than a fan service episode (of which there is a lot).

Ultimately, Gargantia ends with a fantastic twist that dramatically increases the stakes for Ledo and the future of Earth's survivors, ending in a very solid, resounding, and FINAL finale that, while it makes you want a second season, does not require one.

Chamber is, of all Gargantia's cast, perhaps the most seemingly one-dimensional character, is the heart of the show.  Chamber is adorable as the take-things-too-literally robot character, but, as he is entirely driven by logic and the policy of the military, he provides a moral antagonist to Ledo as Ledo tries adapting to his new environment and culture.  In the end, Chamber invokes memories of Spock -- the likeable ally that, on paper, you shouldn't like at all.

Overall, Gargantia is a huge and delightful surprise, not unlike Blue Submarine No. 6 or Nadesico.  The cost of this BluRay set is rather high, but given the incredible art book and the inclusion of the OVA episodes (which focus on fleshing out the Gargantia universe more) make it a better option than just watching the series on Netflix (which doesn't have the OVAs).  It would be great if Viz eventually releases a version of the series that is priced closer to the $30-40 range (standard now for most series) -- perhaps without the art book?  Ultimately, though, Gargantia is a must-have not only for mecha fans, but anime fans as a whole.",1433116800,3,3289,4.8428571428571425
6567658,4,B00MBNYKBY,"I almost gave up on this series because there wasn't a whole lot going on until you get to episode 10.  I loved this series but as one of the viewers mentioned, it might not be something you would want to buy because once you've understood how the story ends, it doesn't have the same rewatch value once you know how it ends.  I would compare this series to a film that works on character build up and ends with a bang, something like the Usual Suspects, but not quite as good.  The story starts out with space battles and ends up on Earth which has become more like Water World.  The story follows Ledo, a space solder fighting a war in space, who somehow ends up on Earth and try's to make sense of his own self being.  Now there's not a whole lot of Ledo's character development or that of the other characters, so a lot of time spent is just living life on earth and learning how the way things are.  Now, with all that said, this is definitely a series everyone should give a chance and watch once and make one's own decision.  Since I'm an anime collector, this is something I would definitely buy to add to my collection.",1432598400,,1128,4.242990654205608

6567660,5,B00MBNYKBY,"Guys let me first off say, I am 30 years old (no not the creepster type). I have been watching a lot of adult oriented, dark anime since I was 16. Don't be fooled by the cover or think this is just another mecha/teen anime. The plot is really good. The writer of Fate/Zero, Psycho-pass, and Phantom - Requiem for a Phantom wrote this story with the help of the writer who wrote Code Geass. While it is not as dark as the titles I previously mentioned, this is a very good sci-fi flick. If your wondering about fan service, its minimal.

Pros:

 Art
  Story
  Minimal fan service
  Ocean based world
  Marathon worthy

Cons:

  Plot is fairly predictable with a few twists
  Not a fan of the theme song
  Tiny bit of fan service.",1428883200,8,728,4.298507462686567

6567662,3,B00MBNYKBY,"I'll be honest. Last year when I watched this on Crunchy roll I was entranced and in love. I thought it was one of the best series ever.
Then it came out on DVD and I bought it, I was over joyed. Yes you might expect this last bit, I got it popped it in and after listening to five minutes of the horrible dub I switched it to subs. The voice acting on the dubs is not horrible but well its not great either and is kind of annoying. Once more they've done that wonderful thing of changing the dialog so the sub and dub don't match.
Outside of my griping my review is this. If you can get this series for under 20 dollars for it. It is entertaining, with thoughtful questions and is fun. However if you have seen it, or have to pay more than 20 I'd say pass. After watching it through twice, once on Crunchy and once on my dvd copy I can saw it lost a lot of its charm on the second view. It's just not good enough to watch more than once.

Bare Bones:
Good
Different story, reminds me of some old 80s anime plots
Animation is smooth and enjoyable and the music is good but not perfect.
It will provide a few laughs, a few thoughtful reprieve

Bad
Has limited re-watch value, once you've seen it you've seen it and rewatching gives you nothing new.
Sub par dubs, honestly this is not the 90s we ask nay demand decent dubs especially from voice actors as skilled as the ones on this show.

End note: The main problem this show has is a lack of length. It was an interesting world, with fascinating and potentially deep characters that could have been good for a ten hour series but instead got cramped into five.
End evaluation: If you can rent this, do, if you can get it for cheap go ahead but because of the limited rewatchability of the series I'd suggest not buying this one at full price.",1426636800,3,1792,4.1585014409221905
6567663,5,B00MBNYKBY,this is a very pleasant experience. it has robots but the story is so different than other stories that 13 eps was not enough for me. though it did end well with all the loose ends tide up it left me wanting more. it has at times a lot of bad language but it is so rare in it's plot that you tend to over look it.,1424649600,,313,3.6865671641791047
6567664,5,B00MBNYKBY,Fantastic Buy for your money and great anime to watch at least 3 times in a row.

The art book it comes with is wonderfully made and great for any collector.,1424649600,,273,4.074074074074074
6567665,5,B00MBNYKBY,"This is a beautiful series. Slice of Life Comedy with Mecha, Space, Genetic Engineering elements mix nicely for a truly memorable experience. The attention to detail is what really makes this series- characters develop not only in terms of personality, but also physically (Ledo tans as the series progresses!). I especially enjoyed their depiction of the language barrier. The English Dub is quite good, and remains close to the English subbed script in terms content and context. Light, uplifting show with fascinating plot twists.

Sidenote: Many of the other reviewers are suggesting this is harem style, but I disagree. All of the ciswoman characters have distinct personalities and storylines that do not revolve around romancing the male lead. Though Amy and Ledo have romantic elements to their relationship development, and several side characters make unreciprocated comments regarding their (physical) attraction to Ledo, the Amy-Ledo romance is only a subplot. Passes the Bechdel Test.",1423958400,3,997,5.516339869281046
6567666,5,B00MBNYKBY,"This show is great and this release is a really great deal. My only problem with it is a few of the plastic pieces holding in the DVD/BDs came broken, but thanks to how it's designed, the discs still hold in perfectly well and I haven't had one come loose despite this. Really, I think this is a fantastic show though. It's a light show with some darker elements, especially after the halfway point. I will recommend to watch the second ova before the first ova though as it's closer tied to the canon of the show and the first is standalone. This dub also deserves credit for maintaining the language barrier between the characters early on and progressively having Ledo learn and become more comfortable with the Earth language as the series goes on. This difficulty in learning the language could've easily been overlooked and had him speak normally after he starts speaking the same language but it was well worth the effort to have his difficulties be audible and I greatly appreciate it. Other than that, if you're not sure, watch some of the show on Crunchyroll, if you know what the show is and want it for collection purposes or to hear a dub, it's definitely a good buy. That said, the inside of the case may not be perfect upon purchase, but still fully functional, at least in my experience, so this release gets my approval and definite recommendation",1423872000,2,1364,4.617283950617284

6567668,5,B00MBNYKBY,"I've seen a lot of Mecha in my time, and that this show featured a giant robot and got good ratings was enough for me to want to check it out. I was surprised that is was only 13 episodes because usually a standard sci-fi is 26 episodes. There are, however, a few sci-fi classics that short, and the short length pretty much guarantees that a lot is going to be crammed into every episode. So...what did I think?

The show starts out with a huge sci-fi Mecha battle in space. There's no explanation, but the sharp direction and superb dialog very quickly make us realize what is going on. The protagonist is a soldier who lives like a machine, engineered and perfected and only awakened when he's needed to fight, then quickly put back to sleep. In today's battle things go unexpectedly, and he soon finds himself stranded in a strange environment, a fish out of water, and wondering how to get home and back to war he was created to fight.

That may be the initial premise of the show, and if that's all the show was, it would still be superb. In the English dub the perspective of the focus character is always in English, and everyone else is speaking their native language. This is absolutely fantastic. We feel as the protagonist does as everything at first seems foreign. Then we see how strange and thick-headed he seems to everyone else as he slowly tries to make sense of the new world around him and decipher the language.

The glorious colors (my wife comments ""This is a pretty show!"" in the opening space battle and the rest of the first episode), the beautiful art style (reminiscent of Gundam 00, Gurren Lagann, Zegapain, or other Sunrise shows), and fantastic music quickly draw you in and keep you watching as the story unfolds. You are very entertained. And then...

I didn't see the show going in this direction

My wife saw some of the plot twists coming, but I was downright jolted by the second half of the series. Nothing is ever really slow moving in this show to begin with (even though it somehow manages to cram in a ""beach episode""), but once things get going, they just go faster and faster. At the start I figured this was going to be a show about sea pirates and an intergalactic protector, but that wasn't even the start of things going crazy. Without giving too much away, NOTHING in this show is as it appears. Not the space empire that the protagonist came from, not the pirates, not the ship Gargantia, not the sea monsters below the waves.

Is it possible to use so many tropes that you create something completely new and original?

It's aggravating to try to describe this show really accurately, because a huge amount of the awesome comes from unexpected sci-fi tropes and plot twists. The title ship reminds me of Battle Star Galactica (with it's ""fleet"" of ships). The main character reminds me of a quiet serious space man from an old 80's sci-fi super-cheese fest. The aliens and their ultimate origins remind me of too many sci-fi to mention. There's moments in this show that remind me of Oblivion, Big Hero 6, and even Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, in the very best way possible. If you are a fan of sci-fi, it's almost impossible not to be reminded of something, but this is no criticism.

Watch It

The direction is sharp, but the writing in this show is even sharper. It is at times compelling, heart-breaking, hilarious, and inspiring. And most of all, it is very, very clever. About three quarters of the way through the show there's a character whose actions are out of character, and the show takes a sudden turn that seemed a bit strange, but the other plot twists in the show more than make up for it. Aside from that one turn that nearly jumped the shark, this show pretty much always grabs you and makes you hang on for the wild ride from that point on.

When we started watching this show we thought we would pace ourselves so that it wouldn't be over too soon. But once we started the second disc we finished it all in one shot. When the final battle gets started this show goes from good to great again and even better, feels like an absolutely fantastic sci-fi film.

The voice actors do an amazing job in the English dub. That cannot be overstated. It makes the beginning great, the middle forgivable, and the ending unbelievably awesome. Add to that some outstanding animation (except for the choppiness in the space battle of the first episode) and you have a sci-fi classic.

Watch the ending of this show on the biggest screen and best sound system you've got in the house. Thank me later.",1423094400,,4565,4.526699029126213

Despite being a sci-fi post-apocalypse mecha, the plot, storyline and characters are all very unique, both in their visuals and personality. You can't watch this expecting anything, and I'd go as far as to say Gargantia stands so very much apart from the others in this way.

To add to this, the soundtrack is incredible. By the end of the series, I was hooked on every single song that played, from the opening to the closing to the background songs. Everything seemed to flow so well together, which you don't see that too often in anime these days.

I've watched this series about 5 times since my buy, and I still can't get enough. Praise be to Gargantia!

8671471,5,B00MBNYKBY,"This series is amazing on all levels. The animation style is lush and high quality. The story is compelling. The characters are varied and intriguing. The plot interweaves elegantly and unfolds amazingly. The use of water scenery, old tech, new tech, alien tech, human tech, and the like are eye poppingly beautiful. This series is comprised of 13 episodes, but it really watches like a 6-hour movie. Like most traditional anime storytelling, it starts with a mysterious question that gets more and more clear as the story unwinds. Unlike much anime, it actually makes sense in the end. What stuns me is how much of a sense of wonder this series instills and yet how coherent the plot remains. The 80-page art book that comes with this set is a bonus treat, and the discs have extra OVA features. Treat yourself to a great series that is as good or better than ESCAFLOWNE, RAHXEPHON, KILL LA KILL, GURREN LAGANN, and SPACE DANDY.",1514332800,,929,4.7407407407407405
