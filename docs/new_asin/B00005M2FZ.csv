1624685,4,B00005M2FZ,"And another DBZ dvd hits the market. I must say that any fan of DBZ will enjoy these next few episodes because they lead up to the eventual fight we've all been waiting for. Super Saiyajin Goku vs Super Saiyajin Vegeta. The menu for this dvd is the usual standard fare. Just the usual play, chapter select, extra and language modes. In extra mode you have the usual Blue Gender previews, dbz store/web info and DBZ product commercials. I wished they'd change some of this stuff around more more per dvd. Anyways, the picture quality of this dvd is good. Much better than the older DBZ dubbed episodes which suffered from deterioration and were not even restored before transfer to dvd.",1004832000,,685,4.669421487603306
1624686,5,B00005M2FZ,"It seems over 50 people have found my DBZ reviews helpful...so here goes another one. This tape is one of the best in the DBZ library. First of all it's actually faithfully translated and action packed. For those with detective like minds you can gather from the title of ""Dark Prince Returns"" that Vegeta isn't playin nice any longer. Babidi and Dabura have sensed the evil inside him and will create Majin Vegeta-and Majin Vegeta wants only one thing-to kick Goku right square in his saiyan rump! Vegeta is off his rocker with hate and anger and Goku doesn't want to fight him but he won't back down. Tons of people felt ripped off after Vegeta and Goku drew numbers to fight in the tournament and then didn't face each other. Well, guess what folks...wait no longer...the rematch of the century begins here-no jokes, no lies. Granted it doesn't end here...hell it doesn't end for awhile. But if you miss the start...you just won't be with it. Oh and did I mention that while they are messing around, Babidi is using them to finally get the power to ressurect Majin Buu and send the world into chaos and destruction far worse than DBZ Movie 4 and all of the Ginyu Force's poses combined??? You just gotta see it...k? We Gotta Power!",997315200,32,1234,4.588235294117647
1624687,5,B00005M2FZ,"Hey, if you are curious and want to know if these episodes are worth buying... they most definatly are!  This is another great add on to your collection.  You can believe me they are not any different than the japanese versions, except the language of course.  Excitement to the very end as always!!!",997142400,,300,4.622641509433962
1624688,4,B00005M2FZ,This starts off the Buu saga which is the last saga of DBZ and these episodes are good not the best but good. But this dvd comes out after they show the episodes in cartoon network. I like the dvds cuase of the original japanese voices.you should buy this dvd if I was you.,996710400,,273,4.074074074074074
7945305,5,B00005M2FZ,"I really enjoyed this animated series.  Vageta spouts off at Gohan a little too much for my liking.  Maybe there should have been a fight between the two of them.  Of maybe, Vageta should have fought Debora after Gohan.  I bet Vageta would have been a victim as Krillen and Piccalo were.  It was painful to watch that sequence.

For me, it is extremely frustrating to see Vegeta criticize a character who brings so much to the entire Dragon Ball Z multiverse.

My review is GREAT MOVIE but a few elements could have been explored.  Of course, if they would have, we would not have had a future storyline to follow.

Once again, GREAT MOVIE!

7945306,4,B00005M2FZ,"The second to last DBZ DVD is excellent in terms of music and action.
Japanese gets an A and the english gets a C. The Japanese might have some of very funny voices but in terms of compelling music Japanese wins by far! The english has disgusting rock n' roll music. The voices of the english are horrible. They are hired amateurs who were previously with the Ringling Brothers Circus.
Japanese all they way!",1102723200,,408,4.527027027027027
7945307,5,B00005M2FZ,"I love dragonball Z. This is the best anime out there. I wish that all of their episodes were on DVD rather than on Vhs, but oh well. This is a great saga, the Babidi one. Vegeta is going back to becoming the Prince of Mean. This is what he needed to fight with Goku without any misgivings. You have to watch this! Its great.",1039046400,,325,4.015384615384615

devious. it was nice see her knee hercule in the gut. the fight between Gohan and Dabura is somewhat boring. And once again the villan makes a mistake by telling them what he is doing. despite my complaning, this is a good video and you should by it.",1017964800,2,314,4.431034482758621
7945309,5,B00005M2FZ,Gohan fights Dabura and the world tournament comes to an end.  This DVD starts getting really good towards the end when Vegeta's mind is taken over and a great scene it is.  Great menu and music.,1006732800,,195,4.388888888888889

Content: A-

Music: B+ (sub) B (dub)
English Version: B

Fight Scenes: B+
Things take a dramatic turn on this disc. As the Tenkaichi Tournment is at it's final round, 18 offers Mister Satan a helpful proposition. Meanwhile, Dabura is ready to fight. Gohan goes up against Dabura in one big brawl. Even when Goku and Vegita can sense that Gohan isn't working up to his potential, he is doing a rather well job. Just when it looks like Babidi's plans are spoiled, Babidi recalls Dabura and recruit a new warrior. Vegita. And hes mad this time.
Overall, these episodes move both slow and fast at the same time. The fight scenes were okay, but the only real fight was between Gohan and Dabura which wasn't that big of a fight. But still, it's a good disc to add to your collection. Worth watching.",1006300800,,930,4.574850299401198
7945311,5,B00005M2FZ,"This DVD is awesome! The first episode 'Pay to Win'(211) has Number 18 at the World Martial Arts Tournament, throwing the fight to the egotistical Mr. Satan for 10 Million dollars. And Babidi has sent the Evil Dabura to fight against an expectant Gohan.
Next Episode 'Heart of a Villian' (212) has the Evil Dabura and Gohan going at it like fire. Explosive action between these two super warriors. Goku and Vegeta (my favorite character) get restless and Vegeta wants to end the ongoing fight quickly. Dabura gets wind of Vegeta's highhandedness and decides to postpone the fight an Evil new plan hatching in his mind.
Episode (213)'The Dark Prince Returns'. Dabura's evil plan is revealed. Babidi plans on overtaking the Former Villian Vegeta's mind and body. Will his plans work? Can the former 'Dark Prince' resort to what he once was???
On a personal note, I love Dragon Ball Z, so I was so excited when Funimation began turning out these great episodes in its original format. Japanese dialogue and completely uncut. My personal belief is that true DBZ fan loves it in its original entirety.",1005523200,3,1096,4.866310160427807
