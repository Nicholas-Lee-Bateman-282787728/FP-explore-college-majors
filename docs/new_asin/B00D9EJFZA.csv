5784292,4,B00D9EJFZA,"Unlike at least one other reviewer, I waited to actually get this DVD before reviewing it. It is great seeing these old sci-fi movies in crystal-clear versions, rather than the multi-generational bootlegs that have proliferated over the years. The Angry Red Planet has been on DVD before, but I don't think the others have had legal releases yet. The Time Travelers is presented in 1:66-1 widescreen format, while the others are all full-screen (1:33-1). The only one that normally would've been anamorphic is ARP, but I think most people aren't going to care either way on that one. The other three movies are the reason to get this DVD.

There's no big quality loss here with four movies on one disc, and all look good on both my laptop and TV. This is definitely worth the $5 price tag (plus shipping), especially for the science fiction fan out there.",1378252800,23,855,4.738255033557047
5784293,4,B00D9EJFZA,"As a longtime fan and collector of sci-fi films, I was very surprised to see a major studio offering this collection at a dirt-cheap price.  One might expect to pay the current price ($5.00) for ONE barely-known film from public-domain outfits like Alpha Video.  But FOUR fairly well-known b-movies, from MGM, for less than the price of one?  I took a chance and pre-ordered my collection, and I'm glad I did.

""Movies 4 U: Sci-Fi Classics"" represents the major-studio DVD debut of both Beyond the Time Barrier and The Time Travelers.  Most of us collectors would gladly have paid more just to finally get good copies of these films.  The other two (Man from Planet X and Angry Red Planet) were previously released as part of MGM'S Midnite Movies series.  All four films look great.  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison of the latter two films with my Midnite Movies copies, but they seem to look just as good as the previous releases (why would the studio not use the same prints if they already owned them, right?).  This was my first time viewing The Time Travelers, and although I'd have to say it's the least of bunch (in terms of the film itself, I mean), it is the only one offered in the widescreen format.  The print used for Beyond the Time Barrier is a huge improvement over the Sinister Cinema release that's been floating around for years.

I'm also a collector of sci-fi film trailers, and I have to say I was a little disappointed that these were not included, especially since trailers were included on the MM releases, and trailers for the other 2 films are easy to find on the internet.

As for the films themselves, Angry Red Planet is certainly the best, with its far-out visuals and memorable creatures.  The Man From Planet X, although it's rarely mentioned in discussions of serious sci-fi films of its era, is also very well-made and suspenseful.  It's interesting to see veteran actor William Schallert in a rare villain role.  Beyond the Time Barrier is strictly Saturday-matinee stuff, but has plenty of action and is generally well-acted.  The Time Travelers, as stated above, is my least favorite of the four.  But it's still a fun (and very 60's) trip, and should not be overlooked.

All in all, this is a great little package for budget-minded collectors who refuse to settle for murky public-domain prints of these almost-forgotten little gems.",1378252800,61,2381,4.765853658536585
5784294,3,B00D9EJFZA,"1. The Man from Planet X -- I'd never heard of this movie. Great looking print. Extremely cute actress (Margaret Field AKA Maggie Mahoney) who, it turns out, is the mother of (extremely cute actress) Sally Field. Decent acting throughout, the plot revolves around a curious space ship in a moor and an approaching planetoid.

2. Beyond The Time Barrier -- A USAF pilot somehow encounters a wormhole in time and visits a typically bizarre 1950s futuristic civilization. Not much good to say about this movie. There's a reason I'd never heard of it.

3. The Time Travellers -- ""The plot involves a group of scientists who find their time-viewing screen allows them to travel through time."" This is a stinker.

4. The Angry Red Planet -- ""When the film was released, Eugene Archer, film critic for The New York Times, critiqued the film's special effects, writing, ""... The Angry Red Planet, solemnly warns its audiences not to go to Mars. Stubborn patrons who ignore the advice will discover that the planet looks like a cardboard illustration from Flash Gordon and is inhabited by carnivorous plants, a giant amoeba and a species resembling a three-eyed green ant."" Which is kinder that what I had to say about this movie. It really stinks.

But for five bucks? Four movies, one of which is worth watching. It could be worse.",1378252800,3,1324,4.793859649122807
5784295,5,B00D9EJFZA,"The rating is for all the movies. All are on my favorite list. But can anyone tell me if the movies are pressed dvds or DVD-R? I prefer pressed dvds as they are more reliable and more durable than dvd-r format.

Regarding some of the comments to my review, asking a technical question regarding the product isn't wrong. Many reviews comment on video and sound quality, menu design, aspect ratio, etc. Thus asking if anyone knows if this collection will be a dvd-r is fair. I wrote to the distributor of this collection and received no reply. Tried checking online, but could not find an answer thus the question in my AMZN review.

Interesting the level of angst this has generated from some comments. Now we all know there is a cottage industry of ""paid for reviews"". It's a way for distributors to generate positive ""buzz"" about their product. I suspect it's also the job of these paid shills to question anyone who asks a question or posts a negative comment for a product.",1375315200,5,976,4.603448275862069
5784296,5,B00D9EJFZA,Since the advent of DVDS I have been waiting for the release of THE TIME TRAVELERS. This little Sci-Fi gem alone is worth three times the low-budget price of this DVD set. I have bought many DVD releases from both Shout Factory and Timeless Media and have found their quality to be at a consistently high level. I can't wait to receive this set!,1375228800,21,345,4.40625

Genius.

Five stars to the four films in this collection--all are classic B sci-fi films and it's great to see them coming out together, and at a ridiculously low price.

Five stars to any other reviewer who adds another five-star review here to offset the ridiculous one-star review.",1375056000,24,407,4.785714285714286
5784298,5,B00D9EJFZA,Just took my time machine back from the future to tell you these movies are just super great and more than worth the price. Enjoy. Seriously though for the price alone for these great movies they are going to be worth it.,1374969600,20,221,4.285714285714286
5784299,1,B00D9EJFZA,"I'm hoping that these sci-fi gems are in their correct OAR(original aspect ratio) and are ""ANAMORPHIC!"" The price is so cheap that they better not be a rehash of what they've already put out!

Just received my 2 discs, one for each package (4 movies to a disc.) The first is Sci Fi Classics and contains:

The Man from Planet X-The picture is darker than the Midnight Movie print, same AR.

Beyond the Time Barrier-It's a step up from the Cheezy Flix print and both are 1.37:1.

The Time Travelers-This hasn't been released on SD yet, but the print is quite nice with good colors. It's shown at 1.66:1 and is slightly window boxed (small black lines on top and bottom.)

The Angry Red Planet-The picture is much darker than the Midnight print, colors are slightly lighter. Both are 1.37:1, but IMDB says 1.66:1?

(It has stills from all the movies in the extras section and all are quite good.)

The second is More Sci Fi Classics and contains:

The Amazing Transparent Man-Roan put out a good version, but it's much darker and this print you can see everything. It's window boxed at 1.66:1, but the Roan version is 1.85:1 (IMDB 1.85:1?)Now here's a big difference between the two and I don't know which one is correct. The MGM version starts with the opening logo, goes to some scenes and then shows the title and credits. The Roan version, starts with the logo, goes to the title and THEN goes to the scenes. I think this that's the correct way it should be seen.

Reptilicus-The picture has brighter colors and is slightly darker than The Midnight Movie version. The MGM version is zoomed in and the Midnight Movie version is zoomed out, I wonder why? The Midnight version looks the best. Both are 1.37:1.

The Neanderthal Man-Looks pretty good in 1.85:1. Nothing to compare it to.

The Brain that Wouldn't Die-The picture is zoomed in, window boxed and is 1.66:1. The Synapse version shows all the picture, is window boxed, not zoomed in and is the uncensored version...this I don't understand and I'll explain. I like the Synapse version the best.

(It has stills from all the movies and has a foreign scene in the extras section.) This is a nude scene of a model with a bunch of photographers snapping her picture. She is completely nude. In the Synapse version, it says its the uncensored edition, but this model is in a polka dotted bikini, no nudity anywhere. So how is it an uncensored version?

I bet some kid is gonna buy this and his parents are gonna raise hell when they find this out. Kinda like Swamp Thing European version. First hand knowledge. Watching with my 6 year grandson and she pops out of the water...I was so embarrassed.

All in all, both are worth the $5 apiece if only for Beyond the Time Barrier, The Amazing Transparent Man, The Time Travelers, The Neanderthal Man and of course the foreign nude scene...that lady is a beauty!!!

I compared these films in my HT thru a Epson 9500 UB PJ to a Panny BD30 and a HDA1 shown on a JKP Affinity Screen, of course both players are upscaling.",1374105600,12,3016,4.559259259259259

I enjoyed all of these the first time I saw them as a child (I graduated in 1968), when TRIPLE FEATURES
were
the norm... at DRIVE-IN ----and walk-in---- theaters.

Appropriately, it cost about a buck to see THREE movies, then... $5 for 4 ain't TOO shabby!

Thanks MGM!

5784311,5,B00D9EJFZA,"For those of you in their Senior years, sit back and remember the old Saturday Matinees at the ""Itch"".  By today's standards they are all pretty corny especially when all the scenes on Mars were shot through some sort of red chromatic enhancing lens.

I purchased this primarily for the two time travel movies which were the usual, finding the earth in atomic ruins in the future.

All in all a good buy for a rainy Saturday afternoon if you are a science fiction fan.

By the way, most movie theaters in the 1960's had no air conditioning and the seat covers were made of wool, hence most of us referred to the old movie theaters collectively as ""The Itch"".",1520121600,,658,4.458333333333333

""The Angry Red Planet"" and ""The Time Travelers"" were the two of the four that were directed by him.  Neither was all that great, but given the low budget and production time allowed for ""The Angry red Planet"", some of it is interesting to watch.

5784339,4,B00D9EJFZA,"I bought this four movie dvd for the Time Travelers, a downer of a film if there ever was one. Lots of stereotypes, and mediocre acting, but an ending that left me wondering what just happened. We watched it four days ago and are still discussing the ending. If not great, at least interesting. The Man from Planet X was laughable with the special effects including the fly by of the planet and all the disasters it caused, raging havoc on a small pile of dirt on some small island somewhere. At least it was watchable and easily forgiven for it came from the early fifties. Beyond the Time Barrier was another downer movie but again watchable. Some of the special effects were outrageous but then for the Time, probably pretty good. The ending was pretty sad. Besides the ending, what really struck me was the jet flying in outer space. I'm no rocket scientist but I'm pretty sure a jet needs some kind of air flow to function. I think. Finally, I come to the Angry Red Planet. I saw this one as a kid and thought it was not very good. Viewing it as an adult, I've changed my mind: it's carp. Garbage.the special effects are horrible. Not bad. Not cheesy. Horrible. The plot is stupid and the dialogue is so bad I could barely stand it. How did our space program pick these four cheesecakes to go on any kind of mission let alone an exploration of Mars? Maybe they hoped they wouldn't come back. Anyway they do come back with an alien creature attached to one. Quarantine him? No, that would make too much sense. This would have been a five star rating because of the other three old sci fi gems. Should have been a three movie disc or a different fourth movie.",1506470400,,1662,4.39935064935065

The result? Primo planetary whatchamacallit with some wild contraptions to tweak the oddity meters. Creepy robots and mutants who rebel. Loaded with innuendo so you can sink back and multi-level to your hearts content.

5784364,4,B00D9EJFZA,"I bought this DVD solely to get a decent copy of The Time Travelers. I admit being hesitant when I saw that four movies were crammed onto a single DVD. But the copy I had was from Youtube, and the quality was abysmal, so I wanted to get something better. To my surprise the quality of The Time Travelers on the DVD is very good. In fact, it is probably the best quality (technically) on the DVD. The colors are vibrant, the sound is clear, and the film appears to have come from a decent master. With some minimal tweaking I was able to set the contrast and brightness to what I believe it was supposed to be.

As for the other titles on the DVD, two are black and white and one is color. I never heard of the other titles, let alone watched them before getting this disc. They appear to be typical of the 1950's and 1960's sci-fi genre. Mostly low budget type films, probably what some would consider B films. I believe The Angry Red Planet has a cult following, with many people remembering the scene of the monster spider/rat creature on Mars.

All movies on the DVD are too dark. I expect the lab that created the DVD had something adjusted wrong. Since I always rip the DVD and add it to my video collection, adjusting this was not too difficult. All titles are sufficient quality to be easily watchable. But the real gem is The Time Travelers.

5784372,4,B00D9EJFZA,"You simply can't beat paying five dollars for four old Sci Fi movies. I will rate the movies below.

Best movie: The Time Travelers: This is an interesting movie with drama, action, comedy and many sexy women. I just loved the women's outfits in this movie. I was so lusting after the women. You'd have to think Star Trek got some ideas on how to use sexuality in their series from a movie like this. It also has a very good story with good acting.

Second Best Movie: Beyond The Time Barrier. An interesting movie with an interesting plot. There are many sexy women in this movie as well. Funny how both time traveling movies feature a bleak future for mankind, complete with mutants, sterile men and women, and so on.

Third Best Movie. The Man From Planet X. Now, this movie is pretty poor on many levels. It seems to be DARK though out the entire movie, even when it is the day time. The Alien is fairly ridiculous but the story is good enough. The way the alien was killed though was pretty laughable. If all aliens were only this easy to kill.

Worst Movie: The Angry Red Planet. This movie is so BORING. If you want to fall asleep, watch this dreadful movie. The worst part of this movie is that the entire movies is anti-climactic. The female astronaut retells what happened from a hospital bed. BORING!!!",1482710400,,1313,4.458333333333333

They are schlock at the very best or worst. In todays world they would never sell movie tickets. These four are all from American International Pictures. Samuel Z Arkoff was the king of schlock . He followed teenage movie trends with hot rod movies, beach party movies, science fiction and monster movies and of course, biker movies. With a few exceptions, his movies starred nobodies that were never seen or heard from again. These were great drive in movie fare usually shown with an A picture that was shown in the walk in theaters during the winter. Later they were the top attractions of every local television station's version of Creature Features at 11:30 on Saturday nights. What makes these movies great is that they bring back memories of childhood during the fifties when we all loved being scared silly at the drive ins by these movies.",1438214400,4,997,4.670454545454546

As all four movies are different, linked only by space or time, I will concentrate on ANGRY RED PLANET, one of the great memories of my childhood. The shift from most color to an all-red hue as they explore Mars was truly original for its time. I remember wondering where the credits were as a kid, only to discover that American International had saved them for the end. The bat-rat-crab-spider was one of the strangest creatures in a decade when it seemed every other movie bore some sort of strange creature.
Also, if you happened to miss MAN FROM PLANET X somewhere along the way, let me say the movie is quite atmospheric and certainly not a childish pic as the title might suggest. You will never look at Patty Duke's father the same!",1437782400,,899,4.625

5784471,3,B00D9EJFZA,"While I agree that putting 4 films on 1 dvd is a very poor choice, on my
42"" Sony CRT this also doesn't look as bad as some others have stated.
There is NO pixelisation on my system. At least it is a dual layer ""DVD9"",
which would usually have 2 films of this length; & not a single later ""DVD5"".

No they only look fair (average bit rate is around 4.5 mbs, & drops
below 2 very occasionally), but............

These are 4 mediocre films & I bought them cheap for light fun (I do
have the ""real"" MGM of Planet X), and all 4 are watchable. I found the
worst picture quality to be The Angry Red Planet (darks are too dark,
& the overwhelming red on the Martian shots whole purpose seems to
be to cover up the dreadful artwork pretending to be scenery is too
much for the print, the transfer & my TV!), but that appears to me to
be caused as much by a dreadful print than by the transfer. Though
it does look in places like it's taken from an old low bit avi.

Folks, all 4 are from AIP; this is Ed Wood style territory.

While I would never buy anything I really cared about from TMG, for what
I paid I'm content and to put it in perspective the mediocre picture
quality is still better than most double the price Alpha releases.",1429833600,,1227,4.1

MAN FROM PLANET X is a favorite film so I can't be objective about liking it's staging or the story.

I actually purchased this for the two time-traveler films, neither of which will replace similar-taled Twilight Zone episodes or George Pal & Rod Taylor's endeavor.

The picture blurs and turns into grainy squares and lines that constantly shift, its like watching a movie that has frames missing? Just tried disc in blu ray player and it looks just as terrible only now I can see the picture joggle left and right constantly? These reviews with multiple stars are by the seeing impaired or flat out liars thus why I switched to blu ray one liar claimed no compression problems when he used blu ray? No compression problems then explain to me what all the blurry patches are morphing all over my screen? Pure waste of money. Shout factory?

5784575,3,B00D9EJFZA,"Finally got around to viewing this DVD and must say, the results are rather mixed.  Content-wise all 4 of these flicks are entertaining rainy day low budget early science fiction fare.  They offer up some good-natured thrills and FX shots that only old cheapies can give you.  Plenty B movies of their day are an absolute snoozefest so I'll give this particular set of films 5 stars for the selection.

But it's certainly true the image quality leaves much to be desired; largely thanks to the silly decision of bitstarving the video by cramming over 5 hours onto 1 dual layer disc.  Most affected seem to be The Man From Planet X and The Angry Red Planet - the 2 films previously released on DVD a decade ago as part of MGMs ""Midnite Movies"" line.  Not only do they appear to get the worst of the pixelization, but they are also entirely too dark.  Some scenes are almost unwatchable as most details disappear into a black void.  I compared both of them to their Netflix streaming versions and the difference was quite literally night and day.  Using my mediocre internet connection with Netflix yielded a much better viewing experience.

The true gems on here are Beyond the Time Barrier and The Time Travelers.  They are not dark at all and seem to not suffer as much from compression in my eyes.  Time Travelers is even presented anamorphically in it's original 1.66:1 aspect ratio - something I wish was done more often in this proper manner.  As many others have noted, this is the only official release of these 2 on DVD and a worthy upgrade to almost any bootleg you'd see.

Ultimately, I wouldn't bother watching Man From Planet X or Angry Red Planet on this disc - there are better viewing options out there and they aren't costly.  I'd have much preferred if this release included just the 2 previously unreleased time travel films.  At a $5 retail price, it's worth it for those 2 as long as you keep your expectations within reason.",1406073600,8,1945,4.594202898550725

5784595,5,B00D9EJFZA,"I am an old man who used to watch cheezy movies on late night creature features every Saturday night in my pre-teens and it is something you just don't see much of anymore and it's a shame these old movies are just lots of fun.

1. The Man From Planet X - Looks really good & sounds good but does show its age with speckles and scratches yet this black & white film has fantastic black & white separation considering most of this film is very dark you would think the contrast would be muddy since Shout Factory crammed 4 films onto one DVD but that's not the case.. Looks healthy for a 51'ish film..

2. The Time Travelers - My favorite on this disc and it looks fairly decent with colors looking more saturated and deep while flesh tones are a bit on the red/baked side obviously not much care was taken during digital copy but I am happy to see something other than those VHS copies that have had their color's washed out you will find on a torrent site. It does have problems with speckles and print damage but it's hard to complain when this is the best it has ever looked even compared to the VHS which I also have in my collection.

3. Beyond The Time Barrier - Looks the roughest of the bunch with excessive speckling, print damage and contrast that at times gets muddy yet this is my 2nd favorite film on this disc it is just a cheezy funny movie that has it's corniness turned up to Mystery Science Theater levels yet it works!

4. The Angry Red Planet - This is my least favorite of the bunch even tho it was directed by the same man who created ""The Time Travelers 1964"" Ib Melchior was way ahead of his time and this film gives you a glimpse into his genius remember space travel had quite a few unknowns in 1959 yet Ib Melchior was correct most of the time about humans movement through space. The video looks good and saturation is what makes this probable the best looking of the films found on this disc. Sound is good and comes through without being drowned out by the musical score.

If you were a fan of the Creature Feature Saturday night as a child you will love these 4 films they will bring back those warm fuzzy memories of long ago!",1403136000,,2158,4.266503667481663

Many years ago, about 30 I think, I was at a friend of my parents house, they all visited and me and the kid who lived there watched tv, the parents some times would visit till very late, almost 1 in the morning sometimes. This particular night they had stayed till midnight and the local public broadcasting for the evening was a horror type show that showed B movies, and it was Angry Red Planet, well they showed the trailer and we were super excited to watch this movie!! Of course the parents decided it was time to go when the show was starting and I never saw that movie and my distaste for my parents grew in leaps and bounds.

Beyond the time barrier-- Late 50s B&W:  Kinda neat to see again after a lot of years. I think tou'll enjoy it....

Angry Red Planet (which isn't the film I thought it was) is at once the most ambitious and least successful: there's a spider-monster that's kinda cool, but all the ""Mars"" scenes have a red tint that suggests ""bad photography"" more than ""other-worldly"".

TIME TRAVELLERS tries to inject humor into the story ---- a good idea, given that the robots or androids are so lame looking.... but the effort isn't consistent, or terribly funny.

This is the first time that I have seen it released in any format. Great concept, low budget, interesting plot development. I especially liked the way the movie showed that the creatures from the future could as readily come back through the time portal as the scientists from 1964 could go forward.
One of my favorite character actors is in this movie. Jon Hoyt was great at playing the short tempered, authority, scientific figure. He was great in several of the Twilight Zone episodes.

Includes a cameo by Forry Ackerman.  In one scene, a mutant is encountered loose in the tunnels.  The actor was in fact a reportedly very bright guy with a birth defect...two-clawed hands... who approached the producers to suggest he play a mutant.  The other movies were okay...Red Planet Mars used some interesting camera effects but ultimately the ending was unsatisfying, the Man from Planet X was an interesting early scifi exercise with great atmosphere, and the other time travel movie with its twist ending is widely known but I'd never seen it.  It was all right, but I still prefer the Time Travellers which was my primnary reason for buying.  Love these 4-in-1s though. All in all, a very good collection.",1383868800,7,1004,4.876470588235295

5784706,4,B00D9EJFZA,"What's to complain about? Ib Melchior's THE TIME TRAVELERS had never been on DVD before, and is worth the price of the disc -- especially at THIS price -- by itself; and BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER is a fine late-career Edgar G. Ulmer effort (and ANY Ulmer movie is worth seeing); THE MAN FROM PLANET X is a greater Ulmer movie, and has looked better, but here it is again, and what's wrong with that? (William Schallert once told me of his delight at walking into a theater where this film was running in its initial release, in the spring of 1951, and confronting an eight-foot-tall blow-up of his own head as part of the lobby promotion for the movie, alongside those of Robert Clarke and Margaret Field . . . .); and Melchior's ANGRY RED PLANET is just plain fun. The resolution is low -- anyone with a big-screen set-up will be disappointed, but these are not exactly the movies that one watches looking for minute details, except perhaps to laugh at them. The menu pops up fast and is easy to use, and the chaptering is limited to about three for each picture, but who cares? Buy it -- enjoy it -- like the tickets you would have purchased to see them (probably for $1 or $1.50 each -- see how little has changed?) 50-60 years ago.",1381449600,3,1233,4.388646288209607

5784735,4,B00D9EJFZA,"This is a pretty good dvd set. I don't recall having seen the first three movies before, though they are fairly ordinary. Most everybody is familiar with Angry Red Planet, which has to be one of the better B movies of all time. Out of the first three movies, I found only the Time Barrier one of any real interest for me throughout, though I will say that as hokey as Time Travelers was, especially the Johnny Goes To School sort of 50's music in places, the ending was pretty interesting. Now why didn't that ending ever happen to the guys on The Time Tunnel tv series?

As far as the quality of The Angry Red Planet goes, I haven't found any pixelization at all thirty-two minutes into the film, though it hasn't been remastered at all. One thing I found rather odd about it, is it's probably the darkest print I have ever seen on my computer dvd player, and as colorful as this movie is, you sure don't expect much darkness.

I personally found the Time Barrier movie with the most interesting plot of the three non-Angry Red Planet movies, as I had difficulty figuring out who the good guys were or what the correct ultimate decision should had been. Each movie, no matter how sorry, was at least worth the $1.25 share you paid for the entire disc.",1379376000,4,1252,4.415584415584416
5784736,3,B00D9EJFZA,"Great picture quality on these four sci-fi titles. The best of the bunch is MAN FROM PLANET X.

They are all on one dual layer disc (allowing only about 2 GB disc space per title) but they all look pretty good. Only negative is that only one of the films ""The Time Travelers"" is anamorphic wide screen although three out of four were made in the wide screen era and should be presented in wide screen format, either letterbox or (preferably) anamorphic. ""Man From Planet X"" was made in 1951 before the 1953 widespread aspect ratio change so it's 1.37:1 ratio is correct. With the other two non widescreen open matte titles you can set your widescreen HDTV to ""Zoom"" (not ""Stretch"") and see them more or less as they were intended to be seen. ""Angry Red Planet"" definitely looks more grainy and soft that way though...so take your choice! Only extra is a still gallery, wish there were trailers but there aren't! I doubt we'll see these looking any better anytime soon so I'd say grab them while you have the chance...especially at this cheap price! The companion disc ""Movies 4 You - More Sci Fi Classics"" is even better with three out of four of the films (including ""Brain That Wouldn't Die""!) anamorphic wide screen!

5784741,3,B00D9EJFZA,"The good news: The Time Travelers and Beyond the Time Barrier finally get a legitimate DVD release! Will all those crummy bootleg DVDs online disappear? I hope so! (These titles are NOT in public domain, BTW, no matter what the bootleggers claim!) More good news: Time Travelers is presented in its correct 1.66:1 widescreen aspect ratio (cropped from the original 4x3 full-frame negative, as it would have been projected in theaters in 1964.)

The not-so-good news: fitting 310 minutes onto one single-sided DVD means that the encode data rate is very low. The first three films are ""okay"" looking, considering this, but the last film, the very fun Angry Red Planet, suffers from some very heavy blocking and compression artifacts in places (take a look after the 27 minute mark for some sections that are below VHS quality and break up considerably.)

I can't figure out the business decision to add two films that have been widely released before with the two that have not, and then cramming them all onto one DVD in less-than-optimal quality. What makes the decision even stranger is that the two ""new"" films, Time Travelers and Time Barrier, are sourced from really high quality recent HD film transfers, from great original film sources. Both have been available recently on either Netflix or Amazon online (in quality that seems better than on this DVD), and they show in HD on the MGM cable TV channel (not available everywhere). Are these films being ""saved"" for eventual Blu Ray release in high quality? That's the only logical reason, perhaps, for this crammed low-resolution DVD.

Still, at (about) $5 this release is welcome! But I'm betting that the vast majority of fans, like me, are more than willing to pay real money to have Time Travelers and Time Barrier on stand-alone DVD or Blu Ray in better quality.

8590939,3,B00D9EJFZA,"The Man From Planet X is an early low budget independent sci-fi film before the genre settled down into cheap exploitation in the 1950s.  Watchable, but not that memorable.
Beyond The Time Barrier was directed by legendary B-movie maven Edgar G. Ulmer on a shoestring budget using the Texas state fairgrounds as a setting.  As always, Ulmer delivers the goods with surprising aplomb, and if he doesn't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear, he at least turns in a serviceable fake leather wallet.
The Time Barrier is one of the great underrated indie sci-fi films from the early 1960s with surprising high production values and one of the all time great time loop paradox endings.
The Angry Red Planet is a gimmick film that uses solarization to hide low quality production values.",1528329600,,783,4.792592592592593
