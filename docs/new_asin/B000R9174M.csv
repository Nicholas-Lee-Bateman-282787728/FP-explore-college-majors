8199509,4,B000R9174M,"This is one of the best, that is hottest, films of this genre I have seen.  I heartily recommend it to adult males who do not need a plot to be entertained.",1395100800,,156,3.875
8199510,3,B000R9174M,"If it weren't for Tracy Ryan's exceptional beauty, I would give this video a single star. She and Toby Miller (who plays her mother) are the only actresses without breast implants, and none of the implants are attractively done. But Tracy is very pretty and has a truly spectacular natural, body--perhaps the most beautiful breasts in recent soft-core memory. (The rest of her body is equally as lovely.) The plot is shallow and barely supports a constant succession of sex scenes. It is absolutely unbelievable that Tracy's character would attempt to seduce her boyfriend's father. The sex scenes are not well done (poor direction is responsible for that). The music is harsh and distracting. For the female viewers, however, the male actors are all attractive.",1378512000,5,762,5.104
8199511,5,B000R9174M,I am a great fan of the naked female body.  Michaelangelo said it was the most beautiful of God's creations.,1367452800,4,108,4.4
8199512,5,B000R9174M,"First of all, great-looking ensemble cast, and most of them a little older. I'm no fan of Monique Parent (here credited again as ""Scarlet Johansing""...so weird), but you've got her in her full-frontal glory as well as two other older actresses who go bare. One hot younger brunette who I didn't recognize. Usual suspects among the males. The men in this film show more than in most similar films. Your girlfriend will be pleased.

Tracy Ryan is fantastic in this. Yes! I've seen a lot of her films and this one is near the top. Although this movie isn't as explicit as some of the other Image ones, we get close a few times and Tracy is the one who happily brings us there. For fans of hers this is a must-own.

Despite some instances of horrible acting, this also is an entertaining 90-minute film even beyond the sex, which is really close to wall-to-wall (like 10 scenes).",1255305600,22,875,4.531645569620253
8199513,4,B000R9174M,"I remember seeing this film several years ago on cable, and I thought it was pretty good (as far as erotic dramas, or ""Skinemax"" dramas are concerned).  So I was wary when I found it being sold on DVD in its spanish form.  Fortunately I was not disappointed.

The cover and the menu is in spanish, but someone who has extensive experience with DVD menus doesn't have to understand spanish to know ""play"" from ""set up"" from ""scene selections.""  The movie itself is in English, and the quality is excellent.  And by the way, it IS the unrated version (yipee!!)

Now on to the movie: think of it as ""American Beauty"" with tons of sex scenes.  You have your typical upper income suburban family who are as about as dysfunctional as most other families are portrayed in cinema.  You have the sexually loose drunken housewife (portrayed by the incredibly sexy Monique Parent, aka Scarlet Johansing); the clueless alpha-male ambitious cheating husband; the bratty b*tchy daughter; and the son who's the only one with some semblance of a moral compass.  The difference is that every member of the family, and their neighbors and coworkers, are about as sexy and steamy as they come.  So you have pretty much a soap opera with a plethora of nudity and sexual content, and man are they liberal with it.

Basically the son is attending law school because of his father; his real passion is art.  He knows there's more to life than making money and living a typical suburban life, but feels trapped.  The mother is a dead drunkard, who seems alive only when a young buff fella comes along or with a martini in her hand.  The father cares only about his son following in his footsteps and his wife leaving him alone, who seems alive when he's sexually engaged with his assistant.  The daughter is a spoiled brat model who uses sex to get what she wants; essentially daddy's little girl.  There's the mother/daughter neighbors who are attracted to the men in the family, and the assistant who the son is attracted to because she seems to have a semblance of a moral compass and some compassion.

The story is cliche; the characters are completely unlikeable; and if you're looking for Oscar-quality acting, writing, or direction, forget it.  This is erotic cinema; it's meant to show maximum amount of skin with story and plotline coming in second.  Once you know that, then one can appreciate the softcore genre.  That said, I was engaged in the story and the unlikeable characters.  As for the sexual content, if you are a softcore Skinemax aficionado, you will not be disappointed.  I counted 10 sex scenes (eight are boy-girl), and speaking from a male perspective, all the women are magnificent.  Whether what attributes they possess is real or not is irrelevant; it's what they can do with them is what's important.

""Close Enough to Touch"" is your standard soap opera-like drama of people despising one another while they get it on, but coupled with its high-quality softcore sex scenes, softcore viewers will not be disappointed.",1201478400,50,3023,4.780346820809249
8199514,4,B000R9174M,"Just your average dysfunctional suburban families, who happen to be neighbors sharing their beds for some lascivious fun. The movie does try to be serious by presenting a soap opera atmosphere and by giving the actors a chance to develop their characters. On the hot meter side I give it a nine, as all the actresses (Brandy Montegro,Monique Parent,Tracy Ryan,)appear hot! in this movie. Overall for the genre one of its best with Tracy Ryan contributing the most. This is probably Tracy Ryans best outing,but I wished Monique Parent appeared more. For the most part most of the sex scenes are not overly stimulating, with Tracy Ryan providing the only memorable love scenes. Overall I got the feeling the movie was trying to be more than just a soft porn film. I recommend you buy this video if you are a fan of Tracy Ryan.",1199491200,20,824,4.689655172413793
