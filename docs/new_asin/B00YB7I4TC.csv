7210846,5,B00YB7I4TC,"Recorded live at the world famous Village Vanguard jazz club in New York City, this is the quartet led by master jazz fusion composer, arranger, and guitarist John Abercrombie and it is certainly a meeting of rising stars at the time: with multiple-Grammy winning tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker, Marc Johnson of Bill Evans trio and Eliane Elias fame on contrabass, and superb drummer Peter Erskine. Abercrombie plays the Roland G-707 Guitar-Synthesizer which adds a separate layer of synth sound to the guitar sound, almost making it somewhat a quintet at times when he produces both sounds simultaneously. Abercrombie has the ability to create beautiful low-key imaginative songs, sometimes with unusual breaks in tempo, that inspire low burning or high intensity solos, so perfect for the ECM Records environment that he has recorded within for many years, sometimes with Brecker added to his trio.

 The opening blues has a unique shuffling beat with solos that grow from simple to very complex by Brecker and Abercrombie over some inventive drumming by Erskine. Marc Johnsons modal Samurai Hee Haw is filled with Japanese phrases and has very nice performances by all concerned, with an especially intense solo from Brecker, Abercrombie in synth move, and drummer Erskine. The inclusion of unnecessary 'life in Japan video footage during Breckers solo, is distracting and takes away from the jazz club experience. The gentle ballad Even Steven gets a touching performance by the trio and Look Around from the album Night is by the quartet and is perhaps the best performance of the night for Abercrombie with blazing intricate and inventive lines without the synth and with Erskine surprisingly cutting loose on sticks in an environment where some drummers might have chosen brushes. Four On One is also from Night and described by John as having a theme, then its everyone for themselves but it is not chaotic at all, heavily structured with excellent solos. This is a great performance by John Abercrombie, Michael Brecker, Marc Johnson, and Peter Erskine of fusion, bop, and beyond. Highly Recommended. Five ENGAGING Stars!

8718096,5,B00YB7I4TC,"Beginning in the mid eighties , John Abercrombie started collaborating with Marc Johnson (b) and Peter Erskine (d) on a series of trio recordings including Current Events (1985) , Getting There (1988) , the live recording John Abercrombie/Marc Johnson/Peter Erskine (1989) and November (1992) with John Surman on saxophones and clarinet . Additionally , John participated with this working trio on Makoto Ozone's Now You Know recording (1987) .
Beginning with his (1984) recording Night , John began to collaborate with Michael Brecker and utilized Mike on his (1988) Getting There recording sighted above .
Seeing as how John recorded Night with Jan Hammer (p,keyboards) and Jack DeJohnette (d) , it's a special treat to see and hear the four musicians from Getting There playing together live . It's no surprise whatsoever though that the guys sound spectacular live and that this document is a real gem . Strongly recommended . Modern creative jazz* (thanks *Ron Wynn) that stands in stark contrast to the popular music of the time .",1493510400,,1036,5.1
8718097,4,B00YB7I4TC,"Not a huge fan of the guitar synth thing back in those days, but Abercrombie's playing is stunning, as is the rest of the band's.  For the most part, he  chooses highly musical sounds, and a good variety of them, instead of opting for one sound like many others back in that era.

The only other thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is the mixing - not enough overheads on the drums.  A shame, since Peter Erskine is also completely on fire (as he almost always was it seems).

But overall, this is an inspiring performance!",1485388800,,531,4.3232323232323235
