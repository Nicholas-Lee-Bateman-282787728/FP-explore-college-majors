8378895,4,B002RVAMVW,"In recent years the Tattoo has begun alternating which service bands appear.  This was what the old Royal Tournament in London use to do.  Each year either Army, Navy or RAF bands were featured.  For the 2009 Edinburgh Tattoo the bands of the RAF were highlighted.  The bands of the RAF are often noted for their bright, crisp sound.  They usually feature a display of classic Ron Goodwin music from the BATTLE OF BRITAIN movie, as well as signature pieces with RAF associations.  This was certainly lacking in the 2009 show.

The RAF bands wanted to do something innovative and new.  They featured their Salon Orchestra with the massed band.  The music was an weird mix of New Age sounds with some classical themes thrown in. I guess the intent was to highlight Space Age type music for the 21st Century, but the result was rather flat and unappealing.  The RAF bands did not play any of their standard marches, nor even the signature RAF march.  Too bad as this rather spoiled their otherwise impressive display in the Tattoo.

How can you have an RAF Band display without the ""Dambuster's March"" by Coates, or Ron Goodwin's famous ""Aces High"". For this reason I found the 2009 Tattoo rather lacking.  I hope if the RAF bands are featured again that they opt for a more standard display of music we love and associate with them.  New Age sounds and Salon Orchestra don't go for a massed bands display at a Tattoo!",1317427200,,1415,4.608
8378896,5,B002RVAMVW,"ES un espectaculo maravilloso ver las bandas en derroche de coordinacion y destrezas. Seria bueno conseguir las ediciones de todos los aos, en especial la del ao 2004 donde una banda de noruega hace una demostracion increible",1282089600,,225,5.108108108108108
8378897,4,B002RVAMVW,"I had the pleasure of attending the 2009 Tattoo, and I feel this DVD is an excellent summary of the program. A longer DVD (maybe a set?) with the entire production would be great.",1276387200,4,179,4.294117647058823
8378898,4,B002RVAMVW,"Not enough Scotish massed bands - Swiss drum corps was awsome.  Hopefully, 2010 Tattoo will concentrate more on the mass bands/bagpipes.",1264982400,7,136,5.476190476190476
