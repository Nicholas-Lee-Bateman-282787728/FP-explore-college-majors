2219322,3,B0007LXOZU,"Mark of the Witch is abysmal. Though both movies have the kind of terrible acting that is sometimes seen as so bad it's good, in this movie it is just bad. Ludicrously OTT histrionics from the 'witch' at the start of the movie, who, with her grimacing and mouth-contorting, only succeeds in making herself look hideous and then once that is over, the action takes place at a much later time in history where the descendant of the one who betrayed her comes into it, only he's played by the same actor. The witch takes over a student, who then proceeds to spend most of the rest of the movie boring the watcher, (in this case, me) with her wooden acting. The film is just dull and only gets briefly good at the very end, and by then most people would be just past caring.
One big yawn from start to finish, and a lot of boredom to have to endure before the one brief good bit, but I guess a pretty reasonably effective ending goes some way to make up for the rest.  - Some people, of course, will give up before the end, but if you can stick it out until then, it may seem as though the rest was slowly leading up to the final good bit, which felt quite satisfying all in all.

The cover art is also pretty striking,, showing a still from the start of the movie where the witch woman's grimacing actually looks quite effective, but once seen in the movie is ridiculous.

The movie on the other side of the disc, Brides Wore Blood, had many boring sections in it, mainly the soft porn bits, and again there was a lot of laughable wooden acting, (though nothing nearly as bad as what one had to endure from the acting in Mark of the Witch) but it did have some sligthly interesting characters, in the psychic woman and the old man, both of whom were trying in their own strange way to dispel the curse on the de Lorca family.
There was also some nice gothic imagery (gargoyles and nice shots architecturally) and pretty cool mood music, (Bach's Tocata and fugue in B minor was used to good effect on the dvd menu and as the film's end theme) and some good sound-effect type music reminiscent of some of the old 'video nasty'  films, though unfortunately used here in a fight sequence mainly, when really it would have been far better employed if it had been used in some creepy scene where someone was being stalked with heavy shadows all around along a dark corrider or something, though no scene like this was shown, but the video nasty type 'music' made one think of such things. In fact, there were quite a few sequences in the movie that had a video-nasty-type look and feel about them. Not in any real sense that may have got the film banned in Britain in the 'video nasty' days, but then seeing as how some really very mild horror movies got termed video nasties and banned, then who knows? I don't recall hearing of this movie before and maybe it was just too obscure at the time for anyone to notice it. Not that it's exactly well-known now, but at least it's got itself a dvd release, albiet only on the b side of the dreadful Mark of the Witch, but some very worthwhile movies have never been released on dvd at all and to be released as the flip side of a dire movie like Mark of the Witch is better than not being released at all.

It I could give marks out of ten for either movie, I'd give 2 out of 10 for 'Witch' and 6 out of 10 for 'Brides'.
Or then again, 1 star for Mark of the Witch, and 3 stars for Brides Wore Blood, which is the main reason I am giving 3 stars anyway, and also for the fact that two movies on one disc is probably good value even if one of the movies is not up to much.",1251158400,,3606,4.21273516642547

8048604,5,B0007LXOZU,"MARK OF THE WITCH is an independent US horror flick from 1970 that just about gets by despite the entire lack of budget and talent behind the camera. The film follows a bunch of dated college students as they become convinced that one of their peers is the reincarnation of a witch who died some 300 years previously, swearing revenge on her persecutors. It's mainly a static and talky little enterprise, but it does manage to build up a relatively fair head of steam along the way, and the ritualistic moments, although limited, tend to hit home. The spooky storyline brings to mind the likes of CITY OF THE DEAD and the actors certainly work hard to invest in the tale.",1523145600,,671,4.553719008264463

8048609,5,B0007LXOZU,"A woman / witch in tarantula-like eyelashes gives a very animated / maniacal speech, before being hanged. This happened in olden times. Zoom forward to modern days, and a young woman named Jill (Anitra Walsh) buys a mysterious book, before going to a big college bash, where the students drink beer, use ouija boards, play w/ Tarot cards, and read palms for fun. Enter Mac Stuart (Robert Elston), who is very interested in Jill's book, which happens to be filled w/ spells, including one for summoning witches! ""Oh, why not?"", say the thrill-seeking kids! Within seconds, it's lights out, candles on, and here comes the mumbo jumbo! Slack-jawed young people watch, as Jill rambles on w/ her recitations and incantations. Oh no! Something's happened to Jill! She's different, somehow. She now speaks in a strange, affected voice, instead of her usual, groovy lingo! Yes indeed, Jill's been possessed by the witch from the introduction! Dear lord! Jill kills Mac's dog! Yep, Mac Stuart is a descendant of one of the people who hung the witch, 300 years prior. Now, Mac must help Jill to fulfill the witch's curse, but first, he must teach her what a coffee pot is for! Jill's boyfriend, Alan (Darryl Wells) doesn't believe in witches. That is, until Jill makes a parakeet explode, like a feathery grenade! Can Mac and Alan stop Jill, before she wreaks her terrible, witch-y vengeance? They'd better hurry, since Jill has started yelling malarky and causing a hullabaloo in the back yard! While wearing a kickin', blue mini-dress! Too late! She's got the girls out! Meanwhile, Mac and Alan have a long, in depth discussion about attempting to come to some conclusion about what exactly to do, in order to take action about their witch problem. Jill sets out to seduce and kill her victims. This isn't difficult, since the college seems to only attract students of the vacuum-skulled variety. Much hideous hyperbole, emoting, and stylish branding follows! The bodies pile up, as Jill does her best to reduce the world's airhead population. MARK OF THE WITCH (1970) is a rib-tickler from start to finish! Jill's cackle alone, is enough to make this a classic! Do! Not! Miss! The big Beelzebub vs. Jeezuz, cross-eyed Jill, flashing disco crucifix, bloody kiss, time traveling finale! It will pickle your soul...",1519689600,5,2305,4.958656330749354
8048610,4,B0007LXOZU,"Upon seeing this movie ""mark of the witch"" on youtube the other day i gotta say i was slightly impressed, this really is NOT as bad as the other reviewers suggest. Don't get me wrong this movie did have it's LOW points and did come off quite boring at times but it did NOT in anyway suck completely. The problems with the mark of the witch was that it was quite campy in that 70's style and also did become very laughable at times when watching the witch initiate people into the coven and worship satan and thing's of that nature.
To warn fellow horror movie buffs of the other low points of this movie, was that in general the acting wasn't that great and there was very little character development, i'm not sure why maybe because it was low budget. During the course of this movie there was also LOW impact scares, the suspense and HORROR was non-existent but overall if you could look beyond all that this movie should make for a decent flick. The good things about this movie, the ONLY saving grace was the storyline which made for an entertaining perspective. I do find it interesting rather that a few reviewers have mentioned another movie ""devil times five"" which i previously watched prior before watching this, which was also good and for some odd reason came to my mind when watching this film. I would totally recommend people watch that movie as well. Depending on your taste as a horror fan will determine whether or not this movie ""mark of the witch"" is for you but most likely will be for the old school horror movie fan.",1402704000,,1539,4.480427046263345
8048611,1,B0007LXOZU,"Don't waste your time watching this poor excuse for a movie. Even ignoring the very poor quality of the film to digital transfer and the missing sections, this is a D- effort at storytelling and cinematography.",1368921600,,210,4.861111111111111
8048612,4,B0007LXOZU,"This movie seems slow at times, but it's worth the watch if you like old school movies. It is poorly edited to save time, and it's a pretty cheesy movie over all, but it seemed to have some actual spell ingredients (minus the powdered bat wing, etc.) and the end gave me the willies.",1296950400,2,283,4.2592592592592595
