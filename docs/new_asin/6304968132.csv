7880610,2,6304968132,"This is a second trainig film by Jim Cirillo, a veteran of 17 gunfights. Although the subtitle of the film says that this is an advanced film, the techniques presented here are not necessarily very advanced, but rather intermediate level.
This film covers many topics, like training for reality, downed officer defence, geometric point shooting technique, low light shooting, and so on. The problem is that the film is mainly a hodgepodge of different, separate tricks and techniques. I would have preferred if Cirillo had presented a clear, total system of self defence shooting, but instead he has chosen to cover varied topics, and some of them are given just a glance; maybe a minute or even less.
Some of the things Cirillo covers are very good (like the fact that you should integrate armed and unarmed defence into a total package, or that you should modify the techniques to suit your individual needs and limitations), but some things don't even belong into this tape, in my opinion (like the 5 minutes Cirillo uses to demonstrate a 6 mm x 45 rifle his friend has developed - it may be a good rifle, but otherwise this has been a handgun tape. And they don't even teach any techniques for the rifle, they just tell about a rifle Cirillo's friend has developed). But the major downside of the film is that Cirillo teaches some techniques that are not very good (like an obsolete flashlight shooting technique), or are downright dangerous (like using tracer ammunition to illuminate the target, which requires you to shoot first without identifying the target - you could be shooting your own family member, or a responding police officer!).
As I said in the beginning, the techniques are not necessarily very advanced. But no beginner should see this tape, before he has acquired enough knowledge and experience to be able judge himself whether a given technique is good or not.
