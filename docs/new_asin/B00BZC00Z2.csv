5683093,1,B00BZC00Z2,"I want to be very clear that I'm not giving this product a bad review because of the series itself. ""El Patrn del Mal"" is an AWESOME series that deserves to be seen everywhere. It's well done, well acted, and very entertaining.

The reason why I'm giving this product a one star rating is because the quality of the DVD's is staggeringly bad. I bought three box sets of this series and ALL of them came scratched and with some unplayable discs. I bought ALL of them brand new, with cellophane wrapper and everything. Never been used, yet they were all scratched. I bought Volume 1 first, obviously, and had to return it. I got the exchanged copies and had the same problem. I also ordered, from a different seller, Volume 2 and, yet again, it came scratched.

If you're going to watch them on your computer, then they might work. But if you plan to watch them on your TV, I recommend you stay away from this box set. It's a damn shame too because it's affordable and the episodes look great (when you can see them).",1379030400,14,1015,4.3936170212765955
5683094,5,B00BZC00Z2,"I stumbled across ""Pablo Escobar: El Patron Del Mal Part 2"" at the local Wal-Mart for a scant $5 and was so intrigued that I came on Amazon to search for the other parts. If I had to pick a word to describe this mini-series, it would have to be FASCINATING. It was quite intriguing to see how Escobar went from a charismatic youth searching for his piece of the world to the human piece of garbage he became at the end of his life. I must admit, I'm half-way done with Part 3, but I couldn't contain my excitement.

The only bad things I have to say about this mini-series is that it at times jumped around, making it hard to follow; however, it was quite easy to ""catch up,"" so to say. As for the DVDs themselves, the separate ""seasons"" are subtitled. If you are a non-Spanish speaker or have a rudimentary knowledge of the language this is good. If you are fluent, then you will find some discrepancies between the Spanish dialogue and the translation. Some are laughable and others will make Spanish speakers cringe. Still, not enough to make me rate this series any lower than 5 stars.

Overall, ""Pablo Escobar: El Patron Del Mal"" is an outstanding addition to any crime-drama collection.",1378252800,,1192,4.488479262672811

5683096,4,B00BZC00Z2,"First, let me say that the series itself deserves 5 stars. It's a great story, and the series does a fine job of showing the many sides of Pablo Escobar (charismatic leader, banal egotist with mama issues, most intelligent bandido in Colombia, liar and murderer with absolutely no conscience, best boss in the world--if you're from the barrio and don't expect to live past 25), and of Colombian society at the time (a full spectrum from cowardice to courage, endemic corruption to stirring idealism, with every possible nuance in between).  I'm using the series as a tool for learning Spanish, and so I watch each episode multiple times, and the lively cinematography and sharp acting keep my eyes interested--which would not be true for most telenovelas.
But as for the DVD itself--
Pros--
-The picture is good. Solid 720p. Once in awhile, there's a digital artifact that looks like the sharpen filter in photoshop, but on the whole, it looks quite good.
Neutral--
-The episodes have been re-edited in about 42 minute chunks.  It's different from both the original Colombian episode numbering, and from the Telemundo (USA) TV version. Maybe this is the Mexican edit.
Cons--
-The audio is highly compressed, and almost a mono mix.  The theme song, for example, becomes very annoying in this mix (I like the song a lot in better-quality audio).  In one or two episodes so far, the audio was seriously distorted.
-The menus use the same pictures from the title sequence over and over--not images from the actual episodes. This makes it hard to navigate.
-And as for the main reason to buy this particular DVD edition--the subtitles in English--they seem to have been generated by an automatic translation engine, and then lightly touched up by an underpaid editor who doesn't know the original story (or maybe takes a lot of naps).  The subtitles frequently mis-translate Spanish pronouns (""su"" can mean either ""his"", ""hers"", or ""yours"", and the subtitles usually just say ""his"").  The character Marcos Herber, who in the story prefers to be called by his last name, is translated as ""Herbert"" or ""Helbert"",  ""verraco"" (""tough"" or ""tough guy"") becomes ""berraco"", Escobar's maternal family name,""Gavira,"" is often randomly translated as ""Gabira""--and so on.  For someone who understands about 50% of the Spanish (like me) it's not bad, (actually, for a language student, an overly literal translation can be helpful) but it might be a challenge for someone with no Spanish at all, especially when the pronouns are way off.  I wish that the producers of the DVD had used the much more accurate English subtitles from the Telemundo broadcast (which is what I'm comparing it to). But this is an inexpensive, legal edition (I hope!)--and for now, it's the only way for English speakers to watch the show.
So three stars for the el cheapo DVD production values, five stars for the show itself, which means an average of four stars.",1373241600,2,2923,4.961145194274029
5683097,5,B00BZC00Z2,"... or the series that makes the Sopranos look like the Golden Girls. ""Pablo Escobar, el patrn del mal"" is a colombian mini-series about the life of the most notorious drug lord of the last part of the 20th Century. For this series every effort was made; shooting on real locations, using helicopters, and is for a great part shot in exteriors as opposed to the interior studios used for most Latin American telenovelas. What sets this series apart from most of the other ""based on a true story"" series, is that the actors chosen, do resemble the actual people they are portraying (if not physically, at least in the way they talk). The most stunning revelation is Andrs Parra in the role of Escobar, who not only looks like him physically, but actually speaks just like him. It's uncanny! so much that whenever he'd go out in the streets dressed as Escobar, people would gather around him calling him ""Pablo!"" and cheering him. Which by the way, shows how a psychotic criminal like Escobar is still adored by thousands (let's hope not millions) of people to this day.

The series was co-created and co-produced by one of the sons of Guillermo Cano, the publisher of the colombian newspaper El Espectador, and one of the few journalists who wasn't afraid to attack Escobar and expose him for what he really was. Mr. Cano ended paying his affront when he was murdered on orders by Escobar. The purpose of the series then was to remind the people and tell the younger generation of what sort of a criminal Escobar really was, and hope that the ""history won't repeat itself"".

For those who still don't know him, Escobar single-handedly took control of the cocaine business throughout the world, made millions of dollars (Forbes put him among the 10 richest men in the world at the time), had thousands of cops killed under his orders, not to mention presidential candidates, judges, magistrates and journalists, and even sent a guerrilla movement to attack the Justice Palace just so that they would burn any documents that might implicate him vis-a-vis with the Colombian justice. As if that weren't enough, he even blew up a jet airliner in mid-air with all its passengers just because he thought a political candidate he didn't like was aboard, and then started bombing the country until the government would give him immunity and not extradite him to the US (what all Colombian drug traffickers feared the most). In other words, the sort of guy you don't mess with.

As such, this series, made up of 73 episodes of 45 minutes each (this first part contains only the first 25 episodes, parts 2 and 3 will follow shortly after) tells the true life story of this drug kingpin from his childhood all the way until his death. What's so fascinating about his life, is that it would put even the craziest among the Roman emperors to shame. The Italian Mafia even seems benign compared to what this man did. Though the series aims to show how evil this man really was, many people all over Latin America still revere him as a god. He has also served as an inspiration to the actual Mexican cartels due to his sheer ruthlessness towards those who betrayed him.

Now, getting on with the series in hand. Please note that though it's based on fact, many of the character's names have been changed due to legal reasons or mainly because they aren't anymore among us and their families didn't give permission to use their real names. So it'd be good to check the webpage in Wikipedia dedicated to this series if you want to know who is who in real life. As is, it's still a story that will shock you. I can't think of anyone cheering Escobar's atrocious acts, yet at certain points many did, but toward the end of the series you'll be left feeling sick about what this man actually achieved. Don't forget that though he amassed millions of dollars, he died penniless. So a lesson is to be learnt here somehow.

As I mentioned in the beginning of my review, this is a first-rate series, and you can see that a lot of care and money was put into it. However, this being a period piece (ending in the early 90's), many chronological misplacings slipped through: PC computers being used at a time when there weren't any, flat-screen tv's are seen in some homes, not to mention Guitar Hero video games with their respective guitars in the room of Escobar's son (they only appeared in the 21st Century). I'm sure people living in Colombia might have spot a couple more. But this chronologigal mistakes aside, the series really packs a wallop. All the actors are well chosen and play their parts perfectly (and hundreds of actors were used in the cast).

This DVD set comes with English subtitles, for those who don't speak any Spanish, though much of the Colombian argot is lost in the translation. For those who are into gangster movies, this is the one that outdoes them all, mainly because it's based on the true story of the most ruthless gangster that ever lived!

Highly recommended!",1371686400,5,4972,4.6560364464692485
5683098,5,B00BZC00Z2,"With good award winning team: actors, directors, etc and a great production.!
Its a very well represented portrait of the events that took the world by surprise
The Power, money and violence storm to gain control by the Drug lords and many high ranked corrupt Politicians together in teams for a bigger share of the Market against honest law enforcements heroes, with no real support of the higher ranks who benefit from the drug business that is why it is better for them to let it be unregulated, like in the Alcohol Prohibition times in the US.
This Production work is a series that has many hours of great entertainment, which the audience will very much enjoy.
Together with other series that has being recently produced by the same team they are a broader sequence of this interesting story that has affected so many people in the world today.
It help to understand the inside of this entire phenomenon caused by a series of mistaken policies and Laws that the result is against the People, but very profitable to many high ranking politicians.",1370390400,3,1050,4.743169398907104

5683100,5,B00BZC00Z2,"Having heard fantastic reviews of Caracol's production of 'Escobar - El Patron Del Mal' from several disparate sources, I was hugely dissapointed in the initial North American DVD release (Complete 15 DVD Set - $89.90/- on Amazon) which was by all accounts a largely 'no frills' affair - no Bonus Features, no Featurettes, no 'Making of' videos, no Cast / Director Interviews, and perhaps most glaringly, the ommission of English Subtitles (in an all-Spanish affair).

This re-release of the mini-series by distributor 'Distrimax' seems to correct one critical miscue of the first set - the inclusion of English Subtitles. However, there is still no information on any additonal features or bonus content. Additionally, this DVD set is being released in parts with Part 1 above(5 DVD set), and an expected Part 2 (5 DVDs) and Part 3 (5 DVDs) to follow. It is unclear as to the release dates for the 2nd and 3rd parts.

Details include:

Title: Escobar - El Patron Del Mal - Part 1 (5 DVDs)
Studio: Distrimax
DVD Release Date: 5/7/2013
Rating: Unrated
Region: 1 (North America Only)
Language: Spanish WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES
Cost: $12.73 (for Part 1) from Amazon, Walmart and Target

CONCLUSION: In closing, for $12.73/- for Part 1 (with an expected total cost of ~$37/- for the entire three-part set) and the critical inclusion of English Subtitles, this is clearly the best version of the mini-series available to date. However, with no information on release dates for Part 2 or Part 3, and the continuing lack of bonus features, it is probably worth waiting to pick this up (at least until all 3 parts are released, or ideally for a box set with bonus features). That said, the annecdotal evidence is that this remains one of the best made crime operas of recent years with a phenomenal turn by lead actor Andres Parra in the role of Escobar. Based on historical fact, investigative journalism and thousands of hours of interviews, this biopic is laced with threads of social injustice, economic realities, oppression, intimidation, corruption, convoluted politics, crime, excess, and violence at its most barbaric. This is the story of Colombia's darkest days and its most (in)famous son.",1368057600,6,2191,5.010989010989011

Amazing how Mr. Escobar can be so charming and the next minute so evil.

As far as the box set goes, it's good enough to buy without regrets but very much a barebones effort, would have loved extras. In short, average release of an absolutely amazing show.
