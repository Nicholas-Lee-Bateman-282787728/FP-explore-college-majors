3663296,5,B001K3JS7W,"Crawford far exceeded my stereotypical expecations of a documentary in this, to say the least, politically engaging time. It is a fair, balanced view of the past 8 years from the perspective of the people of Crawford. These people are colorful, multi-faceted and far beyond just ""small town."" They reach into the hearts and minds of people everywhere. I laughed, cried and came out feeling like I had come to understand just that much more about our country. It is an incredible piece of history that is not to be missed.

Not to mention the incredible dvd extras!! This is well worth the dime, and is a must share. I invited a few people over to watch it, and it turned into a Texas-sized gathering. It makes a great gathering, that's for sure. I'll be putting some in the mail for the holidays. Excellent work, thank you!",1227657600,,823,4.598639455782313
3663297,5,B001K3JS7W,"I watched a pre-screening of CRAWFORD at the Boston Independent Film Festival, found that it far exceeded my expectations and have since purchased the DVD. The film was all at once informing, entertaining and touching - and in a very personal way. I found myself blurting out laughter, fighting off tears and engaging in the very satisfying laugh-cry combination. The film tells an important story about the impact of George Bush's arrival on the town of Crawford, which is a microcosm of small-town America, and Crawford's story in many ways seems to be an analogue to Bush's impact on America more broadly. Small-town America is often referenced (or dismissed) with respect to its 'helping Bush get elected'. CRAWFORD compelled me to reconsider the broad-brush manner in which small town America has been painted in the recent past as the film renders a far more in-depth, thoughtful and even-handed picture of a very important part of our country and our world. Take a look and see for yourself. It's a must-see for sure.",1225843200,9,1024,4.959302325581396
8314234,4,B001K3JS7W,"It was amazing to see how easily a little town can be twisted and turned simply by having ""greatness"" in their midst.  GWB was NOT a hero and he used this town to his advantage for political gain....and then left.  Boom to bust.  The SHAME is that the people in that town voted for this man because they saw his media image, not who he really is.  Sad for the town.  Sad for the people.  Sad because they made choices and followed GWB right off the cliff.",1427155200,,455,4.172413793103448
8314235,5,B001K3JS7W,This movie far exceeded my expectations and covers a small town's brush with celebrity status in sometimes unexpected ways. The movie is nicely balanced across the political spectrum and enjoyable by anyone having an open mind.,1369785600,,227,5.333333333333333
8314236,5,B001K3JS7W,"Loved it. Bought 4 DVDs for gifts. Big change in small town life brought to life, complete with unexpected event.",1229126400,,113,4.7
8314237,5,B001K3JS7W,"Well, that's what I take home from David Modigliani's terrific documentary, anyway. I first saw it at Netroots Nation in Austin, where I also got to meet the filmmaker and several of his associates. I watched it online at [...]. I bought the 2-disk special edition, And I've picked up a copy of the festival cut to give as a Christmas gift.

Mr. Bush, his gang of sycophants, and some network/cable hairhats are all peripheral characters in this film. The real story here is the one Modigliani tells about the people who lived in Crawford long before the circus arrived.

Watch this film, and get to know them. You'll be better for it.",1229040000,,635,4.610619469026549
8314238,5,B001K3JS7W,"Watching ""Crawford,"" you'll learn things you hadn't known, and in what I believe is a rather unbiased manner.  Furthermore, Modigliani somehow weaves an element of drama into this documentary that puts you on the edge of your seat.  Regardless of whether or not you're a documentary-type, ""Crawford"" will grab you. No doubt.",1229040000,,324,5.211538461538462
8314239,5,B001K3JS7W,"A brilliant film from a promising first time film maker.  Watch so you can tell your friends ""I remember Modigliani's first movie.""",1229040000,,131,4.954545454545454
8314240,5,B001K3JS7W,"I had a chance to see this on the big screen in Austin, and I thought it was a beautiful piece of storytelling.  The doc chooses the right people, the right moments, and the right place to tell its story, not only of Crawford's turn in the spotlight but also of small town life in general, a life, lives actually, that may get passed over if you only stop to admire the kitsch in the souvenir shop.  The editing is superb; the film coheres more than other place-based films, and the people interviewed are alternately funny, insightful, and moving.  Get a copy while the gettin's good -- you won't find a Pug Meyers among the neighbors surrounding GWB's new 3.7 million dollar estate in Dallas.",1229040000,,694,4.536
8314241,5,B001K3JS7W,Excellent film.  Very fairly documented.  David and team let the citizens of Crawford tell their story.  I encourage everyone to watch this movie.,1229040000,,146,5.260869565217392
8314242,5,B001K3JS7W,"Encountering this film at Netroots Nation, a convention of the liberalest bloggers ever, I thought it might contain a fair amount of the heavy-handed Bush-bashing I've come to know. Well, it didn't.

Crawford is a balanced and compassionate portrait of everyday Americans living their lives in a town that happened to be adopted by a president. The film works because the filmmakers built trust with the residents of Crawford, and it shows.",1229040000,3,440,5.111111111111111
8314243,5,B001K3JS7W,"A really unbiased entertaining presentation of the people of Crawford, with excellent character development. This is a really good movie, and I highly recommend it.",1229040000,2,164,5.6
