8627673,5,B00GUREXAK,"This original one woman show is not only entertaining, it is informative. From Dorothy Parker's many accomplishments (The Algonquin Round Table, Anti-Nazi League, Nomination for an Academy Award, founding the Screen Writers Guild) to her downfall during the McCarthy Hearings and Hollywood Blacklisting, I was fascinated with her story from beginning to end. The author expertly weaves memorable songs throughout (Room Enough For Two, the Algonquin Round Table, Opening Night On Broadway, Hemingway's Theme, Hollywood Holidays, etc) with both humor and pathos... Highly entertaining.",1404345600,,583,5.9523809523809526
