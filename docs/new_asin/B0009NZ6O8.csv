2307338,5,B0009NZ6O8,"I was delighted with this little film. Made for TV back when, she is just wonderful. Her medical issues do not even matter due to her mannerisms and wise ways. I love the way she went to live with a ""normal family"" who wasn't so normal after all but after she got through with them, they were. It was great. It let me see that love, time and attention given to children and even to adults, they can change and become more than they ever dreamed possible. This is one of those feel-good films that makes you want to watch it again and again. For $1.99 it is a bargain. High recommended!",1382918400,,585,4.232142857142857

2307343,4,B0009NZ6O8,"As a Hepburn fan I really enjoyed this film. Hepburn as usual plays herself, and having read many  books about this wonderful actress I realised just how much like herself is Laura Lansing.

2307344,3,B0009NZ6O8,"Four-time Academy Award winner Katharine Hepburn was in her early 80s when she made this television movie in 1988.  After she won her fourth Oscar for ""On Golden Pond"" (1981) she did nothing for three years until she made ""The Ultimate Solution of Grace Quigley"" (1984), and then a couple of years later she started making movies for television periodically.  ""Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry"" (1986), ""Laura Lansing Slept Here"" (1988),"" ""The Man Upstairs"" (1992), ""This Can't Be Love"" (1994) and ""One Christmas"" (1994).  In between those last two she made her last theatrical film, when she upstaged Warren Beatty and the luminous Annette Benning in ""Love Affair.""  None of these television movies matched Hepburn's earlier efforts on the small screen, such as ""Love Among the Ruins"" and ""The Corn in Green,"" but they gave the legendary actress something to do.

Hepburn plays the title character, a wealthy and world famous novelist who is shocked when she is told that her publisher has turned down her latest book.  Her agent (Lee Richardson) suggests that she should retire because clearly she has lost touch with her readers.  Lansing thinks otherwise and makes the bet that she can live with a typical family in the suburbs for seven days.  If she cannot survive such a mundane existence then she will give up writing forever.  So the great Laura Lansing shows up at the home of Walter (Joel Higgins) and Melody Gomphers (Karen Austin), and immediately takes over the place.  Having spent decades being waited on hand and foot, she expects the Gomphers to do the same.

However, when she is informed she cannot have the bathroom all to herself because it is the only one in the house, she shows she is willing to be accommodating by drawing up a strict schedule assigning everybody a specific time they may have it use.  Meanwhile she refuses to let anybody watch any television, will not let the kids listen to their music, and threatens the baby when he dares to cry in her presence.  Of course, this is only the first part of the story, where the unwanted guest turns the life of the entire Gomphers family upside down.  But in the second act she will start helping them with their various problems, including the fact that Walter is paying attention to the Xerox girl at work while Melody dreams of the sexiest man on soaps (Nicolas Surovy), who just happens to be a friend of Laura's.  Will this jeopardize her bet or simply given Laura Lansing the material for her best novel in years?

That was a rhetorical question.  ""Laura Lansing Slept Here"" is a pretty predictable, but Hepburn must have liked screenwriter James Prideaux because he wrote the script for not only this television movie but also ""Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry"" and ""The Man Upstairs"" (writing television movies for Katharine Hepburn is not a bad gig).  All three movies were directed by George Schaefer as well, so there must have been a high comfort level.  Unfortunately none of the cast is anywhere near the same level as Katharine Hepburn, although Austin is certainly game (her character faints on meeting Lansing, not because she had read any of Lansing's books but because she has seen the writer on talk shows and she scares here).

The most interesting scenes are between Hepburn and Schuyler Grant, who plays the Gomphers daughter Annette.  Some will recognize Grant from the ""Anne of Green Gables"" mini-series or even from ""All My Children,"" but she also happens to be Hepburn's great-niece (Hepburn's sister Marion married Ellsworth Grant, and their children included Katharine Houghton [Grant], who was with her aunt Kath in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" and Jack Grant, Schuyler's father).  Maybe it is just me, but it sure seems that Hepburn saves her best moments for her scenes with her great-niece and you end up wishing that there was more for the two of them to do together because it would have made for a much better movie.  But the early scenes where Lansing takes over just strike me as more mean-spirited than funny, so I end up rounding down on content myself with knowing there are a whole lot of better Katharine Hepburn movies out there.

With the release of ""Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry"" and ""Laura Lansing Slept Here,"" my collection of Katharine Hepburn movies is now complete.  The rest of her television movies have previously been released on video, and while not all of her theatrical movies are still available I have copies of all of them (yes, even ""The Iron Petticoat,"" the travesty she did with Bob Hope).  ""Mrs. Delafield"" is the better of the two, helped by both a more intelligent script and the interesting choice of Harold Gould as Hepburn's leading man.  But for fans of Hepburn the thought of not having something in our movie collection is unthinkable and these DVDs are reasonably priced.  However, there are no extras and the scene selection menu is one screen with the titles of chapters appearing around Hepburn's picture.",1123632000,21,4960,4.83096926713948

Hot Toasty Rag, November 7, 2017

Even if youve never seen Katharine Hepburn in a film when shes younger, youll absolutely fall in love with her in Laura Lansing Slept Here. Shes an adorable little old lady, with spunk and charm twice as large as her stature. She plays a famous romance novelist who gets sucked into a bet by her publisher, Lee Richardson. Lee accuses her of being out of touch with her readers and challengers her to survive for one week in a normal familys home. For their trouble, the family will be paid $500 per day. How lucky, to get $3500 and spend a week with Katharine Hepburn!

The family is struggling for money, the teenage daughter Schuyler Grant has attitude, the husband Joel Higgins is distracted by a floozy at the office, and the wife Karen Austin lets her appearance take third priority to raising their three children and being mindful of their pocketbook. When Kate moves in, theres only the slightest adjustment period before she starts improving everyones lives. While the story might give you a little cavity, I find the sweetness charming. Kate is adorable; where would the fun be in portraying her as an unreasonable grouch? Its much more enjoyable to see her helping out and making a difference. She truly is delightful, and there are several scenes where youll want to reach into your television and give her a big hug. For Kate Hepburn fans, this is a must-see. For others, its still a must-see. Youll probably become a fan after the first ten minutes.",1510012800,,1533,4.695167286245353

8064457,3,B0009NZ6O8,"Bought this because, after all, it's Katharine Hepburn. But it's a predictable TV-movie in the style of that era -- the 1980s. The music is jarringly TV sitcom-ish. The characters are one-dimensional; no surprises. I resist giving this fewer stars because... after all... it's Katharine Hepburn. If you're a die-hard fan, then add this to your collection in good conscience. However, one viewing was enough for me; I won't be keeping it on my shelf.",1407542400,,449,5.0
8064458,5,B0009NZ6O8,"I am an avid admirer of Katherine Hepburn and have yet to see a movie of her that is not a favorite. When i saw this on sale the DVD was chosen simply because of her.
After that all was splendid! The price , condition, delivery and I will order from this site again. No Problems whatsoever. Though I do believe someone is making serious money on shipping and handling! LOL
I am not sure I care to have my stuff""handled"" and ""ships"" are out of the question! Wouldn`t mailing be more convenient and cost effective for most products?
But this is a standard set by someone in the sky that simply takes advantage of us all and truly prevents me from doing very little shopping on line because I can go to a store and get it for the effort of walking in the door and carrying it home. Senior limited income restricts many people not just me!
Now here is a little irritation for Amazon, I am not a novelist and have no desire to write a novel on how I feel about a website and purchase.  But they require ""20"" more words every time I try to submit! What is with that? LOL LOL",1402444800,,1068,4.159420289855072
