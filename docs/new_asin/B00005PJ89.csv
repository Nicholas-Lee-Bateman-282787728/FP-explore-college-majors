7949288,4,B00005PJ89,"I like the Tony Hawk's Trick Tips series--they're not as systematic or precise as Dan McFarlane's Skateboarding Explained, and they come with a lot of fluff, but that's part of what makes them engaging.

This particular video stands out because it introduces vert skateboarding, which is neglected by nearly all other instructional videos. Vert ramp skating is not the same as mini ramp skating, and it's great to see Tony, Bucky, and Riley show how to get started.",1296950400,,465,4.961538461538462
7949289,5,B00005PJ89,"This inspirational DVD is the best thing on market, even if the tricks on this DVD are sometimes tremendous difficulty. With Tony Hawk, Eric Koston and Colin McKay it's an inspiration to continue skating.
If you want to be a well rounded skater, the best thing to do is buy this DVD, watch it and keep watching it until you get all the tricks on this DVD.
Another thing SMILE!!!!!",1039737600,7,380,4.442857142857143

7949291,5,B00005PJ89,"Good for the beginner skateboarder and his / her family.  Also helpful to the more experieced boarder - good safety tips.
Informational and useful to the family member that is not the skateboarder.
Nice DVD.",1019174400,8,207,4.914285714285715
7949292,5,B00005PJ89,"I'm an old skool dawg who skated nothing but Tony Hawk decks back in the day, so any DVD with Tony on it is a MUST-HAVE!  As for the content, there are 21 tricks in all.  Rail tricks include:  feeble grind, frontside smith grind, frontside boardslide, backside lipslide, frontside noseslide.  Flipping tricks include:  backside 180 kickflip, frontside 180 kickflip, varial kickflip, 360 flip, frontside 180 heelflip, backside 180 heelflip, varial heelflip, hardflip.  Ramp tricks include:  axle stall, 50-50 grind, pivot, 5-0 grind, frontside ollie, fakie disaster, frontside disaster, backside disaster.
As for the format, the DVD is set up much like Vol. 1.  Chapter advance on your remote will bring you straight to the next trick.  There are sub-menus to help you navigate as well.  In my opinion, Eric Koston is a great sk8er, but his comedy needs MUCH work.  His antics get to be really annoying after a while.  Now the StyLiN' tips by Colin McKay was funny!  Colin basically teaches you how to be a poser heheh.  Tony's son Riley is in the video; he helps demonstrate the frontside ollie on the ramp.  And what a ramp!!!  Bob Burnquist's private backyard half-pipe/bowl hybrid thang.
Get this DVD and be amazed how someone 6'3"" with size 13 shoes can manipulate a skateboard.  Ok, so Tony can't do the backside 180 heelflip... or can he???  Just watch the credits and cheer!!!  Yay!!!",1004227200,23,1391,4.918103448275862
