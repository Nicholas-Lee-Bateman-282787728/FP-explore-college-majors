7120229,5,B00W5J5EQY,"There is only one match on this card that is kind of....a meh. Roman Reigns continues to fail to impress as a singles competitor. Otherwise, this is a really strong special event from the WWE. Sheamus vs. Orton is very physical. It's what I have come to expect from both Sheamus and Orton. It was a great start to the night. After the NXT Divas made their RAW debut, they made their PPV debut and showed that they are not hype, they are the real deal. It's the best Divas match in a long, long time. The match of the night is Cena vs. KO. Brock Lesnar gets his rematch against Seth Rollins. To steal a line from Cole, it's ""vintage Lesnar"" until a deadman makes his return, looking for violent retribution.

7120230,4,B00W5J5EQY,"The Randy Orton-Sheamus match was a good match with several believable nearfalls and the crowd was into it probably because Orton is from St. Louis. The tag team title match between The Prime Time Players (Darren Young & Titus ONeil) & The New Day (Kofi Kingston & Big E.) was an average tag match where both teams worked hard and the champs were able to win because they stopped Woods from interfering too much. The Roman Reigns-Bray Wyatt match was too slow early, but they really picked up the pace and had some really good nearfalls in the second half of the match. The fans really bought into it. The Sasha Banks-Charlotte-Brie Bella-3-way match was a very good match by the ladies. That was longer than most divas matches on PPV because they usually get 5-7 minutes. Thats a great sign that shows WWE is serious about treating their womens division seriously. It also showed that not only do Charlotte and Sasha belong, but they are arguably the best divas on the main roster already. The US title match between John Cena & Kevin Owens was another fantastic match by Cena and Owens. Im running out of things to say about them because they always deliver great matches. It was great like their other matches and they did a lot of things in the match that were similar to those matches. The World title match between Seth Rollins & Brock Lesnar was short and only remembered for Undertaker's appearance. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1437523200,,1438,4.577519379844961

Tag Titles: Prime Time Players vs. The New Day- Fun match with a fun ending sequence. Best part was Xavier woods. 3/5

7120232,4,B00W5J5EQY,"Sheamus vs Orton: Orton won with a RKO out of nowhere.
  New Day vs PrimeTime Players: Titus pinned Big E with his finisher.
  Triple Threat 6 Diva Tag: Charlotte made Brie tap to a Figure Four.
  Owens vs Cena 3 (U.S Title): In Vince's mind it must not only be 2005 but 1999 as well since Stone Cold is on the cover of WWE 2K16. Anyway as if it was 2005 Cena made Owens tap to the STF. Cena was allowed to look strong and pass out to Rusev's Aculade. Why couldn't of Owen's have passed out to Cena's STF ?
  Or better off why did Cena have to win ? Owens was just named wrestler of the year so far. Vince can't allow that because he lives in the past and wants people to name Cena wrestler of the year. When it's time to stop milking his bad gimmick and make him heel.
  Otherwise it wasn't a bad match. But why does Cena have to win all his feuds ? I guess if Owens does win the U.S title it will only be by pinning someone other than Cena in a Triple Threat match. Except Kevin Dunn one of the guys in charge doesn't think Owens has the look and got in Vince's ear that Owen's should lose. Meanwhile Owens was just named wrestler of the year so far by RollingStone.
  Wyatt vs Reigns: Luke Harper helped Bray get the win with Sister Abrigal.
  The Miz who no one cares about got knocked out by Big Show in a segment no one cares about.
  Lesnar vs Rollins (WWE Title): WWE isn't great with secrets. It was reported all week Undertaker would appear and cause Brock the match. And yes he appeared and caused a DQ when Brock hit the F5 on Rollins. Undertaker then tombstoned Brock more than once.",1437350400,,1596,4.1

8712186,3,B00W5J5EQY,"WWE Battleground '15, a PPV in a joint production of both main and development rosters. I think it was cool, well not so fast!
The Prime Time Players are on a roll, the WWE Diva Wars had begun, and the conclusion of the Owens/Cena Trilogy for the US Title flopped big time.
Randy Orton wins again, Bray Wyatt reigns supreme like Leatherface, and the WWE Intercontinental Title Match got cancelled.

It's ok, The Undertaker turned heel for the first time in 15 years by destroying Brock Lesnar with Tombstone Piledrivers that caused the WWE Title match to end by DQ. Seth Rollins wins. His previous heel turn happened on the Raw after Survivor Series 2001, in case your wondering.",1440892800,,679,4.705882352941177
8712187,3,B00W5J5EQY,"Randy Orton vs. Sheamus - Orton returns to his hometown of St. Louis as Sheamus focused on the midsection while Orton worked over the back area with both men using grounded offense along with coming off the ropes & taking the match to the outside using the ringside environment more than once along with trading fist & forearms along with having counters & blocks to each other's signature moves in what Michael Cole called perfectly on commentary, ""a physical match.""

Tag Team Champions Prime Time Players vs. New Day - Kofi & Big E. represented New Day as this was pretty much your ""tag team wrestling 101"" encounter with New Day singling out one opponent & using their numbers advantage when possible keeping him in their half of the ring in the corner while Woods on the outside made his presence felt either verbally or physically when possible while the PTP played to their strengths while taking advantage of the mistiming of their opponents in a solid encounter but nothing different than we haven't seen before from these teams.

Roman Reigns vs. Bray Wyatt - Reigns started out very strong going right after him including sending him to the barricade on the outside while Wyatt was able to use Reigns momentum against him sending him into the steel steps to get the advantage in his favor while continuing to stay one step ahead of Reigns by using his offense against him along with using his body & weight as a weapon itself only for Roman to come back countering Wyatt with some impactful offense himself in what was a solid encounter.

Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Brie Bella - The ""divas revolution"" that started a week earlier resulted in this match with a candidate from each team meeting here in this match that definitely had some highlights such as a ""like father, like daughter"" moment with Charlotte only to be topped later with a ""like husband, like wife"" series of offense from Brie and the double stomp in the corner by Sasha that had a domino effect on her opponents as the main strategy here was that one diva was the odd woman out attempting to take her out of the contest so the other two can concentrate on each other along with the other divas at ringside getting caught up in the action as well in a good match between all three with the NXT girls only scratching the surface of what they're capable of doing causing Brie to step up her game in her best performance in recent memory.

United States Champion John Cena vs. Kevin Owens - This was the rubber match with the difference being that Owens is no longer the NXT Champion while Cena was defending his title with Owens coming out strong with a knockout punch & torture rack neckbreaker while Cena had a unique faceplant slam & top rope legdrop as both men traded momentum countering & blocking the other's offense with one man stealing the other's moveset at one point as they continued to have innovative combinations or counters rarely seen from each other before such as a superplex countered into a mid-air side suplex or powerbomb into a rana in such a hard fought match that you saw both men show signs of frustration thinking ""what else can I do?"" in what was another show stealing performance from both men in these series of match.

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Brock Lesnar - Brock came right after Seth who was doing whatever he could to avoid ""Suplex City"" from going to the outside to grabbing onto whatever he could before he was eventually caught with a series of suplexes while Brock also showcased his athleticism by hurdling over one of the barricades just to get him before Seth was able to break Brock down focusing on a specific part of his body with various strikes while also repeatedly going to the same offense just to keep Lesnar off his game in what was a short match but good for what it was but ultimately was just the background to the faceoff that's been 17 months in the making.

The preshow match featured R-Truth vs. King Barrett (again). This was a solid show with some good action so in the end, it's worth watching a replay on the network & for a rental/steam at best.",1438560000,,4095,4.57980900409277
