2304887,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I love this series.  It was all too sad for me when it ended.  I have been waiting for three years for this season to come out.  From the first episode of season one, you are addicted to Roswell.  To a little cafe called the Crashdown and the UFO museum across the street.  To a group of teenagers who become bonded in one way or another.  A bond closer than blood family.  To Maria, Liz, Isabel, Michael, Max, poor Alex (who is only a sad ghost in this season), Kyle, Valenti, and even Tess.  Michael and Maria are my favortie couple. Liz and Max have a love that does not seem able to fade..a love that can bring you to tears with all of the loss and grief they share.  This show can still bring me to tears over certain episodes.

This show is just as powerful to me now, as it was while on the air.  I now will search for movies that have these stars in them just so i can get a glimsp of ""Isabel""  (who ironically is in Grey's Anatomy playing a character called Isabel Stevens.  In Roswell her character is Isabel Evans.  Think she had any trouble getting used to her character's name?  ha,ha)  However i have not found any other show that grips me such as Roswell.  Even my four year old asks me to watch ""your alien show"". The funny thing to me is that i am not an alien person.  I never really watched X-files or anything, i don't get into Star Trek/Wars, etc.  I have never been one to watch alien shows before.  But there is something about Roswell, some kind of magic that just enchants you from the beginning.  But don't take my word for it..watch it yourself.  You will see.

Majandra, Brenden, Jason, Shiri, Katherine..thanks so much for the show!",1117497600,8,1661,4.270096463022508
2304888,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Season three of this incredibly emotional series is definitely bitter sweet for many ""Roswell"" fans. The series ends with the memorable quote by Liz, but it will take everything imaginable for the gang to find a sense of security and purpose that is finally achieved in the last episode. This journey has it's surprises, it has it's mysteries and definite heartache...but even though the characters are so tormented by change and life decisions they never lose sight of each other.

Max and Liz will experience the essence of forbidden love at the hands of their parents. Isabel will finally open up her heart to love, but in the process open doors to her past. Michael and Maria will confront the tests of self-discovery that will either tare them apart or make their bond closer than ever. Kyle (the definite comic relief within the weight of drama) will finally discover his true self-worth. A definite dynamic turn from his season one character. You will get a sense that each character has grown, that each has discovered a little bit more of themselves through the eyes of those they love. Each character will be pushed in terms of trust, faithfulness and ultimate sacrifice. I urge you to not to miss out on the conclusion of this captivating story because there are moments that are pure poetry within the maze of sci-fi action and fantasy that will take your breath away and remind you, once again, why you love Jason Katims, and the whole writing team who gave us characters we will always cherish.

""Thank-you For Visiting ROSWELL!"" - You won't regret it!",1116806400,12,1566,4.796296296296297
2304889,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I watched Roswell from the beginning on the WB, it is the best show ever!!  It is still my absolutely FAVORITE TV show, you will LOVE Roswell if you have not seen it!  The first episode captures your heart and takes you on an awesome journey through the lives of some normal, (and some not-so-normal) high school kids.  It is a sci-fi Romeo & Juliette!!

I miss Roswell so much, get the DVDs if you have not seen them, you won't be disappointed!!  Plus, the more people that buy the DVD the better chance we have of getting a movie!!  I LOVE ROSWELL & YOU WILL TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1116460800,5,590,4.4672897196261685
2304890,5,B0009NZ2RY,I love this show! It is my favorite show ever! I'm also a huge Buffy fan so If you like that stuff you'll love this too. Roswell has such an interesting genre...It has such characters that you get so attatched to. I own the 1st two seasons and my room is filled with roswell stuff and the books are great too. I give this show 5 stars!,1116460800,4,335,4.014925373134329
2304891,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Woo-hoo...after looking at this, I feel so hyped up of the new release of 'Roswell Season 3' on DVD. I've been waiting for  this release for soo long, and it's finally going to happen on August 9, 2005. All I know is that the collectible five-disc box set includes all 18 episodes from the third and final season of the cult television phenomenon, following the alien trio and their handful of loyal human friends as the Air Force and FBI close in. The main cast of season 3 is Max, Isabel and Michael. As they prepare to leave Roswell behind, Liz has a shocking vision which makes everyone realize that it is not only the aliens who are in danger but their human friends as well. Some bonus material includes select episode commentaries, ""Class of 2002"" featurette, ""Shiri Appleby's DVD Tour to Japan"" featurette and new cutting-edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team. All I know is that we can preorder it on Amazon beginning July 13, 2005 for $59.98. Anyways, I can't wait!!! Let the journey continue....",1116201600,4,1023,4.683333333333334
2304892,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I first watched season 1 of Roswell after purchasing the DVD set early last year. Since then I have became one of the shows biggest fans. Now after a long wait the release of Roswell Season 3 the Final Chapter will be released on August 9, 2005. I was a bit concerned that the third season would not be as good as the first or second, but to my surprise it was just as good if not better. Roswell is still one of my favorite TV shows. Like the first and second season, season 3 still has a bit of a love story to it, but also keeps that sci-fi feel to it. I have to say I have never cared much for sci-fi series but Roswell is so much more than just that. Like the wonderful first and second season, this third season still takes you on a emotional journey. As you go through each episode you still find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. The sad thing is unlike the previous seasons the characters are not always hanging out together at the crash down caf. They are doing their own things which is a bit hard for me because I was so accustomed to them being together but I guess it is just part of them growing up. For me Season 3 is much more emotional because I enjoyed this show so much and it was hard to let it go. I have discovered one of the best shows with Roswell, and I can not wait till this final Roswell season 3 set is released on DVD on August 9 2005.

There were some good moments in this season, and I liked the fact there was a final episode rather than leaving us hanging. I just had the feeling it could have been a much better season. For instance, the episode where they had Izzy's life playing like an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" but as an alien was just annoying. But Max and Liz end up together, and Michael has a bigger heart than he lets on. I love a happy ending.",1456617600,,586,3.9745762711864407

2305181,3,B0009NZ2RY,I came a little late to the game since I just watched the whole series now but I enjoyed the first two seasons very much. The third season was still pretty good but pretty different than the first two.,1445558400,,201,4.17948717948718
2305182,1,B0009NZ2RY,"Season 3 is more lust and less deep feeling between Liz and Max, the main characters that drive the show. Both characters seem rougher with Liz becoming a risk taker and up for anything. They get a sexual thrill from committing a fake armed robbery at a convenience store and stealing an alien artifact thought to be a jewel at a society gala, which felt contrived and way out of character for Liz for whom getting older seems to mean giving up who she is and too much of her innocent quality which inspired trust.  And Max, after losing his virginity to another alien who then gets pregnant, seems to just want to get physical with Liz after this sexual experience with someone else - a real turnoff; he now seems a lot more down to earth as the typical male teen who only thinks about sex. Innuendo and sexual themes become more part of the show overall, and Liz and Max' special relationship which potentially could have made for great romance was traded for shock storylines which really affected the heart of the show. These characters  got thrown under the bus - I guess romance wasn't really the aim of the show. The specialness of their relationship to viewers didn't seem to be shared by the show's makers who in this season seem to go off-planet to a world that's a little too alien for me to connect to. Rating 2 out of 5 for visual quality.",1445558400,,1352,4.44758064516129

2305578,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I'm betting many put this show in a category and dismiss the story as one of adolescent love and overly simplified happy endings.  But I never heard of the show and was surprised I even liked it when starting to stream old episodes.  In the end I see a short run of a show that had a lot of layers questioning and while fictional and based on high school at least attempting to be deeper than many much more intense shows.  While 3 seasons is not a lot, in about 60 episodes I was pleased to be entertained by a story with science fiction, and one of prevailing hope.  While there are holes and room for criticism I'll simply take what it brought to the table and be pleased that it surprised me in getting me hooked to begin with, but in the end simply telling a story ending with on a simple, positive and hopeful note.  The show could have been many things, but of the paths available I think they did a good job of telling an enjoyable story that only had two ways to end and they took the right way.  Doubt there will ever be an outcry for a continuation or follow-up because adding any more would take away from what it left its viewers with, endless possibilities.  So any more would have been subtraction by addition.  I'm sad it's over, but glad I got to enjoy it.",1419552000,,1273,4.231404958677686

2305643,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Very entertaining storyline about human/alien hybrids living here on earth among us.  Each episode typically links to the next or is relevant in some way to a future episode.  There are some good cliff hangers and overall the acting is good.  Liz and Max are cheesy at times, but because their characters are in high school, I have to remember how cheesy I was back then when I was in the dating phase. I'll warn you this series is addictive once you get past the pilot and 2 more episodes...you'll be hooked, but you'll enjoy it.  The only downside is you will feel the pain of the bad choices some of the characters make (repeatedly) but I suppose that's what good acting is all about...right?",1412121600,,695,4.536

2 main characters (the actor & actress) could have been swapped out for better, as it seems they are both 'muted' in their acting abilities compared to their co-stars and even many supporting actors/actresses.",1410393600,,434,4.786666666666667

2305743,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Ok, sure this season had some disappointing episodes, such as the first four episodes and the episode ""I married an alien."" But, all of the other episodes are pretty good.  In fact some of the episodes of this season are among the best out of all of the three seasons of Roswell.  For example the episode ""Panacea"" has you almost glued to your seat because of what happens to Max and Isabel.  In later episodes, we also get to find out what happens to Tess, Max's son, and what happens to everyone in the group.  With this in mind, any Roswell fan must get this season because it has a lot of amazing episodes.  I have to add too that the last two discs of season 3 has the BEST EPISODES out of all three seasons - there is tons of action, suspense, drama, and sci-fi.  And after watching season 3 I am sad that fans cannot continue to watch the continuing adventures of all of our favorite characters in a season 4 that never came about because viewership dropped.",1401321600,,965,4.333333333333333

2305864,5,B0009NZ2RY,"First let me say that I'm  huge fan of the Roswell series, all of it. The only thing I don't like about season three is that it didn't run 22 episodes, only 18. This is a real shame since they had introduced a couple of really interesting story arcs that never got a chance to see completion. Season 3 has some really standout episodes including my favorite single episode, A Tale of Two Parties. Another good arc are the 3 episodes where Liz leaves Roswell and Max for boarding school in Vermont spoiler, Max dies! You'll have to watch it to see what happens in the end. This show had some really great characters that you wind up rooting for and the writing was first rate with good story arcs.

It didn't leave me wondering what happened to everyone...and yet, didn't exactly leave me knowing either.  This whole Roswell series was a joy to watch for the entire three season run.  Season 3 is a fitting way to end one of my favorite tv shows ever...and I started watching the very very earliest ones.  Wonderful show.  EVERYONE should watch this show if they love fantasy, sci-fi, romance, or thrillers.  Roswell is truly a winner from the pilot until the very last episode.

2305936,5,B0009NZ2RY,"i was not happy with season 3 at first. oh man i hated it. max came in looking like a heroin addict, the sci fi was seriously lacking (ok my extent of television is star trek, big bang and dr who, im kind of a sci fi geek) and frankly i couldn't figure out where the directors were going with this season. it had at the beginning lost its flavor and its edge was lack of a better word corrny.  it took a few episodes and then i realised that it was going to just be a weird season and it was. it didn't move hard at the beginning. frankly it barely moved at all.

it gave closure and believe me the sci fi comes in in its own time. not to sound like a total sap but i was misty eyed for the last part of it because you really know whats got to happen.
when this show started (season one)  i liked max and liz (and then as time progressed they were kinda getting on my nerves but as time progressed in season 3 i was back liking them again. i always loved maria and michael. to the last episode they were my favorite 2 characters in the series. kyle shocked me. i couldn't stand him in the beginning but by the 3rd season he was at my top 4. i love the growth i saw in kyle. okay the budist jokes could be funny but he did grow with it. when season one started out kyle velinti didn't care about anyone but himself, only stood up for what he was raised with and was a geniun towney douchebag but he grew into a hero of sorts who (though she killed alex)) opened his heart to tess. i couldn't stand velenti but by 3 he had totally jeopordized everything for the ""pod squad"", isabel aka the christmas nazi remained one of my favorite characters and max, well max became more likeable to me.

okay basic summary of 3. it starts real slow. (i almost fell asleep first ep and almost said ""this episode sucks im so done"" max and liz rob a convinience store because they have located the original crash ship and the key. max wants to go back to antar and get his baby who he believes in calling out to him. isabel has met jesse, a human who she is very much in love with and who loves her but he has no idea she is an alien. michael is still skidding around like hes on ice with maria and shes trying to figure out if this is really the life she wants and michael still struggles with his lack of power in the family. liz has began to show powers due to max saving her and she tries to change her life <yeah like thats gonna happen> due to which kyle is just counting the days til he starts to crack snapple and pop like tin foil in a microwave. velenti has lost everything and hes gotta find out the next step. maria is pushed to give her music the old one two punch.
season 3 is all about closure and the fbi is in full force (yes it takes a while)

i grew to love season 3 but at first i couldn't stand it.
stick with it.
its different but its still roswell. i couldn't have ended it better.

Finally we get the last season and it seems they ran out of ideas. what do they do? pick the hot chick and conjure up a stories about her for the rest of the season.

A new main character, Jesse is introduced, but in the end his character lends absolutely nothing to the program. The episode ""Chant Down Babylon"" is probably the worst of the season - if not the series. and takes the show to a whole new level of bizarre.

The reason I give the final season five stars is because the show ended well. All of the loose ends are tied up - and there is a ""final"" episode. The fans weren't left hanging - as is the case when so many series are cancelled.",1237680000,2,588,4.394495412844036

2306046,4,B0009NZ2RY,"With these simple words came the end of the phenomenon that was ""Roswell"", quite simply one of the greatest science-fiction shows to ever exist. To be a true Roswellian in this day and age is quite something - most of us who followed the show the first time around are older (and hopefully wiser), but we can still watch these episodes back to back despite being completely out of the age group of the leads on the show. Such is the timelessness of ""Roswell"". Through the years, its' fanbase has grown and grown, and if there is one TV-on-DVD that you need to own other than ""Firefly"", then this is it.

Season Three, while being certainly less well-written than the first Season (which remains a classic season, and clearly the best season of Roswell), is essential, because its interesting to see how they tie up the loose ends. Even as a loyal fan of the series, I was disappointed at how rushed some storylines were, and how so many stories were left incomplete or conveniently forgotten about. For example, one of the greatly anticipated storylines carried over from Season One, is when the Alien Mother visits them and tells them to save their home planet. Of course by Season Three, no one seems to care about the home planet or going back, as they all choose to retain their human sides. Fine, but for fans who wanted closure, this season really skimped on that.

The final three episodes were the most infuriating. One of the most discussed storylines was of Max's alien son, but in the end, the baby appeared only for one episode, and Max quickly gives the baby up for adoption. This was very weird, and very poorly thought out. It almost destroyed the series for me. The other thing was Katherine Heigl's character. She went from a fierce and stable woman to a simpering, whimpering waif, and this transition was not at all appreciated, or even interesting. What happened to the Isabel of the first season?

The final episode has the entire group and their significant others leaving Roswell for good, without even saying goodbye to their families. Max and Liz finally do get married - their wedding is the last scene in the film as they all board a van to go off someplace. This is poignant, yes, but its also shocking at how much of a backstory was promised by the writers, and how little we actually got. Can't blame the makers though - they probably tried their best.

As a long time Roswellian, the Third Season frustrated me, like it did a lot of hardcore Roswell fans. Our favorite characters deserved better ends, and Isabel especially deserved more happiness than what she got here. Still, as a wonderful depiction of teen love and angst, this season had a good blend of both, and despite being really low on the 'science fiction' element (you can tell they were working with almost no budget on this one), it still oddly works.

Three and Half Stars. This series could have been so much more. But thanks for the memories, Roswell. You were one in a million.",1207526400,,2978,4.621928166351607

2306049,5,B0009NZ2RY,"When Graduation was shown on our screens and we finally knew that it was the end of the road for our gang of aliens and their human supporters, well - we wept.  And then we realised that at some point it would be out on vhs or dvd and we rejoiced!!

After a dire season 2, it was important for season 3 to be remembered for all the right reasons and it was!

The last season of Roswell is beautifully written, shot and directed.

You can even tell that the cast are back on board after some extremely wooden performances in season 2 - this isn't negative, it just always seemed to me that they didn't agree with the direction of season 2, but for season 3 they are back on form!!

The love story is again the central part of the make-up of this season and for that I think we are all grateful!

For me the best part of the season is most certainly the way Liz starts to develop her own powers and the way it shakes her to the core - making her doubt everything.  Liz's best line has to be: ""Get up b*tch!"" which she yells at Tess after discovering the murderer in Michaels house. - Classic!

However the winner for me has to be the way that after three seasons we finally see that the most 'alien' of the group - Michael, finally understands that its his human side that makes him strong and in the end keeps the group alive.",1197504000,2,1325,4.128404669260701

BOO-Hiss to the idiots that wouldn't pick up this program.  I would like to know just who provides the ratings.

The Final chapters of ""Roswell"" remain true to the characters and their problems they have to deal with in their world.
Dad Evans sure stirred up a bit of trouble.
Yuck to the blonde bimbo who tried to save her old man husband and then ended up in bed with the visual Max. By the way was Valenti going to get any powers from being saved.  How about Kyle?

Liz had to kill Max?  That was earth shattering.  <g> He just keeps getting better in every episode.

It was great the way Tess showed up back on earth with Zan, Max's son. And boy, did she protect the child.  I almost felt sorry for her but am glad she went the way she did.

That whole alien session was great - the hunt and determination of the FBI? to find the alien, or were they looking for more than one.

Graduation started the countdown - the FBI didn't have a chance on closing the net.  Can Isabel find her way back to Jesse?  What was to be the future statis of Michael and Marie?  Was Kyle and his father allowed to get any powers?  Will Zan come looking for Max in the future?  And how big a family will Max and Liz have in the years to come?

How about a movie as the kids [now adults]make a flying visit back through Roswell under the nose of the now unbelieving government.

Ah well, all good things must come to an end, it is just hard to let go.

2306079,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Roswell is still one of the best shows to have been on television. I watched, and was hooked, from the very beginning and have followed it from network to network. I still watch it on the Sci-Fi channel for the original music. For many fans who watched Roswell beginning in 1999, the music replacements on the DVDs are mostly disappointing. A few scenes that stand out for me are the beginning of Heat Wave (Santana/Everlast--Put Your Lights On), Alex's strip tease in Surprise (Quad City DJs) and any scene with Sarah McLachlan and Counting Crows songs. There are many more, of course, but those are a few which most lost the feeling and mood of the original episode. On their own, I think a lot of the replacement songs are great but in the context of Roswell, many of them just don't hold up to the original.

It is for this reason that I have started a petition to get Roswell re-released in high definition with ALL of the original music--Roswell on Blu-ray disc, DVD or HD DVD with the original music and more extras. Keywords: Roswell on DVD the Right Way.

Please note: I don't make any money from this and will be paying for such a re-release just like the rest of you. Buy the DVDs from Amazon.com (I did) and watch the original episodes on the Sci-Fi channel for comparison--the music matters.",1174608000,4,1304,4.54468085106383

2306129,3,B0009NZ2RY,"The third season of Roswell was the worst to me because it felt like they were trying to wrap it up too quickly. Someone mentioned how several plot lines were started and not completed I don't agree. The episode in which Max jumps into the lake and has a violent reaction is pretty clear he think his son was contacting him. The plot of Liz's powers were simply her surpressing her anger and that anger being manifested into an alien like power. The series had so much potential and it's sad that it ended with them completely forgetting the plea of their true mother to comeback and save thier home planet. They instead choose to give up thier throne and bum around the earth so called helping those in need...what a waste. I was one that loved the sci-fi part of this story and I would have enjoyed seeing how they would eventually get back to their home planet and reclaim thier throne. I hated the ending although cute not very fulfilling. They should have done maybe a narrative stating how yes they traveled the world for a while helping others but eventually found a way to get back to thier home plant Antar and bring peace. Also I hated how poor Isabel was destined to be an old maid while stuck on earth never being allowed to have a permanent relationship. It's sad that a good show like this had to end so quickly, but I do think the writers did a good job of wrapping up the loose ends in the time frame they were given to work.",1149724800,4,1441,4.340740740740741
2306130,4,B0009NZ2RY,"For its 2001-2002 season UPN wanted to upgrade its schedule and appeal more to a younger age group and to this end pulled off one of the bigger TV shockers of the new century and outbid the WB for BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Less publicized and apparently less well thought out was its acquisition of ROSWELL, which most people thought was going to be cancelled at the end of its second season.  Unfortunately, on UPN the show was never given a real chance to succeed, the network interfering considerably with the show concept and presentation.

For context, BUFFY had established a new way of doing a television show for a prime time non-soap:  featuring a single arc over the course of a single season.  ROSWELL was one of the first shows to come along after BUFFY to benefit from this new way of doing narrative on TV.  In contrast, shows from the eighties that features multiple arcs that continued over multiple episodes really didn't attempt to engage in a master story arc.  Season One of ROSWELL was a wonderful piece of narrative story telling, with one episode flowing smoothly into another to tell a story that continued past one episode into the next.  Season Two started breaking up the narrative a bit, engaging in smaller arcs and in more stand alone episodes, but still the emphasis was in telling a big story.  Unfortunately, some of the arcs of Season Two were simply terrible, especially the revelation that our alien teens were actually royalty.  Season Three largely and happily abandoned most of the Royal Family nonsense and refocused the stories on the lives in Roswell of the aliens and their friends.  As a result, there was a greatly improved tone to the show in Season Three over Season Two.  Unfortunately, however, almost all longer arcs were abandoned at network insistence, so there is a sense that the final season really wasn't telling a story in the way that the first two seasons did.

Then, of course, UPN pulled the plug.  Not only that, they failed to order a full 22-episode season, leaving the show almost no episodes to wrap up the series.  Unfortunately, the show ends with a host of dangling plot lines and beginnings of stories that would never get told.  For instance, early in the season Liz and Max go after an alien space ship that is being housed under a convenience story.  Obviously, they weren't able to pick that back up later.  Also early in the season, Max and Liz are at a lake and Max jumps in, only to react violently to something in the lake.  Again, this was never picked up on later.  During the course of the season Liz seems to be gaining some powers of her own, but this never gets integrated into the show, nor do we find out whether Kyle, who also had been healed of a mortal wound by Max, would develop powers of his own.  As the show wound down, they had to decide both how to wrap things up as elegantly as possible and which of the dangling arcs they would deal with.  The next to last episode deal with the biggest plotline:  Max's son.  Unfortunately giving only one episode made it feel like it was being dealt with too quickly.  This is hardly the fault of the show's writers and creators, but of UPN by not giving them the extra episodes needed to wrap things up properly.

Another major plot line of Season Three that does gets wrapped up, though a bit too quickly for my taste, was the investigation of Max by his father.  Sensing that there are things about Max that need explaining, he begins prying into Max's life on a level he hadn't before.  Eventually things are brought to a head when they spy on Isabel and capture on film her engaging in telekinetic activity.  One would have liked this to be stretched out a bit longer.

Still, given the restrictions placed on them, everyone involved managed to make a number of excellent episodes and end the series on a strong note.  Most fans like the way that Max and Liz manage to get together in the final season, though Liz's father makes things difficult for the first half of the season.  Parents play a big role in Season Three, despite the fact that both Liz and Maria's mothers disappear.  John Doe played a much larger role than in the first two seasons, though I have to add that I was always mystified that they didn't try to employ his musical ability more (for those who don't know, he was the front man for the legendary LA punk band X and has a notable solo career as well).  He did strum a guitar in one Season Three episode.  Not everything in the season was peachy, however.  I never warmed up to Adam Rodriguez as Isabel's new husband Jesse Ramirez.  He just never seemed to fit in the show very well.

So, Season Three brought the story of three aliens living in Roswell and the friendships they made there to an end.  Given the low ratings is it hard to see how UPN could have justified renewing the show for another season, but it is just terrible that they didn't give them a full season to do a less rushed job of wrapping the show up.  However, one has to add that given the small amount of forewarning they did a good job.  The last episode leaves you with a good feeling, a sense that if it had to end, this was as good as any.  There is a wonderful symmetry.  The first episode of Season One had Max, Isabel, and Michael deciding that they had to leave Roswell because others now knew their secret.  They stayed and when they did finally have to leave in Season Three, they left with Liz, Maria, and Kyle as well, quite the self-made family.",1144281600,9,5496,4.480402010050251
2306131,3,B0009NZ2RY,"I am not saying it is bad or good, just different. There is less Sci-Fi and more of a ""Dawson's Creek"" aspect than the first 2 seasons.

The 3rd season jumps into a storyline so different from the season 2 cliffhanger. Liz and Max are criminals..Isabel is already dating a man for a couple months when her boyfriend has just died..Then it continues from that point on.

I am not a sci-fi fan, but I do miss the excitement the first 2 seasons had with many episodes that left me on the edge of my seat. I didn't get that feeling from this season.",1141689600,,545,4.230769230769231
2306142,5,B0009NZ2RY,This was a great ending even though I was hoping that this show would go longer than three seasons.  I would have to say that I wasn't too fond of the last episode though.  If you are into Roswell this is a definite must see.,1141344000,,225,3.977777777777778
2306143,3,B0009NZ2RY,"Having enjoyed the first two seasons of Roswell, I wanted to enjoy the third season. I did up to a point, but objectively the series fell apart in the third year, and was brought to a merciful end after 18 episodes. This makes the season three set a poor value in both quantity and quality -- four shows short of a normal season of television, and deficient in imagination, continuity, and overall execution.

I believe the young actors in this series improved throughout their tenure in Roswell, but this is against the backdrop of declining script quality. The writing ignored logic at so many points, that anyone not in the grip of blind fannish adoration for this series would be quite annoyed.

To top it off, Jonathan Frakes produces some of the most inane audio commentary for a TV episode I've ever heard. Announcing the characters and actors as they come on the screen -- like we don't know who the stars of the show are???

What led to the demise of Roswell is probably the lack of a good story arc for the third season. For the first half of the year, Max was looking for his son, taken from him in season two by the duplicitous Tess (played by Emilie de Ravin, currently appearing in LOST on ABC). Then, Max loses interest in that quest. Isabel inexplicably abandons all caution and common sense, marrying a man she has known but a few short months. Inevitably this leads to conflict, since she decides to deceive him about her alien heritage. When her ex-lover from the home planet shows up on their honeymoon, more silliness ensues. Michael and Maria are together, then they split up, then they get back together, kind of, and finally Maria decides to commit. Colin Hanks comes back as a ghost (sort of) in one episode -- which seemed like an act of desperation to me.

Certainly there are enjoyable moments, and fans of the first two seasons will want to see the third. But keep your expectations low. Probably one of the best shows of the year, the one that is truest to the characters, is the episode about what the gang did on New Year's Eve. Maria and ex-Sherriff Valenti get to show their musical talents in several shows, Valenti with his country rock band the Kit Shickers, and Maria with her guitar in an aborted attempt at a recording career. I actually enjoyed the musical bits. The band Ivy puts in a cameo appearance in the wedding party.

Season three was a year of crazy capers, confused lovers, badly choreographed fights and action scenes, and villians with about as much depth as cardboard cutouts. And don't forget a healthy dose of stupid, stupid writing. None of it really adds up to much, and in the end, a prophecy of doom leads the aliens and their human posse to abandon Roswell. The epilogue, which informs us via a voiceover that Romeo and Juliet eventually marry, is hardly fitting. We wanted to see the series mature and actually experience that wedding in a future episode. The first and last episodes of the season are reasonably good, but overall Roswell ended its TV run with a whimper, not an antimatter explosion.",1139184000,27,3062,4.611009174311927
2306144,4,B0009NZ2RY,"This show worked pretty well as both as romance and sci fi. It didn't do them both at the same time though.  Around half of each season focused on the romance and the second half on the sci fi.

The second season has the most sci fi adventure, with numerous interesting and sometimes shocking plot turns.  Everytime I thought I knew where this show was going I eneded up completely surprised.

The special thing about this show was the way in which I was drawn into the lives of the characters. I really cared about them and was sorry to see the series end.",1138924800,3,557,4.326923076923077
2306145,4,B0009NZ2RY,"Well, while the final season of Roswell was wonderfully done despite obvious budget cutbacks, I think the writers tried to do too much too fast.  I didn't come into Roswell until after it had been cancelled, but I think you can tell that the makers of the series knew that the 3rd season would be the last.  They tried to fit too much in -like a once grieving Isabelle suddenly falling in love/getting married - and ended up leaving a lot out - like where did the evil aliens go?  The government stepped up their antics, but the aliens that had been trying to kill the ""royal 4"" for so long seemed to take a back seat.  The ending, however, was fantastic.  And while I do have some problems with the final season, over-all, I'm glad I bought it, I'm keeping it, and I'll watch it again and again and again.",1138406400,2,806,4.311258278145695
2306146,4,B0009NZ2RY,I thought this was a good way to end the show especially on short notice. A lot of things did evolve so fast but was nice to see a different change in the show and the problems that arose for the characters. Too bad the show had to end. Really enjoyable and look foward to seeing the stars of Roswell in other shows. Hopefully they will have better luck in the lasting of their shows than this one.,1137196800,,398,4.115384615384615
2306147,4,B0009NZ2RY,"Roswell came onto the scene in 1999, following Dawson's Creek in the WB lineup. The first two seasons were broadcast on the WB before the rights to the third season were picked up by UPN, which aired the final 18 episodes in the 2001-2002 television season.

I never watched Roswell while it was on television, but after reading a good review about the first season, purchased the DVD set and was hooked on the story. Both the first and second season sets were quite good and I was certainly looking forward to the third and final season when it hit DVD stands earlier this year.

Roswell follows the lives of alien-human hybrids Max Evans (Jason Behr), Isabel Evans (Katherine Heigl) and Michael Guerin (Brendan Fehr) as they try to live their lives as normally as possible in the alien-crazed town of Roswell, New Mexico. Their secrets were safe until Max used his powers to save Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby), bringing Liz and her friend Maria (Majandra Delfino) into the secret.

Over the course of the first two seasons, Sheriff Jim Valenti (William Sadler), his son Kyle (Nick Wechsler) and Alex Whitman (Colin Hanks) found out about the aliens secret. Alex was killed at the end of season two by yet another alien-hybrid, Tess Harding (Emilie deRavin) who was carrying Max's son, the heir to the throne on their home planet. All of these aspects play a part in the start of the third season.

Liz and Max, torn apart in season two by Max's relationship with Tess, are back together and in the very first episode, they are trying desperately to find a way to find Max's son. Throughout the season, that is one of the big story lines, as Max searches for the son that is rightfully his. He knows that Tess left Earth to return to her home planet, and he wants to find a way back to save his son. As the season, and the series, draw to a close, Tess returns to Earth to bring Max his son, who is 100 percent human, and Max, knowing he can't raise a son, gives him up for adoption.

The story line between Max and Liz was the main motivation in season one and it again takes center stage in season three. Liz's father forbids the two from dating, even at one point, sending her off to boarding school in Vermont. These two actors share amazing chemistry and their relationship is an incredibly believable one straight to the final episode. You really get the sense that these two love each other. When Max is supposedly killed while rescuing Valenti from a fire (and the requisite bad guys), Liz, at boarding school in Vermont, has the sudden feeling that he is dead.

Michael and Maria have quite possibly the stormiest relationship in town. Their on again, off again, human-alien relationship is put to incredible tests. Michael struggles in school, takes on another job in addition to his work at the Crash Down Cafe, Liz's parents' restaurant. All of this is tough on the relationship between the two characters, but again, as the series winds down, the viewer begins to realize just how much they mean to each other. Maria, on another note, gets her dream chance to be a singer, but the realities of the ""Music Industry"" send her back to Roswell.

Isabel, we find out as the season opens, is in a relationship with Jesse Ramirez (Adam Rodriquez), a lawyer in her father's firm, who is eight years older than she is. She struggles with the truth about herself and her feelings for Jesse and how the two should intertwine. A visit from beyond from Alex helps convince her that Jesse is indeed the one she should be with. The two get married, but it is only after Isabel is shot that Jesse finds out the secret about his wife, her brother and their friend. This storyline is Isabel's strongest story line of the three seasons, by far. She showed her acting chops (which can now be seen on the ABC hit Grey's Anatomy) in fine form.

Valenti and his son Kyle, as possessors of the alien secret, are always in on the goings on of the aliens, but in this season, their parts were not as great as in the first two. They both have major parts in a couple of episodes, particularly as the season drew to a close. but ultimately, the two characters were not as central to the show as they could have been. Valenti's career as a singer (he was fired as sheriff in season two) is an interesting turn of events, however.

The final episode was very well done and everyone involved should be commended for wrapping up the series in a solid way, a way that brought closure to everything. The three aliens, Liz, Maria and Kyle, all pack up after a near sniper attack at graduation, where Max saved his friends and MIchael, in turn, saved Max, and leave town. Valenti, back in a uniform as a deputy (You've got to start somewhere), helps them get out of town and we hear, like we did in the very first episode, a journal entry from Liz, as she descibes how her life is now that she's left Roswell. We see her and Max's wedding and we see her father, reading the journal, finding out just all that had happened in the last three years of his daughter's life, as the van with the six friends leaves the church where Max and Liz tied the knot, and rides off into the sunset.

As far as extras go, this set isn't bad. There are four commentary tracks, including a great one from Creator Jason Katims on the finale. The only bad thing about these tracks, is each of them features only one person, which can be a little boring, but for the most part, they are informative.

There is a featurette on the making of season three and all that went into the final chapter of Roswell, as well as a short feature on Shiri Appleby's DVD tour in Japan, where we see the actress promoting the first season on DVD in Japan.

All in all, this was a solid set. The series wrapped up in solid fashion, leaving no terribly loose ends. Anyone who tuned in from the beginning certainly should have been happy with the way things turned out. It was a fitting end.",1133222400,51,5926,4.466728280961183
2306148,5,B0009NZ2RY,"So I love Roswell and have seen all the episodes twice- you know how they say third time is a charm?

I am watching season three again last night and it dawns on me- Isabel's wedding- I have been there- everything looks so familiar. Little brain cells start chugging away and the connection is made--- no I was not abducted by aliens or taken over by them to attend a wedding .....my good friend's sister was married there in the 1990s! The reception hall is shot only showing the distinctive french windows from one angle so I did not at first realize this was the same place---- location for brides interested in their own wedding?

The Calamigos Ranch nestled in the Santa Monica mountains out of Malibu. The wedding I went to was filled with drama too- bride's brother showed up with his floozy and wearing a big cowboy hat and was chased away by his dad.....and this was one where nobody caught the boquet or even reached for it:) Common new thing at weddings.....

Anyways- just wanted to share some trivia - if you want to get married in the LA area this is a beautiful , intimate location- thus why Isabel wanted it so much!",1132531200,2,1132,4.458937198067633

2306150,5,B0009NZ2RY,"And I'm sure most other fans are with me on this one. The final piece of the Roswell puzzle is now available on DVD, and let me tell you I couldn't be happier. While Season 3 wasn't exactly the greatest season the show had to offer (that honor would have to go to season 1) it does offer great episodes and a final close to the Roswell story. I waited long to get my hands on this, and I can tell you I'm just as pleased with this one as I was with any of the other DVD sets, and I'm sure that most other fans will fall in love with this one the same way they fell in love with both of the previous releases.

Season 3 starts off with Max and Liz trying to find a way for Max to get back to his home planet of Antar in order to save his son. If you recall the last episode from season 2 left us with Tess returning home carrying Max's child, but leaving Max, Isabelle and Micheal still on earth. So Max and Liz look into many things and try many ideas, even landing them in Jail at one point, which eventually prompts their parents to once again insist they not see eachother. Season 3, while the shortest of the three (only 18 episodes) does contain a lot of important moments: Tess's eventual return with Max's child, Jesse realizing that Isabelle is an ""alien"", Max and Isabelle being discovered by the FBI, Tess's Death, and Max's eventual decision to let his son Zan be adopted. There's a lot of great moments here. The season does take some occasional breaks, like the episode ""I Married An Alien"" (a spoof of bewitched), which offers some entertainment on the side, but doesn't further the story. The series eventually comes to an end with the episode ""Graduation"", which sees the gang ultimately leaving Roswell together, and Max and Liz getting married. While many questions were still left unanswered, it does give an appropriate end to a great series which I was glad see (keep hoping for that Roswell Movie).

If you love Roswell, then buy this DVD set immediately. Just like the other two, I guarantee no complaints. If you own either of the other two sets, you know what to expect from the extras, so I want go into it. They're pretty standard, but the episodes are what we really care about. This season is just as memorable as any of the others, and a great final chapter to a great television series that never really got that much attention. I still believe Roswell will always have it's cult following. So now we can all rest easy, because our collections are finally complete! Pick this up right away.",1127952000,,2521,4.384615384615385

2306171,3,B0009NZ2RY,"Some people love it but for me 3rd season was the poorest of the three seasons Roswell managed to get on the air. The show could have been so much better with only a little effort and so could this DVD set.
Region 2 got it back in October 2004, we had to wait until August 2005- you'd think that might mean a better set of extra's but it didn't. For yor money you get 4 commentaries (I checked and I think season 2 with 20 episodes only had 2)a short ""Class of 2002"" featurette (a few behind the scenes bits in it but not many)and a video of Shiri Appleby on a Roswell promo tour in Japan back in July of 2004, no other extras of any sort. Like the first two seasons this one has been converted to widescreen format and has ""new cutting edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team""- basically that means if it wasn't specifically mentioned by name in an episode you probably won't find it here.
As for the storylines, I never understood the whole Max in California trip bit although I didn't mind some parts. The saucer bit was especially dumb, the other protector (hinted at in ""Summer of '47"", 2nd season), has shirked his duty and is a top movie producer- you do- briefly, get to see his true form. ""Busted"" was the best episode of that segment. I didn't mind the addition of someone obviously Hispanic to the cast but the whole Isabel/Jesse plotline was weird (why couldn't Isabel have found a college student instead of a lawyer at her father's lawfirm?). The best parts of that line were in ""I married an Alien"", dumb plot but at least we learn something about Jesse. ""Chant down Babylon"" is the episode where Jesse learns the truth about his wife, it might be one of the best episodes this season, if you don't mind the whole Max/ Clayton body thing.
I'd read, I think, that towards the last the network let the writers go their own way. I think that the later episodes (I admit most episodes had good bits) were generally better and more like the earlier seasons, except for seeming to drop the whole mission of returning to fight for Antar. #16 Crash involves an Air Force fighter colliding with a UFO then the gang protecting the pilot and his daughter from Air Force hitmen (I didn't get why the USAF kills pilots who have such incidents). The worst part is Jason Behr really should've gotten a haircut and a shave in posing as an airman- no way he'd have gotten on base looking so shaggy. #17 Four Aliens and a baby- It was Tess piloting that UFO, come back to Earth because Kivar has reneged on the deal she had to return to Antar with Max's son (baby Zan is full human, no Antarian DNA) she kind of patches things up with the gang (it's never explained why she always seems so much more powerful that the others)before returning to the airbase to destroy her ship, herself, and most of the base to get the Air Force off the other's trail. The biggest flaw in this one is that even though Max, Michael and Tess are unable to get out of Roswell with baby Zan- Tess and Liz are able to drive out to the base and Liz drive back without trouble from Air Force checkpoints. The way the Evan's parents so quickly adapted after their strange suspicion of their chidren was weak too. #18 Graduation was a sort of sad end to the series. An Air Force General has  reunited members of the Special Unit (that Nasedo disbanded) hunting down the aliens who destroyed his base. Thanks to visions Liz has the gang is able to foil their plot to kill them during graduation ceremonies. I had some problems with inconsistencies here as these ""professionals"" didn't appear to notice that Michael wasn't in the room, also- notice the lighting after Max darkens the place- it varies between full dark to just dim light with the hitmen's riflescopes either seeing nothing or seeing in green nightvision. I'd also say it would be unlikely that the school would permit a student, as Max did, taking over the speech.
The best touch was having Shiri Appleby ""Liz"" do the voiceover for the end of the episode/series. She started the series and she was there at the end.

I immediatly read them, and have been hooked ever since. I was thrilled to discover that they had a t.v. show and bought the first season the very next day. I loved it! I'm sorry to see this show go. However, this was still a season and final farewell. BUY IT!!!!!!!",1124928000,2,413,4.111111111111111
2306184,3,B0009NZ2RY,"Our entire family got hooked on Roswell after the first season came out on DVD.  Then we waited (quite impatiently!) for season 2 and watched the entire 2nd season in 4 days.  Needless to say, we were HOOKED and incredibly excited about season 3.  The day Amazon took pre-orders we had ours in and finally watched them all this last month.  WE WERE SO DISAPPOINTED!  Maybe because the show switched networks, or maybe because it knew it was ending, but for whatever reason the 3rd season leaves so much unanswered and brings up a lot of questions in the process.  Season 3 doesn't really pull you in or start getting ""exciting"" until the third of the five disks, and that is a big disappointment--especially seeing how all of season 2 just moved right along and drew you in.  If you are a fan, then you'll probably get Season 3 to see for yourself, but it just might be better to love season's 1 and 2 and pretend the show just goes on forever...",1124841600,3,946,4.433526011560693
2306185,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Roswell is without a doubt one of the most amazing shows I have watched on DVD this year. It does have teen drama, but it isn't as annoying as that found on The O.C. or Dawson's Creek. The show is about outsiders (both alien and human) who are just trying to find their way in a very confusing world.

While the sci-fi aspect of the show may seem odd to WB fans, I found it quite refreshing. It brought a whole new dimension of importance to the characters' actions. It made the show not a teeny bop drama, but one that dealt with larger, adult issues.

The third installment of the series is amazing and enthralling. So suspensful, in fact, that my husband and I watched the whole third season in a weekend.

This show is very real to me. Unlike other shows I love such as Alias and 24, Roswell has characters with real emotions dealing with the pain of being different and finding their place in a world far away from home.

My only complaint with the third season is that the final episode left my husband and I with many questions. My only hope is that there is some kind of follow up to the series in addition to the hard-to-find and over priced post-series novelizations.",1124582400,4,1177,4.360730593607306
2306186,4,B0009NZ2RY,"The third season of ""Roswell"" ended up being ""The Final Chapter,"" but it clearly was intended to be a transitional period for the show and its characters.  Because of that, even though the season ends with four of the characters graduating from high school, I ended up feeling more like too many things were left hanging than arriving at an actual sense of completion (specifically, what I take to be a U-turn regarding the character of ""Jesse"" at the end).  This is hardly the fault of the show's producers and there may well be an accumulated undercurrent of anger and disgust at termination of shows like ""Roswell,"" ""Dark Angel,"" ""Firefly,"" and ""Angel"" that die too young.  Then again, would ""Roswell"" really work if it was no longer set in Roswell?  I say, ""yes,"" but that is an argument for another day.

If the first season of ""Roswell"" was about truly star-crossed romances and the second season focused more on science fiction, then the final season tries to find a happy balance between the two.  Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) want to be together but events in the season's first episode, ""Busted,"" give her father (John Doe) ample reason to keep the two apart.  Meanwhile, in what becomes a major sub-plot, Max and Isabel's father (Garrett M. Brown) starts doing more than asking questions about what his kids are up to (""Interruptus"").  But while Mr. Evans has his eye on Max, he is missing the fact that Isabel (Katherine Heigl) is having a romance with Jesse (Adam Rodriguez), a young lawyer in his firm (""Secrets and Lies"").  As for Michael (Brendan Fehr) and Maria (Majandra Delfino), they actually seem to notice that the peculiar cycle of their relationship is not necessarily a good thing (""Behind the Music"").  But the couple exhibiting the most friction during this season is clearly Kyle (Nick Wechsler) and Jim (William Sadler), with the latter a fish out of water now that he no longer wears a badge.

The relationship between Max and Liz is still the heart and soul of ""Roswell,"" and for the most part it is solid this season except for the brief boarding school bit (""Panacea""), which comes across as an unnecessary diversion.  Since I really liked Isabel and Alex (Colin Hanks), so I could never warm up to Jesse, and having Alex ""visit"" Isabel only reinforced that idea (""Significant Others"").  Taking the inevitability of Michael and Maria for granted does not making their going round and round on the same points of conflict over and over again any easier to take, especially since while Michael actually takes steps towards growing up (""Michael, The Guys and The Great Snapple Caper""), Maria is prevented from doing so (""Ch-Ch-Changes""), so it ends up a wash, which hardly seems fair.  Besides, there are other ways of pursuing a music career besides singing with a giant heartless label (""Panacea"").  This leaves little for the Valentis to do besides father and son comedy bits, with a few notable exceptions (""Chant Down Babylon"").

Perhaps the biggest problem with this final season is how the kids are trying to figure out their love lives while so many people are after them.  In addition to Max and Isabel's parents there are the evil aliens (""Interruptus""), a pharmaceutical company (""Panacea""), the F.B.I. (""Who Died and Made You King?""), the U.S. Air Force (""Crash""), and sometimes most of the above (""Four Aliens and A Baby"").  When we get to the final episode and Michael suggests the time has come to get out of Dodge, you have to just go ""Duh!""  But then these pursuits often stop conveniently so that the Roswell aliens are not captured, or in some cases are apparently forgotten.  I understand that the government cannot be too smart or too competent, otherwise the series ends rather abruptly with Max, Isabel and Michael on vivisection tables or floating in giant tanks of fluid, but it gets to be bit much when the government has military troops run through a house chasing an alien and they do not bother to at least detain people for questioning.  I thought the best of the bunch was the investigation by Max and Isabel's parents, but even that one was affected by the rush to wrap things up at the end of the season.

No one the comedy of ""Roswell"" tends to stand out as providing high points for the season.  This means not only an episode like ""I Married an Alien,"" which manages to tell a storyline both in ""reality"" and as a takeoff on a ""Bewitched"" type 1960s television situation comedy, but also the cute little moments.  The latter would include Max reading the role of an alien for a part on ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" (""Secrets and Lies""), Max and Michael breathing helium from balloons so they can play tin-foil covered aliens (""Crash""), and the moment in the finale when Liz turns to Maria and expresses disbelief that her best friend is made at her because she is not going to die like the rest of them.  Yes, I feel like that sometimes too.  Besides, it is not all fear and laughter on ""Roswell,"" as the show comes up with another moving Christmas episode (""Samuel Rising"").

Granted, I would probably think more highly of the three-season run of ""Roswell"" if I were actually of an age more inclined to identify with the young, good looking protagonists.  Certainly their bonds of friendship are central to when ""Roswell"" is working at its best, but as was the case with ""The X-Files"" there is only so much dancing around the truth that you can do before things start to fall apart, or at least become problematic.  Fortunately, this series benefited from having the relationship between Max and Liz at its core.  That is where it began and it is also where the series most fittingly ends.  Now my question is whether anybody has been writing novels continuing where things were left off with this gang, because those could be pretty interesting.",1124496000,3,5820,4.755467196819086
2306187,5,B0009NZ2RY,I was so happy when the third season came out on DVD. I was always a fan of the show when it was on tv. I think that anyone who watches the show can relate to the characters. To me the show isn't just about some aliens. It's about the characters and the things they go through during the show. I wish that the show never ended. I'm so happy that the DVDs came out because now the show never has to end. Watching the DVD makes me feel like I have never seen it before. Each time I watch an episode of Roswell I get so into the story again that I forget that I already know what is going to happen and all the emotions from when I first saw it come back. Roswell is my #1 all time favorite show. All 3 seasons are great. I love all the episodes. There isn't a thing that I would want to change in the show. I think the producer and writers did a fantasic job with it. I love and hate the last episode of the show. I think it is a great episode but I hate the fact that it is the very last episode. I recommend that everyone go out and buy the complete Roswell series. It is worth it %100.,1123804800,9,1086,3.8526785714285716
2306188,5,B0009NZ2RY,"The critically acclaimed cult TV series built on the relationships between humans and aliens gets its send off with the release of its last season on DVD, after a rather bumpy ride through the archives of lost shows. The Final Chapter (Season 3) broadcast on UPN about three of four teenage aliens struggling to find their identity and purpose on earth brings Max Evans, Isabel Evans, Michael Guerin and determined Tess Harding to the questions we've all been seeking - what will become of the ""Royal four?"" Will they return to their home planet and save their race? And can Max and Liz ever be together? Its graduation year as the alien trio with their loyal human friends come of age in a period of uncertainty as the truth about who they are and their alien powers can no longer be hidden from the FBI.
The season takes off from S2 cliffhanger, Tess is gone leaving Liz & Max searching to find his son. What differentiates this season from the rest is each of the characters are now moving in different directions, representative of the end of high school and times gone by. The Crash Down caf&eacute;, focal point for the pilot & subsequent seasons where our friends would meet & hang out is much of a distant memory. As the Air Force and FBI close in, it becomes inevitable that its not only the aliens who are in danger, their human friends will also have to pay the price for keeping their secret. No one is safe anymore and home seems lost forever. Fans of the show are divided when it comes to Season 3 following its production by UPN. Where as WBs Season 1 blended a mix of high school anguish, romance & sci-fi action, Season 2 took the plot lines further focusing more on the sci-fi element. With the switch to UPN, Season 3 dwells even further into the whole conspiracy, still maintaining the romantic thread through. But much of the camaraderie of the earlier seasons is now gone, also serving as a reflection of life in itself - we all grow up and start to follow our own dreams and deal with our own issues. While some story lines might not have had the time to fully play out, S3 will always be a favorite for fans of this cult show, which in its 3 years run blended beautifully life's most simple human elements with the supernatural.
While the magnificent folks at RoswellMovie.net are working hard to convince executives to make a feature film based on the series, this is the one fans have been waiting for, loaded with all 18 Episodes From The Final Season, commentaries and bonus featurettes.  Like the prior seasons, the release will feature new cutting-edge songs selected by the original Roswell music team - Those of you complaining about it take heart! The show would never have made it to DVD if this had not been done - while the original music of Roswell helped define the show, its a small price to pay to have the entire series available on DVD & in all fairness, the producers have managed to do justice with the new soundtracks. So sit back & enjoy the show presented in 1.78:1 widescreen with English Dolby 5.1.!",1123804800,8,3048,4.531760435571688

I'm really sad this series is now over - it truly was one of the best sci-fi series on television.  All the actors/characters were awesome.  The storylines and the ""love story"" of Max (Jason Behr) and Liz (Shiri Appleby) is really what drew me to this series.  It's too bad that the DVD for Season 3 didn't have more ""special features"" and commentary from the actors.  I was hoping they would also include the extended season finale for the ""Graduation"" episode that was talked about by the producers, but had to be cut into one hour due to the network.

I'm looking forward to seeing more of Jason Behr in future projects.",1123632000,5,735,4.447761194029851

I disagree because I feel Season 3 goes back to how Season One was written involving Max and Liz's romance and also the funny episodes.  This set is very entertaining and also concludes very well.  Many people did not like the finale but I thought it was pretty good.  Do you really believe any Roswell fan would have been happy with any ending?  Still wishing for a movie though!,1123545600,6,464,4.411764705882353
2306191,4,B0009NZ2RY,I love the show. Very sad that they cancelled it and jeust left us all hanging liek that. The final episode really sucked the way it ended with everyone just jumping in a van and taking off. Didnt like the way that finally when Jesse and Isabel's parents find out the truth they get left behind. Other than the ending the show was great! I really wish the creator of the show would make season 4 where we see the trouble the group gets into and where their lives have led them. Some TV station should give Roswell another chance! All these reality shows suck big time but they still show them but yet a good show gets cancelled.,1122508800,,628,4.285714285714286
2306202,2,B0009NZ2RY,"Although seasons 1 and 2 were very good, season 3 felt rushed and incomplete. The story lines were disjointed and made no sense. Where did Jessie all of a sudden appear from, why couldn't they just do flash backs or something to explain how Jessie and Isabel met, and why did they have to get married so fast. It is well known that the actors wanted the series to end and along with the competition from Smallsville maybe it was time but the writers could have done a better job.

The finale sucked, basically the aliens forget thier real mothers plea to come back and save thier planet. No instead they choose to forget who they are and bum around earth playing superheroes. I think thier plan was to travel around in a beat up van and help ppl that needed helping....stupid. What about in season two when Max from the future comes back and tells Liz about the war?  is that just obsolete now. Also what happens to Michael and Maria do they ever really get together? and why did they have to leave Jessie behind? no the finale felt incomplete and rushed just like the entire 3rd season did.

2306203,4,B0009NZ2RY,"I absolutely love Roswell. I first was introduced to it at the end of Season 2 when a friend of mine told me to quit being a Buffy/Angel/Charmed only fan and take a look at this series.  So I checked it out and fell in love with it, only to have it be cancelled the following season.

Ever since it ended, I've been waiting for the series to come out on DVD. Finally...at last...it has happened, the series is complete. I can even forgive the producers and directors for taking out the original music except in key areas.  I know they had a tough decision on rather to keep it and pay more licensing fees and not be able to release the series on DVD, or to use new artists except in extremely key points of the series and be able to finally release it to the fans.

My only issue is this...Season 3...partial season...and yet we are asked to pay the same price...literally... as Season 1 and Season 2.  Why?

Buffy the Vampire Slayer's First Season was a partial season due to not knowing if they were going to be picked up, then being thrown in half way through a season as a replacement.  And if you purchase that first season, which I have, it's half the cost as Season 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  Anyone have a reason why this is?

If I wasn't such an avid fan, I wouldn't purchase Roswell's Season 3 at all. As it is I'm going to wait a bit till the price drops as a result.",1121990400,2,1374,4.135338345864661

Once you watch a few episodes they become like family to you.

  I do hate to hear negative feedback from other people about this show.  I guess I am just a Roswell junkie.  I love them all.  I just can't bring myself to criticize it.  No matter how much better I thought it could have been, I still enjoy every episode.  Hope you all enjoy, as I have, through all three seasons.",1119312000,3,710,4.295454545454546
2306206,1,B0009NZ2RY,"I was a big fan of Roswell's first two seasons.  It was a great dramatic show that had found a nice mix of romance, comedy, drama, and action, all rolled into a great group of characters as they struggle with an otherwordly secret.  I didn't like everything they did, especially in Season 2, but the overall charm of the show never died.  Until Season 3.

I found Season 3 to lack the substance and quality of the first two years of the show.  They changed the show too much, and the changes are mostly not for the better.  Here are some reasons why Season 3 doesn't measure up:

1) Its a good thing for characters to change over the course of a series, but change for the sake of change is not always good.  For example: While the growing maturity of Michael's character (while still maintaining some of his rebellious tendencies) in Season 3 was a great change and wonderfully handled.  On the contrary, the growing immaturity of Valenti was not a great change.  He went from villain in Season 1 to trusted friend and ally of the alien group in Season 2, but he always brought something of a mature presence to the teenage series.  He's the adult's perspective on the secret, you could say.  While the changes in Season 3 sort of fits what happened to Valenti in Season 2, can we really fit the image of rocker boy Valenti dating younger girls in Season 3 with the authority figure he was even after he lost his job in Season 2? Not really.  At the same time, some characters didn't change at all.  Kyle, for instance.  He is still the comic relief Buddha boy who can't get laid.  They could have really done some

better things with him, and only waited to the end of the season to add to his character.

2) The way the writers handled many of the characters' development and relationships in Season 3 really stunk.  Case in point-Isabel.  When we leave off at the end of Season 2, she is mourning Alex's death and dancing with his ghost at his grave.  Then, boom-Season 3 begins with her kissing and making out with some character we were just introduced to.  Big mistake.  It totally disregards the fact that Isabel has just lost her first true love, killed by a girl she considered a friend no less.  Also, we don't even know who this new guy Jesse is as a character and she is already all over him.  It makes her look like a cold, self-absorbed girl who is horny and wants a hot, money making husband. Now, if they had shown how their relationship developed, and given more distance between her post-Alex mourning period and her hook up with Jesse, then it might have been a great development for her character.  But it was handled poorly, and bringing Alex's ghost back a few episodes into the season to tell Isabel its okay to marry Jesse only slightly repaired some of the damage.  Plus, it sends a bad message to young women.  Get married right out of high school when your 18 to an older guy when you are just starting college?  Uh, not what I would recommend.

3) One of the best things about Roswell was the group dynamic between the friends.  That is mostly lost in this season.  There isn't really a group.  They are just a bunch of individuals who only seem to see one or two of the others at times.  Also, there is a real lack of feeling this season that these teenagers are....well, teenagers.  That was part of Roswell's appeal was the fact that these are young people who are trying to deal with problems that would confound most adults.  Did we even see them in school more than once or twice this season?

4) Most of the plots in Season 3 were absolutely moronic.  An old guy who runs a drug company wants to drain Max's life energy?  Max goes to hollywood?  Max and Michael impersonate Air Force personnel to get onto a base to rescue a pilot who the Air Force wants to kill?  Liz has powers now?  Khivar can beam his mind billions of light years and take over human bodies?  Absolutely dumb!  And I'm not going to even talk about the Bewitched parody!

Now, there were a couple of good episodes this season, such as Tess' return and the episodes surrounding Jesse's discovery of Isabel's alien origins.  The finale is good, too.  The only good overall plot thread they did was Max's father finally investigating his son's strange behavior. Other than that, this season is pretty much a wash. I bought the first two DVD sets, but I am skipping this one.",1118707200,25,4377,4.4341279799247175
2306207,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I never saw Roswell on TV. I am a fan of soft-core sci-fi (Quantum Leap, Smallville, Lost etc) who, after reading some reviews, took a gamble on Season 1 due to a great discount sale by Amazon.com. Subsequently, I bought Season 2, and unable to wait unit August, I bought the Region 2 version of Season 3 from Amazon's UK site.

The episodes in Season 3 range from great continuing storylines (Busted, Secrets and Lies, Control, Crash, 4 Aliens and a Baby, Graduation), great stand alone episodes (Samuel Rising, A Tale of Two Parties), a novel but almost silly episode (I Married an Alien) and an unbelievable hard-core sci-fi episode (Chant Down Babylon). As with most series the best episodes are written by the creator, in this case Jason Katims.

Compared to Smallville (the other `alien with special powers in high school series') Roswell is more mature in every way - mainly the relationships and the humor (some of Micheal's lines are classic).

Luckily, for the most part, Season 3 steered away from the follies of Season 2. Namely, the obviously `trying-to-be -Buffy' story arcs that featured the woeful `Skins' and the cringe worthy `Dupes'.  Although, Season 3 still has its faults: it suffers from leaps in continuity (particularly Liz's dad's attitude to Max) and events range from a bit forced (the return of Kivar) to totally implausible (the whole Max is dust, then an old man is in his body, then he is back alive thing).

But there are a lot of great events crammed into this shorter-than-normal season. But as a consequence it does feels very rushed - obviously because the writers had to wrap up the series early. In his audio commentary on ""Graduation' Jason Katims gives an accurate appraisal of the series strengths (Max & Liz's chemistry, the Nasedo storyline from Season 1) and weaknesses (no consistent enemy, characters with not much to do).

It's a shame it only lasted 3 seasons, but it was probably its natural life span considering the characters graduated and having them all stay in Roswell would feel contrived, like every other long running teen show has. But maybe the intended fourth season storyline - having them all travel around in a van helping people via Liz's visions whilst running from the FBI would have breathed new life into the series. The final episode is appropriate, most things get resolved, but again a bit too quickly. Now all the gang need is a dog named Scooby!

It is unlikely a future TV movie will re-unite us with these characters again (Katims even jokes about it at the end of his commentary!) but surely the profits from the DVD sales alone would justify it? Regardless, I expect to see a lot more from these actors in the future, particularly Jason Behr (rightly labeled `The Next Tom Cruise') and Shiri Appleby (surely the heir to Meg Ryan's rom-com sweetheart throne).

2306210,5,B0009NZ2RY,"We live in a pretty cool time. We can ""own"" films and TV shows, watch them over and over at home with big screen sets and kickin' sound and don't need to be rich to do it.

So when Roswell Season One was first released, I was pretty happy. As season Three finds its way to our hands, the cycle is complete.

I had a chance to meet and interview Brendan Fehr and he was a little surprised to find a middle-aged guy (me) who liked the series so much. I am and remain an unabashed groupie for Roswell.

I've always liked different stuff - Twin Peaks remains my favorite TV series - but I came to the first Roswell episode not expecting much. I was quickly hooked and I'm a bit puzzled by anyone who might wonder why. It might not be for every taste but it's hard to deny the quality of the work.

The series was impeccably shot. Sound, editing, music - it was all top notch. The first season's claustrophobic setting (the small city of Roswell) lent itself well to the story and allowed the characters to establish bonds before moving the series into a wider arena.

At the core of the series was (IMO) one of the all-time great love stories: Max and Liz. The chemistry was simply breathtaking and I can't recall a show with two more attractive young leads who seemed truly be attracted to each other. And when the bond starts by Max saving Liz's life, it's strong from the start. More than once I was swept with emotion, watching the scenes play out. Yes, there are some lame parts of all three seasons. Yes, there needs to be a suspension of disbelief in order to buy into the show. And as far as going on to more seasons, I think the show was working within a built-in box that had nowhere to really go. Like Lost and 24, it got harder and harder to keep the momentum and twists building.

Still - it was excellent. I've missed it over the years and am so grateful for the DVDs. Roswell was a perfect combination of movie/TV genres: teen love, thriller, science fiction, comedy, cliff-hanger ...

I wish all the actors well and hope they remain as connected with each other as fans of the show are connected to them.",1117670400,42,2116,4.314861460957179
2306211,5,B0009NZ2RY,"I find it funny that the only negative review of this seems to be more about the books than the actual tv series.  What does the book series have to do with the DVD release of the tv show that is the one that's actually being reviewed here?

Absolutely nothing.

I suppose the fact that the tv show was cancelled means it failed.  Just like every other tv show that has ever been cancelled, because THAT is a sign of failure.  Yes.  Indeed.

See, by those standards, all shows are, or will be failures.  It certainly is an interesting way to view the world of tv.

A more accurate statement would be that Roswell failed to succeed enough for a 4th season.  The fact of the matter is, most of the actors were growing weary of the show, and Smallville, a direct competitor was taking many of the viewers for that slot.  I suppose in the long run, Smallville was a worthy successor, seeing as it is enjoying more popularity than Roswell could have hoped for.

I'd take Roswell over Smallville any day of the week.  Simply put, I find it to be a much better written show, with better actors, and a much better story line.  Even now, in hindsight, seeing all of its flaws, I find Roswell to be one of the most addicting shows I have ever seen.  Perhaps if it had been done a little later on, in the midst of The OC, with a different time slot, Roswell could have gone on longer.  I'd even say, I'd want it to.

That's not to say the show isn't as close to perfect as could possibly be, already.  90% of you will love this show, watch it, it's well worth it.

One more thing, I am well reminded of ""Family Guy"" which was cancelled.  Definitely didn't fail.",1117584000,9,1650,4.2612903225806456
8063838,5,B0009NZ2RY,"Bought this series as a gift for dear friend/movie buff in hills out of Fairbanks, where you cannot stream Hulu.  Best tv series, ever, and close to my old heart, as a believer.  Jason Katims is pure genius.  Actors are amazingly talented.  It's shot beautifully, and edited perfectly.  Direction is the best!  Everything about it is great.  Omg, Jason Behr is the most beautiful human ever created, yes?!  And a brilliantly innate actor.  I'm amazed at the skill he shows so young!  Having lived on Western slope of Colorado in the 70s, and having experienced the whole ufo thing myself; this wonderful series is very dear to me.",1519171200,,630,4.75
8063839,3,B0009NZ2RY,"This is not a show review but a review of video and audio quality. The version presented here and on other digital platforms has been resized such that information on the top and bottom of the screen image has been cropped off. The DVD versions offer the original version, in full, of each season, except for unfortunate song replacements throughout each season. The digital versions are not sourced from the masters and may have been taken from the television masters (not the celluloid masters/film masters) which would explain why they resized to fill the screen and emulate a full 16:9 presentation when what they started with was 4:3 presentation.

I hate to say it but they should have stuck with the 4:3 ratio, as it would have looked significantly better, having not been magnified so much but also having retained so much of the sets we are losing in the cropped version. The sound is the same as on the other digital presentations, including the Netflix digital version, a little muffled and oddly changeable, with peaks and troughs in volume, as though someone fiddled with the controls when they were transferring the show. This is not Amazon's fault as there is only one digital version of Roswell. It is likely the best digital presentation we will get and is worth it to play in the background, if that is your purpose.

With that being said, if you are looking to sit and watch, and I meant sit and watch intently while doing nothing else, then you should seek out the DVD releases of this wonderful show as the quality is significantly better and the DVDs do upscale well, as compared to the digital version which is clearly in SD and never comes close to looking like the faux-720p upscale most upscaled DVDs give us on our 1080p televisions. That upscaling illusion really does make all the difference with low resolution content and the digital presented here just doesn't do that well on upconversion. The DVDs look pretty much the same on our 1080p television as on our old 720p and both are leagues ahead of the old 480p we keep in a tiny office and never use. Still, we bought the series on digital and enjoy playing it in the background and I'm sure some of you will as well, if the picture quality is not as important to you and if the volume variability doesn't bother you. I hope this helps you to make your choice about which form of this wonderful show you prefer.",1515542400,2,2394,4.617370892018779
