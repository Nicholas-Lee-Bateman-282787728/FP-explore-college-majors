8157804,5,B00066NA3M,"I sincerely miss Sensei Chinen and his amazing manner of instruction and performance of our moves in Goju-Ryu. He will always be missed. I had been debating on purchasing this set for some time, but now I am very happy I have it. A full compilation of his teachings across every aspect. Kata, Bunkai, Kihon, Grappling, Kumite - even 108 questions about Goju. Chinen began my love for Goju, and I am determined to continue it by ensuring I remember his manner of instruction and passing it on to my own students. Thank you, Sensei.",1443571200,3,530,4.589473684210526

8157806,5,B00066NA3M,"Teruo Chinen is a living treasure. I have had the opportunity to train with him at several seminars and special events over the years and the congruency between his spirit and his art is complete. As a child, Chinen Sensei started his formal training under Chojun Miyagi, founder of Goju-Ryu Karate-do, and he represents a generation whose first-hand knowledge of Okinawan martial practice as understood by the founders of their Ryu is disappearing. These videos contain what he felt must not be lost. Any martial artist, regardless of style, would be well served by the lifetime of practical knowledge contained in these seven volumes.",1363564800,,636,5.125
