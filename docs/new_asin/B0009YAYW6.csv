8070349,4,B0009YAYW6,"When I first started watching this DVD I noticed that the picture was not changing and my thought was ""You've got to be kidding me?"" So I fast forwarded through a lot of the scenes hoping to get to a place where it was more entertaining. Then after it was done I went back and selected just one scene that I liked and figured out I could listen to ambient and nature sounds with a scene/chapter. That made it much more enjoyable than just the ambient/electronica music. I then figured out I could listen to the ambient and nature sounds on the whole thing. That I must admit made quite a difference. So when you start this go to the ""audio options"" and select ambient + natural.

So what you basically get on this DVD is six scenes all about 10 minutes long. The music sounds like a synthesizer from the 80s and the music is relaxing. When there is mist or rain in the scene it is easier to watch for a longer period of time. Scene/Chapter 4 is of a forest when it is raining. There are a few birds flying about but mostly it is just rain and I thought it would set a romantic mood for a married couple if they had a big TV in their bedroom. The deal is you can loop the videos so it plays for as long as you like. So you can select just one chapter and loop it.

So if you are thinking of sitting and just watching this for an hour it might not make you very happy if you expect the scenes to change more than six times. But if you want to create a mood of a forest in the background while you are doing other things, then this might be quite the good experience.

8070350,5,B0009YAYW6,"The whole point of this DVD is to provide a video window or a moving painting. In each scene the camera is fixed, looking up into trees and captures almost direct sunlight shining through the overstory. The camera is in ""soft focus"" which with the light and high contrast creates a semi-abstract image.

There are six scenes: ""Forest Floor"", ""Broadleaf"", ""La Isla Arlia"", ""Dibble"", ""Understory"", and ""Edge Effect"". The names don't particularly match the images; the most I can make of them is that they're alternating dark green and light green, and the trees seem to be in temperate forests in early summer or late spring. Each scene is about 10 minutes long. Single scenes can be chosen as a loop, or the whole DVD can be run through once. In both modes you can choose either, neither, or both of 2 sound-tracks: natural sounds or music (""ambient""). The natural sounds might have been recorded with the scene, or might be an especially well-chosen mix of recordings from elsewhere; I can't tell. I never listen to the music.

I'm pretty sure the aspect ratio on the package label is outright false: all the images off the DVD look to be 169 = 1.778; I'm fairly confident that they are not 2.35 (~73). But I'm actually happier with 1.778 than with the bars and/or distortion that comes with 2.35.",1291593600,,1297,4.684210526315789
8070351,5,B0009YAYW6,"Perhaps the two previous reviewers were looking for something else than what I found in this gem of a DVD. I live in a very urban environment and Parks seem controlled,manicured and articial. How is Nature really like? This DVD shows us that if we take the time to look, Take a ""mini-vacation"" put this on play and under ""audio options"" choose ""natural""or, if you prefer, choose ""silence"" under audio options and put soothing music. (I choose to listen to John Dowlands Lutes works -- which is available nere or make a playlist with your favorite piano music by Phil Coulter-- which is also available at amazon and then,go about doing your daily chores around the house and occasionally stop and contemplate on Her beauty. It  is healing .You can also get video goggles,  and watch it using them for a totally immersive experience.

8070352,2,B0009YAYW6,"There are six scenes. In each a stationary camera captures Sun's rays penetrating the forest. Footage for each scene is less then a minute long but is repeated about fifteen times or so. Theme music can be considered meditative.

This DVD will likely not appeal to nature lovers. It gets two stars for possible use as a meditation tool.",1145318400,6,336,4.694915254237288
8070353,1,B0009YAYW6,"In each of the few scenes, the camera never moves at all, so you just, for example, watch sunlight in real-time pass by a great tree for 10 minutes, then for the next 10, watch rain fall on tall grass field, all with a still camera which never ever pan around or zoom out or move in any way.
