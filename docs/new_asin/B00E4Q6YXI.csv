8601056,5,B00E4Q6YXI,"This is a re-release of a 2002 Opus Atre release of David McVicar's ""gritty and Sexy"" staging of this perennial favorite. I reviewed it here in June of 2002 and wrote this:

""Oh those naughty Brits! Who would have ever thought that nudity would be part of a Verdi opera? Well, it isin the first scene of Act Iand it is for this reason that I caution prospective buyers. But if you know the story of the libertine Duke of Mantua (originally, the tenor part was supposed to be King Francis I of France, but the censors said ""no!"" to that), you will understand that the nudity and behavior of the Duke's court was that of a totally corrupt ruler. And although I was unprepared to see naked people in one of my favorite operas, it is, vocally, visually and sonically the very best opera performance I have yet experienced on DVD. All of the singers are simply superb! Soprano Christine Schaefer is perfect in the role of Gilda; she is visually ideal as a young woman, and her vocal skills and interpretation are first rate. Marcello Alvarez, one of the two top tenors of today (the other is Ramon Vargas)is vocally stupendous as the Duke, yet from the outset you will hate the character while loving Alvarez' vocal interpretation. This Duke is a spoiled, arrogant, womanizing wretch! Paolo Gavanelli sings the title role brilliantly. His is a demanding part that requires substantial acting and vocal skills, and aside from an occasional excessive vibrato on sustained mid-voice notes, Gavanelli is simply great. Edward Downes conducts with both sensitivity and authority. The digital picture is first rate, but in this performance, the Dolby 5.1 sound has to be heard to be believed. It gives a stunning depth and richness to the music; yet one is able to differentiate between instruments and localize soloists on stage. So if you tend to the traditional, you may find the nudity and sexuality to be too much. But if you wish to experience a vocally stunning and dramatically effective performance, you will not find better opera on DVD. But you may want to alert the neighbors, because this is one disc that will demand a boostin the volume control.""

Well, that was 13 years ago, gentle reader, and much has changed since then (for one, I no longer write run-on paragraphs). This is still an exceptional performance, and the new price is hard to beat, but for my money, the best Rigoletto on disc is the recently released performance on C Major with Machaidze and Nucci. That's the new standard!",1380758400,7,2495,4.733333333333333
