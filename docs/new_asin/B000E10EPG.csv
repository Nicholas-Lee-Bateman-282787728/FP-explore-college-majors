8560984,5,B000E10EPG,"Finally a climbing movie with actual climbing. The DJ Revolution soundtrack is sick and got me psyched! This video and Dusatko's others set the standard for what climbing media can be. No lame interviews or slow elevator music, just sendage and psych.",1275177600,,251,5.0
8560985,5,B000E10EPG,"A bouldering video with just bouldering! No lame interviews or slack-lining, just classic boulder problems.  Chris Lindner's FA of Belly Flop V12/13 in Black Mountain is the heart of the video for sure. DJ Revolution brings a perfect energy with his original soundtrack - the separate CD (included) is on repeat in my car!!

Soul Cal gets me motivated to boulder every time I watch it.",1198972800,,385,4.818181818181818
8560986,2,B000E10EPG,"This is the second climbing video directed by Paul Dusatko that I've seen, and I have to say that I'm not impressed.  It's the kind of effort that will be treasured by those in the obviously tight-knit community that produced it, but with less appeal for others.  I must preface the following comment by saying that I am not a huge fan of hip-hop, but have heard some that I liked.  The hip-hop soundtrack made me want to put the dvd on fast forward and watch the climbing without sound, which I did.  The climbing is pretty good, with certain stand-out segments (i.e. Chris Lindner's amazing persistance in establishing a certain first ascent), good camera work and lighting.  But the pounding monotony of the soundtrack and the occasional sophomoric camera work and lame sexual inuendo detract from the good points.

The extras contain some of the best and worst of the DVD - best is footage of climbers, especially Natasha Barnes the sole female member of the group, climbing great stuff with no music in the background.  Best, also, is some of the relaxed goofiness that comes across in the quiet moments.  Worst is the posturing and (real or faked?) smearing of feces on the top holds of a route.
Lame.  Come on, guys, grow up.",1186704000,2,1232,4.666666666666667
