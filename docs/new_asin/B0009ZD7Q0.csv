8070728,5,B0009ZD7Q0,Because I had the first Charles Vine Movie I wanted a complete set even though I knew it was not as good as the first movies. I was very pleased with the speed in which I received it and frankly I was pleased that I had no trouble playing it through my vcr considering how old the movie is and that it is vhs.,1393891200,,309,3.84375
8070729,2,B0009ZD7Q0,"Directed by John Gilling and released in 1966 ""Where the Bullets Fly"" is a poor spoof of James Bond that tries to cash on the Bond craze.

The plot from IMDB says it's about a "" secret agent is assigned to get the formula for a process that can drain nuclear energy from an element called spurium.""

In actually it's a rather boring and unfunny spoof where the Agent doesn't do anything until the second hour to regain the serum.

The jokes in the movie from a guy saying ""he's all blown"" (just before he gets blown up) and Tom Adams (the Agent) complaining about his feet being run over just don't cut it.

The movie also without a huge budget as a spoof itself really don't have anything worthwhile to keep the viewer interested.

There are no real high tech gadgets here, there is a pretty decent shootout in a morgue and some fistfights with Adams as Chales Levine but that's about it. One of the few brights spots though is that the acting is actually good.

The movie got a 4.2 rating from IMDB which is really mediocre so if you're still willing to seek out this movie I would recommend renting it first.",1153612800,3,1111,4.368932038834951
