8722199,2,B010EB1KRG,"As this a Blu Ray, I expected there to be actual video content, especially for the price. Now, while it gives the users a way to download the music to a PC, the only other content it has is a static slideshow to watch while the music plays. It's fine, but what passes as minor bonus content on another blu ray, is what's billed as the main content. Extremely dissapointing. If it were $15, maybe get it as a slightly better way to purchase the music. But for a Blu Ray, I was expecting at least some video content; but there is actually zero.

The music of Final Symphony is the mountain top of video game music taken to the next level. buy that; don't buy this blu ray.",1470182400,3,670,4.1937984496124034
