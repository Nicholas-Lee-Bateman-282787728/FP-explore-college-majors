8562967,5,B00B5N3E5O,"**NOTE** For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has combined the reviews for Seasons 2 and 3 of ALICE so I was not able to post a Season 3 review on the proper product page. Hopefully it will get some views here.

The third season of ALICE consists of 24 episodes that aired Sunday nights on CBS during the 1978-79 TV season. Halfway through the season ALICE was moved to the prestigious 9:00 Sunday time slot and became the CBS anchor for the night, a position it would hold until the fall of 1982.

TV veteran William Asher (""I Love Lucy"", ""Bewitched"") directs most of these installments and it's here that that show starts cooking on all four burners. Some of the earlier episodes had a static feel to them--not so with this bunch. There's a terrific two-parter where Mel sells the diner to a snooty restaurateur (Hans Conried) and the series walks the fine line between comedy and pathos in the terrific season-finale ""Flo Finds Her Father"" (played by F-TROOP's Forrest Tucker). That episode as well as the one that precedes it on this set (""My Fair Vera"") boasts exceptional video quality. In fact, I noticed an improvement on most of these episodes over those on Warner Archive's Season 1 and 2 sets.

The writing just seems sharper at this point in the series, and surprisingly, even though the episodes themselves are self-contained, there is a continuity that was unheard of on sitcoms at this time. ""Alice's Decision"", ""If The Shoe Fits"" and ""My Fair Vera"" all make mention of Alice auditioning for the same talent scout and Vera appearing in a children's theatre production of Cinderella.

If you have been on the fence about springing for any of these M-O-D ALICE sets so far, make this the one to get--you won't be disappointed.

FIVE STARS and bring on Season 4 and FLO: THE COMPLETE SERIES.",1366588800,,1803,4.711111111111111
