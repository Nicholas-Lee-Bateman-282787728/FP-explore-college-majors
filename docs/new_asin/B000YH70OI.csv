It had music, friendships and adventure all wrapped into one package.

8232775,4,B000YH70OI,"Denver the Last Dinosaur is one of those old-time cartoons that remains a fun ride for all ages. Despite the fact that the show is dated back to the late eighties and some of the jokes may not register with today's generation of children, it can be used as an object lesson to teach the fundamentals of good behavior and doing what is right, while still having fun. This is highly recommended for all parents and their children.",1201824000,3,428,4.5

I was overwhelemd with joy when I first saw that this was on DVD. It has been one of my most wanted TV shows to arrive on DVD and I found it. Denver the Last Dinosaur first premiered in 1988. It is a children's show filled with warmth, friendship and adventure. It's about a group of young teens in Los Angeles who stumble upon a dinosaur egg which hatches revealing a dinosaur whom they name Denver. Togethor, they have fun adventures, such as skateboarding down the streets of L.A. going to restaurants, messing around and playing music. They even go to prehistoric time by the use of the enchanted eggshells from Denver's egg. At the same time, the kids must also defend Denver from money-hungry scientists.

If you're a fan of classical cartoons from the 80s and 90s, I would recommend this title to you. You, you're kids and your family will certainly enjoy Denver the Last Dinosaur. This is a great show for children for it's one of the few animated shows that contain no violence.
Children will love Denver the Last Dinosaur and parents would love it for their kids for its non-violent adventures.

I remember Denver the Last Dinosaur from my childhood and I was so happy to feel like a kid again.",1201651200,5,1270,4.565789473684211
