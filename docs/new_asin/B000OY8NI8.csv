2801710,5,B000OY8NI8,"I have been wanting this DVD for a loooong time but I just hadn't gotten around to it. I'm glad I waited because now I have both seasons 1 and 2 for nearly the price of 1 season alone! I was a bit leery of ordering it since there was no photo available but since it shipped straight from amazon, I figured it was safe. Both DVDs arrived together in the normal packaging. The DVDs are great. I have already seen each episode! This has everything from Sheneneh's date with Kid (from Kid n play) to Martin's crazy trip to LA and his proposal to GIna. This was definitely a good buy for me.",1265241600,24,586,4.149122807017544
2801711,5,B000OY8NI8,"I rate Martin close to Sanford and Son. No matter how many times you see it, it's still funny. I collect DVD for my rocking chair days. This is a series I can see myself watching in my latter years of life.",1264377600,,206,3.9285714285714284
2801712,5,B000OY8NI8,"I have all three seasons and plan on buying every season when they are available on DVD. This item is not only a must have but its genuinely one of the funniest show EVER to come on TV. Martin provides natural comedy and his humor is unparallel to any of this modern day era. Furthermore, the dvds come unrated from HBO so you get the REAL episodes. Trust me you will NOT be mad.",1197504000,,379,4.135135135135135
2801713,5,B000OY8NI8,"Oh my goodness, Martin is so funny. I own both seasons 1 & 2 of this series and I can't wait until the third season comes out on dvd. The characters that Martin brings to life on the show are hysterical and they show what a comedic genius he is. There is no other show like it on television and I don't think there will be for a very long time. It's original and outrageous, with great characters that play perfectly off of one another. No one will be able to watch any episode without laughing, so just sit back and enjoy.",1190073600,4,523,4.137254901960785
2801714,5,B000OY8NI8,"I have been LMAO since I started watching the shows.  It brought back so many memories from 1992, it took me back to the place where I was during that time period.  Wow what good times they were.",1188518400,2,195,4.105263157894737
2801715,3,B000OY8NI8,"The product is no doubt pretty good. However, due to the way it was sent, I had to pay to the federal government 60% more beyond the shipping and the value of the product, which made it more expensive in the USA than in any local store here in Brazil. It should have been sent by Sedex not by the way it was.

That was not the first time I bought a product in the USA through the web. But, this was the first time it cost me too much.

If the DVDs and CDs are authorized to be sold to this country, so, it means that the taxes are already implied on the shipping.

I hope you may somehow compensate this prejudice.",1184198400,,614,3.975609756097561

2802112,4,B000OY8NI8,"This is the first of my favorite shows purchased on DVD.  The Martin Complete Season 1 & 2 DVD's are definitely money well spent.  I loved this show back in the day and was saddened to see it end.  Rather than watching it on tv and reruns and commercials, it is great to just pop these in.  These make for great viewing over a rainy weekend and intend to do the same with the other seasons I ordered.  To all of the Martin fans out there, this is a must buy.",1344124800,,458,3.989010989010989

I watched every single episode when it was originally on the air, I watch the reruns on tv now, and pop the DVD in every now and then and still can't get enough. These are classics and my only unhappiness comes from the fact that it took so long for this show to come on DVD.",1343606400,,368,3.9864864864864864

Martin Lawrence is an outstanding comedian, as well as, the others actors:  Tisha Campbell, Tichina Arnold, Thomas Mikal Ford, Carl Anthony Payne, II, Garrett Morris and Jonathan Gries.  They are spectacular in their own right but very, very good in this series and I would love to see them come back with another installment of ""Martin,"" maybe from another city, other than Detroit.
