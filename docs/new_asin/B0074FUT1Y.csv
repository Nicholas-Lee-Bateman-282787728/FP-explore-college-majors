5054086,1,B0074FUT1Y,"I didn't buy this, but I have seen both. It's a horror movie bundle. The two worst book to movie translations in the world. So many skipped scenes in Eragon, and the plot to Percy Jackson is completely screwed up! I mean, where did all this ' find the pearls ' nonsense come from?!?!?! These are in my top ten book series, and they're in my top ten worst movies ever list.",1408752000,2,372,4.180555555555555

5054091,4,B0074FUT1Y,"I found both well-produced and imaginative, certainly diverting.  Based on very popular novels, that devotees will probably not see as adequate for representing their favored stories.  I came without any expectations and so was not disappointed in the fantasy get-away.  Nothing deep here, but with clever plotting.  For two movies, a decent price.  I'm not sorry to have had the experience.",1390089600,,391,5.344262295081967
