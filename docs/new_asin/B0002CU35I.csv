special--something more than a $5 fast-food burger.  With this

DVD, for your $90 you get 50 minutes of video, much of which is

about the ancient hstory of bullfighting, scenes of ganaderos

making notes about the quality of calves, etc, and about 10-15

minutes of a corrida meat-and-bones (to continue the hamburger

analogy) with a very skimpy couple of minutes on the final

tercio--the work with the muleta, which nowadays is the heart

of the fight.  If you want to learn a little bit about the

bullfight and don't mind spending the $90, then this dvd is OK.

1) If this DVD cost $15, say, I'd give it 4 stars--reasonable

value for the money.

2) For $90, just like a $50 hamburger, you should get something

special:  a book on the basics of bullfighting, such as Marvin's

Bullfight or Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon (a bit dated

but still excellent)--both available from Amazon, or Fulton's

Bullfighting (used copies through Amazon), plus about 5 hours

of video.  Footage of some of the past figuras, footage of the

different major styles--Ronda, Seville, Tremendismo, etc,

Footage of the cape and muleta passes, showing good and bad

examples.  Footage of adornos.  Examples of how tremendous

emotion can be generated, and footage of cowardly torear.

Footage of how to distinguish a good bull from a bad one,

footage of what makes a good kill, what makes a bad kill.

Overall--about 2 1/2 hours to show what to look for in a fight.

Then a complete--start-to-finish--decent corrida at a good

ring to see how the previous footage applies. A corrida takes

2-3 hours.  Such a package would be a good buy for your $90.

3) Or--buy Marvin or Hemingway, read the book, and then buy

a bullfight DVD of a corrida.  There are half a dozen places

in North America you can get such DVDs--including ebay

(e.g. lasaves & dalbo9) and torosfilms.com (mostly Mexican

fights).  Most of these DVDs are in Spanish, with some in

French and some documentaries in English:  prices run from $7

to $20 for a 2-3 hour corrida on DVD.  If you don't know

Spanish but have read one of the books, you'll still enjoy the

DVDs--the excitement of the crowd and the TV commentators will

come through very well.  Look for the corrida at the Plaza

Mexico Feb. 5th, 2005--that's one of the best in the last 10

years, or look for a corrida wil El Fandi--he usually puts on

a very dramatic show.  The DVD sellers on ebay, etc, will

list the bulls and matadors and usually the trophies awarded--

""dos orejas y rabo"" is ""2 ears and the tail"" indicating a very

good fight.",1144195200,38,2635,4.657894736842105
8026188,5,B0002CU35I,"I loved this show, it has actual bullfight footage andtons of information on everything from the history of bullfihting to some of the customs surronding it.  I highly reccomend it!",1115683200,2,181,5.033333333333333
8026189,4,B0002CU35I,"This DVD does a creditable job of explaining the sport/art of bullfighting. It examines man's fascination with bulls and with fighting them historically and then goes on to explain the actual events that take place before, during and after a corrida. We see how bulls are trained and selected and finally, how they are fought. Each of the stages of the contest is explained.

I make no moral judgements about bullfighting in this review and the DVD does very little to try to justify the practice. It is informative without being overly ""preachy"" in one direction or the other. I purchased it because I wanted to understand what was entailed in the practice and this production did an admirable job of explaining it.

Two things only kept this review from getting a 5th star. The quality of the production left a bit to be desired. There were occasional, small jumps in both the audio and video. These in no way rendered the product less useful, but do not expect a Hollywood style of production. The other factor that was a bit of a dissapointment was the brevity. The first program was 30 minutes and the second was just about 20. This imparted the basics of ""Bullfighting 101"" but did not go into any depth. It was an introductory treatment. In that capacity, it did a fine job.

If this video has a major failing, it is the price. In that respect, I must admit that it is not worth the price of admission unless you REALLY WANT a film on the subject. I probably would not have purchased it at this price. As it happens, I added it to my ""basket"" with lots of other stuff and did not notice the price until after I had already taken delivery. Then it was a shock. I am well satisfied by the product but it IS too pricey.",1113350400,17,1723,4.44620253164557
