2822362,5,B000PHX5MI,"I was originally looking to get the Airplane dvd, but to my surprise it also came along with Top Secret.  Both of these movies were great when they first came out, and even today they still are just as enjoyable.",1325203200,,212,4.3
2822363,5,B000PHX5MI,"Long ago---in the 1980's---I had both these movies separately on VHS. What a delight to re-own these two classic films together in one DVD package! ""Airplane"", the one that re-invented the ""cuckoo"" comedy, does for disaster flicks what ""Blazing Saddles"" did for movie westerns. The directing trio of the Zucker brothers & Jim Abrahams gleefully beat the genre to a pulp, with the sheer number of good jokes far outnumbering the groaners (thankfully!). The ""serious"" actors in the film---Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, and particularly, Leslie Nielsen---would never be looked at the same way again with this movie. It's the badge of a good film which gets quoted over & over again to this very day.
The trio returned in 1984 to do the sometimes-overlooked ""Top Secret!"", a flick with the giddy spirit of ""Airplane"". This time around, it targets WWII intrigue/Elvis Presley flicks (strange bedfellows, but it works) as an unlikely hero in heartthrob rocker Val Kilmer manages to save the day. There are outrageously funny moments that will stick in your head forever: Omar Sharif, another ""serious"" actor who's quite funny here, being compacted along with his car into a walking block of metal; the absurd ""Skeet Surfing"" opening credits musical number; and two guys dressed as a cow to access the power grid to shut off an electric fence...then a hungry calf comes along to extract milk...you can almost guess the punchline, which will have you on the floor! Like ""Airplane"", there are just too many funny moments crammed into the movie to recount.
Surely, two great comedies which are getting their due---and don't call me Shirley!",1308009600,8,1629,5.059479553903346
2822364,1,B000PHX5MI,I bought this because of the reviews. Many said it was a good family movie. I would never allow a child to view this filthy trash. I threw it away before anyone saw it in my house.,1295395200,,180,3.891891891891892
2822365,5,B000PHX5MI,"Airplane is the original but by the time they produced Top Secret, they were at there best!",1264896000,2,91,4.411764705882353
2822366,4,B000PHX5MI,"I loved both of these movies when I was a teenager. Now I am buying them both for my children. If you like good, dumb and stupid humor than this video is for you. Fun for the whole family! and laugh away while you can",1251590400,4,217,3.8444444444444446
2822367,4,B000PHX5MI,Totally love both of these movies and the price is great!!  Now my 17 year-old loves them too!,1231459200,3,94,4.222222222222222

2822369,5,B000PHX5MI,in my view this is what started it all. and yes i have seen the kentucky fried movie. which were also the zucker brothers film as well. if you can find that you will see where it all began. not to mention danny kaye as robin hood...funny,1392940800,,237,4.0638297872340425
2822370,5,B000PHX5MI,"Two classics in one package!  This was a gift to my husband, but honestly something we can enjoy together. Highly recommended, even if you rarely buy videos.",1383696000,,157,4.814814814814815
2822371,5,B000PHX5MI,"I have now bought 3 copies of ""Top Secret"" as people have borrowed copies.  Both have cheesy puns, sight gags and tons of quotable lines like ""Yes, I know a little German... he's over there (points to a little person in liederhosen).

Just buy it... you won't be disappointed.

(By the way, the third movie is ""The Naked Gun"")",1381190400,3,326,4.491525423728813
2822372,4,B000PHX5MI,"Airplane  has got to be one of the top  of Slapstick Movies. I don't usually like slapstick but I'll make an except with Airplane. Every time I watch it, I notice something different - there are so many verbal and non-verbal gags it hard to take them all in at once.

The second movie is not much more than a time-filler but, what the hey - this DVD was the lowest priced one I could find of Airplane.",1366156800,,401,4.115384615384615
2822373,4,B000PHX5MI,this was a very funny movie I would recommend it to everyone.  It arrived before it was due to arrive so that was also nice.,1364515200,,124,3.96
2822374,5,B000PHX5MI,"I already had a copy of Airplane II so I wanted to grab the original. From the price to the added feature of getting Top Secret! in a double feature, I could not pass it up. Great stuff...laughs all day long...yup, excellent option.",1363392000,,232,4.4186046511627906
2822375,5,B000PHX5MI,"Much like the ""Naked Gun"" trilogy, ""Airplane!"" and  ""Top Secret!"" are essential comedies that still make people laugh until they cry. A must for anyone who wants to relive the days of classic comedy",1362182400,,198,4.823529411764706
2822376,5,B000PHX5MI,Great price for two classics!  I love introducing my kids to classic comedies like these.  They don't make 'em like this anymore!,1358380800,,129,4.818181818181818

8191445,5,B000PHX5MI,"Two awesome movies.  I hadn't seen either of these films before but bought this dvd for my husband's Christmas stocking and wound up really enjoying both titles.  My favorite of the two was Airplane! but Top Secret's similarly amazing.  If you are younger and did not get into these movies when they were new(er), they are along the lines of the humor in films like Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and a cleverer version of modern parody flicks like ""Scary Movie"".  Better, though...definitely better!  These 2 films hold up really well!",1419811200,,539,4.752688172043011
