4595416,4,B0057GUHWI,"The four star rating is for the Double-Feature DVD. My ratings for the movies are a bit different.

Rob Zombie's ambitious retelling of the Carpenter classic and its sequel met with negative to mixed results (in the case of ""Halloween II"" it was definitely negative). In my opinion, he may have bit off more than he can chew. I admire his passion for the genre and both films have their merits (I am in a group of minorities that actually prefers Zombie's ""Halloween II"" over his original remake) but overall, both films are inferior to their respective originals.

Halloween (2007) ***

Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" is iconic and remains a classic. It is one of my favorite films of all time and I constantly re-watch it and I do mean constantly... because I love it. The film does not rely on excess, over-the-top violence and gore to get its point across. The gore is minimal yet it overflows with tension, fear, suspense and mystery which elevates this rather simple tale to great cinematic heights. Even Roger Ebert (RIP) compared it to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Furthermore, Carpenter didn't really explain much. He simply gave us some spine-tingling images starting off with a chilling scene of a boy brutally killing his sister on a sinister Halloween night and culminating with that image of an empty yard where moments prior, Michael Myers lay dead from a gunshot wound to the head and 5 to the chest. We are left with questions. Why did this little boy kill his sister? Why did he return to Haddonfield 15 years later? Why does he stalk a shy high school student and her obnoxious friends? Why does he want to kill her? But .....do we really need to know this? Not really. Carpenter didn't even attempt to let us in on the mind of Michael Myers. Let us make up our own minds on why this evil exists. This is where I think Zombie tried too hard. The entire first half of his film is dedicated in showing us why Michael Myers became Michael Myers. In vain, he tried to give a face-less, murderous monster a soul. In doing so, he stripped away the mystery, the mythology. Also, in telling his tale he squeezed in as many unpleasant stereotypes as possible. In Zombie's version, Michael (played by Daeg Faerch as a child) was a dysfunctional, un-kept, disturbed social misfit. His mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and didn't really have the means to emotionally support her dysfunctional offspring. Her abusive, drunk boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe), who is obviously a negative influence, lives with them as does Myer's egotistical, selfish, sex-crazed sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall) and let's not forget the school bully. Yuppers, I guess with so much wrong in this kids surroundings, it is understandable why he tortures small animals and is destined to become a mass murderer. In my opinion, it does not work; I do not think that there is enough time here to fully explain how a mentally sick child can turn into such an incredible, invincible mass killing machine. Zombie may have been successful in showing us how the young Myers could have become a Ted Bundy or a ""Jack the Ripper"" type killer... but never Michael Myers. Anyhow, due to neglect, emotional abuse, and mental problems, the young Myers snaps and commits some grisly murders on Halloween night. After a lengthy trial, he is found guilty of first degree murder and committed to the Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium where he is looked over by psychologist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and is visited frequently by his mother. It is within the walls of the Sanitarium that Myers begins another mental decent into madness. He becomes obsessed with making sinister papier-mch masks. Dr. Loomis and Deborah try in vain to reach through to him but the boy just zones out and become more withdrawn until he is just an empty shell and when least suspected, commits another bloody act that proved to all the boy is a murderous psychopath. The story then jumps ahead several years. Michael (now portrayed by Tyler Mane), still withdrawn, unkempt, and massive (the guy looks to be at least 7 feet tall) escapes while being transferred to a maximum security prison (note that this scene is entirely different in the Unrated Director's Cut) and returns to Haddonfield where he begins stalking the unsuspecting Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends. The rest of the film, despite some differences, is similar to the original film and follows the typical slasher formula; lots of grisly executions, nudity and lots and lots of screaming.

As already stated, I just could not believe the chubby, androgynous, awkward blonde kid from the first part of the film became the 7 foot, invincible, hulking monster of the second half; it was not believable to me. I do appreciate that Zombie tried to take the tale in another direction and I did not expect him to give us a total rehash of the original film. Had he done so, he would have been criticized for not being original. In a tale like ""Halloween"", less is more and Zombie simply put, gave us too much. The atmosphere is also lacking. The ominous dark tones of the original was shoved to the side to make room for some trashy, unlikeable, uninteresting characters and lots and lots of vulgarity. This does not mean the film has no merits. As a slasher film, it delivers and this version out-does the original in sheer brutality; this Michael remains a spectacular villain. His size overwhelms and his grisly executions leave us no doubt he has a bone to pick with humanity. There are also some unsettling images such as those scenes that show a voiceless, withdrawn child in a psychiatric ward wearing sinister papier mch masks. I just wished the rest of the film was this effective. Watch it for the gore, the spills, and for some of the performances (Malcolm McDowell, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingly effective here). Try not to compare it to the original; the magic that made that film so good is unfortunately missing here.

Halloween II (Theatrical) *** 1/2

When this film was released back in 2009, it was butchered (no pun intended) by the critics and most of the audience. I, personally, do not care because I actually like it and prefer it over Zombie's original re-visioning of ""Halloween"". This sequel is brutal; it is unsettling, ghastly and it moves at a pretty brisk pace. Admittedly, I prefer this version over the Director's cut which is not exactly scarier or bloodier; it is longer with revisions to timelines and characters making it an almost totally different film. For the horror nut, watch both versions and decide which one you like (or detest) more.

This grisly sequels opens with a brief flashback of a young Michael and his mother that introduces the ""White Horse"" theme- a reoccurring theme for the duration of the film. The film then cuts to a shocked and wounded Laurie Strode, who aimlessly walks through an empty street in Haddonfield, having survived a near fatal confrontation with Michael. She is taken to the hospital where the diabolical Michael follows and I guess you can guess what happens there. The rest of the film does not even remotely resemble 1981's ""Halloween II"". Zombie did not try to imitate it and despite a brief scene taking place in the hospital, the rest of the film goes to places the original did not. Laurie Strode, because of her past traumatic experiences, is clearly messed up, seeking the help of a therapist (played by an almost unrecognizable Lois Lane.. I mean, Margot Kidder) while Dr. Loomis, shamelessly tries to cash in on the tragedy of the Haddonfield massacre by writing a tell-all book which reveals the truth about Myers and his connection to Strode.

The tone of the film is much darker than Zombie's ""Halloween"" and the executions here are excruciatingly explicit, even in this rated version. Whatever built up anger Michael possessed is unleashed here; I mean, talk about overkill. The man really has a bone to pick with society. In some of the kill sequences, I honestly had to look away. The characters here are also very different than what we were used to seeing in the original film and its sequel. Here the characters are raw and emotionally, they are cut open; we see them in their entirety (This is where the unrated version offers a bit more substance). Strode is exposed as a disturbed, confrontational young woman and a far cry from the shy, good girl Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Taylor-Compton's Laurie is not as likeable but it is understandable why she is such a hot mess. Danielle Harris who plays her friend Annie, is a more vulnerable, likable character. Whenever she is on screen, we see the ravages of her previous encounter with Myers across her pretty face. She remains the most sympathetic character in this film. Brad Dourif who plays Sheriff Brackett is also great here and like Harris, is given a bit more depth. I am used to seeing Dourrif play outrageous psycho characters; here, he is far more human. The film is not without its flaws. Although I warmed up to the ""white horse"" theme, it may appear silly to some. Zombie does permeate the films' surroundings with his usual unappealing flair - lots of swearing, some pretty horrible dialogue, unsavory supporting and main characters etc but we need to remember this is not intended to be ""Citizen Kane"". It is a horror film, a slasher film and it succeeds.

""Halloween II"" (2009) is not for everyone. Those who are not a fan of Rob Zombie need to stay away. The squeamish or those with faint hearts, I recommend you watch something not as visceral like Disney's ""Pinocchio"". This fable is a dark one. It is sick, twisted, and brutal to the core. As I already stated, I prefer this over Zombie's original vision of the Halloween legend and I will forever remain unapologetic.

This Double Feature is recommended to horror film fans because it is affordable. The picture quality on both films is good as is the sound. As stated, there are no extras other than a language selection and to reiterate, these are both the theatrical versions. If you prefer the unrated Director's cut, then skip this (unless you are a completist) and purchase those instead. They are quite different, especially ""Halloween II"". The Director's cut is inferior to this version IMO but it contains several additional scenes, revisions to timelines and characters making it a different animal altogether. Watch both and see which one you prefer. Those versions also come with some interesting extras.

4595929,3,B0057GUHWI,"Single disc Blu-ray set of the Rob Zombie revamping of the Halloween franchise (theatrical versions).  If you don't want to spend a lot and you're curious to see shat Zombie did with these films, this is the way to go.  Seriously, it took me 10 years to actually even remotely want to see them and when I did, here is my reaction.

Halloween - We all know the story, right?  Michael Myers is serial killer kid turned unkillable spawn of Satan as he tries to wipe out a group of scantily-clad sex-starved teens in inventive ways (see Friday The 13th, Freddy, etc...)  What Carpenter left out in the original, especially Michael's motivation for killing, Rob Zombie tries to fill in the gaps with his own brand of magic.  Think Tarantino meets Jackass.  There tries to be a cleverness but all the white trash vulgarity just gets in the way.  Little Michael live with his stripper mom (Zombie's seriously untalented wife), his slutty older sister, his younger baby sister, and mommy's scumbag boyfriend.  He likes to torture small animals and walks around with a clown mask on as often as he can (also sporting a KISS Destroyer t-shirt).  It's pretty much a scene from Natural Born Killers with every bit of sleazy dialogue you can imagine thrown in for good measure.  Well... some kids pick on Michael at school and he ends up in the principal's office where we are introduced to Dr. Loomis (Malcom McDowall).  Seems they found a dead cat in Michael's locker and a bunch of animal torture pix and his stripper mom can't believe her sweet (and so obviously deranged son) could be responsible.  Next thing you know, Michael heads out from school and chases down one of the bullies that was picking on him and beats him to death with a tree branch.  Later on that evening, as mommy is shaking her goods at the local strip club, Michael dons his clown mask, then the actual Michael Myers mask that we all know and love, and kills mommy's douche boyfriend, his slutty sister's dirtbag boyfriend, and his slutty sister, too.  He then goes and sits on the steps of the house with his baby sister on his lap (still wearing his creepy clown costume) and waits for mommy to get home.  Trial.  Sanitarium.  Years go by.  Michael turns into a voiceless 7ft tall behemoth.  Michael breaks out.  The killing begins in earnest. Yada. Yada. Yada.  There were moments in this film where Zombie stepped away from himself and made good decisions.  Some great eerie scenes and settings.  But then the ham-handed script work and the bad acting and the resurrection of too many out-of-work actors from the 70's along with the overall white trashiness gets in the way.  He could have made this better than the original by telling a great story of the origins of one of movies most iconic baddies, but he chose not to.  Instead he employed his charmless wife (who, he apparently, though sadly, believes, is both gorgeous and skilled in dialogue) and turned it into an episode of Meth Dealers on Parade or some such nonsense.  I like Zombie as a musician (mostly, and in small doses since he tends to repeat himself fairly quickly) but as a director and screenwriter...hmmmmm.  Midway through the movie switches gears back to a slasher/sex romp and  is pretty straightforward right up to the end.  Very Halloween.  The soundtrack is very cool.  This movie could have been so much more but in the end he went dumb because he couldn't help it. His musical fanbase is what he wants his movie fanbase to be so he pandered to that.  Curse like a retarded truckdriver, be a douche, drink and spit and strip and have at least one scene involving a toilet.  Bingo.  Oh...and it turns out the teen he was trying to kill is actually his little sister secretly adopted after his stripper mother offs herself.  Shocking!!!.

Halloween II - At least with the first movie Rob Zombie was trying to enrich the story that the original movie left us with.  John Carpenter even gave Zombie his blessing and told him to make it his own.  He did and he didn't.  In the sequel, he did.  Completely.  And that isn't a good thing at all.  We begin, like all those years ago, a few minutes after the 1st movie has ended.  Our bloodied heroine is walking down the street in the pouring rain still clutching the gun she believes that has ended the monster's life.  Police and ambulances arrive, bodies are photographed and bagged. Wounds are tended.  The monster comes back from the dead and escapes the ambulance.  People die.  Nightmares ensue.  One year later Laurie has turned from squeaky clean miss innocent into a grungy, foul-mouthed urchin who sleeps with a giant poster of Charles Manson over her bed and the words IN CHARLEY WE TRUST spray-painted around it.  Nice.  Thank you Rob.  Charles Manson is so cool...right? She's living with her friend and her Sheriff Dad from the 1st movie and she's all kinds of screwed up in the head.  Meanwhile Dr. Loomis has become this traveling joke money-grubbing biographer on Michael Myers (Malcom McDowall hang your head because Donald Pleasance is rolling in his grave) and is basically the comedy relief.  He's even on a talk show with ""Weird"" Al Yankovic where he gets blasted by the host.  This movie plays out like Torture Porn meets a Rob Zombie music video.  The storyline is ludicrous.  He once again inserts his wife in dream sequences dressed in various bizarre getups with pale horses in tow for what reason?  I think even he is still pondering that one.  Michael is the roving mountain man/serial killer with a big giant Rob Zombieesque beard and a hood and he offs all sorts of white trash miscreants along the way in his search to reunite with his dead stripper mommy and his long lost sister.  Ultra violent, ultra gruesome, ultra pointless.  Twenty minutes in you will be shaking your head because this movie just actually made you dumber in the scheme of the world by watching it.  Where the 1st movie had glimpses of brilliance, this movie is a gorefest filled with bad jokes, bad acting, and a whole ensemble cast of sleazeballs.

In the end this is the cheaper way to view these two movies.  The 1st is worth a watch.  The sequel should be expunged from the earth.  Think Grindhouse on crank. No thanks.

Cost me a lot, but it was worth it since I'm getting both theatrical cuts of the films which are not available in the U.S.

Both films look damn spectacular. Retaining the filmic grain look and having great detail, the movies are a joy to look at. I'm surprised at how spectacular it looks. It doesn't seem as if it could get any better.

The sound is very satisfying. Though, I have no surround sound equipment yet to truly hear the surround effect, it works extremely well for me on my HDTV. Sounds like it should.

I prefer Zombie's theatrical cuts over the inferior ""unrated director's cuts"". I love that they put these two together as otherwise they are totally ignored. This is the only way to own and view the films (on Bluray) on this side of the world.

Especially with Halloween II, the unrated director's cut is a very different film with numerous alternate scenes. The ending alone is quite bad in the director's cut and totally skews the interpretation of the film to a more literal one which does not work at all. The theatrical ending totally makes the film and ends it perfectly, supporting the interpretation I will defend to death.

Halloween II (Theatrical Version) is a masterpiece. I believe the reason it gets a lot of negative reviews is that people take it too literally as they do many films of this kind (Example: Sucker Punch). This is a metaphorical dream-like film. It's Laurie Strode's psychotic traumatic nightmare. Things are not to be taken as reality, but perhaps a version of it through the perspective of Laurie Strode. Think about duality. Think about seeing what isn't there. Otherwise, if taken literally, it will come off as absolute trash (though it would still have wonderful characterization.)

The film is a character piece. Characters are fleshed out and feel real. I feel tremendous sympathy for them (all of which weren't this dimensional in the first film). I've never experienced a ""slasher"" film, let alone a ""slasher sequel"" that was this sophisticated (except for A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge which is another misunderstood metaphorical masterpiece that is actually quite similar to this film). It's an arthouse Halloween. It's a heartbreaking rollercoaster that explores the aftermath and trauma of a slasher victim survivor. I feel emotionally in tune with Laurie Strode throughout this psychotic breakdown (or therapy session as I like to call it.) I adore the family dynamic between Annie and her father taking Laurie in and supporting each other after barely surviving a trauma. I've heard many people say this: It contains the most sympathetic death in a ""slasher film"".

The theatrical cut of Zombie's Halloween II is an emotional dramatic catharsis about trauma. It's one of my absolute favorite cinema experiences ever and this Blu is the closest I'll ever get to recapturing it.

And I'll end this all with a ""blasphemous"" statement: I think I love the film more than Carpenter's perfect original masterpiece.",1426982400,5,3160,4.860594795539034
