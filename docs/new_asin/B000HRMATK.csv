2640277,5,B000HRMATK,"This special aired recently on Noggin and now it's available for all to own on DVD. The DVD comes with a bonus music feature.

This special finds Toot headed to Scotland to celebrate his Grandma's one-hundredth birthday. Puddle stays home and gets ready for Christmas with the cute little pig Opal, but Toot promises to be home for Christmas.

Once in Scotland, Toot gets a big dose of Scottish culture. He learns traditional Scottish songs, wears a kilt and participates in Scottish Christmas-caroling (though he only hums along.) When it comes time to go home, Toot is hampered by flight delays and such, and worries that he won't make it home. But he discovers new friends, helps out a timid elephant who's afraid of mice (""What can I say? It's genetic."") and celebrates even more international culture.

This special has cute animation, winning vocal and instrumental music and a nice plot. My only small nitpick was an excess of scene changes that seemed somewhat unnecessary. Otherwise, excellent special. Hopefully will become a classic.",1166227200,12,1044,5.023121387283237
2640278,5,B000HRMATK,I have a 2.5 year old and he loves watching the DVD along with reading the book.  Very well done and just a bonus that it was produced by National Geographic.  Great Christmas gift (if you can find it) along with the book.  Toot & Puddle also has a line of other books that are entertaining to kids and have fantastic illustrations for the grown-ups to appreciate.,1166054400,11,364,4.402985074626866
2640279,3,B000HRMATK,"My daughter likes to read toot & puddle books, but for some reason she wasn't into the movie.  Maybe next year.",1261958400,,111,4.285714285714286
2640280,5,B000HRMATK,"My 2 year old son loves this DVD, we watch it over and over again, I think nick jr should consider putting the entire series on dvd.",1255824000,,132,3.925925925925926
2640281,5,B000HRMATK,"I got the DVD for my daughter a month before Christmas and she absolutely loved it, may be a little too much- asking to see the ""piggies movie"" every day. It is a fun story with music and songs that kids really enjoy",1231286400,,216,4.046511627906977
2640282,5,B000HRMATK,"I watched this with my then 3-year-old son last Christmas.  I'm very picky about cartoons (find most of the new Disney stuff obnoxious and lean towards Japanese cartoons like My Neighbor Totoro), and this met all my criteria: beautiful, whimsical animation; likable characters; and a simple, not overly done plot.  We get to see some of the characters prepare for Christmas in Woodcock Pocket, while the rest are celebrating a family reunion in Scotland.  The message here is to find beauty and joy in friends, family, and the ""work"" of Christmas.  When I turn on the tv to watch a movie with my child, this is what I want to see.  I'm about to go out and buy it now so we can watch it this week before Christmas.",1229644800,,713,4.496124031007752
2640283,5,B000HRMATK,"We really, really loved this DVD. They did such a great job making the book come a live. We loved listing to the Scotish accents. It is such a cute and dear story of friend ship and family. The Toot and Puddle books are some of our very favorite books, glad they made a DVD of this one, hope they do more!",1200960000,,305,3.935483870967742
2640284,5,B000HRMATK,"I bought this dvd for my sister's kids, an eight year old, a six year old and a toddler.  They loved it and watched it about twelve times this Christmas season. I watched it with them and thought it was adorable.  Toot's and Puddle's voices weren't annoying or weird.  This is an issue with me if I am already familiar with a character in a book.  I have read the Toot and Puddle series with my nieces and nephew, we all thought they sounded and acted exactly as we imagined they would.",1199232000,7,486,4.25
2640285,5,B000HRMATK,"It's a nice video.  Very non-commital about Christmas.  It doesn't present a faith-based holiday of any type, nor the commercialized aspect of it.",1199059200,2,146,5.304347826086956
2640286,5,B000HRMATK,"Toot and Puddle, what cute characters.  We enjoy the books.  But when I saw this last year on dvd, well, we just had to get it.  I was hoping that it would be cozy and fun and it certainly is!  Our kids were glued to the tv.  The colors are bright and cheery, the story is so nice, and it just has a warm feeling to it.  You have to add this to your Christmas dvd collection!",1197158400,,375,3.8051948051948052
2640287,5,B000HRMATK,"This is just a wonderful Christmas movie - the pictures are beautiful and charming and so true to the Holly Hobbie books. There is nothing bad or mean or scary- no ugly images or snow monsters and I find that SUCH a pleasant relief from every movie out there these days for kids that has to have the gratuitous scary creature or mean child etc. It is a simple and wonderfully happy story about two wonderful friends and a perfect movie for the holidays. I also like that there is no mom or dad or any ""traditional family"" stuff so if your family is not traditional, it is great too! I will add 2 very small negatives- I was disappointed with Toot and Puddle's voices - clearly I am a mom who has seen too many child's movies because I recognize the boys voices from Bigfoot (a monster trucks show on Discovery Kids Channel) and I think the other may be from Jay Jay? Anyways, I am used to them now but at first, I really wasa disappointed because they sound so modern and are not at all quaint or cute in any way. The music is the same- too modern instead of catchy and happy and peppy. But, other than those 2 things, it is a fabulous movie. I hope hope hope they will make more of the Toot and Puddle movies!!!",1197072000,,1212,4.206008583690987
2640288,5,B000HRMATK,"Holly Hobbie's Toot and Puddle picture books are among the most charming books available.  Her captivating watercolors are so beautiful and evocative of the magic and romance of childhood that I'd love to frame her pictures and decorate my daughter's room in Toot and Puddle.  This movie has all of her charm, and quality animation you'd expect from Holly Hobbie and National Geographic.  The story is delightful for my 3 year old, and myself, which is a bonus since we enjoy watching movies together.  The themes are always friendship, loyalty, family, and they're not preachy or heavy-handed.  The Scotland aspect is nice as an introduction to another culture that's not so foreign as to be lost on a toddler/preschooler.

I sooo wish there were more of these movies available.  I'd buy every one.  I think this video, and perhaps one of her books would make an exceptional gift for the recipient AND the giver!",1174176000,2,913,4.883116883116883

8140974,5,B000HRMATK,When I saw this movie on TV I fell in live with it. The next Christmas I missed it on TV and was so upset. So after that I made up my mind and bought it so I would have it for all year long. :),1357344000,,193,3.217391304347826
8140975,5,B000HRMATK,"My 6.5-year-old has loved watching the Toot and Puddle cartoons on Nick,J.R. and she loved reading the stories when she was younger. When she spied this title at our local library, she asked if we could check it out. At first I wondered if it would be too 'young' for her, but after watching it with her this afternoon, I have to say this production can be enjoyed by children of varying ages, and I myself found it enchanting!

Though it's a holiday-themed movie, we both enjoyed watching it together. Best friends Toot and Puddle are the stars of the show, and the story revolves around Toot trying his best to get back home to Woodcock Pocket in time for Christmas. Toot has made a promise to Puddle and knows that he must do all he can to keep his promise. Luckily for Toot, luck is on his side, and there is some extra bit of help from another.

Aside from the movie, there are special features, i.e. a sing a-long, and also Toot's Trip to Scotland which is a sort of brief guided tour through various locations that Toot visits on his trip such as Edinburgh Castle, Old Stirling Bridge, Scottish Highlands, Loch Lomond, and The Trossachs.",1316563200,,1144,4.4951923076923075
