8468411,2,B005EKWY46,"First Off, I was able to get this DVD pack at Guitar Center for 9.97 (I still have the price sticker on the DVD) and that is the only reason I bought it.  Before I go into the review, make your life easier as a guitarist and learn the notes on the fretboard and learn music theory.  If you know enough of both you'll see so much on the DVD can be presented in an easier way that you would be able to easier retain.

I'm an intermediate player; I've been playing off and on for the last three years.  From that perspective I would write this is a beginner DVD guiding you to intermediate level of play.  I found myself skipping the first third of the material--up until Arpeggios--because it is material I already know and the presentation of the DVD was much less than I know and not presented in a way that is logical.  It's more of, ""see how I do it and don't ask why just remember it for some reason,"" approach.  All the first part on Warm-Up Exercises and Scales makes more sense in terms of 1) notes 2) and shapes or their relation on the fretboard.  It's not presented that way here, like the linear player that he is it is presented in linear notes on the page.

The rest of the DVD starting with disk 2 has valuable and applicable advice so there is value to this DVD which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  Also, there about three or four nice exercises that deal with Applications that are interesting to play.  Other than that, if you are an intermediate player who knows the notes on the fretboard, scale shapes, and the basics of techniques there is not much for you on this DVD.

Another annoying thing about this DVD is that it is not in Standard tuning, which to me negates all of his scale exercises and arpeggio exercises because it's not in standard.  So, if you want to know how to specifically play in this one particular odd ball tuning then you will be happy (the tuning is something called A440, the fact that it has numbers in it tell you something weird is going on.)  If you otherwise play in Standard or in Standard with some adjustments then it's really hard to see how this what this guy is doing is going to apply in a universal setting (again, why you need to know the notes on the fretboard and music theory so that you can adjust what he is doing into standard)",1445126400,2,2305,4.244851258581236

8468413,5,B005EKWY46,"There are many guitar instructional DVD's available these days. This program is well-organized, thorough, and contains very useful and practical information. Rob starts with discussing how to hold your pick, then goes into different picking and legato warmups. Then it's on to scales and string skipping skill-building. Pentatonic scales are covered followed by a great section on arpeggios. Octaves are covered, and then a very cool section on chords where you are encouraged to get really creative with chords. The end consists of melodies and songwriting, which is great because so many instructionals only cover technique and give no mention of songwriting at all. I also want to mention that Rob Balducci seems like a good guy who really loves music and is enthusiastic about it. He has small but useful tips on confidence and a neat tip on picking that I have never heard of. I have tried it and it really seems to work. All in all, this is a very good guitar instructional program.",1404518400,3,988,4.922155688622754
