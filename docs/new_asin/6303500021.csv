674061,5,6303500021,"In an industry of magickal girl anime, Sohryuden is an enchanting tale of four brothers who run a school. Hajime, Tzuku, Owaru, and Amaru (Translation: First, Middle, Last, Too Many) The brothers have an ancient family secret. Unfortunately, they are the last to find this out.

When the Japanese underground tries to kidnap them for their own purposes, the powers of the Dragon Kings are released.
An exploration of Chinese Dragon Myth, elemental magicks, and the dark underground of organized crime in the Japanese culture.
Sadly, a series that was too short for its excellent content.",1075593600,,783,5.173228346456693
674062,5,6303500021,"I buy anything that has to do with this founding rapper of the West Coast sound. The DVD/CD is great for anyone that owns any Eazy-E album. My only complaint is the documentary was a little short. But the never before seen footage, clips of music videos, and more was well worth it. My favorite song ""Hittin Switchz"" sounds like it was just recorded yesterday. If only a radio version was available Eazy-E would be back on the charts. You can for one afternoon have an Eazy-E day. It left me wanting more, and I hope Ruthless Records has a couple more hidden gems. Defintely worth the money.",1031702400,2,591,4.481481481481482
674063,5,6303500021,"man this dvd is off the heasey, it has ten tight eazy e videos, some lost footage, clips of music videos from ruthless artists like bone thugs, kokane and mc ren, the only thing they could of improved was the length of the documentary but it was still tight, if ya'll don't buy this dvd then ya'll gonna miss out on this, oh yeah tight pc game called hittin switchez is on there and its kinda challenging so its fun too, aight i'm out peace 1,",1018569600,2,443,4.162790697674419

674066,5,6303500021,"I think the Tenchi in Tokyo series are the best series ever made because when Ayeka and Ryoko find out about Sakuay loves Tenchi and them (thinking she is a sneak trying to steal Tenchi)it makes them fight over to get Tenchi. If Sakuay breaks up with Tench,Ryoko and Ayeka will have a battle with each other which spice some things up in the series. But this video is not the best one.  The Tenchi Universe and Tenchi Muyo of Time Travel and Space Adventures is the best video out of all other Tenchi movies because it has more action.",1009670400,,535,4.35
674067,4,6303500021,"This movie was excellent indeed, but the movies and episodes I have seen from the OVA series and Tenchi Universe were much more humorous and had a deeper plot than Tenchi in Tokyo.  I do enjoy the Tenchi in Tokyo series but it lacks the humor of Tenchi Universe.  If I were to buy a series in order I would start with the Tenchi OVA series or the Tenchi Universe collection, to get a better understanding of Tenchi in Tokyo.  The episodes on the tape were great, involved heartbreak and many conflicts and leaves you hanging for more, definitly one of the must buys!",988848000,,566,4.423076923076923

Music is terrible, and voice overs don't fit the characters. I wish I could get my money back",1522368000,,130,4.24
7849558,4,6303500021,"Great animation but is subpar compared to the show, music is a bit heavier than any eurobeat more like jap.rock, most original voice actors but a few voice swaps... If you buy the combo I received a useless DVD so be warned",1521072000,,223,4.333333333333333
7849559,3,6303500021,I love initial d! its a great remake but...whats the point in the second dvd? it shows a clip of the producers or something...and thats it. why even bother when its also in the first disk?,1520467200,,188,4.25
7849560,5,6303500021,"Initial D is one of my favorite anime shows hands down. This particular version will get you up to speed if you're not fortunate enough to find the 5 stages of episodes, and the extra stages that are out there. This episode covers the first part of what season one was all about. If you're a fan of the music from the show, be prepared, it's got a different feel to it, but still very good. The animation is very good quality, and really just pulls you into the story. If you love car movies the way I do, not just the fast and furious franchise, but Gone in 60 Seconds, Baby Driver and Redline you will love Initial D. Give it a shot, you may find yourself scouring the web for anything else you can find. Initial D? A+++",1520035200,,722,4.164285714285715

7849563,5,6303500021,"I found the film to be most interesting and one to be viewed.  The story deals close to history as to what happened to Setting Bull and his people. If you love history,you love this film.",1280707200,,187,4.194444444444445
7849564,5,6303500021,"Teaser; Dragons weren't just legends - they were real. The four Ryudo brothers possess supernatural speed and strength, but whenever they lose control, they transform into terrifying, uncontrollable dragons with incredible destructive powers.
I enjoyed this series. As always, there were underlying legends from Japanese mythology which were pervasive throughout. But I could still understand the story. It was presented in Japanese with English subtitles.
There is a very strong Anti-American sentiment, but it is aimed at leadership actions without thought of consequence for American's and Japanese. Throughout is the theme of The Responsibility of Leaders and Rulers; Caring for the population; Pride in one's Heritage and Nationality.",1248307200,,739,5.851851851851852
7849565,5,6303500021,"""Ninja Nonsense"" was originally shown on the anime fan circuit as 2X2=Shinobuden. It's something of a slapstick situation comedy, with a ""naive but cute"" female ninja (yes, she even wears pink), a straightman-playing everyday high school girl, a pervy ninja master (who is literally a round yellow ball with eyes), and a bevy of countless male ninjas with a bit too much adolescence and testosterone.

It's definitely not ""South Park"" in that its only offensive shtick is its PG-13 male adolescent jokes. It's hardly suitable for young children, but its content is certainly less strong than Comedy Central. When our predominantly male anime club saw this series, we had a great time and often laughed out loud. If you like low-brow slapstick comedy, I highly recommend this anime series.",1172707200,5,788,5.108527131782946

ALSO IT HAS SAMPLES FROM EVERY SONG ON EVERY ALBUM HE DONE WHICH WAS THE ICING ON THE CAKE. I LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT.  BUY IT, ITS WORTH GETTING.",1080864000,2,296,3.774193548387097
