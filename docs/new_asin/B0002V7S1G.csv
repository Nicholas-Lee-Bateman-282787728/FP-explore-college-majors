8032595,1,B0002V7S1G,"If you're looking for a good whodunit, forget this one.  Melodramatic soap opera only, not one earned emotion, one-dimensional stick figure characters, wooden representations of social and personal issues relating to crime and justice.

If I could give it a zero, I would.",1206835200,,272,5.3023255813953485
8032596,5,B0002V7S1G,"VERDICT IN BLOOD is one of four Canadian made for TV movies in the Joanne Kilbourn mysteries.  Wendy Crewson does a solid job as Joanne, a former cop who is now working as a tv correspondent.  An old friend, a judge (Sally Kellerman) is murdered in her home, the apparent victim of a burglary gone wrong.  Kilbourne joins her new beau detective (Shawn Doyle) to investigate the killing.  There are plenty of suspects:  an ex-con (Robert Davi) who is running a halfway house for kids; the victim's two daughters; a blackmailing lawyer; and a local kid that Kellerman provided shelter for.  These movies are entertaining in a MURDER SHE WROTE kind of way.  Cerebral, with little violence and heavy plotting.  I first saw A KILLING SPRING, and enjoyed it immensely too.  If you're tired of plotless special effects gory movies, the Joanne Kilbourne series is well worth your time.",1109116800,11,877,4.832214765100671
