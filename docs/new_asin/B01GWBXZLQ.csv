8764051,2,B01GWBXZLQ,"This is a no or very low-budget film that deserves credit for the effort of its filmmakers, but not much else in my opinion.

The ""zombies"" here talk and reason, and have only a painting of white on their face to ""distinguish"" them. There is no traditional zombie action and this was a turnoff for me.

The story is all over the place, with ""jokes"" about the town's pansexual preacher one moment, and then everything seeming all serious and horrifying the next, then back to lighthearted comedy, and to and fro for the rest of the movie.

And the gore, which is not used with any imagination, is plentiful in some scenes (though it amounts to little more than zombies running their hands through blood and meat and eating it), but totally lacking in others.

Filmed in what may be some sort of historic ""Old West"" site (never mind that the setting is North Carolina), but with only a limited number of horses and costumes, this should have been great, campy horror fun. Maybe I'm being too hard on it though, and viewers should give it a try for themselves.  Once again, credit to the filmmakers for effort and may they get better as they go.",1484438400,,1142,4.524271844660194

8764053,5,B01GWBXZLQ,"I do this, all the watching of horror movies, to learn. And today I had a splendid learning opportunity. I saw two no-budget films (okay, okay, one wasn't horror, but a dark, bloody thriller, which is close enough) almost back-to-back, and one was a total failure, and one succeeded in every way.
I wish I had the time or patience to write this movie the review it deserves. All I can say is congratulations to everyone involved and I hope y'all get the recognition you deserve!
