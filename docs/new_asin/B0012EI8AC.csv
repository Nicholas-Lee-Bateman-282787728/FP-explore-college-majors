8245531,3,B0012EI8AC,"Prepositions matter.

I was looking for a Battlefield show from the first series on the Battle OF Normandy.

This show is from the second series of Battlefield and is called the Battle FOR Normandy.  If you actually look at the show, it's got the sub-title, ""The Battle for Caen"".

Never quite understood the issues and problems the British faced in their push for Caen on the eastern side of the Normandy beachhead.  This covers Monty's challenges quite well  However, if you're looking for things in the American sector, this DVD doesn't cover it.

Also, this DVD does not seem to work in older DVD players but works fine on my late model Macintosh computer.",1210723200,18,660,4.7368421052631575
8245532,5,B0012EI8AC,"The documentary on the battle of Normandy does a good job of laying out why the invasion was planned, what the strategies for defense and offense were and how misinformation on the part of the allies helped cement Hitler's view that the invasion would occur in the pas-de-Calais.

A good description of the weapons and the state of mind of the troops was well presented.  This tape sets up well ""The Battle of Normandy"" and you should watch the two in order.  I highly recommend this vhs and it's partner on the battle itself.",1107907200,,526,4.574468085106383
8245533,5,B0012EI8AC,"This documentary includes historical and rare archival footage, digital and graphic reconstructions, and excellent storytelling. Learn about Churchill's Operation Overlord, which was his reaction to Hitler's intentions to bring Britain to its knees. Also learn about FDR's decision to get involved, which was called ""insane"" at the time. And learn about the machines, vessels, ships, and tactics used during the war.",1100908800,2,416,5.836065573770492
