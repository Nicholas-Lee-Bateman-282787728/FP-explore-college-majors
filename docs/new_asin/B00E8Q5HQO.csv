This video contains beautiful music and great pictures, with a well enunciating child-narrator identifying and counting objects. It's one of the few videos that keep my one-year-old still (i find it a little mesmerizing as well), and I love hearing it because of the music. It's like you get three lessons in one (music familiarity, naming, and counting). The only quibble I have with this video is the advertisement for ""fun,"" which, not that it's un-fun, is not one of its best descriptors.",1422921600,,600,4.825242718446602
