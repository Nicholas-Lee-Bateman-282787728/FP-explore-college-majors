7166592,1,B00X8RONBO,"My daughter and I watched the first episode of this series and enjoyed it very much.  I was in Walmart and saw two more episodes, this one, ""When Calls the Heart, Heart of the Family"" and ""When Calls the Heart, Heart and Home.""  I was very excited to watch them with my daughter and husband on Halloween for a fun double feature family night.  Unfortunately, it seems I chose ""Heart of the Family"" to watch first.  I was very upset about the vast amount of drinking (alcohol) in the movie, the soap opera feel, and the non-existent children in the episode.  I actually fell asleep for about 5 or 10 minutes in the episode; it was that uninteresting.  I looked on the box cover and was surprised to find that that it didn't say that Michael Landon Jr. directed it as he did the first one, so I'm thinking that is what changed it.  Probably going to return the other episode I bought, ""Heart and Home,"" because I felt this one, ""Heart of the Family,"" was a waste of my time and money ($10 each at Walmart) and didn't want to risk a repeat.  Badly done on the alcohol consumption Hallmark and whoever directed this episode.  I don't want my daughter to watch this series now, so we're passing.",1446508800,3,1190,4.397260273972603

7166596,5,B00X8RONBO,"Gather the family together (no electronics allowed), a cup of something sweet and warm and enjoy one of the latest episodes of this well known series!
Michael Landon Jr. directorial talents and Janette Oke's inspirational novel comes to life once more in this episode and the actors are so likable, you cannot but get into the story. In fact it is a toss between that beautiful Mountie uniform and the ladies' finery!

This is everything in one: a bit of romance, an adventure and a lesson for any of us: together as a family, we can overcome obstacles no matter how trivial or serious.

This is one of those series which you might say is timeless, the scenery featured is breathtaking and the ladies' costumes continues to be a hit with any romantic!

This one was a 5 Stars!

7166615,5,B00X8RONBO,"Jack and Elizabeth are still avoiding acting that they are more then they are to each other. What a man though, she would be a fool to not fall for this guy. He cares so much about her that he built her a school. He also sleeps in a barn and takes care of things while Elizabeth helps a single dad take care of his kids while he is away. HOWEVER, Elizabeth's childhood friend has come to town and believes he is the GUY for Elizabeth.

One of our newer characters has a bigger storyline with the introduction of her advice column Ask Mary Rose. However many think it may be too progressive for the people of the town. You've got to love this character. She is a spicy one!

We also have some shadiness going on with the new mayor! He will do anything to control his villagers even if that means breaking the law.

Oh and Bill Avery (Jack Wagner/AKA Frisco Jones) has returned and is definitely not the man we thought him to be AND this time he was followed by his WIFE Nora (Kristina Wagner/AKA Felicia Jones (Sorry I am a huge General Hospital fan and have been for over 38 years).

Clara is back in town and working with Abigail. Mother-in-law and new daughter-in-law have a wonderful new relationship, one that I think will be very important to Abigail. They obviously both need someone to care for and hopefully heal with.

The struggles of the people of Hope Valley bring us back to a time when life was purer, honest, and the problems were based on the time of year, the weather and whether you had a successful crop.

What I love most about this show is how family friendly it is. I never have to change the channel because an inappropriate scene surprised me and the kids are awake. This is a wholesome show that everyone in your family can watch.",1440460800,,1755,4.351681957186544

7166618,5,B00X8RONBO,"I have absolutely fallen for the series When Calls the Heart, produced by Michael Landon Jr, and based on the novel by Janette Oke. Now part of the Hallmark Channel this series takes viewers back to the good old days of family entertainment, where good wholesome values and love can still be found without all the questionable content families want to see in their television shows, much like the old Little House on the Prairie series we appreciated quite awhile ago.

In the second series, Heart of the Family brings us back to those beloved characters we fell in love with in the first season. Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing)  and Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow)are facing a series of challenges in their relationship when Charles Kensington is thrown in the mix, a childhood friend from Elizabeth's past who believes he is the right man for her and has garnered her father's support as well. Seeing that her mother is well, Elizabeth returns to Coal Valley only to learn some changes have taken place, and for one, a new town name, Hope Valley now. School is just ready to start again, and Jack can't wait to show Elizabeth the schoolhouse he has built for her along with the help from others in town.

Mr. Henry Gowen has now become the new mayor and is still up to his underhanded ways to control those in town who refuse to adhere to the way he wants to conduct business beginning with Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin), and now added to the mix is Lee Coulter who is trying to revive the town through opening a sawmill now that the mine is closed down. Only Mr. Gowen will stop at nothing to ensure that Lee's business is brought down at all cost gouging him with fees and paperwork. Rosemary is still giving Lee a run for his money as the harder he tries to garner her interest, she keeps him at bay. She is now taking on an advice column in the local paper, ""Ask Mary Rose!"" She believes the women in Hope Valley will take her advice because her life is filled with glamour and romance!

Just when you think it couldn't get any seedier, Bill Avery returns hoping to persuade Abigail of his true intentions despite the fact he remains married. He seems to be up to no good dealing with counterfeiters but assures Jack that he is merely working undercover to expose who the head of the operations really are. Abigail meanwhile begins to accept the help of her newly discovered daughter in law Clara, who is trying to find a fresh start in town by being courted by the young men of Hope Valley. But Abigail is still dealing with the loss of her husband and son, and believe it's too soon for Clara to date, but is it?

I received When Calls the Heart: Heart of the Family compliments of Hallmark Channel, Word Films, and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside of a free copy of the DVD and the opinions contained are my honest and personal ones. The running time on this DVD is 88 minutes and includes exclusive behind the scenes interviews with your favorite characters. I love this series, because it takes us back to a much simpler time in history and I've always been a huge fan of westerns and historical romances. Just like in life, things aren't always each to work out, much like the relationships we see happening in Hope Valley. They offer us a chance to see the consequences played out when they make the choices they do. I only wish there were more television shows like this. For me this one rates a 5 out of 5 stars.",1439769600,2,3509,4.493730407523511
7166619,5,B00X8RONBO,"The Hallmark T.V. series of When Calls the Heart just gets better and better. In this episode called Heart of the Family Elizabeth finally gets back to Hope Valley and reunites with Jack. They make such a great couple, don't they?!
  What I like about these shows are they have funny, touching and very serious topics included in each episode.
  When city/country girl Elizabeth helps a local farmer with his children and farm while he is gone the laughs begin. Of course Jack comes to help and lends a hand, which is greatly needed.
  Bill Avery is after a counterfeiting ring, but is very mysterious, which makes a person wonder is he a good guy or bad guy.
  Also low and behold Charles Kensington shows up and upsets things. He claims he is just there on business. I just don't care for Charles to me he seems like trouble.
  Very interesting, entertaining DVD. Love the When Calls the Heart series and I highly recommend it. If you haven't seen any of the shows buy them on DVDs to catch up, because Season three is coming soon.

7166620,2,B00X8RONBO,"WHAT HAPPENED?!  Where are the stories in the lives of Coal Valley citizens that were introduced in season one?  Someone slipped in while we were waiting for the story to continue and decided that they would start over.  What the heck?  There may be a couple of plot lines remaining but they are not executed with the same quality of script or character development.  I will give a ""nod"" to characters Lee and  Rosemary for being lovable.

Where are the characters - our friends from season one?!  The town's population has changed ""over-night"" with no explanation or farewells.  Disturbing.  In the first season, the children offered further insight into the adult story lines as well as being capable of being the focus of a side plot.  Not in season 2.  Children are barely seen and hardly heard.  It's a town of adults with soap-opera scripts.  Did they think that the removal of main adult characters and children would serve to serve to ""tighten the ship""  On the contrary.  The holes it left are mortal

Where is the authenticity that charmed us?  We do not need the remaining characters showing up with everyone sporting a ""Glamor Shots"" make-over.  These are women of the western frontier and they wore their hair up, thank you.  Do I really need to explain why?  Don't get me started on their dress and satin lined coats.

Where is Elizabeth with her journaling?  In season one it offered a moment for Elizabeth to impart to herself and the viewers her thoughts that are not vocalized.  That was an opportunity, short and sweet, to make a personal statement.

This is an artistic waste for a creative junction of bringing in new ideas (the sawmill coming to town) with the existing story lines.  Oh, the events that could have spawned!

I could go on - but I will leave with this:  We feel our intelligence has been insulted.
