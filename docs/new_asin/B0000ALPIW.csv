1908356,3,B0000ALPIW,"The movie was okay,I think the price was a little too high for my price range,but other than that it was how it described.",1359504000,,122,4.125
1908357,5,B0000ALPIW,"""The Christmas Box,"" a Hallmark movie, fits in with old classic Hollywood and some more modern Christmas season favorites, this one with the theme of coming around to what's important after all.  It quickly became a favorite with its initial and subsequent airings, spawning a prequel giving background on Mary (the elderly lady's) past with her husband and child.

Young couple with five year old daughter cramped in a small apartment, wife working as building manager with all those hassles, husband working night and day trying to build a business, wife trying for a breakout for them, bidding for more space and family time.  She finds an ad to do meals and light housekeeping for an elderly lady in a multi-winged estate-like mansion, coaxes hubby along for the interview.  That portion was pretty funny, with the reluctant hubby cracking on the situation, both about and during the interview, wife eager to please and the old lady a humorless tartar.  Even the hopeful little daughter was daunted.  But, they get the job and in they move.  True to previous form, dear young hubby continues to chafe under contact with ""Brunhilda,"" who is equally displeased, ticking him off in acidic tones for various ""infractions.""  However, true to her form, the wife is anxious to please and have this place work out, which earns her initial restrained approval from Mary.

Richard Thomas is no longer John Boy folks.  He is a talented actor.  His interaction with Mrs. Parkins in the interview and subsequent confrontations yields appreciable reactive gratification for its effect.  The interview alone was at least a three titter segment at the conflict of humors, especially between hubby and Madam Formidable.  His comebacks are well timed, appropriate and effectively nuanced.  Yet, the indomitable dragoness, though softening, always prevails.  As she begins to actually develop relationships with the wife and daughter, you see her begin to take on hubby as a project.  His frustration is clear and understandable.  He attempts to confront her with it, being fully fed up with her quixotic style, in the instant case, manipulating a ride from him on his way to work.  He couldn't be more straight about it, asking her what is it she wants from him.  Her level response is ""a ride home; be here at 2.""  Poor guy. But pretty funny.

The angel dream thing and the spontaneous playing of the music box, which only he hears, are fanciful. And, this goes along with about every old and new Christmas movie having an element of the same, sometimes explained, sometimes readable, sometimes just an improbable.  Common element with the genre.  If you don't like the genre, best to just move on.

As this goes along, with Mary's health declining, Richard becomes more involved, making honest attempts to connect with Mary, beginning to realize his overall disconnect from family life.  His portrayal here, conversations with his business partner and interaction with his wife are convincing and effective.  The wife holds her own throughout, and they endure in their love, despite their conflict over priorities.  The little girl, Jenna, is a sweetheart, a natural little five year old.  He decides on the way back from the hospital one day to visit the cemetery where Mary visited every week, and discovers her daughter's grave with the angel marker, the same angel he saw in his rather disturbing recurring dream.  A last visit to the Christmas box in the attic with its letters from Mom (Mary) to her departed daughter, expressing her love and desire to be reunited with her one day, furnish the final pieces to his puzzle about the whole thing.

This is a beautiful experience, with depth and effective portrayals of people deepened and enriched by their developing love and care for someone who becomes part of their lives and their becoming an inestimable comfort to her final days of life.

The experience is complete to me with this film.  While ""Timepiece,"" the later produced prequel to the story, was well enough written, it was also pretty intense, not as well acted and unnecessary to me for the impact and fullness of the story.  In my viewing, the flavor of ""The Christmas Box"" was more edifying and it said it all for those having ears to hear.",1355788800,,4250,4.932489451476793
1908358,5,B0000ALPIW,"How convenient that these two movies are available in ONE collection for a nice price.

1908359,5,B0000ALPIW,These two movies are a classic.  I watch the Christmas Box every year and just wanted in on DVD.  Timepiece is a touching story.  It is definitely something worth owning.,1324512000,,170,4.6
1908360,5,B0000ALPIW,"If you are in search of perfect Christmas films, something so good that you would be thrilled to watch any time of year that you need a lift -- I promise that you could not do any better than The Christmas Box / Timepiece! These are the kinds of films I grew up watching. These are two beautiful stories about faith and love, even for a man who finds the concept of a diety to be ""incomprehensible.""

With hope there is love and transformation.

Don't we need to experience that any time of year?",1292976000,,496,4.26595744680851
1908361,5,B0000ALPIW,"I can see why these two movies are now in collectible status.  They are two of the best ever shown on Hallmark Channel.  I was elated to be able to find them.  The seller was great, too.  Very prompt and the movies arrived in perfect shape.  Thank you so much for making these collectibles available.",1269043200,,300,4.381818181818182
1908362,4,B0000ALPIW,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition. What I have experienced is that there is a descrepency between when Amazon.com says an item has been shipped and the actual day the seller ships the item.  Also, even though an item may have been sent Priority mail, independant contractors do the delivering.  When I traced my item it said the DVD was at the Post Office, calling the Post Office, I was told after checking their electronic data, that there was no record of the item ever being shipped or received. We received the item the next day.  The item was received within the expected timeline but perhaps Amazon.com should have a more accurate knowledge of when the item was (actually) shipped.  This would reduce the buyer's anxiety of if and when the item would be received.  This being a quality issue, Amazon.com still provides a great and valueable service to the consumer.",1262995200,,875,4.768211920529802

1908364,5,B0000ALPIW,I was very happy with my experience purchasing The Christmas Box and Timepiece DVD.  It arrived within a few days of purchasing it and it was in perfect condition.  I had been trying to find this DVD since last Christmas to add to my collection of Christmas movies.  In my opinion this duo should become a part of the timeless classics we love to cry over at Christmas time.  They are both very special movies that I will enjoy for years to come.

1908367,4,B0000ALPIW,"I liked the first part very much. It's not what I'd remembered having seen it many years ago, but I'm glad to have it in my collection. I also read the book prior and the adaptation was great.",1237161600,,192,4.078947368421052

1908370,5,B0000ALPIW,"In my opinion, ""The Christmas Box"" and ""Timepiece"" adaptations of Richard Paul Evans' heart-warming books are the new Christmas classics. How refreshing it is to hear an author who invokes God so unapologetically and is unabashedly proud of it, & then have the luxury of it being so well received. The performances by Maureen O'hara, James Earl Jones among others are stellar and should not be missed by anyone. These are simple stories, but speak volumes about love, forgiveness,sacrifice, & of the never-ending bond between parents and children. I recommend these to all.",1205193600,,573,5.172043010752688

Richard Thomas, Maureen O'Hara and Annette O'Toole do a fabulous job of acting in the movie.  To me, ""The Timepiece"" wasn't a movie I'd reach for to watch again and again.  Though James Earl Jones is a very fine actor, the movie just didn't grab me like ""The Christmas Box"".",1198368000,,361,4.523076923076923

1908388,5,B0000ALPIW,"Two excellent movies and both very family oriented. Christmas Box dicusses the everyday life of a loving family. The father concerned with working and expanding the business to make a better life for his family. At the same time finds out with help from a widow what is really important in life is to balance work and spend time with family.

Timepieces is a prequel and explains the life of the widow when she was young and how things came to be in her life as a wife and mother. It explains alot of what happenes in The Christmas Box from what the family experinces.",1168300800,,568,4.40952380952381
1908389,5,B0000ALPIW,"I enjoyed both movies. I will admit that I had a hard time ""getting into"" Timepiece until I realized it was Mary's story. Once I knew that, I couldn't wait to see it again.

Contrary to ""Just Me""'s review of The Christmas Box, many elderly people who live alone get a little ""icy."" (particular, meticulous, and the appearance of harshness) I thought Maureen O'Hara did a great job, and understated the ""iciness"" because you could see her heart of gold under her ""icy"" exterior. An astute observer watching every shot would see how she was affected by Jenna's ""book.""

Also, remember Mary didn't really WANT anyone to come live with her and she had lived alone for a LONG time. She was ""blackmailed"" by her attorney into getting some ""caretakers."" This created a dramatic friction. Then to have Richard unnervingly remind her of her late husband also contributed to the drama of the story.

Watch 'em together and you get the whole picture.",1167436800,,939,4.748466257668712
1908390,5,B0000ALPIW,"It is wonderful to see that a movie can still be made that doesn't include sex & violence, and when that movie comes with such a heart warming story it makes it extra special!

1908406,2,B0000ALPIW,"The classic story of The Christmas Box is enjoyed by everyone in our family - ages 8 to 44.  However, the movie version was absolutely horrible.  We could adjust to the modernization of the time period, but the hollow characters of Mary and Richard ruined a beloved story.

In the book, Mary is a kind and warm person.  A person for whom you instantly care for and feel tears of sorrow when she dies.  In the book, Richard is busy trying to grow his new business, too busy to spend much time with his family, but he still conveys warmth and values.  You can feel the bond grow between all the characters as they learn together the importance of family.

In the movie, Mary is harsh and cold.  Richard is flippant and sarcastic to the point of wanting to turn the movie off.  I expected more from these well known actors.  During the last 5 minutes of the movie things warm up, but too little too late.  A bond never fully developed between these characters.

This was truly a disappointment following such a lovely book.

As for the second movie on this DVD, The Timepiece.  We have not yet read the book and maybe that helps. The Timepiece was a beautiful movie.  And, thankfully, the characters in The Timepiece were warm and real.  Characters that you instantly bond with, cry and laugh with, and feel as they do.  Great acting by the whole cast.

If you can find The Timepiece alone on DVD, buy it.  Forget The Christmas Box movie version and stick with the wonderful book.",1135728000,,1477,4.464419475655431

1908408,3,B0000ALPIW,"This review is for THE CHRISTMAS BOX only as I haven't viewed TIMEPIECE yet.  The Richard Paul Evans runaway best seller is given the typical TV touch with only Maureen O'Hara's glorious presence elevating the film.  While Annette O'Toole has some glowing moments as the wife, Richard Thomas doesn't have the dramatic punch to give the character its dramatic conflict.  But O'Hara is wonderful as the mysterious elderly lady who takes Thomas and his family on as housekeepers, etc.  There's never really any explanation for Thomas' angel dreams nor any resolution of O'Hara's mysterious past.  While TIMEPIECE may offer some insight, it's not fair to a viewer to leave so many loose ends.  The pace of the movie is also lethargic and if it weren't for O'Hara's stellar performance, the movie would be a loser.",1134691200,,809,4.955555555555556
1908409,5,B0000ALPIW,"This is a movie about a couple, Richard and Keri (Played by Richard Thomas and Annette O'Toole) and their young daugher Jenna. After living in a small apartment decide to move into a stately mansion in Salt Lake City to care for an elderly woman, Mary Parkin (played by Maureen O'Hara.)
Mary Parkin is older, and in declining health. As Keri takes care of her, she learns of Mary's illness. She finds Mary has not long to live. Mary and Jenna take a liking to each other.  Jenna accidently breaks a vase and writes Mary a book about how sorry she was to have broken the vase, thinking the vase is very old and it not replaceable. Mary tells her she never liked the vase in the first place.
Richard is putting in long hours at a new Ski Supply business he and a friend have just opened.
Richard Thomas consequently is not spending enough time with his daughter during the Christmas season.
Jenna asks Richard to go find a Christmas tree with her and Richard is too busy, to find a tree with her. At this point Mary asks Richard what the first Christmas gift was. Richard cannot answer but says he will give it some thought.
Mary continues to ask him every few days, what the gift was, and Richard is not able to answer.

During the night all of the sudden Richard is having nightmares about a Christmas Box that is found in the attic.
This box begins to haunt Richard as he tries to unfold the mystery of the box. He is unable to sleep at nigt. He keeps seeing an angel that looks like a child. He goes to the box and finds letters and reads the love letters written about the angel (child)
In the process Mary Parkin who sees that Jenna needs to be with her Father more tries to make Richard understand the true meaning of Christmas.
I have to stop at that point because I will give the plot away.
This is an outstanding Christmas movie that will get you in the Christmas mood. This movie is very heartwarming and might even shed a tear or two. This is my favorite Christmas movie ever.
Timepieces is a prequal of The Music Box and it deals with David Parkin and how they meet and she goes to work for him and how they fall in love.
David gives her a timepiece, there is a tragic accident that David and Mary have to overcome.
The events lead up to the Christmas Box.
Both are very good movies, but in my mind the Christmas Box is much better",1132531200,,2342,4.2725225225225225
1908410,5,B0000ALPIW,"The Christmas Box and The Timepiece are both based on the books by Richard Evans. I have seen them both on TV and can't wait to get them on DVD. What is so interesting about the books are that they are based on true stories. Like one reviewer said the main character in the Christmas Box is named Richard Evans.

The Christmas box is a good family movie but the Timepiece I would save for older kids because there is a fire, a death, and a murder. Language is not a problem in either which in today's society is hard to find.

These movies are well worth your time.",1105920000,,565,4.174311926605505
1908411,5,B0000ALPIW,"""The Christmas Box"" is my favorite Christmas movie. It's about a guy who works too much and doesn't spend time with his family around Christmas time, and who has to learn what is important for a Christmas miracle. Very sad and pretty.
And ""Timepiece"" is even better. It's a prequel, sort of, which tells the story about Mary Parkin and what happened to her family. Also very sad and pretty, and it has Naomi Watts and James Earl Jones as well.
Two wonderful TV movies that are just amazing to watch at Christmastime with your family.",1071619200,,533,4.5625
1908412,5,B0000ALPIW,"As incredibly sappy as it sounds, ""The Christmas Box"" and its prequel ""Timepiece"" are heartwarming. Now both are included on DVD, letting us into the bittersweet story of the Parker and the Evans families, from the 1940s to the 1990s.
In ""The Christmas Box,"" the Evans family is interviewed by elderly, wealthy widow Mrs. Parkin (Maureen O'Hara) for a live-in status, since their apartment is too small for them now. To their surprise, they are brought in on a trial basis, and mom Keri (Annette O'Toole) and daughter Jenna (Kelsey Mulrooney) rapidly grow closer to the old woman. But Richard (Richard Thomas) is often busy -- so busy that he's almost never there for his family. But Mrs. Parkin's mysterious past, a cache of old letters, and a strange question lead him back to the first gift of Christmas.
""Timepiece"" shifts back in time to the end of World War II. David Parkin (Kevin Kilner) is the owner of a successful, extremely busy company. He takes on a new secretary, Mary Anne Chandler (Naomi Watts), and begins to fall in love with her. But she has a secret: She's pregnant and unmarried. Undaunted, David marries her and they raise her daughter as their own. But when David's friend Lawrence (James Earl Jones) becomes the target of a gang's racism, something tragic will happen to the new family.
The films are rather different in tone, although both will probably leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling, especially during the Christmas season. ""Christmas Box"" is a Christmas movie with a touch of mystery (who are the letters to? And what happened in Mary Anne's past?), whereas ""Timepiece"" is a straightforward family/friends story with a touch of tragedy and Christmas. They both have some major differences from the original novels, but the spirit of them is still in there.
The acting is more or less spotless in both movies. Richard Thomas and Annette O'Toole are fantastic as the couple who bickers a bit, but love each other dearly; O'Hara is astounding as Mary Parkin in her old age. James Earl Jones (of ""Star Wars"" fame) and Naomi Watts (of ""Ring"" fame) are also wonderful in ""Timepiece."" The child actors are somewhat flat at times (especially the kid who plays Andrea) but they don't detract from the stories at all.
Tis the season to be mildly sentimental, which is why people watch ""It's a Wonderful Life."" For a couple of beautiful, lovable films with good acting and a bit of heartbreak and a dollop of romance, this is a must-have. Genuinely charming.",1071360000,,2481,4.799065420560748
