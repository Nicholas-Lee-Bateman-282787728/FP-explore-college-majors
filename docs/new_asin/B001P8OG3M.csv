3742807,5,B001P8OG3M,ILOVE this show its my fave season yet! I LOVE izzie its her first ever big storyline .  I cant wait till it comes out!,1245801600,,119,3.76
3742808,4,B001P8OG3M,I just can't believe they put Hahn on the cover.  It really felt like two or more seasons. Before Hahn after Hahn. Before the tumor after the tumor. The finale was GREAT!!!!! I actually cried for Izzie and George.  The season had it's highs.  It definetily had its lows. Overall I was satisfied. Not the 5 star rating seasons 1-3 got. Not the 2 Star rating Season 4 would have gotten if I cared enough to write about it. Come on Shonda bring back the magic.,1244851200,2,457,4.290697674418604
3742809,3,B001P8OG3M,"They should have changed the show's title for this season to ""Izzie's Anatomy"" because all the other plot points were marginalized around Katherine Heigl's character. I'm sure she'll have a lovely film career, but they should have let her out of her contract sooner. T.R. Knight's George became invisible this season, not even appearing in some episodes. So, he leaves too. I really hope the show's writers come up with some new top shelf plot lines.",1243728000,6,450,4.934210526315789
3742810,2,B001P8OG3M,"I am sick of Grey's Anatomy. It started with the ferry accident in season 3, and since then it has gone downhill. The storylines, the writing and the generally pain in the arse characters(with the exception, once again, of Justin Chamber's Alex Karev) made me give give up on it. I presume this is because it first appearred as a mid-season replacement, and did not expect to get past a second season and thus used up its main storylines. Turns such as Izzie-George, Callie the lesbian and Superman Derek Shepard left a sour taste in my mouth. There was no planning, no foresight and most importantly respect for the viewer's intelligence. Dead Denny's love affair with Izzie finally pushed me over the edge(although it could have been any number of events this season), and with great happiness I finally said ""enough"". and moved on.
 Since giving up I found Pushing Daisies, Mad Men, Dexter and finally got into The Sopranos.  These shows have great writers, well planned and excuted stories, while Grey's now relies on cheap twists and cliff hangers to keep viewers hooked.",1243296000,11,1076,4.842391304347826
3742811,5,B001P8OG3M,It just gets better and better and I cannot wait for the next season to return!,1243296000,,79,4.0
3742812,5,B001P8OG3M,"SPOILERS---DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED
Somewhere halfway through this 5th season, I decided it would be my last. I was even tempted to stop right then and there.  I think this happened around the same time that Izzie was having mind-boggling sex with Denny (the dead ex).  But I decided to wait until the end.  Who knows why?

And I am so glad I did.  I have just finished watching the season finale.  I have been downloading the episodes from iTunes since the season will not be out in DVD for a while.  I still wanted to write a review in case you are hesitating to buy this season.

So without further delay or hesitation I say BUY IT.  The 2nd half of the season more than makes up for the weaknesses in the first half, and the season finale is so good that it's worth to get it just for this.  Well, to be honest, the season finale is devastating.  So much so that it reignites your desire to watch the show and come back for the 6th Season.
But getting back to Season 5....there are a few reasons why this season is very good:

1.  The Derek/Meredith situation is resolved and this is great.  It is good to see a happy ending to these 2, especially after 4 years of following their ups and downs.  The show's creator wanted to deliver this to the fans and she made the right call on this. I think people would have been turned off if Meredith and Derek had  split permanently or if their story would have kept being dragged on.

2.  What started as the unlikely couple of Sloan and Lexi, has developed into a really nice story line where he sheds his playboy lifestyle for a more committed relationship.  Lexi's character is also growing quite nicely, from an almost defenseless ""little girl"" to a mature woman that centers Sloan.  They are also quite beautiful together as a couple, and well I'm really rooting for them....

3.  Cali is finding happiness with Arizona.  I love the Arizona character, and the actress that plays her is absolutely great.  It is a treat to see this couple blossoming.  It was a great decision to get rid of Cali's ex girlfriend...she was a bitter and sad person and not at all matched to Cali's lighthearted nature.  Arizona's bubbly personality is great for Cali.  I love how they wrote in her skating around the hospital....On the other hand she has been instrumental in  Dr. Bailey's discovery of her softer side and her preference for pediatrics as her specialty.

4.  Christina and Owen are going through major bumps, but there's an intensity to their relationship that is great to watch, and by the end of the season, it's nice to see how their story evolves.

5.  While I was annoyed with Izzie's and Denny's story line, Katherine Heigl gives a great performance towards the end of the season, and so does the actor that plays Alex Karev.  Alex's character, so rough at times, shows an increased sensitivity as Izzie gets sicker, and well, it's heart-wrenching to see his pain.

THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOLLOW....STOP READING....OR ELSE.....

6.  The fact that George walks Izzie down the aisle is sweet and poignant.

7.  The moment when Meredith realizes that George is John Doe is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen on TV.  I had to watch it a couple of times and plan to go back to it.  She was amazing in that scene.

8.  When Izzie faces George, you realize that this could very well be the last time you see these 2 actors together.  One of them will surely die, perhaps both..... and this is just devastating.....
Now, apparently in real life, Katherine Heigl has stated that she wants to come back to the show, while Knight has stayed quiet on the subject.  So it's very likely George will die and Izzie will make it.....but it would just be wonderful if they both make it.  It's a credit to the writing that after being fed up with one and indifferent to the other, I now desperately wish for their return.

9.  Finally, the most amazing part of this season is that in watching events unfold and listening to Meredith's voice over in the season finale, you realize what a powerful lesson you are learning from the show.  We must tell the people we love how we feel, how important they are to us, how they have changed our lives; because everything can change in  a second.  I plan to do just that as soon as my husband walks in the door tonight.

If this can be done by a TV show, then there is greatness in it.

I am hooked all over again.  You will be too.",1242777600,146,4430,4.4183168316831685

3743002,4,B001P8OG3M,"***SPOILER HEAVY REVIEW***
I recently watched Season 5 in it's entirety after not having watched it since it originally aired. Of the first 5 seasons it is one of the better ones. I found it to be better than both 3 and 4, and almost as good as 2. Season 5 also had a lot of arrivals and departures throughout. There's the arrival of Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) who appears in the first 2 episodes of the season, and then returns later on. I can't get off of the fence when it comes to Owen. Sometimes I really like him, and then other times not so much. It's got a lot to do with his on again off again relationship with Christina Yang (Sandra Oh) who also happens to be my favorite character. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who was actually starting to grow on me, is gone after episode 7. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) comes to town in the following episode. A romance is teased between her and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), but it never really goes anywhere, and she too is gone after only 8 episodes. The first time around I didn't really care for Sadie, but after watching again I found the character a lot more likable. I couldn't help getting the vibe that ABC was a little uncomfortable with the lesbian storylines. This is all probably true, but I have no way of confirming it. This season also marked the arrival of Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), and the start of her relationship with Torres. I liked Arizona from the beginning, but part of me always wondered if her addition was just a way for the network to prove that they weren't homophobic. Once again this is only speculation, but it did seem that way, at least to me. Regardless, her and Torres are great together. Sadly, this season would also be the last of George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). There is a noticeable shift about halfway through the season where you'll notice it starts to show him less and less. I always felt like George was the heart of the show. The kind of character that almost anyone could relate to. I have a hard time rationalizing his last two episodes in my head though, and I'll get to that in just a minute. One of my favorite things about season 5 was that it marked the start of the relationship between Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh). Out of all the couples on Grey's Anatomy they were my favorite, and I enjoyed watching the beginning of their romance a second time. The other big thing that happens this season was that Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) learned she had stage 4 cancer. Early on it's obvious that something is seriously wrong, because she's having hallucinations about her dead fiance Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). It's not until late in the season that she discovers what's causing these hallucinations though. The final few episodes revolve around her fighting the cancer, and her friends coming to terms with it. Izzie plans a wedding for Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), but in the end they step aside and let Izzie and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) get married in their place. As a fan of Izzie and Alex it was great to see those two tie the knot, but their joy is short lived as Izzie's condition soon takes a turn for the worse. By the season finale things aren't looking good for Izzie, and now I'm back to what I have a problem with. Izzie and George have always claimed to be best friends, yet when Izzie is literally on death's door George decides to abruptly join the army? Seriously, he couldn't have held off until he found out whether or not she was going to be okay? It seems like a pretty selfish thing to do, and George never struck me as a selfish person. In the end it doesn't even matter, because George gets hit by a bus, and ultimately dies. I know T.R. Knight had decided to leave the show, and the whole army thing was just a way to trick fans into thinking that was how he was going to do it, but it doesn't fit with who the character is. Not for me. The George I knew would have waited until he found out whether or not Izzie was going to be okay before joining the army. I know why the show did it. So that everyone would be shocked to find out that the bus victim was in fact George, and it worked, but I feel that it came at the expense of who the character was. I could definitely see George joining the army, because that's the kind of thing a selfless person does, but not when his best friend needed him most. This review has already gone on longer than I thought it would, so I'm going to wrap it up. Season 5 is a great season. In my opinion, one of the last great seasons, because after this the quality of the show really starts to decline.",1452556800,,4651,4.396751740139211

3743096,4,B001P8OG3M,I didn't watch the show when he first aired on tv.  I am now addicted to surgery and love the show (the medical part).  I have to admit the personal storylines are annoying.  The couple I like the best are Izzy and Alex.  The couple I like the least are Meredith and Derek.  These season was GREAT except for the following: the writers all but cut George out of the show.  George and Izzy were best friends.  George all but abandoned her during this season because the writers decided they didn't like George on the show; it makes me so mad.  Izzy would have told George first and George would have walked her down the isle because he wanted to not because she was sick.  George also would have spent the last few days with Izzy.  George and Izzy were cheated out of their friendship relationship this season because the writers wanted decreped Owen to be popular on the show.,1429833600,2,876,4.41875

As 7 and 8 grew into another story the issues were lent to old stars who had lost their places within their own shows. The concept remains well written but the life of the story is relative to the initial interns. Loosing Izzy and O'Malley was a big mistake in the timeline. Christina should not have had an abortion. I should have changed her to pediatrics. Owen should have shown some balls as a Vet to the save the life of his child..,1369440000,,503,4.3052631578947365

This one is not bad, but I don't like how the story goes.  I also think that getting rid of ""Dr. Burke"" was a mistake.  Yang and Burke had wonderful chemistry.

 Izzy's character went from funny and charming to unberable to me.  Maybe the constant rumors of her leaving the show for the big screen, forced the writers to create a story with frequent possibilities to end this character.

As I live in the UK I have to import it and randomly I seem to get hit for the tax each time. so, not sure if I will be buying the next season and may have to reply on satilite TV for that!

3743604,5,B001P8OG3M,"I have been a fan of Grey's Anatomy since the first season and I was able to watch it on tv.  Since then, due to circumstances, I don't have the ability to watch the episodes weekly anymore, so I eagerly await the release of each new season and watch the entire season almost without interruption. lol  Normally I am not a fan of medical series since they invariably have scenes with blood and gore.  But somehow, Grey's Anatomy has a way of including shows with the reality and grittiness of a top trauma hospital without seeming to focus on the bloody side of emergencies and surgeries.  Of course, the big draw for me is the story line of ALL the characters in the series, each with their own little quirks and eccentricities.  It is so easy to become deeply involved in each character's personal struggles, achievements, and day-to-day lives that you can't wait for the next episode to see what happens next.  I've mourned with Izzie, cried for Christina, hoped for George, initially hated Alex but am now seeing his new side, and of course, rode the roller coaster with Meredith and Derek.  Not to mention all the other characters I have come to know and love.  If you're looking for a series that has it all: suspense, romance, mystery, comedy, and medical jargon mixed in, this is the series for you.  I think it has something for everyone, and I must not be alone because season 6 is now on the air.  This is a purchase that you won't regret, and will watch more than once.

3743626,5,B001P8OG3M,"Shonda Rhimes outdid herself this season with the Denny-Izzy storyline.  It was practically a movie in and of itself with Ms. Heigl & Mr. Morgan playing their ill-fated romance to death DO US NOT part.  On the other side, Izzy seems to finally made of man of the chip on his shoulder bigger than a boulder Dr. Alex Korev.  Also well played by Justin Chambers

Meredith & Derek became almost secondary characters until Derek's breakdown following an unsuccessful surgery - which was not a bad thing as the show tended to rest a little to heavily on McDreamy & Mare and there on-again off-again silliness.  Meredith was much more interesting interacting with her Mom's diaries, dealing with her mixed feelings for the ""chief"" and with her ""person"" Christina Yang.  And speaking of my favorite cold-hearted surgical resident, we finally found out a little about how she got that way through her sudden passion for McArmy surgeon Owen Hunt.  McKidd was a perfect addition to the cast & a great foil for Yang, who needed a man with a little more angst than Mcdreamy & McSteamy provide.
McSteamy & little Gray gave Gray's the comic turn it needed to keep from drowning in the drama, with Lexie showing Dr. love 'em and leave 'em Sloan what it feels to be the woman in the relationship.  Also bringing up the comedy factor was the adorable Sara Ramirez as Dr. Callie Torres, who when not fixing broken bones was exploring her sexuality with both genders.

Chandra Wilson deserved special praise for taking Dr. Bailey to a whole other level in Season 5.  Watching her compassion while hold a dying child, or like a little girl at Christmas with her new medical equipment or facing divorce she was all over the place emotionally.  What a performance.

Eric Stoltz was brilliant as the psycho under Meredith's care, while James Pickens, Jr., as Dr. Richard Webber is the glue that holds it all together as the chief of staff of Seattle Grace.  I hope next season we see a bit more of Dr. Webber & his wife, especially in light of his confession to Meredith about how his relationship with Ellis and effect on her.

T.R. Knight was marvelous as George found himself trying to catch up to his fellow residents and looking for his place in the medical world.

3743661,5,B001P8OG3M,"I think the whole thing was good.
With Christina and Han, the way Christina dealt with Dr. Han was really good, she handled her character
real well and Dr Han really show he had the soldier trama In his past, plus with his ex fiancee.
Dr. O'Malley  , where he is being at that child's level when he wasn't going to have the surgery and pulls the fire alarm and when O'Malley later had to deal with the child again didn't want the I V and he had to show him how it is done and was after he allowed them to do it. then there is Bailey her strong attitude and softness with children hit
at the sometime that was a hard role to play. Plus when Richard had to ask patience wives or loved ones for there organ's for the child that needed parts from other donors. That is hard to have to ask the the relative this and the patient is brain dead, not ready to let them go for other sake.
Dr. Gray had built a house with candles and then they had to delay there wedding a lot. She was not ready for him yet. She is afraid that Derick doesn't want her crappy children and says yes I do. there was a episode where Derick
had killed a women while she was pregnant and couldn't get her back and got sued from the Husband that wanted his
wife back instead of baby , which I thought was sad , even though he said we could have another child but can't have another child again later. why give up a child that is almost term and you can advance the lungs so the child can survive. They might of been able to keep the child and mother. But that is life's tough choices that we have to be able to except in our lives. The choice of knowing if your child is going to survive and while you wife is critical too. Sometimes you lose them both.
Lizzy and her Ghost Fiance that was creepy. She only could see him but not others , so everyone had to think she
is losing it. And talking to herself, plus having sex seine with her dead fiance' is weird to except too.
then she finds  out later that she is dieing of cancer due to tumors and that's why her fiance' is there he is her tumor? then they operate on her and then she still see's him again which means another surgery.she also meets her fiance at the elevator, so surgery Goes well and then passes out no pulse. They are reviving her and nothing and this time she meets O'Malley at the elevator. and she hesitates. Then the program leaves you anticipations for next season.
Lexy Gray gets together with an older man which happens in real life anyway.
Dr. Sloan gets broken which no lady has ever done to him. Then he is fixed. He asks Lexy to move in with him and
Lexy got the Idea of marriage too.
The funny part that he says he is a better girl then her when buying the house.
This season has a lot of Kids in it. Which is tear breaking.
But they fight to get them well. Which is adrenaline time.
Then O'Malley gets hit by a bus by saving a lady almost getting killed .
He comes in and you can't even recognize him at all I didn't even know who that was, because I thought he was in listing at the army. Then he writes in Gray's hand three times until it hit her, and she really panicked.
Everyone jump right on it and tried to save O'Malley .
The part with Alex and Lizzy getting Married was awesome. what a gift to give when she admitted she loved Alex.
But down deep I know she will always remember her dead fiance. He gives part of him when she saved her eggs for
fertilization later and Alex was very uncomfortable of what he had to do , he said It is not how you make a baby.
Derek part where is angry at everyone and himself of the death of the women he killed. Gray never seen him that mad. But she let him alone and they had her come back to him to bring Linzy ex rays to him so he could operate on
her since he has a gift for this. So she got him back to surgery.
Callie wow what a change from one way to the other way of life. I have seen this in life before , She did do her
role very well with the women in her life. The women were able to live together with Christina and made out to be good roommates so far.
Christina is a tough character. Try's not to show her feelings. She does try to keep a professional approach towards things and she goes on. Even if she is hurt for that time she picks herself up and goes on with life.
The part with Christina is with Dr Han and his night time episode and he is chocking her.
I can not wait for the next season comes

I was worrying because the different regional codes of the dvdy, but it was very easy to change that coding-system on my laptop! Here in Germany we will get the fifth season split in two parts, so you have to pay about 25  for season 5.1 and another 25 for season 5.2!
So if you are able to understand the english versions, do it! I love watching my grey`s in the original version, with the original voices and no synchronisation!!

3743716,5,B001P8OG3M,"I have worshiped and adored Grey's Anatomy since the second season. It's been a ritual for me to turn off my phones and other electronic devices to glue myself to the television to watch this tantalizing series unfold. Although the show fell off the track in seasons 3, 4, and to some extent in the early part of this season; I watched every moment of it.  The storyline with Izzie was just hard to deal with at times, but i stuck by it.  I am so glad I did; the last half of the season was brilliant. SPOILERS follow: If you are a Meredith and Derek fan they have worked their issues out and are truly great this season.  The addition of Owen Hunt has brought new life back to the series, and to Christina.  While I wasn't to crazy about the pairing of Sloane and Lexie, they have really grown on me.  The crossover episodes with Private Practice were wonderful. The hundredth episode is one of the best, but the finale is what left me with chills.  From start to finish it is easily one of the most powerful episodes of the series. Meredith's realization of ""John Doe's"" identity as George was nothing short of incredible, the moment Izzie's memory returns and the she flat lines took my breath away, and Meredith's voice over telling the audience to say ""I love you"" to the people in our lives before they are gone makes you realize the importance of those three words.  However the final scene is what really makes the episode, with Izzie going into the elevator with her ""prom"" dress, and the door opening to George dressed in his army uniform, as they both flat-line, you realize it is very likely that one of them will not come out of this alive.  That scene is truly haunting, and the song that plays in that scene ""Off I Go"" by Greg Laswell makes the scene truly unforgettable. One thing I noticed is that the premiere, in terms of Izzie, mirrors the finale.  Izzie, at the end of ""Dream a Little Dream of Me (part 2)"", gets into the elevator in her dress and it opens to Denny, who is major part of her story line for the season, and in ""Now or Never"" the elevator opens to George. Heartbreaking, heartwarming, and full of just plain heart Grey's does not disappoint.  Buy this season of Grey's and watch every moment, even though at times it is frustrating, I promise when you get to the end it will all be worth it. If you're anything like me, you will want to watch it again and again to see what you missed the first time around.",1252972800,16,2443,4.361233480176211
3743717,5,B001P8OG3M,"In 2005, ""Grey's Anatomy"" became a critically acclaimed television series that would become ABC's top rated dramas and winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.

Created by Shonda Rhimes (""Private Practice""), the drama series revolves around a group of interns and their experience at Seattle Grace Hospital.  As well, as a few of the other doctors of the hospital.  Throughout the first four seasons, we see these interns become residents and experience relationship problems and also the stress and challenges they had to become a resident doctor.

For season five, ""Grey's Anatomy"" received its share of hype on entertainment magazines with rumors swirling of talent who were no longer going to be on the show and that tension was developing on the set.  For this fifth season, the season did start off with stories that seemed a bit farfetched and a tad bit hokey, but for the most part, redeemed itself for the second half with solid storytelling.

""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" features 24 episodes (Episodes 79-102) on six discs:

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16x9 televisions.  When it comes to television drama series, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is one of ABC's highly rated dramas that although filmed in a hospital setting for the most part of the series, season five definitely indulges in beauty during a major wedding scene which featured solid cinematography. And speaking of the wedding, that was one of the most enchanting wedding scenes that I have seen in a drama series.  Absolutely beautiful!

For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts.  For the most part, the fifth season does look very good on DVD.

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is clean and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes.  Personally, I found it much more appealing to have my receiver set at stereo on all channels.

The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" includes the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that when ""Grey's Anatomy"" season five started, I thought the series has lost its vibe and was becoming another ""ER"" like-clone where stories would simply become to farfetched and hokey.  But during the second half of the season, things simply changed.  We started to get solid storylines that built-up to the best season finale for ""Grey's Anatomy"" ever.

I think part of the mystique about the series this season was the hype and gossip about what was going on behind-the-scenes.  Who is leaving the show?  Who isn't leaving the show?  Would we even care for Izzie due to Katherine Heigl's behavior off-set?  The lesbian storyline.  The brain tumor storyline. Who is disgruntled?  Who isn't being utilized all that much in the show.  So, many things that could have gone wrong... but in the end, it was the writing for the series that managed to win viewers all over again.

From the cross-over with ""Private Practice"", the return of Denny, a wedding, many new characters and so much more... But personally, it was those final four episodes that made viewers remember why we stuck with over 100 episodes of this drama series.  Although, I can do without the icicle impaling  or the interns surgically experimenting on each other (which to me was just too campy).

As or the DVD, I was expecting episode commentaries (it would have been wonderful to hear commentary for the 1ooth episode and the season finale) and something a bit more for the special features section but for the most part, what is featured is quite satisfactory.

Overall, ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" may have started out a bit hokey and farfetched but the season redeemed itself right at the end and had its most significant season finale ever.  If you are a ""Grey's Anatomy"" fan, one again, another DVD box set worth adding to your collection.",1252972800,,5134,4.949707602339181
3743718,4,B001P8OG3M,"After Season 3 sucking in general, and Season 4 coming back until the writer's strike, I was a bit worried with the beginning of Season 5. It go go either way, and luckily the show went up, and towards the end, was back up to the standard that season 2 set.

New Characters: I was among those who didn't like Dr. Hahn, and wasn't sad to see her go. Arizona, her Peds Dr. replacement has been awesome, and I've loved her interactions with Callie. Mark and Lexie's relationship has been awesome to watch evolve. But Owen... omg Owen Hunt made this season for me. His character alone would be awesome, but his relationship with Christina has been my favorite of the season, and I'm glad he'll be back. Izzy and Alex FINALLY got their shizz together and decided to be mature responseable adults. Kind of. But her situation made it imparetive the they figure out their issues and get moving.

Meredith and Derek finally got all their major problems hammered out as well, so there wasn't a whole lot of drama there this season either.

I have to say this is my second favorite season, after season 2. I'm anxiously looking forward to Season 6 since we know who lives and dies, and to see how all the relationships play out!",1249344000,7,1217,4.497737556561086
3743719,5,B001P8OG3M,"Grey's Anatomy creater Shondra Rhimes does it again. The season started out great. The dream Mer had about Derrick left me glad that it was just a dream. I was iffie with the beginning of the Izzie and dead guy storyline, but knew that something amazing was going to happen. I was right. Elevator love letters was my favorite. (Other then the season finale). The best point made in this entire season was when Christina realized that Mer did change and she was healing. That opened a door for us to view Mer-Der in a new relationship and for Christina and Owen to take a chance. As for anyone that wonders why George fell to the back burner. The show has made no secret to him wanting out of his contract. T.R. Knight is an amazing actor and I hpoe to see him soon. They could never get a new actor to play George. The bottom line is, the redemption that Grey's gives is the moment they reveal what is going on with Izzie. It's a powerful story and I can't wait for Season 6 to come back. P.S. Thank for banning Hahn to the parking lot. She made me almost stop watching the show with her horrible attitude.",1249171200,2,1106,4.29665071770335
