487158,1,6302627001,"Okay, we have this former hitwoman who wants to get on with her life, but she is kind of coerced into killing five scumbags by some secretive organization.  The scumbags are nasty guys and gals who abuse, exploit and basically debase females in some ridiculous form or another.  The hitwoman gets her assignments by playing a video game called THE SILENCER.  Once she shoots her opponent in the game, her real quarry comes up, with some stupid accompanying jargon like their fatal flaws and what they do for a living.  The hitwoman has big cazoos and wears a black bra through most of the movie.  Along the way, she encounters her former hitman/partner/lover, who is determined to bring her back to his arms.  She also beds a young jock named Drew, who is killed by her ex-lover, and then she comes on to some pool player jock at the game arcade, who she obviously might care for.  Additionally, she saves a street girl from a devious future by shipping her off to be a mechanic at an old pal's auto shop.  The scenes flow without any kind of continuity, and the acting, well, suffice to say good actors like Chris Mulkey and Paul Ganus are lost in this drivel and the comely Lynnette Walden cannot carry this movie on (...) alone.  Dull and crude, THE SILENCER is one movie that should be.",1097539200,6,1290,4.525862068965517
487159,1,6302627001,"One star for the ""no glove, no love"" scene. All the rest is
worth minus 17. Truly appaling. I would not recommend this to
my worst enemy. OK maybe to her. It is beyond being one of
those ""so bad it is good"" type of movies. It is just plain bad.",1000252800,9,244,3.803921568627451

7828284,2,6302627001,"Angel, a hit woman (Lynette Walden) comes out of retirement to redeem herself and is assigned 5 targets from the sex slave trade which includes Morton Downing jr. The film opens up with a theme that sounds stolen from a bond film. There is video game involved in giving her ""Mission Impossible"" information. And one with very poor graphics. Her ex-boyfriend also spies on her.

Angel dresses rather scantily during the entire film, which was rather boring.

2 stars Lynette Walden's nude scene. Now available on a 50 film multi-pack.",1475884800,,533,4.911111111111111
