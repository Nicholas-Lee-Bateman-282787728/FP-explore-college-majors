1333730,5,B00003UC9X,This exercise/dance video is the best. I really enjoy working out to the tape. The lead dancer is very enthusiatic with her dancing and speaking. She really encourages to continue throughout the workout. The other dancers  are fun to watch too. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun  while exercising.,953683200,7,312,4.867924528301887
1333741,5,B00003UC9X,I found this DVD to be much more than I expected and rate it highly.  The teacher is excellent.  Wish she made more videos.,1264118400,,123,4.083333333333333
1333742,5,B00003UC9X,"I bought this as VHS 7 years ago and was successful in loosing 35 lbs in 3 months (using 3 days a week). I don't know if I ever go all the moves down completely but I always had a great time and was even able to use the moves I learned social dancing. What I've learned about most workout videos is that its more about getting in shape than getting the moves perfect; I find that for myself, I get the most out of the workout when I find my own rhythm and use the instruction as a tool to engage and motivate me. This workout does EXACTLY that. Sadly, I gave the video away when I sold my VCR and forgot what the name of it was and have been having a hard time tracking it down as DVD. I just found it on Amazon and am elated that I'll be able to use this again!!!",1263513600,2,764,3.8417721518987342

1333744,4,B00003UC9X,"nothing beats the real challenge of going to an african dance class & trying to follow along with a live instructor- but if you don't have the resources, whether it be time, money, location, etc- this dvd will help you obtain a basic knowledge of the types of movements involved in many afro- caribbean/afro-brazillian dances.",1251936000,,326,4.945454545454545
1333745,4,B00003UC9X,"Fun dance-based workout.

I would recommend for a wide range audience:

BEGINNERS may need to repeat the workout several times before they become comfortable with the steps, but most of the steps are not so inherently complicated that a beginner couldn't eventually do.  I would recommend for beginners to start out by concentrating on the arm/hip motions (not do the arm motions) and do the motions in a smaller, less exagerated way.

For those with bad knees etc, there are only a few jumping moves and they are easily modifiable to a non-impaction motion.

INTERMED/ADVANCED will find that the moves look simple and easy, but actually do give a great cardio/sweat workout because most of the workout is nonstop and uses large full body movements that include athe arms.

The DVD is divided into three 15minute sections.

You can do just one or several at a time.

Each segment starts wtih a ~3min WarmUp to loosen you up with mostly back rolls (which is relative to the workout that follows); even if you're doing more than one section at a time, the next ""warmup"" didn't feel like a waste of time because I appreciated stretching my back again and having a ""breather""  in between the more intense ""dance workout"" sections.

The rest of each section is a dance routine that you learn; the teacher introduces one step at a time, and then adds on a new step.

I like how there are a wide variety of moves so that it doesn't feel redundant and also makes your body move in ways that standard workouts might not.

I also like how she cues each step without saying left/right, so users can easily ""mirror"" her or do the moves on the same side she is (whatever you prefer)

Good production:

Quality camera shots show her feet & full body.

Talented & energetic ""students"" in sync with teacher. (except for a moment when one of the students went the wrong direction, but I felt this was a neglible 2 second blip)

Nice set.

Few minor drawbacks:

The live drummers play the same beat throughout, sounds very repetitive.

If you have a bad back you might want to skip out on this dvd (or at least do the motions smaller & slower until you feel comfortable with them).

Overall the majority of moves are sufficiently demo'd/taught.  However, in the the 2nd & 3rd workout there were 2 hip movements that I wish she had demo'd in slow-motion, because until I figure out these 2 moves, I'll look like a waddling chicken.

If you are interested in this video, it is sort of similar to Debra Ono's african dance and Vanessa Isaac's brazilian/samba dance DVD's.

(While I like all of these, I personally like this one more than Debra Ono's because this seems less cheesy and has more variety of steps)",1169424000,,2690,4.605042016806722

1333747,4,B00003UC9X,I found this exercise video to be a fun one.  I bought it when it came out on VHS so I have owned it for a while now.  I think it is a great workout and altough you don't really break a sweat unless you push yourself harder than the video it is still fun to do on easy days!  I feel goofey doing some of the moves but once you do it a few times you get over that feeling.  The instructor is also one that will not annoy you as many do.  If you like dancing and you like a change from the norm then I would recommend this video to you!,1107820800,4,534,3.6491228070175437
1333748,3,B00003UC9X,"I read comments from other people and ordered this video with a great deal of anticipation.  Jury is still out for me.  So far it doesn't appear that my hips and shoulders move this way and I am spending so much time trying to keep up and get the moves that I don't get a good workout.  I am keeping the tape and will give it a couple more chances.  The instructor is very charismatic and all of her ""team mates"" are in great shape.  If you like to dance and have some rythm, you should get this tape.  As a pudgy, short, non-dancer, I am thinking I might be out of my league here.",1099526400,5,581,4.008695652173913
1333749,5,B00003UC9X,"I know there are flaws in this video, but to me, they are minor.  I really liked this video!  Yes, it is a bit challanging, and yes, there is a bit of confusion, but after you watch it a time or two you can get the hang of it!  I didn't have the same problem that one viewer did when the instructor demonstrated a new move while her dancers did another.  You just keep following the background dancers while she is demonstrating the new move and then she incorporates it into the next set.  This was so fun to me that I was willing to look over the fact that it could have been more polished.  The drums are great, and if you can't do some of the exercises you can improvise until you are ready to do them - I have!  It's just nice to take a break from some of your run of the mill exercise tapes and have a little fun with dance!  I have knee difficulties and found that this did not bother me.  The heel chugs(sp?) might be a challange, but I just don't do as pronounced a move.",1089244800,8,980,4.010309278350515
1333750,3,B00003UC9X,"This video I would say is fair.  It has its good points, but at the same time, it really has its bad points.  What I really liked about it was that it is vert engaging.  It has always been hard for me to find a workout video that will motivate me and entertain me. I get bored and fed up with the people of excercise videos easily.  However, this is one that keeps you focussed and motivated, and the genuine charm of the afro-brazilian style of dance is enchantingly motivating too.  It hooks you in right from the start with the first workout.  However, the first workout is the only decent workout of the three. I was left excited to see the 2nd and 3rd workouts take off and get harder, but they didn't get harder at all; they got annoyingly easier.  To add to the confusion, Beth Lane gave two differnt dance moves the same name in differnt workouts.  That's quite confusing and annoying.  In addition, there is a specific scene where Beth totally messes up, and they keep it in.  She's doing the move wrong, and you can see the background dancers confused, messing up, and trying to match her. She messes instructions up later in the video too, and confuses the dancers again. This video isn't even live!  All in all, I'd say that it's a poorly put together production.  It's confusing, and it isn't challenging.  However, it's still reasonably fun to do, and you're more likely to stick with becuase of the charm of afro-brazillian dance.  So I would reccomend this if it's more important that you move for a long period of time instead of getting a good workout. Otherwise, this would not be a great choice.",1079222400,16,1615,4.486301369863014
1333769,4,B00003UC9X,"This DVD does not pretend to try to make you an expert at Afro-Brazilian dance, and that's a good thing, because it won't. But it is definitely inspired by that dance style, and takes moves directly from Afro-Brazilian dance and weaves them into a dance that you can do with a smile on your face.
Each of the three segments on this workout are short, which is good if you don't have a lot of time, and can be strung together, which is good if you do have a lot of time. I'm a fan of short, sweet workouts, and this has three good ones. Even in 15 minutes, it gets your heart going, but is gentle enough for a beginner.
The thing I love the most about this DVD is how it encourages you to use your whole body, to loosen up and feel the rhythm. There are moments, however, where a complicated move is not demonstrated very well (such as ""The Watussi""), and so you might get a little frustrated until you've practiced it a bit. There are also places that have some jumping, which is a little high-impact for those of us with knee problems (or who live on the second floor of apartment complexes with hardwood floors), and there's no modification given for these. I get around this by doing my own modifications to the moves, and have just as much fun.
If you don't mind not being ""perfect"" at the moves and want to have a lot of fun with a good, generally easy (but still invigorating) aerobic workout, this is the DVD for you.",1061510400,26,1424,4.277777777777778
1333770,3,B00003UC9X,This is a very good workout based on Afro-Brazilian steps. It has other steps in it to give a rounded full body workout. Very enjoyable. Buy this video first as a beginners video then move on to African Healing Dance video [....],1014249600,3,229,4.476190476190476
1333771,1,B00003UC9X,"I bought this video based on positive reviews here.  I've never before purchased a cardio / aerobic workout video so, before deciding this one was truly terrible, I watched (and used) the other new workout videos I had ordered.
This video is confusing, the instructor appears to be making it up as she goes along.  If you watch the other dancers behind her, they all seem confused as well.  I was initially interested because the workout is split into three shorter sessions.  This really appealed to me as I am often pushed for time.  Unfortunately, the workout is so light that one has to do all three to really get a decent sweat going.  My biggest problem, however, is the fact it is marketed as low impact.  You might never break a sweat but there are a few moves in the workout which I found downright painful.  I'm going to be selling my copy as soon as possible - and not to a friend!",1003363200,6,892,4.396341463414634
1333772,2,B00003UC9X,"I was excited to get this tape, looking forward to a fun and unique workout. Unfortunately, I found the video to be a disappointment, for the following reasons:
1. The moves are high-impact, but that's not how the video is marketed. Maybe if I was at a perfect weight and had younger knees, this wouldn't be an issue. But right now? Ouch.
2. The instructor often asks you to do the move demonstrated by the dancers behind her, while she demonstrates a new and different move. I thought my head was going to pop while I tried to learn a step completely different from what my feet were doing. 3. The cueing is *terrible*. The instructor even confuses the rest of the dancers on occasion. She uses different names (at times) for the same step. If you've done the video a number of times, it probably doesn't matter, but this made it that much harder to learn.
The good points of the video are:
1. Great drumming music.
2. Fun to watch.
3. Nice, colorful set.
For me, the cons outweighted the pros. Your mileage may vary.",1000857600,50,1018,4.449197860962567
1333773,5,B00003UC9X,"I bought this tape because it looked really fun and something I would stick to for more than a day.  And when I finally received it in the mail, I put it on because I just wanted to see what it was like, but I ended up following along in my work clothes because it IS really fun!  The instructor is easy going and funny which is very important because the last excercise video I had, the male instructor looked like a pervert and talked like one too.  The moves are not so difficult and the time just passes so quickly.  But the best part of the video was the real drummers providing just a beat to excercise to.  The first segment is actually the most trying and gets me sweating the most.  The second I feel is a little shorter.  And the third segment just feels like you're at a dance party.  And the great thing about it is, I haven't given up on it.  After 6 months of owning the video I still do it only 3 times a week (I'm not an excercise freak).",997228800,10,954,4.0588235294117645
1333774,5,B00003UC9X,"This is definitely the tape to own. It says it is low impact, but it is not at all! I was sweating like crazy and all my muscle groups were working. It was so muh fun too! I was smiling alot! The tape has great african inspired movements that can be done without taking up a lot of room. I did the tape in my bedroom and there was enough space. It is broken up into three sections. One workout alone will give you a great workout! I would like more of a cooldown at the end though, but besides that I say buy it!!",993254400,8,513,3.895238095238095
1333775,5,B00003UC9X,"First, I must say that this workout is a lot of fun to do especially when you do it with friends who usually run for their workout and are not used to following an instructor.  That said, this tape does not really feel like a workout, but by the end you are sweating quite a bit. You also don't need to have any background in dance to do this tape. You have the chance to learn all these cool Afro-Brazilian dance moves that come together to form a great aerobic workout. The tape is divided into three sections that get progressively harder, and it is fun to watch the back up dancers when they get a little too into the dance move.  All in all, a great workout and a nice change of pace with the rest of all the other workout videos that are out there.  My only complaint is that they don't have it on DVD yet.  And remember, you're really cooking now!!!",992822400,17,856,4.16969696969697
1333776,5,B00003UC9X,Beth Lane is DYNAMIC! She has great energy and style. I love doing the work-out. She makes you feel powerful! I enjoy this work-out because it's fun and great for cardio. I do it every morning and evening. The tape is a BLAST! You must try it. If you are trying to lose weight and hate to exercise. This work-out is for you. Because you work it hard dancing but you lose weight in the process. I LOVE THE TAPE!,976752000,4,410,4.1375
1333777,4,B00003UC9X,"This is such a great addition to my Method collection.  Beth Lane is wonderful to watch and makes you feel confident as you do the moves.  Lane  makes the routine and moves easy by encouraging you to watch her as she  does the moves.  The first time I put this baby in I was sweatting and I  felt a little silly doing the moves, but as I went through the routine and  watched everyone on the stage I got more confident and just went for it.  The background people are a nice addition and the drums bring this workout  together to make this my favorite Method dance tape. NOTE:  There is allot  of jumping and head movements in this workout, if you have neck and back  problems you will have to try to tone down the dance movements.",967593600,11,731,4.217391304347826
7919512,5,B00003UC9X,"Fun Video and easy to follow.  Two minor knocks.  I prefer videos where the narration is looped --i.e. the instructor is not trying to talk and dance at the same time.  Also Ms. Lane uses the term ""Watusi step"" for a few different dance moves.  She should have come up with a different name for each move.  Overall, I enjoy the DVD.",1458950400,,332,4.290322580645161

7919520,2,B00003UC9X,I wasn't a big fan of this video. She didn't explain what she was doing and she'd switch from one move to the other really quick. It's not much of a tutorial. Plus we felt super awkward doing it.,1310688000,,195,4.0256410256410255
7919521,5,B00003UC9X,"I bought this DVD a few months ago and like the other reviewers found it to be motivating.  The instructor, Beth Lane, has a great smile and is very motivating and encouraging. I spent a month just watching the video while doing only the ""Home Base"" moves! There are 3 different workouts of a little under 15 minutes each which makes this a nice cardio workout for when I am short of time.  Each workout includes warm up moves.  The class looks like they are having a lot of fun.  I like that Beth talked about the cultural aspects of the movements as she demonstrated them. The footwork on some of the movements was too challenging for me at first but because the drum music, the instructor and the students were entertaining, I didn't feel clumsy...just kept doing the ""home base"" steps.
