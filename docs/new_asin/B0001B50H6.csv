1985595,4,B0001B50H6,"I was familiar with Tasha Tudor's unusual way of life from reading her
children's books and other books and articles about her. I thought it would be a nice Christmas gift for certain friends and  relatives I thought would appreciate it. It shows Tudor at her home in an isolated area of the countryside, in Vermont I believe, in the Christmas season.
Her quaint home is very charming and very much of a different era. She
seems to be living a la the late 19th century. She dresses in an old fashioned sort of costume and goes about her chores with seeming vigor.
We see her readying for Christmas by making wreathes with local materials
and making gingerbread cookies and decorating a Christmas tree. She has
a fairly steady commentary going but there is also a voiceover describing
her lifestyle. She has some family over for a hearth roasted turkey dinner and later reads to grandchildren from her own illustrated edition
of ""T'was the night before Christmas."" Her Corgi dogs about whom she's
written charming stories flock about her. She milks her goats and shows off her beloved doves. There are many scenes featuring her antique dollhouse. It is a nostalgic and charming DVD that is ideal for quiet times in the Christmas season, and is such a contrast with all the noisy and commercial aspects of modern holiday celebrations.  I think all ages would like it. It would be a nice gift for older people. Those to whom I gave it really liked it and will watch it each Christmas I think.

1985598,5,B0001B50H6,"This is a beautiful movie, a glimpse into a time when Christmas was not the commercial blow-out that it is today. Instead, it focuses on the real things that count in life, handmade gifts which are really the gift of our time, the closenes of friends and family and special Christmas traditions...making the advent wreath,bringing in the tree,reading the Christmas story, special food for the animals who have the gift of speech on Christmas Eve, as well as cooking the feast.
