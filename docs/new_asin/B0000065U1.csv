1191528,5,B0000065U1,This movie portrays the rise of a far right folksinger who brings out the worst in the far left. If you can see the far right caricatures only you're going to miss half the point. The noble independent reporter who sees a truth that the mainstream media ignores. The intellectual host who refuses to share a stage while the folksinger sings. The Jewish American princess who angrily denounces Bob and nobody cares so she pulls plugs to stop the live broadcast.  It's a fine cast and really portrays our craziness well.,1475020800,,518,4.6923076923076925
1191529,5,B0000065U1,"I saw this in a movie theater when it first came out in 1992 and seemed a bit outlandish or cartoonish at the time.  I saw it again in via Amazon Prime September 2016 and, now, it seems all too realistic. As a mockumentary about a US Senate campaign set in Pennsylvania, it tells the tale of a shady folk singer/investor's rise to power. The humorous script and folk music performed by Tim Robbins deftly riff key elements of George Orwell's book ""1984.""  It also demonstrates how the media and many voters will unquestioningly support the political candidate who is most entertaining. The cast is made up of a lot of familiar faces and they handle the comedic material well.  Among the many actors who play roles as hair-helmeted local TV news anchors, James Spader gets my vote as the one who does the best and most subtle job showing how they are posturing tools of the media.",1474329600,4,879,4.550632911392405

1191548,3,B0000065U1,"Tim Robbins almost always brings something unexpected and interesting to his performances. This movie, though, he's a little less unexpected and interesting than usual -- or, at least that's the way it was headed for the first half hour. At that point I bailed. It's always a little dangerous, I think, for an actor with strongly held political views (and, by the way, my politics are pretty much the same as Mr. Robbins') to take a role that confirms them. The Bob Roberts character isn't really very interesting because he's less a fictional character than a pasteboard cutout. I know the movie's probably intended as satire, but if so who is the audience? Liberals like me may find it an exercise in flailing a dead horse. Conservatives will turn off in the first few minutes (is my guess) when they see where this is headed.

Besides, if you want some satire that really is surprising and hilarious, there's Trump....",1472774400,,921,4.7924528301886795

While Desert Storm was presented as a then current ""issue"" in this movie it had some indications of being the only military action by US forces since World War II and the Korean ""police action"" which had some justification as a result of Saddam Hussein using military equipment supplied by the US to fight the then common enemy Iran for the unagreed purpose of invading Kuwait and using American weapons to kill American soldiers.  Subsequent war in Iraq had every indication of being personal pique of the Bush crime family (whose Neill member bankrupted Silverado Savings & Loan in Denver Co and had a celebratory dinner scheduled with the parents of the attempted assassin of predecessor Ronny Raygun on the night that that assassination attempt occurred) while Afghanistan has been solely for maintaining the opium supplies of the sonofaBush's internationally expropriating of American propertty crony Prime Minister of the Untied Queendumb.  The ""national security"" referenced has included such felony abrogations of the US Constitution as homosexual molestation of all airline passengers in violation fo Article IV's prohibition of illegal searches, illegal seizure of all personal property such as stocks and bonds into the permanent adverse possession of the fraud and theft industry referenced as being ""Bob Roberts"" primary activity, infliction of object rape con dumbs on places of worship of hetero religion in violation of Article I's pretense of freedom to practice religion (other than the felony tax evading, slave mongering, hate mongering Xian fraudocracy), criminal theft of the entirety of the rightful incomes of elderly interest income dependent retired under the Islamic Terrorist Sh'ria pogroms of the Frauderal Reserve Bored, and numerous other crimes against we the people in violation of our Constitution.

A mockumentary about a Trojan horse candidate for a high political office that lays out a blueprint for getting elected... if you don't care what means you use. Tim Robbins is chillingly perfect as boyish, charming Bob Roberts. Alan Rickman is... Alan Rickman, enough said. An early performance from Jack Black gave me goosebumps. Cameos galore. Folk songs. A decided left wing slant, but that's another plus for me and shouldn't surprise anyone who's familiar with Robbins's politics. Highly recommended.",1472169600,2,639,5.153846153846154

1191564,5,B0000065U1,"I have never written a review before, but I had to on this one. . . The 2016 election is a couple months away, this movie came out in 1992, and it is the perfect example of everything that is still so wrong with our broken political system. . .  I listened to a lot of bob Dylan in my twenties, and I always felt that songs like ""masters of war"" or ""the times they are a changing"" or ""blowing in the wind"" or ""with god on our side"" and so many others could just as easily be about the bush administration and our occupation of Iraq as they were about Vietnam, etc. . .  this movie gives me that same feeling.  I would call it prophetic but it really is just able to see reality for what it is and call out all the fake electioneering puppet show that we all like to pretend is actually democracy. . . I know that this film is more clearly biased toward the left than it is to the right, and I know that Time Robbins is a Bernie supporter and he wrote the movie . . . but depending on your perspective, I think this is an indictment of Clinton style corruption (using charity as a front for doing arms deals with dictators) just as much as it is an indictment of Trump style populism (getting people to worship a man just because he is rich and entertaining when he really has nothing constructive to offer the actual American people).  My guess is that a lot of Clinton supporters will watch this movie and enjoy it and see it as a very prophetic attack on people like Trump, and it is. . . But I also see it as just a very clear acknowledgement that back room deals for the sake of corporate profit have defined our hopelessly binary political process for a long time.  This movie is definitely very preachy, but by the end of it I felt like it definitely earned that right, because everything they were expressing through this movie in 1992 is exactly what needs to be expressed now in 2016.  Please watch this movie, whichever side of the political spectrum you are on, because neither side has ever really represented the actual American people.  Also it has a young jack black and Gus from Breaking Bad in it.  Excellent movie.  I remember almost watching it around 2008 (the blockbuster days) but then rented something else instead . . . In retrospect I am glad I did not watch it then because right now, this election cycle, is the perfect time. . . . it provides much needed perspective.",1471910400,6,2395,4.280973451327434

While having a distinct political point of view that tilts left, at times extreme left, what it deftly, if not intentionally, depicts is the divide between right and left, as if we live in an alien nation. Soundtrack is superb; so good, in fact, that Tim Robbins refused to release a soundtrack album because his songs could be anthems for the right.

1191590,4,B0000065U1,"Made in the wake of the first Gulf War of 1991, BOB ROBERTS takes a satirical look at the senatorial race involving the eponymous hero of the title (played by Tim Robbins) and his Democratic rival (Gore Vidal).  Vidal stands for social justice, government aid for the needy, and communal values; Robbins for individualism, greed and social exploitation.  The film's major gimmick shows Robbins/ Roberts adopting the strategies of social protest to communicate his political message: folk-songs with easy-to-remember lyrics. The film contains some luscious performances: Robbins is particularly sinister as the squeaky-clean senatorial candidate trying to mask a shady past, aided and abetted by a wolfish Alan Rickman as a Bible-bashing exploiter.  The film seems even more sinister now than it did on its first release, in the wake of the Tea Party movement, which adopts many of the campaigning tactics Roberts finds so amenable.  To be honest, BOB ROBERTS runs out of steam towards the end: Vidal steps out of character to deliver his views of the American government and its obsession with 'National Security' direct to camera, while the political chicanery becomes a little repetitive.  Nonetheless the film is both chilling yet very funny, parodying the cliched language associated with electioneering.",1363392000,,1308,5.392156862745098

1191603,3,B0000065U1,"Still weirdly prescient as it approaches its 20th Anniversary, Tim Robbins' ""Bob Roberts"" is a mockumentary that skews the far right with a very thick blade. Robbins (who wrote the script, directed and co-wrote the music with his brother) plays Roberts, a smug phony of a candidate running for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania. He's savvy, smart, plays a mean guitar and isn't above a slew of dirty tricks. His hapless opponent, Senator Brickley Paiste (played to perfection by Gore Vidal), is an over inflated relic who can't keep up with the sneaky slickness of Roberts.

Filmed in a documentary style, the cameras love ""Roberts,"" who seems to have come from a parallel universe where Pete Seeger or Bob Dylan fought against the unions and war protestors instead of with them. Roberts tries to come off as a homey good old boy, when in reality he is a self-made millionaire who has turned his campaign bus into a stock-brokerage on wheels and alludes to making his money on insider trades. At night, he doubles as a singer whose hits blast welfare mothers and those who ""complain and complain and complain."" He's backed by a shady ex-special forces money man (Alan Rickman, sharp as ever in a mix of Dick Cheney and Oliver North) and Fred Ward as a snake-oil slinging campaign manager.

Only a small lefty newspaper reporter, (Giancarlo Esposito from Do The Right Thing) Bugs Raplin, seems to be onto Roberts' and the backroom dealing that went into Roberts' rise to power. This is where ""Bob Roberts"" jumps into the balck side of politics and away from the satire. But it does look like a Crystal Ball at some points, like when Roberts blows off a Philadelphia TV reporter who presses him for answers by asking her ""Are you a communist?"" Substitute ""Why do you hate America"" and the seen could have been scripted for any year between 2002 and 2007. Much of the movie runs the same course of events with different people (Karl Rove springs to mind).

""Bob Roberts"" is also interesting in the prolific cameos offered up. Helen Hunt and Susan Sarando both drop in, as does John Cusak as a pseudo-Saturday Night Live comic angered at a TV appearance for Roberts on their show. Country star Kelly Willis makes numerous appearances as Roberts' female duet partner. (The mock music videos are a hoot, too.) Best of the drop ins, a very young Jack Black as an obsessive Roberts junky. For a movie shot on a shoestring ($60,000) and even sold tickets to a ""Dinner With Bob Roberts"" to attract extras to a special scene, it looks wonderful.

The lack of a 4th star is due to the DVD transfer, which is scratchy and not as sharp as it could have been. Otherwise, ""Bob Roberts"" is on a par with other modern poli-satires as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wag-the-Dog/dp/0780622561/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wag the Dog</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bulworth/dp/6305297142/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bulworth</a>.",1234828800,3,3002,5.170781893004115
1191604,5,B0000065U1,"""Bob Roberts"" is a mockumentary about the senatorial campaign of a rich folk singer with a set of right-wing beliefs. Written, directed and starring Tim Robbins, who is well known for his left-wing views, this film cleverly satirizes right-wing politics and politicians (and the music of Bob Dylan). I suspect that how people react to this film will largely depend on their own personal beliefs. My beliefs lie somewhere between those of Robbins and his alter ego. I think that few people would have beliefs as far right as those of Bob Roberts, myself included, which makes it possible to laugh at Roberts' views, but at the same time I don't entirely agree with all of the things said by the left wing characters in this film, such as Roberts's senatorial rival (played by Gore Vidal), which are presumably close to Robbins' own views. Still, this is a well made, very funny and often disturbing film (with some really great songs), and regardless of what you believe, it is worth seeing if only to disagree with it (at the very least, it should make you think about who you would vote for if you were given the opportunity - Bob or his opponent).

1191605,4,B0000065U1,"A documentary filmmaker follows the campaign of folk singer-turned-senatorial candidate Bob Roberts (Tim Robbins).  Roberts is ultra-conservative, espousing a return to pre-hippie values and saying it's okay to be rich and successful.  His crazed fans idolize the flag-waving Bible-thumper but there's one man who casts aspersions on him:  Small-time journalist Bugs Raplin (Giancarlo Esposito) claims he has evidence Roberts is involved with shading dealings, and Roberts' handlers don't like that one bit.

Tim Robbins wrote and directed this mockumentary, filmed in shaky-cam.  It races from one campaign scene to another, painting a picture of a wholesome, inspired candidate who is above reproach - but if you know Robbins, you know it's all done sarcastically and in fact, shows Roberts to be a slick, prepackaged, underhanded liar at best and a law-breaking criminal at worst.

This film makes right-wing politicians out to be nasty and even dangerous hypocrites, so how much you'll like it depends pretty much on your own political slant.  For me, it was okay, 3.5 stars. Bottom line:  It's a good movie to watch during this election year.",1202428800,3,1147,5.333333333333333

It is echo chamber entertainment meant only for the already committed leftist. Needless to point out, this is not exactly surprising. Tim Robbins, after all, who starred, directed, and even sang in the  film is one of Hollywood's best know radical personalities. To be blunt, he is a less talented Oliver Stone. The script turns conservatives into cartoon characters. There is no attempt whatsoever to try understanding their world view. They are simplistically portrayed as fascists seeking any excuse to justify taking over the country. Bob Roberts (Tim Robbins) is a Republican U.S. senatorial candidate hoping to defeat incumbent Pennsylvanian Democrat Brickley Paiste (Gore Vidal). He is vile and not above using dirty tricks to achieve his aims. As the story unfolds, Roberts is well behind in the polls. A leftist journalist portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito tries to further derail Roberts' campaign by revealing his drug running and other criminal activities. Will he be successful? Can a journalist representing a small left-wing publication take down the rich and powerful? You will not be glued to your seat due to the suspense, but the story line isn't a complete bore. If nothing else, you will see countless well known motion picture stars come and go throughout the story.

Did you ever wonder why the far-left became unglued over the Iraqi liberation of 2003? Well, Bob Roberts should help enlighten you. It makes numerous references to Desert Storm, our first invasion of Iraq in 1991. The conflict was allegedly a conspiracy concocted by the devious right-wing ""National Security Council."" This group really runs the country, and not our elected leaders. The Republican administration of George Bush 41 only wanted to dominate the region. Our greedy military-industrial complex had to be satisfied, and would not take no for an answer. Saddam Hussein was not another Adolph Hitler---but a minor league dictator. Senator Brickley Paiste dismisses him as merely another member of ""the villain of the month club.""

Look at how the character used catchy songs and the right buzzwords to manipulate his followers and the media. It's what all of our major candidates (Dem. and Rep.) are guilty of. The major theme of this movie is thus: If we want better candidates, we have to pay better attention. The movie definately more than makes the case for that.",1104192000,13,677,4.380952380952381

1191639,4,B0000065U1,"By 1992, actor and leftist-liberal firebrand Tim Robbins had come a long way since his thankless role in the George Lucas uber-flop ""Howard the Duck"", and ""Bob Roberts"" displayed that the actor who had turned in fine performances in gritty movies like ""The Player"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", and---erm---""Erik the Viking"" (he played Erik, and *I* liked it, anyway) had solid directorial chops, as well.
""Bob Roberts"" is a gimlet-eyed little mockumentary chronicling the rise, fall and rise of merciless, villainous, Machiavellian and media-savvy politician Bob Roberts, who---as the film's opening sequence makes clear---is a man of many talents: former West Pointer, Wall Street trader and stock market guru, self-made millionaire, and right-wing folk singer.
Folk singer?
That's the clever little hook on which Robbins hangs his skillful little fusillade against mindless political partisanship: Roberts has appropriated the Rebel Prophet image crafted at Woodstock for himself, and---horrors!---for right-wing Republican politics. Roberts is an ingenious political animal, having picked up a guitar and made the transition from Woodstock to Wall Street---and now he wants Main Street.
The plot is simplicity itself: ""Bob Roberts"" is played with a straight face as the'documentary' of the 1992 Bob Roberts Pennsylvania senatorial campaign, produced and 'directed' by fictional documentarian Terry Manchester (played convincingly by veteran British actor Brian Murray).
Robbins, along with cinematographer Jean LePine (who worked with Robbins on ""The Player), has captured the documentary feel---and shows a flair for music videos as well; the Roberts remake of an old Bob Dylan video (entitled ""Wall Street Rap"") is one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and continues Roberts's plunder of leftist icons: the last cue-cards Roberts tosses into the street read:
""Make...Money...by..any...Means...Necessary"".
Robbins keeps up a taut and feverish MTV-like pace, charting Roberts's professional and political ride through interviews with parents, teachers, and friends, splicing them together with television appearances, interviews aboard the Roberts campaign bus (which doubles as a fully functional stock trading floor), and sequences from Roberts's folk concerts, where the candidate takes up his guitar and comes across as what might have happened had someone spliced Bob Dylan's genes with those of Rush Limbaugh.
That said, Robbins keeps the fun, intrigue, and political chicanery at a boil, and ""Bob Roberts"" is studded with famous faces all pulling off solid performances: Gore Vidal as the calcified liberal opponent, a young Jack Black as Bob's Number One Fan, Giancarlo Esposito as the tireless independent reporter digging for the truth, Alan Rickman as a scowling campaign supporter (and Black Ops mastermind) in dark glasses, Ray Wise as the gung-ho campaign manager, and Susan Sarandon, Fred Ward, and James Spader as clueless (and absolutely hysterical!) network TV anchors round out the C-SPAN-fueled goodness. <B
""Bob Roberts"" occasionally stumbles: the sequence on the comedy-show ""Cutting Edge"" is just painful, and comes across as sour and false.
But that's a small complaint for the best 'mockumentary' since ""This is Spinal Tap"", and it's a nice antidote to the deadly serious, nasty real-life politics of our own combative age. Now if they'd just release the soundtrack...",1066003200,11,3391,5.6903353057199215

1191641,3,B0000065U1,"Much to my consternation, many celebrity friends of Tim Robbins (Bob Roberts) and Susan Sarandon (Tawna Titan) were very vocal in their disapproval of the recent Iraqi engagement.  They did this for free using their celebrity-access to the press to expound personal views.  Ten years ago they were getting paid (I assume) to film this heavy-handed, although thought-provoking to be sure, political message under the guise of satire to attain the same goal.  I purchased this film 'used' for one-cent, thereby purposefully not helping their cause.  Hey, even the non-famous can make a statement.
'Bob Roberts', presented as a documentary, was their attempt to reveal to an uneducated populous just how easy it is for a corrupt right-wing candidate to mislead the unsuspecting voter by playing on the voter's emotions and by making use of the great 'political machine' and the press.  Make no mistake, the group of liberals responsible for this film truly believe the conservative-right is naive and totally not paying attention.  Ergo, 'Bob Roberts'.  I am guessing they weren't entirely successful, given the limited popularity of the film.  However, by sheer accident they succeeded on several unintended levels.
The film is entertaining and revealing, as well as frightening.  It is possible for a conservative to view the points of the 'other side' without being brainwashed, but without question the public can be mislead by politicians and the government.  But be aware and beware, this talent of misdirection is not restricted to conservative politicians.  Liberal politicians are masters at manipulation as well.  Voters of both parties need to be informed - period.
Every young actor in the film, (in addition to Robbins we see; James Spader, Peter Gallagher, Ray Wise, John Cusack, and many, many others, as there are more cameos in this film than you'll find in any jewelry case) presumably appearing to disclose and support their personal political stance by association, resembles a liberal politician in their physical appearance (some young Kennedy to be exact) much more than any conservative.  Thereby proving actors are NOT wolves in sheep's clothing, just wolves in wolves' clothing.
Fanatics are fanatical regardless of their views.  Giancarlo Esposito (Bugs Raplin,) the lone reporter bucking the tide of Roberts' over-blown patriotism, finally relates all his 'facts' in the same maniacal manner as any other whistle-blower.  Whether the information one is endeavoring to disseminate is true or false, one is better served to retain some semblance of sanity when to trying to inform.  I think they missed their mark a bit here; their personal intent would have been better served if this character had been a little less over-the-top.
I happened upon this film in an effort to view the entire work of Alan Rickman.  While I was already knowledgeable about the political views of most of the cast, Rickman has done a much better job (to his credit) in keeping his personal political views to himself.  In any event, Alan (Lukas Hart III), consummate actor that he is, gives his usual top-notch, right-on-the-nose, flawless performance.  Like most of us, he looked hotter than ever 10 years ago (though he is nothing less than gorgeous to behold even now).  The voice, the bearing, the talent are all there intact and serving to make him stand out in this cast of ho-hum talent even more than he normally does.  The vehicle is just not important when Alan appears on the screen.  I could watch Rickman buy groceries and be mesmerized.
Search amazon.com for a used copy of this video (I feel safe saying this, because they do not show they are selling new copies) and be entertained while you watch the lengths individuals will go to make a point.  While you are about it; count the cameos, make note of who is on what side (if that is important to you), and most of all - behold Alan Rickman, master actor, ply his trade.

The songs sung by candidate Roberts in the movie would likely not be taken for the satire they are and instead be adopted whole-cloth by many in 2003 America (which is why Robbins never released a movie soundtrack of ""Bob Roberts"").

1191670,5,B0000065U1,"How do you give a film more than five stars?  For ""Bob Roberts"" is the best, bar none, film about politics andpower in the United States.  It is entertaining; it is enlightening; it is an amusing, satirical romp that time has not rendered out-of-date.  Indeed, ten years after its release, it is more timely than ever.

This is due in part to Tim Robbins' deft talent for poking all sorts of holes in the balloons of the sanctimonious prigs who comprise the right wing of the nation's political spectrum.  But, above all, it is due to the presence in the film of our greatest living writer and man of letters, Gore Vidal.

Vidal's portrayal of incumbant senator Brickley Paste (D-PA), under siege from a folk-singing ""rebel"" Neanderthal (of course, Bob Roberts), is pointed, ironic and above all else educational.  For in his regretably short time on the screen, Vidal lays open for us his view of recent American history, all in that tired but wise man of the world way he has of stating truths that no one else (save people like Christopher Hitchens) has the guts to say.

""Bob Roberts"" is ultimately a film that brings us beneath the surface of American politics; and for this reason I suspect that it will never become as popular as other great political films, such as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Last Hurrah.""  For these are the films that depict politics as we would like it to be (""Mr. Smith"") or at least as we can tolerate it to be ("" The Last Hurrah"").  They do not however depict politics as it has become.  In this respect, ""Bob Roberts"" is the perfect sequel to ""The Last Hurrah;"" but the substance of its message is so painful that only the most ardently committed to civil liberties and a republican (small ""r"")form of government can bear

1191672,4,B0000065U1,".
In this pseudo-documentary (think ""This Is Spinal Tap""), Tim Robbins plays a Republican candidate for the U.S. senate.  Bob Roberts doesn't suggest platforms or programs, so much as just express feelings.  And, because he's a folk singer of conservative songs (such as ""The Times Are Changin' Back""), he doesn't give speeches -- at any time -- so much as sing songs in political concerts.  So his candidacy is largely sheltered from close scrutiny.  Despite the time period being an era when incumbents almost always win, Roberts makes it close against his Democratic incumbent opponent, played by Gore Vidal.  Vidal's character is hampered by allegations, and the whole thing is a funny, ironic roller coaster.
In his screenplay, Robbins introduces hard questions about political corruption, the military industry, and the demonizing of world leaders in order to support military funding.  Today, this is reminiscent of President Bush's ""axes of evil"" declaration, and the politics may anger some (especially since Saddam Hussein is repeatedly shown as the Evil of the Day).  But if you can set that aside, I think you can enjoy this political satire for all that it accomplishes.
A special treat is the myriad actors who float by the screen - - you'll have a lot of fun there, just as you might have enjoyed in ""This Is Spinal Tap.""  In addition to all those who are in the credits (and the list is long!), I think I -also- saw Broadway actor Chip Zein (the Baker from the original ""Into The Woods"") with a brief line in a crowd scene towards the end.  But there are perhaps a good dozen others you'll recognize from other movies (I was about to list them, but stopped in order to maintain some surprise for you).
My one reservation, and it's considerable, is that I think the sound needs to be re-mixed.  A number of funny side conversations are lost, and you need to skip back and crank up the volume.  This, of course, breaks up the continuity.

1191673,5,B0000065U1,"Bob Roberts is the fictional documentary about an ultra-conservative folk-singer (I can't figure that one either!) who decides to run for Senate in 1990.  Obviousley this movie is not supposed to show what politicians and campaigns are REALLY like (so calm down people!).  It exagerates the qualities of politicians and voters to prove a point.
...this movie not only makes a mockery of the ultra-conservative agenda, but it also is a slap in the face of you all -- the voting public.  Bob Roberts is clearly a sleazy, shallow, and deceptive character, but the public cannot seem to see past him on the surface level.  Theycontinue sporting their red, white, and blue colors while mindlessly humming his comicly absurd folk tunes.
While it IS grossly exagerated, Bob Roberts does suggest some REAL trends in American politics, conservative and liberal.  Robert's appearance on the Saturday night entertainment show (meant to represent SNL) is no doubt a reference to Clinton's appearance on Arseneo Hall during his  1992 campaign.  It suggests that the American Political Scene is being dumbed down SO much that it needs to appeal to the segments of society where image is more important than the real world (we also saw this in the debate between Roberts and Paisley).  Definately, Bush II's appearance on Oprah (and immediate jump in the polls) is a recent example of this ""dumbing down.""
I am very liberal, but I don't like this movie because is trashes the GOP.  It trashes the trend in American politics, and the mindless ignorant American public that is complicit in that trend.
I recommend Bob Roberts both for its humor AND its message.  I'm just dissapointed that Robbins refused to issue a soundtrack to this movie.  I was looking forward to purchasing these tunes and listening to them anytime I needed a good laugh!",1020816000,4,1827,4.9573770491803275
1191674,4,B0000065U1,"Suddenly, in the increasingly right-of-center autumn of 2001, this 1992 film seems timely all over again. In it, Tim Robbins plays a folk-singing uber-conservative Senatorial candidate (?!?!), running in Pennsylvania. The film follows his campaign's completely successful efforts to cajole, seduce, and flat-out dupe the media into slavishly following his every move. He gets ten times the coverage, as a ""media phenomenon,"" as he might have as a simple candidate. His followers love him as though he were a rock star.
Sadly, we may never know whether writer/director/star Tim Robbins consulted the Psychic Friends Network to get the idea for his film. No, wait -- he's still alive. I'll have to ask him about it. Be that as it may, the fact is that two years after the film, in 1994, the Republicans steamrolled their way into Congress fueled by rhetoric that, as often as not, could have been direct quotes from this film... Some of the political issues raised are dated now, such as the savings and loans scandals and the contras. Nevertheless, the basic spirit of an arch-conservative remains the same today, and comes through very clearly. I was bothered by the total vacuousness of Bob's supporters (actually, ""disciples"" might be a better word), who generally seem to come from less monied, less educated families than the supporters of Bob's opponent. Bob's supporters love him because he's a self-made rich man and he's not ashamed of it... it's true, it is all too easy to dismiss money as unimportant when you have plenty of it. I think, in a nutshell, Bob Roberts' supporters in the film are people who think of America as a ""land of opportunity,"" not as a ""society."" After all -- many of our ancestors DID originally come here to get rich, which they could never do in most other lands. What his supporters miss is the absolute emptiness behind Bob Roberts' smile, and his arctic, ruthless willingness to do anything to get ahead and stay there. His supporters value hard work and success, which is fine, but they don't see that their idol values these things only insofar as they further his own insane dreams of glory.
Today, some of the humorous touches may seem a little obscure for younger audiences. For example -- when BR was made, in 1992, cell phones were much more unusual than today. The fact that Bob's staffers constantly monitor media and stock market information on cell phones is intended to satirize yuppy consultants of the time. Today, it would strike no one as odd that staffers do this. Also, a lot of the music videos for the conservative folk songs are spoofs of particular music videos from the late 80s and early 90s. Another comedic touch that younger audiences might miss, for different reasons, is the way Merilee Dale portrays Bob's wife Polly.  A pinker, more precious, perfect, beaming Republican daddy's girl one could never imagine. Watching this film, I imagined frequent catfights breaking out on the set between Dale and Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins' real-life partner and co-star in the film, who is an extremely vocal and opinionated ""feminist's feminist.""
This movie is a lot of fun, and it makes you think about things we should all worry about more. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it felt a little thin for some reason -- maybe it could have used one more subplot. Still absolutely worth owning, however, and seeing again and again. Two thumbs up.",1008720000,5,3422,4.859589041095891
1191675,3,B0000065U1,"This film left me ambiguous. It is clearly a thinly veiled piece of left-wing ... to help Clinton with his election&#8212;something ""The Contender"" was meant to do in year 2000&#8212;yet it was (1) quite cleverly done; (2) it offered insight in the nature of the American voter; and (3) it had an impressive cast.
The movie reminded me of an inverted version of ""The Triumph of the Will"" by Leni Riefenstahl, a 1934 documentary of the congress of the German National Socialist Workers' Party in Nuremberg. Tim Robbins had all the workings of ..., down to simple details like the extended-arm greeting. You are expected to become emotionally involved by showing aversion to the obviously bad guy, shed a tear when the news of the rogue reporter's death come in and, above all, you're expected to be angered with the political stance presented by Tim Robbins's character. It is possible that rhetoric students would have a field day studying this film, but maybe not&#8212;because it was intended to expose cliches, but it did so employing another, rather blatant cliche in itself. So let's just call it a case study for the beginning rhetoric and film student.
What is worrying though is that the events depicted in ""Bob Roberts"" rang very familiar. It was like watching the Bush vs Gore campaign all over again, except that the cinematic rendition was created nearly 10 years previously. Despite what actor-...-writer-...-director (in another word, ""auteur"") Robbins was implying so desperately, neither side seemed too convincing. I still reserve the right to view Brickley Paiste's economic policy as utter poppycock, yet it seemed bizarre for such a seemingly educated public that Americans claim to be to enter this frenzy of a zero-sum devotion to one candidate as a package deal. Have they no reason, or is it some Freudian search for a missing identity in the vast, homogenous crowd that the USA is? If it was just a parody, I wouldn't worry; yet the Charles Manson associations at times portrayed these excesses quite well.
Another thing that I found interesting was the appearance of some rather unexpected stars. For a smallish and forgotten film, complementing Tim Robbins (who did a better job as a dim-witted loser in ""Erik the Viking"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"") and Alan Rickman (""Galaxy Quest,"" ""Dogma"") were John Cusack, Bob Balaban (the small, funny-looking kinda guy from Woody Allen movies and ""Waiting for Guffman""), Helen Hunt as a minor reporter, Jack Black as the mental kid of the Mayor of Harrisburg, Susan Sarandon as news presenter, Jeremy Piven (""PCU,"" ""The Grifters,"" ""Kiss the Girls"")&#8212;basically, it was fun to look out for another familiar face in the many crowds featured on this imaginary campaign trail.
I'm giving ""Bob Roberts"" three stars because it carries a clear message of warning&#8212;and not of the hippie leftist type that Giancarlo Esposito's character was trying to convey. Even if this film doesn't call for reason, a cerebral viewer should be able to infer this, and it's even redundant for me to note that if indeed you are a cerebral viewer.",991008000,6,3096,5.025291828793774

I still think the film isn't as funny as it should be, and is too self-congratulatory by half. But perhaps Mr. Robbins deserves to indulge in a little self-congratulation, for his political prescience is now obvious: George W. Bush IS Bob Roberts. Bush may not sing or play the guitar, but man, he sure plays to the camera--whether landing in a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier or serving fake turkey to the troops in Iraq--while dancing on our basic freedoms and international prestige with football cleats. Similarly, the sinister political adviser played by Alan Rickman now seems a perfect amalgam of Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft and others in the Rogues' Gallery of the Bush Administration. And though I found the zombie-like devotion of the followers of the cold, unappealing Roberts hard to believe, it's no less believable than the fealty that millions of voters swear to Bush. Robbins' spring 2003 speech before the National Press Club--which he made in the wake of being disinvited to the 15th-anniversary celebration of ""Bull Durham"" because of his stand against the Iraq war--is a brilliant political document, and one that underlines the culmination of many of the dangers Robbins warned against in ""Bob Roberts.""

I'm unsure if Robbins meant for the film imply that there was such a great linkage, but, considering its very political nature, I must suspect he does feel that there is truth behind his fictional accusations.

Pennebaker's 1966 documentary ""Don't  Look Back"" (which covered Bob Dylan's 1965 U.K. tour; a number of  scenes in ""Bob Roberts"" are cribbed directly from the Pennebaker  film), ""Bob Roberts"" follows the title character (played by  Robbins, who also directs and writes here) in his 1990 Senatorial campaign  against Brickley Paiste, a once-vigorous, but now-weary and increasingly  disenchanted New Frontier-era liberal democrat (played by author Gore  Vidal).  Roberts, who had made a fortune on Wall Street during  the '80s, first gains national attention in the late '80s with a pair of  critically panned, but commercially successful albums (clever homages to  two early '60s Dylan albums) of right-wing country-folk songs. Using his  musical fame as a springboard, Roberts embarks on his political career,  backed by press aide Chet MacGregor (Ray Wise) and the shadowy Lukas Hart  III (Alan Rickman, whose Mephistophelean presence almost steals the movie).  Along the way, Roberts is tailed by journalist Bugs Raplin (Giancarlo  Esposito), who is eventually framed for an assassination attempt on Roberts  when he gets too close to uncovering Hart's and Roberts' shady involvement  in both the Iran-Contra and S&L debacles of the '80s.  Largely  viewed at the time of its release as a broad slap at the New Right, in  retrospect Robbins is nearly as critical of the Old Left. Vidal's Brickley  Paiste is old, tired, and nearly irrelevant (and, sadly, seems to know it).  If Robbins is scathing in his indictment of the Right, Paiste symbolizes  Robbins' criticism of the Left for their lack of energy and ideas. Given  the kind of pasting Democrats received in the '94 election, more of them  would have done well to pay attention to Robbins' uncannily prescient  warning.  Cameos abound. Watch for the likes of Susan Sarandon, Helen  Hunt, and others as reporters, as well as country singer Kelly Willis as  Joan Baez to Robbins' Dylan.  One final note: In a perfect example of  life imitating art once again, ""Bob Roberts"" neatly foreshadowed  R.J. Cutler and David Van Taylor's ""A Perfect Candidate,"" a 1996  documentary of Oliver North's 1994 Virginia Senate campaign. Ironically,  Cutler had been invited by North's handlers to film the campaign because  they had liked his earlier documentary, ""The War Room,"" on which  Cutler had worked with - you guessed it - D.A. Pennebaker. Watch all three  in chronological order someday if you have the time.",967420800,47,2617,5.24455205811138
1191712,1,B0000065U1,"The basic idea behind this movie is that anyone who is to the right of Tim Robbins politically is a hypocritical fraud.  He creates a group of characters who embody the left's worst stereotypes of Conservatives and  then proceeds to let us know what awful people they are .  It's the kind of  thoughtless agitprop that can only come from someone who's never actually  met a Republican.
If you've ever had a political discussion that was  more nuanced than a lite beer commercial, this movie will leave you cold.",953942400,17,511,4.685393258426966

Even a nod to  Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Who knows what Bob Roberts stands for?  Who cares?  All  anyone need know is that he is the ""conservative rebel""  (""passionate conservative""?/""reformer w/results""?) who  strums on the guitar to political ""folk"" songs with great aplomb  and mass commercial appeal. A good reminder of how shallow our democracy  has become, and the handholding that is evident amongst big business,  media, and government.  Yea for tim robbins!",951782400,11,715,5.4495412844036695

1191715,4,B0000065U1,This movie is for those of us who like politics and can enjoy a good laugh at its expense.  Each candidate in some ways manipulates the media and Bob Roberts is a guy who pulls out all the stops and never quits manipulating  the press.  His stunts are far out there...or are they?  and hysterical all  at once.  A must see!,947203200,4,323,4.213114754098361
1191716,5,B0000065U1,"We were all told to interpret BOB ROBERTS as another ""faux documentary,"" in the vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP, but believe me when I say that it should be shelved in the horror section.  I'm a huge fan of THE  EXORCIST and the original HALLOWEEN, but BOB ROBERTS did more to instill a  sense of utter dread in my soul than Friedkin's and Carpenter's opera  combined.
Robbins is simply brilliant in the title role -- that of an  ultra-right-wing senatorial candidate who tours his home state of  Pennsylvania in a bus called ""The Pride,"" accompanied by a  politically-correct mix of minority and female staff members, grabbing  every conceiveable opportunity to manipulate the press and forward his  campaign.  Robbins imbues the role with the kind of doubletalk and charm  and slippery charisma that, whether we realize it or not, drives the entire  political candidacy system.  That it takes us a little time to stop smiling  back at him and get truly disgusted is testament to the need for this  film.
Perhaps the most chilling element of BOB ROBERTS is the constant  silencing and/or nullification of any and all sane voices that dare to  oppose Roberts and what he stands for.  In a segment where Roberts -- whose  fairly ingenious attempt to usurp the ""freewheeling"" image of Bob  Dylan requires him to record and release several folk albums -- becomes the  musical guest on an episode of ""Cutting Edge Live"" (a blatant  reference to ""Saturday Night Live,"" the program where the  character of Bob Roberts made his debut during an episode hosted by  Robbins), the objections of both the guest host (played by Robbins'  sometimes co-star John Cusack) and one of the producers to Roberts' very  presence on the show is undercut and overridden in short order by the  powers-that-be, who see nothing more than the ratings to be garnered by the  candidate's appearance, and nothing wrong with the ethical price being paid  for such a coup.
Competing with that sequence for most terrifying moment  is the initial depiction of Roberts' biggest fans, a triad of future KKK or  otherwise malefic militia members, average age twentyish, whose gazes are  as blank and fanatical as the robotic rhetoric that clearly drives them to  idolize -- and virtually drool in the presence of -- the grinning monster  who even himself is disturbed by the level of the boys' devotion.  The  reappearance of these same boys, late in the film, rivals the most  uncomfortable moments of ROSEMARY'S BABY for sheer revulsion at the abject  wrongness of the nature of their worship.
Robbins, the writer, producer,  and director as well as star of BOB ROBERTS, had the sense to refrain from  releasing a soundtrack album to this film, as the litany of nigh-satanic  folk songs (""Complain, Complain, Complain""; ""Don't  Vote""; etc.) would certainly, out of context, become an actual anthem  for precisely the kind of subhuman American consumers whom Robbins  viciously attacks throughout the film -- to me, solid proof that Robbins is  less interested in money than his message, proving even further that he is  indeed anti-Republican.
Get your hands on BOB ROBERTS.  Use it as a  litmus test for those around you whose political motives you doubt, or  flat-out know to be problematic.  If they clap along with the music and  don't understand why the fictional documentarian winds up criticizing his  own chosen subject, hand 'em some Klan literature and lose their phone  numbers.  The film is brash, courageous, important, and -- unfortunately --  timeless in this, the much-revered ""land of the free.""
Notable  supporting roles are filled by the likes of Peter Gallagher, Alan Rickman,  Helen Hunt, the remarkable Ray Wise (almost as scary here as he was in  ""Twin Peaks""), and the incomparable Gore Vidal (as Roberts'  besieged-by-press-manipulation Democratic opponent).
And one more thing:  watch the entire movie, all the way through the closing credits.  Robbins'  real message appears immediately thereafter.",929059200,33,3985,5.036923076923077
