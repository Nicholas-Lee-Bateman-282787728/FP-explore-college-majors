8086543,4,B000BGR0LK,"The 50 year history of America's two most popular muscle / sports cars in a single package (2 DVDs for nearly the same price as either one alone) Although most aficionados usually prefer one car to the other, they've both staked big claims in the American market. The Corvette has been a great sports car with world class handling and the Mustang, a great grand touring car with plenty of power and response plus back seats that can easily handle kids or small adults and a very usable trunk that takes full size airline check-in suitcases. Plenty of nostalgia for those of us than can remember back when these vehicles were first introduced and growing pains they persevered to become the cars they are today.",1440547200,,710,4.688
8086544,5,B000BGR0LK,"I sampled these exercise videos from my library and ended buying the whole package.  It is an excellent workout, especially for older woman.  It is simple, yet effective!  I actually enjoy doing these workouts!",1190937600,2,210,5.117647058823529
