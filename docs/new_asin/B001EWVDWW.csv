8362354,1,B001EWVDWW,"The cover looks pretty good, doesn't it?  That's the best part about these 2 tepidly horrible flicks.  Troma puts out Oscar winning material compared to this.  This was a one man show.  Literally.  If he could've pulled off being the women, he would've.  Exec Produced, Directed, Written, Edited, Starring, Lighting Director, Visual Effects, CG, Location Manager, Transportation & possibly even Caterer, was one guy.  Everyone in the first one also received Producer credits.  Amulets bring back the dead.  Re-incarnated enemies from ancient times.  I've seen 10 yr olds with better computer skills than what's seen here.  It brought to mind what the Little Rascals would've put on if they had a computer & acid laced pot & they were in their 30's, living in their parent's basement.  If this guy sold 25 copies, he made his money back.  I'm ashamed to have watched it, much less bought it.  When they made up sets (very rarely), they made costumes out of the same material.  The ""stone walls"" were painted on canvas.  Continuity people.  You should invest in one or at least take pictures of the actors with your mom's Polariod.  There might've been 4 people in both flicks that were in decent shape.  Camera adds 10 lbs so these people were huge.
Pt. 1.  Plot is ""let's make a porno in an abandoned house where someone could've died 3 years ago"" & ""ancient evil"".  Thankfully, everyone kept their clothes on.  Most of the producers & cast die.  ""Abandoned house"" has some insurance companies name on the door.
Pt. 2.  Takes up where the first ended but with different female lead.  (All of the male cast from the first are back save 1.)  More ancient evil fights.  Nazi Germany.  Really?  Because some friend of yours is taking it in community college?  Tons more CG work with green screen.  You need to clean that stuff up & make sure the actors & props don't get lost in it.
Horrible.  Horrible.  Not even get stoned with your friends good.",1275436800,13,1944,4.7074626865671645
