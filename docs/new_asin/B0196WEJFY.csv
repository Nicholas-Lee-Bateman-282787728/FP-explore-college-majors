passionate,emotionaly thought evoking,restless,and brutal. And for all the lucky ""chosen ones"" who have EVER been victimized in any way shape or form,it's ultimately a BRILLIANT and anti-socially gratifying film.
(Caveat:NOT for the faint at heart though).

~So watch OUT all you sicko wacko's out there,because in the end,perhaps YOU will eventually meet your very own proverbial ""DEMOLISHER"" inside of yourself.",1487289600,,440,6.213114754098361
7564781,1,B0196WEJFY,"This would be 0 stars if possible.  I love a good guilt-expiation or revenge film.  I am reluctant to name such as ""Lady Vengeance"" or ""Man On Fire"" in the same review as this god-awful waste of time and money.  Agonizingly slow, relying on pretentiously important non-verbal characters.  The person who edited the Trailer is to be congratulated for crafting a compelling Ad from this footage, getting me to buy it.",1483056000,4,415,4.802816901408451
7564782,1,B0196WEJFY,"Really don't understand where these 3 stars are coming from because this movie sucks. Very little dialogue, half the movie is spent with people walking around in slow motion, it's confusing...a complete waste of 90 minutes.

7564786,3,B0196WEJFY,"The Demolisher is a vigilante film in the style of Death Wish. The title character is an ordinary cable repairman, Bruce (Ry Barrett), who is tormented by a crippling sense of responsibility for his wife, Samantha (Tianna Nori), an ex-policewoman who was attacked by a vicious gang and left disabled physically and emotionally. Bruce takes care of her dutifully but at night, while shes asleep, he channels his sense of injustice into vigilantism, donning riot gear and taking to the streets to right the seemingly infinite number of wrongs committed each day. Bruce becomes The Demolisher, a one-man destructive force tearing through a city blighted by crime.

The film is strong on violence and visually striking. Director Gabriel Carrer portrays the late-night streets as the province of those who take advantage of the innocent. With deep shadows, rain-soaked sidewalks and strange noises, this is a frightening environment. The dialogue is spare; Bruce isn't a man of many words. Beyond the reason for his vigilante obsession, we learn little about Bruce or his wife. A subplot dominating the second half of the movie involves a young woman (Jessica Vano) who might lead to his wifes attackers.

Bonus extras on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes making-of featurette, filmmakers Q & A at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, and theatrical trailer.",1475712000,,1401,5.278026905829597
7564787,4,B0196WEJFY,"PLOT...
Bruce (Ry Barrett) is an ordinary repairman tormented by a crippling sense of responsibility for his disabled wife Samantha, an ex-policewoman (Tianna Nori), the survivor of a gang-related assault. Bruce's increasing hyper-sensitivity to the injustice suffered by his wife steer him down a dark path of vigilantism, and with his rapidly disintegrating mental health, paranoia and overwhelming sense of doom, Bruce channels his inner rage towards a young woman, Marie (Jessica Vano) and finds refuge in a world of extreme violence. Both a character study and a psychological examination of trauma, The Demolisher is an unapologetic portrayal of what can happen when a fragile mind is pushed too far.

This is a very stylish and cool looking movie from beginning to end, a very retro 80's vibe with the incredible synth like score and the typical revenge theme that was popular all the time in the 80's, the killers outfit and even the way he's portrayed walking about the streets unseen is such a great 80's throw back, for a low budget effort its a little gem that's sure to be cult classic, the cast is good, there is plenty of violence, not really graphically bloody but all good old-school looking, the whole movie is stylishly shot and lit and really sets such a refreshing mood compared to your usual cinematic big movies, not everyone will dig this movie but fans of old school 80's should find it a treat at least.

Running time 86-mins UNCUT, 2015.

My review is based on the German Steelbook version, Region code free, comes with CD soundtrack, postcards, poster.
English language, features include behind the scenes 9-mins, Q&A, music video. Also in English, removable subtitles.",1474329600,2,1697,5.01063829787234
7564788,2,B0196WEJFY,"Bruce (Ry Barrett) is a cable guy and vigilante. His wife (Tianna Nori) was a victim of violence and he spends his spare time caring for her when he is not in riot gear knocking in the heads of a gang called the ""Mandrills."" We see him a beat up a few of them, some victim group therapy and then we see Bruce go off a cliff as he goes after people that don't quite come up to the bad guy level.

The film was rather pointless as was Ry Barrett's character.

The only thing nice I can say about this is the gorgeous side boob of the 2 main female characters of which 1 I have no idea why she is even in this movie.

7564794,1,B0196WEJFY,"Wow. Painful. That's all I can say about this movie that has about 14 complete lines of dialogue and makes absolutely no sense.

I always like a good chase where the guy who walks never seems to be more than 2 seconds behind the marathon runner that has pretty much sprinted non stop for what seemed like eternity in this movie to only be punched in the head as she turned the corner.",1508025600,,384,4.260273972602739

8744207,2,B0196WEJFY,"Whatever this film aspired to, or thought it was....it isn't. It is a constant mesh of seemingly disjointed scenes that lead nowhere. It is not that the acting is bad, because it isn't. The actors do a decent job of creating and conveying emotion. It also is not because of the directing and camera work because that is also pretty good. The scenes, taken by themselves are pretty good, the problem is that they never connect. I appreciate the attempt to turn a ""revenge"" flick into something different than the average, but this completely failed..",1515628800,,549,4.7894736842105265
8744208,3,B0196WEJFY,"I guess I found this to be a much better movie than some.  Certainly it's no blockbuster and the plot is so ""Punisher"" (but even THAT'S not original).

Yes, it's dark.  Movies about revenge and death SHOULD be.  This isn't a thinking person's movie.  It's a platform for entertainment and I was entertained just enough to NOT call it a piece of rubbish.",1513728000,,353,4.5396825396825395
