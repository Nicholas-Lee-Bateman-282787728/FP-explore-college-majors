4211237,3,B003VSM4QQ,"Sounded like it might be an interesting film but as I continued to watch, I asked myself, ""Why am I watching this?""  While this woman manipulated others, I suppose she was manipulating me as well since I was still curious how this story would all end up.",1367193600,,254,4.404255319148936
4211238,2,B003VSM4QQ,"Easy enough to begain watching this tale of ""tragedy"". However when the film starts uncovering the inconsistency of events and timing of said honor killing, this woman goes quickly into overdrive with a abundance of falsehoods & deceptions.
 There is a special place for her in the eternity. If you watch this do yourself a favor and shut it down halfway, the lies are just non-stop!",1367107200,,383,4.803030303030303
4211239,5,B003VSM4QQ,"One cannot rule out that maybe Norma made a deal with authorities of some type to write this in exchange for getting off her charges.

This book, along with the tacky ""Not Without My Daughter"" by Betty Mahmoody, which equally outraged
Iranians around the world for the deprecating picture of their culture this suspicious autobiography painted,
served clear political motives to denigrate Middle Easterners. At a time when public support was being generated for 2 wars which had nothing really to do with America, but played the same card :
""Muslim women are oppressed so badly ; 'we' have to go rescue them"".
[Who are ""we"", anyway ?]

Maybe a quick minded Norma thought up this idea and proposed it to some government officials. If so that would answer the question posed above about why she was let off so easily after scheming to extract $500,000 from her --  ""like a grandmother to me"" she described her victim -- next door neighbor !
But I have traveled throughout the entire country of Jordan and none of the stereotypes Norma empoloyed rang true when I read her book, Honor Lost. I found Jordanian women to be intelligent, capable and highly dignified.
Not like the purported mother of Dalia who never intervenes to save her daughter.
Rather, the opposite : confident and decisive in their dealings with their relatives and especially husbands.
They know they have authority within the home and never fear to exercise that !

It was easy to snow a Western public brought up on trashy book after horror story after abominably false 'movie'.
But for people who actually know a bit about Jordanian and Arab and other Middle Eastern cultures, and especially was a guest in many homes, this was a ridiculous fraud concocted to rile up Westerners against Muslims.

One of the worst lies Norma CLEARLY made up, when all else failed her as an explanation for her atrocious behavior,
was that she was a victim of 'child abuse'. This is an American pet theme trotted out by so many today ; Norma simply jumped on that popular bandwagon. But in Jordan or any of the Middle Eastern countries all the way to South Asia, the very idea of attacking a daughter would NEVER occur to a father. It's preposterous. I feel sorry for the father, Majid, who was another of his daughter's victims. This is something that few Westerners would realize, maybe giving Norma the benefit of the doubt.
In fact, pathological liar is not a strong enough term for Norma. Maybe a narcissistic psychopath would fit her better.

Why does she so prominently display a silver cross around her neck, but never once speaks about God or praying or saying the Rosary ? These are the only help for her.

Speaking of religion, however, Norma manages to give a false impression about even that basic topic as revealed in the documentary where she says that she is ""Catholic - [quickly adds] - well, Orthodox"". In fact they are two different faiths, widely apart on certain points.
She used the word Catholic for both herself and her fictional hero, ""Michael"" to drum up sympathy from her American and Western audience, largely unfamiliar with the Greek or Syrian or Russian Orthodox Churches. My guess is that there are few Catholic men in the Jordanian Army, so the book had an improbable scenario from the start, on many counts.

Finally, the name Dalia is not very common ; right there that should have been a red flag. It sounds Western, like the flower dahlia.

Congratulations to the intrepid filmmaker for tracking this all down and portraying it vividly and creatively.
I agree with the other comment that it was surely the best documentary I can remember seeing.",1366934400,2,3633,4.763116057233704
4211240,5,B003VSM4QQ,"I will not go into many details and keep this write up short but I will say that you MUST see this film because it will surprise you many ways.  The gist of the story has to do with a book that was published in 2001 dealing with an honor killing in Jordan where the author of the book claimed the her childhood friend was murdered by her own family for having fallen in love with a Christian man.  The publishers of the book pretty much did nothing to verify the story and published it as nonfiction.  People in Jordan were incredibly offended and researched the story to find that there is no evidence to corroborate any of the things the author claims.  In other words, the murder never took place and the person she claims was killed never existed.

At this point we would think the author just pulled a fast one and gained some fame and fortune out of it.  However, the film maker here decided to get all sides of this story and interviews both the author and various people who exposed her lies.  We come to find the woman who wrote this book is a complete monster that has been involved in criminal activity such as theft, child abandonment, and just one con after another having ended up on the poor side of town and wanting more out of life.  She even takes the film maker to her Jordanian hometown and uses pathological lies to just waste time and frustrate the crew.  There is a candid segment of her speaking freely when she thinks the camera is off and her act is dropped; true colors show.

It is an excellent film in every way but my question is why the Chicago Police Department refuses to arrest her when she has had charges for theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars in securities from a safe deposit box pending for years.  Back in 2001 she was touring promoting the book and her whereabouts were well known yet law enforcement did nothing.",1365638400,,1861,4.380813953488372
4211241,5,B003VSM4QQ,"How much do we REALLY know anyone?!
It starts out with a woman trying to make aware the injustice of her best friend's unjust murder; then things begin to disintegrate rapidly.
You gotta watch this!",1363046400,4,198,4.685714285714286
4211242,5,B003VSM4QQ,"Perhaps the most interesting documentary I've ever seen.
Norma Khouri is truly a sociopath and the director takes us on a crazy journey.
A must see!",1351468800,2,148,4.730769230769231
4211243,4,B003VSM4QQ,"In 2003, Norma Khouri published ""Forbidden Love"" (""Honor Lost"" in the United States), a memoir of her childhood in Jordan and the brutal murder of her best friend Dalia, a young woman killed by her own father because she was dating a Christian man. This tragic story riveted readers around the world, was translated into 16 languages, and made Khouri a celebrity in the cause of eliminating ""honor killing"" in the Arab world. A year later, Malcolm Knox of Australia's Sydney Morning Herald exposed Khouri's book as a hoax that got almost every detail and cultural trait of Jordan wrong and invented the victim Dalia, who had inspired so much international outrage. Knox declared Khouri's book the first great literary hoax of the 21st century, though she would have to compete with James Frey, who was exposed about the same time in the US.

Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski, who admits to liking Norma Khouri, wanted to give the author every chance to prove that the story she wrote was true -or at least factually based. Khouri seems to have been game, though I suspect she participated in the film for the money and the free trip to Jordan. The first part of ""Forbidden Lies"" allows Khouri to tell Dalia's story and how she came to write about it. Then we learn about the accusations of fabrications from her critics, including Jordanian women's rights activists who asked Khouri's publishers to reclassify the book as fiction. Broinowski travels to Jordan with Khouri, film crew and ""bodyguard"" in tow, to uncover the truth. Rena Hasseini, a Jordanian journalist who specializes in honor crimes, first takes the filmmakers to locations around Amman to demonstrate that the story in the book could not have happened.

We watch as Khouri tries mightily to rationalize every fiction in the book as she is repeatedly confronted with evidence against her. This might be an interesting portrait of a pathological liar who, bizarrely, wants to make a show of her own defrocking. But ""Forbidden Love"" wasn't Norma Khouri's first con by a long shot. The deceitful webs this woman has woven just get bigger and bigger until the audience is dumbfounded. At some point, Khouri herself asks the camera why she would have done all the interviews and book tours if it had been a hoax. Good question. A desire for attention is a con artist's Achilles heel. But Khouri is not a typical con artist. Broinowski concludes that ""she's a kind of practical joker on a very big amoral scale"". That's charitable. But she knew how to cater to Western guilt and Western conceit about the Middle East, and she is not the only one.

The DVD (IndiePix 2012): There are deleted scenes, a trailer (2 min), a ""Director's Diary"" (13 min), which is a video diary of some points in making the film, ""Interviews with the Filmmakers"" (10 min), in which director Anna Broinowski and producer Sally Regan talk about the project and Khouri -this is very worthwhile. There are 4 short featurettes: ""About the Real Norma"" (5 min) are deleted scenes speculating on her motivation. ""Norma's Jordan"" (3 min) is a revealing scene taped by Norma in which she discusses conning Anna. ""Goose Chase"" (4 min) concerns some apparently faked medical records. ""The World of John T."" (8 min) are additional interviews with Khouri's husband. There is also, interestingly, an audio commentary with Anna Broinowski and Norma Khouri while she's seeing the film for the first time. It is friendly, but Khouri gets defensive and spins more tales.",1345680000,8,3492,4.89527027027027

8407081,4,B003VSM4QQ,I knew nothing about this controversy prior to picking up this documentary on a whim at my local library.  I can only conclude that Norma is a liar and most likely a sociopath.  She has told so many lies she seems to have convinced herself that they are all the truth and everyone else is lying.  When that course of action doesn't work she blames everyone for causing her to lie.  Then she tries to paint herself as a victim.  In the end she's just another liar who refuses to take any responsibility for her bad behavior.,1449532800,,523,4.350515463917525

8407083,4,B003VSM4QQ,"This is probably one of the best documentaries of all times. There is obviously no doubt that Norma Khouri is genius con artist. You almost admire her for doing it. It is scary to know that people like her exist. The publishing world learned a huge lesson from authors trying to sell their ""true stories."" At one point I was laughing during the documentary because her lies turned into this cat and mouse game with the director. This documentary is worth watching!",1419811200,,464,4.670731707317073
8407084,4,B003VSM4QQ,It was hard to tell who was the biggest con artist in this documentary: Norma Khouri or the filmmakers.,1405641600,,103,4.473684210526316
8407085,4,B003VSM4QQ,"It was really interesting. I couldn't look away from the crazy though, at times, it was awkward. Once, you get past the beginning, it's quite the rollercoaster.",1402099200,,160,4.962962962962963
8407086,5,B003VSM4QQ,"Really interesting documentary! It's like a suspense and a mystery, trying to figure out if she is or isn't lying about her book's story. I could see though why she wouldn't give the right name of the person she claims was honor killed.",1396569600,,236,4.511627906976744
8407087,3,B003VSM4QQ,"This film starts off intriguing enough, but eventually one is left wondering why waste any additional time listening to a pathological liar lie?  I think because we think we will eventually figure Norma Khouri out--figure out why she lies, why she wrote a fake memoir, why she even traveled to Jordon to prove her fake memoir wasn't fake.  Unfortunately, you won't figure her out from this film; unless you believe she did it for fame or money; or because she was sexually abused by her father and later abused by her husband; or a combination of those things.  The claims of abuse come at the very end of the documentary, at which time, one can only laugh; not because such possible abuse is funny, but because no one is going to believe anything she says by the end of the film. She might as well save it for her psychiatrist.

Norma Khouri lies all the time, one lie after another after another.  When presented with all the proof of her lies in her book, she claims she had to change all the names, dates and details to protect herself and her family.  When confronted with the fact she abandoned her two children, she claims she knows they can make it without her, but the women in Jordon cannot.  That seems to be one of the interesting things about fake memoirs--the authors often claim they did it for a higher cause; they wrote it to help others, not to help themselves, financially or otherwise.  When asked about the hundreds of thousands she stole from an elderly neighbor in Chicago, where she spent most of her life, she claims her husband and his mother got the money, and she feared they would harm her.  There's always someone else who is guilty, not her. Never her.

Her husband, as portrayed in the film, is incredibly strange.  The whole story is incredibly strange.  By the end of the documentary, it's all too strange to even care about the film any longer or the fake memoir or Norma Khouri.  Pathological liars are like spinning tops--you might watch them with interest for a while, but never very long.  Why?  It would be meaningless to do so.  A waste of time.  A top will never do anything but spin or fall over.

8407088,4,B003VSM4QQ,Norma Khouri really draws you in to her story.  Very well put together.  My mother entered the room while I was watching this and was immediately drawn in as well.  Worth watching.,1377734400,,180,4.5625
8407089,4,B003VSM4QQ,"She made more harm with the book to Muslim women that help. That there is Honor killing yes, but she used 9/11 to write a book because of the sentiments of the people.
To me her worse crimes were to denied her children and abandon them, also to rob the elderly lady.
At the beginning she is not even sure if she is Catholic or Orthodox.
I visited Jordan often, never had a problem as a western female. King Hussein was famous for going out by himself .
There are organizations that help women that are afraid.
I did not read the book and thought the film was a fiction, but it turned to be a very interesting bio of a con woman,a liar.
Well made, commend the director of showing all sides.
I would not by any book written by this person.",1377648000,2,737,4.160839160839161
