1826412,5,B0000844JY,"I just finished watching the entire RahXephon series and i can't get over just how great it is. I wasn't expecting much I bought it on a whim and even watched it right after Evangelion and Escaflowne. Lets just say it held its own and then some. Most people won't see the whole series for a while unless they get the import. But, believe me this series is worth it just watch it all the way through, it all wraps up very nicely.
WATCH THIS.... you won't be disappointed in the end.",1049673600,,481,4.239130434782608
1826413,5,B0000844JY,I am really hooked by this well animated and ploted anime.  I look forward to future volumes.  The way in which music is used is inventive and original.  The mecha designs are fabulous and the characters are not typical of this sort of anime.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1049328000,,263,4.6521739130434785
1826414,5,B0000844JY,"It's been a long time since Neon Genesis Evangelion came out and revolutionized the mecha anime.  Undoubtly, many tried to mimic the success and ultimately came short.
Meet RahXephon.  This series deliver the next step to the mecha anime that's been overdue.  From well drawn characters to storyline, this one surpassed my expectation for good.
This series never denies the influence of Evangelion.  Rather, it embrasses the basic concept and further develops in their own vision.  While some would simply say that there are too much similarity in between RahXephon and Evangelion, I never felt this as mere knockoff clone.  Once you start watching it, you would see that this is more like watching alter ego.  It gives the sense of alternate reality hence ""Parallel Universe"".
While mecha (or ""gear"" if you prefer) is the dominant factor of the series, it never overwhelm the series, nor shy away from the show.  Just like in Evangelion, mecha is bonded in personal level that cannot be broken.
Music is what makes this series special.  Exceptional combination of fast-paced Jazz and ambient sound of New Age creates uneasiness that makes you sit on the edge.  Sound is dominant theme of this series and it shows.
There aren't any ground-breaking acheivement in picture.  It has well drawn characters, and back ground; nothing notable.
Within the series, it shows the parallelism right from the beginning.  What's more interesting, is that also represents the struggle to break out of blue print created by Evangelion.  I believe that they finally found the way to stands out as it own.",1048032000,14,1587,5.011450381679389
1826415,5,B0000844JY,"I was really floored by how well this movie was made. Graphics, music, characters and plot were a welcome change. Its another mech movie but plot seems to have a good twist. The trailer for the movie does it no justice. If your looking to start a series give this one a shot. I hope you like it as much as I did and if not then my apologies. I've had a chance to glimpse it before it was released and I think it was really well rounded. Definitely a sleeper movie if you haven't seen the previews.",1046044800,2,497,4.081632653061225
1826416,4,B0000844JY,"Yes. This is another one of those deep, brooding mech animes following the vein of EVANGELION and ARGENTOSOMA, and yet it's different--and what I like about it is that it's still deep, but not as heavy as Evangelion.
Rahxephon follows Tokyo who is trapped in a ""protective dome"" and believing that the world outside of the dome is destroyed. But the world as the main character knows it becomes unravelling once he finds out that not only is the world outside fine (relatively speaking), but that his city is the attack base of a disguised alien race.
Of course controlling mechas come into play but what makes it interesting is the theme of music that's important to the mech. How the secrets behind everything unravel (imagine finding out that your mother bleeds blue blood) and how time travels at different speeds inside and outside the city is really interesting.
I'm only on episode five and the more I watch it, the more I'm drawn in.",1045612800,5,941,4.709090909090909
1826486,5,B0000844JY,"In my opinion this is way better than Evangelion. The only detriment to this show is that it's action choreography isn't that great, but the story is all more coherent after only a few episodes, and almost all the characters are relatable and likable, or atleast somewhat understandable. Also you could say that the music in Evangelion is better. Still I give this show high marks, a must watch if you liked Evangelion.",1495670400,,419,4.7534246575342465

1826488,4,B0000844JY,"To be honest this anime is intriguing. I love the fact Ayoto trying to find out his purpose, but in order for him to do so he has to look at his forgotten past. I loved the ending and yet I wish this anime were another season long. I don't know maybe add a new internal conflict within Ayoto that he strives to resolve. Other than that, great anime! Only 2 reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is for the fact Ayoto can get with a 29 year old at the age of 17 and I struggle keeping women my age lol and the romance is too slow in developing.",1492473600,,540,3.7876106194690267
1826489,2,B0000844JY,"Fantastic artwork and pretty good voice acting, but that's where the excellence ends.

But something must have gotten lost in translation.  Even though this show has voiceovers, I've found shows with only subtitles (Kuromukuro, Attack on Titan, etc.) to be far less confusing.  After eight episodes, I didn't understand a single character's motivations, and some of the exchanges between characters seem completely meaningless.

1826612,3,B0000844JY,"RahXephon is a decent anime series that was originally released about a decade ago. For its time, it had pretty good visuals, a nice soundtrack, and was fairly interesting compared to its contemporaries. RahXephon somewhat rode the wave of popularity that Neon Genesis Evangelion popularized in the mid '90's; adding giant fighting monsters fought gainst and piloted by teenagers to a coming of age story with psychological elements. I will note that the title here may be somewhat misleading; RaXephon only has one season and it has a pretty definite ending concluding the plot. So don't expect a season two.

RahXephon's plot follows our main character Ayato Kamina, a somewhat introverted, but otherwise well adjusted teen, with dreams of becoming a professional artist. He lives in Tokyo Jupiter, believing that there are some handful of a million people that live on Earth, as he was taught in school. The story comes to reveal why the denizens of Tokyo Jupiter believe this and what is going on outside of their little bubble. Ayato becomes swept up in a chain of events that will forever reshape the world when he encounters the Xephon and becomes determined to find the truth about his world. Along the way, Ayato meets a variety of characters, all with their own motivations and desires which are often at odds with those of other characters', making for some interesting dynamics that move the plot in various directions.

The animation is somewhat dated, the voice acting can be hit or miss and is rather quiet at times, particularly during dialogue heavy scenes, whereas the sound effects or music for action scenes will be blaring, and the plot does have some contrived and convoluted aspects to it. Having watched it several times (back in the day anime was harder to come by and we'd buy DVDs, so one might be more inclined to watch a series multiple times), I am more or less familiar with what happens in the story. Rewatching it recently on Amazon Prime, I did pick up little details I missed years ago, but the series is nice to watch as a throwback to an earlier time, as well as it being a great anime to have on in the background. So, I pop this on if I am doing something else that requires my attention; I enjoy its aesthetic for its time, it is easy on my eyes and much of its music is beautiful, I particularly like the opening and closing songs. I would recommend however that a first time viewer pay closer attention to keep up with the plot.

Overall, I would say nostalgia plays a factor in my analysis of this anime, it is by no means a ""must see anime"", it doesn't have a lot about it that really stands out in and of itself, but it is still fairly enjoyable for the art and some of the more endearing characters. RaXephon is a decent anime.",1477180800,,2773,4.609311740890688
1826613,5,B0000844JY,I would like to say how much I enjoyed this anime and I hope to see future episodes thank you very much,1476489600,,103,3.727272727272727

1826615,4,B0000844JY,"I definitely enjoyed it. Unless I missed a setting though, the lack of a translation for the Japanese words shown on the screen made for some confusion and the end seemed a little too abstract for me, though that could easily be a cultural thing since I'm not Japanese.

Eventually, he will be placed in situations where his actions may hurt the closest to him. He does pilot a mecha named the Rahxephon but, that is all I will say.

The plot is a bit complex and gets so towards the end of the story but if you can follow along it is very fulfilling. Now what really hurts, or at least handicaps, this anime is that if you've seen Neon Genesis Evangelion you will see some similar plot beats. However it's just different enough that it forms it's own path and even improves on some ideas established in Eva. All in all good series, give it a watch if you have the time.",1471910400,,515,4.16

However this series is more endearing to me as it is not anchored on teenage angst but on a lost love story. That is where the strength of this series lies. That and a pilot that is not a whiny teenager. Put those two things together and there is only love to give to this series. It takes a few episodes to find the lost love story, so stick with it.  You  may now put together this plot earlier than you should. But finding out the lost love plot come together makes you want to go back and revisit previous episodes just to see a flash of heartache.",1465171200,2,721,4.1063829787234045

Long Review: I went into this with low expectations. I'd been told that it was extremely similar to Evangelion, basically a copy. So I wasn't really going in with high hopes. And wow, did it blow me away. This was amazing. Besides Eva and Eureka Seven, I don't think I've seen a better Mecha anime. The story was incredible for something that resembled Eva so much. The soundtrack was one of the best I've heard. And the romance was subtle at first, then evolved into something amazing. If I had to recommend an anime to binge, it'd be this one.",1455062400,4,603,4.4818181818181815

Lots of character development and the best thing, the series actually ends with season 1 so no, no CLIFFhanger!! That's 5 stars in my book. Although the series was created in 2003, a near decade and a half ago, the plot and graphics are fairly futuristic. Given timing, please don't expect HD quality but rather, a well-illustrated/drawn anime with good detail and color balancing. The few mechs/robots were great but it's the storyline that really shines. Now just go watch the movie - also on Amazon Prime - after you finish this so you can satisfy that climatic taste of elation when you finish this. The chapters flowed smoothly and often said to myself 'just one more.' Great musical score, production and English voice production; I wonder how the original would've sounded. There's a lot of folks who say this is somewhat heavily borrowed from the Evangelion series, which unfortunately isn't available on Prime so I can't compare.",1454284800,3,1034,5.052631578947368

WHATSOFREAKING EVER. I got 6 episodes in and I still didn't understand it. And no its not bc i'm stupid, I grew up watching dragon ball z and have watched anime my whole life. But this????? I even went to the wiki for it: http://rahxephon.wikia.com/wiki/RahXephon_Anime_Wiki  and even the wiki doesn't make sense. If I wanted to be infinitely confused, I would request the creators of the show LOST to make an anime, and even LOST makes more sense than this anime. I understand that most anime thrive off of the main character not asking important questions and just ""going with it"" for everything they do, but come on. Put at least a dab of realism in there. Ask a few questions. And don't just stop bc someone who's trying to be retardedly vague just gives a little moan and walks away. Sometimes its infuriating. Whats this big giant thing? Whats that big giant thing? Where did you come from? why are you here? What happened to me? Who is this girl nobody sees but me? Why do people bleed blue? Why are these baby faced floating mechs singing? Why do they fight each other and then me? What is going on?
None of it makes sense. And they don't even try to explain it. I keep going through these reviews, and its all ""OHHHHHHH its so pretty and the visual give a taste of creative placement-"" WTF who cares? It doesn't matter if the entire show makes no sense and people are just going about their lives not asking any questions. Must be nice to have a show where you don't have to explain anything and can just keep going. Save yourself the trouble and skip this.

By the last episode, I found myself saying out-loud ""This is the stupidest f%*@ing show.""

The love triangles were cool until they became the primary focus of the entire show, with little else to offer except for the typical relationship reveal at the end of an episode, i.e. This person is someone's daughter, or this person is someone's grandfather.

Had the series been 10-12 episodes long, it would have been absolutely incredible!

5 Stars for the beginning,

1 Star for episodes 10+  (There's a few good ones in there if they didn't focus on Haruka).",1426896000,2,836,4.710344827586207

1827066,5,B0000844JY,"this Anime is in a class of stories that isn't quite for all viewers. First off the story begins slowly to enable viewers to learn who the characters are, onc  that happens then the REAL story telling starts. This isn't the cutsie saturday morning story for the kids, its a story made for older viewers. Its a story with deep issues such as racism (done in the form of hatred for an alien race), it also deals with life choices and how we hav  to live with them. Bottom line is Rahxephon is romantic tale about first loves, and how they stay with you for life. The story is told with the backdrop of a war between the people of earth and an alien race called Mulians. The Mulians have taken over Japan, sealing it inside a time bubble where the difference of time passage is slow for those inside. those outside of the bubble life weeks for just a few hours passage of time for those inside. This time differance sets up the story for the main characters. Boy and Girl meet in school, Boy and girl fall in love. She moves away with jer family, and then the aliens invade. Since she lives outside the bubble, when boy and girl meet again she is now an adult, while her lost love is still teenager. They must cope with the passage of time that has occured all while the war against the alien wages. Also knowing all the while that the boy is the pilot of the mecha that is the earths only hope. But keep in mind the boy is also the offspring of the leader of the aliens. This story is told with numerous twists and turns of various sorts, dramatic, romantic, comedic, an  more. I think the characters o  the story ar  compelling, interesting and worth watching. However this is a VERY complex anime, and is not one I would advise for the inexperienced anime viewer. If you are a first timer or not much anime experience I advise trying something like Last Exile, or maybe Cowboy Bebop.

1827082,4,B0000844JY,"RahXephon is a very interesting take on the giant robot anime and does the whole trend of going metaphysical / spiritual with  mecha anime quite well. The characters are its strongest point, with some of the most likable and memorable characters in an anime I've ever seen. Unfortunately, the English dub isn't as successful as it should be. There are certain scenes in which it's important to understand the what's written in walls and other areas and there were no subtitles to understand them. There's also quite a problem with the volume in which the voices were recorded, with come characters just talking too low to understand well which is compounded when they're using terms such as ""Ollin."" Anyway, that isn't enough to truly detract, but this show would be much better without those issues (which in honesty is not a problem with the source material, but with the dubbed version).",1392854400,,890,4.894039735099338

1827110,2,B0000844JY,"This review was written after making it halfway into episode 9.  Had I watched the series to the end, my review might have been different.  Unfortunately, the series couldn't keep my attention that long, and I will explain why.

  First off, let me say that I am in no way an expert on Anime.  When I do watch anime, I do it for a few reasons.  First, a good story.  I love a good story that drives the series.  I don't like shows that have ""fluff"" episodes.  I define ""fluff"" episodes as episodes that do not contribute in anyway to the plot, and can be skipped without leaving the viewer confused later on.  To me, those kinds of episodes say ""we don't have enough content to make a full series, so we'll put in another trivial episode just so we can make money"".  Second, I like a series that ends.  You have a story to tell, you tell it, and then its over.  Even if you are incredibly successful and make a bajillion dollars, and have fans screaming for more, you end it!  Why?  Because the story is over.  Adding another season just because you made enough money off of the previous one, especially when the writers have to put together a whole new story, is just an invitation for more fluff. American television is notorious for this.  If your show was successful, then congratulations!  You came up with fantastic original content!  Go create something new again and stop milking the old series you created until its dead and fans hate it.  Third, I hate, HATE, anime that has shallow female characters whose only purpose for being in the show is to show off their disproportionate physicality.  I feel like it is insulting my intelligence as a viewer for them to think that they can plug story holes by throwing half naked characters at me. There is no small abundance of these types of anime out there, and I avoid them like the plague.

  I have watched a few series here and there that I felt were driven by the story, such as Fullmetal Alchemist, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (which I enjoyed immensely), 00Gundam, and Moribito: Guardian of the spirit.  I felt like these all, more or less, and some more than others, met my personal requirements for a good show.  After reading good reviews about Rah Xephon and its ""excellent character development"", I thought I would give it a go.

  The first couple of episodes did not disappoint.  By the time the main character, Ayato, had met up with the organization ""Terra"", I was thinking this was going to be another solid anime series.  There was a mystery about the show that made me want to keep watching!  Who were the ""mulians""?  What had happened to Tokyo?  What was the motivation of the strange evil powers inside tokyo jupiter for sending out the death singing robots (Dolems, I believe they were called).  Whats up with the mysterious Reika?

  The next 5 episodes or so were a big disappointment. It felt like the show had been reduced down to high school drama.  Character A likes character B.  BUT WAIT! Character B doesn't like character A, he likes Character C!  The plot thickens!!! *barf*  All of the character development that had happened in the first few episodes went out the window as all of them were reduced to 1-D shallow teenage romance characters.  Even the only female character who had any kind of development, Haruka, was reduced to a giggly school-girl type character.  When, in episode 9, the writers took the time to put each of the female characters into a swimsuit and get good shots of their physique, I was done.  No real effort had been made to explain any of the previously mentioned mysteries.  I am ok with being left in the dark, even until the last episode.  In fact, sometimes the best stories are the ones where everything makes sense at the very end.  I get it.  But for crying out loud, at least dangle a carrot in front of me to keep me going!  Give me some small new revelation about the story, the characters and their motivations in each episode!  Answer a small mystery and make an even bigger one in the process!

  The main character became weak in my eyes when he was willing to put himself into harms way for a strange organization that kidnapped him without even an explanation of what had happened to his world!  Taking time to explain that would have made his character more believable, since it would have given him motivation to fight for Terra, as well as make the story less confusing for the viewer.  With Ayato being a fish out of water in the real world, so to speak, they had a wonderful opportunity to explain what and why things were going on.  Have a character explain to Ayato what the heck had happened to tokyo.  Explain to him why some people bleed blue.

Don't give it all away, but at least give little tidbits to keep the viewers interested.

  In conclusion, the show had a strong start (why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), but couldn't keep the story strong enough in the next several episodes to keep my attention.  Does it get better later on?  Maybe.

I like the style of the images and the music, but the animation is weak; it's almost like having a story read to you when you were a child.  The story does draw you in - it's like a puzzle to be solved, and the main character is very sympathetic.

Unfortunately, none of them are interesting, with the main character simply being so discontinuous that its laughable.

1827137,5,B0000844JY,"As of 2012 Rahxephon remains one of the all around best anime of the 21st centary thus far.
However many (including some on this very site) claim that the whole series is invalid because it is apparently oh-so very much like Evangelion. Whatever my opinions on that series are (don`t like the tv series, find the rebuild films quite good.) dosen`t matter because the comparisons between the two equal a small amount of jot notes. But something as slopply written and unorignal as code geass gets shelves of awards and acclaim. There truly is no justice in the anime fan world.

But all the fan outcry much as It bothers me can`t destroy this brilant show. If evangelion is this brute force of ideas attacking you, Rahxephon is a light that slowly almost unnoticbly consumes you. It is incredibly subtile in both it`s ideas (there is a brillant metaphor involving the main charecter and a bird that I didn`t relize until long after the fact.) aand ploting. Every question involving the series mytholgy is answered. However even if you are given the pieces they excpect you to put them togheter. Don`t go in expecting a summer cruise.

The charecterzation isn`t as subtle but it is just as wonderful. Proving depth without angst is possible and it really is the point of the show. The tone is really wonderfully strange and exotic. Most if not all episodes have terific action scenes (The animation is a decade later still amazing)but there the cherry, not the cake.

Everyone still knows that one person who finds anime to be a waste of time. Show them Rahxephon. It`s a true masterclass in storytelling beating any of the crap mainstream Hollywood studios or stupid, popular shows like Breaking Bad attempt or undeserved nerd overlords Joss Whedon or Daemon Lindeloft could ever hope to make. It could change there view on ``those Japanese cartoons``. forever.

P.S. Many reviewers have said that Rahxephon will be remebered due to it supposed similariteies to evangelion. If that turns out to be the case it will be due to pepole`s arrogance rather than the show itself.",1345075200,2,2071,4.825352112676057
1827138,5,B0000844JY,"With ""RahXephon Orchestration 1: Threshold"", one of the greatest anime epics of all time begins.  No, scratch that - with ""RahXephon Orchestration 1: Threshold"", one of the greatest Epics of all time - filmed, written, or otherwise - begins.

  The Tokyo of the near future - the last human city on Earth, home to all - 23 million? I think it was 23 million; something in that range anyway - surviving human beings.  The final bastion against the alien Mu, who control the rest of the planet and have since their coming 15 years ago.

  The secret - in reality, the Mu don't control the rest of the world, only Tokyo itself, which is sealed off inside a bubble that the inhabitants of Tokyo think is a guard Against the Mu.  And outside the bubble - which is known as Tokyo Jupiter to the rest of the world - the planet is locked in a global war against the Mu.  And oh, it's been more than 15 years outside Tokyo Jupiter since the Mu came - the speed of time's flow has been altered inside the bubble.

  Though the animation is simpler than what you'd find in, say, ""Millennium Actress"" or ""Princess Mononoke"", that minor hitch is blown to nothingess in the face of a saga whose concepts, overall designs, characterizations, mysteries, and overall story elevate it right up to the peak of anime along with films like the above-mentioned and alongside anime like ""Castle In The Sky"" and ""Haibane Renmei"".  Although the animation could have probably used a bit bigger budget, the design work that went into making each character, each ship or device or mech, and each locale distinctive and easily recognizable is extremely impressive, and a huge boon to a series with so many players.  Special mention must be made of the voice cast as well, who bring their individual characters to life with emotion and nuances unique to each player.

  In ""Threshold"", an incursion is finally made by a lone female agent into the world of Tokyo Jupiter, to bring out both a teenage boy - whose relevance becomes clearer in progressive volumes - and the RahXephon, a giant robot which has the potential to be the most effective weapon on the planet for fighting the Mu.  And this is just the beginning of Volume 1 - a huge amount of happenings go on in the RahXephon saga, and the beginning is particularly fast-paced.  This isn't intended to be just half-watched by casual viewers, it's something to pay close attention to and rewatch and think and dream about.

1827139,3,B0000844JY,"I know, many people have said this already that this and EVA are very similar, well it's true.  The characters, and story for the most part are actully almost the same.  The only thing that seperates RehXephon from a masterpiece like EVA is presentation.  EVA goes right off and tells you what it's about, suposedly. It is actully one of the most thought provoking animes ever. It has wondefully drawn out characters that have much development, not emotionally nessicerily, but mentally.  Because EVA so deeply examines human nature, religion, our thoughts and fears, etc. etc. that is one of the many reasons as to why it is a masterpiece.

Now then RahXephon, just feels like a broken record. The characters feel bland and repeated, the story isn't at all that very deep.  It moreover examines what we think is reality. (Susposedly, honestly I don't see how this can be called a masterpiece)  Sure I can see what people are saying, but really it just feels like it's all been done before.  But with a new not nearly as deep or thought-provoking twist. The characters for most part are blah as well, many of them seem to be once again cheap knock-offs of EVA.  Their depth doesn't really go that deep either, and the show is pretty damn predictable. Sure RahXephon may look nice, if not exactly look like EVA, but nice looks can't save an average anime.

One final note:

I'm tired of people saying this is more deep and convoluted then Evangelion.  People who say that obviously did not understand EVA, or did not know the work that went into it.

EVA is still one of the most deep and thought out animes to date.  It was one of the first to actully make people think about themselves and the world around them.  EVA also discusses many themes and is more open for interpretation, RahXephon, is not.

It really feels like RahXephon is trying to be the new messiah, but it fails horriblly and becomes the annoying little brother, or John in the bible, whichever you see fit.",1153872000,,1975,4.616045845272207

If people think that Rahxephon is getting this from Eva, then they are terribly mistaken, for Eva itself got these concepts from classic early 80's anime. Also, the stories are quite different. And the story is the most important part of an anime. While Eva focuses on the characters not being able to depend on each other and being alone, Rahxephon (in my oppinion.) is more about whats real and whats not, should you believe in what you've known all your life, or in what is new, yet more realistic and dependable.

1827144,4,B0000844JY,"This review covers the whole series, because I didn't feel like writing a separate spiel for each DVD.

Rahxephon falls frustratingly short of greatness. I say frustratingly, because you can FEEL greatness so very, very close throughout the series. The production values are generally fantastic; the artwork is classic. The love story driving the plot is both convoluted and brilliant. Small moments and minor characters flesh out the world to the point where it almost seems real. There are moments of action and of character development that are glorious. And yet the series manages to fall just short, just shy of true greatness.

The similarities with Evangelion are the first problem. The parallels are too easily drawn, and in some episodes RahXephon feels almost like an elaborately conceived fan project. There's no reason to go too deeply into this, though, because it's really the sign of a larger problem, which is that the writing is frustratingly uneven. Although the script meticulously shows a number of tiny, important moments, other events are painted in such broad strokes that they become almost a form of caricature. For instance, the staff of TERRA consists almost entirely of attractive women, almost all of whom throw themselves at Ayato within days of his arrival in a transparent and silly display of adolescent wish-fulfillment. Only one of them has an excuse for this; after about the third it just seems stupid. It could have been better. The motivation behind the events of the show is also poorly defined. It's never made clear why the Mu (or Bahbem) are doing what they do. Why did the Mu attack? Why do they want our world?

The epilogue in the final episode neatly encapsulates the show's problem. It ties everything that has happened in the series, from its first moment to its last, into a neat, convoluted, and spectacular package. And at the same time, it leaves you thinking, 'Bahbem, Ayato, and the Mu went through all that... for THAT?' In a way, the mundane nature of the retuning has a message of its own... but it's a trite message, and it ultimately trivializes the rest of the series.

The show's music also shows the same frustrating lack of attention. The music is in almost all cases generic, bland, and western in character. In a show that admirably avoided the contemporary anime obsession with Judeo-Christian religious motifs, this is particularly disappointing. Native American music could have been mined in the same way as Aztec and Mayan symbology. Just a little more attention to detail would have done the trick -- and given that the whole series is predicated on the importance of music, it seems odd that more attention was not paid.

So, it's frustrating. The art (in particular some of the dolem designs), the characters, and much of the plot is fantastic, wonderful and worthy of mention with the best in anime. But there are so many places where RahXephon stumbles in its story and dialogue, and the music, which should have been a major strength, turns into a major weakness. So rather than greatness, RahXephon must settle for 'very good'-ness. That's not BAD, and RahXephon is a wonderful series in many ways. If you want to watch an anime that's occasionally thought-provoking and includes a deep, moving love story, then RahXephon is your ticket. It's a very good series.

But it isn't great. And it could have been.",1099785600,4,3385,4.919439579684764
1827145,4,B0000844JY,"Many people have commented on the similarities of Rahxephon to the seminal anime classic Neon Genesis Evangelion, and having viewed both in their entirety its easy to see why.  Rahxephon borrows heavily from Evangelion (henceforth Eva) for both its premise and narrative.  Nearly every major character in Eva has an analogous counterpart in Rahxephon, and if you swap out Eva's Christian symbolism for Rahxephon's musical references the overall plots are strikingly similar.  Yet to simply dismiss Rahxephon as an Eva knockoff is to dismiss one of the best made anime series of the past few years.

The most immediately noticable aspect of Rahxephon is the stellar production values.  The animation is simply gorgeous, made all the more beautiful by a flawless DVD transfer.  The characters and mechs more with a convincing grace and fluidity not always present in anime TV series, and the amount of detail in the backgrounds is stunning.  Also of note is the entire look of the show.  The characters are realistically proportioned while still retaining that anime flaire (ie big eyes, spiky hair, etc.).  The mechs are among to more interesting designs seen as of late, which like the characters are convincing yet stylized.  The other mechanical aspects of the show, such as tanks, fighters, and ships, are all realistically detailed and help to sell the not-too-distant future setting.

This volume introduces a bevy of characters, yet they are all uniquely designed so that keeping track of who's who isn't a problem at all.  You may not be able to keep all the Japanese names straight (it certainly took me a while), but you'll never have trouble recognizing a face.  And for once in an anime, the characters go through realistic costume changes instead of wearing the same outfit all the time.  We also get a lot of solid character development in this volume, although of course there's plenty more the come.

Then there's the narrative.  Although it does bear several strong resemblances to Eva, there's more than enough that's different to distinguish the two series.  For instance, the plot twist that occurs midway through this volume is completely unexpected and helps to keep things fresh.  Rahxephon also spends a lot of time on the details, slowly trickling information to the viewer one juicy detail at a time.  I'm currently rewatching the series a second time, and I'm amazed at how much more there is to this show than I picked up on the first time around.  Rahxephon is a show that rewards repeat viewings.

Although outwardly similar, anyone who gives Rahxephon a chance will see its not really like Evangelion at all.  Rahxephon is a smart, high-concept anime that is executed wonderfully.  The show steadily guides the audience along without being too obvious about anything.  If you're looking for a show to make you think, Rahxephon is definitely worth picking up.  And after all, one can only watch Eva so many times.",1092009600,14,2942,4.991786447638604
1827146,1,B0000844JY,"My initial review of RahXephon was an upload of profanity. Going back to it, I still feel that it is absolutely terrible.

First off, I highly recommend you spend your money on Neon Genesis Evangelion, because that is where the ideas for RahXephon have all come from. I could not believe the amount of ideas, down to even the music, that was taken from it. Some may believe that imitation is a form of flattery, but with RahXephon, it neither betters NGE in ANY aspect, nor does it provide anything original.

Yes the animation is great, but the premise, story telling and originality are lacklustre and severely worthy of more critisism than praise. The only area I could say that would benefit you to watch RahXephon is if you are consciously searching for a basic, simplified plotline where you have facts thrown at you. There is less viewer involvement, poor characterisation, and it comes of as far more cheesy than classy.

If you've already seen NGE and want to know what RahXephon is about, don't waste your time. You will immediately feel lulled into drawing comparisons and can forget about attempting to enjoy what little is on offer. One of my initial thoughts was, 'how could the creators of RahXephon live with themselves for such immitation?'.

I was so dissapointed after I purchased it that I attempted to sell it second-hand. Please do yourself a favour and spend your money on NGEvangelion. Watch it first, and you will thank me for the advice later.",1086393600,4,1469,4.771653543307087
1827147,3,B0000844JY,"Having already watched much of the wildly acclaimed anime available in the US such as Evangelion, TekkamonBlade, Cowboy Bepop, etc., I was not expecting to be so intrigued by this series. Rahxephon is a fairly new and mainstream animation which is supposedly, as my friend had mentioned before I bought into the series, an almost direct clone of Evangelion.
The story in Rahxephon is deep. Since I detest spoilers, I will only state that the plot is based on music and revolves around giant mecha combat, aliens, and the adolescent psyce. The animation is crisp and up to date. The battle scenes are beautifuly detailed and choreographed and the characters draw you with heavy dialogue and wonderful voice acting. Even the ""ultimate resolution"" at the end of the series was faboulously done and not as parodoxical as some Animes which I have seen.
The only area in which this anime fails is that it is preceded by Evangelion. If you strip away the element of music, one of the things that makes this animation truly exceptional, this anime looks EXACTLY like evangelion; the characters, mecha, and emotions are, if not directly duplicated, extremely similar. This unorigionality left me dissatisified with the animation as a whole. It felt like I was watching an alternate version of Evangelion and because of this, the emotions and actions of the characters did not have any impact on me. HOWEVER, if you have not viewed Evangelion, I beseech you to buy this series and revel in it.
The packaging and the DVDs themselves, are excellent. This anime should not be viewed by children for it is stark and violent and uterly devoid of ""fuzzy"" comedy relief.",1084320000,7,1653,4.8861209964412815
1827148,5,B0000844JY,"(This will be spoiler free, and as a result, brief.  I don't want to give away a thing!)
  I recently finished watching this series and I have to say that it has been one of the best viewing experiences of my life.
  The animation is fluid, smooth, and breathtaking.  Strategic placement of various backdrops and images enhance the story, whether by foreshadowing an event to come, or connecting an event from the past.
  You can tell from the titles themselves that RahXephon has a very strong musical undertone, and in fact is an integral part of the story.  The result is music that is haunting, stirring...memorable.
  Above all else the characters are what makes or breaks a story - and these made it many times over.  The diversity of characters ensures that you can relate and empathize with at least one, if not more.  They are simple, complex, mysterious, or a little bit of each - tied together with the perfect voices, making these characters come to life.  You find yourself laughing with them, crying in sorrow, in rage, in joy.  You no longer see 'characters', but real souls going through myriad experiences and taking you along for the ride.
  After finishing this story I find myself feeling as if I had lost a close friend, since I will never again be able to discover this world and these people for the 'first time'.  I'm sure all of you have gone through a similar experience, and realized how profound it was, and how much you wanted to share it with your family and friends, anyone who would listen.  RahXephon has been such an experience for me, and it is one I will not soon forget.",1074729600,30,1607,4.575438596491228
1827149,4,B0000844JY,"First off this show is really nothing like NGE, in my opinion it is  alot like Brain Powered (look it up for a description). This is a series that never lets you know what is going on or what the plot is and by the end its still not too clear. The fact that the characters are interesting and there are lots of battles and the curiosity to know whats going on when not much about the plot is revealed kept me watching. I read this series was by the creator of Gasaraki witch turned me off a little since that series sucked so bad, but this was really entertaining to watch.",1074470400,2,573,4.116071428571429
1827150,5,B0000844JY,"I've been looking at this for a long time. Obviously it appealed to me due to my deep love for Mecha-based anime, but I wanted to do a little basic research before buying it. After reading some basic info, I decided to buy it, and was lucky enough to find this box set at a Best Buy in New Hampshire, where there's no sales tax, and its about $15 cheaper than on this site. What I got was simply amazing. The animation is crisp and smooth, truly a thing of beauty at many points. The plot so far is very cool, and it's already drawn me in. Like what some have said, it bears some resemblance to Neon Genesis Evangelion, a series which I have the utmost respect for, but it is indeed its own show, and definetely a great show. The characters I've seen so far are excellent and feel very real, and there is some humor in it that makes it a little better(I believe episode 5 is the one with some humorous moments, such as a dinner scene, where there is a subtle but funny reference to sex made by a certain character^_^). The series is definetely going to be one I will keep my eye on in the coming months after each week's paycheck...
And another great thing, this DVD actually is worth the $30 I paid for it. The artbox it comes with for storing all seven DVDs is cool, and I love the shirt it comes with, it has a great black-and-white drawing of RahZephon on it. And of course, the five complete episodes makes it a good starting place for the series...",1065916800,2,1454,4.21505376344086
1827151,5,B0000844JY,"It's been a while since I've seen an anime whit as much depth as RahXephon.  Although many people have compared it to Neon Genesis Evangelion this is really not a correct comparison.  Although they share similar themes their stories and the way the plot unfolds are total different.  While in Neon Genesis Evangelion the anime revolves around the mecha and the pilot's reaction to them and through them, in RahXephon the mecha is just a means to an end.  The story is more about the main character, Ayato Kamina come to terms whit him self and the two worlds he is a part of.  In Evangrlion the story was forced on the characters.  In RahXephon the characters actions force the plot.  There is no predicted dooms day approaching and there is never any feeling that he is the only hope for mankind.  He is just a kid whit a talent and the world will not end just because something happens to him. This allows for a more realistic character that's easy to relate to.
The Artwork and CG is some of the best that I have seen in anime.  They blended the two together so well that in many scenes it becomes hard to tell what is CG and what is drawn.  The music very well done, it is predictable enough that it easily brings out the proper emotion for the scene but also surprising and strong enough to be remarkable and memorable.",1063152000,8,1324,4.411522633744856
1827152,5,B0000844JY,"I wasn't terribly interested in this series when I first had a chance to see it and didn't have any real idea what it was really about, but after watching the first episode I was drawn in and completely hooked. The story is interesting and compelling while the animation style and mecha designs are absolutely beautiful. Through out the series I found all the characters to be very fascinating and extremely well developed. As far as the DVDs themselves go I am very pleased too. The inserts contain some great translator notes and other extras.
A lot of reviewers tend to compare Rahxephon to Evangelion, but I don't really think it's all that great of a comparison. Rahxephon is a much better series in my opinion. The characters have much more depth and have more reasonable motivations for their actions and are considerably more believable while the angst is less severe and more reasonable when it is present. The allusions and references are much more literary, like the aliens being called the Mu after Churchward's lost continent of Mu which I believe is often referenced in H.P. Lovecraft, and several rather apt references to various works of Japanese literature. Also the series has an awesome ending which while really weird and somewhat nonsensical at first eventually revealed a wealth of wonderful irony and assorted goodness after I thought about it for a moment. All of which leads to a wonderful series that I greatly enjoyed.",1063152000,7,1445,4.90204081632653
1827153,5,B0000844JY,"RahXephon is a sci-fi anime with an intriguing story. Editorial review and description does a good job for summarizing the overall scenerio, so there is no need to lengthen my review. RahXephon resembles Neon Genesis Evangelion in many respects but it doesn't have the drawbacks of Evangelion that I mentioned in my review of its complete set. If you enjoy science-fiction books or movies having interesting and intriguing subjects, you will enjoy RahXephon as much as I do. If you need an example from anime to make your decision, I can say that the ones liked Gasaraki will probably like RahXephon, too.
Video and audio quality of this DVD edition is very good. Most anime fans dislike dubbing and prefer to watch Japanese sound with English subtitles. However, subtitles are not that good. I found out that listening an important conversation, which you couldn't understand it at first, for a second time is much more efficient than figuring out what happened from subtitles. You should notice that there are actually two English subtitles. First subtitle is the regular one and the second one is similar to the ""Pill"" option of Akira, it only translates Japanese words on the video and background conversation on scenes such as a news heard from a TV. This second English subtitle is benefical to turn on.
Leaflets on DVD's are very welcome and useful. There are fully coloured drawings of mechas and persons together with a brief information. The leaflet of this first volume also includes short interviews with Japanese cast. Other extras in this DVD are :
 - Clean opening animation : Animation is very good but the music is spectacular. I really love this opening music, even though I mostly listen to metal music. You can watch the animation and particularly listen to the music over and over again.
 - Clean closing animation : Closing music is boring for me, but you may want to watch it as the words are closely tied to the overall story.
 - Special Japanese promo trailer : This is fine, too but not that much important.
 - Production sketches : These are clearly drawn in full color and the fantastic opening music accompanies them.
 - ADV previews : No ADV disc can be without them. They are welcome for me, this is easier than searching the Net for them.
The first volume of RahXephon includes the first five episodes. You can use this first volume to make your decision about whether you will want to see the other volumes or not. The story is not concluded in currently available four volumes I bought but I strongly believe that the series will keep up with the good pace I saw so far. I, as a science fiction fan, give five stars to this volume as well as the other three and I am looking forward for the rest.",1061424000,3,2730,4.679166666666666

The series starts off strong with some powerful visuals and impressive animation.  However, I just can't get around the fact that the main mecha has stupid-looking wings on its head!  The series starts off strong but swiftly becomes derivative and predictable.  I'd consider this series the poor man's alternative to EVA and Blue Sub Number Six.  But if you're a poor man, stop blowing all your money on anime. :)",1059350400,3,535,4.709677419354839
1827156,5,B0000844JY,"Everyone who is attempting to compare this to Eva is missing the point. I've watched Eva, repeatedly. Hell, I own all of Eva on DVD. I've watched RahXephon repeatedly as well, and am in the process of buying the R1 DVDs as they come out. I'm sorry but, while there are some similarities between the two series (OMG MECHA), RahXephon has incredible character development, artwork, music, and depth. Eva, well, whiny Shinji, an awful dub of Auska, ""I WILL NOT RUN AWAY""^3, a terrible ending to the OVA, and two movies that served as a giant ""I hate you"" to the fans. Forget that. I'll take my opera that is RahXephon anyday.
The music in this series is MINDBLOWINGLY good. The animation is GORGEOUS, although not exactly GITS SAC or Macross Plus. The story is incredible, and is one of the few animes that I have watched that has repeat value. Every time you see this series again, you will understand the plot in a whole new light and really enjoy it.
I'm sorry Eva fanboys. Give it up. I know there's been a lot of knock-offs, but realize that this series doesn't build on mecha with obnoxious Christian symbolism. It totally redefines the mecha genre with an entirely new standard of quality.",1055116800,,1193,4.605633802816901
1827157,5,B0000844JY,"It is unfair to call RahXephon a pale shadow of, or a poor man's Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series, which appears to be a Neon Genesis clone on first look, ultimately stands on its own, even bettering Evangelion, arguably the best anime series ever, in some aspects.
Ayato Kamina's mundane life comes to a shattering halt during an attack on Tokyo by ""invaders."" Ayato rushes from his friends and the subway wreck they are in to find help, instead separately meeting two women who will put his ideas of ""reality"" to the test. Soon, he finds out that he has been actually living in a enclosed space on Earth called Tokyo-Jupiter, ruled by an invading species of Murians, where time passes at a slower rate. The outside world, some 13 years ahead in time, has been trying to recover Tokyo-Jupiter and its oblivious inhabitants. Ayato, who is the only one able to pilot a giant robot--which battles with a variety of weapons, and uniquely with sound--called RahXephon, seems the outside Earth's only hope.
The beginning parts of the series move with a medium-pace, despite the giant robot battles and the numerous realizations Ayato begins to reach. They aren't as fast as they should be, but each episode is crucial to the series. Things pick up just after the 15th episode, when Ayato makes a return to Tokyo-Jupiter. The series shifts into overdrive at this point, with battles, revelations and emotions all running high and fast. Unlike Evangelion, however, RahXephon does provide the viewer with a sense of closure.
Whether you like the art or not is subjective; it falls exactly between the clean, flat, thick-lines of Gasaraki and the detailed, liney art of Evangelion. The CG effects are some of the best in anime, not for how spectacular they are, but how well they blend in with the regular art (it's extremely difficult to tell which is which). The music is predictable in most places (battle scenes, somber, sadder scenes) but also throws in some stranger selections (i.e. a techno beat, off beat to a chase sequence) that are slightly off, but create a good effect.
This is definitely a three-watcher: watch once to get acquainted, twice to understand, and three times for a fully enjoyable viewing effect. The characters (other than Ayato) are all well-developed, and explored. Each shares some significant role within the series, with many strange connections and relationships unknown to most of the characters. The series doesn't quite go as deep as Evangelion, the fault of its broader focus. The series covers racism or speciesism, identity, human relationships, and the all-important factors of sound and time.
RahXephon will live up to all your anime and giant robot expectations, with a superior storyline, and original ideas. Highly-recommended.",1054684800,,2768,5.019565217391304
1827158,5,B0000844JY,"It's not that bad reviewers can't help comparing this title to Evangelion it's just that it should be compared to it because it borrows so much from it.  As far as I can tell the production crew that does Rahxephon has much to do with Cowboy Bebop and to me Rahxephon comes off as a mix between Eva and Bebop.  The main character Ayato almost looks like a cross between Spike and Shinji, call me crazy.  Ayato will come off as confident and assertive at times like Spike.  In more dire situations, he will act stubborn and childish like Shinji.  There are a vast amount of parallels that I will go into later.  Regardless of it's borrowing, Rahxephon has great production values.  The animation is seamless and incredible expecially during battle sequences.  The first time Allegretto made an appearance it blew me away.  The mech designs rival Eva and I love Unit-01's design while the character designs are almost as good.  It is beautiful, enough said.  The music is good but I refrain from judging on that until I see the entire series.  The plot seems extremely confusing at first but slows down after the first two episodes.  The first DVD is very interesting and yes, many questions are left unanswered.  If you're a person that dosen't like that then why do you even like anime?  And as much as I HATED ADV's treatment of Evangelion they did a great job with RahXephon.  The box art is wonderful and the booklet inserted is really neat.  The English voice acting while not near as good as Bebop's(the best) is not near as horrible as Evangelion's(oh god my ear's hurt).  Still I watch it in Japanese.  Needless to say, I have high hopes for this series.
ONTO THE COMPARISON
Okay where do I start, the only weakness of Rahxephon is it's many smilarities and borrowed ideas from Evangelion.  I'll say this, if you like Eva then you'll probably like this even though I haven't seen but the first DVD.  Fire away.  Okay the first episode is much like Eva's because the main character is trapped in a city at war.  The dolems stink of ""angel"".  Reika is very mysterious and quiet like a certain blue haired Eva pilot.  Haruka is too much like Misato in fact Ayato ends up in a situation with her and her cute little sister much like Shinji did with Misato(trying to hint not spoil).  A drop of water falls into a pool of water just like in Eva.  When Rahxephon is activated in one of the episodes it's eyes roll around creepily like Unit-01's when it's headcasing came off.  The imagery is what really gets it.  In the 4th episode of Rahxephon a dolem attacks at sea and the whole occurence is way too much like the Eva episode where Asuka is introduced.  Regardless Rahxephon has a lot of unique things going for it.  What sets RahXephon apart is the character's are not as [messed] up as Eva's are which gives it a different flavor.  Hopefully, it will pull away and leave us with the same impression Eva did.  I want it to succeed.  And lots of times great art tends to borrow.",1052870400,2,2983,4.503731343283582
1827159,5,B0000844JY,"The concept of this series is what caught and held my attention. The story starts with Ayata (the main male character) going about his daily life thinking nothing is wrong with the world and quickly the story strips him of everything he thought he new. The story deals with a lot of emotional themes with isolation from everything you knew or loved being (in my opinion) the strongest in the first five episodes. The great thing about this series is that even though this is about as far from reality as ""The Matrix"" is, the themes are universal in that most people can relate to the characters as they try in a very human way to deal with each situation as it arises.
I mention ""The Matrix"" because there are a lot of points that almost seem to be taken from the movie if you watch for them.
The question at this point is what is the Forbidden Song and who is Reika (and how come she doesn't have a reflection).
The Robots (dolems, etc) are the focus in a almost secondary way so far and shouldn't be compared to other Anime that has robots or mechs. The RahXephon doesn't carry any guns or missiles and uses light and sound (and fists) as its primary weapons.
This coupled with great art and good music make this a must.",1051574400,2,1222,4.364035087719298
1827160,5,B0000844JY,"This show is simply beautiful - and so far refreshingly intelligent.  It's stylish and solid too with none of the jaded, bored, we're-too-cool-for-words feeling of Cowboy Bebop.  The overall designs are wonderful, the color pallet is subtle and effective, the music fitting to both mood and purpose and very listenable on it's own - which I can't say for most anime shows. (Winces at the memory of wildly inappropriate 'Rurouni Kenshin' title songs)  The mood is atmospheric and almost dreamlike at times.  All the characters are intriguing with just enough catch to their actions to make you want to know more yet are being allowed to develop slowly.  It's nice to not have what often ultimately turns out to be most of the character development and plot stuffed down your throat in the first few episodes (okay, I've got my fingers crossed on that one since I don't know for certain!).  And while the main character may be a 'stranger in a strange land' type, he still remains likable.  He whines only a little at being torn from the only life he's ever known and told his entire life before was a lie - yet he doesn't seem to buy into his 'rescuers' ways whole-heartedly either.  They've put together an intriguing storyline that I sincerely hope continues to hold up.  Mysteriously motivated alien invaders, global war, giant robot suits and one boy with the key to saving the world... not exactly original material, but the handling of it in RahXephon so far is tantalzing and mysterious.  The end of this disk leaves you defintely wanting to know more!
For once, too, the dub actors so far have done a decent job and the dub script seems faithful.  I far prefer watching my anime in the original Japanese with subtitles, but the dub crew on this one isn't bad.  I can listen to them without wincing in pain, at least *grin* - and that's high praise from me, considering one of my all-time favorite seiyuu, Toshihiko Seki, voices one of the characters!
I've read the comparisons between RahXephon and Neon Genesis Evangelion but since I've never seen Evangelion, I can't make a real judgement, but I do think RahXephon deserves to stand on it's own.  The mecha genre wasn't begun with Evangelion and it certainly didn't end with it.  I must admit I've mainly avoided Evangelion because I've heard the main character is pretty unlikable.  However, there's no problem with that here.  Ayato is sympathetic without being [too bad]; a boy just trying to understand the strange war he's suddenly been thrust into the middle of as a key player when he didn't even know there was a war going on anymore.
And I, for one, am eagerly awaiting the next DVD release.",1051488000,3,2659,4.7229437229437226
1827161,5,B0000844JY,"This has become a very promising year for US releases of anime.  Most of the new issues are at least interesting, and a select few are serious contenders.  RahXephon is one of the latter, combining some tried and true story lines with enough original thinking to seem fresh and original.
Sometimes I think Evangelion is the most borrowed from anime ever produced.  Many of the results are unsatisfactory because the original set such a high standard that failures are glaring.  Not so the case with RahXephon - rather than borrow, it echoes the old themes in an original context.  Sure enough, a teen-aged boy (Ayato) finds himself in the middle of an attack on Tokyo and is led to the mystical temple where a giant egg contains RahXephon, who is a very aesthetic combination of EVA 01 and Gundam Wing.  And giant space creatures (Dolems) appear in the skies for RahXephon to conquer.
But for each similarity, there are differences.  Ayato is a much more vivid character than Shinji.  After the first battle, Ayato and the robot catapult outside of the 'hidden' Tokyo.  Where Ayato discovers that the city he though was all that was left of the world was really the last stronghold of the alien Mu, who plan the earth.  They have locked themselves behind a time barrier in what is now called Tokyo Jupiter.
Ayato's friends have echoes as well - the reticent Reika Mishima who links him with RahXephon,  Haruka Shitow - part special agent and part softie.  And there is also the stern head of TERRA operations, Jin Kunugi.  But despite the parallels, they these new efforts have different and richer personalities than their precursors.  And there are many others to fill out the cast.  It is clear that relationships will play as important a part in the story as the combat scenes, where 'song' is a weapon.
If the first five installments are any indication, the artwork and character design are outstanding.  And true to a series where sound is a weapon, the music (by Khiko Hashimoto) is memorable.  The story is carefully paced, but the viewer is treated to an active and often beautiful film surface.  Mecha and mystical are mixed together seamlessly.  This is a work that stands on its own quite well, but I think that Evangelion fans will be especially pleased.
I am not as excited with the set box and t-shirt, though.  I like gimmicks, but while the packaging is pretty, it is not as solid as it should be.  And the t-shirt is a bit average.  Be warned that, if you are not a collector, the DVD alone is probably a better purchase.",1050969600,12,2539,4.658426966292135
1827162,5,B0000844JY,"""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""
Since I'm not particularly good at reviews, I'll make this easy on you and I, and just divide it into two categories.
Episodes:
The first five episodes of the 26-ep series are on the first (of seven) DVD. The animation is crisp, bright, sharp, clean, colorful, vibrant, and all those other adjectives that people use to describe great animation. The character designs are also very nice, as are the mecha (I especially love the Allegretto). On to the storyline: even though these are only the first episodes, they aren't afraid to get into the mysteries right away. It already seems like the plot is revving up to something, and we're only 5 episodes in. I hope the feeling crescendos (no pun intended) all the way through the series.
The English dubbing was handled very well, too. Megumi and Haruka's voices sound kinda... odd when they yell or have very high-pitched lines, though. Otherwise, a very solid dub. The Japanese cast is very, very nice too. Music is above average as well. ""Hemisphere"" and ""Yume no Tamago,"" the opening and ending themes, respectively, both fit the show well, and so does the vast majority of the background music.
Extras:
The extras on the disc are sparse, but good. Other than Cowboy Bebop, this is the only series that I've appreciated the clean openings-closings for. The Japanese trailer was very cool too. The liner notes were very nice as well. The character sketches, info bites and interviews were a nice touch, and the first and last pages of the notes looked very cool with the different type of paper.
Since I bought the Special Edition DVD, I also got a nice box for the series, and a T-Shirt. The box is... well, a box. The art on it is very nice, though. The shirt is pretty cool, too. It's just your basic white XL T-Shirt, with the artwork from the DVD cover on it, only RahXephon is in black and white instead of color. My one gripe is that the way the image is printed, it doesn't seem like it will stand up to too many washings before it starts to ""crack"". So wear it sparingly.
All in all, a great first DVD for what is shaping up to be a great series. I can't wait until May.",1050969600,,2188,4.527777777777778

But, this is a horrible show and I feel compelled to let people know before they waste time in this.  BTW, I grew up watching Japanese animation like Robotech, which I loved.  I had high hopes after reading some reviews, but after a few episodes I started to wonder about all the hype - they are unfounded. Still, I pressed on and finished episode 15. At this point I have had it. I am not going to waste more time on this.
Here are the awards this show earned from me:
1. Same plot award: almost every episode is about the clueless boy pilots the mecha and magically defeats the enemy with some kind of emotional outburst.
2. Dumbest enemy award: The enemy, after a dozen of so attempts, keep on sending 1 single golem at a time for the boy and his mecha to be defeated.  This is obviously done so that the boy could learn about who he is and develop his full potential.
3. Way over-the-top drama award: many characters are overly passive aggressive, especially the main character. This is a tiresome technique and gives audience a feeling of watching little brats getting their own way
4. We can't tell you the background award: after 15 episodes you'd think you find out something about why the alien and humans are fighting. Nope.
5. No cool mecha fight award: if you want to see cool mecha fights then you will be disappointed. The hero usually is the ends the fight in 1 blow

There are so many other awards this show earns from me but I really need to spend any more time on it.",1499990400,3,1517,4.365248226950355

7978963,1,B0000844JY,"The story is like an acid trip to the end. Characters are fleshed out well but there is no satisfactory back story, no foundation of why such and such things need to unfold.

The whole series shows the various offensive and counter offensive moves between the USFDA and TERRA against an inter dimensional group of beings called the ""MU"" or ""Mulians"" There genetics is supposedly similar to humans but differ physically due to the presence of blue blood in them.

TERRA is a private organisation supported and formed by ""The Foundation"". In the year 2025 or thereabouts,  Tokyo is encapsulated by a barrier and is now called Tokyo Jupiter. The main character is a young man, aged 17, named Ayoto who escapes this place with the help of a Federation intelligence officer Haruka.

The so called plot moves from there. It is sort of a mecha / magic trip where Ayoto comes to control a giant ""Xephon"". All his battles have to do with fighting ""Dolems"" controlled by the ""Mu"". The dolems are basically ""golems"" controlled mystically by thew singing of the Mulians. The Dolems are named after musical notations like Allegretto and Fortissimo, while the backdrop of the Mulian history has a tint of Meso-American.
Ayoto stumbles across to win these fights without really having any idea how to control the Xephon.

So many plot inconsistencies exist just because the person watching has to guess and find out the ""why"" of everything, much less the ""what"". The series progresses without much explanation as to why the Mu and the Earth forces are actually fighting or why the Mu are actually here. Do they need humans for any purpose? Why, if they are inter dimensional beings, are they on earth for whatever they were planning to do? There is no back story on Ayoto or about his grandfather, father, mother, etc. We come to realize they exist, on a side note, of no significance later in the series. All the while Ayoto is the clueless protagonist in this tale. What one sees in the end is some real ""matrix"" like situation where the audience is left to their own devices to piece everything together.

I had real hopes for this series and expected it to be different from the normal mecha genre. I was wrong. All the top reviews here go on about art and story line. In my opinion the story line is fractured, incomplete, and unfulfilling. The art is all about trying to create some kind of ""awe"" in the audience which, unfortunately the series completely fails to carry the plot with.

Pros:
1. Good characterization
2. Some lighthearted moments
3. Great music
4. I dare say a bit philosophical.

Cons:
1. Unfulfilling story.
2. Does not develop a connection with both parties as to their ultimate purpose.
3. So many missed opportunities to explain and flesh out the story.
4. Somehow, I feel, the writer Yutaka Izubuchi wanted to showcase more of his artistic style of anime with whatever philosophy hew was trying to assimilate into this series.

This is my take. I am all for artistic ways of rendering a story but watching this was a chore. I watched faithfully to the end to make sure I understand the story and give a complete opinion.

In conclusion, art for arts sake, this series only achieves the writers` ideology without creating any justification to the story.",1496880000,6,3266,4.724077328646748

All anime on Amazon are English dubbed. It's disgusting.",1496188800,,197,4.794117647058823
