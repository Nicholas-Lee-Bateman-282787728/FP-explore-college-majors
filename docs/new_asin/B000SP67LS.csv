8206215,4,B000SP67LS,"Salvador Sanchez never gave a bad fight in his tragically truncated life. Salvador Sanchez was in fact one of the most exciting boxers to have ever laced them up. This DVD gives us his two fantastic fights against durable, hard-hitting Danny ""Little Red"" Lopez, the guy he won the WBC Featherweight Championship from (and when Sanchez won this belt, he never relinquished it). It's kinda funky that the DVD kicks off with the rematch, instead of with the first fight. But let's go chronologically.

On February 2, 1980, in Phoenix, Arizona, on the CBS network (because back then boxing WAS popular, dammit), 21-year-old Salvador Sanchez got his shot at the title against the champ Danny Lopez. And despite that wonky Ron Jeremy 'stache, ""Little Red"" was no joke. Lopez was a tremendous, come ahead puncher and Sanchez, with his big funky mop of hair and tassels on his pretty white boots, had his work cut out for him. Lest people forget - because Sanchez was himself very aggressive - Sanchez could box, and plenty of times he utilized good in-and-out movement to befuddle Lopez. He demonstrated great discipline and poise for a 21-year-old, and one thing about Sanchez was that you could never tell if he got hurt or not. In the ring he consistently displayed this impassive face, and a wooden cigar store Indian showed more expression.

Sanchez's precise punching - and, more tellingly, his lead rights - soon got Lopez all cut up. Cuts over both eyes for Lopez, and a face that was soon rendered into this bleeding, swolled up mask. Danny Lopez looked like an uglier version of himself (not that he was a heartthrob to begin with). I think even his eyelashes were bleeding. Sanchez himself got cut over his left eye and was bleeding from the nose, but his sitch wasn't nearly as desperate as Lopez's. Give the champ credit, he wasn't a quitter and he kept plodding forward and even scored well at times, always had that puncher's chance. But Sanchez wore him down and hurt him several times, even though he never did go down. In the thirteenth round, when a devastating combination by Sanchez propelled a dazed Lopez into the ropes, well, that spelled the end for his reign as featherweight champion. And the torch passed on to Salvador Sanchez, by virtue of technical knockout.

The rematch was fought in Las Vegas a few months later, on June 21, 1980 and on the ABC network - and it was just about a carbon copy of the first fight, maybe with less blood and with Sanchez boxing even more smartly. It would take a round longer, but with similar results. Lopez was still as game as anything, but Sanchez remained in control and easily gave as much as and often better than what he got. Yet again Sanchez showed off his clever in the ring, demonstrating intelligent ring generalship and a volatile arsenal that turned ""Little Red"" Lopez into ""A Lot Red"" Lopez.

Again, there wasn't much in the way of clinches, to the joy of you and me and referee Mills Lane. Mills Lane pretty much stayed in the background, where all good referees should be. That is, until the 14th round, when a particularly punishing flurry from Sanchez forced Lane to step in and call the thing off. Lopez deployed a hard head and a granite chin against Salvador Sanchez, but the guy was simply taking too much punishment. ""Little Red"" retired soon after, and would only unretire years and years later (and would get KO'd early for his troubles).

The quality of the images on this DVD isn't bad, if you relish grainy, uncrisp images. The picture frankly looks like a copy of a copy of a copy of a VHS tape, so be warned. It's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, instead of 5. The fight commentaries are in English, with the first fight featuring the broadcast team of Tim Ryan, Angelo Dundee and, in round eight, Sugar Ray Leonard very briefly donning the headset for a few comments. I'm not quite sure who commentates in the second fight, but it was also nicely done. The DVD closes with a featured piece on Salvador Sanchez, with the narrative held in Spanish. It mentions his signature fights with Lopez, Wilfredo Gomez, and with Azumah Nelson. As his fans would know, Sanchez's grueling bout with Nelson would be his last, as months later he would lose his life in a car crash, still shy of 24 years old. I forget in which of these two fights that this following was said, but there's an ironic, bittersweet feeling that wells up now when that one commentator matter-of-factly states about Salvador Sanchez: ""He looks like one of the Mexican fighters that'll be around for a long time.""
