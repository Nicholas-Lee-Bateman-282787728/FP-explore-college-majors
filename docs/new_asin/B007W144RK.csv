5112276,5,B007W144RK,"as this aussie series goes, it would be hard to imagine a better written, cast, or acted....not to mention extremely entertaining series.  'season 2' is currently airing on DirecTV on their audience channel.  worth every penny. very witty, clever, and honesty prevails even for the very self aware screw up that Clever Greene is portrayed as.  I don't want to give it away so and any more from me would be either just gushing or superfluous. worth every penny!",1349395200,9,460,4.7974683544303796
5112277,5,B007W144RK,"Cleaver Greene has issues.  A lot of issues.  And his issues get him into trouble.  A lot of trouble.

Cleaver is a very smart and talented barrister who can take literally any case and run with it to grab a win regardless of how unusual his client or the circumstances of the case.  The subject matter for his cases in this first season have ranged from a cannibal killer to a respectable doctor having been charged with bestiality.  There are mobsters, prostitutes, teachers with questionable ethics, diplomats and politicians that add more color to this series than you could see in any art gallery!

Richard Roxburgh does a brilliant job bringing Cleaver Greene to life.  The character is charming and entertaining.  One minute, you truly sympathize with him and the next you can change your mind because it's blatantly clear the trouble he's in was of his own making.  He has more than a small problem with gambling and drugs and often finds himself taking a good bashing from stand over man Col (Steve Le Marquand) and answering to Col's boss, Mick Corella (Richard Carter).  Cleave manages to estrange himself from his long time best friend Barney ""Barnyard"" Meagher (Russell Dykstra) and his wife Scarlett (Danielle Cormack) after making a huge mistake with the latter.  Cleaver is more than a little bit fond of Melissa ""Missy"" Partridge, a former prostitute.  Cleave and his ex wife, Wendy (Caroline Brazier) have their hands full with their teenage son Finnegan ""Fuzz"" who is having an affair with one of his teachers.  Sadly, the poor lad loses the love of his life when said teacher leaves him for a younger man!

The series was created by Richard Roxburgh, Peter Duncan and Charles Waterstreet.  Andrew Knight, along with co-creator Peter Duncan serve as the writers for the series.  Duncan and Knight are the perfect writing team as they have successfully created a show that is entertaining, full of complicated ups and downs, sprinkled with just the right amount of humor to lighten the serious moments but not to come off as silly and is populated by multi-faceted characters who are realistic, lovable and despicable.  Some of the humor is subtle such as Cleaver calling David Potter ""Harry"" but all of it is laugh-out-loud great.

Casting was inspired.  Fans of Aussie television will recognize many faces in Rake.  International viewers should all be familiar to some extent with Roxburgh through such films as Moulin Rouge!, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Van Helsing.  Even someone who is seeing Rake as an introduction to Australian television will soon find themselves wanting to see more from the cast in this series.

Matt Day (David ""Harry"" Potter) can be seen in Underbelly:  The Golden Mile, Tangle and the soon-to-air Reef Doctors.  Steve Le Marquand (Col) took the lead as Tony Piccolo in Small Time Gangster.  Adrienne Pickering is noticeable from Home and Away.  Russell Dykstra has appeared on such hit Aussie shows as Wild Boys, Blackjack, and Spirited.  The amazingly beautiful Daniella Cormack who is quickly making a huge name for herself is recognizable from Xena:  Warrior Princess, City Homicide, East West 101, Underbelly: Razor and, most recently, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.  Noting was spared with the casting of guest actors, as well.  Lisa McCune (Sea Patrol), Sacha Horler (Small Time Gangster, Offspring & Crownies), Damon Herriman (Love My Way, Breaking Bad, Wilfred and Justified) and Richard Carter (East West 101, City Homicide and White Collar Blue) are all top-notch in their roles.  There are also some real gems making guest appearances.  David Field (Water Rats, City Homicide, Wild Boys, Blackjack) makes an appearance in episode four as a man accused of the murder of a 15 year old boy.  As with everything he is in, Field delivers a powerful performance worthy of award.  One of my very favorite actors, award winning and multi-nominated Sam Neill shines as Dr. Bruce Chandler in episode five.  The regular cast of Rake PLUS Sam Neill.  Could it get any better than that?  I think not!

I don't believe viewers from the United States should have any problems adapting to this being an Australian series.  There isn't too much Aussie slang in the dialogue and from the legal standpoint, the atmosphere of the show is almost like watching an episode of Law & Order except the lawyers wear wigs and robes, as well as the judge.  Minutes into the first episode, American viewers should feel right at home and comfortable with their surroundings and really enjoy the series.  I personally think this series as as strong, if not stronger, than any series on American television.  Rake can hold its own against the likes of Law & Order, Breaking Bad, Monk, Republic of Doyle (Canadian, and another excellent show I highly recommend) and White Collar.

Rake began airing on ABC1 in November 2010 with the first season containing eight episodes.  ABC1 commissioned a second series of Rake which began production in April 2012.  A date has yet to be given for the second series premiere but I am assuming since Rake was a summer series the first time around (November is summer in Australia) it will be the same for series two.  If so, November can't get here fast enough for this viewer!

If you are a fan of well written, smart, very unique story lines and characters who are all over the personality map and delivered by some of Australia's finest then you will most definitely enjoy Rake.  It's a series that I hope has a long and healthy life on Aussie television so that it will have a long and healthy life on DVD here in the States!",1340668800,28,5607,4.876321353065539

5112285,5,B007W144RK,"As one who was brought up on the best of British TV from the 50s,60s and 70s I have been saddened by the slow decline which has taken place since those times. In North America we have little opportunity to enjoy the offerings from Down Under yet there I am finding the high quality dramas which they just don't make anymore. ""Rake"" is a superb example of this new trend. Richard Roxburgh the lead actor as well as co-creator and producer carries us through each episode with a breathtaking performance. He is supported by a wonderful cast of regulars and special guests who all match their characters flawlessly. There is not a weak link among them.
This is an outstanding series which I would rank very highly with some of the BBC classics. There is an obvious resemblance to the beloved Rumpole character but Cleaver Green is much more than this. Thanks to Roxburgh he takes us from hilarious comedy to gut wrenching despair in a heartbeat and back. Take a chance with this. Watch the first couple of episodes and I believe you will be firmly hooked.",1444348800,6,1052,4.601063829787234

The Aussies have created interesting characters in clever stories with devilishly delightful dialogue - I actually laugh out loud.  This is the 2010 first series with 8  ~:50 min episodes;  can't wait to see series 2 and 3 and I hope they make more.",1424908800,,397,4.850746268656716

Its main character is just as self destructive as say, Robbie Coltrane's Cracker except this guy gives us a lighter trip. He does get saved in the last minutes (although you never believe he will be), but the series is not bland or superficial. The characters are eccentric and unpredictable, but believable and genuine and the plots include the right mix of private lives vs. trial case melodrama.

5112293,5,B007W144RK,"Rake is 18th century slang for a dissolute person.  Hogarth painted a series of paintings called The Rakes Progress (progress means something like a spiritual voyage) showing the decline of a rake.  This in turn was a reference to a 17th century story, Pilgrims Progress about the rewards of Christian virtue.

This version of the Rakes Progress is set in modern Australia.  The rake is a barrister (lawyer) with addictions to sex, alcohol, cocaine and gambling.  He also dances circles around the lawyers who oppose him.  His brilliance lies in the fact that he is utterly genuine, that is, devoid of bulls***.  He wreaks havoc in the lives of those around him, but they all love him, as you will too.

The stories are hilarious.  I cannot recall laughing so hard so often.  Seasons 1 and 2 are available on demand from Netflix.  At the end of Season 2 the rake winds up in jail and things look grim.  It is like those cliffhangers from the 1930s which end with the heroine lying on the railway tracks, and in order to find out what happens you have pay for the next episode in the series.  The dastardly people at Netflix did not include Season 3, either via streaming or as a DVD.  About all one can do is buy the CDs, as I did from Amazon.com.  You will also.

I discovered Rake having watched Unfinished Sky, a great movie.  The director of Unfinished Sky, Peter Duncan, also directed Rake.",1417824000,,1395,4.538152610441767

5112295,5,B007W144RK,"I was totally caught off guard by the quality of this show- had not even known of its existence prior to its Australian demise and American, short lived, reprise.

I am not a lawyer or legal expert, and am not up to date on Australian politics, so I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the legal issues Cleaver Greene's courtroom arguments and histrionics, and the way Australian politics are portrayed, but to be honest, I don't care.  I do know that there are some wickedly funny, and sometimes absurd (in a good way) plots, wonderful actors, and some genuinely touching moments in this show.

Richard Roxburgh is amazing, and his Cleaver Greene, stands, in my mind, as one of the great characters of television history.  I actually feel sorry for Greg Kinnear having to follow Roxburgh and attempt to portray the character in the American version of the show- there was some kind of organic bond between Roxburgh and Greene that could not be reproduced.

The other actors are wonderful, and the scripts allow their characters to be fleshed out.  The best TV shows usually seem to ""care"" for their characters, even if they are sometimes portrayed in unflattering ways, and I felt that the writers of Rake cared for the various people who revolved around, and were frequently hurt in one way or another by Cleaver Greene

My only quibble with the this DVD set, and one which would cause me to give the DVD set 4.5 stars, If I could, is that there are no subtitles at all.  I found, while watching the show, that there were sometimes lines or words I could not understand, and even though I speak English, I would have liked some subtitles to help me understand the version of English Australians speak.

I would recommend that if you like sharp and witty dialogue, excellent scripts, and some memorable acting and characters, you see this show if you are able to- and I mean all 3 seasons.",1414281600,3,1891,4.654654654654655

5112299,5,B007W144RK,So funny and raucous and titalating.  Richard Roxburgh is a hoot and all the characters with him.  Australian version is best--not so much censorship as US.,1404691200,,156,4.961538461538462
5112300,5,B007W144RK,"It's been years since a tv show made me laugh as long and hard as the first few episodes of Rake did. Serious laughter! Roxburgh's truly genius portrayal of Cleaver is legendary, especially in this first season while it's all still fresh and hasn't gone soap yet, which it does in the  next two seasons. Cleaver Greene is based on Rox's friend and series co-creator Charles Waterstreet, an Ozzie barrister famous for similar exploits (his Australian newspaper columns are occasionally hilarious, look them up). But CW is no CG, whose political incorrectness is near total satire yet so deliciously funny. And Roxburgh is absolutely dead on at every moment here; his timing is exquisite, as are his micro-expressions. He can milk a brief glance like few others, as his over-the-top Dracula in Van Helsing showed, but this is clearly his comedic masterpiece.

His foil is perfectly played by Dykstra, who emerges as the other best actor in Rake as the season goes on, and who highlights how truly unhinged his partner is. For sheer humor, this show never gets better than its first episode, where Hugo Weaving is perfection as an unassuming cannibal who can't see what all the fuss is about. The many ironies inherent in the way our meat-loving society is horrified by the idea of recycling ourselves are played to the hilt here. The genius of Rake, especially in the early part of the first season before it took off in Australia and they predictably started playing it a bit safer, is its gleeful skewering of humanity's moral and ethical hypocrisies. Cleaver's love of prostitution and blow and dissolution in general is juxtaposed with his caring nature to produce a painfully real protagonist-antihero, and once you start cheering for him it all blurs into a new realm of happily uncomfortable hilarity.

I had no trouble understanding the various Aussie accents (though there are almost no Bruces, Sheilas or g'days, let alone shrimps on the barbie), and there are subtitles for certain political references other countries might not be familiar with. Sydney sure looks like a lovely city. O you lucky folks! One of the bonuses of this show is seeing how a similar but different society to the US and Europe operates...though sadly it appears corruption is endemic to mankind.

As the season moves along, and more so as the second season gets going, romantic affairs take more precedence, and thus the real barbs of morality humor lessen. Which is why the first half of this season is where it's at for Rake; by the end of the series in season three, the somewhat real feel of this season has faded to pure tv goofiness. But here at the beginning, we get a surreally close examination of our daily fakeness in the weird world of laws we've created for ourselves, and Roxburgh's charisma and comic timing is at its best.

I'd put his performance in the first few episodes of Rake up there with most any dramedy acting in cinema or the small screen of the past decade; the first disc of this dvd set will get plenty of play in my player as the years go by, because they caught some lightning in the bottle at the start of this unique show.

One thing that gets better as the three seasons play out is Matt Day. He starts off as a buffoon and gently coaxes his character into a surprising amount of pathos while maintaining the humor. Damien Garvey is the other dark horse who shines later on, getting funnier by the show as he becomes the main pricker of ethical balloons. Caroline Brazier might be the quietest MVP while she lets everyone pivot around her. The only performance that isn't spot on is occasionally Pickering, who seems out of her league at points, indeed almost out of character as she seems to marvel at how funny Roxburgh is instead of inhabiting the scenes with him. But even that can't stop Cleaver from emerging non-victorious! His joy in messing up is a beautiful thing.

The extras are nothing special...because there are none! Booooo! I would have liked an hour of bloopers...there must have been lots of good ones.

If you love Python or other heavily ironic black humor, you've got to give this first season of Rake a try. It's an all-time classic.",1404518400,,4176,4.734525447042641

5112302,5,B007W144RK,"Although the characters and story lines are slightly different, both the American and the original Australian versions are a lot of fun to watch.  I bought the Australian series 1 and 2 because I was enjoying the American production when myFox TV decided to drop it after a few episodes.  In truth, while the American cast did a great job, the writers and producers didn't need to rewrite and re-film the story.  The American cast should have been given an original story line of their own because they were all good at their craft.

Rake's main character, a defending attorney named Cleaver Greene, has plenty of character flaws and he can't stay out of trouble, but he has a good heart and is loved and hated by the people in his life, especially those who are dear to him.  I enjoyed the episodes so much that I can't wait until series 3 comes out on dvd.  Series 1 and 2 each has 8 delightful episodes.",1402531200,,906,4.460606060606061

In my experience, the American versions rarely live up to the original versions (with the exception of ""The Office"").  And this original series is much funnier.  I have no objection to what Americans consider ""bad"" or ""foul"" language and some of the topics might be a little over the top for the American market.  The episode ""Rake versus Chandler"" is hysterically funny BTW.",1395532800,,483,4.91358024691358
5112305,5,B007W144RK,"I discovered Rake a year or two ago.  I immediately fell in love with the show.  Rake is a legal dramedy.  An incredible legal dramedy.  It reminds me a little bit of the early seasons of Boston Legal, back when Shatner and Spader were morally-ambiguous lawyers fighting the good fight, before David E. Kelly turned the show into being about his own personal political agenda.

But I digress.

First of all, gotta love the accents.  I mean, really - I might watch the show just for the accents alone.  And for Richard Roxburgh.  He brings the character of keegan deane to life.  Keegan is a loveably misanthropic lawyer.  He deserves everything that comes his way.  He is challenging and impossible to live with - but somehow he makes you want to love him because of his flaws, not in spite of them.  The supporting cast is great (although I don't love Scarlett - but that may have more to do wtih her character than with the actress).

I totally recommend watching this show if you can.  It's so much smarter than half - nay, three quarters - of what we have on our side of the Pacific.",1393459200,,1087,4.446700507614213

5112307,5,B007W144RK,"This series is comedic drama, and when it is comedic, it's rolling on the floor funny. Paul Cleaver Greene, played by Richard Roxburgh, is a barrister in the Australian Bar, with a boatload of personal problems that makes his life a tragi-comic juggling act of multiple crises in his life. Greene has 2 ex-wives, one a barrister, the other a private practice psychologist, whose teenage son, fathered by Cleaver, is in high school, with exploding hormones, and a penchant for getting involved with older women. He has a secretary who embezzles from him, ongoing tax problems with the government, in love with a hooker, and owes bookies hundreds of thousands of dollars. This still doesn't cover all of his problems. At times he has a cocaine addiction, imbibes alcohol too much, and runs his mouth at the most inopportune moments. He's on a first name basis with his bookies muscle, who dispenses the occasional  beating when Cleaver falls behind in his payments. This leads one to wonder how on earth did this guy get to be a barrister? But in the courtroom is where this guy shines. He is brilliant, though disheveled in dress, and appearance, and usually in need of a shave, he is the master of the cross examination. He's a defender of the accused lowlife's of society: drug dealers, murderers, thieves and anyone who has enough cash to pay his fees. After watching the first two seasons, I'm eagerly awaiting the release date of the third season. I've just heard that there's going to be an American spin-off the this series, which I don't see how it can even remotely compare to the Richard Roxburgh series.

This series is one of the best Australian series I've seen, personally. So good you won't want to stop watching it. Very relatable. I think we all have a bit of Cleaver Greene in us.",1529884800,,332,4.55

8522395,5,B007W144RK,"Who us?  Problems?  NO WAY!  My hubby and I were in sheer bliss watching seasons one and two of Rake as Richard Roxburgh, the ever-rascally Cleaver Greene, faced crisis after crisis, most of which were of his own making.  Our problems were NOTHING compared to this weasel of a barrister's daily grind!  Yes, we escaped into a delightful Australian, aka South Wales, fantasy world nightly, over the course of several weeks, and it was truly our guilty little pleasure to do so!  The writers of the series fully developed each character of the ensemble cast into a multi-faceted human being, with true strengths and weaknesses, unlike the one-dimensional characters of most American-made television shows.  I would buy season 3 and 4 in a heartbeat if I could find versions that would play on American DVD players.  Oh, PLEASE, Amazon, offer season 3 and 4 for sale, or at least let us RENT the seasons 3 and 4 . . . please don't leave us hanging out on a limb like this . . . awe, be a mate, won't ya?",1491004800,,1000,4.516666666666667
