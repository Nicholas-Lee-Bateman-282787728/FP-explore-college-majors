He's at his young hep cat best in this number, which makes it obvious why he became a superstar.  He's just sensational, so charismatic.  Even this early in his career, 1959 at age 23, he was polished and assured.  But then he was sorta known for these very qualities.",1136419200,3,418,4.3896103896103895
1004147,5,6305272131,"I consider that ""Pepe"" is a very good film. I have seen it at least 4 times, but it was long time ago. I would like to have it in DVD version.",1115251200,13,142,3.46875
1004148,4,6305272131,"The last time I watched Pepe I was very young.  This movie was entertaining, funny, and in good taste.  I think most everyone will enjoy this movie.",1032739200,11,148,4.444444444444445
1004149,4,6305272131,I remember seeing this movie when I was growing up. I've only been able to find this film on VHS only in Spanish. I would like to beable to find one in English. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it.,953424000,18,205,3.9047619047619047
1004150,5,6305272131,"Pepe is a flimsy story meant to showcase a bunch of Columbia's stars...and it succeeds. Cameos abound and it's fun to ""count the stars"" as they pass through the story line - especially Greer Garson playing herself,  as Mrs. Buddy Fogelson! Most of these stars are gone now, and it's a  pleasure seeing them in their heyday. Cantinflas is his usual original  self, and the music is fun too!",933033600,8,389,4.608695652173913
7886731,3,6305272131,"Hollywood heaven; variety show has a lot to offer. There's even a little bible lesson on love by Edgar G. Robinson. Nothing too bad happens to anyone. Underappreciated in it's time. My tape runs barely 160 minutes. Look like it's become a rarity as it didn't go over big on video, a dvd release wouldn't seem to be forthcoming.",1491264000,,327,4.559322033898305

7886733,5,6305272131,"I sort of feel like pinching myself, because I never thought I would like this & the critics seemed not to think this was great. When I saw this jazz dance number with great musical accompaniment I just sat down and watched the rest with absolute contentment.
I have to admit I found the 'loser drunk director character' of the story annoying. But the terrific musical numbers, singing, endless parade of some of the best talent of the time effortlessly kept me smiling. In the age of hip-hop, salsa, Sonic Youth (all of which I love) this still was a joy to watch. Like a lost jewel, forget the critics & follow your feelings, enjoy!",1402704000,,634,4.521739130434782
7886734,5,6305272131,Wow! surprised.... I got it in DVD format plus a free movie. Actually 2 free movies... Down side don't have a DVD. So had to set up a computer at that persons house so they could watch it. Wish I got it VHS or at least told me.,1398384000,,227,3.75
7886735,3,6305272131,"Here's another very entertaining film from 1960 that Columbia (Sony Releasing) has forgotten about.  The original running time when first released in roadshow reserved seat format was 195 minutes.  That version played New York, Los Angeles and a few other larger cities.  Columbia then cut almost 40 minutes from the film for the rest of country and that version is the only version available.  However, I'm sure that the 40 missing minutes can be found in the Sony vaults somewhere.  This picture needs to be restored to it's original length and released on DVD and Blu Ray.  The problem is will Sony incur the expense of doing so.",1379462400,5,632,4.805555555555555
7886736,5,6305272131,"This movie MUST be made into a DVD.  If anyone knows of one, please notify me.  This is one of the silliest, saddest, happiest, most wonderful movies of all time.  Completely underrated.  DVD PLEASE!",1377648000,2,199,4.764705882352941
7886737,3,6305272131,"Some friends and I saw this film back in the early 1960s, when it was first released, and we really enjoyed it.  Besides providing another chance to see the wonderful comic actor Cantinflas in an English language film, there were many wonderful cameos by some of the biggest stars in Hollywood.  Judy Garland didn't appear onscreen but she recorded a song for the film; the following year she finally appeared in her first film in seven years: ""Judgement at Nuremburg.""  I remember that we enjoyed see Shirley Jones in the film; she was always a pretty and very sweet lady, who appeared in several major musical films and who later had quite a following when she starred on the television series ""The Partridge Family.""

One can only hope that the film will be available again on DVD.  There was apparently a limited release of the film.  Undoubtedly, the critics weren't kind to the film, which had a rather lightweight story, and it didn't do terribly well at the box office.  Nevertheless, it would likely be wonderful to see again, providing yet another ""time capsule"" of Hollywood's golden age.",1270166400,6,1099,4.8138297872340425

7886739,5,6305272131,"George Sidney, one of Hollywood's most underrated directors, never made an awful film, but this one comes close, mostly due to its insufferably cloying use of Cantinflas--one of Mexico's smartest, wittiest movie stars ever--but here you'd think he was a moron, a smiling bobblehead of Mexican folk wisdom and simplicity.

Indeed Cantinflas, as ""Pepe,"" whom you might call the original ""horse whisperer,"" is incredibly good in the movie, which makes it a drag to have to give it a big two thumbs down for political reasons.  He's not playing a Stepin Fetchit EXACTLY, and in fact he's always seen as wiser than the silly norteamericanos who try to patronize him, but the whole thing about he loves the horse so much he calls him ""my son"" (not just once but approximately forty or forty-five times) leaves you grating your teeth.

And also it seems to emasculate Cantinflas who was, like Elvis, super sexy.  Here the movie pokes fun of the way his pants slide low, low, low down his hips.  Au contraire, such ease with undress is one reason why Cantinflas is sex appeal on two legs!  And yet through the whole movie you don't even know if he's in love with Shirley Jones or is he just playing Sancho Panza hoping to get his master, the failed Hollywood director Ted Holt (Dan Dailey), into bed with la Jones--here playing a beat bohemian--and doing it rather well too -- of course she's always good no matter what she does, and George Sidney--who directed many glamor girls into performances of real depth and soul and originality, from Kim Novak to Ann-Margret--gives Shirley Jones what she never had elsewhere, a contemporary pizzazz, like street chic.

When she (or her double) dances in the underground nightclub with Michael Mickey Callan, my pulses were on fire!

But basically the movie is a fantastic treasure trove of forgotten performances and curiosities; let me cite only the amazing dance trio of Dailey, Cantinflas, and Maurice Chevalier in a reprise of ""Mimi"" in a luxurious Mexican nightclub, and at the other end of the spectrum a buzarre, Dali Influenced number in which Pepe and Debbie Reynolds (as herself), dressed in identical ""Mexican"" costumes, tumble out of the mouth of a giant bottle of tequila and perform a drunken, Jack Cole style tumble dance to, yes, ""Tequila.""  PEPE was Eugene Loring's last film, and the dance director/choreographer, who had done everything from FUNNY FACE to YOLANDA AND THE THIEF in the past, here retires with some of his most inventive and convincing dances--in a movie nobody even knows about.  The title number, with Shirley Jones in a dirndl, belting out the song while leading a donkey and three hundred Mexican extras, and Pepe, down a steep traffic filled hill on the narrowest street in the world, has got to be seen to be believed, and you'll still be scratching your head--why?  How?  What?  Where?  When?

Let's bring back PEPE in a big way.  If every man, woman and child in the US and Mexico would see it, I'm convinced that -- well, wait a second-- there might be race riots at the border-- and yet it is an unbelievable compendium of fun.  With Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon (in character in his role in SOME LIKE IT HOT), Ann B. Davis, Greer Garson, Bobby Darin, and Edward G. Robinson.",1172793600,15,3263,4.777580071174377
7886740,4,6305272131,"I admit that this probably isn't a great movie, but I've many great memories of vewing the movie Pepe several times at the theater.  The music was fun and there were many Cameos of some wonderful entertainers who are no longer with us.  I would certainly enjoy reliving some memories with Pepe on DVD.",1153440000,20,301,4.555555555555555
