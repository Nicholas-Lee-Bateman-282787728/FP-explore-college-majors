8002706,4,B0000TPB78,"The movie was Billy Chong's best movie.  The guy has moves and speed.  The only thing that gets lost in this movie is his arranged marriage.  Otherwise, this is a movie for all kung fu enthusists!",1282953600,,196,4.388888888888889
8002707,4,B0000TPB78,"I've been buying Kung Fu flicks for years and stumbled across this little gem at home with the plastic wrapping still on it. I popped some corn, grabbed a Cherry Coke, and ended up thoroughly enjoying myself. Super Power is Saturday afternoon fun with it's cheesy dubbing, shoestring budget, borrowed music, numerous fight scenes, and Jackie Chan inspired mayhem. Oh, and Chiang Tao is one of the main villains. He's always entertaining. Basically, a Manchu fighter challenges the offspring of five masters who defeated his recently deceased father many years before. When he challenges Chong's dad, the already great young master is trained to become even greater and tackle this persistent foe for his old man. The ending is kind of abrupt and a side-plot involving an arranged marriage just disappears but Super Power is still a good time. If Kung Fu is your thing and you don't mind the eighties mullet hairstyles, order a copy and enjoy. It's still selling well so I'm not the only one digging it.",1277596800,2,1002,4.9
