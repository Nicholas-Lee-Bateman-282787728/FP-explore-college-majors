8035112,4,B0002Z8CJO,"It's a good movie--despite being a Canadian production, it could not help smelling very French. It did have suspense and in the end, kind of expected melodrama. I am dissatisfied with the female character though. I mean, what kind of idiot of a man gets to marry a biaatch like that. ha ha. Could not help the previous B word.
The movie did have a question about love--the end definition of it I guess entails being understood and accepted despite of the situation.
Enjoy it. However, if you pass, that won't be too much of a loss either.",1357948800,,538,4.5
8035113,3,B0002Z8CJO,"I wasn't really in the mood for a sub-titled French-Canadian thriller ... I was just browsing through Amazon instant video for a mystery.  But, this sounded interesting, and I'm familiar with Montreal, so I picked WOLVES IN THE SNOW.  And it's really pretty good; I was entertained and interested throughout.

That's not to say that the movie is anything like a Coen Brothers movie (as proposed in a tag-line for the movie).  No, it's nowhere near as strong as even the weakest venture by those Joel and Ethan guys.  But putting the marketing hype aside, this really is a decent little movie; it doesn't look or feel 'lo-budget' and the director does well at 'telling the story' (my first criteria for all films that aren't trying for Fellini or Tarkovsky status).

PROS:  Interesting story, well-acted and paced, though it may be a little slow for the Bruce Willis crowd.  Marie-Jose Croze (Lucie) was particularly good, which is important as she's the only actor that appears in virtually every scene.  I was never entirely sure what the character, Lucie, was thinking or how she was going to respond to the increasing mayhem around her -- and that's probably the biggest factor in the story's success at keeping us interested.

CONS:  The Coen brother's movies always move beyond genre (whatever genre they may be screwing around with) because their characters are always a little eccentric, a little outside-the-box.  But there's nothing outside of any box in WOLVES IN THE SNOW ... except the title, which makes no sense at all.  I suspect that even if you speak French, and can forgo the subtitles, the movie will be 3-stars at best.

Bon apptit!",1306022400,3,1652,4.853571428571429
8035114,4,B0002Z8CJO,"In this indy crime thriller the mousey young wife of a small time book publisher finds herself being pursued by a scary, but definitely intriguing, sampling of Montreal's underworld.  As the walls close in she discovers a new side of herself, and her resourcefulness is one of this movie's pleasant surprises.

Lots of plot twists (perhaps too many--this is a movie you have to watch carefully). Lots of action for a french-language film.  Solid three-dimensional characters.  The famale lead was a bit wooden at times, but the French seem to like stone-faced performances from their young actresses.  Two of the hoodlums chasing our heroine had undeniable screen charm and almost stole the show.

I recommend it.",1169164800,5,713,5.103448275862069
8035115,5,B0002Z8CJO,"WOLVES IN THE SNOW begins with the news that Antoine has been cuckolding Lucie for years.  A violent marital argument ensues resulting in Antoine's death.  After lying about Antoine's whereabouts, Lucie discovers his secret life of gangsters, money laundering, and violence.  Followed, threatened and badgered by the gangsters, Lucie becomes trapped by her deceit.  The body of Antoine disappears, other corpses appear, and the money, very quickly, becomes only the pretext of an alarming turn of events.
