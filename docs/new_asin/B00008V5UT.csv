1862767,4,B00008V5UT,"I am a teacher and have found that showing this video after reading and discussing the book has been beneficial in helping my students not only accept those with learning difficulties, or special needs, but also to accept themselves for their own wonderful merits.  The symbolism is apparent to my sixth graders, leading to many eye-opening discussions in class.",1119484800,5,362,5.135593220338983
1862768,4,B00008V5UT,"This is a great story. My two kids can't get enough of it. The DVD is well done, but I do have a problem with one aspect of it. The running time says it's approximately 60 minutes long, which is VERY deceptive. The actual story is barely over 20 minutes long. They included every feature in the entire DVD into the running time, several of which are a waste. The story is excellent and the production quality is as well, but know that you're getting a story shorter than an average Veggie Tales. I'd still get it, but know what you're buying.",1085011200,25,542,4.323529411764706
1862769,1,B00008V5UT,"I thought this would be wonderful movie for my grandchildren.
Maybe it is, but this movie is hard to hear, which mean not well-crafted. The background music is too loud and prominent and the puppets' words are indistinguishable, plus it's a very short movie for the money.
My little granddaughter said, ""is that all?""  Yes, that was it.",1073606400,6,336,4.793103448275862

7987213,5,B00008V5UT,"I don't know why other reviewers had problems with sound or animation.  As someone who used to work in television, I think the production values in this DVD were wonderful: great animation, great music, great story with affirming message for both kids and adults.  In fact, this DVD was so well done, I actually felt like crying toward the end because I sympathized with the main character so much.  I wish this had been available when I was a kid -- it would have saved me the many years it took me to learn the valuable lessons contained within it.  I highly, highly recommend it.  Truly wonderful!!!",1220227200,,602,4.588785046728972

I frustration of no subtitle for CC. ...Why it said: Format: Animated, ""Closed-captioned"", Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Full Screen, Subtitled, NTSC  Need Closed-aptioned (CC) for deaf education",1211760000,,327,5.8125
7987215,5,B00008V5UT,This a great story dvd for children and adults.  I think some of the other reviewers had the same problem I did. I ordered from another seller in the new and used section and I received the DVD Read & Sing Along version which is a story book version that is a little lower production value and not animated just snapshots.  I kept mine because I think it will good for when my kids are old enough to read but I plan to reorder an animated version.,1125878400,4,447,4.126436781609195
