7032212,3,B00UART216,"Really enjoy this series BUT disappointed in lack of closed captioning ( kind of nice for hard of hearing like myself) and really disappointed that season 2 changed that very catchy, lovely theme song from season 1 to something kind of blah",1444176000,3,240,4.738095238095238
7032213,4,B00UART216,"An Hallmark favourite with many to date who remember Little House On The Prairie sitcom, this series is inspired by Janette Oke's novel about the rugged Canadian frontier and produced by non other than Michael Landon Jr.

So far each episode highlighted the life in a small frontier town which depend entirely on mining until the company proves to be guilty of endangering its employees and forced to close its doors.

Enter a lumber company, new faces and of course new developments. Our heroes remain the amiable Mountie and the young socialite turned teacher, both ready to make a difference in the community.

 An enduring series, When Calls The Heart: Heart and Soul is perfect for family viewing and offers a chance to chat about good Christian values without laying a heavy hand.

Heart and Soul episode features Elizabeth's family home and to spice it just a little, a childhood friend and suitor whom her parents believes perfect for her.

Will Elizabeth follow her parents wishes or her heart?

 Exquisite costumes and great scenery sets the over all atmosphere and one can forgive the occasional overacting in exchange for clean language and no violence.

 4 Stars!

7032219,5,B00UART216,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.
My girls and I have enjoyed the When Calls the Heart series so much! Erin Krakow and Daniel Lissing are magnificent together as Elizabeth and Jack. He's a down-to-earth Canadian Mountie. She's a upper crust society girl who came to the town of Coal Valley to teach. Watching her learn to live in this whole new world has been endearing and amusing at times. Watching the two of them grow to like each other more and more has been fun and refreshing.

In Heart and Soul Jack has gone home to Coal Valley and is busy overseeing the building of a church and school building. Elizabeth is at her family home in the city caring for her mother who has been very ill. Both Jack and Elizabeth have old sweethearts, and both face choices.
It appears that this season is going to be full of surprises.

We always enjoy these movies. In fact, as I type, my girls are watching an older episode When Calls the Heart: Change of Heart .  I like these movies because they are romantic but clean. The characters are endearing or irritating or downright despicable but never boring. ~smile~ The setting and wardrobe are completely unrealistic for a coal mining town, but it's enjoyable to watch.
This one is worth watching!",1439078400,,1249,4.566964285714286

7032221,5,B00UART216,"Another When Calls the Heart is out on DVD. This one is called Heart and Soul. If youve never watched these movies on the Hallmark channel or seen any of the former DVDs now would be an excellent time to start.  These shows are inspired by the author Janette Oke. Whom we all love.
  In Heart and Soul while Jack and Elizabeth are away from each other many things happen. Elizabeth is staying with her family until her mother gets better and Jack has to get back to Hope Valley for his Mountie duties.
  Elizabeth reacquaints herself with her old friend Charles and Jack looks out for Rosemary as she is kidnapped by so called Producers.
  Also the part I really liked is when Abigail goes to Elizabeths home to try and find her daughter-in-law.  Abigail wonders why she hasn't written or why she wouldnt stay with her. Many secrets and relationships are changing and not all in a positive way. I really love the When Calls the Heart series and Heart and Soul is fantastic.  Highly recommend this series. You will love owning these DVDs.

7032223,5,B00UART216,"Looking for a great family friendly television series, that still models the wholesome family values from shows like Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons? Then look no further than When Calls the Heart, based on the novel from Janette Oke and from producer Michael Landon Jr. for the Hallmark Channel. If you haven't watched it, trust me, go back to the very beginning and get acquainted with Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), who ventured west in the dreams of becoming a teacher despite her wealthy upbringing. She brings a love of learning to the children of Coal Valley, a mining town who recently suffered a massive mine explosion that claimed the lives of the men of the town, living the survivors to pick up the pieces.

In the DVD, Heart and Soul from the series, we find the long awaited trial into the suspected tampering of the mine by owner Henry Gowen, underway. Most of the women hope that the evidence against Mr. Gowen will be brought to light and absolve the mystery behind what caused the explosion that cost these men their lives. While Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin) works with Bill Avery (Jack Wagner), the investigator on the case to prove her husbands innocence to the town, Elizabeth Thatcher is still in Hamilton caring for her ailing mother. Even though Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), went with her, he must now return to his duties and leave Elizabeth behind, trusting that their love will survive despite the distance. Her father, however has other plans in mind when he continues to invite her childhood friend, Charles Kensington to fill in her available time in hopes she might forget all about Jack.

Back in Hope Valley, Rosemary always looking for that next big break in her budding career as an actress finds herself with a prospect of returning to San Francisco to star in an upcoming play. The two producers arrive with just the right lure for her to give up any hopes of remaining in Coal Valley, now Hope Valley. Only as usual some things are simply too goo to be true, and she finds herself being kidnapped with only our reputable hero, Jack Thornton to her rescue. When the weather turns on both of them, it forces them to take shelter in an abandoned mine overnight, which leads to ongoing rumors of what really happened among those in town. Is this the end of Elizabeth and Jack?

I received When Calls the Heart: Heart and Soul compliments of Word Films, and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. Aside from the complimentary copy of the DVD, I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. Just like in any of our favorite romances, there always has to be conflict tossed in for good measure and in this case, with distance now separating Elizabeth and Jack, we find Rosemary and Charles are the antagonists without truly intending to do so. It will be something that either strengthens their relationship or will be a wedge that will drive them apart but I'll let that one remain a mystery until you pick this one up to enjoy. This is a Dove Family Approved DVD and one I know, you will treasure as much as my family and I do. We can't wait for more in this series and well worth all 5 out of 5 stars.",1437609600,2,3228,4.610434782608696
7032224,5,B00UART216,"This is a wonderful series that is truly entertainment at its best!  The stories are heart-warming, fun, interesting, and absolutely a joy to watch.
