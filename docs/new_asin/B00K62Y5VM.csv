8656191,5,B00K62Y5VM,"Made by the BBC in 1972 this was a series of horror stories or more accurately ghost stories that had the highest production values around at the time. They are from a time when quality over quantity mattered and it really shows. Sadly only three episodes remain from the purge the BBC had of its archives back in the 70's. This is a presentation of all three from the marvellous BFI. Below I will go through all of the survivors.

`The Exorcism'. Set at a dinner party for Christmas in a lovely remote country cottage. Four friends gather to celebrate the birth of Christ - little do they know that the house holds a very dark and tragic secret and whilst they celebrate a birth of the most famous person ever to have lived, the walls and fabric of the cottage mourn the past and forgotten victims.

This is just brilliant - edge of seat stuff and a central performance from Anna Cropper so stunning that if it were to happen today - Hollywood would be offering life changing sums to get her on board - stupendous.

`Return Flight'. An air pilot who has just lost his wife has a near air collision over Germany - on reporting the incident the Germans confirm there was no plane anyway near the flight. The more he looks into it the more the past and WW II seem to have a role, but he was just that bit too young to have fought in the war - so what is really going on? This is the weakest of the three but is still completely riveting, I love the social references too like everyone seems to have to smoke - haunting.

`A Woman Sobbing'. Crikey this was dark and even thinking of it now gives me goose bumps. A married couple with two kids are living in a house where something happened years back. Every night the wife can hear a woman sobbing in the attic. The problem is no-one else can hear it; so is she mad or is it that she can only connect to this seemingly bereft spirit?

Simply a stunning conclusion and it makes you sigh with regret that the other episodes have been lost to the vagaries of past BBC's decisions. Running to around 150 minute, I watched it straight through and have to admit I was blown away. This is the classic ghost story, made credible, modern (ish) and utterly captivating. These are the stories that will keep you awake at night and the ones you will remember when the power goes out, or a floorboard creaks in the night or anything that is likely to scare the bejasus out of you - simply unmissable.",1423353600,5,2434,4.317286652078774
