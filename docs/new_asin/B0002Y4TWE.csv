2142817,3,B0002Y4TWE,"I loved the book series by Philip Jose Farmer but was somewhat disappointed with this film and it's lack of follow up by the Sci-Fi channel. But it is totally worth your time to watch it if you are a fan of the books... I recommend the first book in the series, ""To your scattered bodies go"".",1099526400,6,292,4.140350877192983
2142818,5,B0002Y4TWE,"It's about time this came out on DVD.  My taped version is getting wary of me!  This is a fantasy tale about a weird afterlife.  It begins with an astronoght some time in the future dying.  He awakens in a coccon in a river.  He comes up on a beach and meets hundreds of other people.  Few are ordinary, most are not.  All are human, but one is an alien.  A lot are from different times.  There is a man who died in a concentration camp, a Roman Emperor, an Amazon warrior, even a caveman.

These people are brought together and imprisoned.  They eventually form two factions.  One is ledt by the Roman Emperor, as he brings back the glory of Rome to this new place.  The astronught forms another group, who dodges the Roman and Joins up with Samuel Clemens on his riverboat as they head out to find out what is going on and why they are in this new world.

They better have a sequal, because it ends with the story wide open.",1098316800,2,926,4.1875

2142852,2,B0002Y4TWE,"I suppose it could have been worse. I could be like some of these poor souls who actually read the books and so were somewhat emotionally invested. Stars the perennially meh Brad Johnson and discount Laura Dern (Emily Lloyd). The only actual halfway passable acting in it was Jonathan Cake as Nero. Each of the main characters except for Brad Johnson is some famous historical figure: Alice Liddell (Alice in Wonderland); Nero; Samuel Clemens. Not sure about the African Princess woman, (producers walkin' that fine line between cultural appropriation and full blown racism in that character) or the Nazi death camp NOT survivor (can we fit any more stereotypes in here?) Of particular note, acting-wise is Brian Moore as the alien Monat: His performance is particularly awful for a main character. I want to know why all the people come back with essentially perfect bodies, but the alien gets a perpetual head spasm for no apparent reason. It seems unlikely to be an evolutionary advantage, universal among his species. Whatever. Maybe he was just trying to distract us from the really lame make-up. He's probably one guy who was glad the movie didn't get picked up as a series. Could you imagine going to work every day having to pretend to have Parkinson's disease? That's what he was in for. Pretty much all the other characters just get grunts and grrrs or whimpers and screams depending on whose side they were on. I just watched this movie. It was bad enough that I had managed to block out the fact that I had already seen it a few years ago and didn't remember that fact until about two-thirds of the way through it. The story line actually does seem decent; I might even consider checking out the book series (although I suspect I'll just take a shower and try to block out the whole sad incident from my memory again.) The director has to feel a sense of accomplishment for this made for TV movie though - it seems like he managed to squeeze in every cliche from his list of cheesy movie cliches. Don't watch this movie unless you are craving the loss of two hours of your life followed by a deep sense of regret.",1513555200,2,2125,4.639257294429708

I didn't realize this was a pilot but that's what I kept thinking the last 1/2 of the movie...that it's far too rich with characters and possibilities to possibly wrap it up so quickly.  It felt like exactly what it was, the introduction to characters who could have an endless set of adventures.  I liked it very much in that it was a thoroughly new idea.  It keeps your attention.  Hope you like fight scenes (I don't) because there are a few, yet I liked it anyway.  Made me want to start binging the series.  However, I looked on Wikipedia and learned it was MEANT to introduce a series that the SciFi Channel abandoned.  Don't know why.  Seems like a missed opportunity to me. However in 2010, a 4 part miniseries was made.  Looks like recasting which is a shame because I thought the pilot was cast very well indeed.  Looking forward to seeing that.",1512777600,2,878,4.5

2142922,2,B0002Y4TWE,"I was surprised to learn that this series had been adapted and thus my curiosity led me to check it out.

I was a fan of the books although the plot was already ridiculous by the second book.  From the opening scene, readers will be thrown, as the central character is no longer Sir Richard Burton but instead an astronaut from 2009 and we are not treated to him awakening in the resurrection banks but rather see him die in a doomed reentry. That's enough to toss this work aside but there is also a compression and modification of the timeline of events that make this work more of a loose adaptation.  Apparently, this was SyFy's first of two attempts at this material (back when they were Sci-Fi) and that channel's b-movie instincts shine through at every opportunity. Some changes are minor/practical (everyone has hair including facial hair, no hallucinogenic gum), to significant/puzzling (everyone understands each other, the grails are all free grails).

If you didn't read the books, this is just a kooky, harmless, inoffensive, slightly cheesy romp, and I say just enjoy it for what it is.
If you're a fan of the books, you'll be disappointed.",1511222400,5,1155,4.788944723618091

2142924,4,B0002Y4TWE,"Riverworld is a 2003 movie length pilot for a TV series that was never made. It is based on the world created in Philip Jos Farmer's book series of the same name. If you die you may show up in Riverworld sooner or later.

As a series pilot this would be 5 stars. Brad Johnson is well cast as Hale, a one time astronaut and the lead character. Cameron Daddo is also central as Sam the riverboat builder. On villain side Jonathan Cake plays a leader who last lived in Rome. Kevin Smith is well cast as Valdemar who is a villain and leader of vandals. There are a lot of supporting characters that also do a good job holding the story together. Things get confusing as people from all different times get reborn on Riverworld.

I originally saw the movie/pilot when it was shown on the Sci-Fi channel in 2003. Even then some of the special effects seemed a little rough - mainly around when the the riverboat is underway. But I'll give it some slack as TV pilots are not usually all that well funded...

This is a great setup for a TV series that didn't happen. Not so good as a stand-alone movie. In 2010 there was a 2 part movie/mini-series which seemed to be trying to finish up the story. Pretty much everyone was recast and outside of the premise there wasn't very much continuity with this pilot. I watched it but was not impressed. A few of the actors had been regulars on the Battlestar Galactica reboot and one was a repeat character from Stargate SG1. I think that follow-on mini-series is a poor try for closure in terms of quality and continuity with this movie/pilot.

So, I'll take this Riverworld video for what it is: a pilot of what could have been a very interesting TV series that was never picked up. No demerits for having no closure/ending to the story. That wasn't the intention. This pilot is to introduce the viewer to the characters and plot arc of Riverworld and leave us wanting more from that unrealized series. I think Riverworld has done that very well. I'm giving it 4 stars because the ending is unsatisfying as a standalone movie.. For *not* picking up the series I'd giveSyfy channel zero stars.

2142998,4,B0002Y4TWE,This looked like it was setup to either be a series of movies or perhaps the pilot for a show. I thought it was decent.,1508889600,,119,3.8
2142999,3,B0002Y4TWE,"So the movie sets a really interesting theme and world, with a mysterious ""locals"" that occasionally interact to aid the protagonist.  This aspect of the movie takes a back seat to a silly story about the people ""birthed"" into the world forming two small competing civilizations.  Its more or less a struggle move between the new arrivals who all stick together dealing with a ruthless leader and his army, who happen to almost all be ex roman soldiers, and by luck of the new arrivals is a roman leader who quickly takes control.  Other group is a mark twain riverboat group trying to build a boat that the other group wants.

Its not bad, just disappointing they focused the movie on the least interesting aspects.  The shoe horned ""famous people"" wasn't done very well, seems you could have died at any time in history but they all went into the riverwold at the same time, so you have the protagonist whos an astronaut with romans and even a silly neanderthal ape man (whos only seen at the beginning)

Acting is ok, fight scenes are pretty bad....the ending touches slightly on the real interesting storyline setting up for a sequel that never happened.

Even the one random non human life form whos there, and with an actual good reason, isn't done poorly, and is interesting and adds somewhat to the story....yet the entire focus is on roman emperor and his newly acquired army of ""bad people"" vs the noble and fair river boat folk.  Everything interesting with the world is sort of in the background to this struggle...which ends predictably and without any closure as to why they are really there (hinted at by the alien guy) or who the hooded locals are...or the story behind the planet or dimension they are in (could be either but isn't explained)

Wish they had the battle of peoples story as the side dish not the main focus and explained the interesting stuff and had them reach the destination they were headed to vs ending with them sailing down the river, which isn't a spoiler because the protagonist has visions of it within a few minuets and explains its going to happen ect.

After watching it last night im still thinking about the interesting setting and story theme that wasn't touched the entire movie....so its worth a watch imo.  Just understand its not going anywhere interesting and leaves you hanging.",1508803200,,2332,4.719211822660099

2143002,4,B0002Y4TWE,"This was not a movie, it was a Pilot for a TV show based on Philip Jose Farmer's Riverworld book series. I'm sure the explanation would have been spread along the entire series, so the Pilot was necessarily vague. As a free standing movie for people who never read the books, this movie might make no sense.
I LOVED the books, they were a huge part of my childhood, so this movie's very existence was a delight to me. As such, there were some big flaws, it did not follow the exact book storyline, nor was it a great script or even good acting. However, it's RIVERWORLD, and just to see something RIVERWORLD on film made me happy to watch it.
To fill in some background from the books... everyone who ever lived on earth found themselves resurrected on the shores of this big river. As shown in the film, every human who died resurrected randomly, every era, every epoch, every nation were haphazardly scattered onto the shores. So you die, you wake up, and you are on the banks of this river, and every human who ever lived is somewhere on this world, including your family, friends, enemies, ancestors, descendants. This is explained in the movie, but easy to miss it.
Also not explained, this world is vast, many many times larger than our earth, with 1 giant river that runs across all of it. So imagine the possibilities, the stories, the suffering and the joys. Not made clear in this movie is that you can't die again permanently. You die, and then you get resurrected on a different part of the river. So you could theoretically kill yourself (or get yourself killed) over and over to travel the world. In the book series, they actually do eventually figure out what aliens did this and how they did it. It's an imaginary feast, epic, amazing, and incredible food for thought.
This movie should have been a teensy fraction of the whole, a single section of a single thread, in a tapestry of life's 2nd chances. A long-running fascinating series with years, decades, of episodes.  If you didn't read the books, you probably won't like this movie. If you did read the books, you will probably watch this and say... MORE!!! I WANT MORE!! So frustrating that this was never made into a full blown series:(.",1508716800,3,2210,4.58080808080808

The acting is about what you expect for a pilot, a little better than poor. Usually the newbie actors get better as a series progresses. The story line was interesting and I wish someone would pick it up to continue it. I would definitely watch the series. Considering how long it's been, it's not likely.

There is extreme heat of the shuttle cockpit on re-entry, but the paper photo of his family never even curls at the edges? The heat kills him, but paper is just fine? An Air Force officer beats a seasoned, well-trained Roman, and becomes leader? Seriously? This is the same branch that cancels PT because it's raining, while the combat abilities of a Roman is legendary. An African slave girl who was captured ""by white people"" and died in the cargo hold of a slave ship? She may have been PURCHASED by ""white people"" (although, back then, they would have been very specific about their nationality, as well as the flag flying on the ship; there were no ""white people"" back then), but certainly not CAPTURED by them. Blacks of one African tribe were captured and sold by a different African tribe. She would have been captured by people of her own skin color, and would not have been shocked that the white guy was captured into slavery by other white people. She also would not have viewed the people of different African tribes as her people, simply because of their mutual skin color, like the agenda-indoctrinated of today. The same goes for ""whites"". No Englishman would have considered an Irishman to be ""his people"", regardless of skin color. This film supposedly includes people from different times in history, but they all act like modern stereotypes. Mark Twain gave up his boat, so he could pilot her? Seriously? Riverboat captains piloted their own boats all the time. There was no reason for him to give up his title of captain to, you guessed it, the Air Force officer who was constantly portrayed as a warrior.

Then a remake came out and it was a little better but still had the same problems.

2143129,3,B0002Y4TWE,"Usually people say the book is better than the film. This is one of those exceptions.

Riverworld is a world which has one long river cutting across the planet that everyone goes to when they die. They all wake up around the same age speaking the same language and there are these alien structures which dispense food. People who woke up earlier have established primitive kingdoms.

The original Riverworld series was a 5-book series which while an interesting concept was heavily-padded and ultimately went nowhere with some boring bland characters including the author!

This unsuccessful pilot did a much better job at re-creating that world with a different set of characters. In the original Richard Burton (the explorer not the actor) is the main character and the main enemy in four of the books is King John who was just a miserable sod.

In this version the protagonist is an astronaut of the earlier 21st century and the main villain is Nero. With the astronaut we are able to get a hero with some understanding of technology and the concept of aliens unlike the 19th century Burton. With Nero we have a complex twisted villain who sees himself as a hero and having been an emperor he would have commanded the loyalty of thousands to hundreds of thousands in his time unlike a medieval king who fought his own barons much of the time. Nero could call upon many of the inhabitants in this new world so he makes a more believable threat.

It's a shame that the series was never followed through with because I would have liked to have seen what they would have done with their version of Riverworld.

It was actually this movie which got me interested in the novels but the novels I soon found to be terrible with characters that are picked up and dropped and an ending that was so anti-climatic which really never answered anything.

2143147,4,B0002Y4TWE,"Based very loosely on Philip Jose Farmer's book(s), this was intended as the pilot for a TV series, and so has an unfinished aspect. Much of what was a part of the book Riverworld is barely suggested here, but if you can view it as an adventure, without thinking about the books, or if you've never read the books, you will probably enjoy this quite a lot.

Riverworld is not heaven or hell, but it is populated by people who have died on earth. There is exactly one alien, because he happened to be visiting the earth when he died. And there is exactly one child, but nobody seems to know why. Everyone else is a physically healthy adult. People who died of old age are young again, including Sam Clemens and Alice Liddle.

Food and clothing are provided anonymously through a series of mushroom-shaped structures and canisters. The canisters were on the beach as they came ashore, and contained clothing. The next morning, the mushroom towers had holes in the sides where a canister inserted came out with food in it. Although the people who came ashore as a batch with our hero (an astronaut from 2009) were from very different eras and countries, they all seem to speak English. That is, whatever they believe they are speaking is understood by all the others, and it's English as far as the audience is concerned.

But it doesn't take long to discover that there are a great many more people who have been there longer, and have built their own little societies. And almost inevitably, they come into conflict. Why? The mushrooms provide sustenance, so what's the point of fighting? The best explanation is illustrated by the king of the Vandals and by Nero. There is something about having power and control over others that seems to be necessary to their sense of manhood.

Then there's women to fight over, and also women to do some pretty fierce fighting themselves. There's a pagan priestess who fights better than most of the men, in fact.

There's also Sam Clemens and his riverboat, built with the help of the single alien who powers it with something otherworldly. And a few good hammer blows from Alice when the mechanism fails to start up.

As I say, it was designed to be a pilot for a series. Sort of a pity the series was never made. I think it would have gone well.",1336867200,,2285,4.574572127139365

I liked everything but the actors/characters (which makes things awkward).  I found most of them to be off-putting: Brad Johnson came across as tired (as though he was sick to death of playing these types of roles), Emily Lloyd was clearly out of her depth, Jonathan Cake's entire performance was based on his ability to smirk well, while Cameron Daddo's accent was intermittent throughout.....

2143152,3,B0002Y4TWE,"There is a tendency for Hollywood to take a series of related novels and squeeze them together to fit one ninety minute film.  The result is most often a jumble that proves a disappointment to the readers who come to the movie with high expectations.  In RIVERWORLD, author Phillip Jose Farmer postulates a colossal world populated exclusively by those who have died on earth from any era only to be reincarnated somewhere on Riverworld.  The premise is both astounding and metaphysical.  Farmer's novels explore the reality and the morality of life reborn in a land that promises to be neither heaven nor hell.  However, director Kari Skolgard gives us a film and fills it with a standard hero villain format to such an extant that Skolgard might just as easily placed his cast in a Lost Continent environment.  There are only scattered attempts to infuse a pallid script with the real trauma of beings facing rebirth in a land that looks suspiciously like the banks of the Mississippi River.

Brad Johnson is Hale, an American astronaut who dies while on a space mission.  The film opens with him in a sort of underwater bubble from which he bursts out to swim to shore.  There he meets Alice Hargreaves (Emily LLoyd) who in her ""real"" life was a favorite of explorer Richard Burton.  Other interesting characters appear: a Jewish survivor from Birkenau, a beautiful slave girl, and the historical Nero.  The plot quickly devolves into a standard Mad Max actioner in which the villain (Nero) attempts to recreate on Riverworld a semblance of the empire he ruled on earth.  Along the way, he attempts to seduce the reticent Alice although one would think that he would be more attracted to the Warrior-Princess like slave girl who spends more than a few minutes dancing a slave girl bugaloo to the delight of all.  It is almost a quibble to point out that it would have been impossible for the reincarnated humans to have constructed even a semblance of a post-industrial level of technology that results in a steam driven paddle boat.  It is simply a matter of not having the tools to build the tools to build the tools.  Further, the film hints at a hooded race of beings who appear at convenient moments to suggest that Riverworld has a plan that may be carried out in further sequels.  It would have taken more spirit and vision for director Skolgard to have abandoned the action format and instead consider the spiritual and psychological ramifications of a transition from death on Earth to rebirth on Riverworld.

Hopefully someday someone may retry to make a series based on the books. In the meantime I suggest you check this movie out. A modern astronaut finds himself on a beach of a strange world. The people he meets are fairly similar to what he has known on Earth but the era seems like a conglomeration of eras from Earth's past and the planet economy is centered on river travel. In order to get around he takes passage on a steam paddlewheeler. My only complaint is this was obviosuly a pilot for a series that never happened.

2143179,3,B0002Y4TWE,"I will say this - the film did inspire me to read the original five books which, despite their tendancy to lengthy pontifications, are still fun to read and full of surprises, as well as some unavoidable cliches.

As a sci-fi channel mini-series, it would have worked well if the studio had chosen to follow the novels and the original story, They did not. It used elements from the first two books, but the only characters who remained intact from the original were Alice, Sam, Lev, Gwenafra, and the alien Monat, though he is more or less combined with Joe Miller, the lovable hulk who follows Sam loyally through most of the series.

However, being a 90-minute TV production, it seems to have been clearly intended as a series pilot.  For a continuous series of adventures, the cast of new characters would have been the most workable.  They would not have been tied to the existing story line in quite the same way, and after all, in the Riverworld, everyone (and I do mean everyone) is there, so any characters can exist.

This film seemed to try having it both ways: new characters as well as old, a different story set within the same premise.  Sam Clemens was a lot more likable than his book counterpart, as was the alien, Monat.  But there were a number of things that I personlly found very bothersome.  First of all, instead of all of the human race being resurrected simultaneously, the citizens of Riverworld seem to be arriving in waves every few years.  There were also horses, which did not exist in the Riverworld at all.  The grail canisters were a disappointment because in the books they provided not only clothing, but fine, full meals instead of the icky green-and-yellow strips of what looked like epoxy ribbons!  But the most annoying part of all was the arrival of the Emperor Nero.  He was a substitute for other characters in the books, probably because he was better known to most of the audience.  But even so, this Nero had nothing whatsoever to do with the real Nero of history, and one of the more interesting things about farmer's books was his knowledge of the historical characters he portrayed.

The film is a mixed bag.  It is enjoyable and fun on one level, but unsatisfactory on another.  Best advice is to enjoy the film first, then read the books.",1206835200,2,2289,4.628712871287129
2143180,5,B0002Y4TWE,"I read this book originally many years ago, I think it was written in the early seventies but its aged well. Many of us believe in the afterlife but rarely ever give much thought to the practicalities of what this afterlife could be like if,when, and where we are resurrected.

Basically it's a yarn about a diverse group of people and an alien who try to find the source of the river by building a riverboat and in doing so find out why they were resurrected in the first place. They have many adventures and managed to meet many interesting people from various epochs on the way. It can be quite violent in places but when people are killed they find themselves reborn on another section of the riverbank and usually within a different entnic group.

2143182,3,B0002Y4TWE,"Since I've not read the books, someone will have to help me with how faithful this is to the books, but in the movie an astronaut dies in a space shuttle crash, and wakes up on a strange new world. Everyone who ever lived is reborn on this new world with all the memories of their previous life, but with a 25 year old body. They are given clothing and food from mysterious canisters.

Nero, the infamous evil emperor of Rome, leads the bad guys as they attempt to take control. Mark Twain leads a group of rebels who construct a River Boat, and want to sail up the river to find out what is the source of this strange river and what is the meaning of this planet.

A little internet research shows that this ""movie"" was actually supposed to be a television pilot for a Science Fiction channel TV series based on Riverworld which for one reason or another never got green lighted. That explains the low production values, and the fact that most of the questions (like, what is this strange planet and why is everyone there) remain unanswered at the end of the film.

Despite the low production values, and a lot of technical goofs in this film (day suddenly turning to night, etc), I've got to say that I thought it was a lot more interesting than many of the big budget Hollywood block busters I've seen in my time. Despite the ridiculous plot, it is kind of fun to imagine what would happen if all of history's people all of a sudden woke up on the same river at the same time. Maybe its shame this never got made into its own series, but I'll have to pick up the books someday.

For the amateur history buff, there is plenty to nit-pick. Aside from the fact that they were both evil, the Nero in this film could not be more different from his historical inspiration. The Nero in this film is super-macho, fearless, an excellent fighter, is admired by his men, and has dreams of conquest and empire. The historical Nero was a fat mamma's boy who had to rig athletic contests so he could win, who abandoned the running of the empire so he could focus on the arts, and who was a weakling who barely had the strength to perform his own suicide. To the film's credits, it does address some of these incongruities near the end when one of the characters confronts Nero about the historical record, but I thought it was too little too late.

Other minor stuff as well. At one point a former holocaust victim tries to tell an African slave ship victim that he too was enslaved by white men. She has trouble believing that white people would be so wicked as to enslave their own race, but Africans themselves enslaved other Africans during era of slavery. Also the image of Mark Twain in this movie certainly isn't the image I get of him from reading his books, but I guess some of this is open to interpretation.

Also, given that everyone wakes up on this strange planet naked as the day they were born, I have a hard time believing that they could construct all the weapons and buildings they have. The explanation given is that some people have been on River World for as long as 10 years, but I doubt even 10 years would be long enough to mine all the metal and construct all the swords and armor that Nero and the bad guys use, much less the elaborate post-industrial revolution steamboat that Mark Twain and his friends build.

2143197,3,B0002Y4TWE,"I have greatly enjoyed the Riverworld books and knew there was no way to fit the series into a single film.  I just didn't know how little of the series would make it.  Richard Francis Burton is missing as main character (replaced by an astronaut).  He finds himself awake under water and eventually surfaces and makes it to a shore.  He is shortly followed by dozens of others.  It is quickly realized that everyone is not from the same time and many are younger than they remember.  People have been resurrected in a strange place.

The plot of this movie revolves around said astronaut and a local warlord who has been in operation for some ten years (unlike the books everyone is not resurrected at once but has been done in groups).  The warlords organization is quickly made out to be the threat and rebels are found.  the rebels are building a fabulous riverboat.  The rest of the film mostly involves character development and almost nothing of the possibilities of the books and little of the world.

Grailstones have been replaced by obelisks.  The river only occasionally look like a river (there is usually no far shore).  Although older residents use the term Riverworld, no explanation is ever mentioned so viewers will be in the dark if they are not familiar with the books.

2143198,4,B0002Y4TWE,"It's been quite a while since I've read Philip Jose Farmer's RiverWorld books, but I didn't think this movie was quite up to snuff. The premise is the same, the dead from all periods of history find themselves resurrected in RiverWorld. Gang fighting, Lord-of-the-Flies-type stuff ensues. My main attraction to the books was the protagonist, the dashing explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton. (Found the source of the Nile, first westerner into Muslim kingdoms, translated the Arabian Nights and the Kama Sutra, etc. He was the real-life version of the Victorian hero all those romance novelists try to recreate.) This movie has Brad Johnson playing an astronaut as the main character. Mark Twain is kept as a character, building Mississippi paddle wheelers to navigate the mighty river, but sadly John Lackland (Former King of England, Richard the LionHeart's brother - you know, the evil King John from the Robin Hood tales) has been changed to Nero, probably because the average TV viewer would say ""John who?"". Still, not a bad watch, could make an interesting series - the abrupt ending is obviously a set-up for a potential series.

If the concept interests you, I recommend reading the books instead. TO YOUR SCATTERED BODIES GO, THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT, THE DARK DESIGN, THE MAGIC LABYRINTH, and THE GODS OF RIVERWORLD, all by Philip Jose Farmer.

2143199,3,B0002Y4TWE,"I read parts of the Riverworld book series many years ago, but never bothered to read the rest - it just didn't hold my interest all that much. The movie is somewhat the same. I watched it all the way through and I might (or might not) watch a sequel, but it's not the most stirring stuff.

The premise is interesting enough: all of humanity, all the way back to the dawn of human evolution, has been reincarnated by agencies unknown. The returnees are scattered the shores of a seemingly infinite river, with nowhere to go except up and down that river. People from every place and time are mixed together - Nero meets Mark Twain, that kind of thing. As in the original book, the combinations made little narrative sense and never engaged my imagination.

Despite the historical majority of people from the many parts of Asia and Africa, they are oddly rare (in this part of the river, at least), and everyone speaks English. After all these failures to use potentially exciting material, what's left is an ordinary adventure. There are good guys and and bad guys, pretty women and cute kids, sword fights and Mysterious Objects, all paraded out in conventional ways.

Parts of the timing and sequel-bait ending suggest that this was originally a TV mini-series. I imagine it worked pretty well in that context, and the Riverworld books would have given lots of material to carry on with. There have been lots of worse series, and lots of worse movies built from series pieces bolted together. There have been better, too.

All in all we have a good story-line and some very competent international actors and actresses.

Our main protagonist and hero is a man called Jeff Hale (a sexy American in the guise of Brad Johnson), once an astronaut who died in a crash and is reborn out of a bubble that is pierced with a spear along with other people who have lived throughout most of human history and who have somehow ended up on a mysterious planet called 'Riverworld'.

It seems that anyone who has ever lived and died on Earth comes to Riverworld rather than an afterlife and this does not exclude other world beings either.  An extra-terrestrial call Monat (Brian Moore) has the unfortunate luck of dying on earth in 2039 when his space craft crashed and he too is ""reborn"" to Riverworld and all its mysteries and secrets.

The humans which include Emily Lloyd as Alice Liddell Hardgreaves, an African Priestess call Mali, (Karen Holness) and one Alien are pretty much left to their own devices and as you can imagine they end up becoming quite tribal in their outlook, especially as the Emperor Nero (the English actor Jonathan Cake looking pretty hot despite being a baddie!) has been reborn and he's looking to rule the ""new born ones"" in the only way he knows how, through the blade and sheer brutality,

A few of the ""new born ones"" get together and with Hale lead a revolt against Nero and in a river-boat designed by the mysterious Sam (Australian actor Cameron Daddo) set off to explore this mysterious new world made up of connecting rivers that lead to.....?

There is also a race of black hooded 'beings' who seem to have some sort of cosmic plan for the rebels in the riverboat but we aren't privy to what it is and this is a little irritating as there is no sequel to explain it all but that is what happens when a pilot movies flops.

At the end of the film, our new friends are just embarking on an adventure of discovery (and possibly more) that looks as if it would overshadow anything that's already happened in the first 2 hours of the film.  We're left with an unexplained race of shadowy figures plotting or planning things we know nothing about.

So if you choose to buy this, hopefully you'll do so fully aware that you're buying something that feels like a multi-part series, of which you will only EVER get to see Part I, with absolutely NO conclusion of the main story issues, mysteries, etc. (Sub-plots are resolved, but the greater thread of the story is left glaringly unfinished).

This was obviously intended as a back-door pilot, but unfortunately the Sci-fi Channel never followed through.  I find this sad because, while the characters were cliche, the actors were all more than competent to portray them, and could have easily handled the more complicated roles.

It seems the Sci-fi Channel is determined to continue pumping all the money set aside for original series into Space Opera, with a few annoying reality shows.

8034641,5,B0002Y4TWE,Pleasantly surprised. Original plot and quite interesting.,1517529600,,58,7.428571428571429
8034642,4,B0002Y4TWE,"Maybe not exactly four stars, but it is strangely entertaining.  The bad guy good guy type film.  Like old Westerns or even the corny star wars type.

Acting is not horrible, considering the plot and the rather corny nature of the script.  And it has a nice combination of action and curiosity (about what  is to come) to make you watch it to the end.

Left me wondering though.  If these people are dead, why are they all so afraid of dying?",1516233600,,442,4.317073170731708

8034644,2,B0002Y4TWE,"Most of the acting was not as awful as could have been but the editing was HORRIBLE! It is so cropped up it is hard to follow. Seems like this is the summary cut of a longer movie. Of course, it is nothing compared to the books.",1515715200,,228,3.872340425531915

8034646,4,B0002Y4TWE,"This is really more of a 3.5, but I rounded up to 4 stars. You have to take it for what it seems to be--a made for TV movie that was made to try and get a TV show started (If that isn't what this was, I'll eat my hat). So don't expect big budget anything, or stellar anything, and you'll be fine. Also, I DID NOT read the books, so I didn't come in with that bias. It was an interesting start of a story, you obviously aren't going to get a full resolution, so don't expect one. You do meet some interesting characters and get some measure of entertainment for a little while. I'm not sorry I watched it, but I wouldn't be broken hearted if I'd missed it, either. Use your own judgement!
If you like sci-fi and fantasy stuff, and don't mind the low quality stuff sometimes just for the imagination stretch, then you might not feel like this was a waste of time after.",1514332800,,867,4.136094674556213
