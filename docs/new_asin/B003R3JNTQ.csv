4176380,4,B003R3JNTQ,"I am not going to review the films themselves rather how they look and sound on blu-ray.
  BLOODSPORT:being the older and cheaper of the two films you would expect it to have the worst video and audio and it has. The picture is fine though compared to dvd,could it be better,yes,but for the price i paid i don't think so. The audio in my opinion is worse than the video(i know its only DTS-HD 2.0)but i still had to adjust my system(which isn't the greatest i will admit)a lot to get the best sound possible.
  TIMECOP:the audio(5.1 DTS-HD) and video are good,easily way better than the dvd. The picture is really good thru out and it holds up well even with the more modern CGI effects. The opening scene in particular is excellent.
  I don't own either film on dvd but i have seen them a couple of times on dvd.
So for 12/13 dollars they are worth getting especially if you are a JVC fan.",1298160000,11,890,4.331325301204819
4176381,5,B003R3JNTQ,"You're either a Van Damne fan or you're not...there's no in-between.  If you are you're interested in the blu-ray transfer.  Very good.  Sound is definitely improved.  Picture is excellent on both (I didn't notice discernable difference between the two films).
Proper aspect ratio on both.  I recommend for fans...and if you're not a fan...these might make you one.",1297036800,4,365,5.224137931034483
4176382,4,B003R3JNTQ,"Interesting that they make this Van Damme Action Double Feature spread its focus to two different genres of movies. One being martial arts and one being science fiction. As others have mentioned it would have made more sense to do the same genres like TimeCop/Cyborg or Bloodsport/Lionheart (which gets my vote in spite of the just as viable Bloodsport/Kickboxer option). Unlike most combo packs that give you two movies on two disks this one is two movies on a single sided disk.

Bloodsport is arguably Jean Claude Van Damme's greatest martial arts film. Is it because of the amazing action? Not really? Deep and involved story? No. None of that here. Fantastic acting? Now you're making me giggle. Bloodsport hit a moment in time when martial arts movies were on the upswing and put out a kind of film that transcends your conventional concepts of what to find in a fighting film. In a very real way this helps negate the lack of a real plot or compelling character acting.

So what makes Bloodsport the exception to the rule? In a word: tournament. This is movie at its heart is all about a martial arts tournament. Sure there is a notoriously evil villain and a manhunt by the military. Sure there is a love interest and tragedy among friends, but all of that is really either just window dressing or distraction from the real reason the movie rocks. What you get in Bloodsport is the showcasing of martial arts from all over the world. Different styles going toe to toe against each other in a winner takes all full contact competition. Not since Bruce Lee's Game of Death has a movie taken the time to show varying forms of fighting.

You get to see martial arts styles in action like Kung Fu, kickboxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, Karate, Judo, Tae Kwon Do, street brawl and some I have never seen before. You get to see them all in the ring. Some all too briefly, but considering the sheer amount of various forms you can forgive that. You of course also get to see Van Damme doing his signature helicopter kicks, full splits and other moves I haven't seen him do on any other movie. This is also the movie that inspired Johnny Cage's signature non-fatality move in the original Mortal Kombat video game.

The acting is B-movie. Van Damme sometimes gives a good performance and other times overacts. Other actors offer varying performances. Donald Gibb, who plays Van Damme's street tough buddy, seems to enjoy his role and plays it with a slight wink and nod. Norman Burton and Forest Whittaker as the military police make a good ensemble performance. But lets face it. Most of these guys are not actors. They are fight choreographers, martial artists and stunt men. Besides you aren't here to see Shakespeare. You're here to see Bolo Yeung tussle in the ring (and did you know he was like 49 when he did this film?!? I wished I looked half that healthy years younger).

Now this is a Blu-Ray release so how does it look? Well... it's better than any previous release. You get a level of clarity that I don't even remember when I saw it in theaters. That being said it's still a VERY grain-ridden film. If you did screen caps of the movie it wouldn't even look like good standard definition close up. I don't know if this is because the movie was done on a small budget, thus wasn't using the best film (maybe it was shot in 16mm instead of 35mm?) or because nobody bothered to get the original negatives and do an honest restoration. Either way this movie will never hold up to other Blu-Rays. Heck it may not even hold up to newer movies in standard definition upscaled.

Audio is clear and in stereo, but that's about it. Nothing to scream about here. Then again this movie's montage-laden power songs sounded a little dated even back when it was first released in 1988. I swear those songs were stuck in 1985. So yea the soundtrack is a product of the time, but in a low budget movie sort of way it works.

I hear the movie's budget was just over a million dollars, and according to Box Office Mojo it made almost $12 million in the box office. Doesn't sound like much, but it's a ten fold return on investment.

Timecop I haven't seen yet on this disk and the last time I did see it was back in the theaters. I don't remember it all too well, but I do recall it was a cool enough concept. Imagine criminals that go to the past with modern weapons to steal. That's the general idea of the movie. I recall it was one of Van Damme's best acting performances to date. Special effect go from pretty good to over the top on the CG end. I will put more once I actually watch the thing.

From what I see there are absolutely no extra features on either disk. You get the films in English and French audio with the same in subtitles (plus Spanish subtitles). That's it. Bottom line if you want the best looking Bloodsport or Timecop video this is it, but don't expect anything else.",1294704000,18,4898,4.49438202247191
4176383,3,B003R3JNTQ,"I think ""Timecop"" would have been better to be back to back with maybe ""Cyborg.""

Anyway, I think ""Bloodsport"" looks fabulous with the streets of Bangkok in the backdrop of the film.  Some of the acting is atrocious in ""Bloodsport"", especially the terrible kid actor that played the younger Frank Dux.  And Donald Gibb (playing Jackson) was rather over-exaggerated as a know-it-all making American's look stupid.  But still, I can't help but still think that ""Bloodsport"" is one of Jean Claude's best films.

""Timecop"" was a little hard to appreciate.  I guess I might have to watch it again but sometimes movies about time travel can be easy to get lost in.  It may take a second viewing to catch everything that I might have missed the first time, that I may not have understood.  Unfortunately, ""Timecop"" wasn't interesting enough for me to watch it again any time soon, but, I do now have both ""Kickboxer"" and ""Bloodsport"" on Blu-Ray disc.  The only other three Van Damme films that I want on Blu-Ray are ""Nowhere To Run,"" ""Death Warrant,"" and then maybe ""Lionheart.""  ""Hard Target"" might be okay to put back to back with any of these other three I mentioned.

""Bloodsport"" I would give 4 and a half stars, but ""Timecop"" only gets about 2 and a half from me.",1288483200,6,1262,4.665158371040724

4176385,5,B003R3JNTQ,"I was VERY happy this finally came out on Blu-ray.  It was worth the wait.  I have always been a big fan of sci-fi and time travel movies.  (""Time After Time"" anyone?)

4176386,5,B003R3JNTQ,"I discovered Jean-Claude Van Damme just recently. In fact I watched my first Van Damme film this summer (Universal Soldier), and I was blown away. Thus, I have begun to buy as many Van Damme films I can find. Though he is not really an excellent actor, he is good at making the audience root for him. No matter how ridiculous his acting gets at time, you can't help but be on his side. At this point, I have watched Universal Solider, Universal Solider: Regeneration, JCVD, Kickboxer, and Replicant. When I found out that Bloodsport and Timecop would be put in the same Blu-ray  for the very affordable price of 20 bucks, I pounced. I was not dissapointed. Bloodsport is Van Dammes' breakthrough film. It is the story of Frank Dux participating in the Kumite, while this story has by all means been debunked and Dux has been ousted as a fraud and a liar, this movie continues to be one of Van Damme's best performances. Timecop is the real gem here though. Out of all the Van Damme films I've seen, Timecop is one of the most enjoyable. I absolutely loved the movie and the sillines of it all. You should be warned that this a bare-bones release of both films and the quality of the movies is quite impressive. If you are a Van Damme fan, buy this set. It is completely worth the money.",1286409600,19,1286,4.4261603375527425

4176455,4,B003R3JNTQ,"I'll get right to it, in my opinion these are Van Damme's BEST two movies!  I have been a huge fan of Timecop since I saw it during its theatrical run (yes, I am old).  Bloodsport (which I also saw during the theatrical run...yep...old) was enjoyable but nothing I returned to visit in over twenty years.

As one of the co-hosts for the podcast Don & his Amazing Friend, our show monthly digs into the archives of the 1980s for films beyond the mainstream.  In January our movie of choice was Bloodsport and I loved it!  It definitely is one of the few movies to escape from Cannon films and still hold up so many decades later...even if some of the tales of Frank Dux does not.

Fans of 1980s cinema and martial arts who have never seen Bloodsport should give it a try.  There's a decent plot, some fun fighting, and a style of guerilla movie making that rarely exists today.  The filmmakers got quite a bit of mileage on a limited budget.  Plus, there's awesome 80s music from Stan Bush (of ""You've Got the Touch"" fame).  While never at risk of earning any form of Academy Award, you'll spend 90 minutes thoroughly entertained.

Timecop (which we have not reviewed as yet) also holds up well.  The movie has a unique approach to time travel and a stellar performance from villain Ron Silver.  I especially love the final third of the movie where we get two Van Damme's for the price of one!

The price for these two movies is a steal.  Really the only downside is that there are no special features for either movie.  I would love to listen to a Bloodsport audio commentary reuniting the cast to reflect on their experiences and how it changed their careers...heck one of the supporting cast is Forrest Whitaker for god's sake!

4176486,5,B003R3JNTQ,Bloodsport/Timecop was shipped on time for christmas with another product. Very good blu-ray combo pack for any Jean Claude Van Damme fans. Both movies come together on one blu-ray disc. Don't expect high quality 1080p from movies made in the 80's/90's but the quality is still pretty good.,1357603200,,290,5.0625
4176487,4,B003R3JNTQ,"It's Jean Claud Van Damn, what's not to like about it? I love blu rays and always look for older double or triple features so when I came across this jewel, I couldn't resist.",1357171200,,175,4.176470588235294
4176488,5,B003R3JNTQ,"A great Van Damme double feature, Bloodsport Van Damme's first big movie and Time Cop based on a comic book. Bloodsport is a great fight movie with all kinds of fighting styles.

4176491,5,B003R3JNTQ,You either like him or you don't. Bloodsport is a nostalgia inducing movie for kids that grew up on 80's american martial arts movies.,1354060800,,134,4.625

I have not put it in my player, so I have nothing to say about it, but I'm happy with my purchase because of Bloodsport.  While some scenes have not withstood the test of time so well, the fighting remains pretty awesome to watch.",1350172800,,398,4.28

Now thats a deal! Not to mention that it comes with TIMECOP, a better movie than the CGI crap that they are making now!!  Already saw both movies on my PS3 and the picture quality is perfect, alot clearer than a regular DVD format, and the sound is great.  It had been 13 years since I had saw BLOODSPORT and the fight scenes still are great!",1347062400,3,505,3.9702970297029703
4176496,5,B003R3JNTQ,I LOVE JCVD (JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME) AND JUST HAD TO OWN THESE TWO .IF YOU LIKE HIS MOVIES THEN THESE 2 ARE WORTH PICKING UP PLUS THEY'RE ON BLU-RAY(SMILEY FACE),1344124800,,160,4.193548387096774
4176497,5,B003R3JNTQ,"i grew up with Van damme and all the hype he came with, it was a great time in the martial arts, schools were filled because of him. The bluray is ok but nothing compares to the big screen and the people in the theater going crazy, Bloodsport was the greatest martial arts movie of all time and you needed to experience it back in the 80's when it was unfolding before everyone's eyes, At the time it was all ninja crap, nothing was around in film like Bloodsport, because of Bloodsport the video stores were overloaded with B karate movies trying to copy it, but never could come close..The fact that Time cop is with it sux, that movie was lame. Bloodsport needs to stand alone..the reason both are together is simple no one would buy time cop by it self",1331683200,,756,4.330985915492958
4176498,5,B003R3JNTQ,I like old school! And for me this is it! Since somehow i lost several of my dvds i tried it blue ray i am not to impress but no regrets i like this movie! One of my favorites with me again!,1326240000,,190,3.5476190476190474
4176499,5,B003R3JNTQ,"Clearly Bloodsport is his best movie for what he does.  He's a terrible actor and a moderately skilled martial artist, but what he does he does best. You end up hating the bad guys, and can't help but get excited as he rally's (at the end of every movie).  Timecop is a throw away in my opinion-it was his highest grossing movie but Van Damme needed to stick with ""fight"" movies.  Check out the rankings on IMDB and you'll see the same thing.  Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Lionheart.  The rest tried to go mainstream and any one of us could act better than him.  Great to see this on blue-ray, a profound difference from the VHS.  Even my wife enjoyed the movie (it helps he was Mr. Belgium I'm sure)....",1323302400,2,698,4.40625
4176500,5,B003R3JNTQ,"Being a big fan of ""Time Travel Movies"", ""Time Cop"" has to be in the top ten of all the time travel movies. If you haven't seen this one, you're really missing out on one of the best.

4176501,5,B003R3JNTQ,I have the DVD version of this as well and if you like these movies you will like them more in Hi Def. I noticed a big improvement in quality which is not always the case when switching to Blu Ray. It is more noticeable on Timecop though.,1305158400,2,238,3.9791666666666665
4176502,4,B003R3JNTQ,"Okay, I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme.  He's NOT a good actor by any stretch of the imagination.  But he is good at the action/martial arts and honestly, I believe these two movies are the best he's done.

Buying them together on blu-ray was a no-brainer and well worth the money I spent - $9.99.",1304467200,,324,4.193548387096774
4176503,5,B003R3JNTQ,I think the Bluray looks good. Anyone who thinks too much into this stuff needs a life. Van Damme is bad ass as usual and never gets enough credit.,1300147200,3,147,4.103448275862069
4176504,5,B003R3JNTQ,"These movies are a quandary, for sure, and Im not even talking about the fuzzy logic of Timecop's time-travel. Let's be honest, they aren't great movies in a traditional way.  Still, there is something undeniably watchable about both, Bloodsport most of all.. I had fond memories of it from my youth, and went into it expecting to be let-down dramatically, but I actually think I enjoyed it more than ever.  Its cheesy-as-hell in some parts, but there is an earnestness to it that really gives you the feeling the people involved in it were doing it for the love. The action is solid, the acting is good when it needs to be and laughably bad when it doesn't, giving the viewer some highly quotable lines to break up the kumite scenes.

Timecop was heralded as a classic JCVD movie, and I get what people like about it, but it overall didn't make me want to rewatch it anytime soon. It has decent action, slight gore (Sam Raimi's touch on it, no doubt), not so-bad-its-good dialogue, more just bad-is-bad overall, and remarkably decent effects for the time.  Again though, there is an earnestness to it all that hooks you to a degree and makes it a good watch on Bluray.  It also answers the long-pondered question, ""what does Ferris Bueller's girlfriend look like naked""?

The Bluray is what you'd expect it to be - a Bluray conversion of old, lower-budget flicks.  They don't look amazingly crisp, but they look pretty darn good for the source material, and they look better than you've ever seen them.  Add that both movies are priced extremely reasonably together, if you even have a slight love for either (and especially both), this is a no-brainer purchase.",1299196800,2,1663,4.710344827586207
