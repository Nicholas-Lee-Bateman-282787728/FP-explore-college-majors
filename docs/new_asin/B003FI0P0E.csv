8395981,5,B003FI0P0E,The 1st and 2nd graders in our Sunday school class love it! We were searching for some kind of worship starter before the lesson (as neither my co-teacher nor I have any musical ability). I met Jana years ago and heard her testimony in a Moms of Preschoolers group. So glad I remembered her ministry! Intend to order more of her DVDs..This one magic!,1447372800,,350,4.484375
