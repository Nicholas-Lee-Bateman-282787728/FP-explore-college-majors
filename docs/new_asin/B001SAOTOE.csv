8339562,5,B001SAOTOE,"Benny Meng is already a legend for me. He explains things clear and concise, still comprehensive. Wonderful source of information and trustworthy. I like the fact he has also trained outside wing chun, this gives him a much better and balanced view / perspective on wing chun.",1448928000,,276,4.8936170212765955

8339564,5,B001SAOTOE,"Great way to learn the wooden dummy form.  Several different video angles show you all the moves, and Benny Meng does a top-notch job of explaining the moves.  Great way to learn the dummy if you don't have the luxury of a Sifu that you train with locally.",1411171200,,256,4.3125
8339565,3,B001SAOTOE,"It is easy to follow, but I was looking for something that would go through the dummy training for beginners. It is hard to follow the dummy form being they are done at normal speed and aren't repeated or broken down for beginners to follow. I'm sure this will come in useful when I have actual learned and practiced down the line.",1396569600,,331,4.354838709677419
