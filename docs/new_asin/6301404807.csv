7812000,5,6301404807,"I remembered growing up watching Santa Bear's High flying Adventure and I had always loved watching that cartoon!  Now, imagine my surprise and delight when I found out that there was a cartoon out there that detailed how Santa Bear became Santa's little helper and how he met up with a little girl that taught him the wonders of the world and Santa Claus himself!  I will admit that if you were expecting the same type of animation that was found in Santa Bear's High Flying Adventure (meaning that you were expecting a fully animated special), then you might be disappointed that this special is not fully animated.  But, it is still a joy to watch if you are a huge fan of Rabbit Ears' stories type of animation.",1516060800,,715,4.5271317829457365

Music By Michael Hedges

We purchased the video to add to our Michael Hedges music library. Although we have enjoyed the music countless times before on his music CD's, It is a new experience to hear Michael's magic in a new context.",1098230400,6,318,4.7272727272727275
