4375244,5,B004H4XDI6,"in my 14 plus years journey alongside two precious sons on the spectrum, i found Lampposts affirming my belief that autism is less of a demon we must ""cast out"", but truly a blessing we all should embrace, seek ways to calm ourselves (yes) down, and only then will we hilariously celebrate this predictably unpredictable, yet amazingly teachable world of autism",1316304000,4,361,4.934426229508197
4375245,5,B004H4XDI6,"Though I think authors are taking official opinions very seriously about the causes of the autism, I liked the part about enjoying your child or other people with autism. Seeing autistic person as a gift, even if this gift comes with challenges. The  little boy loves lampposts, and his father says that love is what makes us human - and lots of autistic children have things they get fixated on(or are in love with). Therapists see it as a bad thing, just because most people don't do that - normal people get fixated on more normal things - like pleasing others, getting good grades, looking good, and ...looking normal to others.
  That said, this is not so much a movie about solutions.",1313366400,3,690,4.639344262295082
4375246,5,B004H4XDI6,"This film gives people a different way to view autism, not necessarily as a devastating condition, but rather as something one has to deal with.  They are not chasing some mythical ""cure"" but rather want to make the most of any person's strengths and cope with any disabilities.  They do an outstanding job of showing that the autism epidemic we hear so much about is unlikely to exist, as those we now call autistic have always been with us, just without a label.  They also so show a lot of the theories about autism that that have been put forward and discredited, as well as some of the miracle cures that are just high tech snake oil.  They present facts and let us draw our own conclusions without becoming confrontational.  The professionals included present their information well, without any agendas.  Many of the people in this film are truly fascinating, and some would be excellent subjects for a documentary on their own.  I particularly liked the autistic man who earned a doctorate in music and is now teaching music to other autistic persons.  I would love to hear more from him.
A couple minor points.  While I think they clearly show their view that all autistic persons are unique individuals, they tend to talk in terms of autism as a single entity, when I suspect we ultimately will find there are many distinct conditions, most likely with different etiologies that are now all included in the autism spectrum.  But since they don't see this as critical in dealing with people with autism, it's not that important. I might have liked them to be a little more direct about some of the nonsense that is seen in this field, and some of those profiting by exploiting people who feel desperate.  They also tended to avoid showing some of the severe challenges faced by many who live with an autistic child, though the TV program Parenthood does this quite well. Also I would have liked to have seen Dr. Temple Grandin in the film as she is one of the best people to talk on autism and her views about exploiting individual strengths would fit well here.  She also sees being autistic as a plus and necessary for all she has accomplished, which would also be in line with this film.  Overall an excellent film which all who have any interest in or relation to this field must see.",1305331200,,2297,4.614250614250614
4375247,3,B004H4XDI6,"This was a beautiful and important documentary.  The voices that come through on neurodiversity are poignant and memorable and it's an important message for the world to hear.  That being said I felt that this documentary was billed as a complete look at the spectrum of choices and I felt that it was incredibly biased.  The message to me was that if you don't accept your child, if you push for a cure or recovery you are saying there is something wrong with our children.  I'm sorry but what is the right way for you to handle this topic is not necessarily the right way for everyone.  The choices to represent recovery were flawed.  Using the quote about fixing homosexuality as compared to fixing autism represents the worst of the ""side"" striving for recovery.  The film maker's son and others interviewed seemed to fall into one category of the diagnosis spectrum.  It's a very different feeling when you have a child that wasn't autistic at birth, that experienced a regression (15-40% as listed in the latest review of symptom onset) and it changes how you view and deal with it.

Not fully demonstrating that much of the DAN protocols try to treat the GI issues that the film maker's son admittedly doesn't have and rather seeming to focus on the subject of biomedical recovery in a very superficial way is disingenuous and flies in the face of some quality science that is being done.  I could go into great detail about this but I had hoped for a more accurate representation of the biomedical aspects and also the claims of recovery by ABA. Floortime was praised and touted with subtle  jabs at ABA as something based on memorization whose sole intent is trying to make an ASD kid ""look"" normal.  Where were the voices of Catherine Maurice, Lynn Koegel, or Lovaas?  They too have striven to ""overcome"" autism and would clearly fit on the ""other side"".

I had hopes that this documentary was not going to be an either or proposition but rather a thorough examination of the topic. There is scientific validity to Dr. Bock's work and yet the comorbid illnesses that a portion of the ASD population faces was barely mentioned.  Many of use embrace difference in thinking and difference in being and yet seek recovery because something was lost that was there.  I understand that this is not the case in all circumstances.  But I would like a fairer representation of all sides. All issues have extremists and I felt that this documentary showed the best of neurodiversity, a concept whose time has come, but the worst of biomedical treatments... Another way of looking at some cases of autism whose time has come.  Thank you.",1301616000,10,2635,4.716157205240175
4375248,5,B004H4XDI6,"My son has autism, and it has been almost 4 years since we first realized there was something ""wrong"". I wish I had seen this movie then. It would have helped me immensely- not because it offers some kind of ""answer"" or guidelines, but because it shows many many aspects of living with autism, and how people respond to the situation. You will see several adults on the Autism Spectrum, with varying degrees of deficits. You will see how different parents chose to deal with their child's diagnosis, and you will see different views held by the the medical and academic community.
The central issue is to highlight the two main schools of thought on the topic of Autism: on the one end of the spectrum is ""Defeat Autism Now"", on the other is the ""Neuro-Diversity"" movement.
The film is informative, personal (the director's son has Autism), compassionate, and deeply moving.
Personally, I found it very very helpful to hear the stories and to hear others echo the very struggles that I went through, and continue to deal with.",1301529600,17,1026,4.737430167597766
4375249,5,B004H4XDI6,"I just finished watching the DVD given to me by a friend who had a review copy.

This film explores the complexity and diversity of autism experiences by interviewing many adults with autism, as well as parents of children with autism and autism experts.  It is a wonderful, reassuring view of autism, especially useful for parents whose children may be newly diagnosed with autism.

Drezner also interviews advocates for biomedical treatment or ""curing autism"" in a fair and balanced manner.

Loving Lampposts has the tagline ""if you've met one autistic person, you've met one autistic person"" and and brings it to life by interviewing many people with autism--in particular, tackling the issue of ""high functioning vs. low functioning"" in a sensitive and nuanced manner.

If you want to help yourself and others better understand autism, watch this film.  I think you'll join me in recommending  Loving Lampposts to others.",1301356800,16,925,5.167785234899329
4375250,5,B004H4XDI6,"I saw this film at a screening and was deeply moved by it.  The filmmaker sensitively portrays the process of parents coming to terms with their childrens' diagnoses, beginning with his own experience as the parent of an autistic boy.  He shies away from easy answers or simple solutions, instead telling the stories of autistic children and adults--and the people who love and care for them--with tenderness and dignity.  I recommend it especially to parents of children who have been recently diagnosed, as well as to anybody who works with people with disabilities.",1295395200,24,568,5.086021505376344
4375251,3,B004H4XDI6,"The boy is cute. The topic is old. And kinda somewhat ridiculous though. I mean do shots cause autism? It's been proven now they don't. In fact, the researcher who announced it originally lost his license as a doctor and researcher. And has had charges against him. And court time where he was found GUILTY.",1410652800,,307,4.6
4375252,5,B004H4XDI6,"I loved this movie.  What a refreshing departure from the panic and tragedy rhetoric that so many other media choose to use.  This is the first documentary my husband and I watched after our son's diagnosis, and I'm so glad of that.  I'd highly recommend it!",1410480000,2,258,4.565217391304348

4375255,5,B004H4XDI6,"As a grandmother of a child just diagnosed with autism, I was very encouraged by this documentary.  It was helpful in explaining the differing views of what autism is and how it is treated.  I would recommend it to anyone who interacts with children with autism -- including family members, friends, teachers.",1380758400,4,309,4.923076923076923
4375256,2,B004H4XDI6,"We have a son on the spectrum as high-functioning, yet we wish we had the information we know today about Autism that would've saved him and us a lot of grief and hardship that made life very difficult when he was a baby. Our son is now 10 years old, and what we know now about Autism butts heads with public education and mainstream society. This movie is a collection of interviews featuring Autistic adults and children, arguing that Autism is a disease needing a cure. This diagnosis seems to be outdated, as current data is showing that Autism is not a disease but a Variant. In this movie, they claim health issues like Leaky Gut Syndrome cause Autism, but the latest Tensor Imaging is showing Autism is more a gift and variant than a disability or a child with special needs. Watch any of the Temple Grandin movies, along with the TED talk she gave in Feb 2010 (www.ted.com) showing compelling evidence that Autism is begging us to think out of the box, esp. with how we educate them. Autistics see details we don't see, and this is key to how we as parents and educators have much to learn about how we write curriculum and school testing that isn't compatible with how they see the world. I believe we are at the very beginning of understanding the human brain with variants like Autism that have never been considered because it seems much easier to diagnose them as disabled and diseased, rather than allowing for variation and the specially gifted. It is estimated that 50% of all the engineers and developers in SIlicon Valley are on the Autism Spectrum, which includes Asperger's. I worked at Bell Laboratories for 14 years and I can tell you there were similar numbers of Autism Spectrum physicists and scientists there as well. The point I'm making is: these kids need help discovering their gifts, and need the practical, hands-on learning so as to be building and making things with their hands instead of all this abstract stuff society and schools are pressuring them to do.",1370649600,6,1994,4.667613636363637
4375257,5,B004H4XDI6,"This movie is so inspiring. I have to premise this review by stating that my son is on the Autism Spectrum, so I watched this movie through that filter.  Being new to the world of Autism, one is bombarded with misinformation, especially from the Internet, and pressure to ""find a cure.""  I began to feel like an outsider in the world of parents with kids on the Spectrum, because I didn't want to supplement or chelate my son in the hopes of ""curing"" him.  I just want to understand him and offer him all the love and support he needs to grow into a happy, healthy adult.  This movie opens your eyes to what adults with Autism experience and throws the blanket off the world of adults with Autism, showing us who they are and how they live every day.  It gives you hope for what your child can someday be.  It teaches you not to assume, not to underestimate.  Watch this movie.",1368144000,,877,4.343558282208589
4375258,4,B004H4XDI6,"Asks a lot of questions more then anything else. I do like how it showed how several different autistic people lived. It showed the saying you've meet one autistic person, you've meet one. Not everyone functions at the same level.",1368057600,,230,4.775
4375259,5,B004H4XDI6,"This movie was suggested to me by a mother of a non-verbal child. I was trained and worked as a therapist with both non-verbal and high functioning children with autism. The message you bring away is an important one. We shouldn't be worried as much about trying to make them normal as in loving them for who they are and developing with them a good relationship in which they can thrive and join us more and more in our world as we join them in theirs. They are not flawed just different, beautiful, unique and very worth the time and energy and love we need to give them to help them thrive.",1365724800,,593,4.303571428571429
4375260,5,B004H4XDI6,This movie was truly heart warming and a wonderful movie about a little boys love for lampposts and his parents devotion for him. I really enjoyed the movie and hope more people will buy it and watch it.,1363478400,,203,4.368421052631579
4375261,5,B004H4XDI6,"Personally I believe there are many people out there who behaviorally and genetically fall on the spectrum, but adapt to their differences well enough to go un-diagnosed.  I believe some even experience extremes of success in life because of their ability to focus on their passions.  I believe more would succeed if they didn't spend quite so much time and energy trying to conform to a way of being that does not come naturally to them.  This documentary makes the case for accepting neuro-diversity and recognizing the value of some of the positives of autism.  Maybe the world can be adapted a bit for those with autism instead of expecting those with autism to do all the adapting.  It is quite refreshing.",1362096000,8,711,4.795081967213115
4375262,5,B004H4XDI6,"This movie isn't the type that would offer you answers/solutions to ""fix"" your child on the spectrum. Instead it's a film that shows you that you have a child in front of you to love and cherish.
I have a child with Autism and I loved seeing the adults who are on the spectrum and everything that they face.
I've watched many documentaries on Autism and this one is a definite must-see. Loved it.
I saw that someone posted that it was the first documentary that they watched and that it was confusing. I showed this to my family who haven't seen any documentaries on Autism and they loved it and understood every thing completely, but if you're a first timer I would also recommend ""A Mothers Courage: talking back to autism"". Both are great.",1360195200,2,742,4.503703703703704
4375263,5,B004H4XDI6,"When my 1 year old (now 3) was diagnosed with autism after months of showing signs, I had NO idea what autism meant. Now, I NEVER bought into the whole ""gluten cures it, vaccines are bad, they're full of metals and mushrooms"" BS. But... sadly I will admit I was in the ""normalizing"" mindset. The first time we watched Loving Lampposts, we had just fired my daughter's therapist for screaming at her for not acting normal. I was sick of hearing her constantly say, ""She has to do these things so she will be socially acceptable.""

Guess what - autism makes people different - and Loving Lampposts says, ""You know what, guys, there is no *cure*... and why would you want to cure this?"" This documentary says, ""Autistic people are not retarded. They are not stupid. They have no intelligence deficiencies. They just communicate differently and have different priorities.""

If you want to help your child with autism, get on their level. See through their eyes. Listen to what they have to say. Do things their way. Build a relationship. That's what Loving Lampposts taught me. Thank you for this documentary.",1358121600,20,1105,4.780104712041885
4375264,5,B004H4XDI6,"After working with kids with Autism since 2008 and preparing to finish my Masters in ABA Therapy and Autism, I recently viewed this film after having it on my radar for over a year.  It's a very earnest look at the many perspectives of living with Autism from family to people who adapt to it's various individual symptoms in their daily lives.  It softened and deepened my opinions on its causes, challenges and the therapies that strive to help people live life to their fullest.  It is interesting to see the main family's progress and adaptation as I knew them before they got married and had their son.",1357603200,,607,4.601851851851852
4375265,5,B004H4XDI6,"Loving Lampposts is a thoughtful and intelligent documentary by Todd Drezner about autism, neurodiversity, society's viewpoint of the diagnosis and how that impacts the way we treat autistic individuals, both medically and personally.

Drezner's son Sam, was diagnosed with PDD-NOS as a toddler, which is a diagnosis encompassing autism-like features. Sam seems to be an easy-going child, although quirky and not very social. (I won't say ""high functioning"", because the film offers a thought provoking conversation on that term.) The film's title comes from Sam's early special interest in and connection to a group of lampposts near his home. Visiting the lampposts is an important ritual for Sam as a child.

But the film is much more than a look at one family's experience with their special needs child. Drenzer thoughtfully examines the big questions about whether autism is an illness to be cured or a difference to be accepted. In his interview with Steve Silberman of the blog Neurotribes, Drenzer discusses how he views autism as a difference as well as a disability. I appreciate this realistic and still respectful stance. In the documentary, Drenzer manages to interview many of the big names in autism science, such as Simon Baron-Cohen, and Paul Offit. He talks to parents of autistic children, like AutismVox blogger Christina Chew, and author Roy Grinker, and autism Playboy Bunny Jenny McCarthy.

The most exciting group in the film is the widely diverse group of autistic adults represented. So often the focus of research, treatment and policy is on children, leaving autistic adults as the forgotten majority. Drenzer talks to artist Dora Raymaker of AASPIRE, Sharisa Joy Kochmeister of AutCom, author Stephen Shore, as well as others. The film celebrate the gifts these individuals bring, while not ignoring their difficulties.

Loving Lampposts is entertaining and informative, well worth watching.",1332460800,4,1921,5.33003300330033
4375266,3,B004H4XDI6,"The production of this DVD was presented very professionally, but the information was so all over the place it was extremely hard to watch and comprehend most of it, much less have something concrete to take and apply to our own situation with our autistic grandson. If a person new to autism were to watch this (such as us), they walk away so confused by theories/viewpoints being blended with info/facts to the point one does not know what is what. I purchased this with the impression we were actually going to gain understanding from the parents of the little boy that loved lampposts, however, again...I say all of this theory/viewpoint was the main presentation.

4375270,5,B004H4XDI6,"I really loved this documentary and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in autism. I found the film enlightening because it tried to present a balanced view of autism and the different strategies that are being offered or employed to deal with this condition. The difficulty in presenting a documentary of this type is having to face the fact that we still don't know what causes autism. There is an abundance of theories, but no conclusive answers. An approach that works for one child might not work for another. And this is pointed out in the film where the director talks about the whole spectrum of autistic disorders, from high functioning autism (Asperger's syndrome) to the most profound cases. Each individual case has to be treated very differently. The debate about the medical approach (to cure autism) and the neurodiversity approach (the acceptance approach) was interesting, but I feel the need to point out that whichever approach a person is inclined to adhere to, I think all parents of autistic children should strive to help their child acquire the highest level of functioning they are capable of. I think they owe their child that much. And on a personal note, I do not--and never have--thought of autism as a disease. I felt somewhat troubled that this was even mentioned in the film. But I guess they were just trying to present a balanced view.

Overall, I thought this was a beautifully written and well-filmed documentary. The adult autistics who were interviewed were treated with respect and dignity. And I personally loved the director's little boy, Sam. He was so adorable in his little hat. And I think it was great that they were so supportive of the boy in his desire to visit the lampposts. This was obviously something that was very important to the child, so to deprive him of this interaction would have--in my opinion--done more harm than good. Although I do not have children of my own, I do not write this review from a void. I have a B.S. Degree in Child Development, with an area of specialization in ""The psychology of child and family interaction and how the interaction is affected by conflicting personalities and abnormal behavior patterns."" So my review is no doubt influenced by my views relative to the importance of human interaction in situations of this nature. (That's my reason for presenting this bit of personal information. I apologize if this seemed intrusive to anyone.) But I really hope that everyone will watch this film. If you are like me, you will certainly come away being more informed and enlightened about autism than before.",1317513600,5,2612,4.856502242152466
