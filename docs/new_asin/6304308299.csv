Ah yes the film that would see the Leprechaun is space. That statement alone should be enough to get anyone to want to check this out. When this film was first released I was so excited because I didn't want the third one to the last. They had did a such a good job with that one I wanted to see where he would go next, and space it was. Luckily Brian Trenchard-Smith returned to direct so I was all kinds of happy about that. This time the script would be done by Kickboxer 3 writer Dennis A. Pratt and I thought the two of them together created a really fun flick.

It wasn't as funny as the last film but it was really close and was more action pack since it had the space marines.  There is one scene in particular that is just excellent and any one that has seen this can tell which one that is. Also I really enjoyed the acting in this one from everyone, most times with these films it is hit and miss with the actors. Warwick Davis is brilliant as always as are all the soldiers especially the leader, dude is funny [even as a woman, wait and see]. The of course the two scientists with the boss there being very creepy.

The sets are cool and the film is a good funny Alien like story and moves at a great pace. The action is good and while the CGI isn't great I still enjoy the flick. This is another great film in the series that I recommend to anyone looking for a good fun flick. Now I must move on to the next, although I think I already reviewed Leprechaun in the Hood so Back to the Hood it is.",1414713600,,1523,4.04983388704319

Hooker (apparently they couldn't get Henry Rollins to put on a metal wig) is leading a troop on a search and destroy mission against a meddlesome alien. Who could that be? Who the F do you think it is? Actually, I had no idea it would be the Leprechaun. Seems like kind of a random plot point. They go into some space caves on Planet Ithacan to destroy the ""alien.""

One of the soldiers, let's call him Bill Paxton, takes a leak on one of the remaining bits, and develops some sort of space gonorrhea. Cut to the ship mixer, where he's getting it on with Delores, the crew tramp. Here's something I don't see often in movies: Boner-related death.

838517,1,6304308299,"The first 3 Lep movies where ok. But this one, oh man...

PLOT
Leppy is (for some unknown reason) living on another planet and he has kidnapped some sort of alien-princess who he intends to marry to make himself king and then do away with her once he has the power. But marines come along and wreck Leps day when they blow him away and rescue his bride-to-be. Leppy regenerates on a space ship where the marines and a bunch of science guys are the crew, and of coarse starts killing them off in search of his bride-to-be, oh and his gold as usual. The marines fight back and blah blah blah.

OPINION
This movie sucks so badly on so many levels. Firstly the acting; Warrick Davis plays the Lep character just as well as he always has, it's just a shame he's been given some really crappy lines to say. Even tho Warrick is bringing the same character, he doesn't fit in well with the bad dialog and speech of the other zany characters in this film. The German doctor is a combination of German stereotypes, something like a combination between Hitler and Siegfried (Get Smart) with a lot of Corporal Clinger thrown together for one giant annoying voice and bad acting from the actor, who keeps letting his English accent slip through far too often. The Marine captain is a joke gone terribly wrong. You cant even laugh at how bad it is, it's just horrible and pathetic. The other actors are somewhat trying to act, but they're not going to have many future roles offered to them from this movie if they show this one on their resume's, thats for sure. I recognized one of them from Jason Takes Manhattan and he must be kicking himself he's been in two stinker horror flicks. The leading roles are a guy and a girl who you just won't care for and will be lucky if they ever have a starring role ever again after this.

EFFECTS: The effects are terrible. There is no death scene worth looking at here, 'cause they are all 'cut-away', shadow, kind of things meant to leave to your imagination, 'cause they think its better that way, but really it's because they spent all the money on the crappy CGI effects they put in.

I wouldn't even say the special effects of this movie where up to childrens television standards. They where REALLY bad effects. The opening scene of them landing on the planet during a thunderstorm around them as it pans to a cave they will stay in are super-dooper-BAD effects. I guess in 1997 they could claim the CGI technology wasn't so good... but who are they kidding??? these graphics looked knocked up in about 5 minutes even for 1997 standards. Not to forget pointing out the unnecessary nudity of a women who flashes her breasts (that aren't worth looking at) because on her planet that is how her people give you the their version of the ""kiss of death"" ... uh-huh, more like brainless producers adding something they THINK will take your mind off the bad acting going on.

Even at the end of the movie, for absolutely no reason what-so-ever, the heroine loses her pants and runs around in a one piece swimsuit... gimme a break, it's just PATHETIC to throw that in for the hell of it. It WONT attract ANYONE but a desperate 12 year old who is not old enough to by porn and his parents have installed 'net-nanny' on his computer. It's so lame. IT DOESN'T ADD ANYTHING TO THE MOVIE it takes it away.

No bonus features, thank god. I wouldn't have watched them anyhow. There is just the trailers of part 1, 2, 3 and 5.
This is the worst in the Leprechaun series. This whole movie should have been cut down to an hour and been a TV episode of some lame-horror show they would put on somewhere. Not good enough for The Twilight Zone or Tales From The Crypt..hell, not even Freddy's Nightmares! It wasn't scary and I wouldn't say there is any form of gore anywhere in the movie. Maybe they could make it an episode of Goosebumps seeing as how PG rated the whole thing is without the nudity that should be cut out for being the most useless and pathetic scene in the whole film. THATS WHAT GAVE IT AN R-RATING???...JUST THAT PATHETIC LITTLE UN-NEEDED SCENE?!?!?!?!?!?!? If that scene was to be cut out, its PG13!

If any of the actors in this film ever caught a leprechaun, their first wish would be that they would wish they could go back and say no to making this movie.

I cant dismiss it as the worst thing I've ever seen tho, I didn't get tired and want to turn it off, I did keep watching it, just to see how bad and lame it would get... and it didn't fail to satisfy that need.

I give it one and a half stars.",1149292800,2,4539,4.387633769322235

838520,3,6304308299,"This review refers to the edition found in Trimark's ""Leprechaun: Pot of Gore Collection"" boxed set.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Warwick Davis, Brent Jasmer, Jessica Collins, Tim Colceri, Miguel A. Nunez Jr., Debbe Dunning, Gary Grossman, Rebekah Carlton, Rick Peters, Geoff Meed, Michael Cannizzo, Ladd York, Guy Siner. Score Composed By Dennis Michael Tenney. Directed By Brian Trenchard-Smith. (R) For Violence, Very Mild Gore, Profanity, Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 95m.; 1996.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Most of the filmmakers who took the nasty little Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) to Las Vegas have returned to put him in outer space for this fourth entry in the long running series. Somewhere in the future, a team of marines arrive on the planet Ithacon to save the beautiful Princess Zarina (Rebekah Carlton) from a loathsome alien menace (our homicidal anti-hero) who wants to wed her so he can rule the universe as a king. Somewhere along the line, the mission's priorities are changed by the shifty Dr. Mittenhand (Guy Siner) who has a more scientific purpose in mind for the rescued princess. There's a variety of new elements being added to this sequel; some of them work while others fall horribly flat. The worst aspects come from contrived plot points involving genetic experimentation and flat, lackluster settings that make the production feel unnecessarily claustrophobic. Even the Leprechaun's lair in the opening moments of the movie feels tiny and cramped, unlike the beseeming scope of the one utilized in ""Leprechaun 2"". Another disheartening fact is Dennis Michael Tenney's score. One would think it would have been impossible for him to create a backdrop more bland than the one he composed for part three of the franchise, however he proves it can be done with this humdrum hack. Fortunately for die hard ""Leprechaun"" fanatics, the best aspects of the film far outweigh the drawbacks. The agreeably corny one-liners prove that director Brian Trenchard-Smith hasn't abandoned the taste for lunatic comedy he displayed in ""Leprechaun 3"". Gabe Bartalos has done another wonderful job on the Leprechaun's make-up, not to mention the superb craftsmanship he displays on another monstrous creation during the latter half of the film. But the highlight of this entry is the underappreciated cast who put more effort into the movie than it probably deserves. Jessica Collins is a delight as Dr. Tina Reeves, overshadowing Lee Armstrong's leading lady role from the prior film. Brent Jasmer is personable enough in his role as Sergeant ""Books"" Malloy, he just doesn't have the overwhelming natural charisma John Gatins had in ""Leprechaun 3"". Rebekah Carlton is good as the Dominian Princess Zarina while veteran actor Miguel A. Nunez Jr. turns in another venerable performance as Sticks, adding to his list of horror credentials. Guy Siner makes a fair Dr. Mittenhand, but often times Gary Grossman steals scenes as Mittenhand's assistant Harold. The best support is provided by Tim Colceri as Sergeant Hooker. His transformation from a metal head marine into a transvestite assassin has to be seen to be believed. While the new cast stands out in this one, Warwick Davis' acting is old hat. He doesn't shimmer with the brilliant enjoyment he displayed in the previous three films. He's not exactly bored by the proceedings either, just overly familiar with the material he's been given. Overall, this is a fairly solid entry in a series that was slowly losing ground. With each passing installment, the filmmakers had to rely on new gimmicks to lure fans back to the franchise. While the addition of a space motif was a novel approach, true ""Leprechaun"" fans would have been just as happy to see our malicious villain stalking his victims back on Earth in a film more reminiscent of the first two entries.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.33:1 full screen for this film is the clearest presentation to grace a ""Leprechaun"" DVD yet, although its clarity does betray the monetary limitations of some of its special effects. Still, the colors are intense, flesh tones appear natural and black levels are deep and even. The accompanying audio track is full and bright, especially for a regular stereo sound track. There is also a Spanish language track on this film as well as English, Spanish and French subtitles. Subtitles are off-white in color and are fairly easy to read. The front cover for this DVD finds the beastly Leprechaun hovering in space with white/green lightning shooting forth from one of his fingers. Beneath him is a vehicular module next to a small American flag, both residing on the surface of some darkened, bleak outer space world. The back cover sports a bevy of photographs, information pertaining to the film and the twenty-four chapter stops which separate this ninety-five minute movie. The DVD itself is a silver-topped affair imprinted with the title of the film as well as other small bits of data. Opposite the disc is the exact same ""Trimark DVD: The Ultimate in Home Entertainment"" booklet that has bedecked the inner case of each previous entry to the series. Much like the other ""Leprechaun"" films, the only special feature found here is the original trailer (1:35) which is fairly funny and gives an accurate representation of the film's contents.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: It's not much of a hidden feature, but it'll have to do. On the main menu for this disc, highlight the Trimark symbol in the lower right hand corner. You'll have access to trailers for the films ""Leprechaun"" (2:01), ""Leprechaun 2"" (1:16), ""Leprechaun 3"" (1:04), and ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" (once again displayed as ""Leprechaun 5"") (1:57).

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Viewers get to see former ""Home Improvement"" actress Debbe Dunning (as Delores) strut her stuff on the dance floor in a silver tank top and a pair of shorts. She also mimes milking one of her breasts before exiting for a tryst with her boyfriend Kowalski (Geoff Meed). We then get a few brief glimpses of her lovely breasts encased in a bra as she ""shakes hands with the big guy"". A vision of a nude Tina Reeves (Jessica Collins) appears outside a laboratory door, unfortunately Collins doesn't show anything revealing. That's a shame considering how enthralling she is. At least salacious viewers are treated to a few shots of her fine backside in tight clothing throughout the duration of the film. As an extra bonus, during the last act, Collins gets stripped of her red pants and spends the rest of the movie running around in a pair of little black panties. For those disappointed by the lack of nudity on Dunning or Collins' part, Princess Zarina (Rebekah Carlton) does give a very long view of her small but magnificent bosom just over an hour into the film.

THE GORE REPORT: In the early going, an alien life form gets fragged by an overanxious space marine, leaving quite an interesting carcass. One marine is reduced to a skeleton after encountering some flesh eating bacteria, though it's not a particularly gory scene. There are a few more smatterings of gore in other scenes, but there's nothing really worthwhile for cinematic bloodhounds to drool over.

SAY AGAIN: ""Listen, you little pencil-necked geek! You give me the doctor...now, before I jerk out your teeth and sh*t down your throat!"" - Sergeant Hooker (Tim Colceri). ""Thank you, I've already had my lunch."" - Harold (Gary Grossman).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. It's always a risky proposition to take an established horror character into the far reaches of outer space. While this fourth film doesn't live up to the expectations set by the original trilogy, it does feature some hilarious moments and should please anyone looking for a halfway decent time killer.

838614,1,6304308299,"""Leprechaun 4"" is the type of film that only the most learned, metaphysically hardy individuals should watch. As I sat in my easy chair, buffeted by the splendorous emanations pouring out of the television screen and speakers, I pondered whether my mind could handle the multifaceted plot, canyon deep characters, whipsaw fast pacing, and dialogue that surely issued from the mouth of that most benevolent deity watching over each and every one of us from his throne in the stars. Seriously, I am just funning around. We all know, as anyone who has sacrificed ninety minutes of his or her life to watch this dullsville production knows, that this movie reeks to high heaven. ""Leprechaun 4"" boasts Debbe Dunning, a group of space marines, and the actor who played that geeky guy in ""Bachelor Party,"" the one with the huge glasses that lined up the female entertainment for the Tom Hanks character's hotel bash. Why doesn't ""Leprechaun 4"" work in any way, shape, or form? Because it boasts Debbe Dunning, a group of space marines, and the actor who played that geeky guy in ""Bachelor Party,"" the one with the huge glasses that lined up the female entertainment for the Tom Hanks character's hotel bash. ""Leprechaun 4"" ought to come with a syringe full of Thorazine because that's the only way anyone will get through this one without significant mental scarring.
At some point in the future, a group of space marines (a blatant rip-off of ""Aliens,"" obviously, but who cares at this point?) ends up battling the leprechaun we know so well from the previous three installments when they act as a security detail for a creepy doctor doing genetics research on another planet. Why the evil elf is now on another world wooing some blonde ditz who just happens to be an alien princess from a powerful kingdom is another matter and one I refuse to discuss in any detail. The squad of celestial jarheads includes a sergeant with a bizarre, transparent plate in his head and Debbe Dunning in the ""I'matoughchickdon'tmesswithme"" role that has been done to death in recent years. Along for the ride is a super hot blonde scientist, yet another clich beaten into the ground in countless movies. This scientist, who I will call Dr. Tina Reeves because that's her name, banters arthritically with a hunky marine because the two must hook up at some point during the movie and they cannot do so if they get along initially. Another clich. This movie is absolutely bursting at the seams with clichs. It's as though the screenwriter took a bottle of white out, splashed it over selected parts of an ""Alien"" movie script, and typed some junk over the top of it. The trite screenplay continues to plumb the depths of rip-off when we meet the rest of the marines, all of them carbon copies of characters we've seen a million times in other movies. Even the weird doctor with a German accent who turns out to be a cheesy half human/half robot character was so formulaic that I thought about filing a lawsuit on behalf of Dr. Strangelove.
The arrival of the leprechaun, still played by Warwick Davis, fails to salvage any part of this film because the little man is always saddled with an annoyingly terrible actress playing an evil space princess. The plot has the two planning to marry and take over planets, or some such nonsense, making for a very dull and lifeless jaunt through the confines of the spaceship as the leprechaun and the marines attack each other. At one point, the gruff, manly sergeant turns up for a bump and grind number in drag. This scene is so painful to watch that I am embarrassed to even write about it in a review. I recognize actors will do almost anything in a film because it is usually better than getting a real job, but this is just pure agony on a level rarely imagined. Fortunately, most of these cookie cutter characters die in painful ways: someone gets chewed up by flesh eating bacteria, a crotch explodes, someone takes a dive off of a platform, and a mutated spider/scorpion/German doctor creature chews up a few other people. The scenes with this horrible monstrosity provide the only admirable trait this movie possesses, and even then it fails because we only see the scorpion type beastie in the final moments of the movie. Be sure and pay attention to the atrocious special effects used on the exterior shots of the space ship. Who did the graphics work in this film? The guy who invented Pong? ""Leprechaun 4"" is one of the worst pictures I have seen in at least a week.
At least this movie still has Warwick Davis doing his shtick as the icky sprite. Unfortunately, the overwhelming amount of awfulness in the movie significantly dilutes his effectiveness. As far as the DVD goes, it is the usual Trimark ""Leprechaun"" release, with a few trailers and a good picture transfer. Even diehard ""Leprechaun"" fans, which I am not even though I recently watched all five entries in the franchise, should stay away from this blasphemy. I would recommend ""Leprechaun 5"" over this turkey any day, and that is really saying something.

The movie was simply pointless and oh yeh, the special effects... were even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs... If you want to see a really well-done, huge-budget horror flick in outer space, then rent Jason X, which is very entertaining. I love it.",1036713600,2,622,4.612612612612613

The horrible production is the only thing even slightly entertaining.  The space planet looks like cardboard and you can see the duct tape hanging off the space suits.  It's so stupid, not funny, and just plain horrible.  But if you want to see the whole series, this is one of them... so you are forced to watch this one too.

7867576,2,6304308299,"With sequels, the stakes tend to get bigger with each subsequent story.  Whereas Leprechaun (1993) had nothing of the sort, Leprechaun 2 (1994) boasted three wishes granted to a Leprechaun's captor and his search for a bride, and Leprechaun 3 (1995) offered infectious Leprechaunthropy!  How do we up the ante from there?  How about going to space???

The writing is absolutely the worst in the series (so far anyway), not that there's any surprise about that.  This entire movie looks like a space porno parody.  Cheap space porno sets, stale space porno acting, wretched space porno special effects, and the Leprechaun even wields a light saber!  Parts 2 and 3 were at least enjoyable for their silliness, but this just hurts to watch.  It's far beyond stupid.

A group of colonial marines a la Aliens (1986) prepare to seek and destroy an alien life form responsible for stealing from their employer's space mine yield.  Hmmmm, I wonder who the alien is and what they're mining?

When we meet our Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) he is wooing a space princess (Rebecca Carlton; Baywatch) dressed as a belly dancer complete with stripper glitter and a spiked bra.  Much classier than our past iterations of this monstrous Irish species, he pulls out champagne and marriage proposals to position himself for a family career in mine management.

After being left for dead by marines, our Leprechaun magically impregnates himself into a man's crotch, who later gives birth to him through his penis (no gore or latex) with just bad enough timing to prevent us from seeing a fine space marine's (Debbe Dunning; Home Improvement) boobs.

Cheap horror normally offers only two things: boobs and blood.  There's a general shortage of both here--minimal gore and one brief boob flash that is exactly that, a deliberate boob flash by the character.  Asinine!

The extent of the special effects is limited to magical sparks, three exploding Leprechaun scenes and a rubber monster suit when someone is mutated into an insectoid monster and pretty much steals the show.

As laughable as this sounds, take note that in four years the world has witnessed as many Leprechaun movies!  So if we the movie-going people disapprove, we're not exactly voting that opinion with our movie-buying dollar.  I love cheap horror and all, but this has become too destitute to support.

Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (Night of the Demons 2, Leprechaun 3) had taken all of the already-shaky-at-best rules of evil Leprechauns and thrown them out the window to bring us the story of a short, ugly, wizard with humbly moderate powers aiming to become a robber baron miner thorugh marriage.  In fact, the mutant spider monster felt like more of a menace than the Leprechaun.  My how far the franchise has fallen.

The director of one of these fine films once suggested that each Leprechaun movie was about a different Leprechaun, which is the only sensible notion in the entire series considering that we have seen three Leprechauns meet horrible deaths in  three states (South Dakota, California and Nevada) and now two solar systems.  If only this Leprechaun could have been the last of its mythological species.  But alas, such creatures of folklore have yet to befall ""da hood"" in, YES, a yet 5th installment in this series.  I rue the day I have to sit through that!

Outside of a few pleasantly recognizable faces, among those not yet mentioned were Miguel A. Nez Jr. (Return of the Living Dead) and Jessica Collins (The Young and the Restless), this movie has no redeeming qualities even in the realm of bad B-movies.  Don't ever watch it!",1467158400,,3608,4.935323383084577
7867577,4,6304308299,"Released to video in 1997, Leprechaun 4: In Space takes place in the future where a group of space marines travel to a distant planet to stop a power-hungry Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) from harming a Dominian princess, Zarina (Rebecca Carlton). The Marines civilian boss is a mad scientist by the name of Dr. Mittenhand (Guy Siner). When the Leprechaun eventually manifests on the vessel havoc ensues. Brent Jasmer and Tim Colceri play the main Marines while Jessica Collins plays a scientist who accompanies them. Debbe Dunning and Gary Grossman are also on hand.

Ive only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this is my second favorite after Leprechaun 3. As a low-budget horror/comedy, you have to take it for what it is to appreciate it. Davis is thoroughly entertaining as usual as the eponymous imp and the filmmakers assembled a quality cast who take it all tongue-in-cheek. The Leprechaun rebirth scene is particularly effective, both funny and perverse. The way Dr. Mittenhand de-morphs is also done well while Carlton & Collins are definite highlights as Princess Zarina and Tina.

The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot at Front Street Studios, Los Angeles.
