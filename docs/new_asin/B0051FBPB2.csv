8452596,5,B0051FBPB2,"This Is an Important DVD for ANY Gong fan. 1968-1975 was/is the prime years for David Allen fans (earlier if you dig the Soft Machine..) and for understandable reasons, there is almost ZERO footage available for that period in Gong History. Thats what makes this DVD so great..Its WAY to short, but I'll most likely watch this 1,000 times and more because it's the only one like it.",1439856000,,382,4.632352941176471
8452597,3,B0051FBPB2,"There's only one song on this entire DVD with the classic lineup (Allen, Malherbe, Hillage, Moerlin, Blake, Howlett, Smythe) of the teapot trilogy. So that's disappointing. However, you do get a real glimpse of the idealism behind Gong, its philosophy and anarchy and surrealism all being lived out in rural southern France (1972). The remaining four songs are ok. At least Bloomdido is in all the clips; and Daevid is always in fine form.",1378080000,,439,4.945945945945946
8452598,5,B0051FBPB2,"A truly priceless / vintage look at the very early days of Gong. An essential must-own DVD that, I for one would have never hoped nor even dreamed of even seeing a title such as this one in existence + so easily available. Five never-before-seen Gong performances. First, there's the twenty-five minute ""I Never Glid Before / I Am Your P*ssy"", one Gong tune that I simply don't seem to remember right off hand ""Never Fight Another War"" and ""Dreamin' It"" where the sound and picture quality is 100% pristine and in beautiful / stunning full color - I never knew that vocalist / space whisper Goddess - Gilli Smyth looked THIS hot. You have to see this clip - where other Gong members Daevid Allen, Didier Malherbe, bassist Christian Tritsch (I'm not familiar with this Gong musician) are clearly at their peak. Then there's two more commonly known Gong tunes - from 1972 ""Dynamite"" which is is B&W where the group members are acting like toy figures - overall a very eccentric performance. Last but not least we get to see ""Fohat Digs Holes In Space"". If you're an old Gong fan, you need to get this DVD. If you're a new fan, you should certainly lure yourself into experience all this 'wonderfully insane' cosmic weirdness.",1339286400,3,1223,4.640552995391705
8452599,4,B0051FBPB2,"Yes,Gong at some of their earliest eras!

But 55 minutes only.  You have to be the judge if you are ""fan"" enough to really need this.  I certainly think that the quality of picture is fine,counting out the age of this video....but as no one knew much about the band then, there are some bad mixes on vocals,.....and yet some of the performances are very wild and singular. A Jazz Show jam that starts a bit shakey...and builds to a mesmerizing ending is one priceless clip. Another is a very ""da da"" clip for ""Dynamite"" with all sorts of crazy happenings going on as the band play for a group of ""dignified ladies"" with parasols!

Great to see this,...and the mini documentary that starts it all off is quite fun,....but oh that time length.  I was very happy with this,....but those who are not from planet Gong?  Hmmmm...?

By the way,most of this is in Black & White also.",1312588800,3,875,4.465408805031447
