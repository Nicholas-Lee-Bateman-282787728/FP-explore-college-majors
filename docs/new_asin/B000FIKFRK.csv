2567951,4,B000FIKFRK,"A love story between an African American/Christian girl and an Arabic Muslim man, and the racial division between the two different cultures. This movie is a much purchase. This movie talks about issues that are tabu in our communities among blacks and Arabs such as interacial relationships.  I think this movie is well worth the buy.",1266883200,2,335,4.982142857142857
2567952,5,B000FIKFRK,"I read different reviews before purchase, for the price I decided to take the chance. I suggest that people should see and hear the message that this movie gives. The different cultures, the races and the reason why they couldn't get along. I am an African-American female and I am blessed that I was raised in a family that didn't judge  to like or dislike a person because of their race, trust me in my time that was very hard. I was born in 1954 and that time was very hard, but my family teaching helped through all the race comments that I received. In this movie it even showed a minister, a man of God, it showed interesting comments about his thoughts. I loved this movie, because I understood the message it was trying to get over.and as adverse as our country is it's not time to judge the acting skills, the actors or anything of the source, just look pass all that and look at the message(not saying any of those things were bad) I just want you to look and listen to the message. Through the hard times I endured, I can smile this day I know Mexican-American kids that are friends of kids in my family call me Aunt,and kids in my family don't understand why they are tagged because of what they wear, I showed them the movie
I think this a great movie, just remember ""The Message""",1264032000,5,1293,4.320987654320987
2567953,5,B000FIKFRK,"This movie is a much purchase. This movie talks about issues that are tabu in our communities among blacks and Arabs such as interacial relationships.  The movie should be watched in our homes in order to bring dialog to the things that are never thought of or mentioned, but does occur and is often wondered.",1245283200,,309,4.618181818181818
2567954,5,B000FIKFRK,I really like how this movie touches issues on interracial couples and dating outside your religion,1233100800,2,99,5.25
2567955,4,B000FIKFRK,"I think this is an excellent movie. I love to see movies were racism is addressed. I think this movie is well worth the buy. And for Mr Mingo that says ""Crash"" was unworthy of an Oscar. I'm sorry to say that he must live in a fantasy world or you must not be a man of color because racism is not subtle.  I am a black woman who has also traveled to other countries and I must say that I experienced racism overseas but not like I experience it here just about everyday. I would say overall they did a good job w/ this movie",1186617600,21,523,3.9339622641509435
2567956,1,B000FIKFRK,"I love works that address tensions between groups of color.  I also love seeing actors of color get experience and additions to their resumes.  But those lofty concerns do not mitigate all the bad acting and lack of a plot here.

This film takes place in Michigan and I'm almost sure that's the only place where both Blacks and Arabs live in large numbers.  This is far from a universal theme to which many can relate.  ""Romeo Must Die"" was better than this because there are several American cities that have large numbers of Blacks and Asians.  It's funny that tensions with Blacks are often how other groups of color get film exposure.  This was true of Indians via ""Mississippi Masala"" and now this film establishes that trend for Arab Americans.

Like the Oscar-unworthy ""Crash,"" this film is unrealistic in the way it slaps race over your head.  Four decades after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, racism is subtle and difficult to pin down, Michael Richards' outburst aside.  This film showed at least five instances of one person facing another person who doesn't support their interracial coupling.  Not once does any character say, ""Well, at least they're both of color.""  If tensions are so high between Blacks and Arabs in Michigan, why was almost every person in this dating outside their race?  Why did the Arabs wear hip-hop clothing and use Black vernacular?  Why were no Blacks who practice Islam brought up?  No one ever mentions Malcolm X or Louis Farrakhan, two highly respected Islamic African Americans.

Arabs are shown here as being diverse.  It was emphasized that some are Muslim, but some are Christian.  I learned that Chaldean is pronounced with a hard K sound and not like the ""ch"" sound in Che Guevara.  The film begins with a racialized history of Detroit that was very informative.  But some things were stupid and intended for the ignorant.  For example, a Black woman says to her Arab boyfriend, ""This is a pretty church."" and he responds, ""It's called a mosque.""  Hello!  Any person in Michigan, with its large Muslim population, would know that.  Later she says, ""You mean not all Arabs are Lebanese?""  Duh!  Most Americans, and I'm talking of my own people here, couldn't find Lebanon on a map.  It's not like she said, ""You mean all Arabs aren't from Saudi Arabia?"" or something less ludicrous.

In the press, Detroit is usually portrayed as very post-industrial and rapidly in decline, but this film portrays it as clean and happening.  I hated seeing Tiny Lister play a sell-out.  Keith Sweat hasn't aged as terribly as M.C. Hammer, but he's a long way from his ""New Jack City"" cameo appearance.

There are a few things I'll give to this movie.  I thought it was on point when it showed males of color opining that they could date interracially, but not their sisters.  Others said, ""It's okay to do that, so long as it isn't one of my family members.""  There is also an emphasis on, ""Be civil to them, but don't take them home!""  These are all dynamics that are common in the US, for those who are honest enough to admit it.",1164499200,10,3060,4.68796992481203

Every stereotype in the dictionary is in full force! These so called 'actors' needed a paycheck! Just because the message is about racism doesn't make the movie itself, a good one.

2567977,4,B000FIKFRK,"I enjoyed this movie, because it covered two issues, interracial relationships and religion.  You can't help who you full in love with and you should not be afraid to date outside your religion or your race because other people don't agree with it.

The world is changing however it still remains the same.",1338940800,,306,4.754716981132075
2567978,5,B000FIKFRK,"This movie captures the nuances of racial issues from all sides. It also shows how love can conquer all. This movie is not for racists.
However if you have an open mind and are open to differences in ethnic culture then this is the movie for you. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it's writer and producer did an outstanding job. Happy viewing!",1335398400,,338,4.467741935483871
2567979,4,B000FIKFRK,This movie is a must see.  I esp enjoyed the film because it touched on many facet's of inter-racial friendships and dating.

2567980,1,B000FIKFRK,"Cringe-worthy acting and a vapid script.  Over-the-top racialized stereotypes and unrealistic dialogue. (Sidenote: When is the last time you heard a black guy/girl say that they couldn't date another girl/guy because s/he is ""Chaldean?""  And then proceeding to break down the cultural differences between the Chaldeans and Lebanese.  HUH?!?!?!  Where they do that at?  This movie is trying too hard and failing!  ::eye roll::

You will be sorely disappointed if you waste even a minute of your time on this sorry excuse of a movie.  Don't be tempted one second by this so-called forbidden fruit...",1319846400,4,597,5.2105263157894735
2567981,1,B000FIKFRK,"The movie was horrible plain and simple.  If you need to know why, others have posted the many reasons.  I think the reviews that were positive were from the people who either directed or acted in it themselves.

The only good thing about this movie was the girl who played the role of Crystal (she's ubber hot), but it's almost as if she doesnt exist, I can't find her name on any of the movie credits.  Anyone know what her name is?",1318291200,,434,4.2560975609756095
2567982,1,B000FIKFRK,"This movie had horrible acting, no depth and clung to sterotypes like a baby clings to a bottle. All in all the movie was very cringeworthy...Definitely no bueno!",1307491200,2,162,4.821428571428571
2567983,3,B000FIKFRK,"I have never heard of this film until I saw it on TVOne last night!  I figured I'd watch it just to see what it was about.  I hear that MI has the largest number od Arabic speakers (probably mainly Lebanese and because Canada is not far away) and of course that would make this story unique to the Detroit area and not so much for the reast of the country.

Every time I see one of these ""others don't want to mess with blacks;let's figure out why"" films, I always laugh first and then I look at the casting!  In Mississippi Masalsa, they made sure they casted African-Americans darker than the chosen Indians.  In Bend it Like Beckham, they did the same thing...  I notice that when it comes to other ""people of color"" and their quest to win favor with whites, they make sure that they try to show a clear disctinction even when the lines can become blurred, as in the case of Indians vs. Africans.

In this film, at least there are a few varieties (skin tones) of blacks, buuut there only seems to be two varieties of Arabic speakers - yellow/Asiatic and white-styled!  This is what makes it appear as if the two groups are further apart on the race scale than they actually are!  In this film, we saw no black Muslims - Nation of Islam and orthodox.  We saw no 'black' arab or a ""darker"" arab.  All we saw were people who looked alike, but anyone familiar with arabs knows that they range from jet-black to European white!  Given that, how could they just use the Lebanese/Syrian types?  Those types are more European in mixture than most others arabs groups, save from Tunisians and northern Algerians.

I just hate casting likes this.  It is like making a movie about black/Puerto-Rican tensions when PR's are just light-skinned blacks!  This adds up to the usual hot topic of interracial dating.  I think a better place for this question would have been to take this movie and film it in an arab country!  The results could have been the same!  So you have the usual people from opposite groups who want each other and their groups oppose it.  On the Arab side, the darker female seem to oppose integration with black more than the lighter ones.  Always happens in real life even with hispanics.  They are already dark enough and they want to lighten up instead of darken up!

So, they go back and forth with two people from each group dating.  They show the arabs terrorizing the blacks and calling them the ""N"" and the ""A"" word.  The ""N"" word is, you know, and the ""A"" word means salve in Arabic.  It is similar to being called the ""N"" word.  They also go into the arabs owning all of the package stores and how the blacks want the drinks so badly that they do not care how much they are insulted.  All in all, this was pro-Arab propaganda that only has an affect on those who live in MI.

In the end, I did not feel good about the arabs nor the blacks.  I am sure that there are arab groups who want to stay away from blacks but given the history or arabs, I always ask can they really NOT mix with blacks?  I mean, that is in their system as much as a native-American is in a Mexican!  Instead of doing films about why others won't date blacks, they should do one about why others do not have a problem dating whites!  Or better yet, how whites don't have much of a problem dating blacks but others do?  Now THAT is something to think about!",1306886400,9,3351,4.334405144694534
