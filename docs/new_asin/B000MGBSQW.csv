8168657,1,B000MGBSQW,"This is the worst cued workout I have ever been challenged by.  She does not tell you what is coming up, or what lead, far enough in advance to be able to do it.  She does not tell you what to do with your arms.  And, I haven't even got past the first 10 minutes.  The tutorial was so bad, I stopped the dvd and did something else.",1470960000,,331,3.823529411764706
8168658,3,B000MGBSQW,"I think this will be a much better DVD once I can go through it a number of times and study the footwork (and I am not a ""step"" beginner and took dance many years). It's on the seriously complicated side of step workouts and you won't get it maybe until the 6-10th time through. That's frustrating, in my opinion. Again, I think it will be a good workout once you've learned it, but for now I can't count myself in that number!",1363478400,2,427,4.156626506024097
8168659,5,B000MGBSQW,"I had never heard of this instructor and I tend to stick to my favorites.  I bought this one used and am so glad I did.  The instructor on this DVD is great!  I teach step myself, and I found this routine  to be very interestng.
After the 7 minute warm-up, the instructor and two students (one modifier) complete 3 jumbo routines.  Most ""sets"" are broken into 32 count groups.  This instructor combines  two, 32-count groups to make one jumbo set.  I really enjoyed it.
If you can remember the initial routine, before the add-ons are introduced, I would say an advanced beginner would be able to complete this with not too much difficulty.  That being said, I enjoy a challenge and if I can complete a Step DVD the first time through with no mistakes, I would probably put it on the back burner.  I had to use my head with this one, so I'll keep it in the rotation.",1362355200,,865,4.316770186335404
8168660,5,B000MGBSQW,"I really like this workout. Carole is easy to follow and she is very likable. I would not suggest this workout for beginners, but if you have some experience with stepping you will find this a good, fun workout! I'm hoping for more to come by Carole.",1189123200,5,250,4.340425531914893
8168661,5,B000MGBSQW,"This workout is so much fun.  It is about 50 minutes long, and I would say is made for intermediate to advanced exercisers.  The instructor is very likeable, and her routine is a lot of fun!",1181174400,8,190,4.25
