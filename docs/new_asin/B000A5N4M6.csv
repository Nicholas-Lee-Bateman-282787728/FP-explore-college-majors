8379708,2,B000A5N4M6,"I recently purchased this dvd.  I was thinking about going to either Mallorca or the Canary Islands next year.  This dvd was informative but it is very outdated.  It says 2000, but the film was done back in the 1980's.  The sound quality is not very good and it looks like they transferred the film from a vhs tape.  I kept the dvd just because there is some good information, and it does cover the different Canary Islands.",1250208000,,424,4.384615384615385
