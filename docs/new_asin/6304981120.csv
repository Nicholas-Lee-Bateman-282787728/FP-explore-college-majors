At least I didn't pay a lot for it at [...].  Most of the information is antiquated and I didn't learn a whole lot.",1317859200,,262,4.098039215686274
7880138,5,6304981120,"These are fantastic glimpses into the past.  They show the better parts of cities and countries as they were at the times they were filmed - 30's-50's.  I remember a couple from the movies when I was a kid, but most I have seen on TV since the 1950's. Fitzpatrick is an entertaining guide and the films are well-done.  A cynic would say they are idealistic, but I like seeing cities, towns, countryside, etc. in positive lights.  I see enough of prisons and ghettos on reality shows.",1312848000,7,483,4.517241379310345

7880140,5,6304981120,"These are the first of James Fitzpatrick's Traveltalks, many of which you see on TCM.  They are nformative yet naive, in that many were taken before World War II, completely oblivious to the cataclysm which would soon overtake their subjects.  In that respect the episodes might be regarded as time capsules.

The problem with this video is that it consists of the very first Traveltalks, from the early thirties.  The quality of most of the episodes is fair to poor, and none are in color.  Kino Video is usually meticulous with its transfers, and I suspect that they had very poor prints to work from.  Apparently, TCM has tied up distribution rights to the later, better, color Traveltalks, since these are the only ones available at retail presently.

If you can get past the poor video and sound quality and are interested in some of the obscure and remote peoples and places covered, you might find this video worth the price.  One caution:  I hate political correctness, but the racial attitudes of the times, as reflected in the patronizing comments by Fitzpatrick about the various aboriginals he films, is pretty hard to take.",1134432000,32,1136,4.844559585492228
