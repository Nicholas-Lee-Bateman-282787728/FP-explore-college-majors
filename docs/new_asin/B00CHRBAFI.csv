8581868,5,B00CHRBAFI,"I grew up watching horror movies on the weekend, with hosts like Elvira, Gilbert Gottfried and Joe Bob Briggs.  I have very fond memories of watching those hosts all through college, and when I came across ol' Denny Crane's Fright Night, I leapt at the opportunity to snatch this up.  Younger people might find this sort of thing cheesy, but if you're a kid of the 80s and 90s, Shatner's Fright Night will time machine you right back to your younger years, if you watched horror.

This DVD is awesome fun both both my husband and me. I'd love to buy Fright Night as an entire series set, if they'd produce one. This is sure to provoke a smile, both from the hosting segments and the movies, themselves.",1423699200,,702,4.46875
