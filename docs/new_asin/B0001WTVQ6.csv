CONTENTS:

CRASH OF THE MOONS-- Formerly a 3-part episode of  ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger,"" a rather dated kiddie TV show. Look for ""Hogan's Heroes' John Banner (Sgt. Schultz) in support.

THE DAY THE SKY EXPLODED-- Low budget Euro sci-fier about a meteor swarm on a collision course with Earth. The US and USSR combine nuclear strength to battle this threat to the planet's survival.

PHANTOM FROM SPACE-- An alien lands in Santa Monica, kills two men who attack him, then removes his spacesuit while being pursued by authorities, thus rendering him invisible. Directed by Billy Wilder's brother.

UNKNOWN WORLD-- A scientific expedition tunnels deep beneath Earth's surface to search out a safe haven in case of nuclear holocaust. The film's star, Victor Kilian, received no screen credit as he was put on the McCarthy era ""Hollywood Blacklist"" by the time of this picture's release.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

None are great but taken as a whole the set makes a bargain package of low budget 50's science fiction. Quality of all the films is fair and as an extra ; chapters of a Flash Gordon serial are included as well. (There is a link from imdb linking the British Sci-Fi film Thin Air to this package. It is not on it.)",1092700800,,501,4.4021739130434785
