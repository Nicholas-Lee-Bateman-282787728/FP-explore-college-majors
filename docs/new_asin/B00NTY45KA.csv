6680179,1,B00NTY45KA,"After pursuing this pair of films for nearly two years, I finally found the DVD. Sadly, in a word, it sucks. This is not entirely unexpected; Wilde's misogynist fantasy is notable only because Hedwig Lachmann and Richard Strauss pared it down into the text of one of the great operas of the 20th C. What I was not prepared for was Pacino's grandiose affection for Oscar Wilde and the sound of his own voice. The DVD contains two films, one about making the other. The Making of film showcases Pacino's ego and not much else. The actual film version of Salome is marred by Pacino's self-indulgent, bombastic portrayal of Herod. Jessica Chastain is good in her debut film, but watching it, one wishes she had had the good fortune to work with a real director, not an egocentric film star.",1432598400,,786,4.621428571428571

6680181,2,B00NTY45KA,"The film is a documentary about making the film Salome with Al Pacino starring and directing. Pacino informs us the reason he is making a film of the film/play is so he can capture how he feels about the play. Seriously? Isn't that what a director/actor supposed to do without a documentary, by letting the work speak for itself? So was this supposed to be a film about a man who can't direct and act? I thought I had caught the clue.

The production was more of a bio of Oscar Wilde then the play. The bio gets stars, the play does not. The play was performed in the grab of Wilde's time period, for better or worse, in in my case I took it as a worse. Jessica Chastain, looks more Irish, then a a relative of Herod. Again a play done as a tribute to Wilde.

I really couldn't get into what is another artsy Hollywood self gratification film. Pacino didn't impress me. Chastain didn't really dance, but rather whipped around in a frenzy losing her top.

Note: Wilde wrote ""Salome"" before going to prison. It could not have influenced his writing of the play which he did hastily and in French.

8680226,3,B00NTY45KA,"Visually appealing, especially Jessica Chastain, but director Pacino ruined it for me by instructing his actors to speak in the most unnatural, unidiomatic way possible--accenting words and using rhythms in a way no native speaker would ever do. Not as bad as the Berkoff version, which likewise distorts the language; both should go back and read Hamlet's advice to actors.",1447286400,7,374,5.25
8680227,5,B00NTY45KA,"The idea of seeing Wilde's SALOME as a play instead of an opera was an interesting idea since the opera is often performed while the play is not. Al Pacino's film is deceptive. It starts slowly, very static, as in a run-through. Then it begins to build in intensity until you're caught in the drama. Ok, I wish Pacino had sounded less like Shylock but Jessica Chastain is very good as Salome, looking like the young teenager imagined by Wilde. The extra DVD is more than just Pacino's thoughts but is also a fitting tribute to Wilde's genius.",1438992000,4,542,4.540816326530612
8680228,5,B00NTY45KA,"As I noted a few years back in my review of the Italian film: ""Call Me Salome"" - there are MANY versions of Oscar Wilde's controversial biblical drama available, but FEW that provide a straight ahead performance of the actual play as Wilde wrote it.  Prior to this Al Pacino production of ""Salome"" only the B&W DVD staging by British actor/director Stephen Berkoff provided the entire play exactly as Wilde penned it.

Pacino saw Berkoff's London stage production of ""Salome"" and gives credit to Berkoff for, initially, 'turning him onto' the play!  Subsequently, Pacino apparently developed a bit of an obsession with both the play ""Salome"" AND Oscar Wilde himself - that ultimately led to this 2 disc DVD presentation that provides both a VERY faithful adaptation of the stage play and a documentary about Pacino's efforts to mount it AND find out more about Oscar Wilde.

Personally, I'm a big fan of ""Salome"" and Wilde and I've purchased just about every version of Salome currently available to check them out.  As Salome-philes are doubtless aware - Richard Strauss wrote an operatic version of the Wilde play and there are numerous DVDs of this 'musical' rendition available. There are also some interesting 're- imagined'  takes on the play by such directors as Ken Russell (""Salome's Last Dance"") and the aforementioned ""Call Me Salome"".

Pacino's take on the subject is very similar to Berkoff's in some ways, but there are some notable differences that help to elevate this new Pacino production to the top of my personal list for 'best' version yet!

Both Berkoff and Pacino have eschewed any 'historical' staging and present the story in a minimalist fashion on a bare stage with the actors dressed in contemporary garb.  As noted, Berkoff's production was filmed in B&W (during a live presentation at a theater in Japan) - Pacino filmed in color.  The lead role of the decadent King Herod was played, respectively, by Berkoff and Pacino. In his staging, Berkoff had all of the actors move in a slow-motion aspect throughout the entire play - a 'device' that imparted an interesting dream-like quality to the production, but also tended to make the story 'drag' - the Berkoff DVD is over 2 1/2 hrs long!  Pacino keeps things moving right along and the story seems more arresting, and engaging, as a result.

Ultimately it is the casting and delivery of Wilde's script that makes the Pacino film shine.  Pacino himself is a little hammy in his interpretation of Herod, but it works.  Much is made of the 'discovery' of the ingenue actress (Jessica Chastain) who portrays Salome and I would agree that her rendition of the character is one of the best! I would say, however, that Ms Chastain's climatic 'dance of the seven veils' was not the most artfully erotic of the versions I've seen - but she does end up topless, sprawled on the ground at Herod's feet and 'gets her reward'. Overall - This was the first time I watched the play and really 'felt' it - which is a testament to Pacino's directorial vision and expertise and the talent of his ensemble.

The 2nd disk provides a sort of expanded 'making of' documentary about Pacino's quest to learn more about Oscar Wilde and mount his production of the play on stage in L.A. - while simultaneously filming it for theatrical release.
Whereas it might be argued that Pacino comes off as a bit 'full of himself' in the documentary - it must be acknowledged that the guy really has major talent!  I found the background to Wilde's life to be very informative and it provided some interesting context and analysis for the meaning and metaphor that ""Salome"" represented in his tumultuous career, and life in general.

While pretty much every version of Salome that I've watched has 'something' to recommend it - I'd say that this, most recent, recounting by Pacino and company really brings it to life!  Highly recommended!",1438041600,12,3882,4.829562594268476
8680229,5,B00NTY45KA,"Jessica Chastain's film debut in Salome is so impressive to watch. She transitions seamlessly through the dramatic stages of her character's development which occur over a single evening. This is not the simple biblical story of Herod's stepdaughter who dances for him and is told by her mother Herodias to demand the severed head of John the Baptist as reward--a girl manipulated by adults. Jessica Chastain is totally convincing in Oscar Wilde's far more fantastical and hypersexualized version of the story which had already been embroidered upon for centuries.
Wilde/Salome was most interesting for Chastain's insights into her character's motivations.",1437955200,6,656,5.57
8680230,5,B00NTY45KA,Different but very entertaining.  You are either going to love it or hate it.  I loved it,1435276800,,89,4.176470588235294
