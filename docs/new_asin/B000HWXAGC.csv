8325191,5,B000HWXAGC,"The dvd was very informative. It really opened my eyes! I had no clue for so many years that what I was doing playing craps was wrong. Now, with practice, I have the tools to become a great controlled, dice thrower and overall better craps player. Thank you so much! Jim Garcia",1393718400,,277,4.346153846153846
8325192,5,B000HWXAGC,This DVD is great. If you follow what this DVD teaches and practice practice practice you will make money. It took me about 3-4 months of practice and now I'm making anywhere from $1000 to $2000 every time I go to the casinos. People say that this doesn't work because they didn't practice enough. Remember people the key to this is practice! I can not stress this enough! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who would like to make some extra cash and have fun doing it.,1251676800,4,472,4.375
8325193,3,B000HWXAGC,"The video is ok.  Poor production value and they don't show the results of the dice throws.  You have to rely on them verbalizing what the result of the throw was.  I would have liked to see the results of the throw on camera, rather than having them call out the numbers on the dice.  The instruction on the sets is done well and there are many examples of the throw techniques of the various Golden Touchers.  If the price were significantly lower I would recommend this to all aspiring craps players, however the cost is too high for what you get in return.",1238112000,10,560,4.346153846153846
8325194,5,B000HWXAGC,I've been playing craps a while and usually losing.  I am now enthused to go to the casinos and practice my skills using Golden Touch's Dice Control system.  I think they've really perfected a system where you can increase the odds in your favor and win at the casino.  They describe everything in a step by step procedure and are fun to watch.,1178064000,11,344,4.428571428571429
