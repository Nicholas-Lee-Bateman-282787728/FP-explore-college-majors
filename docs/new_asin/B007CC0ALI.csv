8716501,4,B007CC0ALI,"Hi, I am a learning strategist/tutor as well as someone working in the health field. The techniques in the video are not new, but the fact that there is at least a video out there for health care students makes this video unique . I would recommend it to others , however I did not give 5 stars because it looks like it was filmed from a presentation and not made with a DVD editing program which would have made this video much better.

8716503,5,B007CC0ALI,"This product helped me while I was going to school for medical coding and billing.  Since I work in a hospital, there is a tremendous amount of medical terminology that we have to know. The Tune Up Your Memory program taught me how to study and memorize in a different way than I was used to.  Now that I work with doctors and nurses everyday I'm forced to keep up with the latest information so this program has been invaluable.

My only criticism is that professor Scott doesn't teach this program online as I would love to spend time working on these skills with a live person.",1355011200,,580,4.401869158878505
