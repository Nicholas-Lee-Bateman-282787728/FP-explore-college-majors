8565689,5,B00BC1UP3I,I originally watched this as part of a marathon of movies on board Korean Air during a 15 hour flight home.  This movie was powerful in a quiet understated way.  I had to buy it as soon as I could order it here in the States.,1386288000,,225,3.869565217391304
8565690,4,B00BC1UP3I,"I used to watch a lot of Hong Kong crime thrillers, but recently they to have been usurped by the South Koreans. ""Nightfall"" is the first thriller from the Island I've seen in some while and it's quite the watch.

Here's the scoop. A man (Wang) is let out of prison, after 20 years, for a murder he didn't commit. Upon release he spies on the family of the daughter who he was accused of murdering. He becomes obsessed with their new, young daughter. Dad is killed and the police are now after him again.

There's a lot to like here. You see what's happening and you have some of it figured out, but it doesn't all add up so you stick with it to fill in the blanks. You also have some good characters. The ex-prisoner, Wang, is mute so there is a degree of sympathy for him, but why is he acting so creepy? Is he planning another murder? Of who? The father? The daughter? Then there's detective Lam (Simon Yam) who is a good detective but always has a booze bottle nearby and needs a much better relationship with his daughter. All these things begin to add up but, after all was said and done, I had some pretty serious questions.

This is some good film making. The shots of Hong Kong are great. It looks like a modern, bustling metropolis. The nighttime overheads make you want to plan your next vacation. The acting, writing and all that are very professional. I also liked the way the story unfolded. The key plot elements are kept as late into the film as possible so the revelations are surprises. But doesn't, given what happens to dad fairly early on, it make the whole thing unnecessary? I guess I might need to see it again to determine this.

This is a good watch. Not the best movie you'll ever see but much better than most.",1375920000,,1738,4.338461538461538
8565691,4,B00BC1UP3I,"This was a competent production with great acting by Simon Yam and Nick Cheung. The women in this film were just adequate in their performance. The cinematography had a few great moments and images and tried hard to keep the action ""moving.""

There was a complex story which could have been unraveled better than it was; I thought this work deserved better direction and editing. It needed to go a shred faster, and a bad habit developed of dropping Afterthoughts (explanations) sloppily, where I thought they would have been  better served as action in proper sequence. I did think the plot had a couple of stunner points but they did not serve to shock or shake me. I felt that I should have teared up at the end but there was nothing to make me. The dialogue was very good.

All in all, this is a good movie. Not ""riveting,"" but the two male leads are quite electric to watch, especially the controlled power of Simon Yam. Nick Cheung has a more difficult role because he is tasked with a more complex character than Lam.

See it.",1374710400,,1033,4.508021390374331
8565692,4,B00BC1UP3I,"Director/writer Chow Hin Yeung Roy may not have a long list of films in his oeuvre just yet.  With only two films under his belt and having worked as a researcher in ""Lust, Caution"" and an assistant producer for ""Fearless"".

But all it takes is one film to capture the attention of an audience and film critics and in 2012, Roy's gritty revenge film ""Nightfall"" (daai deoi bou) did just that.

Starring Simon Yam (""Ip Man"", ""PTU"", ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"", ""Election""), Nick Cheung (""Election"", ""Breaking News"", ""Exiled""), Michael Wong (""Thunderbolt"", ""City Hunter"", ""Beast Cops""), Kay Tse and Janice Man.

The film would earn director Chow Hin Yeung Roy a ""Best New Director"" award at the Hong Kong Film Awards and also win a ""Best Sound Effects"" award at the ""Golden Horse Film Festival"", including ""Best Actor"" nominations for Nick Cheung.

VIDEO:

""Nightfall"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  One of the high points of the film is the use of a Red One camera which brings out amazing detail in the film.  From the orange tinged fight scenes at the beginning of the film, showcasing the violent actions and closeups of a character.  Outside of the opening gritty and violent fight scene, the film uses natural colors.  Natural skin tones and great closeup detail, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, the film looks great on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Unlike the Edko Asian Blu-ray release, Well Go USA Entertainment opted to use a Cantonese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 48 kHz soundtrack instead of the 7.1 lossless track.  I was a bit surprised because the highlight of the Edko Films Blu-ray release was its lossless 96 kHz 7.1 soundtrack.  But for the most part, action sequences and music are utilized through the surround channels and sound crystal clear, especially during the more action-intense sequences.  Also, included is a Dolby Digital 2.0 Cantonese soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English and Chinese.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Nightfall"" comes with the following special features:

  Making Of - (47:42) Featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the making of ""Nightfall"" and interviews with the director and cast.
  Theatrical Trailer - (:56) The theatrical trailer for ""Nightfall"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

For rookie filmmaker Chow Hin Yeung Roy, ""Nightfall"" is a pretty satisfying revenge film with twist and turns and a solid performance from both Simon Yam and Nick Cheung that is able to make the film stand out in the plethora of other Hong Kong films with a ""revenge"" theme.

While Simon Yam has been featured as a supporting actor in films of late, it's great to see him in the main lead as a detective George Lam who is dedicated to his job, yet knows that dedication has cost him his family.  It's his discovery and how he evolves throughout the film is rather fascinating.

But even more fascinating is how Nick Cheung was able to embody the character of Wong Yuen-yeung.  Watching this actor evolve from Benny Chan's 1992 film ""Hua! ying xiong"" to romantic comedies such as ""The Teacher Without Chalk"", since ""Runaway"" of 2001, he is able to tap into gritty action films such as ""Breaking News"", ""Election"" and the same can be said with his recent film ""Nightfall"".

This is probably one of the best films he has acted in that he doesn't even have to mutter one single word.  It's all about facial expressions, body movement and physicality.  And with decades in cinema, Cheung doesn't look like has aged all that much as he is able to play these physical roles with efficacy.

Let's first talk about what I liked about the film.  I liked how the film sets you up believing this film was a creepy stalker/murder film but then switches gears and then as each layer is stripped off from the main storyline, things change in a different direction and you can't help but be fascinated by the new developments of the film.  As mentioned, there are plenty of twists and turns along the way and you can't help but remain captivated and watch how the film ends.

The acting performances by Simon Yam and Nick Cheung is a major highlight of the film and there are some beautiful scenes of cinematography.

What I didn't like about the film?  Not sure if it's more unlike but more of it being too farfetched.  You have a mute convict who has not seen society in more than 20-years, coming out to reality but yet manages to garner high end spy equipment.  With what money was he able to purchase a powerful telescope, bugging device.

In one accident scene, both George and Wong take a major fall.  In reality, one would find themselves in the hospital but of course in Hong Kong action cinema, falling from several feet and landing on a tree is enough as a cushion to keep one alive and well.

And no different from previous work from Michael Wong, it's always hilarious for me to see him speak in English then to Cantonese, then to English.  This is not a distraction and for some it may be a negative but for me, you have seen Michael Wong do this in so many films, you come to expect it and want to see it.

But despite some of the farfetched ideas implemented in the film, ""Nightfall"" is still a gritty, revenge action film that is able to stand on its own two feet and separate itself from other Hong Kong films with a similar theme.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is very good but for lossless audio, Well Go USA Entertainment opted for a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 48 kHz soundtrack instead of the very well-received Edko Films 7.1 Dolby TrueHD 96 kHz soundtrack.  But still, the film does sound amazing, especially during the more action-intense sequences.

Overall, ""Nightfall"" is a riveting, revenge, action film for rookie director Chow Hin Yeung Roy.  Featuring a solid performance from both Simon Yam and Nick Cheung, the storyline from ""Nightfall"" is filled with gritty action but also many twist and turns that will keep interested from beginning to end.

8565693,5,B00BC1UP3I,"One of the best detective films in recent years due to an excellent unpredictable script that you will surprise you and perfect acting. The first few minutes has a brief brutal, realistic action like Hong Kong filmed before the censorship of the handover. At the Asain FIlm Festival in Dallas they announced a few minutes had been cut due to violence in their release in Asia so this Well GO USA release is actually a director's cut. The first scene is graphic but crucial to the set up of the main character. This film quickly builds suspense in the opening scene before the credits, is unpredictable and never lets up the tension until the twist ending which you will suprise you. Dallas screened over 30 Asian movies at the festival last year and this was my favorite. Nick Cheung appears to have transformed himself physcially for this role as a tough, extremely intelligent, mute crminal recently released from prison stalking a young female. Simon Yam does an excellant job as the veteran detective obsessed with solving cold cases who suspects Nick is involved in a murder that occurs soon after Nick's release. Watched this with my elderly father who loves mysteries but always solves the cases first them out. NIGHTFALL he did NOT solve so he really enjoyed it. Very highly recommended for all fans of Hong kong crime cinema, mysteries and suspense. You will not want this NIGHTFALL to end because it is so good.",1372032000,4,1421,4.780487804878049
