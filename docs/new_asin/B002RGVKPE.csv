8378733,1,B002RGVKPE,DVD arrived with severely damaged case.  Amazon's only solution is for me to return and get 100% credit.  I want the movie but it sucks that amazon can't give partial credit when product arrives damaged.  I even provided them pictures.  Had 2 DVD arrives like this.,1414281600,,265,4.695652173913044
8378734,5,B002RGVKPE,What fun to watch Rin Tin Tin do his stuff in this silent action flick. Never a dull moment.  Let's see a trained cat try to any of this stuff!,1391904000,,143,3.7666666666666666
8378735,5,B002RGVKPE,People who complain about these movies really don't get it.  Watch Rinty actually jump insane heights (ten or twelve feet) over a vertical wall (and sometimes into a second story window) and then carry a flaming rag in his mouth up some stairs and put it in a lighthouse beacon that's on a tall narrow table to save everyone and foil the bad guys.  When someone else has a dog doing that on Youtube post the link here.  Until then understand why this dog is still famous after almost ninety years.  Decades of other dogs played him and claimed to be his son to cash in on his ability.  This isn't the dog that started the hero dog franchise (that was Strongheart) but Rin Tin Tin made it legendary.  It's history.,1389052800,3,713,4.404580152671755
8378736,4,B002RGVKPE,"The original Rin Tin Tin was usually the best actor in most of his movies; he was robbed of an Oscar for best actor by the Screen Guild because he wasn't a human. This film is not his best, but an entertaining film never the less. He was a tireless defender of what was right, and he intimidated many actors and even bit Jack Warner, not to mention everyone else. In this film the lead actress had to be replaced when she quit because she was terrified of him. Many of his tricks and athletics are beyond the ability of most dogs.",1358294400,3,530,4.205882352941177
