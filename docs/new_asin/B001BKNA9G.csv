8283392,5,B001BKNA9G,These tapes are well thought out and well done. at the least the viewer will come away wwith a very good understanding of what is at the heart of JKD.,1389830400,,150,4.033333333333333
8283393,5,B001BKNA9G,Great set of DVD's covering basic JKD moves by the late great Jerry Poteet. Great explanations and doesn't go too fast to overwhelm.,1365984000,,132,4.782608695652174
8283394,5,B001BKNA9G,"He is a great student of hon. brucelee like guro dan inosanto.,but this dvd set do not explain jkd in its depth,but volume 5 is worth to see and practice",1353196800,,153,4.133333333333334
8283395,4,B001BKNA9G,"These DVD's are the same videos as what were on the VHS tapes and seem to be a direct recording from those tapes. The information on these DVD's are really good and you can use them as a good reference and instructional for JKD. As with any art, I still recommend going to a qualified instructor, but if you see what Sifu Poteet has done with many of his students like Octavio Quintero, Fran Joseph, Jason Scott Lee, etc. you can see what he teaches is sound. I would highly recommend these DVD's to any JKD practitioner or to anyone who doesn't have an instructor close to them to use to help get them started.",1322784000,2,611,4.321739130434783
8283396,2,B001BKNA9G,"Product was delivered as promised, no problems there.. But video quality is horrible and these dvd's froze in 3 different dvd players that work fine otherwise. In my opinion very overpriced.",1235433600,5,190,5.161290322580645
