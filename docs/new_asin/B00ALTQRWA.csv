8553388,1,B00ALTQRWA,"Maybe I just had high hopes for this Double Feature, especially given that both of the movies had their own disks, but I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product.  The moment it arrived I could not wait to pop one in and watch it.  My first try, the ""Minority Report"", did not even load.  I thought: oh well, it happens; I'll just exchange it.  Next, I tried ""War of the Worlds"", and it did play but the quality was beyond bad even for a DVD.  The video had JPEG ghosting and was kind of bleached out...  Right away, I knew that this was not the product for me and returned it for a Refund!  I love both of the movies; so, I am going to spend extra money to get them on the Blue-rays, like I was planing before I saw this Double Feature!",1470355200,,756,4.1020408163265305
