8435542,4,B004M5HJQ2,"Unlike ""How to die in Oregon"", this film is more about the process of passing the law via ballot initiative. The Governor found himself taking on this challenge after a serious medical diagnosis, one that ultimately might find him in a position where using this law might come into play for him.

As both a fan of politics and an advocate for laws dealing with End of Life issues, I enjoyed this short documentary. I do wish it had been longer with perhaps more follow up on those who used the law after it passed.",1431561600,,514,4.410526315789474
8435543,5,B004M5HJQ2,"This film documents a courageous battle made by an ailing ex-governor to pass the Death with Dignity law in Washington state in 2008 which was successful thanks in part to his efforts. The irony of his efforts is that his disease, Parkinson's, would not make him eligible for a physician's help under this act since he is not terminally ill. It also clearly demonstrated what a dedicated team he had to support Governor Gardner's efforts and many of them had moving stories and lived with legacies of a bad death. It is interesting to note that he was not the only governor to support Death with Dignity. When the law passed in Oregon in 1994 it had the support of former governor Barbara Roberts and the governor who was in office when the law passed, who is a physician. It is important that people around the country understand why this struggle is so important for people. The option of a peaceful and dignified death is vital to the completion of a full life, as Governor Gardner articulated.",1350345600,,997,4.638418079096045
