687931,5,6303504418,"""Divine Horsemen"" is the name of Maya Deren's monograph published in 1953, an account of the cosmology of Voudoun.  The title was used  by Teiji ( Maya's husband at the time of her death) and Cherel Ito in  their assembled film made from Deren's footage ( Deren by the way  was born  in Kiev in 1917 but lived in the USA from 1922 to her death in 1961).  One of her largest frustrations was her inability to edit 20.000 feet of  footage she shot in 1947, and 1949, 1954. This was primarily due to lack of  funding and support from orthodox anthropologists where she was considered  an encroacher on their revered territory. In a sense the Ito's did  editorial work for her after her death but it is important to recognize  that this is not Deren's. One does get a sense of her work with this video  and what she tried to accomplish. The voice overs and animation are all the  work of the Ito's-- Deren's own film was to use the sound she recorded in  the field in Haiti and which she released as an album ""The Voices of  Haiti"". The original footage is to be found at Anthology Film Archives  in New York. This film shows the brilliance of Deren's use of choreocinema  in filming where she tried to respect the ceremonial logic of this  beautiful religion.",935280000,74,1256,4.4104803493449785
688011,4,6303504418,"My main complaint is that this should be offered in a long version and a shorter version. Years after Deren's death, her film is finally compiled into a documentary that provides a look at Haiti and the religion of Haitian Vodou.

The footage could have been taken within the year, for as little as Haiti has changed, particularly in the rural areas. As a work of art, it is a beautiful example of cinematography. But from the perspective of a student of Haiti, I would have loved to get more information on the actual culture and religious sides of things.",1359331200,,557,4.57
688012,4,6303504418,"I first owned this on VHS, then bought a DVD copy.  My biggest complaint is that they didn't try to clean it up some before putting it on DVD.

The DVD is just under one hour long and shows Voudoun rituals from Haiti filmed at the end of the 1940's- beginning of the 1950's.  It includes rituals for several of the loa--Erzuli, Ogun, Legba, Azaka, Guede--and briefly explains about them and what the practitioners are doing in the rituals and the different between Rada and Petro loa.  It also includes possession by some of the loa, something that you don't just get to witness every day.

The last section of the DVD goes on to show dancing in a more general context, which I found the least interesting part.  Yes, you could see shadows of the same dancing during the rituals, but it almost seemed like filler material.  I would have preferred more about the religion.

As a bonus, the DVD contains a slideshow of some photos that were taken about the same time.

If you're interested in this religion, then this DVD makes a great addition to your collection--perhaps in conjunction with Maya Deren's book.",1359331200,,1109,4.61734693877551

688014,4,6303504418,"From 1947 to 1951, Maya Deren filmed a large number of Voudoun rituals in Haiti. In 2007, her heirs compiled and edited this film into the DVD we have today. Then narration was added from Deren's book of the same name. It's an utterly fascinating anthropologist's look at something which has been incorporated into many modern cultural phenomena, including jazz and subsequent music and dancing styles. Here, however, they have important religious significance.

Basically the Loa (gods) take possession of the priests and priestesses, and are referred to as ""mounting"" the person, as a rider mounts a horse. This is, by the way, the reason my late husband declared that my totem animal is the horse. He mounted me as a god.

I challenge anyone to see this film and not tap their feet or sway to the music.",1336694400,2,806,4.7913669064748206

688017,4,6303504418,"Although shorter than I had hoped, this film allows outsiders a brief and rare glimpse into Haitian Voudoun ceremonies and practices. Sadely Maya was not the person who finished and produced this film, but I think those who did, did so in a loving memory to her, and I think she would be pleased. This is a excellent follow up to reading her book, ""Divine Horsemen.""",1192060800,2,366,4.5606060606060606
688018,5,6303504418,"`Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti' is an incredible visual document chronicling authentic Haitian Voundoun practices as they've never been viewed by the public-at-large before. Filmed between '47 and '51 by the legendary cult filmmaker and author Maya Deren who was an initiate into these religious practices, her involvement made it possible for her to gain access into its most intimate circles and record songs, rituals and festivals long hidden from the eyes of the unbeliever. The documentary is extraordinary in every way and of immense educational value to anyone in the fields of; comparative religions, anthropology, ethnology, musicology or psychology. 'Divine Horsemen' covers almost every conceivable aspect of the Voundoun experience:

1- Foundational beliefs and the background from which they sprang.
2- Clear explanations of the three Voundoun cults; (Rada, Petro and Congo), their origins and the differences in their practices.
3- Voundoun cosmology, the Deities and their hierarchical positioning.
4- Discussion of the various symbols and signets used to express Voudoun concepts and the different engeries to be released the by Gods.
5- A close up and personal viewing of the rituals, festivals and songs utilized by the various cults to call upon the Deities and the process of possession.
6- Explanations of the various roles acted out by the practitioners and their societal standing.

`Divine Horsemen' is only 52 minutes in length but it packs a lot of information into its allotted time. Definitely not geared for an evening with the family, but certainly an undiscovered gem for those chosen few with an open mind and a receptive heart.

One of the essentials to any library dealing with the realm of the mystical. My Rating: -5 Stars-.",1189209600,23,1772,5.298932384341637
688019,4,6303504418,"A fan of Maya Deren's other films (At Land, Meshes of the Afternoon, etc.), I had hoped to find the same feel in this one.  These earlier films (particularly Ritual in Transfigured Time and Meditation on Violence) had a definite rhythm and a strong relationship to dance (and choreography).  Since Deren went to Haiti to study dance, among other things, I assumed that I would see an - perhaps the ultimate - expression of her homage to movement.  While the footage is good and the film stands as an excellent early (?) exercise in documentary, Deren's touch is missing, unfortunately.  Bear in mind that this film was put together posthumously by Deren's third husband Teiji Ito and his wife.  Thus, the film is somewhat collaborative, showing the benefit of Deren's eye, but not her editing.  While it is an interesting film, if you are a Deren fan then I would suggest viewing it as a collaborative film, or perhaps an Ito film, rather than a Deren film.

One more side note, if you are upset seeing animals being slaughtered, there are a few scenes (relatively close together) where chickens, a goat, and a steer are mutilated and killed.  Nothing too brutal, but still harsh enough.",1124582400,6,1187,4.7560975609756095
688020,5,6303504418,"Often in the media, especially Hollywood, Voodoo is given a bad name.  The people that conjure up these images have never experience being in another country or even do research on that particular subject.  They get their information from people who are just as ignorant as they are.
About ten years ago I saw this film at the Smithsonian and was fascinated by the culture of Haiti.  Haiti is negatively portrayed because they are connected to their African ancestry and being the first black nation to declare their independence from France, they have endured ignorance and cruelty from the outside world.  Deren, being of Russian descent, visits the country knowing the people and their religious beliefs.  The people of Haiti are connected to the spirit and nature, like their African ancestors.  Although her life was cut short, this film is a classical documentary of Caribbean history and the black diaspora.",1086480000,7,914,5.06

7851231,5,6303504418,"We are NOT now in the golden age of ethnographic film! I have watched many video resources on Vodou in preparation for teaching a class, and this older presentation is by far the best of the set. Filmed by experimental filmmaker Maya Deren and gently edited into this incarnation by her late husband, for the most part it simply lets the footage play, with various explanatory notes and passages from the eponymous book Deren wrote. It is neither judgmental nor cloying, and is reasonably accurate as far as I am able to evaluate it (I'm no expert). But this makes it head and shoulders better than the majority of the films that have been distributed more recently by NatGeo and the like. I would recommend a viewing to just about anyone, but especially someone who is just getting into Vodou and would like to see what Haitian ritual life looked like a generation ago, sans the sensationalism and dark drama of the usual presentation getting in the way,.",1399852800,,956,4.696428571428571

Rarely do we get such clear pictures and actual rites of the African-derived religions as seen here from a participant and scholarly perspective. It was also delightful and intriguing to get some portrayals of the Rara and Mardi Gras scenes as they were also blended well with the naturalness seen in the religious rites connecting all aspects of nature: human, divine, animal, earth and herbal productions, along with the celebrations of life.",1382832000,,689,5.2727272727272725
7851237,4,6303504418,"I came to this film there an introduction by another film called ""In the Mirror of Maya Deren"" (2004).  Although this previous film was well-balanced, it still contained quite a bit of information on the film you are about to purchase.

This film ""Divine Horsemen - The Living Gods of Haiti"" is a collage of videos taken over a long period of time in Haiti.  The title comes from the book of the same name.  The narrative on this film is adapted from that book.

Depending on how you look at this film it could be either too long or too short.  However there is enough information in it to make it an almost how-to documentary.

In any event you do not want to miss this documentary has it gives you a feel of what Maya Deren may have experienced.",1382313600,,747,4.292857142857143
