8365794,4,B002DQQIUA,"I went into this movie not expecting much, but it ended up being one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time! It's pretty indie- the special effects remind me of the first season of Buffy- and there are some plot holes here and there, but that's true of most horror films. And the ending is AWESOME. I laughed, I cringed, and I jumped a few times, too.

So, when it comes to a group movie night, this one's got everything you need except the popcorn.",1253836800,3,467,4.247191011235955
8365795,3,B002DQQIUA,"I think it's a fun movie that's worth the watch. A low budget flick but far better than most straight to video horror. Since I made the movie I am trying to not be biased here but I think everyone involved did a great job with what we had to work with and particularly the cast, Mike Carlisi really stood out as well as the supporting cast: William Martin, Kari Wishingrad, Jack Stahl and Lee Kahn, they all did a fantastic job. Had we more time to fix the script issues this could have been a 4-5 star movie. The DVD is packed with bonus material unlike most DVD's and is worth the purchase plus the cover has some great artwork of the book itself.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-House-The-Book-of-Samiel/dp/B002DQQIUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell House: The Book of Samiel</a>",1253577600,,830,5.2481203007518795
8365796,4,B002DQQIUA,"First off, my habit with DVDs is that I always watch the special features first. I'm a geek like that. This DVD is packed with them, including commentary, a music video, production stills, and and in-depth interview with most of the cast and crew, most notably director Jason Morris and Executive Producer Jeremia Draper. So for you special features nerds, you'll be busy with that for a while.

Then there's the movie itself. The filmmakers tell a story while moving the narrative along at a clip that will keep you watching. No lingering M. Night Shyamalan establishing shots here--this is a horror movie, dammit, not a thriller. All the blood, angst, and the inopportune bathtub scene prove that quite nicely. Special attention is paid to the fleshing out of each character, but it's not dwelled upon and tedious like in other movies in the genre.

One of the most surprising standouts about this film were the makeup effects--just scary enough without being overdone. One of the scariest scenes, for me at least, was a simple reveal shot of an unfortunate news cameraman's face, freshly possessed by an evil bastard of a demon. Kudos to that department.

The small budget afforded to the filmmakers doesn't take away from the fun of watching this movie, but what scares me (in the best possible way) just as much as the movie itself is thinking about what this crew will be able to do with a bigger budget. My DVD player, and eventually, my [...] earmarked for a movie ticket, eagerly await.",1252886400,3,1495,4.786821705426356

8365800,1,B002DQQIUA,"This movie could have been good however, by trying to make it look art-z this thing looked like something some teenagers with too much time on their hands (that time being 4:20) put together. Even the girl on girl part could not save it. Not worth your time or money!",1241308800,,267,4.36
