7445488,5,B015OVC1EM,"This such an endearing movie in many respects. I really really loved it!! I've watched it 3 times now. Josh Duhamel has such a way about him. He made the character come alive! Alright! Now, can honestly say I am absolutely moved to tears by this movie having watched it now for the 4th time. The ending when he gets caught but wants the boy to get away, yet the boy doesn't want to leave him brought me to tears, Then, again the idea that he gave him his ring that symbolized their bond together as father and son, and he won't part from the ring is another endearing idea that brought me to tears. Now, at the end when he finally makes it to his grandmothers house and gets to see that incredible picture of the man who represents everything he is not and yet everything that he is is the best heartfelt ending. The idea that he only imparted to his only son the only thing he knew which was to be a thief and yet the boy was able to impart to him values that made him want to be a better person - WoW !! Then, that picture of him holding him as a baby and the reality of who that man actually was to him brought me to a blubbering mess!! Oh, how I cried. The scenery in this movie and the choice of music is so majestic!! I think I watch it just to see the scenery (the dessert, the farm lands, the sunsets, the wide open spaces). It's picturesque!! I give this movie a tenth star rating!! I loved both Josh's in this!! I hope to see that kid in some more movies!",1446940800,3,1465,4.055172413793104

7445490,4,B015OVC1EM,"This is a bitter-sweet tale (more bitter than sweet) of a man and a boy traveling to Farmington NM. When Louis' mom (Mylinda Royer) dies, His grandparents in Farmington NM, become the guardians. He is a three days bus ride from their rural home. Stranger John Wheeler (Josh Duhamel) offers to drive the teen (Josh Wiggins). John, who is an ex-con, owes money and goes on a crime spree, mostly across Texas, dragging the boy along the way making him become a reluctant participant. John knows Louis' grandmother and has non-revealing flashbacks to their home We can only guess.

The film is a low action crime drama, mostly old school stuff. Not a bad film, but hardly memorable. 3 1/2 STARS

7445502,3,B015OVC1EM,"Lost in the Sun is one of those movies that likes to have a spoiler scene from the last ten minutes of the film at the start for no apparent reason, which makes parts of the storyline where we're supposed to wonder if someone will meet their demise, get shot, seriously injured or left behind pointless, as we know who is still in that scene that was forced upon us at the start.  I really can't fathom why film makers this is a good idea.  A book I can understand, since people pick them up, read the first few pages and make a decision if they are going to buy it or not, but in the case of a movie, you've already picked up the DVD, taken it home and put it in your player, you're already committed to viewing it.

Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas), plays John, a guy out of jail and still heavily in debt to those who protected him on the inside.  He has just attended the funeral of a woman and when speaking with the priest learns a thirteen year old boy with a lot of cash is being dropped off at a bus station for a three day journey to his grandparents' farm who will take care of him now his mother is dead.  When the priest ridiculously doesn't even wait around to make sure Louis, the kid (played by Josh Wiggins previously starring in Hellion and Max), gets on the bus,  John approaches him and says there's been a change of plan, his grandparents want him to drive him to their farm.  Obviously never having been taught a thing about stranger danger,  Louis falls for the story and gets in the car.  Josh tells him he has to stop somewhere first, snatches the boys six grand from him and goes to pay his debt.  But it isn't enough.  Josh needs more money and sees Louis as the perfect reluctant accomplice to get more, telling him he will drop him off at the farm when they've made enough money, only Louis isn't the perfect accomplice.  Louis makes mistakes and has morals too.  Will he ever arrive at his grandparent's farm?

For me I found the fact Louis doesn't really object much or try and get his six grand back when Josh takes it a bit of a stretch.  Six grand is a lot of money, especially for a thirteen year old kid.  But the part of Louis is well acted by Josh Wiggins.  Duhamel also plays an unlikable character quite well.  If only we didn't know the outcome of everything prior to the spoiler scene by that spoiler scene not existing and this would have been a much better movie.",1474329600,,2399,4.235164835164835

7445504,5,B015OVC1EM,"A high quality Blu-ray with an interesting plot although a little slow-moving in places.  The scenery is outstanding and the Blu-ray captures the details of color and texture in an excellent manner.  If you are looking for a movie with loud music, huge explosions, CGI overlays and continuous action you should look elsewhere, but if you want some thoughtful character development and excellent acting this movie is for you.",1472083200,,424,5.130434782608695
7445505,4,B015OVC1EM,"Lost in the Sun is a really good movie about a guy who is trying to stay alive after having more debts than his life can afford. John (Josh Duhamel) finally decides the only way out of the mess he created for himself is to become a robber to pay off his debts, but not without a little help. Louis (Josh Wiggins) an orphaned kid is supposed to go live with his Grandma, but gets caught up with John as John promises they can help each other out. John and Louis agree they are a good team and have a lot more in common than Louis realizes. I thought this movie was done really well and I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good old fashioned movie with a good message.

I love making a good mistake. I was in a hurry looking for a movie with Josh Duhamel in it and I knew what was kind of on the cover. I saw this one and said to myself ""Yeah that's it."" Come to find out after I started it, it was the wrong movie, but pleasantly to my surprise I found a diamond in the rough.",1471824000,,983,3.9396984924623117

7445507,5,B015OVC1EM,"Lost In the Sun is one of those *extremely* moving films, especially if you're like me and prefer films that are laidback and take place out in the country.  It's about a boy (Josh Wiggins) who loses his mother, and after the funeral he's supposed to head to his grandparents house by way of a bus, however a mysterious man (Josh Duhamel) who was at the funeral uses some fancy words to try and take in the boy.  Probably because the boy was sad and depressed given his quiet demeanor, he goes along with it.

Turns out Josh Duhamel has a troubled history of breaking the law (specifically stealing money from convenience stores).  Josh brings the boy in and tries to make him a criminal like himself.  He teaches him how to shoot guns, drive cars, hook up with the ladies and more.  He comes across like an innocent, caring likeable guy for a while which is an interesting part of his character (and there's a good reason why later).  Though most of these scenes could have been utilized with more detail instead of brief segments, the core story never loses its emotional impact on the viewer.  I was definitely attached to the story because for one thing it's an easy story to follow, but two because when it comes to Bonnie and Clyde-like stories you always want to see how they end.

Throughout the movie the two participate in a lot of robberies, find clever ways to get out of trouble when the police intervene, visit churches and more.  I guess a part of me was thinking that with so many small towns these two visit while driving or hitchhiking, it seems there'd be a likelier chance the people would recognize these two robbers since their crimes made the news.  I was thinking small town folks aren't used to seeing visitors so they'd get suspicious when someone new shows up.  Or maybe I have it backwards, and a small town typically wouldn't even be watching the news.  I don't really know.  Either way, Josh Duhamel and Josh Wiggins are able to get away without any or very little trouble time and time again since nobody can detect who they are.

Anyway Lost In the Sun has a terrific presentation.  The story is very interesting, the acting top notch, and the final 20 minutes is quite amazing for at least two reasons (you'll love the very final moment too!)  Without spoiling the ending, let's just say I can't believe the cop driver didn't see the boy running.  I mean he was *right* there behind the boy before turning!  Also I couldn't help but notice how much Josh Duhamel resembled Matt Damon throughout the film.

Perhaps the two females could have played a bigger role (a mother played by Lynn Collins and her daughter Emma Fuhrmann).  They were reserved to hooking up with Josh and John and travelling together, but it was brief.  I almost thought Lynn's character was well, not a lovely lady and could have been either a prostitute or just a bad girl who wouldn't have minded contributing to Josh Duhamel's criminal activity.  Instead Josh is a loner who doesn't really want to be with Lynn long term.  I would have liked to see a possible relationship build between Lynn and Josh, and on a smaller scale John Wiggins and Emma.  The story certainly looked like it was leading to this.  But it wasn't meant to be.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",1470009600,,3280,4.562393162393162

7445513,4,B015OVC1EM,"I am pleased to say that I enjoyed this movie. I was certain that this movie was going to be another one of those stories about a weird guy who has a messed-up kid with him and they just sort of do things and the movie has no point. This was NOT that kind of movie! It was very heartfelt and emotional and Josh Duhamel and Josh Wiggins did an excellent job in their roles. They had a natural chemistry that you can't manufacture and it came off naturally. A lot of people keep saying that they saw the ending coming, but I totally didn't! I guess it's because I was worried that the movie ending was going to be depressing or weird or unsatisfying. But the ending made me cry with a smile on my face. It's bittersweet. Without giving too much away, the ending made me think of the end scene from that wonderful movie ""Secondhand Lions"" when Haley Joel Osment's character tells his mom to do what's best for him and let him live with the uncles on the farm. That movie had a bittersweet ending (in more ways than one!) and was still heartwarming and beautiful. ""Lost In The Sun"" achieved a similar feel with it's ending and I liked it very much.
Oh, and Josh Wiggins is an amazing actor. Seriously amazing. I first saw him in his movie ""Max"" (about a war dog) and I loved the movie and his performance. He's actually the reason I watched this movie :)
side note: I could have done without the implied sex-scene...but I guess that Hollywood for you... :P",1464912000,2,1452,4.322344322344322

I can see why many have complained about this movie being too slow, I really can, but in the case of this movie....it has to be.

The story is deliberately paced with some good twists.  The music, pacing, and man/kid on the road theme reminded me a lot of Wenders' Paris, Texas.  While there is a great deal of gunplay, it is not a violent movie which is refreshing.  Throughout the film, you can see how the two main characters start to influence each other, in both good and bad ways.  While the ending is not entirely unexpected, it is nuanced enough to make you wonder who knew what when.

7445572,1,B015OVC1EM,"I'm a josh Duhamel fan,  but my main flaw with this average movie is the editor shows a perfectly good windshield after the previous scene when it blown up...what is he getting paid for? Isn't that his job...gimme a couple hundred grand...I can do better than that. ...I'm moving to cali baby...editors beware....other than that I agree with the 'perfect world ' review guy...and it pains me, bc  I really wanted josh to participate in a better movie",1447200000,,450,4.756410256410256

7445577,5,B015OVC1EM,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen, having been in these situations I can say it was so real, don't believe any of the negative reviews! The very end has one of the biggest surprises so I won't say anything, but the goodness inherent on the boy, the effect that he has on the criminal, well it just had me crying at various times, times of heart breaking sadness, times of just dad burn feel good in this movie. Years ago, having no home to go to, no family that would take me in, sometimes the only ones who would take me were real bad criminals, I mean really, really bad types, but I also saw how they were effected too, seeing that I would never steal, nor take their drugs. They cared for me like one of their  kids, two even came to totally give up selling drugs and one who stole cars, I would constantly appeal to their consciences till they made the commitment to stop. Some were wanted by the police, most had major times in prison, but in each one I found some goodness, and this is what I saw in this movie. As I walked for thirty years around this country, I brought my good Book with me, and the power within changed many.
  The music was so appropriate, you get to really care about each and every character. As one who has lived through these experiences, I can say  the acting was so accurate, that my whole being was drawn into the movie, so much so that I was emotionally drained at the end, but in a good way. I have seen the worse kind of criminals being made better by someone who genuinely cared for them. Sadly I have also lived and associated through circumstances that could not be avoided, people so evil, so devoid of empathy that no amount of goodness had an effect, but the majority were like this man, John in the movie. I loved this movie, it is so true.",1447113600,21,1805,4.208092485549133

7445588,2,B015OVC1EM,"Very slow pace, but will kill an hour an half of your time. Josh Duhamel was the reason I entertained watching this movie, but is NOT by far best he's made. The story is predictable from the very beginning, when he speaks to the boys grandparents over the phone, offering to take him home (even though the boy never knew him other than he was his mother acquaintance, per his response to the kid, when asked)  after his mom passed away and found himself with no one in small town, you can pretty much guess what end result would be.
As I mentioned very slow pace, to the point that put me to sleep while watching it. Acting was acceptable with what they had to work with. plot was simple, but with lots of holes. Go across country and rob any place when you need to stop for gas or snacks. Main character Josh is portraying, apparently is a gambler not able to ever be able to square off paying back he must have borrow at some point from loan sharks, a part of the story they just threw in there without telling you any background to it. Just like it never tells you what the mother died of, in fact you only get to meet the boys mother already in the coffin, dead within the beginning of the movie.
Reminds me much of the film with Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner ""A Perfect World"", so IF you have seen that, is pretty much a variation of it.
Only, not as good performances by comparison of course.",1447027200,,1401,4.247191011235955

8734201,5,B015OVC1EM,"Josh Wiggins was outstanding, in every way. His acting skills particularly stood out in the last scene which brought the entire movie together provoking genuine emotion from me in a way few films have. This is an Indie film so there is an uneven aspect at times, it can be slow as anyone who lives in this part of the country understands - that's the nature of living here which is captured in the film. The music compliments the pace quite well.

This film is not for everyone - it is thoughtful, thought-provoking and emotional. If you want an action-packed NYC or LA film, watch something else - like Dolph Lungren (who I like as well, but who could not act in this film if his life depended on it).",1494892800,,702,4.4

So many things went unsaid between the characters, but I was able to fill in all of the blanks because of the spectacular acting by Duhamel, Josh Wiggins, and the other characters.  So much regret that it felt like a real story.  Phenomenal message.",1488326400,,323,4.517241379310345
