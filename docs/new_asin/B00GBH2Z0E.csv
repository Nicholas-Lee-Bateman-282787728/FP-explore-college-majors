Any person can benefit, even if you are currently inactive due to balance issues or mobility issues.  If you currently have no health issues, why not develop a lifestyle that is healthy and maintain that core strength and balance.",1391299200,,328,4.839285714285714

6069872,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"My experience as a Tai Chi practitioner and instructor has shown that it is not easy to learn Tai Chi from a DVD.  However, Troyce Thome and company have created a Tai Chi DVD that is sure to redefine high quality and raise the standard for this type of learning.  The concepts and explanations are direct, simple and highly visible, due to the excellent videography and graphic design of the DVD.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who is beginning to learn Tai Chi and as a great boon to instructors who are looking for a more user friendly tool for their classes.",1386979200,9,570,4.461538461538462
6069873,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"Troyce Thome has assembled an outstanding team of professionals to assist people with all levels of abilities to help them improve their quality of life, particularly those who are aging or have suffered balance impairments.  Their step by step approach helps the viewer slowly and confidently improve their quality of life.  As a practitioner of Tai Chi for the past half dozen years, I know from my experience that this team is guiding people in a way I would want if I were just starting out and wanting to improve my well being and confidence.  Well done.",1386806400,5,559,4.742268041237113
6069874,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"This DVD is a wonderful resource for anyone who struggles with balance problems or is just in need of a low-impact exercise routine to improve their health in general. As someone who suffers from tendonitis, I have often been frustrated from trying different exercises only to end up in a world of pain the next day. Following this program, I have been able to gain strength and recuperate my joints and tendons without any injury or even discomfort. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new exercise program to use at home.",1385078400,3,549,4.729166666666667
6069875,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"I have been teaching tai chi to senior citizens for over a decade using forms that are short, easy to learn and which vary in styles.  These forms all were designed to help people with specific ailments, such as arthritis or diabetes, regain health and I love them all.  But something has been missing from my curriculum and this DVD, Tai Chi for Strength and Balance addresses that elusive factor.  Rather then approaching tai chi training from the aspect of an ailment, this program teaches us about how to gain and retain one of the most elusive skills we have and one that nearly every person who walks through the doors of my classroom complains about; issues with balance and muscle strength.

This is much more then a simple tai chi training DVD.  Included with the sections which teach the viewer how to perform the simple warm up routines as well as the form itself, are several presentations given by certified physical therapy and medical personnel in topics that address healthy postural alignment, the sensory balance system shared by all mammals and gait cycle training which is so important in fall prevention.  All of this valuable information is presented in a user friendly fashion that leaves the viewer feeling as though they really understand the material.

The tai chi form itself is derived from Traditional Sun and has been shortened to four sections that contain all the most valuable aspects of Sun Style while making the form easy and simple to learn and retain.  This DVD is a winner and I would recommend it to anyone interested in increasing their own sense of balance and health as well as instructors who work with students of any age.",1384819200,41,1667,4.7839721254355405
6069876,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"For several years physical therapists have encouraged me to work on my strength and fitness to reduce a lot of the pain I experience after hours on my feet. However, I develop excruciating shin splints and pain in my knees when I try to run. When it comes to strength training I don't always have access to weights and I don't always feel like leaving the comfort of my home. This DVD is very helpful because I can do this training at home at my own pace, without any gym equipment. It is low-impact so my knees and shins are spared. I already see improvement in my strength and flexibility. As someone who has been to see several physical therapists, I was attracted to this DVD because it features insight from professionals in the field.",1384732800,17,740,4.488888888888889
6069877,5,B00GBH2Z0E,This is a great video if you need something to help you develop or maintain your strength and balance. It is easy to follow and very useful. I like that the exercises are gentle on the joints.,1384041600,10,192,4.216216216216216

6069879,1,B00GBH2Z0E,"This is the first item bought on Amazon that I have returned.  I am glad the return process is so easy.
I sent it back.  I'm glad returns are so easy.  I am amazed at the positive reviews.  It's almost as if I was watching a different  DVD.  The background and floor are solid white, and the instructor's shoes are too.  That makes it hard to see her foot positions.  Her shoes do have black stripes, and, if it were not for that, you could not see her feet at all.  It is misleading to call the DVD Tai Chi without explaining that it is a blend.  The teacher emphasizes the importance of keeping your feet in alignment, with toes pointing forward, not out or in, but then she calls a ""helper"" to join her, and that woman, who wears solid black shoes.....easy to see.....stands with her heels together and her toes pointing at 10 am and 2 pm, which is exactly the stance the instructor had just said not to use. Very confusing.  In addition, the participants are unsmiling.  The energy level is so low they almost seem robotic at times  They surely do not seem to have any enthusiasm for their ""message.""",1425081600,7,1104,4.352941176470588
6069880,3,B00GBH2Z0E,"I was told to try Tai Chi to improve balance.  The actual demonstration of Tai Chi is good, but the DVD is poorly made.  I understand Tai Chi is very beneficial, but it is somewhat boring for me.  I like a little bit more action and prefer other kinds of exercises",1418860800,,264,4.137254901960785

6069885,3,B00GBH2Z0E,"It is harder than I anticipated.  It takes a lot of practice for me to feel comfortable doing it.  Of course, the reason I purchased it was to help with balance.  If I stay with it, I am sure it will help.",1407110400,,205,3.8333333333333335
6069886,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"This DVD is so easy to follow, the ""Warm Up"" section allow is worth the price!  It includes whole sections on the Vestibular System, Postural Therapy, the Human Gait Cycle and of course Tai Chi.  I'm using it with my Parkinson's group, Aquatic classes, Elderly that are chair bound, private clients of all abilities and myself. It is amazing how sure-footed I have become after very little practice. As a Personal Trainer on Land and Water, this DVD has become a necessity in helping the aging population that I work with on a daily bases. Thank You So Much!

6069887,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"This is an excellent demonstration of Sun style Tai Chi, easy to follow even for someone with no prior experience . Extensive additional information is also presented by a variety of therapeutic professionals pertaining to maintenance and improvement of balance and strength. Many research studies have proven the therapeutic benefits of Tai Chi for concentration, relaxation, strength, and balance.  As an internist with extensive experience in geriatric medicine, I would highly recommend this DVD.  Jerome Pierce Jr MD, Laguna Hills CA",1395532800,2,538,5.62962962962963
6069888,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"This DVD provides a rare bridge between the worlds of tai chi and physical therapy. As a tai chi instructor, I am constantly on the lookout for clear explanations about why particular tai chi movements are beneficial for balance. Most of my students had significant balance problems before taking tai chi and they generally see improvement in their balance with less fear of falling. This DVD provides the information necessary for me to explain why tai chi helps. The integration of gait and balance expertise into Troyce's teaching of the Sun style form makes it much easier for me to use as an instructor.

The DVD also provides excellent resources for additional exercises that help with gait balance and core strength.  The teaching by everyone throughout the DVD is superb. Ms. Thome is to be commended for bringing these experts together in an coherent package.

I recommend this DVD to people concerned about their balance, tai chi students and instructors, and physical therapists.",1391904000,18,990,5.061349693251533

8621966,3,B00GBH2Z0E,"I teach the Sun style form that this DVD is directed at.  Some useful basic skills that a tai chi teacher might borrow from to help teach a class but not certain someone wanting to learn a tai chi form will find it very helpful.  I'm glad I bought it and will refer to it but again, not what most people would want if they were practicing on their own.  Certainly not an instruction manual for learning the Sun style form",1489536000,,421,4.172839506172839

8621972,5,B00GBH2Z0E,"The best instructional and most comprehensive tai chi video ever! Troyce gives clear, easy to follow cues with front and back views of the form broken down into short segments. Plus bonus exercises from physical therapists and warm-up exercises - it's a complete package!

The video teaches a specific form designed for strength and balance to improve the gait cycle using Sun-style tai chi moves. It does not teach the full traditional tai chi form. Using this DVD has enhanced my regular tai chi practice, as well as improved my every day posture and walking. I highly recommend it for tai chi practitioners & instructors, physical therapists, and any one who wants to keep or improve their mobility at any age.",1432339200,2,713,4.892561983471074

I would not recommend it.",1428710400,,360,4.625
8621974,5,B00GBH2Z0E,Great DVD! Very informative. Teaches the strength and balance form with easy to follow steps. I am in the physical therapy field and I know this type of tai chi will help some of my patients greatly.
