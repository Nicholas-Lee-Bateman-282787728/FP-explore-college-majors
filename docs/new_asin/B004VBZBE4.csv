It begins at an Army Post where soldiers sing and disagree about the song. They fight. There is a new Captain Whitlock in charge of the post. The Navajo Indians are friendly. But a young woman shows her fear of Indians. Miss Whitlock cant stand this place, its cold and dirty and she resents that Indian (their best scout). Lt. Sayers is told to ban Indians from Officers Row. A dead man is found, was he killed by an Indian? There is gambling in the saloon (poker). Lt. Sayer bets $50 on his hand. His opponent has a bag of gold dust.

Was it stolen from that dead man? There is a fight! The Cavalry rides out and meets hostile Indians. They seek the murderer of that white man. Lt. Sayer tells the Captain Tom Tyler confessed to the murder. Sayer and Whitlock meet Mandito for a talk. But an Indian grabs Whitlocks watch! It is returned. The soldiers have saber practice. Some Indians visit, there is drama. A telegram tells of Mississippis succession. General Stone announces his plans to a select few. A wagon of rifles and powder has been stolen, did the Navajos do it? Lt. Sayer leads a patrol to investigate.

There is a cave under the falls, it has the rifles. General Stone orders the troops out on a mission. He reveals his plans to Captain Whitlock. If the South conquers the Territory they will gain gold and silver. After talking to his sister Captain Whitlock orders his men to return to the Fort which has been captured by hostile Indians! They attack, then cavalry troops return. Lt. Sayer has a plan to get inside. A keg of gunpowder destroys the gates, the cavalry rides in. Lt. Sayer explains the plot to Mandito. The Indian war is over, the Civil War begins in the East. Southerners leave the US Army to join the Confederacy.

This story has complications that makes it better than average. Note how they distinguish between friendly and hostile Native Americans, a cultural change. While this takes place circa 1860, the firearms seem to be post-Civil War models. The firearms sent to the Colorado Territory allowed their militia to defeat an army from Texas. The silver and gold of Colorado gave precious metal to the United States for its hard currency. War basically is a form of economic competition that depends on money and men. John Fremont, the Republican Presidential candidate in 1856, was the appointed Governor of the Colorado Territory.",1529107200,,2395,4.668246445497631

8443170,5,B004VBZBE4,"This is a non-standard review of this movie, as ""Column South"" and ""Hell Bent For Leather"", two classic Audie Murphy westerns, both with wonderful widescreen vistas are only available in the European PAL DVD standard.

Both of these movies' copyrights are owned by Universal International Pictures. I have run this company's name through my favorite search engine and discovered their email ""contact"". I have followed up with two separate email pleas for them to remaster and release both of these treasures in the USA on DVD and Blu-Ray.

Both movies are well acted, have great storylines and are in danger of being lost to future American generations unless they are finally given their due respect.

It is almost criminal the French offer these westerns, but are nowhere to be found in the country of his birth. Please join me in following my lead and email Universal International Pictures too.

If only I could purchase a remastered DVD or Blu-Ray of these westerns, I'd amend this with my observations about their quality of remastering skills and more details of each storyline.

I encourage you to follow my lead and send them an email asking they do the right thing too. Maybe they'll get the message if enough of you do the same.
