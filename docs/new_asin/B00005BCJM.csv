7937198,5,B00005BCJM,"Here we are; the end of one of the greatest animated series ever.  Its sad to see such a great series go so soon.  26 episodes worth of good stories is just too short.  This series deserved at least twice that many.  But at least it went out with a bang, unlike ReBoot.  Heres a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

22.  Divided We Stand:  The Alliance detects a signal from a mysterious planet which is determined to be a battleground.  Graveheart and Cryos are traveling together as are Jade and Femur.  The two groups crash land separately and lose contact with their fleet.  A

23.  Nor Iron Bars A Cage:  It turns out the prison planet can teleport itself.  Sternum is revealed to have been Femurs brother.  Meahwhile, Tekla and Pyrus must confront Lord Mantle, who wants to rule the Alliance.  A

24.  Death of a King:  Both factions of the prison planet prepare for their next battle.  Jade helps Sternum with the maintenance around the base while Cryos and Graveheart devise a plan to get to the teleport engines.  Meanwhile Tekla, Zera and Pyrus receive a summons from Lord Mantle. Mantle reveals to the three his intent of wiping out the Beast Planet with an all-out assault from the battle moons.  A+

25.  The Long Road Home:  The Beast has captured Planet Rock, and starts to round up the planets' population.  On the Prison Planet, the fight between the two factions continues, but Graveheart, Cryos, Jade, and Femur are reunited.  A+

26.  Ascension:  Blokk enters the World Engine and steers the planet towards the closest star.  He then contacts the Alliance and demands that Graveheart face him.  A+

An awesome end to an awesome show.  True, the ending is sort of unfinished, but its nowhere near as bad or as stupid as ReBoots ending (I loved ReBoot until My Two Bobs).  Again, I highly recommend getting these.  You will not regret it.",1388016000,,1876,4.644171779141105
7937199,5,B00005BCJM,"Wonderful characters, outstanding special effects, great plots and superb voice actors are just a few reasons to own this set of six great DVD's.

The story follows the adventures of the inhabitants of warring worlds that must come together to battle a common foe set on destroying them all. Honor, sacrifice and co-operation are regular themes of the series intermingled with deceit and deception.

Myself and my 7 year-old daughter really enjoy the action-packed episodes and the great character development. I have a state-of-the-art HD home theater set-up and these disks translate wonderfully to the big screen. The excellent sound quality is the icing on the cake.

Obviously, I give this series my highest recommendation.",1360368000,,728,5.3130434782608695
7937200,4,B00005BCJM,"I purchase all volumnes to this series.  At the time, I could find them all in one place but I took the time to find them; bid on them if I had too because my children and I enjoyed it that much. It can be enjoyed by both adults and children, which is always a plus. I will not comment on the seller; it has been too long and I honestly do not remember the purchase experience at all. I just finally did a review while doing others.",1359936000,,432,3.909090909090909
7937201,5,B00005BCJM,It was worth every penny.  I used to watch the show as a kid and I'm glad I was able to find it.  I recommend this seller to everyone because the DVD was just as the seller described.  It was in great condition and didn't take long to arrive.,1341014400,,242,3.8979591836734695
7937202,5,B00005BCJM,"The one thing I hate most about a tv series is that most of the time the show gets cancelled before you get to have closure. At least with War Planets (the original name of this series... I hate the ""new"" name) you do finally get that conclusion. Volume 4 of this DVD set is what I consider the season cliffhanger, and is among the best in the series. However this disk gives you the end of the story with all the loose ends tied up.

It's not an incredible finale. As a matter of fact it's somewhat lacking in the same thrills as volume 4 and doesn't feel like a ""big"" ending. This isn't such a big deal because the story behind it is still solid, the animation is still impressive, and the production is still polished. It might even feel like the production crew knew they were going to get cancelled soon so they incorperated a series finale with another story. No matter. Like I said before all of the loose ends do get tied up in a nice little package.

The extras are about the same as the other disks. A few factoids about the War Planets universe, some CG modelling samples of the ships and stuff. Still no commentaries or production notes. That's fine and is actually expected since this is what we have gotten from all of the other disks.

Final Conflict is recommended only for people who are following the show. If you are new to the series get Uncommon Hero and move up from there. You won't be sorry because no matter what you call it (War Planets, Shadow Raiders, whatever) this show is very creative and gives you a level of story depth not normally seen in what's considered a kid's show.",1137110400,,1606,4.346666666666667
7937203,4,B00005BCJM,"I was loving this DVD but then the very last episode wouldn't play! I couldn't believe it. So I don't know how it ended because the last episode Ascension wouldnt work. I sent my DVD back twice and it still didn't work, so unless you want the possibility of the last episode not working then I totally suggest you buy this DVD. Dont get me wrong all the episodes worked perfectly until the last one. But I do really love the videos.",1128729600,,432,4.280487804878049
7937204,5,B00005BCJM,"Though I will readily admit that this isn't Mainframe's best series (That honour goes to Reboot) Shadow Raiders did shape up to become very strong.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that these last five episodes were the best of the series.
The last five eps involve Graveheart, Cryos, Jade and Femur getting stuck on a long lost world from their system known as the Prison Planet.  They're absence leaves a power vacuum in the alliance, and who better to fill that vacuum than King Mantel?  Much chaos ensues and it takes all of the final five episodes to resolve the various conflicts.
SR, like other good series, shows that people are mortal.  I won't say who ends up dead, but it's fairly shocking none-the-less.
And there are a couple of new characters in the mix, including the extremely cool Sternum.
All in all, an excellent conclusion to the series.  We can only hope that more episodes get made, though that seems doubtful.",1006214400,,936,4.580838323353293
