6479056,3,B00LBHODDG,"Please note: The rating is only impacted by the design of the DVD Packaging, not the quality of the show.

I purchased this from a collector's standpoint. I'm in hopes that I will be able to find all of the seasons with similar cases. *****PLEASE BE AWARE***** The image you see represents a DVD case. The case itself is not leathery as it appears. It's a standard DVD case. I thought I'd be getting a nice packaged, well thought out DVD to add some spark to my entertainment collection, but I was deceived.

It's alright though as the show is still amazing.
Going back and watching episodes now compared to my childhood, I realize just how ""ahead of it's time"" the production was. There are some cheesy moments, well... a lot of them, but there are some special effects in this show that surpass what is being done with modern technology.

It's amazing to see how creative things can be when you're on a limited budget. I think that's what keeps this raw, and true to the story telling.
All in all there are still a few episodes that will creep you out.

This is a great item to use when prepping for the mood of halloween, or JUST ALL YEAR LONG!
You can't go wrong with the shows from the 90's.

Good times.
Good morals.
Excellent story telling.

MUST BUY for entertainment!

Thanks,

6479064,3,B00LBHODDG,"I'm pleased to be able to rewatch one of my favorite shows from my childhood, but I think Nickelodeon really could have done more in these releases. For one, they are DVD-R's, not true DVD's (some media players may not play DVD-R's). This is just a way for Nick to maximize profits, but devalues Nick's adult fan base.

The media quality is pretty much as basic as it gets. The menu screen is bare bones-- there isn't even any music in the background. There are no bonus extras, commentary, etc. And why haven't they made the 6th and 7th seasons? Again, I'm happy to see the show and now be able to watch it whenever I please, but these DVD's could have been so much better.",1499644800,,674,4.349206349206349
6479065,4,B00LBHODDG,"We like the season cases, how they look like old books. And the bank lets you know what episodes are on disc 1 and disc 2.

Off of disc one we liked The tale of locker 22
The tale of the Frozen ghost, The tale of the Hatching and The tale of the dream machine. We didn't care for The tale of the final wish, The tale of the Midnight Madness, The tale of the Thirteenth Floor.

Disc 2, we like The tale of the magician's assistant, The tale of old man Corcoran, The tale of the full moon, The tale of the whispering walls and The tale of the shiny Red Bicycle.

The tale of the dark dragon is just okay. This season would be even better if we didn't have a problem on The tale of the full moon which skips a couple times in the beginning. Regardless we all love the Are You Afraid of the Dark series and we still have more to add to our collection.",1497744000,,847,3.9415204678362574

In an age where kids are fully aware of Goosebumps, but have no idea of the greatness that was once Are You Afraid of the Dark, I find it's my job to help them find there are other age appropriate scary/fun tales to discover.

The only issue we had is one of the episodes has two brief moments where the volume completely cuts off. It's quick enough you only miss a word, but I checked the disk and there wasn't a scratch, so I know it has to be the way they were recorded.

6479106,5,B00LBHODDG,"Season two ushers in bigger scares and even bigger stars with creepy episodes featuring comedian Bobcat Goldthwait and Melissa Joan Hart (Clarissa Explains It All and Melissa and Joey). There are a few differences to note with this season. For starters, the Midnight Society has been reduced to six members after the unexplained departure of Eric. Second thing to point out is the overall improvement of the show's quality. Season 2 is my favorite season and below I have listed my favorite episodes and my not so favorite episodes of this season.

MY 3 FAVORITE EPISODES
1. The Tale of the Midnight Madness - Nosferatu comes out of the big screen and into a movie theater to stalk a couple of teenagers and their boss. By far one of the best episodes of the series and super scary.
2. The Tale of the Frozen Ghost - Melissa Joan Hart - need I say more?
3. The Tale of Old Man Corcoran - this episode honestly gave me nightmares. Who would have thought a game of hide and seek could be so creepy ... or deadly?

MY 3 LEAST FAVORITE EPISODES
1. The Tale of the Thirteenth Floor - The only thing scary about this episode is the reveal at the end which will forever be etched in my brain. Otherwise, this story was much too bright and colorful to be creepy.
2. The Tale of the Final Wish - OMG! The acting in this episode was atrocious. In fact, at one point, Bobcat Goldthwait aka the Sandman, seems to be reading off of cue cards. This is simply not good. Not at all. Especially to be a season opener.
3. The Tale of the Whispering Walls - a snooze fest. Two kids and their babysitter get inexplicably lost on their way home from an amusement park and end up at an abandoned home where people are trapped in the walls? Eh - again, not one of the better episodes.",1442880000,,1761,4.349544072948328
6479107,5,B00LBHODDG,Grew up watching this show and it still holds up extremely well.  If you're looking for fun family horror or just picking it up for nostalgia it's well worth the price.,1441584000,,168,4.419354838709677
6479108,5,B00LBHODDG,ULTRA KRISTEN,1436572800,,13,6.0
6479109,4,B00LBHODDG,"Being a longtime AYAOTD fan and having a degree in Film as well as experience with Graphic Deign, I can give you as honest of a review as you can expect without any surges of nostalgia interfering with the facts.

Note: I am providing variations of this review for all season DVD sets of this show.

To Start, the package design is appropriate as it is elegant - The aged book covers elegantly reflects the tone of the show, which involves a group of kids telling stories around a campfire once a week. I also like how the actual logo is used on the box art, rather than some other font - it's FAR better than the volume sets and the Candian Season Sets from the 2000s. Furthermore, it's a nice touch to have the discs printed with fine-quality ink with the cover image, so the phyisical product looks and feels quality.

In regards to the DVD content, all the episodes are here, according to production order (not airing order). The DVD menu features the show logo atop some worn textured paper to continue the book theme. To my dismay, the DVD menu design and navigation are bare bones. Maybe my childhood memories are too precious amidst the year 2015 where everything has flashy graphics and face-melting audio quality, but at the very least, a feathered looping video clip of a campfire crackling with some animated text in the font of an old, written book would've done the presentation justice. That's not too much to ask for, right? Please consider it for Seasons 6&7 Amazon ;)

Okay, menus and covers aside, let's get to the actual content. This show is excellent. It has a kind of relateable charm mixed with spooky goodness that still feels resh and enjoyable 20+ years later without being overly campy or gross like ""Goosebumps"" or ""Eerie Indiana"" of the same era. Whether you're reliving the memories of your youth or seeing this for the first time through word-of-mouth, you'll experience some of the magic that made nearly every 90s Nickelodeon show so great. These tales range from the strange to scary, with the occasional fairytale or love story thrown in the mix.

Personal favorites of this Season:
-The Tale of The Final Wish (Because Bobcat Goldthwait and his unique voice)
-The Tale of The Magician's Assistant (Shandu's timeless rules of magic can be applied to everyday life)
-The Tale of the Frozen Ghost (Features a cameo from another Nick show that was popular at the time)
-The Tale of The Whispering Walls (all kinds of weird and creepy, plus Betty Ann's entrance is icing on the cake of creepiness)
-The Tale of the Dark Dragon (the best of the bunch because of how REAL it feels to be struggling with self-image and accepting yourself as you are with all your flaws - seriously, it's a tearjerker).

Though it would've been nice to have some commentaries from the Midnight Society Members or some behind-the-scenes footage to truly make it feel like a propper DVD Release, I am stil very grateful that the content was treated with respect for the fans.

If you love campfire stories, or if you simply cannot get enough of the 90s Nickelodeon Nostalgia, get it. Seriously, it's only $14.",1436140800,13,3118,4.689213893967093
6479110,5,B00LBHODDG,"What can I say? I have a very nostalgic side. I was obsessed with this show as a kid. And I love it just as much now as I did then. The second season is by far my favorite. So many classic tales, Including my favorite ""The Tale Of The Midnight Madness"" with the great Dr Vink (with a va va va) their are also many other classic tales on these two discs that are sure to bring back great memories for any 90s kid lol.

6479112,5,B00LBHODDG,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I saw the Amazon sets. Given the DVD-R description and prices, I wasn't expecting much.

Instead, the sets are nicely packaged, the menus are a little lacking compared to the older DVDs, but still well themed, and the discs themselves are okay for the most part. So they're definitely worth the as of this writing $14.99 price.

The transfer quality is about what you'd expect from a show this old, so it still looks pretty nice, and there's very few quality issues that I've noticed (about the only problem on my copy is some weird missing audio for a few seconds in the Tale of the Full Moon).

Given the prices on here for the prior sets, minor issues aside, you really can't beat these sets. I'd absolutely recommend them as a cheap affordable way to collect the original run of the show.",1434240000,,833,4.503311258278146

Also, it has this lame Nickelodeon intro or outro that is on every episode.  This could have been played when the disc was inserted rather than attached to every episode.

This is just one release that should have been a direct copy of the last release, how hard is it to copy a DVD and re-burn them?  There is no excuse that a later release shouldn't be at least on par with a previous on digital media, no excuse at all.",1413072000,,666,4.171875
