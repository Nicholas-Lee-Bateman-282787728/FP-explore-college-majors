3831391,1,B00212TYIY,"I did not care for this DVD at all....I didn't think it was necessarily ""anti-religion"", I just found it to be many people saying the same thing, again and again and again.....I can see where someone might feel it was ""anti-religion"", as the people being interviewed were not specific about naming any kind of supreme being at all, but several of the people interviewed did speak of religion and talked about the difference between religion and dogma.  It was mentioned that you need to step out of your comfort box, and entertain that there may be other things out there that you may not be seeing if you just believe what you have been taught, without being willing to entertain that there may be other ""truths"".  Someone did say that narrow religious beliefs may not be a good thing, so I guess if you believed that there was only one truth, and that was what you believed, then I can see where you may feel this DVD to be anti-religion.
I found myself questioning what made these people ""experts"".  It was stressed that these people were all ""experts"", but what made them ""experts""?  I understand that they may have had extensive studies in their particular field, but does that make you an ""expert"" about the afterlife, or just an ""expert"" in the beliefs of your field of interest?  How do they know they are right?  That's where I kept getting hung up.  Some of them said they had ""experiences""; o.k., but how do they know that their experience is the ONLY experience?  It sounded like they were saying it was, and I just don't agree.
I personally do believe this life is not the end...I do believe we have a soul or spirit or whatever you want to call it.  I do believe we are here for a reason, and that we should try to learn from our experiences, and love each other (and ourselves) unconditionally, but some of what they were talking about just did not resonate with me, and some of it seemed sort of ""out there"", such as one person saying ""everyone must have the experience of being a murderer, and of being murdered"".  Somehow, I don't think so.....
Of course, this is just my opinion, but ....
I did feel that everything they were saying I had heard before, even if some of it I don't agree with.  I didn't think there was anything ""earth shattering"" that they were sharing, but that just may be because I have read a lot and researched a lot about this subject.  I would say that if you are interested in what happens after our life here ends, and what it all means, and if you have read, studied, and viewed much about this subject, you could probably easily skip this DVD entirely.  If you are of a particular religion, and have very strong beliefs, then you may want to skip this dvd as well, as it's possible you may find it offensive. If you don't know that much about the subject, and are new to the theories that are out there concerning it, then you may find it somewhat interesting.  My personal opinion would be to look elsewhere.",1322438400,10,2955,4.458256029684601

3831393,3,B00212TYIY,"The product description suggested that this documentary would present different views and theories from very different experts. Instead, there is basically only one view point being put forth, shared by all of these experts who are more or less in agreement. I mean, it's the afterlife -- there are so many different opinions and legends to be explored. I can respect their view, but I was hoping for more variety.",1280793600,11,414,4.928571428571429

3831396,5,B00212TYIY,The Path's new video looks as interesting as the Path: Afterlife.  The Path: Beyond the Physical looks to be a great connection between the first series of the Path and to take another step into our real purpose here on Earth.  We all have some connection to what these experts are saying and need to explore what our true energy focus should be.  We should all know that energy is borrowed and while we are riding the wave we need to find the curl and ride to the end of the tunnel as smoothly as possible until the energy we have is released.  Peace to all and don't forget to wax your board!!!,1266192000,19,596,4.247787610619469
3831397,5,B00212TYIY,Do you know someone who is facing death or the death of a loved one? This documentary provides comfort and healing to the grieving.  It also provides a new way of viewing the afterlife.  I recommend this for anyone on a spiritual or healing journey.,1240444800,16,249,4.511111111111111
3831398,3,B00212TYIY,"Focusing on the phenomena of the soul's survival after death is akin to beings on the Other Side becoming immersed in ""what happens when a baby is born..."" All good and well that the soul survives death--that's a ""given"". Dr. George Ritchie, MD, author ""Return from Tomorrow"" died for nine-minutes. His near-death experience is extraordinary because he experiences the MANY DIMENSIONS, places, realms where souls gravitate to after death. The most important things I learned from my mentor George Ritchie about death is this: He likened death to ""taking off your coat,"" (the body), ""after entering a warm house...now, are you a different person, or changed because you took off your coat? NO!"" We depart this world invisible to ordinary vision. Mind, just like the soul is eternal. The body houses the soul, our consciousness in a 3D world; it dies, but the soul cannot--when we die we ""remove the coat"" the body dies; where will we find ourselves after we die? We'll move into a VASTER place of existence--and like on earth, we ""gravitate"" to others who think and believe just like us.

Realm of consciousness you move into after death, has EVERYTHING to do with your life on earth, your attitudes, your beliefs, your prejudices, your BELIEFS--and above all else LOVE...it may sound trite, but George (to whom Raymond Moody, MD dedicated ""Life After Life"" in 1975, said to me"" I experienced an instantaneous playback [in his NDE) of every thought, deed, and event of my life, up to the time of my death, in the presence of a Divine Being who LOVED EVERY UNLOVABLE THING ABOUT ME--WARTS AND ALL!...seeing this playback of everything I'd ever done, George added, I saw not only what I had done, but I saw what I 'meant to do...I saw my intentions more clearly that my DEEDS...I saw times where felt like a failure on many occasions. But I was shown that a sincere desire was to help someone--whether they accept for reject is irrelevant--JUST MEANING WELL UPLIFTED EVERYTHING!  AND ILLUMINES the whole Universe!  Three classic books for everyone who's interested in Life After Death: ""What Dreams May Come (Richard Matheson); The Boy Who Saw True (anonymous diary by an 11-year-old boy who had 2nd sight it is-by far--one of the most unique books you'll ever read; and last but not least , ""Return from Tomorrow"". For those interested in ""where we go at death,"" I also recommend ""Realms of the Living Dead,"" by Harriette Curtiss (written 1926)--she was also psychic like Edgar Cayce and wrote volumes on ""the Other Side."" WARNING--Realms of the Living Dead details the ""four lower astral realms"" in graphic detail; but the Other Side, just like on earth, there are areas of a city you want to avoid because of high crime. Dr. Curtiss explains some of the dangers in this book.  If you were taking a long road-trip you hadn't been on before, wouldn't you PREPARE for it? wouldn't you have a map?  Well, the books listed above comprises a STELLAR MAP of the Multitudinous worlds in the Afterlife--and they truly helped me understand the activities & customs of the realms WE ALL must pass through, at death. So it's important we know & understand where we are EVENTUALLY GOING....this planet we call Earth is a ""stop along the way""and no matter what it looks like--everybody is working it out--we're all headed home--don't be distracted by ""outer appearances"" and if we just try to be a little nicer, kinder, forgiving, think what your city, state, Nation can become...it's up to us and there are lots of Divine Helpers we may not see--but remember: the Higher Sacred Forces will not come uninvited---take time to reflect, meditate and...as Edgar Cayce said, ""the Earth is only an atom in the Universe of worlds!""--Robert J. Grant",1438819200,10,3727,4.85377358490566

3831410,5,B00212TYIY,"The Monroe Institute got my attention with Robert Monroe's second book, and his first and third book.  Then I found the Explorer audio history files for free at The Monroe Institute in the Resources section.  Then I finally figured out that ""TC"" on those Explorer tapes is Tom Campbell, author of My Big Toe.  Then I found his fantastic youtube videos.

Now, this documentary, of which there are quite a few thoughtful and knowledgeable people who can see a bigger picture as to who we are, why we are here, what happens after this physical body dies, is able to put people at ease and direct them to
where they can learn more, be more, more than their physical body.

I enjoyed this dvd, found it informative, and while I have already read quite a few books on life continuing, and seen dvds on this topic, I think this dvd will be an excellent choice to introduce people who are new to this subject, or worried about dying.

Then, they should go watch Tom Campbell's youtube videos, read his book My Big Toe (after reading Robert Monroe's second book Far Journeys) and see all the excellent self-growth material The Monroe Institute offers.

The Path:  Afterlife . . . for some it will be a great first step on their own journey.",1370304000,14,1231,4.538461538461538

I would recommend this to anyone who was interested in the afterlife or who were facing serious health challenges to lessen their fear of death.

3831416,2,B00212TYIY,"Just finished watching this documentary, I have always been interested in immortally out of body experiences and life after death so I was excited to watch this movie

I was extremely disappointed, besides Thomas Campbell's information there was no real valuable information, the rest of the teachers gave nothing of value or information you can think and develop with, it felt like a mediocre TV show. Nothing new or valuable
I would however  recommend this as a gift for people that are going through a grieving process it can help comfort them.",1348704000,6,547,4.934782608695652

While there is a number of dvd's out there on such topics I found this one to be much better.

8348809,5,B00212TYIY,"I call it the Inner Space Program, because we have to travel inward to reach our real universe.  Like so many others, I had a paranormal experience, which changed my mind about our existence.  Trying to explain that experience became an obsession, because I was trying to find a loved one who left the physical.  I used a lot of trial and error, and searched for authors that fit my experiences.  Later, I realized that they all had one thing in common: Training at TMI (The Monroe Institute).  I tried to find out why, and watched all the videos I could find, but still could not see the complete story that the Path 11 series conveys.  There are four videos in the following order:  Afterlife, Beyond the Physical, Evolution, and Evolution Bonus Footage.  These 4 videos explain the incredible journey of Bob Monroe, the pioneer of modern consciousness experiments and his team of explorers and experts.  To everyone who created this masterpiece, I along with many others will be eternally grateful. This is a beautiful and moving overview of a vast amount of experience, told by the authors themselves.  It is an amazing production, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  To everyone who created this production, thank you so very much.",1482105600,,1229,4.832535885167464

8348815,5,B00212TYIY,"I preface this review by making it clear that I appreciate my life and prefer to live to be at least 85 years old during my current lifetime (I use the term prefer because Im aware that the time we die may be one of the few areas over which is already predestined and yes Im aware that there are certain areas of my life that I do have control over it is just that Im not so sure if when I die is one of which I can completely control by my own human will).  My interest in afterlife media and books trace more to personal spiritual reasons and for what to keep in mind for my  bookwriting and scriptwriting aspirations on the side(which countless fulltime and part-time authors have inspired me yet I admittedly would do so under a pennane completely different from my real name). Anyhow The Path; Afterlife contains interviews from various people who have been touched by the whole idea of the afterlife in some way.  Path; The Afterlife is listed to be a Path 11 production in association with Hannahs Healing producted by April Hennal and Directed by Michael Habernig. The following is a summary of the various people featured (please know that if I skipped over anybody and/or their experiences it was harm-free intent and unintentional Im only writing what my spirit is guiding me to );
F. Holmes Skip Atwater, President of the Monroe Institute.  Willam Buhlman-Leading Expert on Out of Body Experiences and Author of Adventures Beyond the Body.  He also wrote Adventures In The Afterlife. Buhlman recounts an experience where his wife met her late father and his late mother. The wifes afterlife viewing experience gave her a glimpse of her late father and his (Buhlmans) late mother having a joyous party of some sorts.  Carol Von Kaenel Reiki Master and Lindsey Sass Spiritual Counselor Director of The Healing Center are also featured.
Jeanette Duffau RN Intuitive Healer Counselor Teacher-She admitted that she became more interested in the spirit world after her mom died. During Duffaus practice as a registered nurse she oversaw the death of a dedicated music composer. She was sharing how she got a glimpse into his spirit in the afterlife where he (the music composer)spiritually became one with the music that he composed during his most recent lifetime. There is also Brenda Jenks Space Clearing Expert and Feng Shui Consultant, Beth Netter M.D. Holistic Physician, Patty Ray Avalon Residential Facilitator of the Monroe Insititute and Paul Rademacher Executive Director of the Monroe Institute.
There is also a fact shared; According To A Gallup Poll, approximately eight million Americans claim to have had a near death experience (source listed is Bright Lights Big Mystery by James Mauro of Psychology Today). Over the Last 30 years, the U.S. has averaged 62 lightening fatalities per year (source; Storm Data A National Weather Service Publication). Lindsey Sass reports that one of the things that happened to her after she got struck by lightening was her ability to see beyond the realms of the physical world into the spirit worlds, it was as if he veil more easily lifted for he after that.
There was also mention of Raymond Moody and how he coined the near death experience term back in 1975 and an interview featuring Thomas Campbell Nuclear Physicist and author of My Big Toe. There are also healing reminders said during the documentary such as how were are much more than we appear to be externally and there was also polite emphasis on reflecting on the statement- I am more than my physical body. Robert Weissberg M.D.Integrative Medicine Physician is also featured and a fact from 2005 is featured;
In 2005 there were 2,448,017 deaths in the U.S. (source National Vital Statistics Reports CDC). That same year there were 4,140,419 births in the U.S. (source Hamilton Be, Martin JA Ventura SJ Births; Preliminary data for 2005 Health E Stats.
Last, but not least, I enjoyed this documentary because many of the people interviewed discussed positive mentions and afterlife communications with at least one of their parents. This alone meant a lot to me and made me feel better about the possibility of attempting to contact my late adoptive mother. She has appeared a few times in my dreams before with one dream where she was riding on some type of city bus with me. I forgive my late biological mother. However, one of the reasons why I spiritually feel closer to my late adoptive mother and prefer more to remember her was because she did the hard work of being there for me as a mother and adopting me despite my crazy history.  Today would have been my late adoptive mothers 63rd birthday, however my conscience is guiding me to avoid saying more out of consideration for my other family members who were also touched by her (late adoptive mother) when she was still alive.",1443052800,2,4812,4.818401937046005
