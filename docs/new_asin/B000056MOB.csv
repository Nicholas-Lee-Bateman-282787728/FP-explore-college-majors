1398642,5,B000056MOB,"In Japan, it is very rare to see the Spanish films. When the film was released in Japan, it didn't get much audience but right after the DVD was out and released for rent the popularity grew. Now the film originally titled ""La Lengua de Mariposas"" is one of the must-see for movie fans.

It is a heartwarming story of an old teacher and a young boy named Moncho set in Galicia, the autonomous region in Spain bordering Portugal in 1936 when the Spanish Civil War was about to break out. In classic English film ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" Chips emphasized the importance of learning from the past and literature, and in ""Dead Poets Society"" Mr. Keating of seizing the day out of poetry. Don Gregorio an old teacher of elementary school who is about to be retired, stressed the importance of learning from real life and nature. It seems Mr. Gregorio loves insects and butterflies and children enjoyed field study led by Mr. Gregorio.

The ending is very tragic. But director Jose Luis Cuerda tried hard to be realistic as possible.

Verdict: Excellent teacher-student relashionship movie comparable to the titles aforementioned.
Rating: 96 out of 100. Two points taken for explicit sex scene.(It could be cut short to be approved for PG-13).
Note: It is very hard to get PG-13 in North America because of the scene Moncho sees naked two adults making love.",1332633600,,1347,4.747863247863248

1935 - 36 and is charming enough and the actors more than competent, particularly Fernando Fernan-Gomez (born 1921 in Argentina and died in Madrid November 2007) who must be the grand old man of Spanish cinema. Moncho, the 7 year old star of the film is quite endearing, and for its first 80 minutes the film could almost be a Marcel Pagnol family adventure. But there are rumblings of unease of course - some real and some allegorical.  Even Moncho is tainted by the eruption of civil unrest.
The introduction to the film, which features black and white photos from the period, is very interesting,and the film itself quite charming, but to me it lacked impact.  As I say, the idyllic opening 80 minutes tended to undermine the forcefulness of the final 10 minutes - and the transformation of Moncho and his family in this interval was somewhat shocking but easily anticipated.

For English speakers:

I was recommended this movie and loved it. I am trying to learn about the Spanish Civil War and this has been beneficial in helping me better understand the varying attitudes of the Spanish people in the Second Spanish Republic prior to its fall to fascism in 1939.

The film shows a very positive side to liberal parties of Spain. The teacher Don Gregorio is in fact a socialist working to educate the youth of Spain and hoping for a truly free Spain (He lived through the Restoration of the monarchy). He is inspirational as a teacher and personal mentor to the protagonist Moncho.

Many beautiful relationships are formed throughout the movie, which is perhaps why it is so sad at the end to see the Galician village experience such hate among the people there. People lost friends and family because they either had different political and/or religious views (The Church was persecuted under the Republican government and in turn supported the fascists who defended it) or were too scared to speak out. ""Butterfly"" exemplifies life, love, and tragedy of war.

Esta pelcula me fue recomendada y me encant. Trato de aprender ms sobre la Guerra Civil y sta me ha ayudado entender bien las varias actidudes de la gente espaola de la Segunda Repblica Espaola antes de caer al fascismo en 1939.

La pelcula muestra un aspecto muy positivo del movimiento liberal de Espaa.

Como maestro, es una inspiracin y gran mentor al protagonista Moncho.

The young actor who plays Moncho proves himself a brilliant actor, but is also so completely adorable that he would have made the movie had he never even spoken.  So expressive and filled with unusual depth for a boy of his age.  The story is tender, a precious and loving friendship between a yong boy and his aging teacher; and raw, not polished to answer all the questions or to leave the audience feeling good about everything.  It demands the questions of the time.

In Spanish with English subtitles, but well done, so the subtitles don't get in the way of seeing the film.  Rated R for language, violence, and sexual content.",1263427200,2,702,4.620967741935484

The Tongue of the Butterfly occasionally feels like it's cribbed together from other films about children in wartime (Hope and Glory, Au Revoir Les Enfants, etc.) but it's well-acted and in its own way emerges as a complement to those better films; if you're interested in the Spanish Civil War or have seen those other films give it a look, but otherwise check out those two first.

There are so many themes in this movie - the warm love of a teacher for his students, the joy of a young child discovering the world, the complexity of the roles of the Catholic church, the intertwined realities of sexual relationships in a small village, the reactions of a crowd to military authority, etc.

The scenes of village life at that time are charming.  Life looked almost like Paradise for a while.  Politics happened and people suffered.

I failed to give this very touhing film five stars because I think it lacks as a work of art.  It is imbalanced.  There is so much importance given to the deep relationship of the boy and his family to the esteemed schoolteacher and then suddenly, with not enough preparation, we are subjected to the terrible cruelty of the final scene.  I kept expecting something later to tie in the two extremes---perhaps the boy in later life, showing how the schoolteacher had influenced him for the good....something, anything.  Leaving us with the tragedy unresolved was realistic, in one sense, but horribly upsetting and unsatisfying.

I use the term ""noncombatants"" loosely here because as you go through the film that everyone is a combatant in some way, shape or form when civil war is going on around you: whose business do you support, who do you elect mayor and, perhaps most strikingly, what do you allow your kids to be taught in school?  These are the questions that tear a small Spanish town apart at the seams during the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1920s.  At the heart of the movie is a painfully shy boy who is mentored by a kind and open-minded teacher.  Unfortunately, the politics of the town consipire against the two and, as the plot unfolds, the teacher and the boy must make choices that shape their futures.

This is a must see movie for anyone wanting to understand what can happen to reasonable and intelligent people when their beliefs and their families come under fire (literally).  This movie is time very well spent.",1178755200,2,1012,4.588888888888889
1398663,5,B000056MOB,"'La Lengua de las mariposas' (BUTTERFLY) is a small miracle of a film, one of those magical experiences that reminds us about the beauty of life but also about the realities of living in a world ruled by politics and adversity and how all of that affects the vulnerable child.  The Spanish title refers to the tongue of the butterfly that must trust the throat of a flower to deliver its nectar and at the same time the flower must trust the deliverer of its procreation. And there is much to be found in that brief title.

The time is 1936 in the region of Galicia in Spain when the country is on the verge of a civil war.  We meet Moncho (Manuel Lozano, an amazing child actor) who is also known as Sparrow, who lives with his tailor father and housewife mother and older brother Andrs (Alexis de los Santos) who plays the saxophone.  Moncho is to begin school and is terrified of being ridiculed because of the breathing apparatus he must carry to treat his asthma.  But to school he goes and there he is taken under the wing of the kind old teacher Don Gregorio (the brilliant Fernando Fernn Gmez) who gently introduces Moncho to the finer things in education - the observation of nature and the miracles of life.  Moncho makes friends with Roque (Tamar Novas) and together the lads discover some of the realities of life: they observe a bizarre sexual encounter which later will reveal much about Moncho's family, and they begin to learn about the political adversity that colors the lives of the conservative Catholic little community.  Andrs falls in love with a Chinese girl and therein lies another complex lesson in life.  Eventually the political life comes to a head and the entry of Franco's regime divides the people between republicanism and communism, and Moncho must face the cruelties that befall his mentor as he must side with his family.  And the effect of the loving, meaningful relationship between teacher and pupil is left for the viewer to decide.

As directed by Jos Luis Cuerda and written by Cuerda and Rafael Azcona based on stories by Galician writer and journalist Manuel Rivas, the film, while always a work of great beauty and tenderness, feels a bit fragmented at times, probably due to the fact that separate stories were combined in one film, leaving portions of some sidebars with an incomplete resolution. But the wonder of the film lies in the acting by both Fernando Fernn Gmez and Manuel Lozano who together create a memorable bond that already has become a cinematic gold standard.  The cinematography by Javier G. Salmones and the simple but note perfect musical score by Alejandro Amenbar  set standards for Spanish filmmaking.

This is a story to inform and to remind us how we as human beings are prone to follow external influences more than obeying our hearts and caring for our souls.  BUTTERFLY paints a vivid portrait of Spain on the knife of revolution and the effects such changes can make in the eyes of a child. It is a brilliant little movie.  In Spanish and Latin with English subtitles.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 07",1169337600,19,3090,4.713754646840148

1398666,5,B000056MOB,"This film is so extremely heart-warming throughout ... until the very end ... when it becomes exactly the opposite, heart-breaking. The story is completly absorbing and fascinating. The viewer is captivated and caught up in the lives of Mancho a young boy who begins school for the first time, his older brother who plays the saxophone who later finds a Chinese girl with whom he falls in love, his father a tailor, and his teacher Don Gregorio. The kind elderly teacher helps Mancho adjust in many ways by providing personalized individual attention. He helps open his mind to learning about nature and literature. Mancho has asthma and his mother worries about how this will affect her son during school. In one scene, Don Gregorio helps Mancho avert a respiratory crisis ... In gratitude for the help given to his son, Mancho's father makes a new suit for the teacher, free of charge. This innocent act will eventually be turned into something cruel and unexpected when the political climate of civil war causes the citizens to denounce each other ...

There are numerous endearing scenes between Mancho and Don Gregorio as the teacher mentors his young pupil. Mancho also learns many things about life and the world in the manner boys often learn, from friends. For example, he and his friend visit the local tavern where a male patron describes/brags to the local bartender about his physical love relationship with a local female. The two boys follow the patron to her home where they spy on their liason ... One of the funniest scenes is when the ladies dog, Tarzan tries to bite the boyfriend's naked butt as he is engaging in making love to her. The boyfriend is enraged by the dog and his constant barking and later exacts revenge in a very cruel manner ...

This film shows how fear and the threat of persecution can cause ordinairily good people to become cruel. It shows how the mob mentality takes over when one's own life is at stake. The sad fact is, it is the survival instinct which kicks in. It is something we all possess and very few people can rise above the crowd to do the moral and right thing ...

1398668,4,B000056MOB,"I thought this film was another title. I wanted a French film called LE PAPILLON, about an older gentleman who becomes a grandfather-like figure to a young girl, but I wasn't too careful and selected BUTTERFLY figuring it was an English translation of the title. When I viewed it and saw a little boy instead of a little girl, discovered that the older man was a teacher and not a grandfather, and the dialogue was in Spanish, not French, that I realized I had the wrong title. I decided to keep the title and watch it, and discovered a beautiful and moving film.

The story begins in an idyllic time and setting: Spain in the days prior to the Fascist revolution. It appears to be a simpler time and the colorful village life is not unlike the two French films MY MOTHER'S CASTLE and its companion MY FATHER'S GLORY. The story revolves around a young boy named Moncho and his first year in school. He is taught by the gentle Don Gregorio, a wise man who also knows the importance of training young minds. We also see a loving older/younger brother relationship develop between Moncho and Andrea, a budding musician who believes he is one saxophone lesson away from becoming a musical Dom Juan. He also has a close friend Rocque. Whatever the teacher cannot teach him, Moncho believes Rocque and Andrea will. We see Moncho grow under his teacher's guidance, yet as the film progresses, we know something terrible is about to happen which occurs when the tremors of the fascist revolt touch their town and the townspeople become divided based more on fear than conviction. The film is poignant largely because of the way its innocent beginning changes and has a tragic end, reminding us how strong self preservation can be, and how easily young minds can learn hate.

I've ordered LE PAPILLON and know that I'll finally see the film I wanted to see in the first place, but I'm glad I also have BUTTERFLY in my collection.

1398681,5,B000056MOB,"""Butterfly"" (""Mariposa"" in Spanish) is a Spanish film set in 1936, in the pre-stages of the Spanish Civil War.
Filmed in the standard European method (i.e., very well!), this film brings together Moncho (a young boy), his family,  his village and its politics, and an aging school teacher, who only wants to teach that everyone should live free (or ""at least one generation of Spaniards should live free!"").  It is a heartwarming and heartbreaking film about the struggles, internally and outwardly:  of trying to grow up and understand an adult world that seems bizarre at best, of wrestling with a myriad of political ""solutions"" facing the country at the time (which pitted Church against king against the fascists against the communists, thus leaving innocent Moncho completely confused.

The film quite adequately carries these themes and, alas, with no happy conclusion (it's not Hollywood, after all!). Moncho  sees this adult world come crashing down upon his own sensibilities, and being six years old, find himself unable not only to cope with it but not to be able to understand it at all, try as hard as he may. Politics wins out, at least at this time and civil liberties (certainly a stranger to Spain at that time in history) once more fall by the camino real.

""Butterfly"" makes a striking statement about the Human Condition, and how some cope, some reject, some distort, and some accept it.  Seen from the perspective of Americans who seem to take civil liberties for granted, freedom on every corner, and rights in abundance, we can only feel saddened that these citizens know not freedom's ring.  We do know, however, even though perhaps in another venue, the heartbreak of deception, of lost love, of being manipulated by false forces.
This is a powerful film that, subtitles aside (American audiences don't always ""accept"" them!), is worth the effort.",1039910400,40,1873,5.0
1398682,4,B000056MOB,"""Butterfly"" is an absorbing story about young, innocent brothers of a tailor living in Spain just before the civil war begins, and as you already may guess, it begins sweetly and ends sadly.  The focus of the film is set on the relationship  between the younger brother Moncho and his retiring old teacher.  And around them well-drawn people of a Spanish village in winter, 1936, are portrayed.
You may think historical knowledge is needed; actually, though it helps, not exactly necessary.  The film skillfully tells a  chain of episodes about a Chinese girl (with whom elder brother falls in love) or a woman who seems more attracted to her dog than to her lover.  But the most impressive scene is, as everyone would agree, the heart-rending ending.  Probably, interpretation of the scene in point would differ among viewers (listen the boy's last word; it's the key), but as to its stunning reality revealing the innate weakness of human beings, no one would disagree.  Is the friendship between the boy and the teacher really ended?  The director, I think, took the best course, leaving the answer up to us.  Mine is that it is a hopeful one.  The teacher knows, and underdstands, the kid had to do it.  I'd like to think so.
The film's script was made from Manuel Rivas's original book, collection of short stories, and the film used several stories to compose the whole story, so this process may explain a little slack development of the film.  Sometimes ""Butterfly"" suffers from a loose connection between rather irrelevant episodes, but it is saved by its wonderful photography capturing the beauty of the country.  Remember, the story is slow, but the entire film finally makes up for it.  It is sad, but not without hope.
One thing more: the film's music was composed by Alejandro Amenabar, director of ""Open Your Eyes"" (later remade as ""Vanilla Sky"") and ""The Others.""  He is responsible for the music of those two movies, too.",1010966400,46,1939,4.83030303030303
1398683,3,B000056MOB,"Shortly after Franco died (1975), Spain saw a flurry of movies, TV series and books about the Civil War.  Almost without exception, the story was told from the ""other"" side, the side of the losers.  That is quite understandable, as for 40 years they had never had the opportunity to explain in their own words how things had happened.  I thought that after 25 years of democracy, maybe the subject of the Civil War had already been examined backwards and forwards.  Therefore, I was quite surprised to encounter this very recent movie on the subject.  My take on it is that something as painful as a war between brothers must take many years to digest.
This movie tells the story of a young boy, Moncho, going to school in a small town in northwestern Spain soon before the start of the Civil War (1936).  Moncho is a very sensitive kid, and the teacher, Don Gregorio, takes him under his wing immediately.  Don Gregorio's role is played by famous actor Fernando Fernn-Gmez, who by the way is also a very talented writer.  Both he and Moncho do a superb acting job.  The story is sweet and the characters well portrayed, but the movie has some very flawed spots.  There are some gratuitous scenes that don't go anywhere.  For example, Don Gregorio throwing up outside the bar.  I immediately imagined that he was probably very sick, and maybe would die soon.  None of that happened.  I had to wonder what was then the point of showing him indisposed.  Would it be that Moncho, upon seeing his teacher like that, think that he was a drunk and lose respect?  There was no resolution, and the incident became inconsequential and stayed there.
Carmia's bizarre love triangle was rather gratuitous as well, and did not provide any insights into the main story at all, other than to show how brutal some people can be, or the dangers of alcohol.
Another very annoying scene is when Moncho and Andrs leave the village where they performed a gig and the wife of the major runs to see their cart go by.  Andrs had obviously developed a crush on her, and he played (amazingly well, after being such a sucky sax player) a solo during the concert and gave her some languid looks.  But there was never evidence that she reciprocated those feelings.  Why then does she run through the mountains to catch a last glimpse at their cart?  This scene seems to come out of nowhere.
The final scene, when the mob gathers to see who has been arrested because of their political sympathies, is great.  However, it is poorly explored.  Moncho's dad, who supported the Republic, cries when he starts to insult those that he himself used to call `friends'.  It is easy to see what hypocrisy has done to him.  But what about the boys?  Andrs is in shock when he sees one of his band mates in handcuffs.  Moncho is surprised to see his best friend's dad arrested.  The whole family gasps when they see Don Gregorio.  Yet without exception they will insult those people that were so close to them before.  What next?  It would have been excellent to explore the repercussions of those actions.  How would Moncho and Andrs feel after this episode?  That was a missed opportunity.",1009497600,4,3149,4.607913669064748
1398684,5,B000056MOB,"Butterfly is a lyrical and poetic account of how the human conflicts  of the Spanish Civil War ravaged relationships in a Spanish village .
Beautifully filmed , this is the story of a young boy and his much respected teacher ; it is a story predominantly about loss of innocence .
A must for anyone who has been moved by Cinema Paradiso or Il Postino , and for Hispanophiles of all ages everywhere !

An amazing story told through the innocent big wide eyes of the  young boy who for the first time explores the feelings we have all shared when embracing a mentor,  a  new friend and life itself. Do witness this film and you may find yourself prone to be more cynical of the human race, or just  confused like Moncho the delicate inquisitor by the meaning of it all, and weep the tears of innocence lost  during a time of extreme conflict .....

1398686,4,B000056MOB,"...I have seen so many coming of age films, especially foreign ones, that only a few stand out for me anymore as 5 star films. The movie's first half, set in 1930s Spain, is rather heart warming about a young boy and his elderly teacher.  The teacher singles the boy out for special kindness and tutoring, including giving the boy a butterfly net and their using the net to explore and understand the natural world. The teacher explains to the boy all the characteristics of a certain insect before setting it free again.

However, the Spanish Civil War creeps into the movie's second half and it divides its citizens so that they start turning on one another and urging one another's arrest to avoid the same themselves.  The story continues to follow the boy and the teacher through this growing ugliness until they themselves are enmeshed in the same conflict of citizen persecuting fellow citizen that every Civil War entails.  The boy now sees the natural world at his own level of existence, indeed comes of age, and grows up by following his own survival characteristics.

1398688,5,B000056MOB,"For most of its running time, this story of growing up in 1930s Spain envelops the audience in a cloud of gentle, lyrical nostalgia. The evocation of long-lost boyhood is realized beautifully through the exquisite photography and the fine performances, particularly that of Fernando Fernan Gomez as a kindly, dedicated teacher. But as the shadows of the Spanish Civil War creep over the story, the action gradually gets nastier, building to an ending which is as shocking as it is tearjerking. ""Butterfly,"" beautiful and bitterly poignant, reminds me of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--if Atticus, Scout and Jem had all joined the lynch mob against Tom Robinson.",983750400,7,655,5.188679245283019

7932431,5,B000056MOB,"What a lovely coming-of-age film taking place in Spain-Galacia in 1936.  The full title of this film is La lengua de las mariposas, or Tongue of the Butterflies, a more appropriate title considering the film's closure. Starring Fernando Fernn Gmez (RIP) as Don Gregorio, the elder elementary teacher who teaches his students about life and freedom, and Manuel Lozano as Moncho (a child actor who only made two films in his life), the young tailor's boy with an innocent faith in God and who is enamored by all that Don Gregorio teaches him.  Once Moncho learns that his teacher, who is a Republican like his father, does not hit his students, his mind and curiosity expand. His mother is very pious; his dad, not so much.  This is the first difference little Moncho knows when he starts school.

There is no violence in this film but there is one sex scene preceded by vulgar language, from around 21-26 minutes.  The rest of the film shows how Moncho, his classmates, and villagers live as a civil war slowly grows and comes to their part of the country.  While Don Gregorio teaches Moncho about bugs and butterflies, he also makes subtle statements about young minds finding their freedom of expression, words which don't mean much until the film ends and little Moncho becomes part of society that his teacher had warned his students about.  It is a sad but true end to what happened in Spain at this time, as families and towns were ripped apart and it became a survival of the Republicans vs the Nationalists.

Another great film that portrays the Spanish Civil War is ""Carol's Journey,"" although there are more violent scenes in that film.",1516492800,,1645,4.7272727272727275
