6447701,4,B00KU3Y2LU,DO NOT watch the trailer first. It gives it away. Can't believe they did that. It will keep you guessing if you don't watch it. Good suspenseful movie.,1410393600,3,151,4.428571428571429
6447702,1,B00KU3Y2LU,"Can't believe the reviews this movie got.  It is not very interesting or realistic.  Spoiler alert -  who has that kind of money to set up such a ruse.  Acting wasn't very good and the plot had many problems, such as being unbelievable and you can see something just doesn't fit.  Really disappointing.",1432944000,,302,4.622641509433962

6447724,4,B00KU3Y2LU,Surprised this movie wasn't given a lot of review from film critics.  Crazy plot asking the question of just how far would you go or should you go to protect a loved one.,1415836800,,170,4.151515151515151
6447725,4,B00KU3Y2LU,"I was interested in Taken for Ransom because I am a fan of Teri Polo.  I had seen Polo in dramas and romantic comedies, and wanted to see her in a thriller-type movie.  All the characters did a good job making their roles believable, and Polo did not disappoint me at all.  The plot was a bit predictable, though some mystery remained until the end when all questions were resolved.  If you like fast-paced car chases and such, this is not the movie for you -- Taken for Ransom is more of a psychological drama than an action-packed story.  I usually assign a 4-star rating to a movie that I am certain I will watch multiple times. I just received Taken for Ransom, but have already watched it three times.",1414972800,2,706,4.4

6447731,2,B00KU3Y2LU,"The film opens showing us the ideal life of soccer mom Brooke Holton  (Teri Polo). While multi-tasking while driving she meets with bad consequences that cause her to live a life of alcohol, pills, and 3 packs a day. One day Brooke is kidnapped, by fairly nice people, and held for ransom along with a young man who happens to play soccer, like her dead son. Brooke is forced to sober up, face reality and find a reason to live. The original title of the film, I can't repeat as it was a plot spoiler.

I saw the twist before she was kidnapped, which made the film painful to watch as the acting and script was not great. If you like those Lifetime type films, and aren't too bright, you might want to check this one out.

Parental Guidance: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1411862400,3,769,4.326388888888889

8661586,3,B00KU3Y2LU,"In this heart-wrenching Lifetime Original, Brooke lives an ideal, happy life. She is a wealthy businesswoman with a handsome husband and two wonderful children, but her life is torn apart when her son is killed in a car accident. Blaming herself for his death, she spirals into a dark place, developing substance abuse problems and becoming disconnected from the rest of her family that still love her.

One day, in the haze of a drunken stupor, Brooke is kidnapped and dragged to a makeshift prison in the middle of nowhere. The kidnappers stage her suicide to throw the police off the trail, and once things have settled down, quietly approach Brooke s husband for ransom money. During that time, Brooke goes through the agony of drug/alcohol withdrawal.

In her sobriety, she is forced to confront the issues from which she has been running. As the days pass, Brooke discovers that she is not going to be released and that her husband and daughter are in grave danger. Her mindset completely changed, she plans to escape from her captors and protect her family at any cost",1516838400,,1075,4.805405405405406
8661587,5,B00KU3Y2LU,"This movie was both an intriguing mystery with a splendid twist of an ending and one of the most brilliant psychotherapy interventions I've ever seen.
As a therapist I love psychological thrillers, which this is, but also like to see therapy portrayed in an unusual and original way.  The acting, direction and score were first-rate and the script was masterful.  This is not a movie for car-chase fans, but a subtle plot, the suspense of which comes out of the unusual situation of the characters, their adaptation to the unusual situation, and the ingenious ending.  The story can also be seen as an allegory, with the surface story about a kidnapping and the underlying symbolic story being about good and evil and how one is sometimes mistaken for the other.  This is a thoughtful movie that I would see again.",1490486400,,814,4.792857142857143
