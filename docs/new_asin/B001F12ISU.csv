3560340,4,B001F12ISU,"I've been walking with Leslie for nearly two years now, and this 5 mile walk is defnitely one of the best I've seen from her. The workout itself is wonderful-- no extra equipment needed, just 71 minutes of straight cardio. There is no music-only option, but I don't mind her chatter here. The music changes from mile to mile, and the time goes by fairly quickly.

The only real criticism is that odometer in the bottom corner. It keeps flipping back and forth between the current mile number, and a bunch of zeros. If it had the elapsed time, or time left in the mile, that would be different. I've learned to ignore it, but in the beginning it was kind of distracting.

All in all, I can do this DVD again and again, and if you're already a fan of Leslie's, I don't think there's any reason you wouldn't like this work out :)",1230249600,5,826,4.32258064516129
3560341,5,B001F12ISU,"I love these walk videos because they WORK!  I started with the one-mile and recently bought this one. I do 3 miles daily, and come 1/1 I will go for the 4 miles.  Eventually I will do 5 miles.  I never was one for indoor work-outs but these videos changed my mind.  I do water aerobics during the summer, and was looking for a program to take after the summer.  These videos are easy, fun and most of all effective. I am a diabetic, and since September, my blood tests have improved even more. I feel great, look better, have plenty of energy  and best of all have lost 12 more lbs.  I eat healthy (cheat sometimes)but all in all thse videos have done me wonders.  Thanks, Leslie.",1230249600,2,681,4.265625
3560342,3,B001F12ISU,"This is the 11th DVD of Leslie's ""Walk at Home"" series that my wife and I have added to and enjoyed for more than 6 years.  While it's a decent workout, it is certainly not as good as many of her others.  The odometer that continuously flashes in the lower left corner of the screen is quite annoying.",1229817600,6,301,4.172413793103448
3560343,5,B001F12ISU,"I use to have to walk 3 miles to work, and 3 miles back. Walking back was up hill all the way.  This is so  very much the workout  as walking that 6.  You  really  feel the calories melt away. You feel renewed physically and very energetic.  I have seen so many of my friends walk 3 miles a day and  loose  40-60 lbs, just by walking.  Walk is the way to  loose weight and stay in great shape. We have lost the art of walking everywhere since cars came about. My daughter and I  love this dvd.",1229817600,16,493,3.9183673469387754
3560344,5,B001F12ISU,"I am a fan of Leslie's videos but I am enjoying this one more that any of the others.  I like the ""boosted walking"" segments which shorten the time of the miles. You can knock out 3 miles in no time and you can do as many miles as you like according to the time you have to spend.  Good job Leslie!",1229731200,,298,3.7903225806451615
3560345,5,B001F12ISU,"I am a devoted customer of Leslie Sansone.  I have practically all of her videos and this one is good to have in your video library. Overall, the music is great it is modern and helps you keep up the pace. It is takes less time to complete each mile and the cool-down is longer, she incorporates yoga postures that give you an excellent stretch.  This video will add variety to your Walk at Home collection.

I am an advanced walker and was looking for a walk that covered a lot of miles in a shorter period of time, her other 5 mile walks were well over an hour and they begin to become monotonous after a while.  Though there are no new walking moves on this tape, the new five mile walk is a time saver and a better calorie burner than the others because the pace is a bit faster.  Each mile is 12-13 minutes with the last 2 minutes of ""boosted walking"" (jogging).

It's important for consumers to know that with all of Leslie Sansone's walking tapes you are not walking an actual mile.  If you are trying to lose weight, the focus now-a-days is on the number of steps one walks.  Because this video is designed for the advanced walker, I hoped that Leslie would have created actual 12 minute miles with this new video.  But her miles (Leslie Miles) are measured by the beats in the music and a real walking mile is measured by the number of steps that you take.  This is very important if you are counting calories because there is a significant difference between the calories burned at a brisk walking pace of 5 mph verses 4 mph.  It's best to use a pedometer if you are counting calories or steps.",1229385600,7,1604,4.3133333333333335
3560346,5,B001F12ISU,"I have been a Leslie Sansone fan for many years and own lots of her videos; the 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk, by far, my favorite! I would definitely say that this video (if you do the entire thing) is geared to intermediate/advanced exercisers. If you are a beginner, consider just doing a mile or two and working up towards the whole workout.

I loved the fact that the video breaks each mile down individually. The first and fifth mile have only Leslie leading. The second, third, and fourth mile include several other walkers and different music for each mile. I LOVE the music on this video more than any of the other videos. The miles are completed MUCH faster than Leslie's other videos. I also believe this 5 mile workout goes by very quickly!

EACH mile is 12-13 minutes and is roughly broken down as follows:
-Approx. 5 min of moderate walking
-Approx. 5 min of brisk/""power walking""
-2 min of ""boosted walking""

The boosted walking  is actually gentle jogging and ""boosted"" forms of kicks and knee lifts. Walkers have the option of joining Leslie with the boosted walking or just power walking. She insists that even if you are unable to do the higher impact version, lower impact is just fine.

There really is no warm-up (even in the first segment), but there is a cool down at the end of the video that lasts 6 minutes. If you do the entire video, the workout will last 68 minutes.

I would recommend this video especially to Leslie Sansone Veteran Walkers, but beginners can easily grow and advance as their fitness improves.",1228348800,509,1535,4.604395604395604
3560347,5,B001F12ISU,"If you have been walking with Leslie for a while you know that each new workout she comes out with is just as great as the one before. If you have done Leslie before and have been slacking and need something fresh to remotivate you (that is me)this one is a great motivator. If you are new to Leslie what are you waiting for?
I got this one in the mail yesterday and did 2 of the five miles last night. This morning I got up and did 3 of the 5 miles. This is a great one! Here is the breakdown. There are 5- 1 mile walks, each walk is 12 minutes. The first mile is just Leslie. Miles 2,3, and 4 have various walkers with her. The final mile is Leslie alone again. Each mile is 12 minutes and she does her boosted walking at the end, before the cool down. I personally LOVE the boosted walking! In the intro She suggests doing 1 mile before every meal. I just may have to try that! There is also a wonderful interview with one of her walkers at the end. It personally inspired me because she talks about her dad getting sick and that being her wake up call. I was recently diagnosed with type II diabetes. My father is a very uncontrolled (stubborn)diabetic who has lost one leg already and had a stroke. I am on a mission to NOT be my dad and hearing Nicole's story was just the inspiration I needed to remind myself that I can be the healthiest diabetic I can possibly be. I plan to revisit her story whenever I need some insiration to just walk, walk, walk.",1228262400,177,1459,4.12280701754386

3560361,3,B001F12ISU,"It is exactly as described, you're walking in-place.

Helps to burn a tiny amount of calories, but if you're expecting to look like Leslie using only this, you will be very very disappointed!

Great product for the elderly, or if you're very obese, and joint pain is a major concern.
Low-impact workouts are what make for a productive workout when you're obese. It's nothing to be ashamed of, our weight when not managed can easily get away from us!

Remove ALL sugar from your diet! ALL sugar, and starches, and lower your food intake, use this product to help you burn off excess calories and I promise you will come back and thank me for this review!

70% of your weight-loss is diet!

In my opinion, this is the ""easy way"" to lose weight, but with one major drawback, you will never achieve your goal with this product and changing your diet alone, but this is a good place to start!",1480204800,,887,4.484472049689441

""TYPE IN: WALK AWAY YOUR WAISTLINE"" (Greenish blue) if you are OVER 200lbs..300lbs..400lbs.

The WAISTLINE DVD is for someone 200-400 Pounds and up!!! This makes you feel like there is hope for you! I dnt care for Jane Fonda because she does exercises for skinny people that overweight people can't accomplish. I gave up until I was introduced to Leslie Sansone. I was close to 400lbs and lost 120lbs. IT WORKS!!! From a size 32 (female) to size 18/20. You can too!

I like all Leslie sansone DVD, but the BEST ONE OF ALL IS: WALK AWAY YOUR WAISTLINE. When you are OVER 400lbs or near it, it's hard to move your limbs. BUT NOT WITH ""WAISTLINE DVD.""

3560373,5,B001F12ISU,"I had this video and used it daily back in 2013. I lost about 50 lbs by eating healthy and working out to this video daily. I started out only being able to do the 1st mile and gradually got up to the entire 5 miles daily. I'm not sure where I went astray but I quit working out all together and started eating crappy again... Now I'm starting over! I've started with just the one mile and eating healthy again. Hopefully I'll lose it as quickly as I did last time since I lost it all within 5 months of being really committed. This is a great video for someone like me who has high impact restrictions. If you need more of a gentle workout that you can choose the intensity level for yourself this is the video for you. To me this is the best video Leslie has ever made. The only thing I don't like is that this video isn't available as a digital copy. It would be nice if I could have added it to our video library instead of having to actually keep up with a DVD.

3560375,3,B001F12ISU,"For walkers looking for five fast-paced miles, this one fills the bill. Plus, you can boost your walk with high impact moves. However, there's more to losing weight than burning calories. Strength-building  is equally important, because muscles burn more calories...which is why I still prefer Leslie's 5 Day Slim Down video. (I use arm weights with the ""Sculpt Your Arms"" mile and I pause the video to do extra sets of lunges and squats in the ""Slim Your Legs"" mile. Also, I prefer walking with Leslie solo, rather than with a group. (2 of the miles in this video are solo.)

I like the boosted walking, since I would get really bored with it otherwise. I also like the fact that once can choose your workout. There are 5 miles total, but they are divided into 1 mile increments.
There's a little mile marker on the side to show you how far in the mile you have gone.  The 2 minute boost at the end is great, and she of course always has the walking alternative.
It was a great thing to have when we loved in the North East with harsh winters, and not being able to get outside.  Now it's just good because with young kids in the house, free time, is not always available at a time when it's convenient to head outdoors.

3560411,5,B001F12ISU,"I recently had to take my workouts down a notch because a knee injury, and ended up reintroducing myself to Leslie Sansone's workouts. I'd done them in the past but moved on to other things. I was nervous that I wouldn't feel like I was getting a good workout, but ended up being pleasantly surprised by the intensity level. I workup a great sweat, but don't have the strain on my knee. Someone who is already in super great shape might not get as much out of the workouts, but for someone more average definitely will. I also love that it's SIMPLE. There are no dance type moves. Just simple stuff that anyone can do. I just want to workout, not learn a dance, so this is perfect for that.

This video in particular I love that you can create your own workout based on which miles you want to do that day. I've done all 5 miles a few times, and it is tough!  And I really love Leslie as an instructor and motivator. She doesn't feel fake like other instructors sometimes do.

I think whether you're a beginner walker or have done Leslie's workouts in the past, this DVD can benefit you. It's got a lot of options and different intensity levels. Highly recommend!",1445731200,8,1163,4.375

I finding myself boosting throughout the program, not just at the end.  These are pretty intense 12 minute miles with big arm movements.  Not meant for hand weights in my opinion.  The full 5 miles goes fast and I do not get bored--a problem I often have with other DVDs.",1443830400,3,411,4.139240506329114

The beginning of each mile starts out at a faster 'warm up' than her other videos. However, like some other reviewers, I don't like starting back at 'warm up' pace after doing the 2 minute boost at the end of each mile.

3560461,5,B001F12ISU,"Getting back into an exercise program after gaining weight is really hard.  I usually walk or ride my bike, but I was too heavy and embarrassed to put on active wear and go outside in public.  So, this dvd was an excellent way to get back into it again.

Each mile is a little bit harder and they let you know when you hit each half mile too.  Leslie is very motivating and upbeat, and the steps are easy to do.  Don't let ""easy to do"" fool you though.  I work out hard and really sweat.  The steps are simple to learn, but this is a really good workout.  In fact, I really feel that I work out much harder than I do when I walk outside or ride my bike.  After 4 weeks I'm up to 4 miles now and it's great.  I've lost 7 pounds also!!  I'm very happy I got this one.

The music is pretty good, but since I do this 4-5 times a week, I needed some different tunes or I'd lose my mind, a common problem with dvd's at home.  Simple solution, put on Pandora and play your favorite dance music.  It's a little off beat from the dvd, but you can still follow along easily and honestly, I think I accidentally go faster when I'm listening to my own tunes.

They also do 2 minute power boosts (higher impact but not crazy) at the end of each mile so you can always work out a little harder and push yourself if you want to, or just stay at the low impact steps.  I think this is a great dvd to grow with, from beginners to intermediates.  Advanced people?  I don't know, I would say they would be ok too, but might find it too elementary.  12 minute miles are nothing to sneeze at though, I am very proud of the fact that I've worked myself up to a 4 mile/48 minute aerobic workout.

There are sneak previews on youtube of the first mile, so if you're not familiar with Leslie, you can get a glimpse.  That's what I did before buying.",1431129600,3,1824,4.039106145251397
3560462,5,B001F12ISU,"Leslie Sansone fails to disappoint. Although sometimes the music is boring, and the constant chattering can be distracting, I just mute and continue walking. I love the fact that you can pick as many miles as you want, and it overlaps quickly.  A true fan of all her DVDs, as you get a healthy workout without injury.",1430956800,,317,4.56140350877193

3560464,5,B001F12ISU,"I love this DVD !!  I like that you can select any one walk to do.  Every walk has a two minute ""boosted walk"" (jog) in it at the end.  You can then use your dvd remote to get the cooldown and stretch after any of the walks.  These miles only take 12 minutes - so it easy to do one or two before work or in the evening.  Or do all five on a day off.  Like all of her videos, this is easy to do - no complex moves, no difficult routines.  It can be adjusted for any fitness level.  I think this is probably my favorite Sansone video so far.  I love the faster pace and the jogs.  By the end of the 12 minutes I am sweating !!",1429833600,,624,3.659090909090909
3560465,3,B001F12ISU,"I agree with reviewers who say this is boring. I usually turn the sound way down and listen to an audiobook and that helps. My bigger problem is with the mileage- I wear a Fitbit and Sansone's first two miles measures 1.55 miles on the Fitbit. Not a huge problem- the time matters more to me, but people who care about distance might want to keep track. Otherwise, absent a treadmill, decent weather, safe neighborhood, etc, this does the trick in a pinch.",1429833600,,456,4.506024096385542

3560472,5,B001F12ISU,"I have several DVDs by Leslie Sansone. I enjoy all of them. I would workout with one of her DVDs when the weather is inclement or too hot outside. I've actually lost 20 lbs a few years ago from using the Leslie's 2 mile Walk DVD, (I also used Tae-Bo Cardio DVD during that time as well. I alternated DVDs).  with the Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning, I like that you have the option to walk 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 miles.  I've done the 4 mile DVD by Leslie Sansone, so I had no problem walking 5 miles.  If you haven't worked out in a while, and you're trying to lose weight the right way (i.e. 2 lbs a week), not by using a fad diet to lose weight quickly, then this is a great ""starter"" DVD for you. Start walking slowly by walking 1 mile, or if you feel energetic or comfortable, switch to 2 miles. Leslie's pace is excellent for whatever mile you decide to walk.  However, I must admit that Ms. Leslie can talk a little too much, but that's just her personality (sorry Leslie). You will definitely sweat,and  Walk Away the Pounds.",1428624000,,1029,4.099502487562189

3560510,5,B001F12ISU,"FANTASTIC!!! I am not an exerciser and need to lose 40 lbs and this got me on my feet and enjoying movement and is a GREAT workout!.. It is easy to follow, Leslie Sansone is real and encouraging and you do NOT need a lot of room to do this workout at all, and you can go mile by mile, whatever you are able to do in progression.. I FINALLY have HOPE for losing this weight and being healthier.. And I was so impressed, I bought 2 more copies for my friends who want to lose weight and can't go to a gym.. (a new mom who has gained baby weight and my co worker who loves to keep moving when she can't make her aerobics class at the community center) I am sure anyone who tries this walk at home tape will totally agree with me on these points.!!  Losing weight SUCKS!!!  but This DVD makes it almost fun!",1420761600,2,803,4.0125
3560511,5,B001F12ISU,"I've been using this video since December 1st (so about a month and one week) and I've lost almost 10lbs and about 2 inches from my hip or love handles, whatever you wanna call them lol. I'm not sure of my starting weight but it was somewhere around 161-165. Now I'm at 153 lbs.

I'm a 23 year old female and 5'0"" and my heart rate monitor (Polar FT4) says I burn about 500-600 calories depending on how hard I push it that day. I'm not sure if the burn is accurate but Leslie's website does say you can burn 100-125 calories per mile. I eat around 1000-1400 calories with a cheat day of 2000 calories once a week.

 I really like this video. It's not hard on the joints and it's pretty simple. Leslie can be a little annoying but I usually have the tv down really low so I don't have to hear it lol. My only complaint is that mile 3 is a bit of a lower intensity mile and my heart rate seems to go down a lot on that one. So I like to boost it up a little on that mile. Other than that, this is a great work out! <3",1420675200,3,1016,3.898550724637681

I'm late 70's and have been doing Leslie's workouts for 5-6 months, starting with 1 mile and proceeding right along toward this 5 mile workout.  In another review of a 4 miler I took issue with her enthusiasm for jumping jacks and knee twists (my aching knee), but her boosted walking (gentle jogging) on this 5 miler is just right.  No ""you'll be sorry!"" from my bum knee or ankle - and believe me, I waited for the fallout.  But hurrah, this is one of my favorite dvd's.  What's so amazing is that the time really flies (snap your fingers) and you don't realize for a second that the miles are passing by.  If you're a senior like me, rest assured this workout is doable - and the more you do it, the more doable it becomes.",1419811200,4,826,4.262820512820513

I used my pedometer several different times and the miles are about 3/4 of a mile each.  If you do all the segments, it's about 4.5 miles total.

Leslie is authentic and encouraging. I like that I could start with the one mile walk and work my way up.  Even now that I am doing the five mile walk, there are many times that i still do the one mile walk.  When I only have a few minutes, I can pop in the DVD and do a quick workout.  No extra equipment, no crawling around on the floor, just walk.  Like Leslie says -- the down side?  My weight is down, my blood pressure down, my aches and pain down - actually gone.

I find the pace to be jumpy and off, and I find her walking partners to be very distracting.  Two if the ladies almost appear to be having convulsions over compensating for the video.  I found myself saying out loud 'What the hell is she doing?'.

Leslie is enthusiastic and energetic and  I like the idea that you know when you've reach the end of each mile. DVD's in general are great on days when you can't  exercise outdoors or at a gym.  I have several of her dvd's and use them to supplement my workouts. On occasion, I fast forward to rev it up when I want  more intensity as there's nothing too strenuous here.",1400630400,,516,4.019607843137255

If you are serious about exercise and have limited time, space, or health issues that keep you from the gym, this is a great alternative for regular cardio exercise that does the job without giving you shin splints and you never leave the comfort of your home.",1398816000,,396,4.410958904109589
3560593,5,B001F12ISU,"I purchased this DVD from a store but I loved it so much I wanted to comment on here. I was running outdoors between 3 and 5 miles a day but it rained one day so I decided to use this video. Wow! I used muscles that I had forgotten I had! I consider myself very fit so I was completely surprised at how such a seemingly simple workout could work so much of my body that I didn't know I was neglecting. Leslie incorporates arm movements into her workouts, as well. I'm actually doing this more often than running outdoors now because I get faster results. My body definition has changed and my leg strength has increased without ANY knee issues or shin splints like I get with running.

3560600,5,B001F12ISU,"This particular video gets high marks from me due to the fact that it makes completing 5 miles much easier for beginners, because it is split up by miles. Unlike,say...the 4 mile dvd which is faster paced, and runs continuously. That might be more challenging for newbies who aren't in the greatest of shape, as I once wasn't, myself. The moves are clean and simple, she explains as she goes, and her enthusiasm and positivity is inspiring. If I were to deduct points, which I won't, because I have managed to get great results out of ALL of her dvd's, I would say the music is a bit dull...some of the participants seem to kind of sleep walk their way through, and only smile when the camera is upon them, and her voice can go from gentle and soothing to shrill in the space of a millisecond. lol Overall, I adore Leslie Sansone. She is a wonderful teacher, and her dvd's are very effective and affordable. Just like they can be modified for a lower impact, they can also be modified for a HIGHER impact by punching up your own pace, and adding light weights. I, personally, use my Beachbody weighted gloves for these workouts. Also, I think one of the greatest things about her teaching is that unlike a lot of instructors, she doesn't whip right through each move at a lighting speed, and expect newbies to 'keep up' when they don't even know what the heck they're doing. Or tell you to watch 'so and so' for a lower modified version, only to have the camera pan away which makes that impossible.",1396396800,,1499,4.474452554744525

3560603,5,B001F12ISU,"This is a great, fun workout featuring many different walk boosters and including two quick miles, so you can do ""boosted walking"" if you choose to. The miles are great for mixing/matching with other workouts or doing all 5 at one time.

In mile one, Leslie and several of the walkers use 1 or 2 pound hand weights. I have done the workout with and without weights, and using them really does boost the workout.

Mile two is a boosted mile and does feature some ""gentle jogging,"" but as always, you can choose whether or not you wish to follow the boosted pace.

Mile three features the walk belt.

Mile four is another fast mile. I usually add some more gentle jogging to this one.

Mile five concludes the workout with the stretchie (aka firm band).

After mile five, there is a brief stretching session, but not much of a cool-down.

I have many of Leslie's DVDs and this really is one of the best workouts. You get a great range of activity, including strength training, but you still get all the flexibility of the Walk at Home workouts. The set is small, but the group of walkers is great and Leslie, as usual, is fun and keeps the walk interesting. The directing is much better than some of the other DVDs.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1396137600,4,1243,4.4449339207048455

I like to do 3 Miles but when I have the time, I do the full 5 and I am drenched by the end. Don't underestimate this workout.

I usually do at least 4 or 5 miles and I am amazed at how fast the time flies doing these.  I love that her audience changes in each one.  I find that it makes it more interesting and I also like that she does the 1st & 5th miles alone.  It makes me feel like I'm getting one on one attention with her.

She just needs to talk less and play better music. Her high pitch voice is annoying. She is very positive and talks about things that will help you on your weight loss journey but sometimes it can be a bit much. When I turn off the vocals its just not the same. I like the fact that she tells you what you will be doing next instead of just jumping to it. She also shows you as a reminder. Best of all, she keeps saying stuff like......as long as you continue moving its OKAY to make a mistake. Really you are in the privacy of your own home. Like I said earlier, I have so many of her videos. She gets me started again when its been awhile that I've exercised and it is a good start.

I got my husband to do one of the 5 milers with me on my 2nd workout.  He usually complains about his knees all the time and usually only goes to the gym once in a blue moon, but I didn't hear a peep the next day about his knees.  He tries to do some of the boosted walk.  This past Friday, he actually woke me up early to ask if we could do 2 miles together before work.  I am still in absolute shock over that one!  I have been on to him about getting healthy since he keeps bugging me about losing weight, so I have been firing back about people in glass houses...I guess something has finally gotten through to him. I'm enjoying getting more fit through dvd's at home, and I'm so very happy this walking dvd is something I can get him to do as well.

3560652,5,B001F12ISU,"I have over 30 Leslie Sansone DVDs and this is one of my two favorites.  They have a lot of fun in this DVD and you have a good time right along with them.

The DVD is broken up into 5 separate walks. You can choose to do all 5 or you can pick and choose one or more yourself. They also have it set up so that you can choose to do a portion of it with pre-set groupings of a few of the miles. If you go to the menu, it will give you the choices.  Its 55 minutes total.

I like the set up of this DVD a lot and the music is good.  Nothing annoying to get on your nerves.

I don't consider it a hard workout. I do the 4 Mile Express workout (and now the 4 Mile Slim Walk workout) and this is not as hard as those are by any stretch.

They are all low impact. There is one Mile on here where they do a two interval training segments (""boosted walking"") which is 90 seconds of jogging each segment, but you can just do the low impact with Mary Kay if you don't want to try the jogging.

Each mile is a different length of time. Some are 10 minutes, some are 12, and some are 15. It just depends on how fast the mile is.

The Mile 1 is with the 2 lb hand weights that come with the DVD. I bought the DVD from Leslie's website but didn't buy the hand weights. You can get these hand weights anywhere (Target, Walmart, Marshalls, etc.). I actually use the 2 lb weighted balls from her original series and it works just fine.

The Mile 3 uses her old Walk Belt. I use the stretchy band for this and adapt it to the exercises she's doing and it's just fine. You can also just use nothing and move your arms.

The Mile 5 uses the stretchy band and again you can just use nothing on this as well if you don't have one.

This is a good solid program and easy to do in terms of movements. The routines are her basic routines and moves that she's always done, just mixed around and refreshed with different speeds.

To vary it or to make it more intense, I will use the 4 lb weighted balls on Mile 1, 3 lb weighted balls on Mile 3 and the 2 lb weighted balls on Mile 5.",1383350400,4,2055,3.8642857142857143
3560653,5,B001F12ISU,"very fun, motivational and easy to follow tape (I mean, it's just walking)!  All of her moves are fully explained and demonstrated with a cast of real, live people - not fitness models. It's a good quality, decent music, set, etc. workout dvd with a program divided up between 1 and 5 miles. If you aren't feeling over energetic, just do one mile! If you want to go for it, you can easily move from one mile to the next. I enjoy it - feel like I get a good workout - and am very happy with this purchase.  It's my go to dvd when I want something different or the weather outside isn't so great.",1383264000,,594,4.112068965517241
3560654,5,B001F12ISU,"I love this DVD!  I would say that it is definitely not for the beginner unless you are only doing one mile at a time.  I have been walking for a while and do the entire 5 miles.  The different paces through each mile as well as the different movements really give a great workout.  Also, love the ""boost"" (jogging) at the end!",1382659200,,327,4.142857142857143

3560656,5,B001F12ISU,"The workout is awesome. It is low impact and really works when you are consistent. Leslie sometimes seems like the girl who can't play nice with the other children, as she laughs at the other girls and exudes sarcasm at times, but again, its about the workout so, awesome. Just ignore her antics and do it. The workout is worth your ignorance. Really.",1382227200,,351,4.587301587301587
3560657,5,B001F12ISU,"This is a GREAT workout. I am a 60 year old male, an active cyclist of 5,000 plus miles each season. The days I am not cycling, I am using this DVD, doing the 5 mile routine. ""Always"" makes me sweat. You can do each mile on it's own, or do more, you can select how many you want to do. All 5 miles takes about 1 hour to do. Each one is about 12 minutes or so. Once you get to the 3rd mile, you are motivated to keep going.
I needed some other impact workouts besides cycling (which is a low impact), and this works great for me.
I have 3 different ones of Leslie's DVD.
Walk away the pounds for the Abs 2/3 mile is also a great workout.",1381968000,,636,3.8257575757575757
3560658,5,B001F12ISU,"I love it. Total workout takes about 50 mins, each mile about 10 mins, the difficulty increases with the miles. You can decide how long is going to be your walk and how difficult it is going to be with each mile.

3560660,5,B001F12ISU,"The dvd is perfect.  I can pick up to 5 as to how many miles I want to do at one time. And Leslie Sansone is always chipper.  She has each mile workout a little different.  Mile 1 and mile 5 are with her only.  I like those 2 the best.
I like being able to pick and choose my daily workout without having to change the dvd.  And that the workouts offers boosted exercises (optionl). I could do without the identification of her helpers and without the testimonial, but that is a small complaint. The exercises are over by that time so I just close it down.",1381622400,,556,4.111111111111111
3560661,4,B001F12ISU,"I actually like Leslie's walking workouts but the pace for many of the ones I research or sample is way too slow for me. Obviously, my biggest challenge is finding one that I can use for my ""off days"" but have it still offer a little challenge. I only own a few of her DVDs, but this one is the most challenging one that I have. I do use light hand weights to increase the intensity (the movements can be too quick for heavy weights so I would caution against using what you would typically lift in strength sessions). Another way I increase the intensity is by doing many of the moves at a higher impact (e.g., changing side steps to high impact skaters). I also go the full 5 miles, which runs about an hour. I usually do this one on a weekend when I want just steady state cardio. For those of you who are advanced, I think this is a good DVD that can easily be modified for higher intensity levels.",1381536000,,902,4.189655172413793

3560663,5,B001F12ISU,I have had this DVD for a few years but I have never really used it until recently. I started walking religiously for 4 days and thus far I have lost 6 pounds. I have also added on decreasing my portion sizes for my meals. It gives me a good work out and even though there is no warm up the cool down is really good. I highly recommend this. I will give another report in 3 days to see how much I lose in 7 days. I plan to use this DVD for 30 days every single day!,1380758400,2,465,3.707070707070707

3560669,2,B001F12ISU,We use the Burn Body Fat DVD at my class and we prefer that one because of the use of hand weights.  This one is a lot of chit chat with other walkers that's unnecessary and gets annoying after you hear it over and over.,1378166400,3,220,3.888888888888889
3560670,5,B001F12ISU,I have used Leslie's workout videos for many years this is her best by far!!! I love the fact that they are fast miles and I can do just 1 or 2 miles and still feel line I have gotten in a great workout. And when I have time doing the whole 5 miles is awesome !!!,1377907200,,263,3.6315789473684212
3560671,3,B001F12ISU,"So I started this dvd out at 5, and let it gain/lose stars:

Minus 1- camera work.  Leslie must have hired family, because it's too hard to believe that she'd pay strangers for such bad work.  The camera zooms in when it should be a wide shot, goes wide when a little more zoom would be good, and invariably is tight on the faces when steps are changing, so one is awkwardly trying to get back in step.

Minus 1 - the overly-perky over-achiever in miles 2 and 4.  It's like she's supposed to be on a different set.  Very annoying and distracting.  And she's right up front next to Leslie, so it's harder to ignore her.  She reminds me of the drum major from the wii game.

Minus 1 - Mile 4.  Wow. It's so very awful. The camera work is horrendous.  Leslie talks and cackles and cackles and talks the whole mile.  Very grating.  Leslie seems uninterested in the workout and keeps being surprised when the step changes happen.  The married couple she spends so much time engaging with - they aren't so bad themselves - in fact the woman's flailing around is somewhat amusing (yes, I'm well aware that wasn't nice), but the focus on them to the exclusion of the audience is annoying.  If any of my instructors acted the way Leslie does in mile 4, I'd never go back.  The only way I can get through it now is to make my own comments (a la MysteryTheater3000).

Plus 1 - I'm losing a steady half pound a week using this workout 3-5 times a week.  (I wonder how many calories snark burns?)",1377907200,5,1483,4.292418772563177

3560673,5,B001F12ISU,"All of Leslie's videos are basically the same, but it's nice to have different people and background music to walk to when you walk with Leslie daily for years.  I have used her walking system in my home for about ten years now.  She's easy to follow; uses high and low skills so you can keep up with her at your own ability level and she's very positive and encouraging.  I truly never get tired of her, but I do enjoy having something slightly different to walk to each day.  This system lets you choose your own walking routine by selecting any one or more of the miles.  I love the 2 minute fat burning steps she does at the end of each of these miles, too.  Even if you only have 15 minutes to walk, you feel like you've done some good when you complete any one of the miles.",1376265600,,780,4.132450331125828

3560683,5,B001F12ISU,I have five of Leslie's videos but this one is my favorite. The pace of this video moves quickly enough that all 5 miles can be completed in an hour. When you have reached the half mile mark this is noted on the screen. Each mile ends with a 2 minute boost which lets you know you have almost achieved the goal of completing that particular mile which motivates you to keep with it because you are almost there. The same basic moves are used and no additional equipment is needed. The first and last mile are with Leslie alone the other miles have a team of walkers.

So many of the exercise DVDs require more space to move around than is realistic in an average home with furniture (IMHO).  Not so with this DVD.  The most you ever do is 4 steps forward or back and 2 to either side.  No moving of furniture required (which is just another reason we use to put off exercising-who wants to start off by moving furniture every time you work out to a DVD?)  Also, no complicated steps or dance moves. Walking, kicks and taps to the side, that's about it.  Believe me, the most uncoordinated person can follow her.  As much as I would love to do Zumba, I gave up after my first 2 attempts...My only complaint is the music...I would much rather have some real songs rather than the monotonous music throughout the entire 5 miles.  I realize she wants you to follow the beat and it certainly makes it easier, but it does get old after awhile. I can't report any weight loss yet, as I have just been doing it for 2 days..but it is a sweat inducing workout and I am sure I will see results soon. All this being said, I highly recommend this DVD, Leslie is exuberant, it is easy to follow her lead and the steps, and no moving of furniture required!",1368057600,,1335,4.26984126984127

3560720,4,B001F12ISU,"I have been power walking for many years. However, the last four years I have not been walking as consistently due to being my mother's caregiver. Since my mother's death, I have gradually been trying to amp up my activity level, lose weight, and become more fit. However, since I am in my mid 60's, the weight is not dropping off as it used to and it's harder to motivate myself to work out. Therefore, I have purchased a few DVDs to help motivate myself. I have an elliptical trainer, but so far I can only use it for 12-15 minutes at a time. I get on the elliptical for a few minutes, and then I walk 1-3 miles with Leslie.

I like the fact that Leslie has made this video very easy to follow, and from the first workout you feel successful. You can easily use the video for a mile or several miles according to the time and/or energy that you have that day. The last couple of minutes of each mile is when Leslie encourages you to ""boost"" your heart rate by jogging if your fitness level permits you to do so. Otherwise, you can power walk. During some of the miles, Leslie has clients and friends working out with her. Leslie points out how each exerciser is adapting according to his/her needs and abilities. You can make your workout as vigorous as you desire by pumping your arms harder, kicking your legs higher, etc.

I would have given this DVD 5 stars if the music had been a little more motivating. However, Leslie's pep talks will keep you going!",1365638400,,1460,4.344322344322344

It's nice because it breaks it down into 5 1-mile workouts with a cool down and stretch. I'm usually strapped for time, so I like it when the miles are not only marked onscreen, but divided on the DVD. She does alternate between a group and walking alone, if you prefer one or the other.

The miles are definitely at 5mph speed as opposed to many of her other single mile DVDs, which are 4mph. The only negative thing is that she doesn't have a separate warmup walk, which I always prefer, especially when the mile is 5mph. So I use one of her other DVDs to warmup and then use this one for the rest of the workout.

But I'd definitely recommend it.",1363824000,,714,4.274074074074074

I REALLY wanted a 12-minute mile workout, which this one is, but I seem to get a better workout using some of her other DVDs (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-5-Really-Big-Miles/dp/B005BX3NKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: 5 Really Big Miles</a>&nbsp;).

Leslie is in a group of walkers (which I prefer) for three of the miles, and by herself for two of them (Mile 1 and 5).  Leslie really shines in a group, and I like seeing a variety of people rather than just her.  The dark curtains on this one just make the whole studio feel ""too dark"" - I like the brighter studio used in some of her other DVDs.  I realize these are minor gripes.  I do like that you can customize the workout since the miles are divided up separately.  I also like that there are no stretchy bands or balls - it's just walking.  I do keep this in my regular rotation.  It's just not her best workout, IMHO.",1363046400,,1112,4.989130434782608

Leslie is kind of goofy and silly but I love that--she keeps me wanting to walk and I love the ladies (and guy!) she has in miles 2-4 and how she praises them and is a real person with them.

3560748,5,B001F12ISU,"As I read reviews of workouts, I always wonder about the person writing it, everyone is at a different fitness level. I am 25 years old, and at a beginning to intermediate fitness level. I bought this DVD two years ago to help me maintain my fitness during the winter. I am at an appropriate weight and am simply trying to maintain that.

This video is broken into 5 twelve minute miles. Each mile ends with a two minute boost which is a ""gentle jog"" she encourages people who can't/don't want to, to continue walking. The music is techno sounding.

Pro's:

You can choose how many miles you want to do. I often only do two of the 5 miles because that's what time allows. You can choose which mile you want to start at. After getting tired of doing miles 1&2 all the time, I started doing miles 3&4.

Each mile has different people walking with Leslie, they are average people, some larger than others, none of them look like an impossible to reach goal.

Leslie's cuing is good, she counts and tells you what is coming. The video focuses on feet until you get the movements down.

Leslie is perky and encouraging (some people find this annoying, but I prefer this than the drill type videos).

Con's

You can only get to the cool down if you select mile five, it is imbedded into the end of that mile.

For some reason Leslie's cuing in mile 4 is not up to par with the rest of the video. The video also shows more faces than feet in this mile.",1360454400,2,1445,4.302583025830258

3560775,4,B001F12ISU,"I own several of Leslie Sansone's videos and this ranks as one of my top 3 favorites.  This is a 5 Mile walk - however you can choose the miles you want to do. Like she says ""some days you may want to do 3 miles - it's okay.""  This video adds a little more sweat because each of the miles include what Leslie calls ""boosted walking"" - a.k.a. jogging, doing knee lifts and kicks at a high pace.  The music is well paced and each of the miles are 12 minutes (5 minutes of brisk walking, 5 minutes of faster walking, and 2 minutes of boosted walking.)  To break each mile down:

Mile 1 - It's just Leslie by herself.  I wish the studio wasn't so dark.  I think her videos could benefit by being outside - more scenic and inspirational.  Music isn't bad. She shows you the basic steps in this mile. She's very positive and genuine - I love that!

Mile 2 - She adds more walkers and there's more kicks in this segment.  This is one of my favorite miles.

Mile 3 - She adds another walker named Nicole who lost over 100 lbs walking. (At the end of the video, you can hear her testimony.) When Leslie moves to the boosted walking, you have the choice to do the low impact or high impact. This is true in each of her miles.

Mile 4 - This is the most annoying mile I have to say.  I hate when she asks the one woman if she ""knows"" who that guy is. And then later asks her husband ""do you know who that lady is""  - and then proceeds to harp on Tom to do the grapevines. Too chatty for my taste - let's focus on the exercise! I do like all the moves though!

Mile 5 - Leslie is by herself in the final mile.  This one picks it up a notch - more hand to knee touches.

Then there's the cool down which is exactly long enough.  Overall - I still give the video an A- (only because of the annoying mile 4!)  But I suppose you can turn the volume down and play music so don't have to listen to the chatter. :) I do love Leslie's videos - this is a good one for an intermediate level.  Her moves are easy to follow and it keeps me interested.  I've lost 33 pounds and now fit into a size 6 jeans. It works for me!",1342828800,3,2098,3.9358669833729216
3560776,2,B001F12ISU,"I purchased this dvd in March 2012.  The workout is great but all of her dvds are so cheaply made that after a couple of viewings they stop working.  The program just stops or jumps to a different part of the workout.  I have five of her dvds some from Amazon and some from QVC, all of them stop working in less than a months time.

Leslie Sansome would be wise to use better quality dvds to produce her workouts, even if they cost a little more.  It is sad, as I get a really good sweat and increase my heartrate to a working aerobic level, gut the inability to complete a workout because of the poorly made dvd has forced me to stoo using her programs and to refuse to purchase any new ones.

Please pass this information to Ms Sansome's production company

3560778,4,B001F12ISU,"I have recently started exercising again and while a lot of my friends use some of the very popular but very intense workout programs, those are beyond my ability, coordination and fitness wise. However some of my other Leslie DVDs just didn't seem challenging enough. I had been using 4 fast miles which I liked and I felt this was a good step up from that. It is true that the 5 miles are filmed separately but that was fine with me. It actually helped break up the monotony of what is a 65 minute DVD. Each mile is broken into 3 intervals of mild aerobic activity, moderate activity and a 2 minute jog. Jogging for 2 minutes is still a challenge for me but it's doable and going right into the recovery time in the next mile helps keep me motivated to get through it. While this DVD is tougher than some of Leslie's others it's definitely not what I would call an advanced workout. If you can easily jog a mile, this DVD is not for you. But for my personal fitness level it was a good fit.

There are two reasons I didn't give the DVD 5 stars. First of all, after I have familiarized myself with a workout DVD I like to turn the voices off. This is an option with a lot of Leslie's DVDs but for some reason they didn't include it in this one. And while I like Leslie, she talks A LOT. Secondly, because she recorded the 5 mile segments separately she repeats herself frequently. That wouldn't have been an issue if I could have turned off her voice but since that's not an option it started to get on my nerves.

Overall I like this DVD and I feel very proud of myself when I complete it and know I have walked/jogged the equivalent of 5 miles in an hour, something I would have a hard time staying motivated to do on my treadmill.",1340323200,,1734,4.2042042042042045
3560779,5,B001F12ISU,"I'm only 5'0 tall (sadly already fully grown) and weigh 55kg. Using a Polar HRM to monitor my heart rate, I burn 330-350 cal for an hour of non-stop jogging and 180-200 cal when I do 30 min of Hollywood Trainer. Leslie's videos are really easy on the joints. I can only do a half hour session of Hollywood Trainer before my knees start shaking from all the squats and have to stop, but with this I can tolerate doing the entire video twice a day if I really wanted to.

I managed to injure both of my inner ankles during a run 2 weeks ago (literally, I was crawling around the house on my shins for the next 3 days) so I was only following the motions in the 5 Mile without crouching low or doing the boosted jogging or putting much weight on the feet and I still burned around 270 cal for the session. I don't get sweat beads dripping down my face onto my shirt like in the other workouts but my heart rate does get to 60-70% of my max HR, which I consider is better than running or constantly doing squats which always put me into the anaerobic zone huffing and puffing. I can do the entire 5 Mile in the morning and another mile after work to burn the same amount of calories as an hour of rigorous jogging.

**Update 07/17/2012:

Hey, I've been doing this video 4,5 days a week for almost 2 months and still burning around 300-340 cal per session, now doing the boosted jog also (maybe partly due to the hot weather and my room being super hot). Anyway, I have a new calorie burning comparision that may interest people.

A few days ago I caught the Zumba hype and borrowed my friend's Zumba Exhilarate Body System to try out. I tried the Activate, Rush, Mix, and Exhilarate DVD and mix matched them to get an hour of exercise. I burned around 350 cal per hour session despite it being fast paced high intensity cardio (I do Zumba in my breezy living room so it will probably burn 30-40 cal more if I do it in hotter conditions). It has lots of hips, knee bouncing and ankle rotations that I find straining to the knee joints and ankles so I'm sticking to Leslie's 5 miles as my primary exercise routine since it burns around the same calories. I like to customize my workout by adding individual elements from other sources. Sometimes I do a minute of lunges or a few reps of the bunny hop move from Zumba at the end of the 5 miles. It's much easier for me to do these at my own pace than trying to follow the DVDs, all the while my heart rate is still in my aerobic zone from the hour long walk.",1339459200,9,2507,4.195020746887967

3560781,3,B001F12ISU,"I bought this DVD after reading a lot of the great reviews.  I must say that I was disappointed.

The Good:
-Leslie!  I like Leslie.  She is her normal chatty self and she doesn't get on my nerves.

-I like the boosted walking (ie:jogging in place.)

The Bad:
-Some of the walkers.  Two of the walkers looked like they hated being there, and there was one overachiever who seemed to try to ""outshine"" Leslie. Distracting.

-There were parts of the DVD where the music changed and the next song was not cued up.  It was a long silence before the next song.

-There were one or more times where the camera zoomed in on walkers instead of Leslie as she called for a change in steps.

-There is no warm up.

The Meh:

-The group was not with Leslie through all the miles

-The music.  Nothing to write home about

I really wanted to like this DVD because I am a Leslie fan.  I have had such a good experience with Leslie's ""Fast & Firm: 4 Really Big Miles, and Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan, but this one is lacking for me.",1338249600,3,1014,4.197916666666667

Then I have tried so many at home workouts and finally realized, they are more likely for people who have 1-80 lbs to lose.

I have had both ACL's replaced from playing league volleyball, (2nd ACL replacement I was 49 years old)and I just can't do high impact workouts.  I tried Richard Simmons workout and although his workouts are fun and high energy, my poor old knees just couldn't take it.  Sooooo, I read some reviews on Leslie Sansone workouts and started with Walk Away the Pounds  5 Day Fit Walk and I was hooked!  I own a couple businesses and it just seemed that I could never find the time to work out and did so sort of hit and miss.  The first time I tried her DVD I was just thrilled!  Couldn't believe a mile could go so fast!  Felt pretty good and thought may as well do the second mile and it went even faster!  Well, one month later I am up to 6 miles a day and honey, let me tell you, there is some serious toning going on here!  I do the workouts 6 days a week.  I MAKE time to do the workout, no actually, I plan things around my workouts.  Every day I try and hurry up and get home so I can do the workouts. I look FORWARD to the workouts.  I am disgustingly covered in sweat, heart is pumping furiously, I look like a loon and I have never felt better or have had more energy.  I get so much more accomplished at home after completing these workouts.  And surprise surprise!  I truly am walking off the pounds! I do the workouts 6 days a week without fail.  My son is getting married in August and I just bought myself a sleeveless gown.  If I wouldn't have found Leslie Sansone's workouts, I probably would have looked for something with long sleeves.

3560784,4,B001F12ISU,"This is not 5 individual walks (a 1-mile walk, a 2-mile walk, etc.), it's a 5-mile walk.  After the first mile, the DVD advances automatically to the next mile, and so on through the end of the 5th mile.  It starts off without an easy warm-up, too fast for me, and there is no cool-down until the end of the 5th mile.  I only do two miles, and I'm 65 years old. I hope to do more in time.

However, I'm glad to have this DVD because I can do my own warm-up and cool-down, and it gives me a different DVD to use. The pace is generally fast and has some higher-impact moves which you can do or not do, your choice and she says that, of course. She is tolerable to listen to, not annoying.

There are so many Leslie Sansone DVD's it's difficult to pick a good one for starting.  I emailed the Sansone website twice to ask, but got no reply.  The one I like better for beginners or seniors is ""Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection 4 Complete Workouts on One DVD."" (She's wearing a blue top on the cover.)",1336521600,4,1019,4.1421319796954315
3560785,4,B001F12ISU,"I have this video at home. The price on Amazon right now is less than I paid by a little bit. A bargain either way. I have rented Leslie's videos from the library before and enjoyed them so much I wanted one of my own, and I chose this one. It's faster-paced than her usual videos, and like others have stated there is no warm-up. You jump right into mile 1 with an elevated pace, but it doesn't kill you. The main problem I have is that they didn't normalize the sound on the part of the DVD that shows the chapters, which you see when you first pop the DVD in. The Jazz intro, while very pleasant, is way louder than any of the exercise or interview segments. This is problematic if you're like me and live in an apartment because if you are inclined to let the DVD play through to past the cool down segment it blasts the neighbors! Seriously, they could have taken the time before publishing it to normalize the sound. That's what they pay sound engineers to do on a professional recording. It's a minor annoyance, but an annoyance to me, nonetheless. Maybe the music is designed to wake you up once the workout is over, but it really kind of makes me jump out of my skin every time, and I've had this DVD a couple of months now. A workaround is to cut the sound altogether and use your own iPod music. Put together a playlist of about the same pace and just go by the visuals.

They didn't include the breakfast segment on this one like they did on another video of hers that I like; instead, there is an interview with one of her walkers that lost an impressive 100 pounds on Leslie's walking program. Walkers are a diverse mix (gender, age, race), however I found it a little amusing that one of the women who Leslie said was a veteran walker didn't seem to benefit much from the program (she's a tad chubby), but it's cool, she kept up with the rest of them all right and I'm glad Leslie had all body types out there walking. I personally, when I'm doing the exercises, don't pay attention to what the group behind the instructor is doing anyway, just because the instructor is running the class & directing the movement, not the people behind.

I also have yet to actually do the entire 5 miles at once. You can choose which mile you want to do depending on how you feel and what you have time for. The important thing is to do something every day. I personally like the last mile, and occasionally the last two miles, just because you do get the cool down if you let them play through that way. Interestingly, I can never walk at the pace Leslie has us doing when I'm out at the park on an actual walking trail. Perhaps marching in place uses another set of muscles. All in all though, I figured for the low price it wouldn't hurt to invest in myself rather than renting/borrowing videos all the time, and Leslie's videos don't leave you in pain by the end of them, unlike some others. Give me Leslie Sansone over Jillian Michaels anyday. That's just me.",1335312000,,2964,4.3195691202872535
3560786,5,B001F12ISU,"I own seven of Leslie's DVD's and this one is my favorite.  I can do a 5 mile walk in just over 60 minutes.  There are two minute boosts at the end of each mile, which are high intensity jogging.  The boosts raise the heart rate and are for a short time so most people can manage 120 seconds of high intensity.  If not, Leslie encourages people to stay at low intensity if they prefer.

I do agree that you loose a little speed between miles but I just keep up the pace from the prior mile.  I love that the miles go so fast and that she does the 2 minute boosts to get your heart rate really pumping.  You can do that or can maintain the the low impact way that the other girls show you. The miles go really fast and I really feel like I had a good workout. The full 5 miles takes only about an hour.  I can find an hour in my day to get healthy!  Try this DVD.

She isn't as preachy on this one because she's so busy moving, and that's a nice change!

I've been working out to killer programs like The Firm and various dance routines, so I (mistakenly) thought this would be too easy for me. But after injuring myself several times to the intense workouts I mentioned above, I realized I'd reached a point in my life where I needed something lower impact but as effective as possible.

Not only do I like Leslie's great personality and ability to motivate - the walking workout is fantastic! She's a lovely person, and she seems to tell me just what I need to know and hear.

3560794,4,B001F12ISU,"I've been working out every morning for the last 6 years in an effort to take off the baby weight. (Familiar story, anyone?)  I was an ExerciseTV devotee, and I've been trying to build my own library since the channel was pulled in December of 2011. As a point of reference, I consider myself ""fitter than average"" - although far from ""athletic,"" and my favorite workouts tend to be bootcamp-style, with a preference for Jillian Michaels videos. So I do like to work hard.

I don't really think anyone's body can handle high-impact aerobics, plyometrics or weight training every day, so I started doing Leslie's ""Start Walking"" videos on ExerciseTV on my the days between my more rigorous sessions. While I have to admit I found them a little silly at first, they really did grow on me. They're fun,they get the job done, and they don't hurt! When my treadmill broke and I was training for a 40 mile charity walk, these videos became a lifesaver on days when I couldn't get outside.

I purchased the ""5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"" because, with the mile markers, I figured I could do a 2 mile walk on tight mornings, and maybe 5 miles on a weekend. This was fully intended to be a workout for my lazier mornings, but I have to admit: I love it - and it's challenging!  This is really the first Leslie video I've tried that isn't too lightweight. Three miles makes a great morning workout, and really feels like I've just jogged a 5K.

While Leslie's high-pitched laugh and overly sunny attitude can seem like a lot to take for many people, I'm OK with it. Admittedly, she's perhaps a little irritating at times (really - does anyone love walking THAT much?) but it's totally worth it for this incredibly practical and effective workout. And she times her chatter well: She'll be talking about how a mile a day is just perfect for you, and you'll realize you've just spent a minute doing standing crunches as she's finishing her little monologue.

All in all, while the moves may be a little repetitious, the changes in cast and music will keep you from getting bored. And the pace is great - 12 minute miles with two minutes of ""boosted walking"" or, as you might call it, ""jogging"" in each. This is a fun, manageable calorie-burner, perfect for the advanced-beginner or intermediate exerciser who has limited time to workout in the morning, but may want to put in a full hour on weekends. It's also a great bargain. This can be broken up into workouts of varying lengths, so it's literally five workouts for the price of one.",1328572800,5,2520,4.576496674057649

There are 5 12-minute segments, each equal to a one mile walk.  You can do one segment, several segments, or all 5.  The only complaint that I have about the DVD is that the cooldown and stretch is at the end of 5th mile, so if you are planning to start with one or two miles, make sure to fast forward to the end and do the cooldown and stretch.  After you see it once, you'll be able to do it on your own at the end of any segment you choose.

Finding a workout that was interesting enough to push me further was what I was looking for, if your like me than this dvd will work for you, it seems like nothing until you get into it...once I started I couldn't stop...it works out your whole body! The first time I played the dvd I pushed 2 miles and sweated my butt off, the very next day I pushed myself and did 3 miles and so on...I read the reviews on Leslie Sansone and took a shot at her workout,it's not boring, it's easy to follow, you can stop at 1 mile or 2 miles...it's not like you have to work the whole dvd to feel it..do it at your own pace...start off with 1 mile and work our way up little by little...if your sweating it's working!!!",1322265600,,1100,4.027397260273973
3560807,3,B001F12ISU,"I've had this DVD for a few months (I use several different workout DVDs). This is my least favorite of Leslie's DVDs that I've tried.

Each mile was filmed independently from the others. There are different people in each mile; Leslie wears different clothes in each mile. One of the walkers who is on the front row moves so dramatically that I get distracted by her and lose track of what Leslie's doing!

But the thing I really don't like about this DVD is the fact that each mile starts out at a moderate pace and works up to a boosted pace of jogging. This makes me feel that my heart rate is not at its peak for very long.

...On the other hand, when I am strapped for time and can only fit in one mile, this is the DVD I use because I do feel like each mile gives me a good boost. For me and my fitness routine, that is the saving grace of this DVD - to use it for a single mile at a time. I probably would not recommend this one because there are so many other Walk at Home DVDs to choose from that are much better.",1320105600,5,1023,4.004901960784314
3560808,5,B001F12ISU,"I love Leslie Sansone workout dvd's. I now have four of them. This one shows Leslie alone at the beginning (mile 1) and at the end (mile 5). The other miles are with a group. At the end of each mile she has boosted walking ie: a gentle jog. Unfortunately I cannot do this part. I tried and it killed my knees. But as far as the rest of the workout I love it. She is energetic and gets you going. Each mile has the basic steps with a little change to each of them as you progress. Try it, you won't be disappointed. I used to go to a gym but I feel more benefit from doing her workouts because I give it my all in the privacy of my own home. I have a fan blowing on me while I am exercising because she has a fast pace going with this video.",1320019200,,740,3.811688311688312
3560809,4,B001F12ISU,"I bought this because I wanted to start increasing the number of miles I walked from 3 (which are on a number of Leslie's videos)to 4 and 5 of the weekends.  Overall, the workout(s) on this DVD is/are fine, but they're a little disjointed- each mile is a mile unto itself, rather than 5 continuous miles.  I wanted a 4 mile walk so I did the first 3 (mile 1 is Leslie by herself, 2 has a group of younger walkers, 3 has a group of older ladies) and then went to the final mile (Leslie by herself again).  The workouts themselves are standard Leslie, which are just fine with me- I know some find them repetitive, but i guess I'm the kind of person who takes comfort in repetition. None of these miles incorporate any of the walk boosters from her other workouts.  This will be another video to add to my rotation (especially on the weekends, when I actually have a full hour to devote to exercizing), and I'll probably add the 2-lb. weight belt for a little additional challenge.  However, I look forward to using the other LS video I just bought more, because it's 4 straight miles, not single miles pieced together.",1318982400,,1117,4.402912621359223
3560810,5,B001F12ISU,"This is a really good long workout. Leslie has small high impact intervals  which you may modify if you need to do so) that really get the heart rate up.  You'll be surprised how quickly you'll move from doing 1-2 mile workouts to the 5 mile.  You really only need this dvd to get started because you can start at one mile and walk through the short interval jog until you work up to it.  So it's great for working out on a budget, you don't need a gym membership or special clothes or a treadmill or a kit with 8 dvds.  Leslie is really chipper so if you're like me and hate to work out, that can be annoying, that being said she can also be very encouraging.  This dvd is actually slightly easier that the 4mile which actually has more intervals.  All of Leslie's videos are great for those of use who aren't dancers, heck knowing you're left from right isn't even required, lol!  Hope this helps.",1318809600,,899,4.27810650887574

I enjoy the walkers in each segment (except mile one which is only her) - the 2nd mile is young women and the pace is really fast and fun!

The 3rd & 4th miles are with a mix of walkers and I enjoy the fact that she encourages the viewer to workout to their own pace and not feel you have to keep up with her.

I am hoping to get a few more of her DVD's because they each have something different to offer and unlike other posters, I don't mind her chattiness - I'm there to exercise and she keeps you company!",1317859200,,722,3.8843537414965987
3560812,5,B001F12ISU,"Okay, so let me first say that I am in my early 30's. I have been buying exervise DVD's for years and have a modest little library. And it took me years to realise that I just hated impact exercise. I felt doing high impact exercises were necessary to break a sweat but they never kept me motivated for long. I started trying dance DVD's which i do like but also have not held my attention me for long. I do appreciate Leslie's DVD's. Even when you do not feel like exercising, committing yourself to one mile is not so hard that you can't pull yourself out of bed to do it. And I thought I would never really break a sweat. Boy was I wrong....I mean let's be honest I am not dripping with it or ridiculously exhausted but my heart rate gets up and i do sweat. I have also found ways to make her simple steps a bit more challenging if I want to step it up a bit. Twisting my legs inward on a knee up targets my inner thigh muscles. Doing a 'mini' squat on my tap outs (when she says turn into it). Or doing a little skip on the double side steps. That's the great thing you can step it up if you want a bit more out of it or take it easy if you need to have a lighter day. The fact is you are doing something your body will thank you for.

And Leslie doesn't really bother me with her talking. Sure she can go on a bit but her personality isn't over-bearing.
Someone commented that they did not like the wardrobe changes during miles cause they felt that the group hadn't trudged through the whole routine so it wasn't as motivational. Personally I liked it, it was good for a change so that it did not feel as monotonous, which can happen. I don't have many of her other DVD's, I did a lot of research before buying this one. And I plan to get her new '5 really big miles' next which is due out in about two weeks.

Happy walking everybody:)",1316390400,6,1842,4.0576923076923075

It has a 1/2 mile marker for each mile, and the last two minutes of each mile is boosted (gentle jog).  It goes by so fast because it has so much diversity.  I love it.

The ""boosted walk"" is a light jog that is done in the last 2 min. of each mile. I'm 45 yrs. old and I work on cement floors all day so, it's a bit much for my knees. I love Leslie but, a little less talking would be nice but, overall...the workout is a lot of fun. I would recommend this workout. It's low impact but, fast paced.

You can use weight if you want to.  You can choose to do one, two, three, four or five miles.  Each mile is a little different.  During the day you can pop it in and do one mile or whatever you have time for.  I don't know how she can talk through the whole thing but she is a good motivator and her reminders during the walk are great.  I highly recommend this one.",1315699200,,540,3.925925925925926

When I bought this tape I couldn't wait to use it.  I scheduled the time with my family so I could get the full 5 miles in, put on my walking shoes, and was ready to sweat.  One of the things I love about Leslie is that she and her fellow walkers actually sweat.  They don't have a wardrobe change in the middle of the workout and they are actually working out.  However in this tape, with each 5 miles Leslie changes her outfit.  The walkers change too and on 2 of the 5 miles it is just Leslie by herself.  Don't get me wrong, I still did the full 5 miles and it felt great but what this tape is missing is the motivation.  If Leslie and her fellow walkers can't do 5 miles at once, how does she expect us to?  Again, I love Leslie but I am very disappointed that this one isn't a start to finish motivating workout like some of the other ones.",1315180800,,993,4.01530612244898

Since you can choose any or all of the five miles, and each mile is different, the workout doesn't get boring. And each mile goes FAST. It's the equivalent of walking 5mph, which is very brisk.

At first i wasn't sure how i felt after i did 2 miles of 5, b/c there wasn't a cool down and the structure of how the music began on immediate brisk walking then boosted walk with no cool down walk (or cool down music)- you just ended on the boosted walk.  That's when i realized i had to make the commitment for the 5 miles.
First let me mention that the setting is in a spot-lit studio with wooden floor instead of the bright white-lit exercise room as seen on exercise tv.  You have Leslie alone in the 1st and 5th mile and cool down (which is only after the 5th mile) so be prepared to do the entire 5 miles to get the cool down and stretch.  Also, in the Cool Down walk i incorporated the ""heel down"" counts during some of the side to sides and walk in place, just to give more stretch in the muscles (these are done in the 1&2 mile dvd's 2nd mile)!
Overall,  keep all of your Walk the Pounds dvds.  i was going to give my mother my 1&2 mile, but decided against that, b/c i'm addicted to the in your own home gym feeling i get with that dvd.

We started with her 1, 2, and 3 mile workouts - and now are consistently doing the 5 miles four to five times a week.

3560828,5,B001F12ISU,"I am 43, about 35 pounds overweight and I walk at least 1 hour everyday to get to/from my job plus workout to kickboxing DVDs at least 2-3 times a week so I'm not exactly sedentary.  Due to my work schedule, I have very little time to work out on weekdays and I have been finding myself getting that ""dread"" feeling towards my kickboxing DVDs.  I realized I needed to find another type of workout that I can do on weekdays when my energy level is lower but something that still burns fat and helps me lose weight.

I've heard of walking workouts and was under the impression all you did was walk in place but I decided to research them anyways.  I watched some clips online of Leslie Sansone's workouts and found it was not strictly walking in place but that she also has four signature moves that looked pretty simple and I was inspired by the stories of people who have lost weight due to her walking workouts.  Despite some negative reviews on this site, I decided to buy this DVD since I really liked what I saw in the workout clip, it was 5 miles, the miles were done in 12 minutes versus her other DVDs that have 14 minute miles, the fat blasting boost at the end of each mile and no equipment/band is required.

Since I walk for at least 1 hour everyday at a rapid pace, I assumed this workout was going to be supereasy for me so I put on my 1 pound kickboxing wrist weights for more of a challenge and turned the DVD on.  Well, 3 minutes in to the workout I was huffing and puffing and had to take the wrist weights off.  Yes, I said 3 minutes.  I couldn't believe it, either.  At the end of the 5 miles, I was sweating and felt worked out.

I lack the coordination for dancy/complex workout moves and as I get older am finding high impact workouts are getting harder on my joints so I was very pleased that all of the moves were simple to follow and low impact.  Even the boost can be low impact.  Leslie's cueing was great and she was easy to follow.  The upper body is also worked out as well so you are getting a total body workout.  I usually don't like chatty people but Leslie didn't irritate me at all nor did any of her backup people.  I like that I have the option to walk 1 to 5 miles depending on how much time I have to work out.  The only cons I found with this DVD were that a few times the camera would veer off into an odd direction or briefly focus on the upper body when it needed to be focused on the lower body but these cons should not deter anyone from reaping benefits from this DVD.  If possible, it would be best to do this workout on a non-carpeted surface because I find myself not being able to keep the pace at times due to the carpet.

This video includes Boosted walking, into a light jog and other boost moves.  Leslie makes it easy to do either the low-impact walking & moves, or the boosted moves.  I never thought I would jog, but found I could do it with Leslie, amazing!

I like to do One Mile in the morning and One Mile in the evening - so I get 30 minutes of good exercise and it does not seem like a chore!

Also included is a short cool-down and stretch, although it is not on the Menu.  It is at the end of Mile 5, and it is easy to use the track button on your remote to get to it if you don't want to do Mile 5.  I would like it better if it were on the Menu.

Miles 1 and 5 are just with Leslie, and Miles 2, 3, and 4 are with Leslie and a group.  The group is nice because they are regular people, not fitness models, and it is interesting to see how different each person does the Walk with Leslie even though they stay in sync.
One thing I like about Leslie is she will remind you to do what is right for you, so if kicks are not good for you that day, you can keep walking instead and you won't feel bad that you can't keep up.

Bonus track is an eight minute interview with Nicole, who lost over 100 pounds walking with Leslie.  Nicole is in the group segments of the workouts too.

I really enjoy this particular group of workouts with Leslie, and highly recommend this DVD.  I find Leslie motivating, upbeat, and habit-forming!  Leslie has two beginner workouts at Realage.com (as of this writing) so you can see if you like her style or not.

I don't do each of the boosts because I've got some knee problems but the pace keeps you moving so quickly that if you're doing a power walk during the boosts it is still great. I also love the music in this one although the mix of music to her speaking could be better. The music is a bit too quiet for me.

Then she switches to a very brisk pace, and then at the end, 2 minutes of jogging.  Because of a previous ankle injury I can't do the ""moves"" while jogging, but it is addictive and fun just jogging in place with leslie.  The cool down and stretch is a little quick for my tastes, but you could always repeat it if you need more.  Leslie's chattering only gets out of control in the fourth mile when she starts giggling and joking about the upcoming wedding two of her ""walking buddies"" will be attending.  In the other miles her talking is upbeat and encouraging-- personally I like her talking (most of the time!) because it motivates me and makes the walks go by faster.

The main thing I don't like about this dvd is the black background with the walkers wearing black clothing!  Sometimes their legs and torsos are invisible!  I hope in her next production she is more careful.  Also there is no option from the dvd menu to go to the cool down, so you have to fast forward through the fifth mile to get to it.  The dvd did not work on my laptop (dell inspiron) but works fine on my husband's ibook, and the regular dvd player.  Overall those are small drawbacks to an otherwise great dvd.

I LOVE these Walk at Home videos and Leslie Sansone and have purchased about 10 DVD's!  It's easy, it doesn't take a lot of space, it keeps me motivated (the treadmill was B O R I N G), and I really work up a sweat.

This video is my favorite so far because there is a boost at the end of each mile that you can do or not do (it depends on how my knees feel that day).  I can do 1 to 5 miles depending on how much time I have and how I'm feeling...but I always end up doing the 5!

I have found the answer to my cadio problems and I can't be happier that I found this program and this instructor!

I actually can't wait to get home from work and hit the rec room to start my walks!  Love it!",1303344000,,1027,3.9466019417475726
3560842,4,B001F12ISU,I try to do this workout at least twice a week.  This is great when you have a longer period to workout. To do the full 5 miles takes an hour but it doesn't seem that way. I really like how she divided the miles up. Every mile includes a different group or combination of people which keeps it interesting and also allows you to choose if you'd like your favorites.  I enjoy the fact that there is boosted walking at the end of every mile. It gets your heartrate going! This is a great one to do for the aerobic benefit and weightloss because of the amount of miles.,1302912000,,566,4.136363636363637
3560843,5,B001F12ISU,"First let me say that I started using Leslie's walking tapes recently. I had 2 knee surgeries for torn meniscus in the last year and I also have Arthritis in my knees and elswhere.  I have about 4 of her other walking tapes--Over 40- 2 mile, Her Walk the Walk Christian 1 and 2 mile, Walk away the pounds 3 miles and another 1 mile for beginners.  I just recently purchased the 5 mile Fat burning DVD...  I am so hooked on Leslie's walking program-and for me that is pretty amazing,  because I have been overweight most of my life and I have led a pretty sedentary lifestyle... After my knee injury last year--I ended up gaining more weight and became the heaviest I have ever been in my life and i just got sick and tired and knew I had to do something.  I also aquired a recumbent bike from my mother in law to help with my knee and weight loss. I also started a walk for women at my church using the 2 mile walk the walk dvd (2-3 days per week).  I have also started inspiring others to start walking with Leslie as well.  I have boutght other tapes and dvd's in the past and always got bored and never did anything with them, But I am happy to say that I look forward to these walks with Leslie and I am 30 pounds lighter with inches lost as well.  All My clothes are getting loose on me and I am just amazed.  I still have a long way to go on this journey, but I know with Leslie's Inspiration, Encouragement, and Motivation she gives while working out with her--I will reach my goal and I will never, ever quit--even after I have reached my goal... This is definitely a lifetime change for me... I would like to encourage anyone who is looking to workout to get healthy, to give this a try--even if you have arthritis or other ailments as this is low impact and easy to follow-Even if you cant do something inparticular-she tells you that its ok for you to just keep walking.  I used to hate excersise but this is fun and I don't even think twice about working out anymore & I am happy to say It is now apart of my daily Life..

I thank God for Leslie and how she is helping so many to become healthier and happier- Thank you so Much, Leslie--I just wish I had found you sooner! I Pray that I can help and encourage others to do the same.. There is nothing more important than getting healthy so we can be everything that God has called us to be and to be there for our loved ones.  I hope this review helps you all!

To your Success in a healthier lifestyle!

God Bless,

3560844,4,B001F12ISU,"I have been a fan of Leslie for many years. I was glad to see that she put out a more advanced workout. Even though it contains the same basic moves as all of her other DVDs, this one if more fast paced and a more challenging workout (challenging in a good way) than many of her others.

Over the years, I have lost 40 pounds thanks to these workouts and I am glad that she keeps on putting out a variety of them.",1302393600,4,413,3.9166666666666665

3560849,5,B001F12ISU,"I have been doing Leslie Sansone workouts for years. I still have VHS tapes of some of her earlier stuff. After gaining weight with pregnancy and just not loosing it, I decided it was time for a change. I bought this DVD and the Big Burn 2 mile interval DVD. I will say that I don't even do the interval 2 mile DVD anymore because I love this one so much better.

The mile is quick. 12 minutes and towards the end of the mile you do gentle jogging for 2 minutes. I love how the miles are broken up and I love Nicole's story!
So far I have lost 15 pounds since I started to do this workout. I usually do 2 miles during the week, 3 miles on Friday and then 4 miles on Saturday. I haven't been able to make the whole 5 miles, but one day I will!",1300233600,,742,3.8815789473684212
3560850,5,B001F12ISU,"I just received this DVD 2 weeks ago.  I have some other leslie Sansone DVDs, but this is by far my favorite.  It is high energy, quick paced and gets you going quickly.  There is a shorter and quicker paced warm up than on her other DVDs which I love. Each mile is 12 minutes, the last 2 minutes of each mile are a boosted walk (read jog!  But half of the walkers stay at a power walk so you can do either).  I like that you can choose to do any of the 1 - 5 miles.  There are different people walking on each mile so that serves as some nice variety.  Leslie keeps your mind occupied while you are walking so that the time goes by quickly.  These are super fast paced, and high energy miles.  They are more intense than any of the other DVds that I have and I feel like I am getting a better workout with this.  I would recommend it.  I think that it is a more advanced workout than some of the others.",1299283200,,904,3.9392265193370166

You can do low impact or high depending on the condition of your joints and muscles and ability to balance.

Running, Yoga, Circuit Training and Weight Training have been my normal gamut.  So yes I was poo-poohing this idea.  But I wanted another cardio workout dvd to add to my workout library. So I purchased it and then I did it.  Yes it makes you sweat, move and have simple fun.  Nothing too strenuous. But I did feel my core more engaged throughout.  I love it when I get up at 5am and don't strain myself too much, but feel I have got myself moving in the right direction. That is a 5 mile good direction.  Try it.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I love that it has the option to TURN OFF the voice direction (which could be annoying after awhile).",1299110400,,799,4.225165562913907
3560853,5,B001F12ISU,"About 2 years ago I was told that I had high cholesterol. I made a choice not to go on a pill but rather
take care of it myself.  I started a healthy diet and began to exercise. I purchased Leslie Sansone's Walk
Away the Pounds Express, 4 mile.  I started off slowly and walked my way to doing 4 miles. I began to see the
pounds come off and 3 months later I went back to the doctors and my cholesterol lowered dramatically.
  I continued my quest in getting in shape and purchased other dvd workouts including Jillian Michaels and
then buying the extreme Insanity series workout. I had advanced that much in pysical activity and it paid off.
However I was burned out by the intense workouts and came back to my favorite ...Leslie Sansone.
  I purchased her 5 mile Fat burning walk and I simply love this dvd. It gives me what I need daily and that is a do-able walking routine to stay in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Yes you can lose weight by walking. I am living proof and I personally believe it is the best way to go in getting and staying in shape. I fluctuate the workouts every other day with some strength training and floor exercises. Walking is the perfect workout. I highly
recommend this DVD !",1298592000,,1217,4.3392070484581495

It's fast enough to really be aerobic, but not so fast that I can't keep up.  It's the perfect workout for me.  I liked it so much that I recently purchased the 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk.  Love it too!  Can't say enough good things about it.  It's basically the same moves, just more boosts so that you can get in 5 miles in one hour.  So now I workout at a fitness center in the mornings and rotate the videos in the afternoons.  Highly recommend them both!",1297900800,,561,4.027272727272727
3560857,3,B001F12ISU,"I just finished doing this DVD for the first time. Let me preface this by saying around 2:00pm today, I did a 5 mile walk/run on my own in less than 50 minutes followed by heavy lifting. It was 9:00pm when I did this DVD. I say this so that people can have a better perspective of where I'm coming from in my review.

This DVD is probably very good for beginners. However, it did nothing spectacular for me. I think that what takes away from it is the fact that each new mile starts off slowly. So you start at moderate walking, then fast walking, then ""boosted"" walking only to segue into another few minutes of moderate walking in the next mile. Had there been an ever-increasing tempo so that by mile 4 the music was at 160-175 beats per minute, that may have been more feasible for more advanced exercisers.

What I did like was in the 3rd mile when Leslie walked over to the African-American lady with her chit chat and the lady looked at her as if to say, ""please don't come over here talking to me."" That was hilarious to me. Also, the lady who felt the need to high-five other walkers was over the top to me.

Anyway, beginners will probably find this challenging. Advanced exercisers may find this useful on a light day.",1297382400,3,1229,4.334782608695652

3560865,4,B001F12ISU,"I purchased this DVD, given the good reviews and my need for lower-impact workouts for my recovery days (I like to work out 5-6 days/week as an intermediate/advanced exerciser, but I can't be doing very intense workouts on consecutive days). I tried this DVD for the first time, and barely broke what I would consider a decent sweat from the aerobic walking routine Leslie demonstrates. I wanted a low-key workout, but this was way too low-intensity for me, even on a recovery day. I could appreciate how this workout would actually be an excellent alternative for those rehabilitating from injury, surgery, or being sedentary/inactive for a long time. The second time I tried this DVD (giving it another shot), I used 2-pound hand weights in each hand, and got a little more creative with Leslie's trademark basic walking moves: While doing power-walking with Leslie I did double-arm biceps curls and triceps kickbacks; while doing knee-lifts, I did overhead presses or chest presses; while doing lunging touch-steps, I would perform alternating punches; and while side-stepping, I did chest-flies in front of my body. I would also combine chest presses forward with rowing movements while side-stepping with hamstring curls along with Leslie. With forward-kicks, I would do chest presses. Even during the ""boosted walks"", I would continue doing these upper body exercises, and would occasionally sync them to Leslie's cues when she would also do upper body movements. I was satisfied with the extra aerobic demands that this repeated strength training with light dumbbells was doing (sweat was certainly dripping down my face with these additions), and as an added bonus, my upper body was satisfyingly sore for 4 days afterwards, as if I had done a very intense, heavy weight-lifting routine.

I am pleased that with my own addition of continuous upper-body, low-weight, high-repetition strength work, this 5-mile workout proved to be not only relatively low-impact and gentle on the lower-body joints, but also a good one to emphasize upper body strength (with added calorie-burning and amplified cardiovascular benefits to boot). Also, the ""choreography"" Leslie uses is pretty much an no-brainer; she does the same basic 4-5 walking moves in all 5 miles, so even though I can see how some might be bored by the repetition over time, at least one doesn't have to think much about what comes next while coordinating upper-body strength moves along with the walking moves. There is very little dread factor, as well, since the moves are so easy and predictable. Miles 1 and 5 are done with Leslie by herself, and the others are done in a group. I didn't mind Leslie's chattiness or her reference to ""raising your hands to heaven for a blessing"" (I'm a committed agnostic), as she nevertheless seemed personable, friendly, and generally fun-loving. Given that walking itself is repetitive by nature and can be more fun while chatting with friends in a group, I think she has the right idea of making this workout feel like an entertaining communal activity that can be enjoyed among friends. The instrumental music was okay with a techno-synthesizer-type sound, not too obnoxious or distracting. Each 12-minute mile is started with a slower tempo rhythm, then speeds up after 3-4 minutes to a faster tempo, and in the last 2 minutes the tempo is at a maximum, when the ""boosted walking"" (a.k.a. light jogging) segment begins. The miles can be split up to customize a workout into different durations, as well.

I would recommend this fairly versatile, non-intimidating workout to those who would like low-intensity exercise to recover physically (either from harder workouts, post-surgical rehabilitation, illness, frailty, etc.), those who are starting an exercise-regimen for the first time, or those who want a moderately intense, low-impact cardiovascular workout (using light hand weights for added strength and cardiovascular challenge).",1294963200,4,3944,5.219242902208202

3560868,4,B001F12ISU,"This is my first Leslie Sansone walking dvd.  I was hesitant about getting any of her walks after reading many reviews - the good, the bad and the ugly.  While at Walmart one day I saw this dvd, and said, Why not?  Okay, I brought it home and played it all the way through and thought it wasn't too bad.  The next day I tried out the whole 5 miles.  It definitely got me sweating.  I'm 53 and am having problems with my ankle and knees.  Because I kept it low impact, especially with the boosted part, I had no problem with my ankle.  With the side steps, I made the mistake of squatting down a little and felt my knees.  Now I know to do the whole thing standing upright and it won't hurt my knees.  As for Leslie's incessant chattering, well, I'm good at tuning people out.  I'm married to a man who has diarrhea of the mouth, so I have a lot of practice.  I give this 4 stars because it's the same moves for basically all 5 miles.  I can see where it would get boring doing this everyday, so I will be alternating this with some of my other low impact cardio workouts.

Great exercise DVD for Intermediates and possibly even Advanced people too.  I work out everyday for 30-90 minutes.

Don't get me wrong. You DO get an energetic, fast paced workout on this tape but the flow and the fun one can have doing the 4 FAST MILES doesn't seem to exist on this tape. In 4 FAST MILES you have five sets of intervals. The same group of exercisers is doing them throughout. In this tape you have five 12-minute mile segments, the first and last Leslie is doing the routine by herself, the others are seperate miles done by the group. You can do them altogether but they ARE broken up. The reason Leslie gave for doing this was to ""customize your walk by mixing and matching the miles to create your own personal workout for pure fat burning fun. You can choose 1,2, 3, 4 or 5 Miles!""  That might work for some but it just doesn't cut it for me. I LIKE doing the whole routine with the same group of people. That being said this is still an effective workout. I particularly liked miles 2 and 5. The music on mile 5 is especially appealing. As Leslie states early on walking is the ""most natural way to improve your health by losing weight"". She literally teaches you to ""walk like a runner"".  She reassures you from the beginning that ""It's not about learning steps. It's about moving to the pace of the music."" I might like 4 FAST MILES better but this tape is still an attractive alternative for an effective exercise program.",1281571200,,1715,4.947916666666667
3560881,2,B001F12ISU,"Let me preface by saying that I really wanted to like this DVD.  The workout itself is fun, and I liked the choice of music, more so than some of the other Leslie Sansone videos that I own.  However, a few key issues kept me from rating this workout three stars or higher.  Firstly, the long pauses between music was annoying--they couldn't cue up the pace changes more efficiently?  Secondly, they again cut away to other walkers during footwork changes (a problem I've noticed with a couple of other Leslie DVDs), making keeping in step a little tricky.  Thirdly, some of Leslie's dialog when she's walking alone seems awkward and strained.  But the main point that seemed unprofessional and irritating was the distraction of a couple of key walkers in her walking group.  People who have seen the video I'm sure know who I'm talking about (another reviewer dubbed them  ""The Cheerleader"" and ""Shark Woman"").  These particular walkers seem to have confused ""enthusiasm"" with ""annoying.""  Why would you feature walkers who detract from Leslie's leading of the group?  In the fourth mile they stick the Shark Woman in the back row, but unfortunately The Cheerleader remains in her key spot directly next to Leslie.  Simply put, these women were distracting enough that I couldn't enjoy the segments at all.

On a positive note, I am able to combine a few of the individual miles with other miles from other Leslie DVDs that I own, thus giving myself a more personalized workout and salvaging some of the money spent on this video.  But for an all-around single DVD experience, I'd stick with her 5-Mile Advanced Walk or her ""Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles.""",1281139200,9,1659,4.795774647887324

While I was doing the workouts, even though I worked up a great sweat, I didn't realize how potent it was until I woke up this morning. Each mile went really fast...I liked how it was slower in the beginning, bumped up 1/2 way through each mile, and then boosted at the end. I know that I am getting a great workout because this morning I was extremely sore...muscles worked very hard...especially back muscles.  This is my 3rd Leslie Sansone dvd that I purchased (5 Day fit, 3 mile walk a way the waist with the walk belt, and 5 mile fat burning) I love all three...and will each of them to vary my workout, so my muscles don't get used to the workouts.

Like the instructor and find her to be both positive and informative, without being a ""pom-pom girl"". Each mile adds something new, and the mile markers are a great option--there is no way I could do all 5 miles at once, at least not yet!

Much prefer exercising at home rather than at a gym, and LOVE being able to ""take a walk"" right in my own livingroom regardless of weather or time of day.

Definitely recommend.

Edit: Two days later, I've now done all five miles and really enjoy how each one is a little different. There is only one mile [#4] where I felt she was somewhat distracted with chit-chat, and the camera was not always where it needed to be. Still, I got a great workout and some good information. Definitely plan on continuing with this DVD and look forward to the day when I can do all five miles at once.

There are five miles here, the first and the last with just Leslie and the middle three with some of the 'walkers'.  Each mile takes about 12 minutes, and is very intense.  You can choose to do one mile, any combination, or all five miles.  As always, Leslie notes that you can modify (within reason, of course) the workouts.  As a personal preference, sometimes I find Leslie's 'cheeriness' a bit annoying but it's way better than being barked at, drill instructor style.

The 3 other miles in the middle has lots of 'girlfriend' talk and talking about other people's lives and a bunch of miscellaneous crap that I didn't mean to pay for.  If I wanted to walk with a group, I will go to the gym.  These miles are about 12 1/2 minutes long and there is a Boost (mild jogging) for the last two minutes of each mile - it is a good workout and it will make you sweat.  I just don't like all the distractions.

I also didn't like the big 1,2,3,4,5, mile marker number flashing on the bottom left of the screen, that was also distracting to me.  I expected it to maybe flash numbers where you had walked 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 mile but that didn't happen.  In her 'Walk Your Belly Flat' 3-mile walk - there is a clock ticking down in the right top corner and that was an incentive to keep moving for just a few more minutes.  I wish that was in all her videos.

Loved it!

March 11, 2012--Just wanted to add--I have used the tape over time and still enjoy it a lot.  It's a great and relatively simple, but not easy, workout.  It's not exciting, and it gets a bit repetitive (how many ways can you talk about walking on a long tape?) but once you get used to it, you could potentially turn down the sound and listen to music while you walk along with Leslie.  You can decide how many miles you want to go at any time--it's split up by miles, so you can do one or all five miles at a time, depending on time and inclination.  I got out of it for awhile and now plan to break it back out again now that spring is on the way.  It's a good way to jumpstart a weight loss or workout program.",1279756800,,1077,4.080568720379147

I liked the end where it shows a bit of information on each of the walkers.

One of the things that I have noticed over the last year or so is how my posture has improved with Leslie's instruction for aligning your spine.  I have never quite understood the pretending that there is a string being pulled from the top of your head, but Leslie's pulling the belly button in, stacking shoulders over hips, and retracting the shoulder blades has really help me to stand and walk tall.",1279238400,,711,3.937062937062937

I used this DVD for the first time today, and I felt great afterward. I never had to stop to catch my breath, because Leslie motivates you to go at your own pace and walk to the music.

All in all...
1. Leslie is super enthusiastic, and it is very genuine, unlike most other fitness video instructors. I appreciated her motivating and honest attitude. Also, I liked how she was not a stick-figure instructor, her body is fantastic and very fit.
2. You really do not need to be extremely coordinated to pick up the moves she uses, which is great; it allows you to keep your heart rate up without struggling to form the right movements.
3. It is fast-paced and will build up a good sweat. It is not ""intense"" but it is high-impact, and I will definitely be using this to supplement the jillian Michael's DVDs and 10 minute solution DVDs I regularly use.

I love to do 3 or 4 miles of this video to add to my workout on ""cardio"" days. I do have to tone Leslie's comments out, and prefer the miles when its just her. Some of her back-up walkers are really hard to watch! This is the perfect Leslie video for me because of the ""boosted walking"" sections at the end of each mile.

I got this dvd and I fell in love with Lesile's style.  I walk with her 5-6 days a week and have done this for the past month in a half.  I have lost about 8 lbs and several inches. I can really tell a difference on the areas around the middle.  My daughter even gets involved with me and asks me every morning when we are going to ""walk"". I usually do all 5 miles for a maximum calorie burn. I find this dvd to go by very quickly for 65 minutes of walking.  I LOVE the BOOSTED walk at the end of each mile.  It is a light jog that feels really good without leaving me winded.  I am a petite person and have added some pounds over the last 5 years that I need to get off and I think Lesile will help me do that.  I am very excited to work out with her.  I have some other dvds of hers that were given to me after I bought this one because I raved to my mother in law about Lesile and she said that she had some that I could have.

I purchased a calorie burn monitor that I wear on my arm which programs how many calories you a burn a day so I have put this DVD to the test.  I burn the most calories with Leslie's DVDs than any other and I own many.  I truly think it's because your heart rate stays elevated for an extended period of time (about 50 minutes to do 4 miles)  The days I work out with this DVD and just do my normal walking for the day, I burn an astonishing 2,000 calories a day.  I was a strong advocate for the all the ""Biggest Loser"" DVDs but for some reason, I burn more calories with this simply walking routine Leslie created.  I have read people say it's too easy.  Yes, the moves are simple but if you do all 5 miles, you definitely sweat and it's NOT easy to complete all 5 miles with boosting at the end of each mile for 2 minutes.  I never sweat and this DVD makes me at least break out in sweat and most don't at all.  I have not been able to go past 4 miles in a row yet.  I'm in my 40's and workout about 6 times a week and would consider myself in decent shape and don't find this DVD easy AT ALL.

Leslie herself is a bit on the goofy side, but her enthusiasm is infectious.

Consistent steady cardio like works best for me in terms of exercise and I work from home, so being able to ""take a walk"" during an hour or so break during the day without leaving in case I get a business call is ideal!

I started right off the bat with the complete 5 mile option and found it a satisfying workout, if fairly easy. The first day, I actually did it once in the morning and once in the evening for a total of 10 miles that day. None of the movements are difficult to follow and I appreciate that each mile is about 12 minutes, which means that it's a quick enough pace to keep the heart rate up effectively.

Leslie uses ""real people"" (read: people who aren't fitness pros) in her DVDs to illustrate the movements which is nice, although I personally also appreciate seeing people in my workout DVDs who give me a physique to aspire to.

I could see myself using this DVD consistently and long-term 5 to 6 days a week, once or even twice a day if I'm feeling froggy...

As long as I do what I did on my second time around doing this workout:

Turn the sound off and listen to something like talk radio instead while following the movement on the screen.

I appreciate that Leslie is passionate about what she does and attempts to impart positivity and encouragement.
However her constant goofy laughter, awkward seemingly-forced banter, and enthusiasm that comes across as being about as real as Pamela Anderson's chest. It's a turn-off.

It's just my personal preference, but I find her demeanor and personality so grating and annoying that I might've decided to ditch this one if I had to keep her turned up to follow the vocal cues instead of just following the action.

Which is a shame, because she offers a legitimately valuable program that people can follow easily and consistently and see results.

Also, there are a myriad of thinly-veiled references to her Christian faith within the dialogue that may not be to everyone's liking or comfort level. Conversely, if you like that in your workout videos, you may see it as a bonus.",1271635200,4,2152,4.52319587628866

There's an interview on the DVD with a woman who became more healthy using Leslie's DVDs. Not sure this was the best interview she could have selected but good.

The menu is ok. You select which mile - how many miles - you want. Leslie is alone in this DVD as she is lately. The walk is a power walk - you walk back and forth and really put some effort into it. Each mile is twelve minutes. There is a brisk warm-up. There's a mile marker on the left bottom of the screen. The music is good and keeps the beat. There's a boost at the end of each mile. It's two minutes. It's basically a gentle jog. This is the best, fastest way to drop pounds. Sure works for me. So, this is a fat burning walk.

If you want to walk just one mile, it's best to stop at mile five. She does a brisk warm-up here. The warm-up is perhaps a bit short here. Then you get the walk and finally a cool-down.

I don't like the fact that if you do the first mile only, or perhaps one of the other ones, there's no cool-down. I think it should stop and let you select a cool-down. Other than that, this is an excellent selection.

As I've said in my other Leslie reviews, I'm losing from one to two pounds a week walking just one mile every day or so. No change in diet. So, I highly recommend this, or any, of her videos or DVDs. You just need to do what you can do and it's very enjoyable. The walk makes you feel good the rest of the day and you have more energy. If you didn't lose an ounce, that would be worth the cost of the DVD.

Each 12 minute mile is pretty much the same thing over and over, thus the comment of it being boring.

Not nearly as challenging, and I am a 44 year old, not very active, just started exercising, woman!  Also, as many have mentioned, there are a couple really irritating women with her in the middle miles, but I can certainly overlook such things if the workout is good.  Which this one isn't.

I have two bad knees from years of running and dancing, and this video has been a real blessing. After my first time working out with it, I knew I was going to be hooked. The energetic walk was not hurtful or pounding to my knees at all, and at the end of the first mile (approx 10-12 minutes) I was feeling the endorphin-breakthrough feeling that happens at the end of a really good run and was high on life for the rest of the day.

Also...I have recommended this video to friend who has had several knee surgeries and he says that it is just right and he feels no stress on his knees either.

There are five selections on this video from about 10-14 minutes each. During the course of each 1 mile segment in the video, Leslie tells us when we are at the 1/2 mile mark, so this has allowed me to go from walking 1 or 2 consecutive miles, to also giving me the option of doing 1.5 miles if I choose. She is fun, motivating and so natural. Two segments are her by herself, and three segments are with a group, including one segment with a male in case your own bf or hubby might think it's too much of a girly thing.

The pace of the 1 mile walk is just perfect for getting the heart rate up while still feeling good and not over exerted. I really enjoy it.

DH has really been getting into it and I am so thankful! He says (and I agree!) that if there were no other benefit to it but feeling how good the body feels at the end of just 1 mile, the video would still be worth it.  :D

I looked into her other videos and hoped that there would be something similar or different but they all seem to run 30 minutes in duration for a segment. I really prefer having the shorter segments and choosing how long my workouts are going to run for in this video and hope I can find others where she breaks them down into short segments like this.

It has been a couple of weeks and I do feel and see results already. I'm actually looking into finding local power walking clubs and 5k walks locally because of how easy this has been!",1269388800,,2374,4.110151187904967
3560915,5,B001F12ISU,This is one of those workouts I look forward to doing. Some I do out of necessity but this one I really do  enjoy. I enjoy Leslie's chipper and encouraging attitude.

It gets your heart beating and at the end you feel like you got a good workout.  I have a problem knee so am always looking for new workouts that are not too high impact.  This was just enough.,1267315200,,355,4.014285714285714
3560919,5,B001F12ISU,I think this is a great dvd. I have lost weight using this dvd. It is great. I like this dvd because my daily exercise is walking outside. When the weather is not great outside I still can exercise. I would tell people who don't exercise to please start with this dvd. It is a great product to get you motivated. If you are like me sometimes I don't like to do exercise by lying on the floor. This dvd is great and also I like the music.,1266796800,3,437,3.977272727272727

Mile 1 - I was like yeah okay... what's next?!!! Well, Mile 2 was!!! I was able to finish mile 2, but I had no strength to continue to mile 3. This video is wonderful!!! Especially for those cold and/or rainy days in which you can't go work out outdoors, cause I can't take my baby w/me.?... I recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!",1266364800,,592,4.02542372881356

I like the interview at the end of the video. I like Leslie's positive motivation. But it does seem randomly put together at the last minute. And the chatter is a little much too. This won't keep me from buying other videos of her's. And since I paid for it, I will continue to use & change it up with my other videos, but it's not at the top of favorite's list. I do like her sleek & slim video better, and a 2 mile video from a few years back when it was Walk Away the Pounds. They seem more professionally done.",1266364800,8,674,3.856115107913669
3560923,3,B001F12ISU,"This workout is fine, but I like several of her others more.  Because of the flexibility of choosing how many miles you want to do, each mile is rather stand alone (no warm-up, cool down).  I do like the 2-min. jog in each mile.  It's still a great way to get a workout in in a very limited space at home.",1266364800,2,305,3.9672131147540983
3560924,5,B001F12ISU,This dve is great because you can make it as hard and as long as you want.  You can do just 1 mile at low impact or you can do all 5 miles and add intensity with punches and weighted hand gloves.  I LOVE this dvd!  The other great thing is that the time goes by sooooo quick.  Definitely a new staple of mine.,1266278400,,309,3.78125
3560925,4,B001F12ISU,"I own 3 Leslie Sansone dvd's & this is the least favorite of the three, mostly because it doesn't have a huge variety of workouts. I love the 3 mile weight loss because it incorporates weights in miles 1 & 3 and the middle mile is a high-paced Mary Kay mile. My other fave is the 5 day fit walk, which uses weights in some of the segments as well as a fun kickboxing (called walk & kick) section. The 5 day fit walk is great for mixing & matching, especially if you alternate days with/without weights. As I said, this 5 mile walk isn't bad, it just gets a little repetitive. The boosted walking (low-impact jogging) does the trick in increasing heart rate and the miles do go rather quickly so I will do this one in its entirety; if I have less time, I use the other ones. Not quite 5 starts but not too bad either. It gets you through the winter months when walking outside is difficult.",1266278400,,889,4.204678362573099
3560926,4,B001F12ISU,"Before the heavy snowfalls in VA I was outside doing a run/walk routine of 1-2 miles.  I'd try to get out at least twice a week but now the huge snow piles, sandy sidewalks and icy roads have put a damper on that.  This DVD is a great solution for me and I've really enjoyed walking indoors!  I love that the routine is fast paced and really makes my legs feel the burn.  I've been doing 3 miles and finish with a good heart rate and I'm definitely sweating.  I'm 5'11"" and it's a bit of a challenge to move as quickly as Leslie and her team, but I just go at a pace that feels right for my long limbs.  If you are looking for an exercise video that doesn't require a lot of room to move about but will get you moving, this DVD is for you!!  I'm sure I'll get back outside after the big thaw, but in the meantime I'll workout with Leslie.",1266192000,,838,3.9820359281437128

I found this DVD and it was just what I needed.  It is hard enough to do some good, but you can start out slow enough that a lazy old fat woman like me can do it.  I was told that the 'no pain, no gaim' rule does not apply to seniors, so I started with a half mile the first three days, then started doing a little more each day and putting a little more effort into it.  I haven't had it quite two weeks and this morning I made a mile and a half.  I've only lost two pounds so far, but I feel so much better.  Now, when I stand up, I can start walking right away instead of standing there several seconds, telling my feet how to move.  I'm feeling better and walking taller.  I sleep better at night and I have more energy.  I highly recommend it, especially for seniors.",1265760000,5,945,3.978723404255319

3560933,4,B001F12ISU,"Another wonderful workout from Leslie. The only reason I give it four and not five stars is that as each mile ends, Leslie does slow the workout down just a bit to transition into the next mile. Yet it picks up again and each mile ends with a high powered ""boost"" option (light jogging) so your heart rate is still up enough to get some good exercise. Some viewers might welcome this transition time but others might be disappointed the aerobic exercise doesn't keep the heartrate up at the same pace continuously.
The DVD set up lets you choose to ""walk"" one, two, three, four or all five miles. Or you can just do the third mile one day, the second mile another day, etc...
Leslie is more inspiring than ever on this DVD. She's so encouraging and upbeat you feel like you're exercising with a good friend and you'll look forward to doing it.
I'd love to see Leslie put out a super high powered ""walking"" DVD for her more advanced ""walkers."" I've watched some of her older, high energy workout tapes but the moves used are not as easy to follow as her now standard ""walking"" moves (walking, kicks, knee lifts, side steps). On this DVD it's great how she offers viewers the option to intensify these moves with, for example, side lunges for side steps, light jogging for kicks, and upper torso moves with knee lifts). She doesn't do that throughout this entire DVD but she does it enough to offer a more intense workout to anyone who wants to try it.
This is a very good (and fun) exercise DVD for Leslie fans.",1264636800,,1510,4.4548736462093865

Ahhh..this is not only addicitive, it gets you going and feeling so good. I use it everyday except on weekends, doing 3 miles on it, and I spend 15 mins on the treadmill only on Saturdays. The boosting? I never thought I could jog before this dvd. Now I am starting to jog even on the treadmill on saturdays! The boosted walking segment has in fact become my favorite segment of each workout. Imagine me, a couch potato enjoying jogging? I now believe things can happen.

What I like about this DVD is the brisk, 12-minute ""miles"" with the optional higher-impact boost at the end.  It's an efficient, safe workout.  I also like Leslie's style -- she's chatty but not chirpy, has a positive, but not pushy approach, and she encourages viewers to be aware of and maintain good postural alignment.  I can see why she is so popular, for while what she is doing technically isn't that novel, it's done in a way that isn't boring and her positive attitude is infectious.",1264550400,5,667,4.487603305785124

Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week. We wouldn't trade her for the world!",1264464000,6,833,4.2784810126582276

I felt so good, so exhilerated! Now I incorporate this DVD atleast once a week, sometimes twice, and do either 3 or 4 miles every other day in between. Since Nov. 2009 I've lost almost 30 lbs using her DVDs and eating right. All of her DVDs really make you sweat, bring up the heart rate, and get you lean. I own about 8 different Leslie DVDs so that I never get bored and I can do different ones each day. Give her a try!!!",1264118400,6,595,3.8852459016393444

3560939,5,B001F12ISU,"I read a review for Leslie Sansone's 3-mile walk video in SELF magazine and thought I would like to try it. I am an active runner 3 days a week but wanted to add cardio on 2 more days without leaving the house. I have never done at-home videos or walking videos before. I read a ton of reviews and finally decided to try the 5-mile walk video instead of the 3-mile walk. I am very impressed with this video!
If you've never tried an at-home exercise video, I would highly recommend this one. Leslie is not very aggravating and she does a great job with cues and explaining what the moves are. I stayed on Mile 1 a couple times because that is where she explains each of the (easy) 4 steps. I'm not coordinated at all so it was nice to do Mile 1 a few times before moving on. What I like best about this video is that I can customize it to my own level. Being new to walking at home I needed something that guided me through the basic moves and Leslie is great at offering alternatives to tone down the level of intensity. She offers low-impact alternatives to the boosted walking and some of the women in the video actually do the lower-impact options so you can see them. Another thing I really like about this video is that I can start with one mile and build until I can do the whole video.",1264032000,,1293,4.176

You need hardly any room to do this, and no equipment to speak of (the DVD and a couple of 2 pound weights). I am almost 70 years old, and can easily do this workout. I have type 2 diabetes, and by doing this DVD, it is under control, and I feel so much better! By the way, I have 5 of her workouts....this one is still my favorite!

I particularly enjoy the boosted walking segments, as they have allowed me to jog for the first time in my 61 years of life.  I have lost 25 pounds with this workout, Qi Gong, and reasonable eating (for me).  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to feel better, improve their stamina, and lose weight.

There are only two things I don't like. The first is sometimes when the music is going to get faster it is silent for awhile when the track is changing. The other is sometimes right when they go into a new move the camera will move up to people's faces or around the studio and you can't see what they are doing. I just found that kind of annoying.

There are a few areas where she jumps in to a move without any warning but as long as you keep on walking - you'll figure it out and also after doing the video several times, I know when she is going to make these moves ahead of time.  I really like Nicki in mile 2 and 3 - she looks so happy and has wonderful posture.

I enjoy using this dvd almost every day.  Every other day, I only do 3 miles and then sometimes 4 or 5 depending on what I have going on.

Worth the price!

Update:  8/30/2016

All muscles in motion - this is what I enjoy about Leslie's walks.

I was on my way out the drive this morning on my bike and I heard the bug sprayer truck (aaahhh!!!)  I turned quickly, parked that bike and rushed in to the house.  I do not want to inhale that chemical so I did the alternative.  Walking in front of the tv.  I have a treadmill but it's boring for me and these walks with Leslie are fun and dang I build up a sweat.

What I like about her walks are you can make them low impact, medium impact or high impact.  You can walk 1/2 a mile which is only 6 minutes - or you can walk 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, etc.  At the end of each mile is a high impact walk/jog.  Starting on the second mile, during the high impact jog/walk - there are only 2 walkers doing the high impact and the others are not ----- so you can choose which level you want to be at.

 Today I did the 5 mile walk.  I do chug a lot of water before during and after these workouts.  I enjoy her inspirational quotes during the workouts.  I appreciate the tips she gives us on the muscles being worked and why you want to suck in the tummy and stand straight, etc.  She likes to reach her hands to heaven during the kickbacks - this just makes you smile and join right in.  Her energy level is contagious.

Well, what I thought was a mere walk in the park included low impact kicks, knee lifts (try kicking at your highest level), light jogging and some other moves. It is still low impact, moderate, but is able to challenge you.  You can do it at any level and add more running like I have at certain points.  In addition to make it even more challenging, I use 3 lbs weights in each hand and switch to resistant bands for a greater challenge.  It is well worth the very reasonable amount and you can choose any distance between 1 - 5 miles.  I love it and Leslie is super fun and engaging.  I feel like I am walking with my girlfriends.

Now I am trying to push myself further.  I got this dvd last week, and the intensity is higher than the previous two that I used.  I am up to four miles now and plan to do all five miles the next time.  I enjoy this because each mile stands on its own.  I also enjoy seeing the different people who participate in each segment.

I'm not really fond of or good at learning extensive routines so the simplicity of Leslie's Walk Away programs appeal to me and I always feel great after any of the walks this one included.  I know now that it makes a great addition to the walking routines I already have.",1256860800,2,590,4.288288288288288
3560953,4,B001F12ISU,"I have been using this for about a month and it is very good.  I am an advanced excerciser 38 yrs old and do weight training, kick boxing as well as running outside usually 4-5 miles.  I use Leslie's videos as sort of a topper to a much harder workout or when I don't want to lift weights and I would say this is good at working up a sweat and burning calories.

I have a few of her videos and like this one the best because:

-She has just the right amount of people on set.  Unlike some of her others  where people feel bunched up.

-I like the fact their are 5 miles which seem to average about 12-13 minute miles, unlike some of her others that can be 15-16, so it is much faster.

-She is not as chatty as in some of her other videos and her focus seems to be really on the excercise.

When she starts her miles off, she uses brisk music and then at about 1/2 a mile the music gets faster which I usuually up the excercise into boosted walking until the end of the mile (just a suggestion to burn more calories).  I also use arm weights to burn a little extra calories.  The first and last mile are Leslie by herself, the 2nd mile seems to be the most energetic of all 5 miles (much younger crowd involved)and the 3rd and 4th mile are good just seems geered to more of a introduction to people on set and less energetic.

This was my first Leslie Sansone video and since bought 5 others which really do not compare to this one.  This was well put together, cueing was good, focus is their with this one.  I just wish her videos could stick with this format and wish Leslie would come out with maybe a 7 mile ""ADVANCED"" walk. Probably something like  walking 1/2mile then boosting for the second 1/2 video for us super advanced walkers.",1256860800,,1740,4.152238805970149

I started working out to Leslie's Videos when she had the 1-2-3 mile series.  I ditched those and bought the 4-mile Express, which I enjoyed.  I've now graduated to the ""5 Mile Fat Burning Walk"" and I am enjoying this one above all others.  As others have posted, the walk is broken down into miles so you can choose to do 1 or 2 or 5 miles.  They're mostly low impact until Leslie gets into ""boost"" mode.  That is my all-time favorite part!  I have to say that by the time I am done with mile 5, I look like I have been working out on weight machines at the gym.  Of course I have to agree with others when they say that this workout fliesssssss by....Leslie tells you when you have done 1/2 mile and before you know it, you're done with the mile you're doing and zipping into the next one.

I won't give up my other workouts (including my Wii Fit) as I NEED variety in my life.  I get bored very easily, but having Leslie to run to when I'm tired of Bob (smile) is a nice thing to have.",1252972800,,1157,4.147982062780269

Before I purchased this dvd along with others I had been on a plateau for a LONG time.  Once I started using her dvd's I finally broke thru.  I really enjoy working with her dvd's simply because I don't dread working out.  With the other dvd's that I have used I got frustrated or tired with them very easily which was due to the fact that they were too intense.

With this dvd it gives you the option as you can probably tell you can do as many miles as you want.  Whether you want to do a mile a day or more.  I try to do four miles a day.  So far I've been using her dvd's for about two weeks every day and haven't regretted purchasing her dvd's.  If you are at the beginning stage of working out or are more into it this dvd will serve both purposes.",1252972800,,871,4.04093567251462

I think it is a great workout for those that want to get in shape without long hours at the gym. Simple and effective.

 It is my first Leslie Sansone's video and my only concern is that I don't know the difference between this video and the others she has, it looks like she is producing many similar videos so I don't know the difference between them. So I am afraid that if I buy others it would be too repetitive.

Leslie: it would help if you prepare more specific video ""samples"" so that your customers know exactly what they are getting in each video and what is the difference.",1252713600,2,847,4.445161290322581

3560964,5,B001F12ISU,"I can honestly say I am a Leslie Sansone veteran exerciser/expert since I own just about every walking video she has ever produced and work out to them often enought to have memorized all the routines.  This is the one workout video I use more than any other for the following reasons .... 1) it's a 5 miler with no breaks, which means I can get in an extra long workout in less time, 2) the jogging intervals means a greater calorie burn, 3) her usual clear cues are easy to follow 4) the music and her pep talk keeps you motivated to keep going without getting bored 5) because this is a walking/jogging workout, you can vary the intensity yourself depending on your own fitness and energy level.

Leslie is my favorite video exercise instructor for so many reasons, but mainly because she's such a likeable person and she makes all her workouts fun and non-intimidating or complicated.  If you know how to walk, perform knee-ups, side step, perform grapevines, kick and jog, than you can do her workouts.

This workout is divided into 5 X 1 mile segments.  From the start menu, you can choose to do the entire workout or pick which mile to start from and go from there.  Each mile ends with a 2 minute jogging interval and if you do the entire workout, you will have completed about 10 minutes of jogging.  Leslie is by herself for miles 1 and 5 and has her walking buddies with her for miles 2 - 4.  It should be noted for those long time Leslie fans, that a familiar face from Leslie's workout video past joins the fun in miles 3 and 4 and that mystery person is Denise, who originally joined Leslie in her 3 Mile Fat Burning workout video that was released sometime around the mid - late 90s.  I recognized her right away!  Sadly, Mary Kay, Joanne, Linda and Carol are not in this video.  I've noticed Leslie has been introducing new walking buddies in her newer videos and she has several newbies in this one too.

Incidentally, because this workout is a super calorie blaster, I have found that by doing this workout often enough, I can have weekend splurges and still maintain my weight.  Another plus!  I hope Leslie will release more 5 milers.  I love them most of all since the 4 milers are getting too easy for me.",1250294400,12,2227,4.424019607843137

I was pleasantly surprised by the challenge of this DVD.  Leslie has added 2-3 more step routines expanding what was offered in the first DVD I purchased.  It was also nice to have the miles crank by at a quicker pace and do the equivalent of 4 miles that was the equivalent of 3 miles on the first DVD I purchased.  In short, the total 5 miles went by quickly.  The music was a lively more up to date disco type music that works well for aerobic even if you wouldn't normally listen to this type of music.

I've been using this DVD 5 days a week starting from May 25th to the present July 3rd and I've lost about 15 pounds also with diet modification (caloric intake of 1200 a day).  I really like Leslie and I get good results from her workouts.  I also own the 2, 3, and 4 mile walks in which I would mix up in order to get a variety of aerobic training, but I've been using this DVD only during the time period stated above.  It is not to severe of a workout and you have the potential to be successful and lose those extra pounds.  It's about 68 minutes from the start until Leslie completes the cool down.

Ms Sansone is welcoming, encouraging and genuinely cheerful. I wake up or return from work looking forward to this workout and not just seeing smiling faces on screen, but smiling along with. One thing I like very much is the emphasis on precision only where it is critical (posture, for example) and not where it is superfluous (which leg you are kicking with). This is a great video for those of us who want to be strong, but have not an ounce of coordination. The only thing I might wish for is to have the cool down as a separate section instead of appended to the end of the 5th mile, but this a small matter.

3560984,5,B001F12ISU,"My friends at work and I LOVE walking with Leslie.  This DVD is great because it has five different one-mile walks on it.  We only walk two miles each day during our lunch break.  This allows us to pick two of the five one-mile walks and therefore provides us with plenty of variety.

The best things about this DVD are that there is no equipment required and each mile takes only about 12 minutes to complete.  We only walk two miles each day, but if we went crazy and decided to walk three miles, it would only take us 36 minutes to do.  Also, there is a two-minute ""Boost"" at the end of each mile, in which you essentially jog.  Since the boost is only two minutes long, it is manageable.

We like that two of the walks (Mile One and Mile Five) are just Leslie by herself.  It is a nice break from Leslie chatting it up with the other walkers.

This is a great DVD.  Don't let the 5 Miles in the title scare you off - you can just walk one mile (or 2, or 3, or 4) and then skip ahead to the cool down and stretching.

I have a number of Leslie's DVD's and wanted a more advanced workout to make me really sweat and burn more calories, and this fit the bill.

She is truly a GOD sent, in the midst of the workout I called my last sister who weighs approx 300 lbs and was enocuraging her to get into it, there is no strain to the body and I just love leslie's spirit.

There were a couple reviews that she talks to much and what not and the music is this and that, to those people I say if you were such great experts why not make your own dvds and leave your negative comments for somebody who really cares geez, cause this woman knows what she's doing and she encourages you to have fun while losing weight.

It's not quite put together as well as some of her other workouts.",1242691200,,721,4.2700729927007295

I have to say that enjoy this workout the last 2 minute boost is a great addition.  1st and 5th mile she does it solo which I like better because I really don't like the girl in yellow or the one who lost all the weight.  She makes this god awful face when she's moving around and the other walks and kicks like she's posing.  I try to not watch them anymore.  I actually turn my back on the tv now and know this by heart that I can move without actually viewing.

3560995,5,B001F12ISU,"The versatility of the 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk has made this one of my favorites from the first time I popped it in.

The workout is 5 12-minute miles with ""Boosted Walking"" in total but it's broken down into 1 mile segments. You can choose the entire 5 miles or choose individual miles.

I've heard some people complain that they don't like ""Boosted Walking"" (which is actually a light jog) and what is awesome about it is, you don't have to do it! You can keep at a low impact walk instead of boosting up but you still get all the benefits of doing the fast 5 miles!

Mile 1 & 5 are with Leslie alone - which I like because she seems to concentrate a lot more on the actual workout than talking - but hey, her talking is what keeps me motivated!

Miles 2, 3, 4 are with a group that changes a little, some new faces (at least for me) which was nice.

Great music - this probably has one of the best tracks of music out of all the DVD's of hers that I have.

My one complaint is that stretching is WAY too short. I like more stretching come the end, like a 5-10 minute stretch but if you are used to Leslie's 2-3 minutes stretches, then no problem! It's got it.

If you like Leslie Sansone, if you like the Walk At Home series and you are past the beginners stages of walking this is a must have!",1242345600,,1297,4.0627450980392155

3561000,5,B001F12ISU,"I really enjoy this DVD.  I feel like you really do get a great workout, and have been steadily losing weight pairing this with a healthier diet.

The miles are all structured in the same manner.  5 minutes brisk walking, 5 minutes power walking, and a two minute jogging boost at the end.  At first I was a little concerned about the fact that you boost at the end of each mile, then drop back down to a brisk walk at the start of the new mile, but I researched a little online and it seems that interval workouts with varying intensity are the most effective for burning fat, so now I'm really happy when I get to drop down to that brisk pace after boosting!

I feel like this DVD is very easy for beginners to follow.  As with any Leslie Sansone DVD, the focus is on moving your body to the music with no complicated steps or combinations.  Another great thing about the DVD is that is works great for any fitness level as you can walk as little as one, or as many as 5 miles during your workout.  Right now I'm walking between 2 and 3 depending on my energy level, but plan to work up to 5 miles eventually.

I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to drop some weight and start a work out routine.",1242000000,,1209,4.199134199134199

The next time you need to work out but don't want to, ask yourself if you have at least 12 minutes. What's nice is that you can break the segments out, like Leslie suggests, do a 12-minute mile in the AM and another in the PM - it's totally worth a try!

It's chaptered and each mile is marked and each mile ends with 2 minute boost (gentle jog).
You can mix up the order however you want to suit your ability, mood, time constraints.
I also like her chatter and interaction with cast.
The music works too.
Miles 1 and 5 are just Leslie. Miles 3,4,5 are variations of the cast. I know this may sound silly but I like that everyone's outfits are coordinated. It makes it less distracting and more professional. I know it's a small thing, but not all her dvd's have this and it's annoying when they are mish mosh.
Uses her basic steps with a little variation--walk in place, kicks, side steps and knee lefts.
This dvd is very good at keeping you in the calorie burning heart rate zone. if it's low, you can always add more upper arm movement to bring your heart rate back up. Serious calorie burner.
HIGHLY recommend this dvd!!",1240444800,,1028,4.444444444444445

I am over 150lbs overweight at the moment and I was having a really hard time finding a workout regime that would keep my heart rate up without complicated moves or painful impacts on my joints.

I was apprehensive trying this one because of its length and the reviews saying it's more for intermediate walkers, but after trying it a couple of times, I can say I love it. I have been able to do the whole 5 miles at a time, keeping my heart rate up without having to concentrate on doing hard routines.

Leslie is really encouraging throughout the video and the music is fun and easy to keep up with. There are only a couple of things that I disliked in the production of this video and that is the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5. First, the music stops at intervals and it's a bit awkward maintaining a pace for those few seconds - I may be picky but it just puts damper on the workout for me. Second, the sound production could have been better as Leslie's claps and screeching of trainers can be heard on the hardwood floor. I suppose that could have been removed from the final piece.

Other than that - really great. I worked up a sweat big time and was able to maintain my elevated heart rate without it being too hard for me to give up on. Really recommend it for those wanting to lose weight!",1240185600,15,1431,4.292592592592593

If you buy only one Leslie Sansone workout, then this is the one to own!  The creator of ""Walk Aerobics"" and my hero, Leslie, has done her best work yet with this one!  I own 80+ of her workouts, and she just gets better and better (and yes, they are all different).  I love this one because the miles FLY by!  12 minute miles are the perfect pace.  You do 10 minutes, and then the last 2 minutes is the ""boosted walking"" - which is really jogging, but if jogging hurts your knees you can just do a fast power walk during that portion.  You can pick and choose your miles, or do all 5!  It begins and ends with just Leslie, and then the miles in between include other walkers.  Leslie always has real-life people, just like you, in her videos - many who are living testimonies of the effectiveness of her programs.

3561010,5,B001F12ISU,"I love Leslie. I have been walking with her since 2002. I started out with her WATP with weighted balls. I now have a ton of her workouts.

I filled out a survey quite awhile back and one day I got a package with 3 of her workouts to try! I probably own at least 30 of her walks so I was pretty excited.

I recently had the chance to try 3 walks that will be sold in Select Target stores starting April 5th. There will be a total of 6 workouts each comes with a booster.

Belly, Buns and Thighs slim down comes with the fit cuffs. It is a 3 mile walk that made me sweat more than some of her other walks.

Walk Off 10 Pounds is a fast 3 mile walk with a 14 day meal plan and a pedometer It has a couple of new moves in it and I did enjoy this walk a lot. Leslie has a segment in this where she cooks a simple breakfast, lunch and dinner.

My favorite one of all is called Punch Up Your Walk. It is a 4 mile walk with weighted gloves. I loved the gloves. I have some of her walks where you hold weights while walking. The gloves velcro onto your hands and around the thumb and stay on without you having to grip them through the walk. There are some new moves in this walk as well. In one you step forward, and punch, it took me a minute to get it but once I did I really enjoyed it.

Last Friday I went to my Target and bought the other 3 workouts in the series. They are amazing. Each walk comes with a Booster like the other 3 and are just as intense.

The 5 Mile Fat Burner comes with 2 stretchies which she uses throughout the walk. Let me just say, 2 stretchies was pretty tough. If you aren't an advanced walker then you should use one at first. This walk wore me out!

Walk Your Way Thin comes with a weighted belt that you wear while you walk. I was impressed with how much it boosted the walks. There are 2, 2 mile walks. One is classic Leslie and the other is a faster pace. I loved both walks but the faster one is my favorite.

The Three Mile Calorie Blast is just that. It comes with a walk belt, I have a couple already but they don't last forever so I was happy about that. It is a solid 3 miler with a few new moves in it. I really felt this in my back and arms the next day. One of the new moves she uses works your back muscles!

One thing that I loved most about these walks is that Leslie is spot on with her cuing. She chats as always but it is encouraging and it actually kept me motivated when I started getting a little tired toward the end of the walks. I have done all the workouts and I did not catch one mistake.

Unfortunately these walks are only at a few hundred Targets nationwide. I am putting a link so you can see if your Target is carrying them. There is a coupon included. [...] I hope that Target puts them on their website at some point so everyone can get them.

I don't write reviews often but these are some of Leslie's best work.",1239148800,10,2872,3.915807560137457

The 12 minute miles go really fast and I love the boost at the end. I have been doing the 3 Mile Advanced and 4 mile Super Challenge and the variations on the moves were exciting and challenging. My only complaint were the walkers. It was so hard to keep my eyes off Britney,she was very distracting. So uncoordinated and bouncing and wiggling all over the place. UGGH. And a couple of the walkers energy levels were very low (it seemed like Leslie just picked them off the street the same day! The faces screamed WHAT AM I GOIND HERE?? I was waiting for Elton or Carol to come in and walk circles around them. But all in all it was a very good work out and I am looking forward to doing it again tonite.

3561018,3,B001F12ISU,"I have been ""walking with Leslie"" for about 8 years now and have several of her videos/dvd's.  Although this is one of my favorites because of the shorter time it takes to walk 5 Miles and the higher calorie burn, I can't help but be disappointed with the format somewhat.  Like I said, the positives are that doing 5 Miles in about 60 minutes is great, and the calorie burn is very high for me.  That I really like!!  What disappoints me is a couple of things.  The first and foremost is the incessant chatter.  I wished she'd given the option of hearing the music only like on her more recent 4 Mile Walk DVD.  I have remedied that somewhat by muting her, and instead listening to my PraiseWalk/PraiseWorkout CD's.  The CD's last about the same amount as the walk and has a warm-up and cool down section.  You can only listen to her repetiveness so much and then it starts to grate on my nerves way too early in the morning! The second thing is that it's obvious that the miles are not done continuously as in one workout.  So with each ""new mile"" that is started, she starts out slower and then picks up speed.  That interrupts the flow if you intend on doing more than 1 Mile at a time.  Since each mile is ended with the 2 minute Boosted Walking, I have to make an extra effort to keep at that pace in order to keep my heart rate up.  I'm doing the entire 5 miles because then I know my workout is done for the day if I want it to be.  I love Leslie but I think she could have formatted this to be better than it is.  But even my disappointment is not enough to stop me from walking with her!  I'll get used to the things I don't like about it and keep at it!",1238716800,157,1664,4.105263157894737

I'm a treadmill or outside-walking kind of girl, and I usually do 5 miles a day, but I don't have a treadmill in my home, nor do I have the space.  And in the winter in northeast Ohio, you have to be crazy to walk outside....so I tried this DVD, and it's awesome!!  It's brisk, it uses more muscles than a regular walk, and it burns tons of calories!!  There aren't a bunch of complicated moves to follow, and Leslie is usually really good about giving cues.  It can be customized for beginners or advanced walkers/joggers.  It'll tone muscles you didn't know you had!!  I loved it so much, I bought 2 more of Leslie's DVDs!",1236556800,,781,4.48936170212766

All her videos are low impact but yet you still get a good workout. After only a mile, it really had my heart beat up. The whole video is fast pace!! I like the way that the first mile is just one or one, you and Leslie, then for 3 miles is with a group (different group each time) and then the last mile is one on one again.

I have to confess that when I played the dvd through (it's always recomended to watch them first before doing them),I thought that it would be a dissapointment as the moves are very basic and the workout looked to very easy to do.
Was I wrong!
The dvd consists of 5, 1 mile workouts that can be done individually or all 5 in 1 go.
The first mile is with Leslie on here own and demonstrates the moves that will be used throughout the 5 miles. Mile 2,3,and 4 are all with a group. Mile 5 and the cool down are again with Leslie alone.
All miles end with a boosted walk which is what Leslie calls it but it really is a jog with jumping kicks,knee lifts. The boosted walk is only 2 minutes but you can really feel your heart pump.
I recomend to do all 5 miles together for a fat burning workout that do get results. Idid this dvd twice this week and have lost 2 kilos already.",1235260800,2,994,4.076530612244898

3561050,4,B001F12ISU,I rate this program as very good. I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was done as 5 separate miles in the workout.

If you need to have people walk with you stick with people like Nicki she is definitely more mature and doesn't look like a geek and want to make you turn it off.

Recently I purchased this DVD and really like the fact that you can do all 5 miles in 63 minutes plus the cool down (12 minute miles)!  You do the usual knee lifts, side steps, kicks, etc. for about the first 10 minutes of each mile.  Then you do ""boosted walking/gentle jogging"" for the last two minutes of each mile.  This is a faster paced walk than some of Leslie's other walks.  Unlike the 5 Day Slim Down, you don't target a particular area of the body on each mile  . . . instead you just do brisk ""walking"" during the whole DVD.

My only complaint is my usual complaint . . . that there are a couple of times Leslie's cuing isn't great.  There is one point where she starts a sidestep by herself . . . because she didn't give the other walkers the cue soon enough.  Also, occasionally she switches lead legs.

I would say that this is geared more for the intermediate walker. . . however, I think you can make it as difficult or easy as you'd like by exaggerating the movements. . . or not.  Leslie has some walkers who don't do the ""boosted walking,"" for those who don't want to jog.

Overall, I'd say I'm quite pleased with this DVD.  I have purchased this and the 5 Day Slim Down for my sister who likes to do indoor walking in the winter. . . so neither of these DVDs can be that bad, right?",1234569600,3,1525,4.713207547169811

You can do one mile a day and work your way up to doing several miles. All you need is a space in front of the tv or computer to walk around a bit.

Being able to easily choose (with your remote control) how many miles to walk is a great idea & makes the workout more fun & versatile.  I like being able to alternate longer & shorter walking days.  Not only are the miles ""marked"", but so are the half-miles (wintin a mile; you can't actually use your remote to choose the half-miles like you can do with the miles). Also, some moves are high-impact, Leslie always encourages the walkers to stay low-impact if necessary.  Either way, it's a good workout! You don't need much workout space, either & the workouts can be short enough for any day.

Highly recommended!",1233273600,,713,4.446153846153846

3561075,5,B001F12ISU,"I love the fast pace on this one!  One thing I like about Leslie is she changes with the times, but doesn't change her basic approach to weight loss and fitness.  In this one, she still sticks with her basics (side-steps, kicks, kick backs, marching in place) but she has added ""boosted"" walking which is the latest in fitness to help boost your calorie burn!  You use every muscle and my shirt is soaking wet when I'm done and I'm an advanced walker! I'm living testimony that Leslie's approach works!  I've lost more than half my body, my resting pulse is 60 (I'm in my 50s), blood pressure is nice and low and I'm in the best shape of my life.  People guess my age to be 15-18 years less than I am.  And I was someone who ""never"" exercised.  Her approach to fitness is not intimating, she doesn't ""yell"" and make you think you're not doing something right.  She always tells you ""you can't do it wrong.  If you keep moving, you're going to get fit.""  I love Leslie!  I will never stop walking this way--I'm addicted now--I exercise every day.  I love the talking too!  Leslie's fun and she's a wonderful person that keeps you motivated and coming back for more.  Some of these fitness instructors are so intimating and their approach to fitness is so overwhelming, that you're more inclined to give up.  Not so with Leslie!!  She's a great personal trainer!  She's always encouraging and she looks and acts like a ""real"" person.  I always buy a new tape to add to my library for the winter to keep me active and keep those pounds from creeping on over winter.  Leslie keeps me fit without having to leave my house.

I love this DVD and after trying a lot of difference exercises I know that this is perfect for anyone who is just starting to lose weight. I couldn't get motivated to do any of the others but this one each mile is so short that you hardly noticed how hard you've worked. It wonderful and it works for anyone who doesn't have time for the typical thirty to forty minute work out. I hope any who wants to start an exercise program starts with this one.

3561080,5,B001F12ISU,"This DVD is truly a wonderful workout. In the dvd, throughout the miles, you have a choice of working out as high impact or low impact. I always do the high impact and after completing the 5 miles, my muscles really feel that I have accomplished something big during the workout. Leslie is so encouraging, and this encouragement really takes your mind off of the natural tiredness your body may start to feel in the 5 mile walk. Although it is called a 5 mile walk, there is about 2 minutes before we complete the mile that we enter into a Boosted Walking phase for people choosing to follow the high impact walkers, and it really is a jog. I honestly believe this workout is wonderful for walkers who may have become bored with the normal low impact dvds. I have a 4 mile walk by Leslie, and because I wasn't getting much sweat or tiredness, I would do it twice in a day, just to feel like I had really worked out. But with this dvd, wow, I would NOT do it twice in a day, because it really works me out. Even by the 3rd mile, I'm thinking, ""Wow, only 3 miles and I'm actually really tired."" I mean really, it is a exciting workout. I believe what makes this walk different as well, is the incorporation of the knee lifts, side steps etc that we are used to, but to a faster pace with more repetitions. Each mile is about 12 minutes each, so we are really going at a fast pace even for the individuals choosing the low impact modifications. I love it!",1231718400,,1452,4.245487364620939

3561082,5,B001F12ISU,"This is my favorite Leslie DVD so far! I love the faster pace. (5 twelve minute miles) I'm hoping she'll come out with a 10min. multi-mile DVD next.  This one is low impact as are all of her workouts, yet very effective.  I'm a huge Leslie fan!  I've maintained my weight for 3 years using only this program.  It's a blessing. I'd recommend it to anyone beginner to advanced.  It does work!",1231632000,,390,4.361111111111111
3561083,5,B001F12ISU,"I have alot of Leslie's Walking DVD's and this is one of my favorites.
Very easy navigation which allows you to quickly customize the workout.
I love the stepped up pace (12 min. miles) which allows you to get a reasonably intense workout in the least amount of time.  If you're short on time an any given day, you can do a 2 mile walk in about 25 minutes.
Don't worry about the boosted walk portion (aka jogging) if a high intensity doesn't work for you.  To get the same boosted intensity, I just do a vigorous stride walk and add 1 lb or 1.5 lb hand weights throughout much of the workout. Keep em coming Leslie... more workouts patterned after this one would be welcomed!",1231632000,,675,4.349206349206349
3561084,3,B001F12ISU,"I purchased this dvd after Christmas.  I had previously been using one of Leslie's walking dvds faithfully for about 3 months and was getting burned out with wanting more variety.  I then purchased this dvd and am pleased with it. I like the fact that you can start at any mile and walk as much as you like and still complete a mile in 12 minutes.  I was disappointed, however, in the music because it is very hard to hear.  You hear Leslie talking but can hardly hear the music in the background.",1231545600,4,497,4.311827956989247
3561085,5,B001F12ISU,"This was an excellent addition to my collection of Leslie Sansone videos! Each mile has it's own ""boost"" so you can do just one mile or all five and get a great workout.  I particularly like the music this is set to...that makes a difference to me as to just how long the workout seems.",1231459200,,286,4.2
3561086,5,B001F12ISU,I have many of Leslie's videos and this is by far the absolute best!  Love the music and the whole set up.  Thanks!,1231286400,,115,3.9565217391304346
3561087,4,B001F12ISU,This is 5 good miles.  My only small notation is that the music for the 2 minute boost at the end of each mile is a little slow for a jog for my knees. But it's easy to keep walking or I can always just jog faster! She does a great job as always and the miles fly by.,1231286400,,267,3.5254237288135593

3561089,5,B001F12ISU,"This Walk Away the Pounds DVD is a tough one.  It is a true 5 mile walk.  The pace is fast and extremely aerobic.  I would definitely say it's advanced.  So if you are new to the WATP's series, take your time doing this one.  It will make you sweat and you will feel the burn after.  GREAT workout DVD.",1231200000,,302,3.95

I would recommend this DVD to others and I did purchase one for my sister.",1230422400,,339,3.857142857142857
3561093,5,B001F12ISU,"I became a fan of Leslie Sansone's workout videos when I was looking for something different to add to my exercise routine.  I love this one of Leslie's for many reasons--the miles are only 12 minutes long each, she ""boosts"" (read: jog) the walking at the end of each mile to get your heart rate pumped, and the music is motivating.  Also, you can do each mile separately, or ""mix and match"" them like I do depending on how much time I have to work out.  My only complaint is that each mile is pretty much like the one before, with no real variation between the miles.

I was never a fan, but I recently purchased a Fitbit and this is great for getting your walks in, when the weather is rainy, or if you would just like the get up and get it done! I can really feel it the next day, and I am very accustomed to gym workouts, a recumbent Bike, elliptical machine; I was truly shocked that I could burn so many calories and walk 5 miles at any given time, or break it up!
