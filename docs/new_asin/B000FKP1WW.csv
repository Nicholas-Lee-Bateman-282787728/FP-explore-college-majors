8124244,5,B000FKP1WW,"WOW! As a big Charles Kuralt fan, this was phenominal. I enjoyed watching it both times, so far. I am sure to watch it again and again, share it with family and especially my children, who were to young to enjoy Sunday mornings with Mr. Kuralt, oh the times they missed.",1267488000,2,270,4.313725490196078
8124245,4,B000FKP1WW,"I have looked in vain for any sort of anthology of the ""On The Road"" vignettes of Charles Kuralt.  This television biography was fine, as far as it went, but I wish CBS, or somebody, would put out a DVD or two with the best of Charles Kuralt.  He was one of my inspirations for a career in broadcast journalism.",1239408000,9,311,4.166666666666667
