7357136,1,B012O29IZE,"Somehow they managed to get 9 or 10 of the worst actors in the galaxy together to spend an afternoon in the hot New Mexico sun putting this on film.  I don't know who in their right mind would look at the final screening of this and say, ""OK. Perfect! Good work everyone!""

On a more positive note, I was terrified by the lead bikers wig.",1444435200,4,338,4.106060606060606

7357139,2,B012O29IZE,"Once you get past all the coincidences, the yeah rights and the unbelievable chain of events that lead us to Boot Heel and just start chomping on popcorn. Then you can settle in and enjoy this movie. It's not a very intelligent film but it's semi-entertaining and fun. You do hate all the characters which is a bit of a bummer. I couldn't even root for the girl with the gigantic jugs, Marcelle Bowman. They're all just a bunch of whiny turds. You really hate everyone except the masked marauders of Boot Hell. The pacing is the best part of the movie and the hilarity that everybody punches in slow motion, it's hysterical. Plus you get the emotional music when they die and you just lyao. Worst actors ever. I suppose the film is suppose to be tongue in cheek but it just doesn't really work. Speaking of tongues, one guy does get his cut out though which is kinda rad. The ending really sucks and this movie did too. Lionsgate is slowly turning into Lionshate. Because almost all of their stuff in 2015 is horrible. Who is buying their content for distribution? They need to be killed by the Boot Heel Bandits.",1444089600,,1113,4.487684729064039

7357173,1,B012O29IZE,"The main characters in this movie don't eat, they suck. As in this movie is such a total waste of time it sucks. Im sorry to be so harsh but this movie was so bad that even trying to watch portions of it in fast forward, through those scenes where no dialogue is spoken and nothing happens (which was much of the time) were too bad to watch even that way.

A group of five friends (every one of which is a terrible actor whose names I won't print to avoid embarrassment for them) are on a trip when they stop at a rest area in the desert. Also at the stop is one of the worst excuses for a biker gang ever filmed. When one of the girls goes missing from the restroom they immediately assume the now gone bike gang took her and set out to get her back.

It turns out the gang didn't take her and thats when they realize there was another car at the stop. They backtrack (after leaving the bikers stranded of course) and eventually find the car and the group that took her. The members of this group where white cloth bags on their heads with Xs scrawled where there eyes are. Ooooooscary!

I really want to tell you what lame excuse for a bad guy this group is but someone would yell spoiler and be unhappy. Trust me, please TRUST ME, when I say that renting this movie to find out is not worth it. Poorly made, uninteresting, pacing that seems slow when placed beside a snail and with some of the worst acting Ive seen in years. There is nothing I can think of to say good about this movie. Yes, I know that many who work on movies have a love of film and a desire to be creative. But Im sorry this one was really bad.",1445904000,2,1618,4.081761006289308

7357179,2,B012O29IZE,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW

The film takes place June 26, 1976 as five people drive a Mustang across the desert with an AM push button radio and no 8-Track. Jill (Hannah Risinger) goes missing at a rest stop and the remaining group confront some ""Demon"" bikers and then they all (almost) get eaten by cannibals who wear derbies and pillow cases over the heads for reasons that were never explained.

Painfully bad plot. One scene showed a bunch of guts which was about half the film's budget. Writing wasn't that good. They could have done a lot of simple things to have made the plot better. Should be part of a multi-pack in no time.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1444694400,2,662,4.5

8726300,3,B012O29IZE,"I could understand negative reviews but I liked it. Sure, it's no-name actors, a basic one-location setting, and a rather tried & true plot -- cannibalistic mutants in the ghost town desert. But the filmmakers did try to create an original family of villains, and the cinematography is solid. The story is simple but maintains tension due to the protagonists having to worry not only about the cannibals, but a biker gang, too. It sounds silly but it's almost plausible. Again, the real star of the show is the director of photography and the way many scenes were filmed at the magic hour in the desert. Very beautiful. On a drive from California to the east coast a few years ago, I remember going thru New Mexico and noticing how many ruins of towns or stand-alone structures there were, which had a kind of creepy beauty. That sort of thing is almost a character itself in this film.

On the downside, the pacing is off and the actors' timing is very strange. That plagues the whole film. I also didn't quite get what the shambling old doctor man mutant was supposed to be doing to the missing girl. The story is set in summer, 1976 or 1974, and I'm not sure why this was done, as it could have just as easily been the present day. A character has a ""FTW"" tattoo, which struck me as anachronistic, as I don't think that phrase was around in the 1970s. I think the filmmakers were going for a Hills Have Eyes/Rob Zombie type of retro thing, but did not put enough historical detail into the production or characters to make this effective. With a larger budget and more detail in the production this could have added a layer to the film. A lead actress resembled a cross of Maggie Gyllenhall and a turtle, and from the opening moments I didn't know if I could watch a whole movie with her, but she had a nice ample bosom and ended up being okay.

The filmmakers showed restraint on gore and some of the lazy, cheesy jump scare moment temptations, which I appreciated. It's not a great film but for what must have been a micro-budget, I think they did a lot more than other films of similar ilk.",1530835200,,2096,4.441558441558442
