They only do that because they are educated beyond their intelligence and can't think of anything else better to say.  I mean really girls, get over yourselves. How is this hurting them? Acknowledge this for what it is; a really fine document of a time when human expression triumphed over the powers that be, or think they be. I'm a firm believer in Napoleanic reality; quit indulging in your own myths at the cost of losing it all. Don't march the troops into Russia without winter clothes on a caprice. Don't fire all your gay employees because you think it will attract right wing money. Believe me, The God of Money don't care one way or the other. The apple tree grows for the snake as well as for the humans. Magnus Hirschfeld should be celebrated as a hero. I dare Hollywood to do a remake of this one. Brad Pitt are you listening?

7971213,4,B00006L97H,"Magnus Hirschfeld may not be a name well known in the U.S., but his studies and institute in Berlin advanced the gay movement as much as the Stonewall riots - and this was in 1943.
This biopic of a great man is very well done by director Rosa Von Praunheim.  The DVD offers a documentary in addition to the film and an interview with Von Praunheim.
The film is in German, with English subtitles.  There is quite a bit of male frontal nudity, but this is far from a pornographic film.  It is a very well researched, well done biography of the man who coined the term - transvestite.
Definitely recommend this film for anyone's library.  It is an important record of our gay history",1043020800,4,680,4.416
