8135079,4,1589500113,"The video does address traditional male and female socialization in its coverage of the topic. Although I, too, am not comfortable with the ""boxes"" society puts us in, I recognize how valuable it is to be aware of traditional gender socialization and how it can impact our ability to communicate.

Straight from the text on the screen, this is the ""Advice for Men"" that is included:

1. Realize that rape is a crime that can occur whether you know the person or not.

2. It's not acceptable to force another individual to have sex with you, even if the two of you have had sex before.

3. Communication is critical.

4. A woman's desire for closeness or affection doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to have sex with you.

5. A rejection of sex is not a rejection of you.

6. Do not use intimidation or force of any kind.

7. A date who is intoxicated is not in any condition to consent to have sex.",1409702400,,903,4.397590361445783
8135080,1,1589500113,"From the tape's own description: ""This program explains how a failure to communicate effectively is at the heart of many date rape situations. Young women can learn how to reduce their chances of being victims of date rape and young men can learn how to avoid accusations of date rape.""

NONSENSE! This video presents rape as a big misunderstanding, a sort of relationship ""oops"" during sex. It implies that it is up to women to prevent themselves from being raped, and that a male's role is to learn how to avoid being accused of raped.

Rape, in fact, is not a ""misunderstanding"" or a ""communication problem."" It is a vicious, life-changing trauma that happens when one person CHOOSES to exert power and control over another in a criminal assault. I would feel very uncomfortable suggesting to teens that rape is a misunderstanding at its core, and the WORST way to address rape is by teaching young men how to AVOID responsibility (accusation) while teaching young women to simply communicate better as a ""risk reduction"" skill.

For what it's worth, I'm a male and I find myself shocked by the low expectations this film places on males, and the utter irresponsibility of the film to approach male sexuality with a ""how to not be accused"" perspective, rasther than a ""how to be responsible with your strength in relationships"" perspective.",1108771200,7,1343,4.881578947368421
