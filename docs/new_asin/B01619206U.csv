Nice Photoshoot of the Box set.",1455840000,37,178,4.264705882352941

7455217,5,B01619206U,"TITLE : Sabrina, the Teenage Witch
SEASON'S : One - Seven (Complete Series)
NUMBER OF DISC: 24
EPISODE'S :: 162
PACKAGING : One Jumbo Case (Hold's 24 Disc with Removable Tray)

Here it is for the first time (And probally won't be the last) Sabrina The Teenage Witch - The Complete Series (Region 1). We have had Melissa Joan Hart as the perk witch on dvd before this in seperate set's so the real question remained why they didn't just transfer the dvd's to a complete series before now is beyond me. All 162 are spread over 24 disc that resemble previous set's and ongoing releases useing a jumbo cases with a removable tray. Each disc has it's own hub and not in a paper sleeve (The Sleeves stopped me from buying certain set's) and makes the set even more durable when in hand. There are a couple downfalls with this type of packageing and that's if it breaks it will take some serious hunting to get the replacement parts, just a minor drawback in these amazing set's that cut the cost and not the value.

In the end if you own the individual season's pass this (disc are identical), if you don't own any or just 1 or 2 then go for it. It's a terrific show, in great packageing at a low price.",1455753600,40,1197,4.315555555555555

The product is no different then the other box set and just like that other box set the music has been changed in almost every episode and scenes have been deleted that were relevant to the plot and episodes.

Save your money people you can easily find this show online with all music and scenes intact.

Just like the other box set these companies prove they show no are at all for the fans .

7455266,5,B01619206U,I love this set! I've seen some complaints about the casing of the DVD's and it's unimportant as long as the discs are protected I think. I buy DVD's for the show not the casing. The show is wonderful and it's funny to see how many different cats they used for Salem when there was a real cat in the scene. Great price for the whole set,1499126400,2,336,4.029850746268656

7455312,5,B01619206U,i am of generation of TGIF a fun show about a teen witch that is learning about her life as a witch which she has to hide from her non -witch /warlock friends and going to teenager stuff. The whole cast is fun with Sabrina and her aunts Zelda and Hilda and Salem the familiar cat among the other actors. Very easy one of the most fun / memorable shows of the 90's,1483315200,,363,3.9863013698630136

7455337,5,B01619206U,Love this show! Price is almost half another version of this Same Set; just the packaging is different. This container isn't my favorite but the price is worth it. So far I'm on season 3 and each disc is playing perfectly. I do now understand what another reviewer meant when they said the section that holds all this discs is separate from the outside of the case. It's a plastic shell unattached to the flipping pieces that hold discs (these are all attached to each other).,1471910400,,476,4.546511627906977

Season 1
Meet Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) as she discovers that she is a witch on her 16th birthday.  Hello to aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick), talking cat Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay), Sabrina's best friend Jenny (Michelle Beaudoin), arch-rival Libby (Jenna Leigh Green), boyfriend Harvey (Nate Richert) and teacher Mr Pool (Paul Feig).  Stories swirl around Sabrina experimenting with her new powers, exploring the Other Realm and the trials of starting school at Westbridge High.

Season 2
Goodbye to Jenny (and hello to Sabrina's new bestie Valerie, played by Lindsay Sloane).  Mr Pool is replaced by Mrs Quick (Mary Gross).  Vice-Principal Kraft (Martin Mull) becomes Sabrina's biggest nemesis. Sabrina must study for her Witches' License and is visited throughout the season by her Quizmaster (Alimi Ballard).  Sabrina also gets another would-be boyfriend in Dashiell (Donald Faison).

Season 3
Sabrina's new task is to uncover the mysterious Family Secret.  Relatives visit throughout the season giving her clues on what it could be.  Kraft starts dating Zelda and it's revealed that he used to be married to a witch.  Sabrina battles a pancake addiction and flies a mini-spaceship into Libby's nose.

Season 4
Goodbye to Valerie and Libby.  Hello to Dreama (an apprentice witch who Sabrina must mentor, played by China Shavers), along with Harvey's friend Brad (Jon Huertas), who turns out to be a witch-hunter.  Hilda buys a Clock Shop and Kraft is promoted to Principal.  Sabrina develops a crush on new guy Josh (David Lascher).

Season 5
Goodbye Westbridge High, hello John Adams College.  Sabrina and Harvey come to a parting of the ways.  New friends Roxie (Soleil Moon Frye), Morgan (Elisa Donovan) and Miles (Trevor Lissauer) come onboard.  Zelda becomes a college professor and Hilda takes over the campus coffee shop.

Season 6
College life continues.  Sabrina's relationship with Josh escalates.  Harvey returns and begins to date Morgan.  Hilda finds love and gets married.

Season 7
Goodbye to Hilda and Zelda, as well as Josh and Miles.  College is over and Sabrina returns to the mansion, with Roxie and Morgan as housemates.  Sabrina lands a journalist job at the music magazine ""Scorch"".  Sabrina meets the handsome Aaron (Dylan Neal) and wedding bells are in the air... or are they?
