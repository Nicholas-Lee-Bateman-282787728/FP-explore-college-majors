8088536,5,B000BKVKZ8,"Would you like to own 36 of the best westerns ever made? Would you like to own some of the rarest movies available on dvd? Then you will want to buy this superb collection of movies.
Tell you how much I liked the collection, I purchased 3 to give as Christmas presents for family... enough said.
You get some of John Wayne's earliest movies, & you get movies starring Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Lee Van Cleef, Randolf Scott, and Dennis Hopper.
You get 10cent westerns, now on dvd, and you get action on top of action on top of action, need I say more?
What I really love about the collection is the fact that I've seen actors in roles I'd never seen them play in in later years. Remember Gaby Hayes, the old guy with the beard and no teeth who was always a crabby old gent? How about seeing him as a well dressed, gun toating outlaw?
Or how about John Wayne WATERSLIDING!!!, better yet, John Wayne singing and playing guitar?
You'll get to see it all on these beautiful dvds. Each dvd is individually placed in its own sleeve (8 in all), with movie details below each dvd. On the back cover of the case is a list of the movie titles along with year of release and running time.
Some of the movies are for the whole family to enjoy, and 2 have nudity.
You will get 4 Randolf Scott movies - RAGE AT DAWN, THE FIGHTING WESTERNER, ABILENE TOWN, and TO THE LAST MAN.
You will get 4 Lee Van Cleef movies - GOD'S GUN, BEYOND THE LAW, DEATH RIDES A HORSE and THE GRAND DUEL.
You get 11 John Wayne movies from the 1930's!!! - BLUE STEEL, THE DAWN RIDER, THE LAWLESS FRONTIER, THE LUCKY TEXAN, NEATH ARIZONA SKIES, RANDY RIDES ALONE, THE STAR PACKER, ANGEL AND THE BADMAN, HELL TOWN, THE DESERT TRAIL, and THE MAN FROM UTAH.
You also get 4 Gene Autry classics - RIDERS OF THE WHISTLING PINES, THE BIG SHOW, SPRINGTIME IN THE ROCKIES, and BOOTS AND SADDLES.
4 Roy Rogers movies - KING OF THE COWBOYS, MY PAL TRIGGER, SONG OF TEXAS, UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS, and UTAH.
Plus 8 other superb films - ANY GUN CAN PLAY, SHE CAME TO THE VALLEY, NORTHWEST TRAIL, THE NAKED HILLS, MOHAWK, TULSA, FAIR PLAY, and THE YOUNG LAND.
If you purchased each title seperately, you would spend much much much more money.
Please note that on the John Wayne movies the sound isn't the best, (you'll have to turn up the volume) but overall, the movies are spectacular. They all have good stories to them, and I have watched several of the movies more than 3 times.
Of course most of the movies on here are from the 1930's and 1940's, thus are in Black and White, but for the most part are easy to view.
If you want hours of action, drama, suspense, thrills, and overall good Western movie excitement, you'll want to own this excellent collection. Enjoy it yourself or give as a gift. The package looks like leather but is actually tough cardboard, and is in the form of a booklet.
Also note that several of the movies are some of the best Spaghetti Westerns ever made!!!",1257638400,,2931,4.340619307832423
8088537,5,B000BKVKZ8,"For several years at WalMart discs by Platinum Disc Corporation could be found under the title ""Great American Western"", and eventually there must have been at least 30 sets available.  Later a set of 5 collections known as ""Legends of the West"" incorporated most or all of movies in the Great American Western series.  So if anyone bought any of the Great American Western materials it is probably collected in the later sets known as Legends of the West.  While it may true most of this material is in the 'public domain' it is not readily available at command when the viewer might want to see it.  And someone such as myself, sick and tired of paying high cable bills, who are without cable these sets are a real boon.  Owning these movies solves that problem, a viewer can watch them when desired and rewatch them as desired.

This Volume One essentially does just that, and if a buyer would collect all 5 volumes it would seem he/she would have all the Platinum material available, other than a few special sets and the 8 DVDs of the Hopalong Cassidy series.  Each of the DVDs have been digitally mastered, with scene index, and interactive menus. At least that is what it says on the box, but most of movies I've watched are technically good and the Hopalong Cassidy series is especially noteworthy for its clarity.

This LEGENDS OF THE WEST-Volume 1 has 36 features and over 43 hours of digitally enhanced audio 5.1 and is digitally remastered.  For my taste not all the movies included are to my taste, yet even those few can introduce viewers to movies they might not see elsewhere.  Another added attraction to LEGENDS OF THE WEST series in total is the half dozen of so documentaries on Cowboys, Gunfighter, Indians, and just the 'real' west in general spread over the 5 sets.  Back in 2005 I purchased all 5 sets and have never regreted doing so.

If you are a western fan, these sets may be of some interest to you.

8088538,4,B000BKVKZ8,"Platinum Disk's Legends of the West (Volume 1) almost exclusively includes public domain films that can be found in other such sets.  If you've already amassed a collection of these films, it's unlikely you'll see much new here (although I've never seen ""The Young Land"" starring a very young Patrick Wayne and Yvonne Craig).  What this set has going for it is the cost (list price $9.99) and the fact that many of the prints are a cut above what you'll usually find in boxed sets of public domain films.  For example, the print used for ""Rage at Dawn"" is far superior to the one recently shown on the Westerns Channel.

There are a couple of negatives:  One, and it's a small one, is the binding - the 8 discs are arranged in an photo album-like cardboard contraption with the spine curved as if it were a book.  Since the container is so flimsy, the spine on my set was somewhat crushed in shipment - and, frankly, I don't see how it wouldn't be. I don't believe the contraption will stand up to a lot of wear-and-tear, either.

A more significant drawback is the number of films presented in their edited-to-fit-into-a-hour-long-TV-time-slot-with-commercials version.  I've noted those on the summary list below.
