2735433,4,B000MGUZAM,"Knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting, directing and acting. And it's nice to see when a director/script get it right. Clocking in at just 82 minutes, 10 ITEMS OR LESS doesn't stretch the story, trying to grasp at inane topics. It stays focused, being funny, sad, and well thought out.

Morgan Freeman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucky-Number-Slevin/dp/B000FKO5QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucky Number Slevin</a>) stars as ""Him"", an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him. We're introduced to ""Him"" as he travels to a supermarket in an out-of-the-way section of town by The Kid (Jonah Hill,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Click/dp/B000HT386M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Click</a>). Realizing he has a star in his car, The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years. Him isn't very forthcoming because, not only has he been out of it for while, he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in (""I haven't decided if I'm going to accept the part.""). The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville. Stuck, Him decides to check out the local market. He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet (Paz Vega,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spanglish/dp/B0007OCG56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spanglish</a>) who operates the 10 items or less register. Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent, Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role. He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.

But Him doesn't just use Scarlet, he helps her so he can see deeper into her life. They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband, and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for, and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing. This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him, too, showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world (""These shirts are only $12 bucks! How is this possible?!"")

The ending, as stated at the beginning of this review, is abrupt but apropos. There's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond. They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other. It's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside Him's L.A. mansion.

This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going. And it won't waste your time either.",1182556800,24,2783,5.34703196347032

3. Unpretentious Morgan Freeman

4. The car wash scene

5. Live your dreams

7. Did I mention Paz Vega is hot?

2735436,5,B000MGUZAM,"This movie proves you don't always have to spend millions of dollars and 6 months to a year to churn out the world's greatest epic. In the case of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Items-or-Less/dp/B000MGUZAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Items or Less</a>&nbsp;the movie was filmed in 15 days. The locations were Carson and Brentwood, CA. And a good deal of the story takes place in Archie's Ranch Market, Target, and a car wash. And this is one of the best films to come along - well - in a long time!

Morgan Freeman portrays a nameless (but very recognizable) actor who hasn't worked in four years. He's considering a part, as a store manager, for an independent film. Feeling the need to research this part before committing to the role, Freeman's character is dropped off at a Carson grocery market. And this is where he meets the ""10 Items or Less"" checkout girl, Scarlet Morales, played by the incomparable Paz Vega. They wind up spending a serendipitous day together. Their lives couldn't be more different, but they share a congruity. Both are somewhat trapped by their own intertia. The actor hasn't stepped beyond Brentwood in a long while and Scarlet hasn't stepped out of Carson.

Freeman's character is stranded with no cash - just a Diner's Club card (Thank you, Diner's Club). He can't remember his own phone number. Scarlet is the sharp, practical and pragmatic one and once she retrieves her Gremlin from estranged husband/store manager, they are in business.

What makes this movie amazing is the bond that forms between the actor and Scarlet. She has an job interview scheduled later that day. The actor puts his desire to get home on hold to help Scarlet prepare for the ""audition.""

It's worth the price of admission when you come to the scene in Target. The actor has never stepped foot into a discount department store. His first comment is ""This is amazing."" Scarlet responds sardonically, ""It's Target.""

The carwash scene is the next gem-he decides Scarlet's Gremlin needs some spiffing up before she pulls up for the interview. Whether it's the carwash, Target, or even Arby's, Freeman's character has a wonderful way of engaging people and Scarlet adds that sense of grounded reality. Each learn something from the other.

Another scene to watch for involves Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman near the end of the movie.

The soundtrack (which unfortunately is not available) is kick-butt to say the least. You find yourself humming it in your head long after the DVD has been put away.",1179100800,10,2555,5.069047619047619
2735437,4,B000MGUZAM,I became totally engrossed in this film.  This is a simple movie with a story line over one day.  It is about two people who underestimate their job skills and themselves. They learn a lot from each other about their capabilities.,1178150400,6,230,4.585365853658536
2735438,5,B000MGUZAM,"If you want to laugh, think hard, grin and maybe look at life differently, enjoy this film.  You can't help but thoroughly be engrossed in it.",1178064000,14,142,4.461538461538462
2735439,4,B000MGUZAM,"10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word.  Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.

Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things.  His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere.  The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.

It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well.  This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message.  It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view. Grady Harp, April 07",1177804800,12,1681,4.528052805280528
2735440,2,B000MGUZAM,This has got to be one of the worst film Morgan Freeman has ever made. I am not sure what he or the director was thinking?

2735482,5,B000MGUZAM,"A decidedly large departure from the special effects, car chase, bullet riddled scenes the majority of todays films seem compelled to include. This film sticks to the basics: While telling a story, let the actors breathe life into the characters to such a degree the audience enjoys the experience. The ACTORS must do it because its only them and the story's ""plot"".

The plot? It's about an aging, out of work actor that takes an interest in and helps out a young girl cashier as she struggles to get a better job and a better life. Ho-hum. But that's where the actor's abilities count. Turn something ""Ho-hum"" into an unexpected pleasure.

As I watched the movie, I began to feel Morgan Freeman (playing the aging actor) was quite enjoying the whole thing, not just playing a part. At the end of the movie you get to see what goes on at ""non-working"" times. You might be interested to see him learning the ""proper"" way to sell cleaning supplies (with a free mop!) all the while getting prompts, reminders, and corrections from the woman working at the store visited in the movie.",1349913600,,1081,4.654450261780105

2735486,5,B000MGUZAM,Morgan Freeman can play all kinds of characters including comedy.  This is such a sweet story of two strangers who are so different but begin to understand eachother so quickly.

2735487,5,B000MGUZAM,"You can tell this was a fun diversion movie for Morgan Freeman. Yes, it's a fairly unlikely story, but who doesn't want a little lighthearted humorous entertainment once in awhile.

I was able to stomach this one to the end (as opposed to The Amateurs).
Shot on seemingly poor quality videotape the actors sleep-walk through the ""script"". An interesting idea for a film if the producers would've paid for a good scriptwriter, but they didn't. Yawn. Let me know when Paz Vega learns how to speak English - she looks great but she has such a thick Spanish accent that I cannot understand her when she speaks English - maybe subtitles would help.
Again - avoid all films produced by First Look Pictures. You can tell these films by the cheap graphics at the very beginning. Maybe these are films made by film school students where the name actors donate their time for tax deductions.",1266364800,,783,4.640287769784172
2735489,1,B000MGUZAM,"When the movie starts with someone dropping the F bomb in every sentence when it's not even in a valid context, it tells me that we have an ignorant A) character, B) actor, and C) DIRECTOR.  They're nothing but sell-outs and propagating vulgarity in an unnecessary context.  I'll make a point not to watch this directors movies.

Even sadder is Morgan Freeman...you'd think he'd have more class or principles to put his foot down and not be a part of certain projects.  Guess it's all about making a buck.",1258243200,,505,4.640449438202247
2735490,4,B000MGUZAM,"After passing this film up many times on cable I finally just let it play when it came on and, wow, was I surprised. Sure, this is no slice of reality, but it is a sweet reflection of what may happen once in a while. Morgan Freeman plays his charming self and I hope to see Paz Vega in more films. A couple of other things: this was made really and truly on location. LA is filmed in LA. Brentwood is filmed in Brentwood. Carson is really Carson. For once filmmakers do not assume that no one from the place in question is ever going to see their movie. I'm a Morgan Freeman fan to start with, but after this like him even more.",1252022400,2,628,4.07258064516129
2735501,5,B000MGUZAM,"Morgan Freeman stars in this lightweight, very pleasant vehicle. Freeman is referred to as ""Him"" in the script. No, this is not a parody of the recent political campaign. It is the story of an out-of-work, but still famous, actor dropped off by an airhead driver at a neighborhood grocery in the midst of Carson, California, which looks like an run down town, to research a role in a potential independent film. Freeman is in a slough of self-doubt and despair. When he sees copies of his old movies being heavily discounted on DVD, he buries them deep in the display.

 He meets Paz Vega, who mans - er, womans - the ""10 Items Or Less"" lane. She is brash, angry, frustrated, wrapped up in a lousy marriage where her husband's lover works in the same store, is convinced that life is a dead end.

 Freeman and Vega form an unlikely alliance. He has no way to find his way back home to Brentwood - a highly unlikely experience - and she has to go to an interview that she is convinced will get her nowhere.

 Thus begins a series of light adventure in which both Freeman and Vega expand their horizons.

 This is a fun, light film. Freeman is Freeman playing Freeman and, unsurprisingly, he does it quite well. He waltzes through his scenes with an appealing lightness. Vega works hard as the bitter woman looking for a better life, while she is sure that she is not entitled to anything more than life in the ""10 items or less"" lane.

 The ending is pleasing. The whole film is pleasing.

 No great revelations here. Just a nice, pleasant film.

A good scriptwriter could have done something with the idea and given the characters something interesting to do and say. My advice: rent it before you buy it.",1239753600,3,330,4.253968253968254
2735503,2,B000MGUZAM,"A rambling movie without a point (except for gather thee roses, dully stated) and long scenes of watching people check out, make pay phone calls, ride down rodes.  A few mildly cute scenes save it from the dust bin of 1 star reviews, and of course Morgan's presence always adds a bit of gaiety.  I've yet to see Paz Vega act.  As usual she just stands around as a Hispanic stereotype.  Dreadful movie with zero chemistry besides Morgan's coy smile.",1231545600,3,448,4.5625
2735504,5,B000MGUZAM,"Scarlet is a young woman who has no faith in herself and her abilitities. She feels completely alienated from bettering herself. She's been a checker for 6 years, no upwardly mobile prospects,and  as she says, ""never had a job where I could sit down.""

In the wealthier parts of town, where Scarlet visibly feels completely out of place,and walking to the enormous, intimidating ""temple"" building of the construction receptionist job, you know she'd have cut and run if ""Him"" wasn't there to give her moral courage. He stands behind her just for that reason, that she can't turn and chicken out.

Morgan Freeman is excellent as usual. He knows when to tone down his acting just as he gets a little too close to mugging and being full of himself, but aren't all actors full of themselves? He can afford to be what with his phenomenal talent and success. He looks like he'd just be a blast to hang out with! And in his early 70's, he looks 53-54 years old, tops! He doesn't have the old person mentality; he's still full of life in his later years. We can never get enough of Morgan.

The only problem with this movie was the sexual innuendos towards Scarlet. You could see her face sag when Him brought up the subject, like she thought Him liked her for her, but he's kind of crossing the line to see how she reacts to talk of sex. All women have been here. It can hurt our feelings when it appears all a man wants from us is sex, not friendship. I got a little uncomfortably squirmy like Scarlet.

That aside, when Scarlet walks out of the interview,shoulders straight and confident,  she is visibly a different person, having done what terrified her beyond belief. We don't know if she got that job, but we know she'll go somewhere else and do it again until she succeeds. That's the invaluable gift Him's character. Her gift to Him is that even though he's a long faded star,seeing the struggles of the lower working class, he realizes he has a whole lot more to be grateful for than he thought.

The wonderful music score features an infectious Latin cha-cha-cha piece that will stick in your brain for days! Loved the carwash scene!!

Silberling is a wonderful comic director, so subtle, yet his sight gags make you laugh out loud. Nothing over the top stupid and juvenile as we see so much of anymore. His approach to comedy has more of an understated European flair than the pathetic American style. Make more comedies, Mr. Silberling!

So far I've probably watched this little gem 10 times!

2735505,1,B000MGUZAM,"It's funny when you see an actor, Morgan Freeman, playing himself.  You really get to find out how uninteresting a person he really is.  If it's being condescending in Target, as though he's in some heavenly dimension, or if it  is Morgan simply repeating everything ""Scarlett"" says, as though we didn't hear it the first time.  Or it somehow means more to the audience when Freeman repeats it?....GREAT DIALOGUE!!!  Freeman helped produce this garbage.

Paz Vega is alright, at least she is semi-interesting; in terms of what she has to say.  But Morgan comes off as a  creep in this film with his sexual innuendos and constant staring at ""Scarlett"" ,and basically his ""trying to get her to invite him somewhere"" type of attitude.  Whether it's persistently paying her compliments or conveniently forgetting his own phone number, and constantly bringing up his own forgetfulness throughout the film; as though we're supposed to feel sorry for him?  Come on.

Horrible Movie!  The only thing that kept me watching was to see how ridiculous, creepy, pretentious and aware of himself, this ""accomplished"" actor could get.  ""Tell me ten things you enjoy""  PLLLLLLEEEEEEAAAAASSSSSEEEE.  He reminds me of a cab driver I worked with.  No social skills and a grade 8 education.  This movie actually made me mad.

He's doing research for an upcoming film project and starts off at a small grocery store (Jonah Hill - ""The Kid"" drops him off in his van) where he meets Paz Vega (Scarlet); who is beautifully cast as the disgruntled checker of a small grocery store.

She reluctantly gives Freeman a ride home as she leaves work; because he forgot his phone number for his ride and ""The Kid"" fails to return to pick him up. They both end up on a days journey to an ex-husband's trailer park, a K-Mart, a fast-food restaurant, car wash, and eventually to her interview at a construction company for a job as a secretary (the scene between Freeman and the receptionist is hilarious).

Freeman's behavior and interaction with other people and Scarlet is ethereal and esoteric, while Scarlet is quick-witted, smart-mouthed and down-to-earth. What a great pairing of actors. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman appear in a short but funny cameo towards the end.",1220832000,,1037,4.718232044198895

Scarlet (Vega) is the 10 items or less aisle checker.  She's running the market while the manager and his new girlfriend (Scarlet is his ex) are messing around.

When Freeman's ride home doesn't show up, Scarlet takes him home on her way to a job interview.  In helping to fix her up, Freeman regains his own confidence.

But what could be called the music video (or utopian vision) at the film's heart is so wonderful it's worth the price of admission, especially with the video currently selling for a penny (plus S&H) on Amazon.  Feels like Freeman had this recurring fantasy of what he'd do if he could just do what he wanted, and it's all over this very loving movie.",1196726400,,528,4.43298969072165
2735522,4,B000MGUZAM,"This rather short movie is a delightful watch, though I would've liked to have seen more of the characters.  Morgan Freeman plays an actor who hasn't played in a movie for a while and is 'researching' a possible role in an Indie film when he runs into a young girl in the 'ten items or less' lane in a grocery store. Vega's character has lots of spunk, but faltering confidence that she can strive to be more.  I love the banter between Paz Vega and Freeman, as well as the other unique characters.

2735523,1,B000MGUZAM,I love Morgan Freeman in just about any movie but this one was all shaking camera and idiotic dialog.,1192492800,5,101,4.368421052631579
2735524,3,B000MGUZAM,"There's no real plot to this film. It's all about two people whose lives briefly touch and who make a touching, unlikely connection.

There are a few too many quirks ladled into these characters' behavior to make them truly believable. Morgan Freeman plays an actor whose career is lagging and who therefore has agreed to star in the very indie film of a Hollywood newcomer. Freeman is chauffeured out to the limbo of a grocery store set in an improbably desolate industrial parking lot area, so that he can study a real store manager in preparation for his movie role. It's hard to imagine that any actor, however flagging his career, would take the time to venture off on such a goofy course of study.

Then Freeman is given the odd habit of clutching at the napes of passersby in order to sneak a peek at their clothing labels and check them for fabric content. Who does that? That is a bizarre eccentricity that the scriptwriters truly dragged in by the mohair.

There is also something rather unconvincing about the behavior of the young check-out clerk whom Freeman befriends. She moves from being a sullen, skeptical girl with a chaotic personal life, to being an open, heartfelt woman of calm philosophy. That sort of quick transformation is hardly believable.

Still, there is something appealing about this movie. You don't get many films that feature people getting to know each other fondly just by talking. This is no ""Dinner With Andre,"" but if you enjoyed that movie showing two people weaving themselves together with zigzag stitches of conversation - then you will like this film.",1192233600,,1597,4.817518248175182
2735525,4,B000MGUZAM,"This is a little movie that goes nowhere at a moderate pace.

Morgan Freeman plays an actor like Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega is a ranch market check-out cashier.  These two are a couple of likeable characters who find themselves thrown together for a few hours because she needs to go on a job interview and he doesn't have a ride home.

The rest of the movie is just sort of a day-in-the-life of these two souls as they accomplish simple tasks, like going to Target for a new blouse for her, or getting her car washed, or eating a take-out meal.  The blouse is quite revealing, by the way, and will provide gentleman admirers of Ms. Vega with an eyeful.

There are no car chases, gun fights or explosions.  There is an off-screen fight between Ms. Vega and her estranged husband (a dispute over car keys) which sounds as though it may result in a physical injury to him of some sort, but we are not sure what it is that she has done to him.

Mr. Freeman is charming, as ever, but not much of an English accent - that's OK, as I don't really expect it from Americans anymore.

I really enjoyed the soundtrack, too - a nice old Paul Simon song throughout the final sequence.",1190332800,,1173,4.324200913242009
2735526,5,B000MGUZAM,"Here are some words that will surely be used to describe 10 Items Or Less: small, minor, charming, sweet, romantic, witty, smart, touching, little, sunny, innocent.

To this list I would a word I almost never apply to a movie - perfect.  As a friend of mine once said about Mississippi John Hurt, if you don't like this movie you've got a hole in your soul.

Of course, it doesn't hurt to have arguably America's greatest actor - Morgan Freeman - on your team.  The film is a showcase for him - he stars, and executive produced.  More to the point, he is playing (almost) himself.  Of course the irony here is that for most actors that would be the one impossible role - they can play anyone BUT themselves.  Freeman is so thoroughly comfortable and comforting - the avuncular persona and lush voice - that we never question any of the improbabilities and simply drift into this thoroughly odd and quirky reality.

Writer, director, and co-producer Brad Silberling is to be highly commended for a smart, funny, and touching script that came alive on the screen.  The brief appearance of Bobby Cannavale reminded me of a similar movie, Station Agent, which has the same quiet confidence, dry wit, and warmth.  There is no plot worthy of the name, everything rests on the chemistry between Scarlet, the exquisite Paz Vega, and Freeman - and there's enough to burn down the science building.  The fulcrum here is the concept of intersecting lives - and how - in a rare moment of unexpected intimacy and honesty - people can connect and give of themselves generously, with no expectation of return.  It is exquisite.

Morgan as the helpless star, Vega as the tough-minded checkout cashier is such a hilariously improbable pairing that something good must come of it.  Something does - something very, very good - nearly perfect.",1188000000,7,1824,4.749206349206349
2735527,4,B000MGUZAM,"The [...] reviewer called it ""little more than an amusing diversion."" While not all movies are aimed at being that, what on earth is wrong with being an amusing diversion?

We frequently watch action-adventure, intense dramas, etc., and this was just fun to enjoy, and short--which I sort of see as being a bonus.",1187308800,,344,4.655737704918033
2735528,4,B000MGUZAM,"This is a surprisingly funny movie.  The premise of an actor studying a person in their environment for a role is nothing new to Movies or TV, but this one is well done.  It puts together an actor who was running out of his golden years and a retail clerk who is going nowhere fast.  Between their interactions, they find out what it's really important in life, ten items or less at a time.  You have to love the grocery store seen, and the car wash.  Rent this movie, I think you will like it.",1185235200,,494,4.157894736842105
2735529,4,B000MGUZAM,"Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00011RPB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>, the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.

Out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spanglish/dp/B0007OCG56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spanglish</a>) brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby's and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.

Director/screenwriter Brad Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he lensed Alexander Payne's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sideways/dp/B0007TKOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sideways</a>) and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-God/dp/B0000D9PNX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of God</a>). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as funny bits with Jonah Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B00005JPRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>) as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the ""knight"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garden-State/dp/B00005JNC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garden State</a>) as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, ""15 Days or Less"", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.",1185062400,4,3600,6.90989010989011

An actor researching a potential role as a grocery store manager in an independent film hooks up with the express lane (10 items or less) cashier.  And for whatever reason, the stars aline and they bond over the course of the day.  Ending is kinda different and abupt, but hey, its good, keeps you thinking.

8169049,5,B000MGUZAM,"RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Brad Silberling, 10 Items or Less is a drama about an aged has-been actor (Morgan Freeman) who researches for an indie gig after a four-year dry spell. He meets a spitfire checkout clerk named Scarlet (Paz Vega) at a supermarket in a Latino community of Los Angeles. Impressed by the young woman, he decides to help her while psyching-up for the role.

The plot is obviously borrowed from 2003s Lost in Translation. To key you off, the girl is named after Scarlett Johansson. But don't let that keep you from seeing this minor gem because the characters are very different, plus other nuances. For instance, Morgans character (simply called Him in the cast list) reflects the joy of living (joie de vivre) as opposed to Bill Murrays amusing curmudgeon in Lost in Translation.

Moreover, 10 Items is less melancholy; and the girl isn't nave and overly sweet like Charlotte (Johansson) in Lost. Its a small film, with the end credits rolling a mere ten minutes after the hour mark, and so it lacks the depth of Lost and isn't as moving (at least as far as pulling your romantic heartstrings), but its more heartwarming and overall inspiring.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 21 minutes and was shot in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and nearby Carson (to the south).

The two main characters, Paz and Morgan, are so convincing in their respective roles, and for me it's more than enough to carry this movie along.  On top of these two, they have sprinkled in a few other movie stars along the way that will make you exclaim, HA, look, it's so-and-so!  Paz's character in this movie is similar to her role in Spanglish, as far as portraying a regular person who is simply earning a living for herself, and/or trying to better herself.

8169056,5,B000MGUZAM,"Morgan Freeman plays a well-known actor, who hasn't accepted a role in four years, that is considering a film project. The cousin of the director drives him to Archie's Ranch Market,and drops him off to do a little research. He's fascinated by one of the checkers, Scarlet played by the gorgeous Paz Vega, a young woman from Spain with a preternatural ability to ring up items at the cash register at the 10 Items Or Less lane. The actor chats her up, and when her shift ends, he asks for a ride.

Thus begins the movie,10 Items Or Less - a modern day Two For The Road minus the love story. In the course of the movie, he helps her prepare for a job interview. He teaches her to have self-confidence and in the process,he learns to commit from her. The themes of human connection and communication is explored in the story.

The film is great as both Freeman and Vega were honest in their portrayal and have shown great chemistry together. Freeman is as usual always good while Vega needs to improve on her delivery of lines as she evokes less emotion due to her difficulty in speaking English. Overall,the communication and exchange of ideas between two characters - the actor and Scarlet - is practically the whole movie. Although many may find this film boring,I still would enjoy these types of films that provides people a view on how two people of different background can help instill change on one another.",1428364800,,1414,4.58498023715415
