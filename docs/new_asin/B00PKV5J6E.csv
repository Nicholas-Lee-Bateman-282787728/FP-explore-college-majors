But over all it's about Jesus. And.that's the best thing about this life. Jesus!",1521849600,,252,4.163265306122449

8688525,4,B00PKV5J6E,"Unlike some of the other (excellent) recent documentaries about monastic life, this one does not attempt to recreate interiority (i.e., a spiritual inner-life/tradition) through the layering of silence and image, song and prayer; instead, This Side of Eden gives voice to the human beings who are engaging in monastic life at Westminster Abby. That is to say, I feel that where some of the other documentaries could be said to focus on the finished, sumptuous product of monastic life (which isn't a negative), this documentary focuses on the informal, day-to-day process of monastic life, perhaps because it revolves around the younger members of the Westminster Abby community. The film is joyful. Younger viewers might really benefit from watching this film as an aid to discernment. For example, my niece and young grandnephew paid a visit last month, and my grandnephew asked to borrow the film. He has expressed interest in becoming an altar server at his church in a few years.",1457913600,2,984,5.118012422360248
