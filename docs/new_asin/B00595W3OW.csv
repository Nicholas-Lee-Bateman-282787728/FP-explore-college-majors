(a.) Totally dumb and even stolen plot/storyline. Super rich & crooked stereotypes betting on outcome and bomb collars and good guy gets girl and sailboat final.
(b.) Acting or lack of.
(c.) Parkour (i.e. freerunning). The out here is to just go youtubing and get much better runs.
(d.) Cinematography and/or directing and/or editing.
(e.) Script/dialogue from people who don't know what they're talking about, trying to sound like they know what they're talking about.",1323216000,,521,5.214285714285714
4620192,1,B00595W3OW,"And I suppose many first-time directors are inspired by (a.k.a. copy) what they've seen before - because that's all we get with 'Freerunner'. A shoddy clich-ridden prop vehicle made up of parts from other, better, movies; with a derivative plot seemingly scribbled onto the back of a Chinese take-out menu.

My interest in the rental was the Parkour aspect. And what there was - was repetitive, badly choreographed and shot with the detestable shaky-cam. If you can't properly showcase the skill, what's the point of a flick like this?

The stunning ability of some of these young urban athletes is completely lost in this amateurish production. You're honestly better off watching clips on YouTube.

An infinitely more enjoyable, more cogent, parkour-inspired film: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-B13/dp/B000GPPPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District B13</a>"".

The most interesting aspect for me, since the flick itself was ridiculous, was noting how much Sean Faris looks like a taller Tom Cruise. Not an unintentional coincidence I presume.

Personal Note: I have to admit at expending energy attempting to spot the adam's apple of the co-star lead played by actress Rebecca Da Costa.

4620194,4,B00595W3OW,"This is a film about an illegal sport called ""Freerunning."" A group of young men run through the city (filmed in Cleveland), impervious to sidewalks, direct routes, or roads.

Of course once you have the 3 flags needed to win the tournament, you need to be an expert kick boxer to keep them. The running is fast paced with acrobatics done to an appropriate sound track.

Ryan (Sean Faris), one of the runners works mopping floors in a hospital and cares for his bed ridden grandfather. He has a gf (Rebecca Da Costa) who is way out of his league. She sings in a bar and dreams of living on a beach. Ryan, who lost the last race, and has never beaten Finch (Ryan Doyle) decides to go against the rules and bet on himself using a shill so he can make that big score and move to the beach with his gf and gramps.

4620195,4,B00595W3OW,"""I had this idea, put it online and make the kids run against each other, and boom baby, it takes off like wild fire."" After wanting to find a way to get his girlfriend and grandfather out of the city, Ryan, a freerunner in a game, decides to the something illegal. He plans to bet all his money on himself and when he wins they can all leave. Halfway through the race something goes wrong and more then money is at stake. I have found that watching a movie without seeing a preview first has helped my enjoyment of some lesser known movies. This one is a perfect example. Judging by the cover I was expecting something pretty lame. While the acting was a little weak and the plat un-original I really enjoyed this movie. Much like ""Death Race"", the movie is fun and exciting racing scenes with filler in between. A plot almost identical to ""Fighting"" hurt the movie a little, but another very surprising movie to me. I really enjoyed this. Overall, a very entertaining and fast paced movie that is fun to watch. I liked it. I give it a B+.

Would I watch again? - I think I would.

The start out doing this to win money. Then they end up racing for their lives. If you are still watching once you get to this point. Then here is where you probably walk out.

8462680,3,B00595W3OW,"I bought this movie because a friend from high school is in it (Joe Zamora, who plays Miles). We had seen the poor reviews of the movie, but it really wasn't that bad!  It was a typical, entertaining, blow-everything-up sort of movie that kept everyone who watched engaged and interested.  Reminded me a lot of a darker/more sinister version of the movie Rat Race.  Had a few problems with the physics in the movie (how does a body whose head gets blown off at the neck end up being blown over the railing of a bridge?), but as I said, overall it was an average action movie.",1332201600,,575,4.355140186915888
8462681,2,B00595W3OW,"This was probably meant to be a high octane action flick.  What we got was a BIC lighter that is running out of fuel.  There's enough to spark my entertainment, but it doesn't go very far.  This parkour movie stars Sean Faris.  Faris has an unfortunate film career recently including The King of Fighters (2010).  His highest point to date was in Never Back Down (2008).

 This freerunning-flick follows the subculture of capture-the-flag racing competitors who operate under the radar of the law for winner-take-all paydays.  They essentially freerun around the city, gather three flags, and hit the finish line for victory.  However, there aren't really any rules, so the occasional skirmish occurs.  The competitiveness, the older guy who runs the show, and the taunts between freerunners make this feel like a parkour-esque Step Up or You Got Served.  There's the underdog star, his overprotective love interest, his crappy job, his loving grandparent, and the reigning champ that everybody hates...it's a cookie-cutter plot.  Our hero bets all he has on himself for one last race so that he, his girl and his grandfather can move out of the city and be happy.  This attempt to follow the dance-movie formula fails to maintain my interest.  But that's just the first chunk of the flick.  It gets better.

 In the middle of this big race all of the freerunners are captured by some enterprising villain who does exactly what they were already doing--he airs a high betting stakes parkour race for rich people to place bets.  The catch is that they have 60 minutes to finish the race and they all have been fitted with explosive collars which turn their heads into party-poppers after those 60 minutes are up.  There are some other rules to follow to avoid death as well.  So they must literally race as if their lives depended on it.  It's very Death Race meets The Condemned in terms of how their captor manages his web-based betting operation.  Additionally, for no reason whatsoever, their captor offers one million dollars to the winner.  Isn't racing for your life enough?  Maybe the writers just needed to keep the possibility of a happy ending for our protagonist.

 As a funny bit of added flavor and rather contrary to Death Race and The Condemned, their enterprising captor is a lot like a book club party host.  It's ""his turn"" to host.  Next time, one of the others would be in charge of choosing the type of game and the unwilling participants.  The club members, along with most of the delivery of this movie, are all very hokey.  But it's all in good fun and it's rather entertaining.  Really.

 The biggest problem with this flick (ignoring the writing and acting) is that following freerunners is difficult, so there is a lot of shaky camera work and FPS-style head-cam shots.  The stunts are cool, but would be more enjoyable with steadier filming.  More solid examples of parkour in film (in order of increasing awesomeness) include Scott Adkins in The Tournament (2009), the French guy from Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and the epic opening chase scene in District B-13 (2004).  Let's also not forget that basically every Jackie Chan movie doubles as a freerunning movie.  And Jackie has the best resume in the business.  But I digress.

 Freerunner is a bit of mindless fun for a Sunday afternoon.  Just expect nothing and tell yourself this was not meant to be taken seriously.",1332201600,,3403,4.818339100346021
8462682,1,B00595W3OW,"I read the summary of the movie and I love the idea, but the execution was terrible. I know this is a very low budget movie, but, Youtube videos have better graphics then this movie. The effects are terrible. All the explosive are very low quality.

The free running status were good. The about the only thing I think they did well in the movie. I didn't care for the kickboxing or fight scenes because they seemed very stupid.

The acting in this movie is very bad. Only the main guy, Ryan was a good actor. All the others are terrible actors. When they talk, they don't make me believe in them at all. It seemed very scripted and didn't bring me into the movie, but take me out of it really. The web villains seemed very childish at times.

The direction of the movie was bad because as the movie went along, everything seemed to perfect to happened to the main character, Ryan. Spoiler alert...when the group of free runners where being driving away from the green zone from the cops. The free runners will then have to get back to the green zone in 5 mins or they will blow up from the explosive collars. But, they have no way of getting back to the green zone just by running there, even if they got away from the cops. ""Luckily"", Ryan's GF was there with her car to drive them all back to the green zone. Exactly right there, at the right place, at the right time. No way!

Another moment that was too perfect was when, another freerunner, Turk, was there just to save Ryan at the end the movie. It didn't really make sense for Turk to be at Ryan's place and to know to go there at that exact time too. What??? Okay, well. ""Luckily"", Turk was there or the movie would had just ended with a bad ending, which maybe it should had. There were other things like that happened throughout the movie, and it just too convenient for it all fall into place like that.

Probably the worse thing the movie did was kill off Ryan's rival, Flinch, for no good reason. Flinch won the race, but it didn't make any sense that he just went crazy at the end to lose his mind and not to kill Ryan but to talk back to the head villain, Mr. Frank, of the movie. He then get's blown up for doing that. What??? Now, there's nothing stopping Ryan from just going after the Mr. Frank.

The movie needed to stop being too easy for the main star of the movie. It needed better acting and effects. The kickboxing was okay, but wasn't really needed. They could had thought about doing something else then that. It's a good idea to pass on this movie, because there's so many other better movies then this.",1330387200,,2581,4.28952772073922
8462683,4,B00595W3OW,"This video was exactly what I expected out of a Free Running movie.  Similar to movies such as The Tournament or District B13, the story line and acting aren't the best, but people who watch these movies are watching for the stunts.  The parkour and free running elements are great and it was worth the watch.",1328486400,,309,4.5
