8173521,3,B000AAF1ZE,"Bought this on the cheap because of the many black metal videoclips not available anywhere else, among which the 6 ones of Impaled Nazarene, 2 of an Immortal VHS, Absu, Antaeus, Arkhon Infaustus, Diabolos Rising, Melesch, Seth and gothic avant-garde Notre Dame. There are 6 other bands I didn't care for and some very bad-sounding live material in the guise of bonus tracks.

All the clips are pre 2000 which I loved but pic quality is mediocre VHS at best and varies a lot. OTOH sound is fantastic LPCM. At 2h 30' of extreme metal there's something for everyone here, just don't expect to like everything as it usually happens with comps/samplers.

Buy it from the bargain bin or used",1440201600,,685,4.7
