7920577,4,B00004OCYJ,"""Grandma's Boy"" (1922) remains one of Harold Lloyd's best films  a winning comedy-drama with good laughs and plenty of heart. The film's emphasis on characterization plays better on television than some of Harold's later features, which truly benefit from a big-screen presentation. A cinematic breakthrough on par with Chaplin's ""The Kid"" (1921) and Keaton's ""Our Hospitality"" (1923).",1436745600,,385,5.754385964912281
7920578,5,B00004OCYJ,"We saw this in TCM. My boyfriend gets bored with silent films, but he liked this one because it was so old-fashioned and wholesome.  I think Grandma was so sweet and cute. I hope that when I am a grandma, I look like her.  It was fun watching her dance a jig.  The heroine and other girls in the neighborhood were so cute too. I know it was another era, but I am always amazed how teens in the olden days dressed so differently from teens today in order to look coy and fetching. I think the tramp looked a LOT like Shrek. But my favorite little moment was when Harold had all of his courage up, and the talisman firmly in hand, and then the black cat crossed his path.  Oh no! what's he going to do now?!  The ending was so sweet, but just enough time for one more little gag. I wonder where it was filmed. Was it in the old San Fernando Valley? It sure looks like modern day Fillmore.",1132963200,,886,4.068965517241379
7920579,4,B00004OCYJ,"All through April on TCM they have been playing Harold Lloyd comedies. I believe all of his silents features, many of his talking pictures and a few shorts. They have been beautifully remastered. The prints looks fantastic and they all have brand new scores. I only mention this because I've noticed some people complain about the way these old copies look. I haven't seen them so I honestly can't compare the two. I have also heard the music score to these films are quite bad. Usually some ragtime piano or organ music.
 I hope the Harold Lloyd Trust will begin to release the new versions they have. Because anyone you appreciates Lloyd's comedies, NEEDS to see these new beautiful prints.
 ""Grandma's Boy"" is a comedy I have heard much about. Many see it as the film that ""made"" Lloyd. The one comedy that started to set his name apart from others. I believe it is a wonderful movie. It does something very few Lloyd comedies do. It contains heartfelt moments. I've found that in all of Lloyd's movies we care about his character. We want him to succeed. We want him to get the girl in the end. To prove himself worthy in the father's eyes. To actually survive the stunts. He was seen as the ""everyman"". But, even though all Lloyd comedies possess this quality few have taken full advantange of it. When I personally say that one Lloyd comedy is better than another I'm not speaking about laughs. I find that too subjective to rate a movie by. Just because I laughed at something, doesn't mean everyone else will. When I recommend one Lloyd comedy over another I'm thinking about the character development. The way the film is constructed. Are there moments when the viewer connects with the film. Are the plots fully realized. In my opinion Lloyd's best films based on my standard are ""Girl Shy"", ""The Kid Brother"" and this film. It's these movies that seem to be more motivated by plot and characters rather than sight gags and laughs. Now, I know what most of you are thinking. Who wants to watch a Harold Lloyd comedy without laughs. First of all, every Harold Lloyd movie has laughs. I have yet to see anything he has done that didn't make me laugh. Secondly, I've already explained I don't feel it's fair to judge a movie purely on how many times I laughed. I'm much more interested in the story. Look at Chaplin. Chaplin took his time creating a story.
 But, back to ""Grandma's Boy"". It tells the story of a cowardly boy (played by guess who) who has been bullied his whole life. Now older, and in love Harold still gets bullied around. One day a robbery happens and the entire town is on the look out for a tramp (and no Chaplin is not in this movie). Lloyd's Grandmother senses what's wrong with Lloyd and comes up with a story about a magical charm that Lloyd's grandfather had that gave him courage. And you can probably guess where the film will go once Lloyd gets the charm that will give him courage.
 If you've seen movies like ""The Kid Brother"" and ""Girl Shy"" and you've enjoyed them, this movies follows in the tradition those movies were. It carries heart and sentiment and of course laughs. But they blend perfectly. If your not interested in more sentimental Lloyd films and strickly want to see his ""thrill movies"" try and find ""Safety Last"", ""Feet First"", and ""Girl Shy"" also contains a thrill sequence at the end. ""Grandma's Boy"" is a movie most fans should be pleased with.
 Bottom-line: One of Lloyd's best films. Concentrates more on plot then sight gags. Blends drama and comedy in a way Chaplin would have. A wondeful film.",1051488000,,3555,4.583333333333333
7920580,5,B00004OCYJ,"I was fortunate enough to see the Harold Lloyd short NEVER WEAKEN during a Paragon Ragtime Orchestra production in Pittsburgh.  This was my first experience with this electrifying performer.  Anyone who has seen this short will understand when I say that I raced home to order ANY of his movies that I could find.  GRANDMA'S BOY was the first one I came upon, and I clicked the ""Buy"" button without hesitation.  I'd be lying if I didn't say I was more than a little shocked the first time through this film.  Compared to the frantic, hilarious NEVER WEAKEN, well, it's just so different!  But it didn't take me long to determine that it was different in a great way.  There is much more character development in this feature length film, but it's paced so well that it never drags.  Clever gags are placed all through the film to keep anyone's attention.  And, unlike most of Chaplin's and Keaton's works, the girl gets her share of portraying the hilarity.  Mildred's ""I Love You"" song is one of the movie's fantastic highlights.  Just that big ol' bow in her hair is enough to give me the giggles.  Even the title cards are used for a laugh, not just for the words they contain -- although that's funny too -- but for how they're constructed on the screen.
Now, for those of you silent comedy fans who are accustomed to Kino's Keaton releases, or Chaplin's Centennial Collection, you are not going to get that kind of preserved quality print here, or in most any Harold Lloyd VHS available today; which is a grotesque, horrible shame.  There are scratches all through the film, not all the words on the title cards fit in the screen, and sometimes the contrast is so bad as to ruin certain gags.  (What was it that granny put on Harold's shoes that attracted the cats?  First word was ""goose"", so I'm guessing liver ??)  Even with thses flaws in the video print itself, I would've paid twice the amount for this movie.  It's as endearing as any of the Little Tramp's melodrama-comedies, without all the syrupy sweetness; and the gags are just as exciting as most any of Keaton's, with a slightly off-kilter ending to boot.
