Penn did an excellent job, and nicholson givesa magnificently understated performance.

1282167,5,B00003CXSH,"In what a local Los Angeles critic affectionately coined as his  ""Trilogy of Anguish"" (in a brilliant review)...Sean Penn has here mastered all of his inherent skills as a visionary artist to not only produce his greatest work, but one of the finest American films in years. This is NOT a thriller about a serial killer. This is an emotionally ravaging story of an honest man's slow descent into madness...while the flow of life around him will continue undisturbed regardless. I can't help but think that Penn has weaned himself on the likes of Fellini, Bergman, and Cassavetes, for each of these greats are unwitting influences on him if nothing else. His own visual sensibility is astounding, and has been since ""The Indian Runner"". Now I must say that the audience for this kind of picture is small, but the fact that it got made and in this release cut is encouraging as hell. Special bravos to Nicholson, cinematographer Chris Menges, and the entire supporting cast. We love you, Sean. You are a beautiful soul.",981244800,2,1017,4.811428571428571
1282168,3,B00003CXSH,"I went to go see The Pledge last night after hearing numerous praises for it, and I must say, overall, I was disappointed with the film. Let's first work on pros: (I'm not going to give a synopsis, because if you're reading this, you've already read the reviews adajcent to mine which contain the summary) Jack Nicholson was perfect. His performance was astounding, and I am really sad this was a January release, as Oscar has a tendency to forget the early ones. (The Silence Of The Lambs being an exception--February `91, if my memory serves) Also, the cameos, or small parts, delivered by Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke were phenomenal. Absolutley riviting. And there are at least two jump out of your seat shocks in the film, ones that had me breathing heavily for a minute after. But now the cons. The movie, at some points was a solid 3 and a half star film (out of 4) I was happy with the characters, I had a feeling everything was going to work out in the end, and I was content. But by the end of the film, things get messed up royally. There is no satisfactory form of closure in this movie, and it leaves you wanting things to be different. This is just my opinion, I could be wrong.
Now you see, I have no problem with Nicholson, or Penn, or even the screenwriters, because this problem stems from the source material, the book. Even though I don't know why Penn and crew would be so intent on making a film with this type of ending, I don't blame them. Penn coaxed some incredible performances out of his actors, and he is to be commended. As for whether or not this DVD is going to be on my shelf? That's a big negative.",980467200,5,1638,4.356209150326797

1282310,5,B00003CXSH,"This fifteen-year-old film with a good cast and starring Jack Nicholson who acts splendidly is great, well-worth watching. It was directed by Sean Penn. Nicholson plays a paunchy, mustached, balding detective who discovers the brutalized sexually-assaulted body of a young girl just several hours before he retired. The girl's mother begs him to swear that he will find the girl's killer and despite being retired he makes the pledge.
One of the officers in Nicholson's prior unit gets a confession to the murder from a mentally disturbed man. The officer puts words in his mouth. The confessed man commits suicide.
Nicholson is convinced that the dead man did not kill the girl. He soon finds, or thinks he finds, proof that there have been serial killings. He asks help from his former colleagues who refuse.

1282393,5,B00003CXSH,"This movie has numerous echoes of ""The Shining.""
First ""echo"" is the camera-work, which films several scenes from overhead, showing Jack in the context of the mountain scenery, as Kubrick filmed Jack in the opening scenes of Jack's VW moving up a thin road to the Overlook Hotel in the Canadian mountains.
The intense action of The Shining takes place in hotel rooms; the intense action of The Pledge takes place in the rambling house behind a gas station.
Both films revolve around the theme of futile attempts to protect children.
In The Pledge  Jack, like Jack's son Danny in the Shining, is shown throwing darts -- notice that each character throws the darts with the same gestures.
In the Pledge Jack is accused by his ""wife"" (Robin Penn) of abusing her daughtger by exposing her to danger and of being crazy.  Likewise, in The Shining, Jack's wife Wendy accuses him of abusing Danny, when she sees the marks on Danny's neck (after he visited Room 237).  In Pledge Jack is able to intuit the Killer's plans; in other words, Jack has ""shinings"" -- like his child Danny had in The Shining.  The Pledge's Jack notices emotional resonances and connections that his fellow detectives cannot.

The Pledge and The Shining can be seen as ""book-end"" movies about child abuse. One version followed many years later by another version on the same theme.

Jewlywood's Elite evidently loves repeating the theme of destroying innocence -- of child sacrifice -- of parents betraying their children -- the ultimate ""finger in the eye"" of Christian morality. (Childood's End, so to speak, as enshrined in the novel by the pedophile Arthur Clark.)

p.s. The movies ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Ninth Gate"" also are ""book-end"" movies on same theme of raping an innocent partner to give birth to a Satanic child.

1282609,2,B00003CXSH,"I bought this movie on the seemingly large numbers of positive reviews here and the apparently well known cast.

I have to say first up that I was MAJORLY disappointed.
It starts off well enough with a quite interesting premise being set up, and although you probably surmise exactly where it's going, things seem promising and you sit back for the story to develop.

WHICH IT DOESN'T!!!

After the introduction, that particular storyline is abandoned, or just put on hold,  and instead you get another movie altogether.
It's one about Jack Nicholson's retirement to some backwoodsian lakeside shanty-town where he joins the local-yokels, buys a run down roadside store and devotes himself to fishing.

(Some of the aforementioned mouth-breathing , intellectually deprived inhabitants shown on-screen just HAVE to be genuine examples of why it's not a good idea for families to repeatedly allow brother/sister marriages! It can't all be make-up surely?)

Actually , you too will probably realise that SO many of the cast seem to be severely intellectually dis-abled for some reason. Why? Are they all in-bred out in the woods in America? Or were they just cheap to hire as extras?
The first murder suspect; the inmates of some sort of mental facility; the owner of a Christmas store; the daughter of the owner of the gas station; not to mention the patrons of the local bar. All of them appear to be quite obviously mentally challenged for some odd reason. The average I.Q. of the whole town wouldn't be over single digits!

After Jack blows a motsa of his retirement fund for the highly dubious business opportunity of the hick gas station, it's ONE word from then on folks, ...just the one!
SLOW !!!
Maybe that should be written....S..........L...........O................W.....?

The performances are good enough, ...with the possible exception of the Chief of Police who thinks he's a comic, and he becomes quite irritating very early on.

The cinematography itself is probably the best thing about the whole movie, but the artfully composed shots, and slick travelling pans just can't starve off  boredom, which is an ever-present threat of setting in. Permanently!

The co-incidences and absolutely pathetically weak ""red-herrings"" thrown in here are far more plentiful than any fish Jack Nicholson manages to catch in the lake!

SO OBVIOUS!
The movie even resorts to visually shocking, but totally FAKE, very quickly seen scenarios a couple of times to try to elicit at least some interest, but as they are immediately then shown to be only ""imaginings"", it's back to the old ennui. Just more of the plodding tale of Old Jack's attempts at playing ""Happy Families"" with the child of some battered ex-wife pickup who's half his age. (THAT last bit seems more than a little creepy when you sit through it!)

If you are still awake now, (and believe me that will be an effort!), you'll no doubt be expecting a possible ripper finish to repay you for sitting through the glacial pace of a film that could induce a state of coma in even the most hyperactive amongst us!

SPOILER ALERT:
IT NEVER COMES!
NOTHING!

There's a very weak ""artsy"" attempt at an ironic ending, but as it's so well known that Americans simply do not understand that particular concept AT ALL, you too will wonder why they went for it.

No one, ...neither the police nor Jack seem able to draw the VERY obvious conclusion from a roadside accident they see as they return from a stakeout?
They were all waiting for a large black station-waggon to show up, ....the very same sort of vehicle that has just been involved in the accident on it's way to the place they have just come from?
Are they all dumb or what?

Jack, who up until now has been represented as a reasonably astute sort of bloke, now apparently suffers some sort of mental breakdown at his bizarre inability to solve the crime. The film concludes with a dishevelled Nicholson sitting amidst the dilapidated remnants of his store, just repeatedly muttering to himself like some schizophrenic old unkempt alcoholic.

This depressing scene is maintained for a VERY long time, thus giving you too plenty of time to mutter to YOUR self over just how you were conned into watching this right to the end in the vain hope that something would happen to at least reward you for your patience....and endurance!

Perhaps the whole thing is a metaphor about how if you retire to the backwoods and associate long enough with all the mentally deficient hillbillys, then you too will lose your marbles and end up a gibbering idiot? SO reduced in cranial capacity that you will be unable to draw even the most simple of connections between clues that are so damned blatantly presented that a three-year old could grasp the solution?

Just the two stars from me, ...and they're mainly for the cinematography, certainly not for the apparently non-existent editing. Otherwise don't waste your time.",1404172800,,4918,4.902409638554217

1282611,5,B00003CXSH,"One sees an emotional side of Nicholson, rarely captured.
 The theme or conflict between his need to potentially put in danger a young girl to eliminate the threat of a child killer and it's consequences is not so clearly right or wrong. It's very thought provoking.",1402099200,,266,4.782608695652174

1282613,2,B00003CXSH,"SPOILERS:  The first time this was filmed as IT HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, 1957, with Gert Frobe giving such an amazing performance that the Broccoli's immediately cast him in GOLDFINGER.  The second filming was as COLD LIGHT OF DAY, with Richard E Grant, 1996.  In both of those film versions we see the killer caught, but not in any shootout, but rather in a way that the child ""bait"" for the killer is spared any anguish, and her sensibilities are not damaged.  I highly recommend seeing those two and skipping THE PLEDGE,  the third filming.  Here we see a completely chaotic ending with a confused, traumatized child who loses the closet thing to a father in Nicholson, who ends up  a drunk mindlessly babbling at the end, alone and completely broken, his  reputation with his former colleges destroyed, and the mother of the ""bait"" child turned in to one who was formerly battered, ending up the batterer of Nicholson!  I tell you, folks, wacky Hollywood has done it again.  Totally trashed, mashed and otherwise wasted the albeit great performances by the actors involved in this convoluted sequel.  As a completest, I will keep all three, but THE PLEDGE will not be viewed last (and best, like other sequels), the next time I watch them.  The bottom line is that the killer of the children is such a driving force in the plot of all these movies, and it is a master stroke of the first two movies to cast an actor who evokes a  persona of evil that we are rewarded by seeing him up close  and personal, with all his spooky, yet charming (to children) attributes, not as a smoking, burned up corpse, barely visible in a wrecked car in flames, as in the PLEDGE.",1400371200,,1668,4.591216216216216

Marlon wanted to end his film with his girlfriend killed as they rode away together from a shootout, which some say would have heightened the power and irony of the film. Instead, the editors chose to keep the girl alive, and have the two ride off into the sunset. Happy ending, happy audience. Such is not the case here, with director Sean Penn, true to Brando, choosing to end the film with as many questions as it began--leaving Nicholson's detective character a confused pile of mush. Unhappy ending, unhappy audience. The movie did not do well at the box office--though highly acclaimed critically. Did anyone bother to see the connection between the burned up black car, the porcupine? toy, and the picnic rendezvous with the little girl? And what happened to that boy in the beginning who witnessed a man running from the first little girl's body in the woods, then getting into his red pickup truck?

1282743,2,B00003CXSH,"I've rarely been this disappointed in, even irritated by, a film.  The story has great resonance--possibilities for the symbolic if not archetypal.  On the day of his retirement, the detective played by Jack Nicholson has one more opportunity to perform an act worthy of Ingmar Bergman's knight in ""The Seventh Seal,"" who is seeking to perform one significant, possibly redeeming action, in the face of death that is plaguing the homeland to which he has just returned from the Crusades.  But Sean Penn's manipulative camera, permitting the viewer to see even smaller pieces of the action than Hitchcock's, ultimately fails to deliver not just the suspense, surprise, and reward of a Hitchcock masterpiece but fails to ""say"" anything--about working and retiring, or completing the hero's circle of life, or the importance of even ""trying"" to fulfill a pledge even if the result must inevitably prove futile.

Many of us embark on a journey of life as teachers, preachers, physicians, parents and protectors, only to realize, at journey's end, that we've fallen short of our early idealist dreams.  To receive one more chance to set things right, and take a pledge to do so, is an opportunity almost too good to be true, though the very possibility stirs us with thoughts of a ""life well-lived,"" a journey ""successfully completed."" Perhaps Penn even had such a thought in mind as the overarching, archetypal narrative frame for the movie.  But in the end he throws his audience under the bus as assuredly as he does the anonymous, unapprehended killer Nicholson has pledged to bring to justice ""on his very soul.""

Some viewers will no doubt reward the film points on the basis of a closure that runs contrary to virtually every one of the ""Law and Order,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and sexual deviant shows that now run, endlessly and back-to-back, on cable TV.  Unfortunately, that's not reason enough to like ""The Pledge.""  Poets, novelists, musicians, and especially scriptwriters study ""closure"" as though it were a form unto itself--it can make or break all that has preceded the end.  Moreover, Penn's camera has been so ultra-selective in what it chooses to reveal to the spectator--from the incredulous, chubby face of the young boy who witnesses something horrible (the molestation that initiated Nicholson's ""encore"" as a law man) to the conflagration that erases not merely the sexual deviant but his identity--that the camera's cat-and-mouse game, even at the climactic moment. breaks the covenant that must exist between a filmmaker and his audience for any movie to assert its power to suspend disbelief.

I can't go much further without ""giving away"" the movie.  But try, if you might, to imagine a Norman Bates (""Psycho"") who is erased from the story with Janet Leigh's final glimpse of him; or of a Kim Novak who vanishes with Jimmy Stewart's inference that she has drowned in the Bay; or, to take another film and director, Jimmy Stewart's suicide on Christmas eve as reportage for the Potter-owned ""Bedford Falls News"" on Christmas Day.  Disappointing?  Depressing? Irresponsible?  Yes, it's all that and more, because the director would have violated his ""pledge"" to the viewer to conceal but eventually ""to heal.""

Some may defend the ending on the grounds that in some wacky sense ""The Pledge"" is completed, since the rapist who motivated Nicholson's valiant, self-sacrificing quest is brought to a swift and sure end in a fiery inferno.  But of what value is the fulfillment of a promised pledge if nobody knows?  (We might wonder if Penn has asked the same question about his efforts as a film-actor/film-maker.)  And even if justice accomplished is known only to us the spectators, what if it comes at the expense of an American Indian (who now will remain the ""confessed killer"" of the film's first rape)?  Is that fair to the Indian?  And if Nicholson was proven right (but only to himself and us) in his driving, and honorable, belief that coerced confessions are not to be trusted, what hope does the film leave for genuine justice the next time some poor sap, or the ""usual suspect,"" is brought to court on suspicion of rape and harrassed until he'll say anything, including a false confession?

The best moment in the film, at least for this experienced film-goer, is the ascending reddish ballon belonging to Chrissie (the 2nd girl), along with the ominous feelings of dread that it evokes in Nicholson and us.  Somewhat like the shoot-out in ""The Untouchables"" with Kevin Coster (the scene on the steps of a train station when our attention is suddenly directed to a mother's out-of-control, rapidly descending baby carriage--a scene lifted from Eisenstein's ""Potemkin""), the unattended, rising ballon is an ""inside"" allusion that only the film-literate will catch immediately.  It's from Fritz Lang's powerful movie, ""M"" (1930), as daring a film as any that comes to mind.  It tries to make the case for a child-molester-killer (Peter Lorre), who ""cannot help himself.""  Was that Penn's purpose--to spare the offender the usual justice--a shoot-out with Nicholson? Or possibly to work around the child-killer's capture, leading to the capital punishment that Lang abhorred?  (Maybe Penn simply wanted to avoid taking on an issue as controversial as sparing child killers from the death penalty.)  Who knows? Who cares? In this case, the personal success of his evasive tactic led to the downfall of his forgettable film.",1389484800,,5446,5.06152125279642

1282837,5,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge is IMO one of Nicholson's best performances because he actually creates a great screen character, Detective Jerry Black. The plot is that Jerry is at his retirement party after decades of civil service. Jerry is well respected by his fellow cops both young and old for his retirement present they send him on a fishing trip to Mexico. But there are scenes throughout the film that show that Jerry is not really happy about retiring. Instead he seems to be conflicted with the idea of being on permanent vacation.
The title of the movie comes when a little girl is found murdered. Jerry leaves his retirement party to join the investigation, even though his fellow officers discourage him from joining. Jerry ""pledges"" to the murdered girl's mother that he will find the culprit. The character of Jerry Black then goes a bizarre life trek. He doesn't go fishing in Mexico, instead he moves to a small Nevada county in the center of an area where two other little girls went missing and were found murdered. Jerry believes that there is someone in the immediate are murdering little girls who fit a certain description. Jerry goes to outrageous lengths to solve this crime which only he believes is still unsolved, the police, otoh have already blamed and basically executed a suspect who they claimed was guilty.
The Pledge is a great movie but it may not be for everyone especially people who like happy Hollywood endings. We the audience never learn the whole truth behind this movie but neither does Jerry so I guess that's ok. I recommend this movie highly because of Nicholson's great acting and also a cast that includes true Hollywood royalty like Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright, the movie was directed by her then husband Sean Penn.

By the end of the year we had a lot on our minds, least of all best actor nominations.  It must have kept critics and audiences away too.  What a shame.
For me, it was and still is Jack Nicholson's finest performance to date.  Never mind his Oscars and Oscar nominations, forget Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, Carnal Knowledge, Chinatown, Cuckoo's Nest, Crossing Guard,  Prizzi's Honor and The Departed all of which his character portrayals are believable and worthy of accolades.  Of course, there were stinkers amidst these movies.  You know, where Nicholson plays Nicholson, and wins an award.  Jack, you can't fool me.  I can tell when you go beyond your acting skills and get into the skin & bones of a character.
Such a movie is ""The Pledge"".  Directed by Sean Penn, and very un-Penn like.  Because, we see a single well formed character and relate to him and him only.  Sorry Sean, I am not lambasting your other movies, only this character portrayal is beyond the usual; he has after all, given his word, his promise, his oath, his vow, his ""Pledge"".
I will not give away any information on this movie, because I feel it is Jack's best acting performance.
You watch it, take it in and when it's over, remember he is only acting...or is he?

1282933,4,B00003CXSH,"Jack Nicholson gives a solid performance in this crime mystery produced and directed by Sean Pean who also directed Nicholson in the film THE CROSSING GUARD. Nicholson plays Nevada homicide cop Jerry Black. On the day of Black's retirement he is called to a brutal murder scene of a young girl. When telling her parents what has happened to their daughter he makes a solemn oath, A PLEDGE, to the mother that he will find the girls killer. Back at the police station they have apprehended a mentally handicapped man who ultimately confesses to the crime. The case is closed but, now retired, Black is not convinced that they found the right man. He then begins an odyssey to find who he believes is the REAL killer. He relocates to an area where other murders of young girls have occurred and starts a new life. He meets a young woman named Laurie, (Robin Wright), who has a young daughter, and begins a relationship with her. The ultimate question of the movie is, in the end which will be stronger, Jerry's feelings for Laurie and her daughter or the deep seeded promise he made to the murdered girl's mother. The first keeps him grounded and secure and the second slowly drains him of his soul and his sanity. This psychological crime drama has one of the best group of supporting actors in film today. I have never seen such a great ensemble of actors put together in smaller budget film and their acting really bolsters the credibility of the story. The cinematography is also gorgeous especially the scenes of winter in the western U.S.. The only flaw I can see is in the screenplay which lack the necessary fluidity for this type of film. The story of Jerry's slow descent into madness, is not developed as well as it should be and that makes the film a bit choppy. All in all great directing by Penn and wonderful acting by a topnotch cast in a good but not great psychological thriller.",1351555200,,1895,4.576470588235294
1282934,2,B00003CXSH,"An incredible cast with incredible acting lost completely in this drawn out droll of a movie.  This looks to be a typical Sean Penn movie with a long, dedicated storyline leading nowhere.  A serial killer of young female children seems to have been caught but Jack Nicholson, a retiring detective, believes otherwise and pledges to the child's mother to find the killer.  He retires to fishing and pumping gas in the area where the serial killer is expected to re-appear.  Clues abound for the killer but are unrecognised by the one expert who should be paying attention.  His relationship with a female bartender and her daughter develops wonderfully and then deteriorates when a set-up to catch the killer using the daughter as bait does not materialize.  Why!! The killer has been killed in a car wreck on the way to the sting operation.  The relationship that you admire is shattered by mistrust, and the killer is never exposed.  In between all of this is boring, meaningless daily life that leads to nothing worthwhile for the story.  What happened to the pledge and its fulfilment for the grieving mother.  Who knows!!",1348531200,,1125,4.873684210526315
1282935,5,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge opens with Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) mumbling to himself and begins to unfold in flashback. On the eve of Jerry's retirement, a young girl is found murdered in a small, neighboring town. With a few hours remaining until he's officially retired, Jerry accompanies the police to the crime scene. The local police do not wish to tell the parents, forcing Jerry to deliver the news himself.

It's this scene that reveals The Pledge to be more than a police procedural or murder-mystery. Jerry arrives at the parents' home, a turkey farm and the camera is kept far away and static while we see (but don't hear) Jerry tell them about their daughter. The girl's mother (Patricia Clarkson) asks Jerry to promise to find her daughter's killer and he hesitantly pledges that he will. Hours later, a mentally retarded Indian (Benicio Del Toro) is fingered as the killer and kills himself moments after a confession is coaxed out of him by a young, cocky detective (Aaron Eckhart). Officially, the case is closed but Jerry doesn't believe it and ditches a planned vacation trip and begins interviewing relatives of the girl, discovering similar unsolved murders in the area. Despite compelling evidence, his former co-workers in the department ignore him. Jerry continues his search, buying a gas station he is sure the killer will pass through and becoming involved with Lori (Robin Wright), a waitress whose daughter resembles the murder victims.

This is the third film directed by Sean Penn and his second collaboration with Jack Nicholson after The Crossing Guard. Aside from being one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Penn also shows himself to be a confident and talented director. Both films he's made with Nicholson portray driven, but deeply flawed individuals on a quest to do what they believe is right, with deep psychological urges dictating their moves. At face value, The Pledge sells itself as a murder-mystery with the familiar motif of a retired cop on one last case and indeed, it plays like one too. It's actually a character study hiding behind the veil of a murder mystery and it is complex enough that you may not be aware of this until the final scene.

The script by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski (based on a novella by Friedrich Drrenmatt) wisely avoids spoon-feeding information to the audience. It sets up scenarios but allows you to draw your own conclusions about what they represent. When Jerry meets Lori and her daughter Chrissy, we realize that she resembles the murdered girls and when Jerry asks them to move in with him, we're left to decide whether his charity masks something more ominous.

Penn underplays everything and never allows The Pledge to descend into spectacle. There's nothing flashy about the film and Penn (along with his cinematographer Chris Menges) creates a subtle miasma that complements the intelligent subtlety of the script. After only three films, he's a remarkably assured director that very quietly led his film into places that mainstream films hardly dare to venture.

Made on a fairly small budget, The Pledge is peppered with familiar faces filling out the supporting roles. The recognizable ones include Tom Noonan, Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sam Shepard. With so many well-known actors, it'd be easy to distract the audience from the core story but Penn found a way (however unintentional it may have been) to make their presence work. Because their roles are so small and the actors are often immediately identifiable, it allows us to more quickly focus on what the purpose of the scene is rather than trying to unravel some mystery about their characters in our heads. The Pledge is a master class of acting from all involved. Tom Noonan as a mysterious preacher has the rare quality of seeming like the nicest, yet creepiest man which makes his character intriguingly mysterious. He was an inspired, though obvious choice for this part. The old homily ""big things come in small packages"" is a perfect description for Rourke's small part as the father of a missing girl. With barely over a minute of screen time, Rourke delivers an emotional monologue that is heartbreaking and unforgettable. This was at a low-point in his career and should've been enough to warrant a comeback opportunity that he wouldn't see materialize until several years later.

Then of course there's Jack Nicholson, one of our greatest living actors. Despite such an eclectic and mesmerizing body of work, Nicholson has always had a persona that he injects into his roles. His performance as Jerry Black probably strays the farthest from that persona and shows Nicholson as his most subdued. It may also be his most tragic character, with Nicholson giving a devastating portrayal of a man driven by his own compulsions and insecurities to do the right thing, even if it costs him his sanity. It's a haunting performance.

I first saw the film nearly five years ago and I vividly recall how frustrated I was by it. I watched it again almost immediately after and my frustration remained. The reason for this is the same reason that will make-or-break the film for many people; the ending. The film enjoyed a wide release, but not commercial success. This ending is why. It's surprising, shocking, and initially very unsatisfying. I admit that it wasn't until seeing it twice that I even fully understood what had happened. This is a film that demands your attention. For me, I've never minded ambiguous endings but I perceived this ending to have such a profound lack of closure I was actually angry. Returning to the film some years later, my perception has changed. The film is a character study, not a murder-mystery and the ending does justice to that intent. It was a brave move for Penn to use it, as it's one of the most surprising, hopeless, and un-Hollywood endings I've seen in years. It defies audience expectation and will frustrate many who see it, but few will argue that it is unforgettable.

This is an unforgettable, hopeless, and haunting film that boasts one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances.  It's not a perfect film; there are some areas that could've benefited from more depth and it could've tapped into Jerry's psychological urges a bit more, but it left a remarkable (and admittedly unfavorable) impression on me five years ago and I hadn't forgotten about it since. Revisiting it, it's one of those films that failed to garner much attention and now languishes in the annals of great, forgotten films just begging for re-examination and a re-birth. I assure you The Pledge is a masterpiece, albeit a forgotten one.",1341360000,,6664,4.974865350089766

Some movies are heavy and deep, others appeal to you because they are fun, picturesque, exciting, or nostalgic. Some are great, but you wouldn't want to watch them often. Others are movies you can watch again and again.
This movie is trying to be deep and artsy, but there is nothing to be dramatic about. It's sorta like two hours of hyping the complexities of a degenerate, living in a world
where police work is more like a sitcom version than reality.
I love most genres and types. Slow movies, fast movies, classics, courtroom dramas, action, suspense, independent, thrillers, foreign, nonfiction. This movie has no redeeming qualities. Everything about it is awful. The subtleties aren't subtle, they are rubbed in and cheap. The atmosphere falls apart. There is emphasis on trivialities and no substance. It is emotionless and the story is pointless. You walk away with nothing. No sadness or sympathy, no happiness, no thought-provoking situations, no ambiguity, no sense of meaning.

1282939,4,B00003CXSH,"Reno detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is only four hours from his retirement when a call comes in about a particularly brutal murder of a little girl. When he talks to the girl's parents, the mother insists he swear on a cross the child made, swear on his salvation, to find the murderer.

The police who are still on the case (Jerry is now retired) quickly find their suspect and wring a confession out of him just before he steals a policeman's gun and kills himself. They figure the case is closed, but Jerry isn't satisfied, because he watched the way the poor wretch, who had some pretty severe and obvious mental problems, had been manipulated into confessing.

Jerry does some digging and discovers that there have been three other murders in the area in the last several years, so similar that the victims were all blonde little girls in red dresses. So Jerry goes his own way to try to solve the murders. I won't ruin it for you by telling you what his way is.

1282940,5,B00003CXSH,"If ever there was a film that deserved an Academy Award for acting it would be this film, with Jack Nicholson in 'The Pledge'. His performance is remarkable. Sean Penn directs this film, and as we know, Sean Penn does not like the ordinary, he goes for the unusal charcters that shape and define our lives. This film has a grocery list of some of our finest actors,Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright Penn, Sam Shepard, Helen Mirren, Patricia Clarkson, Beau Daniels, Michael O'Keefe, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Eileen Ryan, Sam Shepard, and Harry Dean Stanton. Each scene was a gem, and the last third of the film has you on the edge of your seat.

The film begins as a police story and then becomes a story of one man and his personal issues. Jack Nicholson, Detective Jerry Black, is a good policeman who on the eve of his retirement is brought into a grisly crime of a young girl who is murdered. It is thought that the killer is found and that answers this crime. However, Jack Nicholson's character does not believe this man was the murderer and goes on to find clues to solve this mystery. At the beginning of the film, he 'pledges' to the mother of the first murdered child that he will finds the killer. Jerry goes to such extremes as to buy an isolated gas station in the midst of the wilds of Nevada. He has found that the killer has a pattern, and he thinks that this town is near the area where the killer may next strike. A telling scene, is when Jerry visits a psychiatrist, played by Helen Mirren. He wants assitance in drawing out clues from a drawing the murdered child drew. What happens is that the psychiatrist is able too draw out Jerry, and the first signs appear that something is not right.

This is not a simple story, but a very complicated look into the mind of a good man who has problems. The film is gripping and the characters are so intricate and nvolved that we are drawn in as more than just viewers. The photography is beautiful and the back areas of Nevada are shown in all its glory. In the closing credits I found that the film was shot in Canada, and that was a disappointment. Jack Nicholson delivers the role of his life and once again shows us what this type of ability can give to a film. I am surprised I had never heard of this film until recently. I would urge everyone to view it.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-25-12

1282942,4,B00003CXSH,"Oddly, I hadn't heard of ""The Pledge"" until searching for a freebie to watch on Netflix. I love Jack Nicholson and saw this film as an undiscovered gem. The story of a retired cop out to get an extremely violent pedophile murderer pulled me in and kept me riveted through many scenes, but in some of them, Penn spent so much time on atmosphere, camera angles, and the scenery, that I found myself getting a little annoyed, and this killed the build up that he was obviously aiming for, but failed to deliver. I believe the film would have been better paced and less frustrating to watch at times if Penn cut 30 minutes from it. This wouldn't have made this movie any less powerful because the writer's hold their cards very close to their chest, pulling each one out very discretely, and only when they have you begging for more information. This created a good measure of suspense for me, but as I mentioned, the excessive time trailing after each punch - instead off winding up for the next one, deflated what should have been much better film. The ending is unexpected, but this made the film stand out from so many action- heavy losers it competed against in 2001.

1283054,5,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge is about man's inadequacy to explain and contain evil. It is in the Greek sense, a Classic Tragedy. The lead character, Jerry, is a detective whose professional life has been dedicated to methodically tracing and capturing bad guys. He was ""brilliant"" by his own colleagues' estimation. But when faced with true evil- the serial murder/rape of young girls- he finds himself lost, even as he applies his well-honed detective skills, building a growing body of circumstantial evidence and triangulating Evil's suspected whereabouts, placing himself right in the middle to ensure Evil's capture.

Jerry is a wise and cynical man, at the end of his career, having witnessed man's various depravities, scams, and failures. Over those years he also developed a deep compassion, distinguished apart from his insensitive colleagues and the reflexive flock-like mentality of society. But his compassion and intuition do not avail Jerry, and in fact backfire on him as his personal life progressively disintegrates the closer he seemingly gets to the culprit, eventually losing his friends and lover, who all become captive and subordinate to his obsession.

We cannot fault Jerry; his last case is simply out of his league. The mountainous landscape as a backdrop to the film serves to punctuate man's impotence in the face of Evil's basic structure within the timeless order of nature. Jerry's Pledge to capture Evil could only end in failure. Evil is larger than any of us. Any attempts to pursue and fathom Evil with our senses must lead to madness. Evil cannot be extinguished, nor even trapped, as Fate will deliver the means for Evil to escape and endure.

The plot is timeless and builds purposefully, the acting is superb, and the directing clean and modest with a few creative flourishes, alongside a poignant soundtrack and cinematography. 5 stars.",1300060800,,1860,5.172757475083056

Nicholson plays the role of a retired police officer who has made a pledge to track down the killer of a young girl.  The way he does that takes up most of the motion picture.  It is a psychological drama as he deals with his obsession.  You realize what he is doing, while the people around him do not.  His obsession eventually destroys friendships.  The story takes a major twist at the end, and you somehow feel that he has been left hanging.

1283059,4,B00003CXSH,"On the day of his retirement, Reno homicide cop Jack Nicholson investigates the brutal small-town murder of an eight-year-old girl and promises the distraught mother that he will find the killer. Seen fleeing the scene, retarded Indian Benicio Del Toro is apprehended the next day and confesses before killing himself in custody. It doesn't sit right with Nicholson, who delves into similar crimes unsolved in Nevada. Finding a link with two other cases, Nicholson baits a trap for a killer who might still be out there waiting to prey on young victims. Friedrich Durrenmatt's story It Happened in Broad Daylight has been filmed before as The Cold Light of Day, a 1995 Dutch film starring Richard E. Grant and set anonymously in eastern Europe. Sean Penn places his version precisely in the harsh landscape of the American West, the small town's clapboard buildings puny and inadequate in the shadow of the snow-peaked Sierras. Durrenmatt's schematic crime drama thus becomes more metaphysical character study than psycho-thriller, and in Nicholson's admirably restrained performance the obsessive detective is a noble melancholy loner, fascinating and deeply flawed. Good intentions, it seems, are sometimes not enough and Nicholson's sad character loses the plot. Penn calls his version The Pledge, but it could as well have been called The Secret. Nicholson unwisely keeps his counsel and it has devastating consequences for him as well as the mother, daughter and suspect. The only ones he tells the truth are his former colleagues on the force, and they don't believe him. The casting throughout is canny: Penn not only makes shrewdly judged use of the saturnine Del Toro's feral features but also puts Tom Noonan in a pivotal role. The softly spoken, apparently benign Noonan, of course, carries the imprint of his creepy depiction of Tooth Fairy serial-killer Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter, Michael Mann's masterful version of Red Dragon. In tone and bleak visual grandeur, Penn's picture resembles Paul Schrader's unforgiving film Affliction, and - as Nicholson rails in the wind against the random injustice of it all - it leaves a similarly haunting impression.",1237161600,,2173,5.265129682997118
1283129,5,B00003CXSH,"While The Pledge will never be included in anyone's list of favorite Jack Nicholson movies. It is none the less a finely crafted film, with great performances by Patricia Clarkson, Benicio Del Toro, Dale Dickey and of course Jack Nicholson. Kudos to Sean Penn for delivering this psychological thriller with such clearity and suspense. There's an erie undercurrent of mystery and intrigue throughout the movie that leaves one feeling unsettled right to the very end.

Having recently made several light comedies, (As Good As It Gets, About Schmidt and Somethings Gotta Give) all very good movies, Nicholson has had few dramatic roles of late that can compare with the great perfomances he gave us from Five Easy Pieces (1970) to A Few Good Men (1992). The Pledge (2001) is, in my opinion the last truly great dramatic performance he has done. While I'm certainly not writing him off, I sincerely hope Jack can find several more roles that challange his formitable skills at delivering rivoting and compelling dramatic performances.

To say I was overly distraught at the ending would be an understatement. After proving that he was correct in his assumptions in the case, contrary to the intense reluctance & near-ridicule of his former police mates, Nicholson has the audience on the edge of our seats rooting for the proof of his redemption, as well as the gratitude of the mother he made the initial promise to, and the mother who's little girl he was in the process of saving, when lo & behold, the whole thing just sort of falls apart with an all-too-convenient & seemingly nonsensical fatal vehicular accident, causing everything to seem like a figment of Nicholson's mind, subsequently ruining his life & turning him into a babbling alcoholic.

We were supposed to appreciate every second of their appearances. This style of film making went out with silverware in the Pullman car, but Sean Penn has brought it back here. We get a little of Vanessa Redgrave, a bit of Helen Mirren, a cameo from Mickey Rourke. This is a treat, admittedly, but it throws things off. Nicholson is trying is erase himself and these stars just throw a beam of light in his direction. The story seems rather textbook: the retiring cop who can't let go. The ""boys"" who thwart justice. The bully cop who'll do anything for a confession.  The cast is pure stock and trade stuff; in fact, we see much of this again in ""Mystic River."" It seems Penn's bag of tricks was found in the wardrobe department at RKO. There is nothing of interest in the narrative. He seems to have a thing for men protecting little girls from death.

A killer that has a distinct taste for little girls. **Possible Spoiler** But everyone thinks the killer is dead, except Nicholsons character.  So after his (semi)retirement, he goes in search of the killer, in a low key fashion.  He befriends a pitiful lady played by Robin Wright Penn.  She does very well herself.  She has a daughter, that fits that distinct taste for young girls the killer has.  The story unfolds from there.  It's not  your typical cat & mouse movie.

It is one thing to be melancholy when there is a point to be made or human aspect worth exploring.  The sole purpose of this film, however, appears to be the infliction of the writer and director's morose outlook on the human condition.

The plot of the film takes forever to develop, then goes nowhere.  The characters are not at all engaging, and the filmaking is a disjointed mess.

1283217,4,B00003CXSH,"There is a scene about twenty minutes into the film where Jack Nicholson's character, a detective literally about to retire, elects to tell the unsuspecting parents of young girl that she has been the victim of a brutal murder. The parents own a chicken coup. The camera work of the inside of the coup, with the chickens, each seemingly walking around in his/her own world until some unexpected sound or vibration grabs their attention and they notice one another, is poetry of the highest order. A chicken is picked out from amongst the crowd by the neck and looked at. This one will make a fine roast, you can almost hear the person picking it up saying to themselves.

The scene is sublime poetry because for the brief moments the chickens are focused on they seem to take on human characteristics...it's as if you are staring at the collective personality of a busy street corner in New York during rush hour. And the picking of one chicken (who will of course disappear, never to be seen again), which may be the product of careful study, etc. seems to be, coming from the other chickens' point of view, completely random--and simultaneously incomprehensible.

This scene is the entire movie encapsulated. It carries with it the incomprehensible pain of being human in a world routinely struck by what seems on the surface to be the random acts of an incomprehensible violence, but, like a chaos theory, has its own sad, hidden and inhumane logic lodged deep within.

Sean Penn's directing in this film is a triumph on many levels. Jack Nicholson's work of trying to catch a serial killer--and losing himself in the process--is superior. And yet as many others have said, the character work of others is equally compelling, making this masterful ensemble film a profound experience: Benicio del Toro as a mentally ill Native American whose mind is weak, but whose broken heart full of regret and fear is acute; Mickey Rourke as a grieving father has one scene in the entire movie that is Oscar worthy; Robin Wright Penn makes you completely forget there are any actors in this movie at all.

And the screenplay stands toe to toe with them all and becomes part of the masterful ensemble. Nicholson says to his old boss in one scene ""I made a promise...you're old enough to remember when that meant something."" And yet the entire movie stands as a testament to the complicated nature of human existence that makes it obvious some promises were made to be broken.

He pledges to the little girl's parents that he'll bring in the killer.

He then goes off on his retirement, sort of, but he doesn't forget his pledge and soon is on the trail of his killer again. Or is he?

Nicholson is so low-key that at times he feels barely alive. The story is an interesting one, though it loses focus, or at least the sharpness needed, along the way in places.

He will investigate this case till its last consequences, but the fate will make its bitter appearance to eliminate his brilliant deduction, leaving him with the infinite doubt and giving the most of people (the reason?) that proved once more he was not the most indicate man to resolve this murder.

1283223,1,B00003CXSH,"I once knew a 13-year-old kid who decided to enter a short story contest by writing a piece of fiction about a bank robbery.

The story was pretty simple and straightforward. Four disaffected teenagers want to buy a car and drive out to California, but they don't have any money. One thing leads to another, and they rob a bank, using toy guns. They buy a car, drive to California, and live on the beach near Santa Monica, having completed the perfect caper.

Once the kids get to California, the story ended, sort of like this: ""One day they were crossing the street and everybody got run over by a truck. The End.""

Needless to say, ""The"" Ending for ""The Pledge"" is a lot like that. Otherwise, the story isn't bad, and the acting certainly isn't bad. Personally, I liked the direction and cinematography.

How entertaining is it? I'll put it this way - I was interested enough that I watched the thing all the way through, which is an acheivement in itself.  Watching Jack Nicholson play the same character from ""The Shining"" over and over and over again is tiring.

1283224,4,B00003CXSH,"""The Pledge"" is the newest film directed by Sean Penn and stars Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances. It is also a film that Penn wants to tell at his own pace, a slow, laborious pace, which often threatens to take the film down with it.

Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), is a detective with the Reno, Nevada police department about to retire. His boss (Sam Shepard) and his replacement (Aaron Eckhart) are called away from the retirement party to deal with a new homicide. Jerry asks to ride along, even though he is six hours away from retirement. What they find is an eight year old blond girl who has been raped and killed, dumped in the snow up near a rural Nevada town. The local police are sickened by the crime and have difficulty dealing with it. The task of informing the parents eventually falls to Jerry. The grief stricken mother (Patricia Clarkson) makes Jerry promise to find the killer. He does. As he is set to leave on his retirement trip, a deep sea fishing trip paid for by people in the department, he has second thoughts and returns to the case.

For the first half of the film, Nicholson investigates the murder, visiting a series of suspects or people that may be involved or able to help with the case. These people are played by an impressive array of character actors, but their roles are very small. This provides Nicholson with a showcase. Nicholson's Jerry Black is a man that is happier when working and doesn't relish the thought of retirement. This isn't portrayed in his usual bombastic way. Nicholson plays Black quietly, making him real, making him human. He could be a real detective on the police force. He shows a lot of emotion with his face, indicating when he is unhappy, frightened, disgusted, pleased, content. This is a far cry from the Nicholson we are used to watching. Believe me, it is a welcome sight to watch Nicholson become a real human being rather than a character become Nicholson.

""The Pledge"" is about Jerry Blacks' journey to find the killer. He questions the girl's grandmother (Vannesa Redgrave), enlists the aid of a child psychologist (Helen Mirren), and watches the questioning of a suspect, a mentally challenged Indian (Benicio Del Toro, in his third film role in one month).

At one point, Jerry shows a drawing the child did to his former boss (Shepard) . Claiming the giant drawn in the picture is the killer, Black effectively alienates the department he previously worked for. Unable to turn up new leads, he ends up buying a gas station in a small town from it's tired owner (Harry Dean Stanton). Soon, he meets an abused woman (Robin Wright Penn) and her daughter and takes them in.

""The Pledge"" works as a character study, and at times, the slow pace of the film help it seem all the more authentic. Penn creates some magnificent, moody set pieces, but ultimately, the film becomes too slow for its own good. In the first hour, Penn creates an entirely believable retirement party in a run down casino restaurant. The investigation scenes in the snowy drifts are also very believable. In the second hour, when the journey becomes more personal, I enjoyed watching the way events unfolded, but I know many people were bored by the pace. Penn falls into the trap of including too many lingering shots of things. I get it. This is the way life is in this town, in this area, but it doesn't help the story in the long run.

I also enjoyed the ending. It seemed more authentic than most conventional thrillers. But again, I think it left a lot of people in the dark and in the cold.

There are some problems with ""The Pledge"" beyond it's pacing. The impressive list of character actors was welcome, but their roles were more distracting than anything else. Each is featured for about five minutes before Black moves on. Five minutes of Helen Mirren? She's always great, but I wanted more of her. Also, her role doesn't seem to advance the story at all. Likewise, Vanessa Redgrave. She merely reiterates that the victim was very sweet and innocent. However, the victim's mother already impressed this upon us. I guess, in a way, her character does play a bigger part in the overall film, but only indirectly. Harry Dean Stanton has literally four lines. It reminded me of some of the celebrities who appear in Woody Allen's films. Some of the celebrities are featured in large, substantial parts. Some have what basically amounts to a walk-on. These roles are walk-ons. Benicio Del Toro creates another vivid character, who has a large part in the overall mystery. In the last month, we have seen three films with Del Toro, each of which has proven that he is a very, very good actor.

I think you will find Nicholson's performance in ""The Pledge"" worth the price of admission alone. Hopefully, you will not be put off by the slow pace or challenging ending.",1113350400,,4835,4.660023446658851

1283356,5,B00003CXSH,"One of 2001's most underappreciated films, The Pledge is a very unforgiving and dark examination of the consequences of promises that cannot be kept. The brutal murder of children is a chilling and horrendous subject matter but Sean Penn directs the film with great restraint and intelligence. We hear about the crimes and occasionally see some grisly photos (reason enough for the film to receive an ""R"" rating in Australia) but no actual violence is shown. The result is horrific enough to make most of the film especially uncomfortable but gripping viewing.

Rather than being a straightforward mystery thriller (there are moments of intense and gutwrenching suspense, particularly the scene where Nicholson is racing to the church, you'll know when you see it), this is a bleak but rewarding character study of an obsession that goes too far. Sean Penn's last two films were about redemption, this one goes in an opposite direction resulting in an ending that has divided many people. I actually loved it as it stays and stays with you long after the film has finished. It's cinematically unsatisfying and frustratingly ambiguous but it didn't stop bothering me. A more conventional, audience friendly ending would have lent the film a great disservice since the screenplay is so well written and main characters so well established with their moral dilemnas, especially Jack Nicholson's Jerry Black, one of the more complex and compelling characters that he has ever played. Nicholson's performance greatly compliments Penn's direction; its his least showy, least hammy and best acting performance ever. He seems utterly convincing as a retired cop possibly descending into insanity.

The Pledge also benefits greatly from one of Hans Zimmer's (along with Klaus Badelt)most haunting soundtracks, perfectly establishing the mood of beauty and danger in the Nevada settings. Not only is Sean Penn a great actor but after this film, he could well go onto becoming a formidable filmaker. The Pledge is a brave film that deserves a better audience than it has received and proof that not all really good films need to have cut and paste characters, a predictable plot and neat, tidy ending.",1104364800,4,2190,5.166197183098592

Unwilling to leave the job to the slipshod young upstarts looking to move the crime to the ""solved"" list, Jerry antagonizes his former colleagues as he continues to investigate the crime post-retirement, despite the apparent confession and suicide of a retarded Native American. His obsession combines with his relationship with a battered single mother and her young daughter, and his resulting lapses in judgment lead to near tragedy for all, true tragedy for Jerry. Nicholson avoids the ""over the top"" stuff he is well-known (and loved) for, delivering a Jerry Black who is simultaneously depressed, hopeful, obsessed, and loving, all at a time most men hope will be their ""golden years."" The juxtaposition of the splendorous, pristine Sierras in the background and the seedy, violent ""civilization"" Jerry moves through make for a sincere and accurate depiction of much of the modern American West. The performances are uniformly excellent, right down to the young boy who discovers the murdered girl in the opening scene. The final scene is so thought-provoking as to make the viewer question whether the ""resolution"" is real or merely Jerry's attempt to rationalize what went ""wrong.""

1283359,5,B00003CXSH,"The ending of this movie, of which we see glimpses in the beginning, is an example of the sort of cosmic irony that some world-renown writers apply to human affairs.  It is not the sort of thing usually seen in a movie of course, since the mass mind at which most movies are directed will find it dissatisfying, even irritating.

The world-renowned author responsible for the ending of this tale of a retired cop on the trail of a serial killer of blond little girls in red dresses is none other than Swiss novelist and playwright Friedrich Drrenmatt who wrote the novel from which the screen play was adapted.

The ""pledge"" in the title is that of just-retiring Reno, Nevada cop Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) who is not convinced that a confession by a mentally-disturbed Native American, played convincingly by Benicio Del Toro, is genuine.  Jerry Black gives his word to the mother of the murdered little girl that he will find the killer.  However, he is no longer on the force and gets only intermittent help from his colleagues who think he has gone a little daffy.  Nicholson, as usual, totally becomes the character he is playing and gives an outstanding performance.  He is assisted by Aaron Eckhart who plays the detective who got the ""confession,"" and by Robin Wright Penn who plays Lori, the mother of another little girl.

The direction by Sean Penn is uncluttered, focused and visually astute.  For example, note the way the little girl playing in the swings between the highway and the gas station affects our expectation of what is to come.  Penn also captures well the high country atmosphere around Reno, Nevada and attendant lifestyles, and for the most part keeps his auteur ambitions secondary to the telling of the story.  The script by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski is artistically true with crisp, direct dialogue and a fine dramatic structure.  The film is also nicely cut so that everything is clear without any belaboring of the obvious.  Some of the set scenes as Jerry Black interviews the grandmother of the slain little girl (Vanessa Redgrave in a cameo) and then a psychiatrist (..., who is just perfect in her experienced skepticism) are very well done.  Most importantly though, Penn did not give in to those who would demand a commercial ending over an artistic one.  And for this he paid the price, since this film was not well-received by the mass audience.

Of course it is impossible to discuss the ending without giving away too much, but I think we can safely say that in real life sometimes chance and fate (if you will) step in and change things dramatically which makes us see our limitations and realize that some of what happens to us is beyond our control.  I think that is what happened to Jerry Black and Lori; yet notice, too, that it is integral to Jerry Black's character and all that he has been all his life for him to make the insensitive mistake that he does.

Incidentally the ending can be fixed in a sequel...  Well, that is not likely to happen since this was NOT a box office success.  Only box office successes get to be sequels--which somehow (bizarrely) reminds me of the line from the old Charlie the Tuna TV commercial: ""Only good-tasting tunas get to be Starkist.""

For those who are wondering who really did kill the little girls, I will give you a hint: he got his just deserts in a symbolically appropriate manner.

Bottom line: a fine artistic achievement, an excellent diversion, and a treat for those who are fed up with films that play out in a tiresome, predictable manner.",1095811200,16,3562,4.720516962843296

What would lead Jerry Black to do such a monstrous thing as bait a trap with a child he loves? Obsession, maybe. Madness impending. Desperation to stop a monster in its tracks? Whatever: It's killin me.
I have small children. Since starting my family I have steered pretty clear of movies involving child-centered violence or violation, but the lure of Penn and Nicholson got the better of me.

Sean Penn lets the story unfold artistically, not giving away to much so we are surprised at what happens next. It is not a happy upbeat film and seems to be mainly a character study of a retired police cop, who really has not ever had a intimate relationship with anyone and hasn't gotten close enough to make friends with anybody in his force. They know him and respect him, yet there isn't that really cool camaraderie which goes with being really important to someone. The theme revolves around child sexual abuse and homicide, not a pretty picture. Jerry, Nicholson, becomes obsessed with the case and makes a pledge to the mother that he will find the killer. Intuitively, he knows that the wrong person got nabbed. A virtuoso performance by Del Toro and Eckerson. A real creepy confession, another artful turn by the director to take us off the beaten path. Jerry pledges to find the truth out and things seem to be going good, until a turn of fate, causing the cookie to crumble, a matter of speaking, I don' want to divulge to much, the cookie is Jerry.

It draws you into the mystery like a Hitchcock film, as it mesmerizes and enchants like Atom Egyoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter"".  Nicholson is far too often typecast as an abrasive maverick and in this film he is able to show off another side of his acting skills.  Also, Penn has come a long way since the days of Sonic Youth's aptly titled ""Crucifixion of Sean Penn"".  However...there were ways of ending this film in a non-mainstream way without resorting to cheap tactics.  Just having everything cave in for the hero in the final moment is generally not an effective literary device, not much better than everything suddenly turning out great for the hero, as is often done in Holywood.  The main conflict is keeping his pledge without putting the family at risk.  It would have been better if he did capture and kill the serial killer, but in the crossfire the girl got injured and the mother dumped him as a result.  That way he could have had the satisfaction of being right, but would also have been penalized for putting the girl in danger and not being honest with the mother.  The film could then have had a bitter sweet ending that better suited the theme.  He would have been forced to sacrifice his love of a family for higher justice and the viewers would have been left with a lot of material for discussion about the moral dilema he faced.  It seems like Penn just wanted Nicholson to look like Gene Hackman in ""The Conversation"" sitting there in his dismantled room playing his sax in a state of dishelvelment and paranoia.",1078185600,,1636,4.606896551724138

1283481,5,B00003CXSH,"Jack Nicholson. Sean Penn. Benicio Del Toro. These three names alone will bring mainstream viewers to this film; however 90% of them will be expecting Hollywood and 90% will walk away from this film because they have just watched something closer to art-house cinema than the A-list Hollywood affair that it promotes.
The Pledge is akin to watching something like Dead Man Walking minus the Hollywood plot devices or Spike Lee's Summer of Sam without the pace. It certainly is not like Silence of the Lambs, Seven or Psycho as some have been thinking. If your expectations are Hollywood, then forget it. You will only be disappointed. If you are looking for a serial killer film that moves in a more realistic fashion with non-mainstream plot elements then The Pledge will deliver.
There are a number of things that make this film different. Nicholson's character is more obsessive and paranoid but keeps his cool for the most part of this film. He also befriends a woman half his age and this is not your typical Hollywood bonding. The actual investigation of the serial killings is more or less played out in a very realistic way, often boring and never really seems to amount to much. The crime evidence is hard to obtain and the investigation leads are miniscule (as with most real-life cases). For this reason Nicholson's character is mostly trying to grasp at straws which leaves him on the ignore list at his former police department. In retirement he buys a filling station and tags cars that he believes could be connected with the crimes. The crimes themselves are brutal and VERY GRAPHIC. There are a number of scenes depicting child murders that are very disturbing.
The film's realism is what makes it so good. It is slow and often may seem boring, but this is daring and the director should be appreciated for not doing what WE HAVE SEEN A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE. The fact is that most serial killer flicks are clichd driven but here Penn takes us on a very different journey from a lot of different angles. In short, this film is much closer to a real-life hunt for a serial killer than any other mainstream Hollywood murder mystery flick.
The ending will annoy some, but personally I love it. I think that the ending is very suitable for the material at hand because in most cases serial killers, who are not caught, are either - dead/have gone insane/have been locked up for another unrelated crime. So this film really does play out the realism very well. I also like the fact that certain plot elements are left unknown to many of the characters. This is a very good character device and you do not see that done very often.
This is a very original movie that stays on rational ground. The scene where the cops decide to tell the parents of a dead girl what has happened is absolutely one of the most troubling things any human being can do and it is just done so well in this movie. I can not see how this film fails to engage anyone with a heart. This is a touching film - a touching journey into the darker crossings in life that some do go through.

The cast is also misleading to potential audience: we've got the names of Del Toro and Rourke: they appear briefly, no more than four minutes, probably paying some kind of favor to Penn.

Aside from the being irrelevant and a rather ham-handed attack at the film's detractors, that is beside the point.  Clearly, the Pledge has some high concepts and ambitions, but the story it tells fails in providing coherent characters, as well a muddled story line.
What, then, is the ultimate message?  Is it that life's circumstances can go irrationally, tragically wrong?  That a man's ""pledge"" (an ill-advised one at that), despite being borne of the noblest motives (it appears), can result in a life spiralling out of control and leading to alcoholic psychosis?  Frankly, we never learn enough about any of the characters to understand their motives, and while some of the acting performances resonate with potential (Benecio Del Toro in particular), they are arranged in a sloppy jigsaw.

Jerry Black (played magnificantly by Jack Nickolson) is on the trail of a killer that has brutally murdered an innocent young girl. He makes a ""Pledge"" to the mother of the victim to find the murderer and you can tell that when Black makes a promise he keeps it.
When watching this film, keep an open mind. Unlike many other movies a formalaic script does not exsist here. This film is a study of real life and the pain that goes along with trying ones best and having the results not come out the way one hoped (tragically portrayed in the last 3rd of this film).

1283486,5,B00003CXSH,"After seeing and musing the import of this movie I have determined primarily that Nicholson is the consummate actor. Jack may be a nut or a tad eccentric in real life but he's no Roman Polanski....

The reason I gave the title of my review the fourteen textual units is this simple equation: honorable cops care. Or shall I say--redoundingly perhaps--those cops, those persons that don't become corrupt politicians (generally, upper echelon), felons, or suicidal/alcohol/drug-infused, stupefied meltdowns.

Most honorable cops consider the 'career' an admirable profession: unlike the 'jobs' that the rabble that comprise our rapidly, exponentially impelled; otherwise imploding, third-world simplistic mentality society.

What I mean by this statement is, many honorable policeman consider [all that it entails] the profession to be a supreme distinction to throw their lives in the face of danger to persons unknown to them: regardless of status. Sure, it is an ideal. When is the last time a true hero (not the many shrinking violets) of today's proceedings accomplished this?

Cowards comprise many aspects of today's proceedings: mettle or courage is scarce.

I have often said that our creator could place an ""angel"" in uniform [in many of our large American cities today] and they would become corrupted with the continual onslaught of the rancid black bile of personally targeted human malice: Goodness, decency, and integrity from a policeman's perspective is rare indeed.

Nicholson's character contends with what I just alluded to, albeit on a smaller yet more intimate scale. His character embarks on the very personal mission to find a killer: A promise made.

As depicted by this movie, the price of justice is often horrific. One mans horrendous yet overly due death is also the demise of a shining example of the relentless pursuit of the notion of justice. The allegorical death of a decent soul ruined by the excursion is the aftermath.

Buy this movie, watch it, and think deeply about the unfairness of this game called life. Comprehend the concept of an honorable thin-blue-line separating the malaise from you. Evil in all forms wins most of the time.

However, I realize far too many dolts (one is too many), simply don't care until tragedy strikes directly at ones' door . . .

By then it is too late.

I use the word honorable several times within this review. The movie sadly alludes to the narrative. Many police training programs fail (or is it parenting?) to stress the importance of the word. Or is it the system? What I mean, is the system so rigged (the rich getting off, the revolving door of the justice system, political favors to the connected, corrupt administrations, politicians as policeman rather than honorable servants and on and on), tainting the idealistic view of the person donning the badge and compelling corruption?

It is a totally engrossing film that will take you on a dark journey of the soul, the soul of one retired detective seeking justice he believes was not served , and at the same time battling his inner demons of loneliness and obsessions.
What makes great actors? actors whose speech or expressions will stay with the viewer for a long time? It is their ability to totally be the character without visible effort or 'acting', and at the same time, pulling the viewers with them into the world they have created.
Jack Nicholson is one such actor..How many of us still remember that manic face with these immortal words 'Here's Johnny' in The Shinning? or the hard military man under interrogation in A Few Good Men, or the eccentric and sad world of Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, I think many..
In the Pledge, Nicholson manages it again, offering a very powerful performance worthy of any award..His anguish, loneliness, obsession to find the 'killer' while at the same time trying very hard to cope with his retirement and finding his peace of mind, these elements are interwined and part and parcel of the person he has become, and the failure of any will fail the other, and hence his final deterioration.
Although the film is about the killer/killing, and some of the crime scenes are very harrowing, (I am surprised how they passed the censor's normally twitchy fingers), it becomes more of a character psychological study of a man on the verge of collapse..We enter inside Nicholson's mind, and we see his suspicions and increasing tortured soul, and we too become uncertain as to the identity of the killer..can it be the one that the police initially caught and who killed himself at the station (an excellent Del Toro), or another man like Nicholson strongly believes? It does not matter at the end.
It is not about catching the killer anymore, and more about the failure of an old frustrated cop to seek his personal redemption.
The mood is slow, but never boring, rather reflecting perfectly the mood of a retired but gradually obsessed Nicholson.
Like Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn proves that he is an excellent director, doing a wonderful job behind the camera, and not only he is an actor's director, but quite visual too, as the cinematography is top class,and the scenery breathtaking (Penn allows time to linger on it inan almost meditative eye).
The score is haunting and complements the scenes perfectly.
And the amount of top actors in small supporting roles is very interesting and adds a lot of weight to the film: Del Toro, Mikey Rourke (in a very short but well acted scene)Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and Helen Mirren, whose character as a psychologist offers the viewer the first hint of Nicholson's tortured existence in a very memorable scene.

1283581,4,B00003CXSH,"This moody, brooding character study examines how intuition born of a lifetime's work can lead to unhealthy obsession, the effects of which, in the end, can ultimately render the basis for it irrelevant, especially when particular circumstances are introduced that serve to derail the initial focus and prevent the possibility of a tenable resolution.  ""The Pledge,"" directed by Sean Penn, is an incisive, probing drama of a driven man who is psychologically and emotionally incapable of letting go of an event that-- in his mind, at least-- remains unresolved.  And it explores that aspect of human nature that, in certain individuals, at any rate, refuses to allow disregard of even a perceived infraction of justice; it's a matter of being imbued with a kind of innate moral code and being obliged to follow it-- regardless of where it may lead.
Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) of the Reno P.D. has come to the end of an illustrious career; it's time to pull the pin and go fishing.  But Jerry's retirement party is interrupted by the report of the brutal murder of a young girl, whose body has just been found in the woods.  Officially, Jerry only has six hours left on the clock, but he insists on being a part of the investigation.  And it's a decision that is ultimately going to have a decided effect on the rest of his life; not only because of the heinousness of the crime, which creates the kind of image that will forever haunt even a seasoned professional like Jerry, but because Jerry makes a promise to Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson), the bereaved mother of the murdered girl, that the individual responsible will be found and brought to justice.
Jerry's life takes an irreversible turn, however, when a suspect is apprehended and charged with the crime, but prevailing circumstances and Jerry's intuition lead him to believe they have the wrong man.  By the cold light of the next morning, though, Jerry is retired, and the case is no longer his concern; but justice, and the promise he made to the girl's mother still is, and whether he wants it or not, Jerry's involvement with this case is going to follow him into retirement.  No matter where he goes or what he does, it will always be a part of him, a constant companion.  And sooner or later, it's something that is going to have to be resolved, with or without the help and resources of the department to which he dedicated so much of his life.  One way or another, Jerry-- responding to some subconscious impetus-- is going to solve this case, and he's going to do it his way, and to his satisfaction.  Until then, in his mind anyway, this case is still ""open,"" and will remain so, until he deems otherwise and the forces compelling him at last subside.  And leave him in peace.
As an actor, Sean Penn has demonstrated a range and depth of emotion that at times fairly implodes (as with his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet in ""Dead Man Walking""), and with such strength that the outward reverberations of it have a decided impact on the film.  And his subtle approach as a director has the same effect here.  His studied presentation and deliberate pace creates an underlying tension that runs through the film like a wire being slowly drawn tighter and tighter until it is taut to the point of breaking, and his hand is constantly on that wire, controlling it-- allowing it some slack to effect a false sense of security, for example, before snapping! it back again, and making the drama of the story riveting in a way that definitely keeps the attention of the audience.  He attaches you to Jerry Black as he quietly leads him through a field of emotional land mines, and it keeps you involved; indeed, as a viewer, you have no choice, and like Jerry, you have no respite from the situation, which enables you to relate to Jerry on a very personal level.  And that connection is reinforced further by Jerry's involvement with a single mother, Lori (Robin Wright Penn), a waitress at a local diner; and as their friendship evolves, Penn twists that wire even more, and the tension escalates.  This is commendable work by Penn, who has taken a basically good story (the screenplay is by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski, based on the book by Friedrich Durrenmatt) to a higher level and turned it into a penetrating, insightful drama.
The combination of Penn and Jack Nicholson makes for an effective collaboration, in that Nicholson approaches his character, Jerry, with that same sense of reflective introspection that Penn brings to the film as director.  And it works splendidly; Nicholson creates a character who is always seemingly on the edge, and you can feel that ever present tension and sense of discontent that defines who Jerry really is and what he's all about.  On a certain level, Nicholson's portrayal is reminiscent in attitude and perspective of the character he created so memorably in ""Ironweed,"" Francis Phelan.  This is a guy who plays the game of life with a perpetual poker face on; he maintains a reserved countenance that belies the constant roiling going on behind his eyes.  And the fact that Nicholson can convey all of this so well, even in his (or Jerry's) most guarded moments, is what makes his performance so powerful and convincing.  He plays it entirely from the inside out, and the result is an absorbing, unforgettable character.
The supporting cast includes Benicio Del Toro (Wadenah), Vanessa Redgrave (Annalise), Sam Shepard (Eric), Aaron Eckhart (Sam), Mickey Rourke (Jim) and Tom Noonan (Gary).  Sean Penn has a way of telling a story that is uniquely his own, and it's that distinction that sets ""The Pledge,"" apart and makes it so engaging.  This isn't a ""throw-away popcorner,"" but one you're going to want to mull over for awhile after the screen has gone dark.",1027296000,,5804,4.793587174348698
1283582,1,B00003CXSH,"Yikes!  Who convinced Nicholson that was a good script?  Jack and Sean must be drinking buddies, because Jack would never have agreed to taint his name with this one sober.
I have seen more than one director talk about the pain of having to cut scenes out of a picture to meet time restrictions.  This leads me to believe that the nature of movie making is make the film much longer than you think it needs to be, then trim the extra bits, leaving only the most important aspects.  This monstrosity views like it originally panned out to about fifteen minutes, and then spliced in two hours of fishing scenes to fluff it up.  No offence to Bill Dance and his fans, but if I wanted to watch fishing, I would turn on The Nashville Network.
The directing is mawkish, the cinematography is boring, the music stinks, and the story itself is filled with one anti-climax after another, until we reach the ultimate unfullfilling anticlimax, about an anti-hero, in what should have been an anti-movie.

It's close to a traditional detective movie, with much suspense.  Where it deviates from a traditional detective movie is that it's more of a character study of the detective.  Jack Nicholson, who I am not crazy about, plays the role of a retired detective perfectly.

1283585,3,B00003CXSH,"I was first drawn to this film because it was filmed largely on location in and around the Okanagan-Similkameen region of British Columbia, where I live. Others in town who watched the film, partly for the same reasons, I suspect, were disappointed with it. I certainly, then, did not have my hopes set too high when I rented out this movie. I am pleased to say, then, that this film had a depth I did not expect, so I was not wholly disappointed.
Sean Penn's psychological drama, set within the framework of a suspense thriller (though he eventually ties himself loose from many of the expected conventions), begins looking like a standard cop movie, with the exception of the opening credits, which give a taste of what is later to come. The first forty minutes or so has nothing to distinguish it from an episode of Law and Order, following a fairly hackneyed format: Nicholson is the retiring cop, fretting about life outside the force, who takes on one last case - a child murder - on his way out. All in all, this first section of the film is rather lacklustre.
In one crucial scene, from the events of which the film takes its title, Nicholson vows to the murdered girl's mother that he will find her child's killer and bring him to justice, swearing by his own soul's salvation that he will do so. Thus the stage is set, albeit in a pretentious manner that could hardly have been executed less obliquely, for a story in which Nicholson becomes redeemer, setting off on a quest to redeem his own self, bereft of purpose in life, and be saviour to a grieving couple bereft of their only daughter.
It is from this point on that Penn starts to work outside of the conventions, and blazes a trail full of ambiguities and questions as Nicholson makes it his ambition to find the child-killer. The ambiguity that characterizes every turn of the plot is suggested by the opening titles, and is reintroduced when Nicholson makes his pledge. Who is he doing it for? What motivates him? At opposite poles, we have his own sense of bereavement and angst in the event of his retirement, and the emotional reaction to seeing a murdered girl and her distraught parents. Is this about Nicholson, about the girl, or about the grieving parents? Or is it wider? We are given other reasons throughout the film that might motivate him and give a more expansive scope to his mission. This sort of incertitude is typical of the tone of the rest of the film.
Ultimately, we are left none the wiser. Understandably, appetites accustomed to the standard Hollywood fare are left unsatiated by Penn's conclusion. We discover that Nicholson's existential quest to save himself and, in the process, save others, is a failure. And, indeed, we wonder whether all attempts to find salvation are similarly doomed. God and religion are treated no more favourably as solutions to the search for meaning than Nicholson's own attempts at salvation. As we watch Nicholson's descent into madness and frustration, we are get the uneasy feeling that all search for meaning and redemption is inevitably futile, and bound to lack of resolution.
Perhaps, though, the film was intended merely to provoke such questions, rather than necessarily answer them. After all, so many questions are thrown up unanswered throughout the film that one can't possibly go away from The Pledge without reeling from the puzzles and riddles presented. The uncertainties of Penn's film reflect the wider ambiguities of human existence and endeavour, and it is those uncertainties that the viewer will leave thinking about.
Nicholson turns in a great performance, as usual. The location filming is beautiful (I say that with an element of bias, of course), and the film is visually compelling. The haunting score, when it avoids cliches at the hands of veteran composer Hans Zimmer, complements the film's visual beauty.",1023753600,,3863,4.836858006042296
1283685,3,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge, directed by Sean Penn, is very well filmed and acted. Unlike most Hollywood movies, it doesn't talk down to the audience but instead is challenging and full of depth. On the negative side, however, the main character's actions don't really make sense and by the end of the film there's no sense of ""Ah, now I get it,"" or ""Well, I don't understand but at least it's thought-provoking..""  Instead, you're left with a sort of ""Huh?"" feeling at the end, not unlike opening up a nicely wrapped gift and finding it empty inside.
SPOILER - The main plot is that Jack Nicholson is a cop who is only hours away from retiring when he gets pulled into a horrific case, in which a young girl has been sexually abused, tortured, and murdered. Jack promises the girl's parents that he will find the killer and so, even though he's supposed to be retired now, Jack becomes obsessed with the case.
So far, so good.
Where the movie begins to lose me is that Jack then meets a single mother with a daughter and he invites them to come live with them. Time passes. Lots of time. Lots and lots of time. He loves them both, so what does he do? He uses the daughter as bait to catch the killer.
And that's where the film begins to lose me. I just didn't buy it. I know he made a promise to the parents of the dead girl and all of that, but I just couldn't buy that he would repeatedly, deliberately, set up his own 8-year-old step-daughter (of sorts) to be abducted. Additionally, by the end Jack is suddenly completely insane, babbling to himself for no reason. The transformation is far too abrupt to be believable, though.

Many viewers may feel disappointed, but that will be chiefly due to their narrow-mindedness. You'd think they'd never seen an independant film. Cheers to Sean Penn for avoiding the cliches.

1283689,3,B00003CXSH,"The first time we got a look at Sean Penn was twenty years ago in the outrageous hit comedy, Fast Times at Ridgemont High. He played a high school student whose main pursuits were surf boarding and pot smoking. His was one of the great breakthrough performances. Still, who would have thought he would become not only one of the world's premiere serious actors, but also a fine director? The Pledge is his latest directorial tour de force, and, like his previous efforts, it is heavy stuff. Some viewers will love it for the very reasons that others will hate it.
Jerry Black [Jack Nicholson] is about to retire as a detective for the Reno, Nevada police department. He is looking forward to doing a lot of fishing. On his last day, the body of a brutally murdered little girl is discovered. The prime suspect is an Indian [Benicio Del Toro] with mental problems. During an interrogation, he confesses, but Jerry, who is watching the process on a closed circuit TV, thinks something is fishy about it. He doesn't believe the suspect has the capacity to know what he is confessing to. A little later, the Indian grabs a deputy's gun and kills himself. To the department, the case is now closed, but Jerry swore on his soul to the victim's mother that justice would prevail. He doesn't give up, even though he is now retired. During his investigation, he discovers two unsolved murders that are very similar to the first case. He pinpoints an area near which the killer may live. He actually moves to the area and even meets a woman [Robin Wright Penn] he falls in love with. He also becomes attached to her small daughter, but ultimately it his obsession with solving the crime that rules him.
This is Nicholson's best role in some time, and he is supported by a remarkable cast. Some of these players have just one scene, but each of them still brings a power that the movie might not otherwise have had.
After the first thirty minutes, The Pledge breaks from traditional formula. It turns out that Jerry may be simply confused by years of cynical police work, bad relationships and heavy drinking. He finds a suspect, but he is the only one who finds the man suspicious. To prove his theory, will he go to any lengths? Will he even put his lover's daughter in harm's way? Is he really committed to the victim's mother, or was he a cop so long that he doesn't know how to stop being one? The movie is full of such questions, as well as ambiguities, and this is much of what makes it different. The movie knows that in life there are few pat answers. It can be a long road from assumptions to the truth. The Pledge mirrors life more than most other movie do, and this is what will make some people love it and others hate it.",1016150400,2,2724,4.482897384305835

1283692,4,B00003CXSH,"Vaguely reminiscent in tone to Paul Schrader's movie `Affliction', The Pledge is Sean Penn's third outing as a Director.  As with his previous work it is very much a study of human beings, their strengths their weaknesses and their flaws. Beautifully photographed, it is also morally ambiguous and ultimately downbeat portrayal of a good man obsessed with fulfilling a promise and unable to let go of the past in his attempt to give his life meaning.
Opening with an unkempt Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) apparently rambling incoherently to himself, the rest of the movie is told in flashback, with Jerry returning from a fishing trip and about to start his last day as a police detective. However, when a young boy witnesses a retarded native American man (Beniccio Del Torro) fleeing in the snow and subsequently discovers the body of a young girl, who has been brutally raped and murdered, Jerry, despite his imminent retirement, promises the distraught parents that he will catch whomever is responsible. Later Jerry refuses to believe the murder is an open and shut case, carrying on his own investigation even when the officer in charge of the investigation (Aaron Eckhart) is only too keen to blame it on the now deceased Indian.
Jack Nicholson (who previously collaborated with Sean Penn, on the also excellent Crossing Guard) delivers one of his finest performances, in his subtle portrayal of a good man trying to keep a promise but at a personal cost. And whilst this is far from the type of feel good movie such as `As Good As It Gets' that won him his last Best Actor  Oscar, this is in my opinion a far superior movie and a far superior performance, in that although this haunting movie will not send you to bed with your faith in the human spirit restored, it will make you think and stay with you for much longer than any of your typical Hollywood fare. Also excellent is the supporting cast, especially including a cast against type dowdy single mother, Robin Wright Penn, as well as Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Beniccio Del Torro, Helen Mirren and Tom Noonan.
The Pledge is a disturbing film  but it is beautifully filmed and for this praise must be directed toward Chris Menges (Local Hero) for his beautiful cinematography. Admittedly this is an uncommercial and slow paced movie which certainly won't be to everyone's taste and although some people will be critical of his at times somewhat ponderous style of directing, Sean Penn (dir. The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard) subtly allows his actors to shine.  Penn is as far as I'm concerned, one of America's finest character actors but he can surely now add to his resume the title of, one of America's great young film directors and I highly recommend this very intelligent movie (though clearly it will fly over many peoples heads).",1013212800,4,2811,4.825726141078838
1283693,3,B00003CXSH,"Child endangerment has always struck me as rather questionable source material for adult thrillers  particularly when that threat takes the form of child rape and murder.  The Pledge wallows in the muck of the subject matter a bit much for my taste, but the film does boast some interesting twists on this otherwise dubious theme.
For the first of its two hours, The Pledge treads along some pretty familiar ground.  Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a veteran Nevada police detective who, on the very day of his retirement party, ends up at the scene of the brutal slaying of a 7-year old girl.  Jerry finds himself pledging to her distraught mother that he will leave no stone unturned in bringing her childs killer to justice.  Almost immediately, a suspect is arrested and forced to confess, but he kills himself while being taken to his cell, thus closing the case for all concerned  except, of course, Jerry who, for reasons unfathomable to him or us  other than that this is the way these plots always turn out  feels that something is not quite kosher with the outcome.  Thus, throughout the first half, the film goes through the motions common to this narrative setup: over-the-hill veteran follows a hunch that all the less seasoned pros dismiss as the rantings of a guy unable to give up the glory of the chase and settle into the quiet life of leisurely retirement.  Jerry is, thus, on his own to prove them wrong and to bring the true culprit to justice.
But just as we are all settled in, ready to follow the movie along its preprogrammed course, damned if director Sean Penn and writer Jerry Kromolowsky don't pull the rug out from under us, sending the film off into new and unconventional territory.  For slowly but surely we begin to see subtle hints that all may not be quite right with Jerrys psyche.  Could it be true  as a number of people along his way suggest  that perhaps he really cant cope with the mundane world of domesticity and that he needs to create a case to make himself feel as if he is still a part of the action?  Or is he, perhaps, so traumatized by the brutality of the crime whose aftermath hes witnessed and so obsessed with fulfilling his pledge to the girls mother that he cant see facts as they really are and feels compelled to devise scenarios that will allow him to play the hero, thereby validating his own relevance?  Or is it possible that he can be both mentally unbalanced and right about his hunches at the same time?  Friedrich Durrenmatts novel provides a solid core upon which the filmmakers can build their case.  Even some of the predictable red herrings achieve more than their usual credibility when filtered through the mind of this potentially disturbed man.  And the downbeat ending demonstrates a bravery rarely seen in Hollywood these days.
Nicholson does a superb job playing out the many aspects of Jerrys mind and personality and Robin Wright Penn provides strong support as the waitress he comes to love through the course of the film.  I wish the filmmakers hadnt felt compelled to enlist an assortment of big name actors to provide cameo appearances throughout the movie.  In this backwater area, it becomes disconcerting to see people like Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shephard, and Harry Dean Stanton pop up for their five-minute appearance, then disappear into the background never to be seen again.  This game of spot-the-stars becomes not only distracting but undercuts the air of authenticity the film is trying so hard to achieve with its location shooting and somber pacing.
As a director, Penn shows definite assurance, allowing the story to unfold at its own deliberate pace, never feeling compelled to interject irrelevant action sequences for their own sweet sake.  He also does a fine job exploiting the small town, rural atmosphere in which the film is set.
The Pledge starts out like a conventional thriller, but it ends up, much to the satisfaction of its audience, as something strangely unique and compelling.",1011657600,2,4008,4.7936046511627906
1283808,2,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge (Sean Penn, 2000)

Watching this movie after reading the book upon which it is based has the distinct feeling one gets while watching a brand new  Ferrari speeding towards a brick wall at a hundred twenty miles per hour. You know from the moent it comes into your view that something is terribly wrong, and you know what the outcome will be, yet  you continue to watch in hopes that the driver will turn the wheel at the last minute and survive the spectacle. Unfortunately, The Pledge is like the Spyder that Elias Koteas used for the James Dean  recreation in the film Crash-- you know that the guy behind the wheel here not only wanted the crash to occur, but that the crash was ultimately the main reason for the existence of the situation. From  there, the best thing you can do is pick it apart and take a twisted fascination in seeing how everything went so horribly wrong.

In this case, you can sum up what went wrong in one easy sentence: the screenwriters who adapted the book had their priorities  really, really screwed up. Instead of focusing on the main character's downfall and making the film into the same brilliant character study the book is, the film focuses on the subplot that is simply the  catalyst for the main characters downfall. As a result, many of the scenes in the first half of the book upon which the narrative turns are gutted or altogether excised. The end result is that the main  character, Black (Jack Nicholson), ends up looking like a levelheaded cop who's going about his business investigating a crime, even past his retirement, who eventually suffers a meteoric descent into  madness for no discernible reason. (This isn't a spoiler: the opening scene of the movie is Nicholson standing, staring into the sun, muttering to himself and drinking.) This isn't Lovecraft; people don't go  mad overnight in Durrenmatt's work. What makes his novels and plays so downright delicious is the descent itself, watching the main character(s) go mad just because they can't handle the world the way it  is. It's not the one big event, it's the multitude of small events. That is absent from the screenplay, and the movie suffers greatly for it.

Looked at as its own piece, the movie becomes a bit more bearable. Black is a cop who catches a child murder case with six hours to  go on the last day before he retires. He promises the child's mother that he will catch the murderer. The next day, the police have a suspect in custody, thanks to a witness who can place him at  the scene. Everyone's convinced the suspect is the murderer except Black, who keeps digging into the case in order to find the real killer. It's a tried and true mystery formula, and it could  have been made to work here. But, to turn my earlier argument on its head, once you get past the point where the scriptwriters gutted Durrenmatt's novel, they then decided to keep as much of what happens  AFTER this as possible (changing enough to make a 1957 novel look contemporary and setting it in America, both of which are cosmetic changes). This is where the movie fully derails, as the lack  of setup in the beginning makes everything that happens in the second half of the film look coincidental at best. It just doesn't work...",1011571200,7,3247,4.627177700348432

I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen and I wished I had gotten my money back at the theater.  Well, I have had the chance to watch it again, this time on DVD, and it seems like I made a pretty big mistake.  This isn't the worst movie after all.  I actually enjoyed it much more the second time around.
First, it wasn't all my fault.  The movie was advertised completely wrong.  You are sold on the idea that ""The Pledge"" is going to be a non-stop thrill ride like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""The Bone Collector.""  This movie is somewhat of a thriller, but it is more of a film noir.  That was another problem; I didn't know what a ""film noir"" was until I took a film class in college last semester.  Now that I know what a film noir consists of, I was able to appreciate this movie for what it was.  This movie relies more on story and character development than anything else.  We slowly get to see Jack Nicholson becoming more obsessive over his desire to find ""The Wizard""; a child killer who just might strike again.
Don't get me wrong, in no way is this film flawless.  It still has some problems.  Some scenes drag out a little longer than they should, and we should've seen Nicholson starting to become wrapped up more and more into his dark little world of promises and desire in a way that would better set the stage up for the conclusion, which some people may find unsatisfying.  Now knowing what I was going to see, I can appreciate how it ends more.  You may need to see it more than once to realize if you like it or not.
Sean Penn did a great job of making this film.  You can easily tell that he wasn't in it for the money; otherwise he would've made it more gory, more action-packed, and so on.  He wanted to make a film that he could be proud of, and one with great artistic value.
Again, I apologize for my first review, although it was a pretty funny one.  The advertising of the film was the main problem.  This is more of a watch-it-at-home type rather than a one to see in theaters.  RENT this one first before buying it; it's a unique one that only a certain number of people are bound to like.  Sorry, no eye-popping DVD special features, so don't have your heart set on that aspect of the DVD.

Wright thinks there may be a future between her and Jack, while Jack doesn't seem too interested, maybe because he smells a problem involving Wright's daughter being watched by a strange man.

1283814,4,B00003CXSH,"The Pledge is a clever and disturbing pyschological thriller which sticks with you long after the final ending.

In a nutshell, its the story of a retired cop(Nicholson) who cannot let go of his final case--the brutal murder of a young girl.  Convinced the wrong man was convicted of the crime, Nicholson spends his retirement trying to keep the pledge he made to the girl's mother by finding the killer.

This is not a film for everyone.  Instead of a conventional whodunnitthat is concerned with solving the mystery, its a character study interested in examining the impact of the hunt on Nicholson's character.  As such, it tends to move slowly, at least in comparison to your typical major studio fare.

For the thinking viewer, this is a small price to pay.  The film slowly builds to a climax that , at first left me disappointed,as I was hoping for a different resolution.  After time, I realized that was the point as it is not the crime, but its effect on Nicholson that is really important.  Its one of those cases where I thought I was watching one movie until the credits hit and then I realized I was watching something else altogether, something that ultimately was operating on a much deeper level.

 Without saying too much, the film ends on a perplexing note, one that I'm certain would not play well with test audiences or focus groups. However, as I thought about the ending in the minutes and then hours after the film, it kept getting deeper under my skin.  The more questions you ask of the film and the more you deal with the questions it asks of viewers, the creepier it gets.

In that sense, the film plays more as literature.  It would be fascinating to watch and discuss it with a group of people.  As I thought about the film, the closest comparison I could make is to being in a high school lit class and discussing Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, in that much of what is happening is open to multiple layers of interpretation and there are no easy resolutions.  Although this causes some frustration, it also adds to the disturbing nature of the film.  Both Nicholson and director Sean Penn take us to very uncomfortable places in the human psyche, places most films lack the ambition and courage to go.  Frankly, I didn't sleep well after watching this one.

For a guy who's known as one of the best actors in the business, most of Jack Nicholson's roles in the last 10 years or so have consisted of Jack doing his impersonation of somebody else's Jack Nicholson impression.  Not so here.  Nicholson digs deep into his role as the retired police officer, constructing his character so subtly that when the payoff comes in the movie's climactic scene you never see it coming.  This is also a credit to director Sean Penn who has created a really affecting film, even if its not one for everybody.",1008806400,3,2830,4.584493041749503

I haven't seen Nicholson ever since ""As Good As It Gets"" and really, I just have to say, ""Why, Jack?!"" I've seen better Jack Nicholson movies than this, such as ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Batman"", ""Wolf"", and ""The Crossing Guard"". But ""The Pledge"" has to be among the worst ones. And I really don't know what to say about Sean Penn's directing in this film right now. In conclusion, this movie may be great for renting, but it is not great to own, whether it's on video or DVD!

Don't get me wrong, it's well acted. The fact that the ending was disappointing isn't all that bad either. It's more the fact that you get slowly dragged along, waiting for the interesting/exciting part. Afterwards you're left to think about the film and reflect on what little went on. Some people turn that into ""boy this movie is great because it's different from other movies."" Originality doesn't mean entertainment though.

1283938,5,B00003CXSH,"Those poor souls who think a movie is ""for entertainment purposes only"" can only handle one narrow form of entertainment -- will the good guys win?  This film not only answers this question -- the bad guy loses, but the good guys don't ""win"" -- it also takes in the world outside your movie theater (or home) as part of engaging you.  Why did Penn linger so long on things unrelated to the mystery or chase?  The answer is in the ""long"" -- he lets the settings and music lull you into wishing the whole crime could be forgotten, the hero could enjoy his retirement.  We see the life any non-cop might enjoy.  But since he's a cop, the world is still not ""right"" to him until he resolves this crime; then, perhaps, he may enjoy the beauty of the place he's chosen.  At the same time, we understand how this beauty is threatened by crime; his choice may be inevitable.  He does everything he knows is right, yet the world has its own way of resolving the problem without regard to his needs.  The prologue doesn't ""telegraph"" or give away anything.  It tells us not to expect the wrong resolution, and expect slick-suspense-movie action.  Nicholson is obviously tormenting himself over something that went wrong, so that we can then watch for what he did to make it go wrong.  That's the REAL mystery.  He has a beautiful retired life, and a chance to use his skills to heal both a shattered family and his own misgivings at turning his job over to lesser men.  Being a cop, he may not see it, but these hopes are in tension; whether or not he does anything about it.  Being a cop, he sets himself up to pay a worse personal price than any of us might.  He had thought of everything, planned masterfully; ... what WAS the problem?  The pledge itself; not just the one over this crime, but the one he implicitly made when he first took the job.  He cannot perfectly honor it.  See how YOU would test yourself against it!  The universe is harder than we are, but also more forgiving, a very hard lesson for the ultimate system of rational hopes: criminal justice.  THAT'S why Penn takes his time: to let what's at stake sink in, and THAT'S what the film is about.  And all this came to me solely through feeling it, as I watched.  Penn's intuition is dead-on accurate.",1005177600,,2264,4.417874396135265
1283939,1,B00003CXSH,"Penn uses a bunch of stale directorial cliches, including the opening shots of Nicholson. Anyone who has ever seen a movie knew that this was foreshadowing of the ending of this picture. As a result, I spent the entire movie trying to figure out how (and when) Jack would end up in that scene. I say ""when"" because this is a long drawn out affair.
I generally like dark,intelligent films, but this movie tries too hard to fit that through cinematography and character study. As a result, the actual storytelling suffers and is weak. There are significant holes in the storyline and ridiculous scenes to fill other holes in the storyline. A lot of good books fail to make the cross-over to film, especially those movies that are deep, third person character studies. I have not read the book but imagine that it is far better that the movie.
I respectfully disagree with other reviewers who imply that people who do not like this movie ""just don't get it"". This is simply not a good movie in my opinion.",1003708800,2,1002,4.603351955307263

No, this is not your normal police-procedural movie.  The plot is a clothesline for one character's descent into alcoholism and, more or less, insanity.  I think the key is ironically what a lot of people complain about: the ending.  Without giving anything away, when it comes down to it, Nicholson's detective was right all along.  He played everything perfectly, but for a simple twist of fate, he ends up being the bad guy.  Hey, that would probably drive me to the bottel too.  Not perfect, but vastly underrated.

1283941,2,B00003CXSH,"Whenever a film-maker adapts a book, especially one by a major writer, he has many different layers or angles to choose from.  In Friedrich Durrenmatt's rich and suggestive novel 'the Pledge', Sean Penn could have chosen from:  a tense detective story about a child-killer; a deconstruction of detective stories (and narrative itself), its assumptions, methods and iconography; a study of mental breakdown, the limits of reason in a rational society, and of a man who has lived a long professional life and begins to wonder what it all meant; a portrait of a rural community and its relationship to a bureaucratic, indifferent urban centre; the terrible fears, in a regimented, air-brushed, famously peaceful and neutral country, of madness, criminality and violence; the obstacles of Absurdity and Chance scuppering all man's progress.
By virtue of filming the novel, Penn touches on most of these subjects, but doesn't really seem interested in any of them.  It's not that he needs to be rigorously faithful to the book - indeed, the more faithful a literary adaptation, the duller it usually is.  Durrenmatt's novel itself was a reworking of a much more conventional screenplay he wrote for a Swiss film, so he knew what was or wasn't possible in the cinema.  But this 'Pledge' lacks focus.  If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have been able to follow the film half the time.
Penn isn't remotely interested in the crime genre - not only does this give the film a sluggish pace, but the whole idea of a detective losing the one thing that defines his status and power (his mind) lacks the emotional resonance you get in, say, 'Touch of Evil' or 'Vertigo'.  Penn, casting Sam Shepherd and Harry Dean Stanton is clearly trying to create a kind of mythic American epic like 'Paris Texas' (whose narrative he bleakly reverses), but what's he saying?  what are we supposed to feel or recognise?  There are occasionally interesting sequences (such as the interrogation of the Indian like the sexual abuse he's been accused of).  The symbolism is heavy-handed, and the performances from an amazing cast are uniformly atrocious, with the exceptions of Aaron Eckhart and Stanton.  And Jack, the one reason 'Pledge' remains at all watchable, keeping all the mysteries of motivation and feeling to himself, and all the more intriguing for that.",1003190400,2,2338,4.984575835475578
1283942,3,B00003CXSH,"'The Pledge' is not a typical murder mystery or a typical Jack Nicholson movie.  Nicholson plays a Reno, Nevada cop named Black who decides to get involved in one last case literally during the middle of his retirement party.  Making a promise to find a little girl's murderer, Black begins a journey that leads him down a dark road of desperation and obsession.
I can't remember seeing Nicholson play a character that was this uncertain since 'The King of Marvin Gardens.'  The only thing about Black that is certain is his obsession to find the ""giant"" who is killing little girls.  Nicholson's carefully controlled performance is, as usual, first-rate.  The inner conflict between seeking justice and placing a family at risk is played very well by Nicholson and director Penn.  The supporting cast is generally good, but too much talent is wasted.  Vanessa Redgrave appears in only one brief scene...Harry Dean Stanton does nothing beyond selling his gas station...Benicio Del Toro is gripping while on-screen, but he's not on for long.  Yet, the short screen-time by the supporting cast is probably not what bothers most viewers...it's the conclusion.
Without giving away the ending, I can say two things:
1 - It works, in its own way
2 - It didn't leave me satisfied
I understand the ending, and I can see how the events of the film progress to it, but I was disappointed.  Penn sets up the film well, but everything leading up to the ending leads the audience to believe that their expectations are going to be met.  They aren't, or at least they weren't for me.  Again, I understand and appreciate the ending, it just wasn't what Penn prepared us for.  In the film's favor, I was glad that this was not a strict formula picture.  There's a lot to consider when the film is playing and there's a lot to think about after it's over.  For that aspect alone, 'The Pledge' is worth viewing.",1002499200,10,1893,4.7317073170731705

There were just too many such ""Oliver Stone Moments"", which gave me the impression that the main focus of the directing was on gimmickry--rather than on story-telling.
Speaking of the story, that was a bit weak, too.  Why did the film end the way it did?  I could see no logic or cause/effect relationship between the events in the final scenes.

One of the big problems the film had, I guess, is that it was marketed as a thriller. It is nothing of the sort. There's no action chases, no gunfights, and no simple resolution. Instead it's about the protagonist's slow slip into obsession, to the point where he commits a moral crime himself in his monomaniac crusade.

1284083,1,B00003CXSH,"Mediocre minds can become famous and powerful: this film attests to this fact.  Sean Penn is good actor, but a poor director, and a poor judge of a screenplay.  Yet obviously he has clout and credibility as an actor, so when he calls his actor buddies, out they come...Boy, oh boy, Sean, I'm impressed!  You know Sam Shepherd!  And Vanessa Redgrave!  You even defrosted Harry Dean Stanton, but you could have thawed him out for longer than two minutes - I suppose fair's fair 'though: that's about all anybody gets.  Penn thinks that if a subject is 'serious' or 'disturbing', then it justifies a long movie - the Hollywood Academy agrees with him (if you want to win the award for best picture, better make your movie over two hours).  This is a very tedious story, with very few surprises, and almost no character development.  Jerry Black, Jack Nicholson's character, gets obsessed, goes a bit loopy and...well, that's about it really.  Why?  Who cares...well, Sean doesn't in any case.  To stretch out the thin material out and to hammer it into the audience that they are watching 'disturbing' and 'important' subject matter, Penn resorts to ponderous long takes - often with the opposite of the intended effect: in Benicio's interrogation scene he mumbles and shakes for so long that the cinema audience started laughing.  We also get close ups of coffee pots, of bottles of whiskey; we have blurred shots, lots of camera panning, repetitive shots of Jack driving his truck on scenic roads - it looks like Sean has watched a few European films, thought some of the techniques looked good, so (why not?) bung 'em into his film, even if they are utterly pointless here.  Oh, and since we're being 'cutting edge', how about some really grim crime-scene shots - yeah, let's push that envelope, baby.  Clearly, as a director, Penn is a second-rate intelligence.  Insulting the audience further, he thinks that a 'sad' ending, means a 'deep' film: is that really all it takes Sean?  Gee, it's that easy, huh?  This is boring rubbish.  Jack Nicholson is a shadow of his former rudely endearing self.  Robin Wright Penn does not become a better actress by having a fake broken tooth.  If you want to see a slow-paced film with great moral weight and complexity, try 'Ordet' by Carl Dreyer, or 'Andrei Rublev' by Andrei Tarkovsky; or if you want an engrossing crime movie, why not 'L.A.Confidential' or 'The Untouchables'; and if you want to see the beautiful scenery in Nevada, go to Nevada.",999907200,6,2489,4.7981220657277

1284190,5,B00003CXSH,"""The Pledge"" starts with the retirement of Detective Jerry Black(Nicholson). Unfortunately, a mere 6 hours before Black's retirment, a little girl is raped and murdered. Black makes a pledge to the grieving mother that he will find her daughter's killer. Immediately an Indian named Toby(del Toro)is arrested for the murder, with a long criminal history Toby is a logical choice. The detectives even get a confession out of Toby, however seconds later Toby committs suicide. So the case if officially closed. However, Black isn't satisfied. He becomes obsessed when he finds out that 8 years ago another little girl was raped and murdered and another girl is still missing. They all match the same description and age range. Black goes so far as to buy a general store and start a relationship with a single mother(who has a little girl). He uses them as bait in trying to get the killer he is convinced is still out there. ""The Pledge"" is NOT a mindless action-packed Hollywood movie with a typical happy ending. It is an exercise in great acting and psychology. Jerry Black is chasing a killer but he is also trying to turn back time. There are some incredible scenes in the beginning of the movie where Black looks at pictures of himself when he was young, he also catches a glimpse of an elderly man using a walker to get around outside his window. This is what awaits Black, unless he can prove that he is still useful. Black is chasing a killer but he's also chasing his youth and usefulness. ""The Pledge"" is an intelligent work of art with an incredible performance from Nicholson.

1284193,3,B00003CXSH,"""The Pledge"" flew under most everyone's radar when it was released theatrically earlier this year.  I was somewhat surprised at the time, given the success of dark films like ""Seven"" and the pedigree of Nicholson and Sean Penn, but it makes sense in retrospect.  Today's multiplex is not friendly to movies like this. ""The Pledge"" is a flawed study of obsession that isn't for everyone.  You may turn it off halfway through, bored with director Penn's deliberate style.  Or, like me, you may be compelled to see it again and again.
Not many actors have the presence to pull a role like Jerry Black off, and Nicholson does it with skill to burn. However, while the script turns on some nagging questions, one of them  undermines much of the film: we don't understand Jerry well enough to know what fuels his obsession.  Was it some previous case that went bad?  ""The Pledge"" doesn't want to give you all the answers, and leaves several things deliberately cryptic, but everything hinges on Jerry's motivation.  How did Mrs. Larsen (Patricia Clarkson) coax such a life-or-death pledge out of Jerry?  And if he agrees merely to tell a grieving mother what she wants to hear, why does he feel so bound by the pledge, and why does he follow through to such a degree? Another major flaw is the stunted romance between Jerry and Robin Wright Penn's character--it feels obligatory, as if the screenwriters were just using a tried and true playbook, but it's somewhat implausible, doesn't serve the plot, and should've been scrapped.
But with Nicholson, the consummate pro, and some good use of the Nevada setting's stark beauty (the night- and snow-bound murder scene is as good as movies get), ""The Pledge"" overcomes some script weaknesses and pacing problems to deliver a flawed but compelling portrait of human obsession.  A warning: if you like every answer wrapped up in a neat little package at the end, this is NOT the movie for you. ""The Pledge"" is challenging and flawed, but I'll take a movie like this over any number of ""Pearl Harbors"" that you want to throw my way.",997142400,9,2070,4.773109243697479
1284194,3,B00003CXSH,"This movie definitely will polarize viewers.  People that like happy endings where all the plots are easily sewn up will detest 'The Pledge'.  Those who are more comfortable with a 'real-life' ending will acknowledge that Nicholson plays this character flawlessly.  Nicholson portrays a retired cop who becomes so blinded by obsession in finding this serial killer and keeping his commitment to one of the victim's families, he doesn't comprehend that putting someone else's child in harm's way in hopes of catching this fiend is just as bad as not doing anything and just retiring.
Also, I think I'm in the minority here but this is one of Benicio Del Toro's weaker acting performances.  He just doesn't convince me that he's a Native American.  On a side note - I'm a huge Del Toro fan so it hurts me to write this.  In fact my wife felt just the opposite on his performance so judge for yourself on how well he plays this role.
Yes, Sean Penn makes depressing stuff, but does that surprise anyone now?  Judge the director on how the story comes out, regardless of how uncomfortable it might make one feel.  This movie, while not a classic, doesn't deserve the trashing it has recieved.",997056000,2,1188,4.733009708737864

1284198,4,B00003CXSH,"Sean Penn's third directorial project portends a promising future behind the camera.  Despite having to overcome a somewhat flawed screenplay, Penn shows talent at creating a textured character study with some wonderful photography thrown in.  While the film drew criticism for its deliberate pace, every scene adds another brushstroke to the human canvas and develops the characters richly.  This film is not an action adventure thriller, and it was never intended to be.  The only criticism I have of Penn's direction is his failure to rectify a number of plot flaws (such as the gas station transaction which was ridiculously unbelievable).
The story follows Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), who on the day of his retirement from the police force is called in to help solve one more case involving the murder of a little girl.  When the case is closed after a confession is coerced out of a simpleton, Jerry is not convinced.  He made a pledge to the victim's mother to find the killer and he doesn't feel that he is being true to that pledge.  So, he buys a gas station in the area he suspects that the killer resides and does a little investigating from within the community.
Penn keeps the film intriguing, giving us subtle clues that cast suspicion on numerous characters as possible murder suspects.  At one point I even thought the murderer might have been Jerry.  Ultimately the murderer is revealed, but the ending is unsatisfying, leaving the viewer without the vindication of seeing him properly brought to justice.
Nicholson is at his moody and sardonic best in this film.  He has an innate ability to play the complex and offbeat character to perfection, always believable despite being on the fringe of mental instability.  Robin Wright Penn takes an unglamorous role portraying a hard working lower class mother and gives a tremendous performance.  Aaron Eckhart is obnoxious and unbelievable as detective Stan Krolak, but Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as the simple minded Toby, who gets pinned with the murder because he was seen in the area.
This is a good film with a mediocre story and a promising outing for Penn.  I rated it a 7/10.  Action junkies will be bored but for those who enjoy a good character study it is worth a look.",996796800,,2262,4.872062663185378

I knew nothing about The Pledge before I saw it, the best way to see a movie. It grabbed me from the beginning.  Sean Penn deserves cudos for taking on this existential story, and develop it into a visually beautiful, totally believable film.  Nicholson's portrayal of this sympathetic character, going deeper and deeper into his quest of honoring a promise kept the film going.  And the sprinkling of jewel-like cameo performances seemed like Penn's gifts to the viewer, which also kept the film going...giving us just enough of  Benicio Del Toro, Vanessa Redgrave,  Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton, etc. I am still thinking about The Pledge.  It was as if Fate was a main character.  I think it's the puzzling endings that keep you thinking.  And I think many of life's experiences have the same unresolved endings.

He keeps (or at least tries to) his promise and even though he was now retired, he still continued to search for the person that killed the little girl...paranoid and all. Not worth my time.

Granted, I like fishing just as much as the next person, but my god!  There's only so much a guy can take!!
  Anyway, the rest of the film was adorned with an empty plot and ludicrous details which the director (Sean Penn-who should stick to acting) believed were legitimate ""twists.""  I'm not sure what Mr. Penn was trying to achieve with this film.  And if he accomplished his goal, well, congratulations to him.  I hope he enjoys his success while those of us who witnessed his badly composed opus are left retching in our popcorn.
My advice to the movie-going public would be to stay away from this movie.  It feels longer than ""Titanic,"" (if THAT's possible)and is more pointless than every Paulie Shore film ever made.

1284449,1,B00003CXSH,"This movie is a great idea for a story, but so poorly executed that I ended up turning it off to watch an old Marty Feldman flick because I just couldn't take it any more.  The whole movie can be summarized by this:  there are a lot of scenes which appear to be artistic but convey no point, and have no meaning.  The plot is simple and leads up to a classic confrontation ... which never happens because the main nemesis in the movie gets killed in a random car crash before the confrontation.  Throw in a lot of gratuitous product placement (Mepps comes to mind), poorly written dialogue, cheesy emotional music reminiscent of Titanic, irrational and flat characters (lots of them), and extremely long, boring chunks of film where NOTHING happens, and then add in a bunch of half-baked ""background"" scenes, and you have a high-budget movie which Hollywood can make a buck off of.  That's it.  I'm sure the actors in the movie have some talent.  The Del Toro performance (which is so short as to give us, the viewers, no real indication as to what motivations or feelings might have dwelt in the character) was perhaps the only thing worth watching in the movie, and it lasted maybe two paltry minutes.  If we were really meant to suspend our disbelief and think that maybe he was the culprit, it would be a good thing to spend more than five minutes total on developing the character before having him conveniently kill himself.  The alternating close-up shots of the main character's eyes, the clock, and random objects in the character's field of view make me think ... hmmm, this seems to be a film that somebody is trying to get artistic with.  Too bad the artistic scenes really had nothing to do with the movie, and were really just annoying interruptions.  The behavior of the cops in the movie was atrocious - sadly this may be fairly true-to-life, but in the movie it just comes across as another poorly constructed reason for the main character to honor his ""Pledge.""  Mr. Nicholson should have turned down this role, he's done good work in the past but this was [terrible].  Del Toro did some good work, but was given absolutely NOTHING to work with.  Everybody did their job well, but the whole thing was brought together very poorly.  Think to yourself:  ""how would Alfred Hitchcick have done this?""  and I think you'll be on the right track; the movie could very well have been done by him, in which case it might have been a blockbuster that people would be talking about for ages.

In other words what it comes down to is a movie that is so different that depending on what you are expecting, it may or may not please you.
Before I go into my personal feelings of the movie, I will have to agree that Nicholson's performance of the retiring police officer was good.  Many people wonder if the man can continue to do a stellar performance and it's evident that no matter how old Nicholson is, he will always be a talented actor.  What I disagree with is this film being one of his prized performances and movies.
Second, I agree that Sean Penn did very well as a director in this movie, the cinematography was indeed beautiful but unfortunately a stellar performance, good directing, good music and good cinematography cannot make a great movie with a storyline that leaves you feeling empty and making you say ""Is that it?""
This movie will go in my list of reviews of movies with strong potential but with a purpose to be different that will attract some moviegoers but more than likely will alienate people.  In this list are movies such as ""Arlington Road"" and ""Juliet in Love"".
As with my review of ""Arlington Road"", I give the the movie credit for being different and for having an ending so unlike what many people would expect but does being different mean good?  Perhaps to some people.  Some people found ""Arlington Road"" brilliant.  Some people found ""The Pledge"" brilliant because both movies are different.  Not me.
As for the DVD, video and audio is good.  The music sounds good but this is more of a dialogue film, so it's not one of those that you will expect to be testing out your receiver.  As for special features, this movie only features a trailer and cast info (not for the whole cast...was this DVD rushed?).
So, if you are in the mood for something different and have a craving for a really good recent performance of Nicholson, check this DVD out.",994118400,,2063,4.578804347826087
1284454,4,B00003CXSH,"I like movies that don't follow the formula. I like movies that take risks. I like movies that remain with you a couple of days after you watch them. In that regard, The Pledge is right on target. Sean Penn (director), Jack Nicholson (lead), and the rest of the cast did a fabulous job in this film. Twice, I thought I had the killer all figured out; and I'm glad I was wrong. This film takes viewers down several paths for us only to find ourselves facing a dead end.
My only gripes about this movie are a)the love interest between Nicholson's and Wright-Penn's characters, and b) the ending. I will never understand why every movie must be burdened with a love interest element, even when it's obvious that it's not necessary. So we end up with totally unsavory (read, older man--younger woman, it's been done already!) pairings. But to Penn's credit, the relationship between Nicholson's and Wright-Penn's characters was more tastefully done than I've seen in other movies. Though if Nicholson had been more of a father/grandfather to Wright-Penn and the girl, it would have been just as believable.
Okay, now to the ending. Many have argued for and against the ending. Though I appreciate Penn's attempt to not tie up all the loose ends and hand us the ending all tied up in a bow, the ending was still very unsatisfying. As I stated earlier, I like movies that are different; and I understand that as a viewer I must suspend belief for awhile. But it didn't seem so much like real life (as in, not all real life issues are tied up neatly) as it smacked of someone saying, ""Na, na, na, na, na. This ending is silly, but it's edgier because it's 180 degrees away from plausible."" Please! I think a more creative ending could have been wrought from such a marvelous build-up.
Disturbing most of all were the last frames. I still think the movie could have ended up there without the pathetic ending. But that's just my opinion. But this was still a good movie that shouldn't be missed.",994118400,,1987,4.6

1284557,5,B00003CXSH,"This time out as a director Sean Penn did not also do the writing.  He used a first rate novel, written by the late  Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt, and adapted by first rate screenwriters Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski. It shows.  The writing is complex and finely nuanced, taking no predictible Hollywood plot or character turns. The film is also highly artistic. Actors must love to work for Penn because he obtained the very best for even single scene roles.

As retiring police detective Jerry Black, Nicholson is pulled into one last case and pledges to a grieving mother that he will find her daughter's killer.  This sets him off on a long, obsessive course of action to trap this killer.  He has an incredible amount of patience in setting his lure, much like his favorite avocation, fishing, requires of its followers.  This also sets in motion his using and manipulating other people, particularly a single mother and her daughter, which heightens the tension considerably.  Robin Wright Penn does her usual first class acting job as that single mother.

Perhaps the most startling performance in the whole film is Benicio del Toro as a mentally handicapped Indian the police believe is the killer.  Del Toro may have quite an acting future ahead if this performance is any indication of the range of his ability.  He even outdoes his ""Traffic"" performance.  I read that this film was a sensation when it screened at the Cannes Film Festival and I can certainly see why that experienced audience was so impressed.  Nicholson's closing moments of acting in the film are amongst the finest in his long acting career.

  I had a real problem with the ending too. I think it was a mistake and made the whole exercise really pointless. Not to give anything away but to me, it would make more sense if Nicholson's character had to really deal with consequences of his actions with his newly found family.

I would have to disagree .. the ending is exactly what lifts this movie out of the *merely good* bracket, right into the *damn powerful* category.
I was expecting the formulaic denouement .. and half-resigned, I was waiting for the the usual Hollywood ending I could see approach a mile away already .. and then I was taken by surprise as the narrative made a really unexpected curve.
So I say hooray! for movies and story-telling that doesn't resort to formula, and that can still grip us right to the end  and linger afterwards in our mind.",993772800,,761,4.984251968503937
1284560,4,B00003CXSH,"Once again Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson team up to stuff their finger firmly into the eye of Hollywood, and with tremendous results.  In ""The Pledge"" Nicholson plays a detective on the eve of retirement who makes a promise to catch the killer of a brutally murdered young girl.  His subseqent investigation yields a string of similar murders, convincing Nicholson that he is dealing with a serial killer that has gone undetected until now.  However, Nicholson's belief is based more on gut feeling than on hard-core proof, and his colleagues at the police station he used to work at comment to each other sadly that he is losing his mind. Nicholson's faith in the much younger Penn's direction is remarkable to behold.  One would assume that Nicholson would be wary of putting so much of his reputation into Penn's young, and relatively new to directing, hands.  But Penn does a marvelous job and constructs a wonderfully developed film that utilizes Nicholson's patented sneers and onscreen orneryness to perfection. This movie's greatest attribute is that it keeps you guessing.  There are many false paths thrown in just in anticipation of clever audience members who have seen this type of drama many times before.  With such a well-worked storyline, it would be easy for ""The Pledge"" to fall into cliche', but instead, it uses the cliches to lure you into a false sense of security before pulling the rug out from under your feet. This is a movie that is definatly worth a look, mainly for Nicholson's performance and Penn's direction, but also for small parts by Robin Wright Penn (looking as unglamourous as possible) and Mickey Rourke (who steals the show in about a two minute monologue).  If you're looking for a quality piece of filmaking that is aware of convention and twists it wildly, this is the film for you.",993686400,2,1825,4.864516129032258
1284561,4,B00003CXSH,"There is much to recommend in this complex and deeply layered psychological thriller featuring Jack Nicholson in what seems to have evolved into a continuing exploration into the dark side of human nature in his roles over the last decade. This is a gorgeously photographed and quite penetrating drama which on one level involves Nicholson as a dogged, troubled, and obsessed retired detective convinced the actual killer of his last gruesome juvenile homocide case is still at large, while on another level it is a stunning and all-too graphic portrait of what such single-minded concentration can do to a fragile and vulnerable personality. While it is not a movie I would recommend to the faint of heart, it is an absorbing exploration into this character's heart of darkness and the perils associated with such risky adventures.
The movie is set supposedly in Reno and the surrounding Sierras, and the natural scenery that provides the stage for this drama is simply breath taking, and is worth the viewing experience for this experience alone. I was, however, disappointed to discover by viewing the end credits that the movie was largely shot in western Canada. Wherever it was filmed, the scenery provides a curious backdrop to the ugliness and sordidness of human beings, and how their own experiences and personalities blind them to the beauty in others around them. Each has been branded by the character and limitations of his or her own reservoir of emotional experiences, and each is consequently sent spinning toward a seemingly irrevocable tendency to make snap conclusions about complex realities as a result.
Thus Nicholson is caught in the dilemma of not only his own troubles, but in the easy answers others have in attributin ghis actions and behavior to other motives and problems. Thus Robin Wright Penn, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shepard, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and a number of notable others blithely (and sometimes painfully) slip past the rather remarkable qualities in Nicholson's character as well as in Wright Penn's memorable turn as a woman with battered background and a beautiful little girl who lights up the screen and who also just happens to exactly fit Nicholson's bogeyman serial killer's profile.
Thus, his motives for the subsequent involvement are confused at best, yet he seems to genuinely care for the new family he adopts along the way. With this, the stage is set for potential tragedy, and while I found the conclusion emotionally and dramatically unpleasing, it was admittedly indeed in the scope of the characters and circumstance to have it so ended. I recommend this, but also caution against letting one's impressionable children watch this. Like ""Silence Of The Lambs"" or ""Seven"", this is hardly juvenile entertainment.  Enjoy!",993686400,30,2788,5.154525386313466
1284562,1,B00003CXSH,"I don't even know where to begin here. I will start off by asking ""WHY are there so many GOOD reviews for this movie?!"" Was anybody paying attention to this thing?  It was bad. I mean really bad. This is the 2nd move to ever really anger me. The first being ""Dude, Where's My Car?""
When I saw the trailer for this movie I was excited, although I didn't get around to seeing it in the theater.  So when a couple friends had said they rented it and were going to watch it, I was all for it.
We put in the DVD and away we went.  Hours later, we were cursing the movie, Sean Penn, and how it was nothing but a big waste of time. Not only was the story and content of the movie pointless, but technically it was very bad.  It consisted of horrible editing and pointless shots. At one point there is a slow zoom in on this camera in the interrogation room as if to say ""HEY! LOOK!!! There's this other camera still here... see it... you see it?... you still see it?"" They try and point out things that anyone over the age of 5 would already notice. There were also pointless ""creative"" type direction trying to be pulled out of this movie which just ended up being crap. If you want to watch a truely great director, watch Sam Raimi flicks.  That is real style, of which Sean Penn lacks. He should stick to acting.
So after the movie we end up checking out the movie trailer for the film to see what on Earth possessed us to want to watch such a BAD movie. The trailer misleads the viewer in a major way. So much so, that I bet someone could sue, which is what's happening as of this writing with ""The Animal"".
I curse  Sean Penn and everyone else associated with this movie. If horrible movies like this can be made then I think I've just about had it with movies in general.",993600000,6,1770,4.145772594752186
1284563,5,B00003CXSH,"In January, 2001, some had grown tired of the pitiful attempts at cinematics which had found itself present in the vast majority of films released in the final quarter of 2000. And then ""The Pledge,"" came along. The movie, which stars Jack Nicholson (and features appearences by Benicio del Toro and Robin Wright Penn), is, quite simply, the most amazing work of genius I've ever seen. Its avant-garde shades of depression and a growing insanity hold the viewer tight for the entire film. Sean Penn (as director), bravely paints his picture using the most glowing and irredescent shades of emotion that have ever been put on film. Several parts in the film (including the aptly titled ""Gone Fishin'"" scene) have imagery that is so beatiful and free it brings a tear to one's eye. To go along with this amazing work of art comes another: the sountrack. It is graced with the hands of Wazimbo, an African trance-music god (composing the films greatest song, ""Nwahulwana.) The verdict: Truly the absolute greatest movie ever made by man, showing the contrast of happiness that grows to the insecurities of onesself, dealing with his promise to Mrs. Larsen that he will find her missing daughter.",993340800,,1192,4.905940594059406
1284564,4,B00003CXSH,"I've read numerous reviews on The Pledge. Usually reviews have similar content between each other; this is not the case of The Pledge. I've read reviews that say they love the movie, and others that say that it's boring and maybe too long and many people where unhappy with the end of the movie. But there's something similar I found on every review (with what I agree), Jack Nicholson performance is outstanding. So I decided to watch the movie.
 The Pledge is about a drunk/retired police (played by Jack Nicholson) who makes a promise on finding the murder of a little girl. Even though retired, Jerry Black (the former policeman) continues his search for the murder of this little girl, believing that it is a serial murder.
 After watching the movie I had some things clear. First, Jack Nicholson's performance is really outstanding (but again, that's something Jack has us used to). Also I believe it's a good movie, which maybe won't be so enjoyable for the ones who are waiting for a police/action/drama movie. I believe the Sean Penn (the director) could've give more to the movie, I think that Sean tried it to be more of a suspense movie, but for many this intent of suspense made of the movie a little slow. I recommend this movie for the ones who liked psychological dramas.
 About the ending of the movie. To be honest: yes, it made me unhappy. But I think that's actually the best thing of the movie, because it's something you don't expect and it's new. The keyword is new, with no doubt and unusual ending for an unusual movie. This is good considering that for the last years we've been watching movies that seem more like remakes of old ones. The pledge is a new and unusual movie to watch.",993340800,,1709,4.5967213114754095
1284565,5,B00003CXSH,"As a film lover who has despaired of seeing Jack Nicholson ever giving a fine performance again, I can happily report that his handling of the role of Jerry Black in this film is exceptionally fine.  Not that 'The Pledge' is a star vehicle, despite his name appearing over the title.
The writers and director (Sean Penn) have crafted an excellent film which is part thriller, part psychological drama.  Nevada cop Jerry Black is only hours from retirement when he promises the mother of a murder victim that he will track down her young daughter's killer.  Over the next two hours we travel with him on a journey of uncertainty as he probes deeply into other related murders (despite the case being officially closed), and even in retirement comes uncomfortably close to another potential victim.
The director and writers here wisely avoid two massive cliches that were waiting to happen, namely 'the weary cop striving to crack his last case before retirement', and 'the cop with a hunch failing to convince his sceptical superiors.'  They instead tell a very different story, which far from being depressing, is gripping and keeps the audience guessing until the final scenes.
Sean Penn has done a superb job in involving the audience in this ultimately poignant and tragic film, and has been rewarded with wonderful performances from Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, and several other famous actors in small but critical roles (hardly cameos, as their involvement is crucial to the plot).  These include fine parts for Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave and Harry Dean Stanton, a superb performance from Mickey Rourke, and a bizarre one from Benicio del Toro, who is sadly underused.
The DVD looks superb: a crystal clear and vivid anamorphic 2.35:1 image, which shows off the breathtaking photography of rural Nevada.  Virtually a state-of-the-art transfer, in fact. The use of the camera is very imaginative throughout, and the editing is crisply compelling.
The sound is also excellent.  There are no explosions, car chases or shoot-outs in this film, so the soundtrack merely has to support the excellent dialogue and eclectic music score, and succeeds on every level.  Apart from the trailer and cast profiles there are no extras.
Sean Penn has made an outstanding film, and with so much dross currently being released by Hollywood, I strongly recommend this DVD to all lovers of powerful cinema.",993254400,8,2397,5.065989847715736
1284665,5,B00003CXSH,"An excellent film that looks superb on DVD, I hope that this latest work by Sean Penn gets a wider audience now than it did in its theatrical release. I'm not overly optimistic though; the wonderful performances, with Nicholson outstanding, serve to reinforce the grim subject matter, and lend a reality that many will find too much to bear. I very much enjoyed this film, and recommend it to viewers who appreciate fine acting and storytelling. Just don't expect easy answers and an ending that warms the heart. Sean Penn is one talented dude!",992995200,,544,4.797872340425532
1284666,5,B00003CXSH,"This was the first excellent film of the year for me.  It was a stunning bolt of filmaking from Indian Runner and Crossing Guard director Sean Penn and was acted intensely well by Jack Nicholson.  The effect hasn't changed now that it's on the small screen.
Penn brings a intricate and sprwaling thriller of a story about a retiring detective, played with calm yet fierceness by Nicholson, who makes a promise to the mother of a child who was killed to find the killer.  This leads him into a journey into another woman's life (Wright-Penn) and trying to make sure her daughter doesn't suffer a similar fate.
Penn doesn't pounce on his chances to thrill and ponder like other directors do, but presents them in a way that will well up fright up until the shocking end.  Nicholson is equally exceptional in one of his best recent roles.",992908800,,835,4.621621621621622
1284667,4,B00003CXSH,"First, let me say that I consider Jack Nicholson to be one of most underrated actors of his generation. His performance in ""The Pledge"" is nothing short of remarkable, not so much in the way his speaks the dialogue, but in those moments when he has none, and reveals the mind of a deeply tormented man. Other reviews have discussed the plot, so I'll dispense with that, other than to say that this is a movie about redemption and a lost cause. The pledge referred to in the title is one that Nicholson cannot assuredly keep, and thus forfeits his ""soul's salvation"". The Nicholson character is basically a lonely, desperate man, who hangs his hopes on catching a serial killer, and by a twist of fate, fails in his mission. The supporting cast is excellent, Benecio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn and even Vanessa Redgrave (one of the best performances in the film, although a brief one-scene cameo). Sean Penn's direction is superb, with the intercutting of nature scenes with the main plot (watch for the symbolic flock of birds throughout the film). This is not a film for those who desire neat, tied-up endings but ones which mirror the real and unresolved tragedies of life. Truly a haunting and poignant story, with excellent character studies all around.",992476800,30,1258,4.775229357798165
1284668,5,B00003CXSH,"This by far the best Jack Nicholson movie. It is completley misunderstood. I don't know why people didn't lke it. It sent out a great message. Det. Jerry Black(Nicholson) is going to retire then a case that he couldn't throw away came along. A young girl is kidnapped and murdered. The whole story takes place up in Reno, Nevada. They cought this guy who is menally retarted. He kills himself and then there is nothing else to do. So Jerry goes up into the mountains with a picture that the little girl drew of a giant and a black car tying to find out who it is that did this. After he swore to a victims family that he would find out who it was he cant put it away. He meets this woman who has a little girl and he tells her to stay with him for a while. Sean Penn did an excellent job directing this story. Nicholson has a good respectable character. People should understand the dangers out there and appreciate the importance of this disturbing story. It is a great movie. Nicholson and Sean Penn do another excellent teaming since 1995 The Crossing Guard. It has a terricfic cast to go along with the tale. I really liked this movie a lot and I'm sure you will. I don't know why it didn't do good at the box office. People underestimate sometimes movies like this. It might disturb you but it sends out a great message. Jack Nicholson was perfect for this character. Like I said this is his good hearted performance. It also has a twisted ending. Great cinemetography. Great directing. This movie brings out the best in this cast such as the scene with Nicholson and the prison inmate which is played by Mickey Rourke. Sam Shepard has and ppearance as Nicholsons boss. Check out the book by Freidurik Durrenmont. The reason why it's called the Pledge is because He swore on his soul salvation that he would bring justice and find the man who was responsible for killing her daughter. Once again give the movie a chance it is a great good hearted story. Best Supporting actor of the year Benicio Del Toro under pounds of make up does a superb and scary job as the first killer who is caught. I am so honored to review this movie which is inspiring. I went to see this and knowing theres not a lot of good movies I was very pleased with this one. I loved the brilliant score done by composer Hanz Zimmer who also did Hannibal. Robin Wright is terrific as the woman that stays with Jack Nicholson while he tries to find out who the murderer is. Watch the movie carefully it is twisted. And You'll love this outstanding thriller brilliantly directed by Sean Penn. I haven't done this good of a review since I gave my critique of Schindlers List. It was that good. I can't believe that I'm comparing it to such a brilliant masterpiece. Be safe,hopefully this movie gives you a good moral in it's wonderful style.

1284669,2,B00003CXSH,"When I first saw the previews to this movie I was very excited. I went to see this movie and was very disappointed! Not only do you sit through this movie wondering if there is a serial killer, but you wonder if you care at all. And when you do find out and it brings your interest somewhat back the ending kills it! (Spoiler ahead) I usually like surprise endings, but this surprise was terrible. Why would you throughout the whole movie be waiting for a serial killer and then him not showing up because of a terrible traffic accident. I mean it could happen, but when I go and see a movie about a serial killer you eventually get to the point where you want to see who it is and why? Neither of these questions is answered. Only that Jack Nickelson's character goes nuts, because the serial killer got killed and didn't show up to his ambush. I really thought this was going to be a different movie, in the likes of ""Seven"". It wasn't even close. Also, it could have been at least a half and hour shorter.

1284670,5,B00003CXSH,"Reading the many reviews for this film, I have realized that modern day filmaking has dilluted our minds and left us content with watching boring ""popcorn"" movies such as Armageddon and The Mummy Returns.  Very few movies provoke us the way a film should, as soon as we leave the theater we have totally forgotten what we have just seen.  This is not the case with Sean Penn's latest collaboration with Jack Nicholson (The Crossing Guard).  The Pledge is, as another reviewer stated, ""a breath of fresh air"" in the days that popcorn movies rule the box office.  Sean Penn has chosen to make a film that doesn't follow normal conventions, all the loose ends are not tied up at the end and this is certainly not your normal serial killer movie.  It isn't really even a serial killer movie it all, it is a character study of how far a man will go to keep a pledge to find the killer of a mother's daughter.  Jerry Black's pledge takes him to places he doesn't want to go, and his obsession is seen through Nicholson's emotions and actions.  By the end of the film Jerry Black isn't the same man he was at the beginning.  Those who hated this film were expecting a big, fast, ""chase the killer"" movie, but what we get is one of Nicholson's best performances, and one of the best films of the year!",991353600,19,1293,4.4033613445378155
1284671,5,B00003CXSH,"I gave up reviewing movies on Amazon.com for the most part, but in seeing some of the reviews for ""The Pledge"" I feel compelled to put my two cents in. My opinion may not matter to anyone else but myself, but this movie had me riveted the entire time I watched it with a packed house at a matinee showing. I only mention that because after it was over I was stunned at how many people were walking out of the theater bashing it. I wondered if we were watching the same movie. I think the problem with ""The Pledge"" is that people came for one of two things. 1) A suspensful thriller about a serial killer that would keep them riveted to their seats in the same way ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" did. Or 2) A Jack Nicholson movie. What I mean by that is a film in which Jack smirks and cracks wise for two hours in the same way he's been doing the last few years. ""The Pledge"" is not in the same vein as recent serial killer movies because it isn't about the killer, the crimes or even the effects of the murders - it's a deep psychologocial character study of one man's using his own unrelenting hunt for absolution and justic as a means for getting up in the morning. And Jerry Black (Nicholson) is not clever Jack - he's acting Jack. Director Penn gives the film a deliberately slow pace that starts out with a bang and then BUILDS to a complex and stunning climax. The audience wants to solve the mystery, but the filmmakers are not interested in who the killer is, the filmmakers are intrigued by the perverse lengths Jerry Black will go to give himself a reason for being. Believe it or not, the main thrust of the movie (the serial killer) is more like a sub-plot, it's Black's personal descent that is the focus of the movie. I personally am a fan of both intense mystery/thrillers and deep character studies, so having a really profound look at the typical ""cop"" role was fresh. Nicholson shines in the role of Jerry Black, the only problem being that no matter how great an actor Nicholson is, he's still Jack Nicholson, and in the back of every viewer's mind they won't forget that he's still Jack. That makes some of Black's questionable behavior and motives even more uncomfortable, because even if an audience is used to seeing Jack smirk his way through questionable moral territory, they've never seen him REALLY bathe in it with a serious face. Yet, the film has to stand on it's own, despite any pre-conceived notions a viewer might have regarding it's content or genre. For me, it was a breath of fresh air, and the DVD release will supply more oxygen during the long summer of Michael Bay and his filmmaking brethren suffocating us with abundant special effects and hula-hoop plot holes. ""The Pledge"" is an emotional investment that, depending on how one likes their movies, may or may not pay off. It certainly did for me, and if nothing else just watch it for what is the defining moment of this phase of Jack Nicholson's career.",991008000,7,2953,4.460258780036969

1284673,2,B00003CXSH,"The 1994 original movie ""The Cold Light of Day"" is significantly better than Sean Penn's interpretation.  I knew ""The Pledge"" was a bomb when a couple of viewers  in different parts of the theater remarked on how lousy it was.  The film left the Houston area about one week later headed for box office oblivion.  Sean Penn made a  horrible mistake in in keeping secret the identity of the sex deviate.  This was frustrating to say the least and made the rest of the film seem pointless.  Jack Nicholson  did a good job as the alcoholic retired detective who pledges to a mother that he will find the killer of her daughter.  However, Penn has Nicholson play the role of Jerry Black in such a  manner as to suggest that the police officer committed himself to the case not so much as to solve it, but because the man has nothing better to do.  Nicholson's  character comes across as an existentially challenged individual who needs to find a purpose to make his life worth living.  The murdered girl is merely an excuse to  justifying getting up in the morning.
Penn's real life wife Robin Wright Penn is very convincing as the mother who accepts the generosity of the much older retired officer.  Initially she seeks only a  relationship which will secure a loving home for the young girl.  A sort of romance soon develops between the two adults which seems only to bewilder and  overwhelm the man.  Wasn't the recent Academy Award winner Benico Del Toro, you might ask,  also in the movie?  Del Toro merely has about a five minute part  indulging in histrionic mannerisms as a mentally retarded man falsely suspected of a vile crime.  Penn essentially wasted this great actor's enormous talent. The other  actors do little to balance out the deficiencies of Penn's directing.
I can give ""The Pledge"" only two stars.  Only the true fans of Jack Nicholson will find it worth viewing.  The previously mentioned ""The Cold Light of Day,"" though,  is highly recommended (four stars) as a something of a hidden gem.  Rudolf Van Den Berg aptly directs this virtually unknown movie in an intelligent and exciting  manner.  The audience actually gets to understanding the sick motivations of the child killer. Van Berg's direction is not pretentious, and he accomplishes a lot with  almost certainly a smaller budget.  Sean Penn should seek instruction and guidance from Van Berg before he attempts another film.",990316800,5,2403,4.785365853658536

The Pledge drags throughout..is much to vague in its point and manages to accomplish nothing. Nicholson's performance is solid, if not off kilter. Even the emotional struggle within the character was much more defined in The crossing guard. overall I was very dissapointed in this movie I had impatiently waited for.

The screenplay is brilliantly written.  Like all great movies, it's all about the screenplay.  The Pledge does not rely on sex, violence or special effects.  There are some scenes of gore because of the subject matter, but the movie is almost apologetic about the crime scenes while demonstrating that it's necessary to see the imagery.

Without getting into the story or any spoilers, suffice it to say that this is a thinking person's movie.  Pay attention and keep track of the characters, and you will appreciate this suspense thriller.",1492560000,,861,4.6490066225165565
