2322835,4,B0009UZGDW,"I approached this movie with a little trepidation having been so impressed by the earlier, very stylistic movie, Subway. Not wishing to draw comparisons between the two I focussed on this movie in total and was quite impressed with what I found.

The storyline is another in a long line of critiques of the new capitalist order where the metaphor for the old planned socialist economy was the Moscow Metro where there was no such thing as garbage strewn everywhere and where the passengers were behaved and orderly as they would be in such a society. This was replicated elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc but of course, with the collapse of state communism or whatever you may wish to term it, that comlicity and order has apparently broken down.

In such a new world the fragmentation and change is personified by the characters who inhabit theis movie. They are contasted by the sheer stark beauty of the subway system itself in Budapesht where the filmmaker stalks every mile to find stupendous shots of systemic beauty and individuality as integral parts of the oderly system while the inevitable failings of humans under the new system are bared for all to see.

The filmmaker reminds us of his portrayals of good versus evil, black versus white throughout the story in many different ways. His primary characters inhabit a netherworld below ground much like the Morlocks of Wells in the Time Machine. They are often in conflict, many times as dirty denizens of a decaying police force versus those who wish to cheat the sytem to get ahead. The characters which stand out are the three dimensional travellers in conflict while regular humans do not seriously enter the picture.

The outlook is mainly dreary and depressing. The muderer who stalks the subways killing for no apparent reason is the central plot attached to which are the overarching themes and characterisations that the filmaker wishes to prtray. In the end good triumphs over bad and the hero and heroine ascend the escalator into the light in a very moral and religous symbolism, leaving the subway behind.

We take much of our freedoms for granted in the West and it is hard to imagine that the people's of Eastern Europe wished to be free to endure hardship and degredation. The message from this movie however, is one of hope. The hardship and degradation are bearable if people can fight their way out of it. It they can achieve that act itself is infinitely preferable to the ongoing death of a thousand regulations under state socialism.

This is a very thought provoking film and clearly there are issues about capitalism and liberalism in the classical sense, but the overall preference for freedom and for hope is a very strong message to send indeed.",1125532800,7,2729,4.832976445396145
2322836,5,B0009UZGDW,"I will now tell you about the most awesome movie to hit the current world cinema scene: ""Kontroll.""

  The basic plot involves Bulcsu, who leads a rag-tag team of ticket-checkers.  Having dropped-out of his successful above-ground life, he wanders underground in search of redemption and a way back into the light. His bosses are shady interrogators who try to strong-arm their employees into discipline.  Things go haywire when a mysterious entity compels people to jump onto the tracks in front of the high-speed trains--or is the figure pushing them?

  Having been in Budapest and traveled on its subway system, the film had special meaning for me.  Yet, this movie is visually-stunning. The light from everday life streaming down the subway escalators is unforgettable.  The chase sequences are amazingly well done. The whole movie can be interpreted as symbolic escape from communism and Hungary's quest for self-determination and identity, with lots of contempt for authoritative interrogation and an emphasis on murky existential subterranean wanderings. Lots of symbolism, like the serial killer and the angel, and superb acting.

  It has an electrifying soundtrack, and if you're into screenplay, you'll recognize this film as masterful work--check out some of the production photos!",1124150400,4,1294,5.442211055276382
2322837,5,B0009UZGDW,"Part of the reason I liked this movie so much is the Hungarian language itself. The vulgarities were very colorful, sad to see that so many of them were lost in translation.

I also really enjoyed the setting of the film; the Budapest subway system gave an interesting beckgound to the story. (see previous reviews)

And the story? I was confused about it for a while. True, it doesn't solve the murder mystery, but I don't think it's really supposed to be solved. To me it rather seemed to tell an allegory of someone going insane, of loosing grip on reality.

Konroll faintly resembled Jacob's Ladder. It evoked the same kind of confusion and thought process to make sense of it. I think this is the biggest reason I liked it.",1119916800,4,728,4.541984732824427
2322838,5,B0009UZGDW,"Somewhere along the line between black comedy, dark thriller and surreal drama lies this unique, incredibly original film from Hungary. First feature film for 30 year old writer/director Nimrd Antal, Kontroll spans comedy, tragedy, suspense and romance, but both the surreal story about a series of random murders in the Budapest Undergroung, and the unreal, dreamy love story take second place to atmosphere, style and symbolisms, all of which this film has by the barrelful. It's not that there's a lack of plot - there's actually a remarkable amount of it, and of characters - but the plot isn't really the main issue. It's quite unclear, actually, what parts of the story are real, what is part of the protagonist's rambling imagination and what is entirely symbolic; and frankly, it doesn't really matter.

The protagonist is Bulcs (Sndor Csnyi), a Subway controller who had lost his connection with reality and with the real world in the dark, timeless reality of the underground tunnels underneath Budapest. It's appropriately claustrophobic and distressing, with bleak, dark cinematography and hard, throbbing semi-electronic music to match. And while the film feels sometimes like a Danny Boyle, sometimes a Guy Ritchie and sometimes a David Fincher, it isn't by any means inconsistent or uneven. It's a film that keeps you off-balance, at times incredibly funny, at others deeply depressing, scary or touching, and with its surreal atmosphere it draws the viewer in completely. It's low-budget and low-key, and to the very end you'll never stop wondering what exactly the director is trying to tell you, to make you think or feel; and that's the beauty of it. Kontroll is a fantastic piece of cinema that deserved more than the recognition it got in the US.",1119571200,,1767,5.114186851211072
2322839,5,B0009UZGDW,"I know it was released in 2004, but I didn't have a chance to see it in theaters until this year, and I have to say it was my third favorite of the year so far, behind only Batman Begins and Sin City.

I thought the location and cinematography was excellent.  The whole movie takes place in the metro (or subway) stations.  It has a definitive noir style to it.  Very dark and filtered lighting.

It doesn't follow an exact plot so much as it just follows the main characters through their daily lives on the job.  They are the ticket inspectors, and they are split up into teams.. and while some of the teams get along, others are less then subtle about their dislike for each other.

While there is not necessarily a main plotline, within the story the main characters (Bulcs's team) deal with a young prankster named Bootsie, a fellow inspector who takes a turn to the psychotic, an anxiously competitive leader of another team, and (mainly) mysterious occurances of people jumping, or being pushed rather, in front of the subway cars.  All the while the main character, Bulcs becomes fascinated with a young woman dressed in a bear outfit.

The soundtrack is spectacular and I love the way it was used in the movie, it is definitely the euro-sounding trance/techno.  The acting was exceptional, but not phenominal.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys foreign films, film-noir, or dark comedies.",1119398400,2,1448,4.729083665338646
2322840,3,B0009UZGDW,"""Kontroll"" is the first Hungarian film on the Cannes Film Festival in 20 years, it is also one of the few Hungarian films I have seen. What makes the second statement so odd is the fact that I am Hungarian. Now of course I realize just because I'm Hungarian that doesn't mean I have to like Hungarian films just as someone who is Italian doesn't have to like Italian films or someone who is German doesn't have to like German films or someone who is French...well you get the picture. But the difference with me is I like international films just that we rarely get to see Hungarian films nowadays.

 ""Kontroll"" is filmed entirely inside the Hungarian subway system, the largest in the world and one of the oldest. The movie follows a group of ""ticket inspectors"" headed by Bulcsu (Sandor Csanyi, and if my Hungarian is correct, which I doubt, Sandor is Alex in Hungarian). We meet these inspectors and see the whole new world unravel before our eyes. The director, Nimrod Antal, makes the subway the real star of the film. We enter a world that Kafka or Camu should have written about. Around every corner we are suspious because there seems to be a killer running around who pushes people onto the train tracks right before it arrives. So far 7 people have been killed in a month. But who could it be? And why are they doing it?

 To be honest ""Kontroll"" doesn't focus so much on that plot line. The movie almost seems plot-less. What Antal seemed most interested in is showing us the subway and capturing some truly impressive visual shots. The visuals will probably stay in your head a lot longer than the actually story, which to be honest is kind of weak. Though it didn't have to be if the movie would have focus more on the thriller aspect of the plot.

 Nimrod Antal claims this, his first film, was inspired by Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"", and like the Tarkovsky film one wonders if what we are seeing in ""Kontroll"" is real or a dream. How much of this movie is reality? There are not many clues given about who the killer is but the movie starts to lead us on the trail of Bulcsu. Does he have a split-personality? Or is he dreaming it?

 ""Kontroll"" is a film that is rich in atmosphere and detail. I think a good number of those who see this movie will enjoy it for those reasons alone even though the story leaves something to be desired. Antal shows great promise as a filmaker, has he has a good eye for visuals. I can't wait to see what else is in store for us in the future.

 Bottom-line: A film rich in atmosphere and detail takes us to an underground world, literally and captures our interest. Not one of the year's best but one you should seek out nonetheless.",1118793600,4,2676,4.4317718940936865
2322851,5,B0009UZGDW,"Great movie!  They've taken something as mundane as subway ticket inspection and made it fast, adventurous and exciting.  It's like ticket inspection fused with the elements from ""Hackers"" and ""Go"".  Awesome soundtrack too.",1300147200,,223,5.696969696969697

2322855,4,B0009UZGDW,"What was easily one of the most original films of the past 10 years, Kontroll should hold its position well into the present decade. With the 2003 release of Kontroll, young writer and director Nimrod Antal took the basic setting of the Budapest metro system (he is, apparently, one of very few filmmakers ever granted permission to shoot there) and turned it into a self-contained universe, featuring the strangest cast of characters Hungary has to offer. As we follow the protagonist Bulcs in his day-to-day responsibilities as a ticket taker, meet his co-workers, and watch him develop friendships with odd individuals who seem to spend all of their time in the Budapest underground, we get the impression that he has not seen daylight in a long time. On top of this, Bulcs both chases and is plagued by a subterranean specter, Shadow, a nightmarish hooded figure who pushes passengers from the platform into oncoming trains. Antal interweaves this plotline with such subplots as romance with a girl in a bear suit, the pursuit of notorious fare-jumpers through the trains and tunnels, secret underground raves, death-defying rail runnings, and the insanity-inducing effects of a subterranean existence, demonstrating an immense understanding of and appreciation for multiple film genre in the process. In this film, Antal argues his candidacy as one of the most promising filmmakers of his generation, though his follow-ups have been less compelling (Vacancy, Armored, Predators). Even in Vacancy and Predators, you can see the development of a potential master of the horror/thriller genre, and I maintain that, despite the supposed ""sophomore slump,"" we can expect big things from him in the future. Four and one-half stars to the very tall Hungarian man from Los Angeles.",1284076800,,1778,5.22027972027972
2322856,5,B0009UZGDW,"Heres a movie that blindsided me a few years ago when I caught it on Showtime and rewatched it when it ran three hours later. Kontroll is one of those movies I recommend to anyone adventurous enough not to be turned off by subtitles, a hybrid of police procedurals set in the underground tunnels of Budahpest's subway system. Its the debut film of Nimrod Antal, the talented director who in my opinion has made mediocre Hollywood films but this is one that keeps me hoping that He'll make another film this great.
I described it in terms of police procedural though that hardly really matters. Despite the killings commited by a hoody wearing killer the movies real concern is focusing on this ragtag group of ticket collectors, lead by Bulscu, a man who's quietly unravelling living underground. Theres a rival team of takers who been given top honors of a new uniform, an angry stupid chief to yell at Bulscu, and a strung out Controller who's apt to sna fro the tension of the job. Then theres the intriguing woman Szofi wandering around the metro in bear suit riding the train driven by her father, Bela. With all thats going on its little wonder the film opens with a statement from a spokesperson from the transit authority reading a statement before the titles roll.
The movie shouldn't really be described plotwise and probably can't in a way as it mixes so many genre like comedy, horror, and thriller. The real reason to see the movie is Antal's direction which makes the movie an odd and surreal experience but mostly grounded never really spinning the plot out of direction. The movie itself was made for little money shooting on real locations and taking advantage of Antal's ability to turn real world enviroments into totally alien landscapes the characters wander around. He apparently also shoots for the moment as a famous scene involving Bulscu and foe racing on the rails after a train was shot with a real train.
The acting is good, the music great, and the movie is a entertaining film. And now for the problem; if you've read reviews for the DVD you know its complete utter crap. I bought the movie for itself but the image is non-amorphic and blurry. The sound is loud and hollow which dampens everythingg. Truthfully I bought into the notion that somehow the movie was recorded off of a videotape. Its that bad. And don't even wish for an extra (a commentary would be excellent). Hopefully seeing as the disc is out of print, hopefully we'll get a Blu-Ray soon to fix all the DVD's problems. As a fan of the movie I hope so.",1279756800,,2549,4.6415929203539825

2322858,4,B0009UZGDW,"When I read the cable description of the movie ""A hooded figure pushes people in front of oncoming trains,"" I wasn't sure I'd be able to watch it.  I thought it was a horror movie.  I'm glad I took the time to see it.  It's become one of my favorite movies, and one of the few foreign movies where the sub-titles not only don't bother you, you really don't even need them to know what's going on.  It's extremely well acted, and you get such a strong sense of who the characters really are.  If you just watch it as a movie, it's a really interesting picture, but if you really take the time to think about what you're seeing, you'll see the existentialism, the metaphors and understand it's really about the classic struggle not only of good and evil, but how deep that is within every person.

There are no pat answers, the end is basically yours to decide.  It's whatever you want to believe.  For a first time director, it's a triumph.  Upon researching the making of the movie, I found that it was entirely filmed in the Budapest subway.  They could only film very late at night after the trains had stopped running.  When you see the main character in one scene running uphill in the subway, he's actually him navigating the wires and tracks and breathing in all the soot and hot air.  Despite the fact they are all speaking Hungarian, you get a better bead on everyone's character better than in a lot of movies where you can actually understand what people are saying, which speaks to how well acted it is.  It's not a murder mystery really, although people do die (you never actually see it), but as the movie unfolds, it's less about the dying than it is about the living.  For the most part, the movie is not comedic, but there are some very, very funny parts in it.  Even now when the movie comes on and I see certain scenes, I still laugh just as hard.  The comedy isn't used so much to break the tension, as it is a window into each person's issues and how they deal or don't deal with their situation of working in this grimy underworld.  The music is reminiscent of 80's techno, which I'm not a fan of, but I actually liked it.  It's haunting and creates the mood.  This movie will appeal to a lot of people just as it is, but if you're a thinker and can abstract think a bit, I think you'll really find this interesting and worth seeing more than once.  The more you see it, the more you see and pick up, and the more you understand the ending and all the symbolism throughout the whole movie.",1213228800,6,2510,4.322649572649572

2322871,4,B0009UZGDW,"Many people have already written about what this film is about so I will not say any more on that.  I will state simply that this is a wonderful film, one of my favorites from 2005 (the year it played in my local theater), and it is exciting, thought provoking, and often very funny.  I went into it originally knowing almost nothing about it and was delighted at what I saw.  So much so that I went to see it a second time later in the week before it was gone.

All of that said I was thrilled to get it on DVD.  But my thrill turned to slight disappointment when I realized that not only was it a barebones DVD as far as extras go (there are absolutely no extras at all), and not only were the subtitles burned into the image (i.e. non-removable), but it was also a non-anamorphic transfer.  In fact the only saving grace for this disc (besides the exceptional film) is that the burned in subtitles are over the film image rather than the black letterboxing.  This means that when played on a widescreen TV, and zoomed in to fill the entire screen (to compensate for it not being anamorphic) the subtitles are clearly readable and do not get cut off.  But it is completely unforgivable for ANY DVD to be released in the year 2005 with a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer, and burned in subtitles.  Unforgivable.  And on top of that the film is not inexpensive by any means.  Amazon sells it for $24.99 (at the time of this writing), and I purchased it in store for about $28.  If it was any other film I would have returned it if at all possible, and been a lot more scathing in my review.  But since I absolutely love this film I can only be disappointed that it received about the worst possible DVD release it could get.  The only thing that could have made it worse would be if it was only available in a so called ""fullscreen"" version and not widescreen at all.  But having averted that absolute catastrophe scenario they settled on the next worst DVD release they could manage.  I'm considering tracking down a much better foreign version I've heard about.

(UPDATE EDIT) Since writing me review I have noticed that the price of this DVD has significantly dropped.  As of now (December 2008) it is only $7.99 on Amazon.  Taking this into account I can more highly recommend the DVD even given the overwhelming lack of quality presentation I talk about in the review.  Sure it is still a shame that this excellent film wasn't presented better on it's DVD, but not as big of a shame as it was when it originally cost $28.  This movie, even given this shamefully lackluster DVD release, is well worth $7.99.",1186099200,21,2613,4.436058700209643
2322872,5,B0009UZGDW,"Highly original release has the nihilist feel of futuristic sci-fi, as the Budapest subway system gives off a decaying, lifeless aura. Yet unexpectedly, the odd-ball fraternity of ticket-checkers manage to inject their bleak surroundings with a therapeutic dose of humanity and humor. Though suspenseful and atmospheric, the film's black comedy is its most successful, intriguing asset, with Bulscu's hilarious co-workers Muki (Csabu Pindroch) and the Professor (Zoltan Musci) worth the price of admission all on their own. Definitely a movie-and a director-worth watching. (Don't miss opening scene on escalator.)",1184889600,3,614,5.910112359550562
2322873,4,B0009UZGDW,"In the Prologue, the narrator relates that his friend director, Nimrod Antal, has made a film about the struggle between good and evil.  Using the Hungarian subway system as symbol, they jump start `Kontroll,' (Control), an innovative movie almost exclusively taking place on or near train platforms.  In which case, the underground system is hell on earth with its Satan being a black hooded hoodlum morbidly seeking victims to push onto the tracks to collide with oncoming trains.  Surveillance cameras abound all over, yet the subway executives (or ""suits"" as they call them) can't seem to put their finger on the epidemic of alleged suicides they are unable to avert.  In between some confrontational scenes, there is plenty going on to keep our attention.  Besides being unique, 'Kontroll' has that rare ability to mix laughs, tenderness, and brutality with jarring shifts in a way that actually works.  (No wonder Hungary's box office made this movie their homegrown 'Star Wars'.)

The focus starts with a drunken women who stumbles alone on the underground platform, comically fumbling with opening a bottle of champagne.  Abruptly, we soon see nothing left of her but half a high-heeled shoe remaining after a high speed train passes.  Next, we come to an apparent homeless man, leaning against a post.  A man gently tells him that he has a bloody nose.  To which he has seemingly stirred belligerence, only we find he is a ticket inspector, Bulscu' (Csany Sa'ndor), who makes the station his home.  At first hard to like, his toughness fades later to a good-natured presence, especially given the nature of his position facing rough colleagues and customers.  No wonder.  For the gruffness, many vignettes show the thankless job of getting customers to pay.  Given the prologue's disclaimer of ""fiction over fact"" [to paraphrase], we certainly are given a vision of purgatory to boot.  The morning meeting finds Bulscu' has overslept, but he doesn't miss much with a surly supervisor assigning tasks and urgently lecturing them to save suicidal people jumping onto the tracks.  Then, the dreary atmosphere turns to color with myriads of passengers who evade and harass the ticket inspectors.  Just a partial cross-section, we get gays and women who flirt with the inspectors to pass on payment with dialogue that is always witty and ""fresh"".  One decent passenger is a beautiful woman patron who wears a bear costume.  (One well-edited scene has the employees going to mandatory psychologist sessions.  Besides making us laugh, they inadvertently provide a better reason than Michael Moore to have a universal health care system--no matter which side you take on the issue.)

`Kontrol' is a unique movie ride.  It could easily have been too bleak, but the variety of development is well constructed.  Besides balancing the atmosphere, the transition from surreal to stark realism is nearly ingenious without derailing the plot.  `Kontroll' is a quirky film that delivers colorful laughs as well as a menacingly dark atmosphere that is sure to give one gooseflesh.  Besides that, I am partial to the way they draw from American chase scenes, like French movie, L'Enfant, yet managing to provide their own playful twists.  'Kontroll' is a movie that matters.

(Special thanks to fellow reviewer, Michael Acuna, who--besides being a tireless resource--recommended this hidden gem and put it on the map.)",1180051200,5,3409,5.149090909090909
2322874,5,B0009UZGDW,"This film has hillarious characters but I would not classify it as a comedy. This piece kind of exists on its own plane. It has an ""in your face"" feel of the characters (reminicent of ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"") but they are in some fantasy underground subway world.

Kontroll follows a group of ticket collectors who seems to spend no time above ground. Especially the main character, who sleeps in the terminal and doesn't look to have seen sunlight in too long a time. The whole theme of being underground is very metaphorical. Many characters are symbolic in ways too.

It is quite a dreampiece, but not too fantastic. We go odd places and meet the denizens of the underground. Some people are kind, others you wouldn't want to be alone with. Especially one mysterious character who stalks the underground and shoves people down to the tracks and to their deaths.

Kontroll has an interesting pace to it. It's fast, but not too fast. It moves like a subway would. Quickly, then a short stop, then moving on again.

I really felt a warmth towards this film. It is oddly touching at times, hillarious at others. All the characters are well thought out and well acted. It is well balanced, complete and left me feeling positive.",1177459200,2,1239,4.669724770642202

The film does an excellent job of depicting the controllers interactions with the subway riders. The controllers meet everyone from the needle wielding madman to a girl in a teddybear costume, who Bulcsu stikes up an endearing romance. The funniest parts of the film are when the controllers encounter ""Bootsey"", a young punk who gets his kicks by tormenting Bulcsu's gang. This leads to some of the best ""On foot"" chase scenes I've seen. The main plot of the film is when the Controllers discover that a mysterious hooded figure is pushing people infront of trains. When Bulcsu is suspected of comiting these murders, he decides to go on a hunt for the hooded one to prove his innocence. or is it a hunt for self discovery?

2322877,4,B0009UZGDW,"Even if you have never actually ridden on one of those amazing steep, deep, and dangerously fast Budapest Metro escalators that swoop you down from street level deep into their subway system, I urge you to take a virtual journey into an imaginative and quirky cinematic world every bit as fantastic as Alice's adventures ""underground.""

This film is a funny and funky thriller but certainly has very little to do with the real Metro system in Hungary's capital city.

Yes, in Budapest they really do have control agents who ride along incognito and then suddenly whip out their official armbands and start checking for passengers onboard without valid tickets -- but just like the earlier American film ""Repo Man"" (a similarly despised way to make a living) this film is hardly a slice of ""real"" life or meant to be!

In fact, one of the funniest bits in the film -- and the first thing you see -- is a poker-face statement read by what we're told is a representative of the Hungarian Metro system reminding us that what we're about to see is more a parable of good and evil than a depiction of actual events or conditions in the Hungarian Metro system.

The humor is dark, but anyone who really and truly hates their current job (or suffers from bouts of depression in general) will probably identify with the controllers in this film -- especially if the hated job involves interactions with the public at large!

Like a number of other Hungarian films I've been watching recently, the characters are both wildly eccentric but quite charming innocents at heart (in a perverse sort of way, or course).

Yes, there is depictions of ""sex and violence"" in this film, but not anything as graphic as what's on American TV every evening, and these scenes are handled with a discrete finesse that is quite impressive. For example, there are some tarty underground prostitutes in the film, but a girl who rides the subway in a bulky pink Teddy Bear costume (think Barnie, not a Playboy bunny) is hero's love interest and sexier than anything in a skimpy skirt!

If you enjoy foreign films in general, try this one for sure. As for me, I'm rapidly becoming hooked on Hungarian films -- and (despite my pen name) I'm not even Hungarian!",1167782400,6,2227,4.694871794871795
2322878,5,B0009UZGDW,"First of all, this film is extremely beautiful and has incredible music.  Against this background, teams of 5 ticket inspectors roam a fictionalised Budapest subway.  Our hero, Bulscu, is teamed with a narcoleptic, Tibor the new guy, a talkative guy, and a guy in a sweater (some of the characters don't seem to have names).  Bulscu has run away from his white collar past & now is running away from his current life, sleeping in the subway instead of his apartment.  He's worried about competition (the subtitling has to choose important information to go wonky during) but still won't back down from challenges from his fellow inspectors.

Meanwhile, a hooded man in black is pushing people under trains.  Bulscu is accused of being him and must fight him in the last 6 minutes of the film, which nevertheless contain a satisfying battle.  This is a very strange film, and I haven't figured all of it out, but it is very beautiful and not at all boring.  There's lots of comedy in it.

2322879,4,B0009UZGDW,"Honestly, I can't say I've seen a story quite like this. It seems like a mixture of the subway scenes in Ghost with a bit of the type of story Neil Gaiman would like.

A young man works and lives in the Budapest underground subway system, unable to leave until he purges himself of some mysterious past and defeats evil. In likelihood, this is a parable about personal hell and the ongoing fight between good and evil. It is scattered with wise sages, owls, rival gangs, and a woman in a bear suit.

On a more literal level, it presents a group of people with one of the worst jobs in the world. ""Everyone hates us,"" is true as they work day by day to check tickets and everyone from the common person to the aristocrats and pimps give them sass and refuse to work with them. The pure discomfort of that line of work is presented very strongly, leaving it somewhat difficult for the viewer to remain simply comfortable while watching the movie.

In terms of quality, it seems to go all over the spectrum from really gripping to ho-hum. For a long time despite its overall entertainment value it doesn't really seem to have much going on with it, until the end. This would be one I'd suggest you stick out to the end, even if you're not liking it initially. It should pay off.

2322880,5,B0009UZGDW,"THE PREMISE: The protagonist Bulscu (played by Sndor Csnyi who reminded me of Chris Noth -- ""Mr. Big"" in Sex In The City) is an attractive, yet conflicted young man working as a conductor in the Budapest subway system.  As with many European transit systems, entry is on the honor system -- each passenger is supposed to buy a proper ticket, but there are no entrance gates or barriers.  Bulscu is a member of an enforcement team who rides the rails and spot checks that passengers hold proper tickets or are otherwise entitled to ride. In spite of having had a successful career up on the surface, Bulscu hides from something -- living, leeping,remaining underground.
THE FILM: Shot completely in the Budapest subway system, the film depicts Bulscu's community -- people who travel, work, eat, rest, party and even have sex underground -- and his own private hell: Russian mobsters, gang members, co-workers ranging from macho-idiot rivals to narcoleptics, plus other assorted madness and mayhem.  Hopefully, this is a hyperbolic commentary on the social upheaval endured by rapidly-changing Eastern block countries.
THE AMBIGUITIES: ""Kontroll"" presents a fast-moving and occasionally-humorous, eerie twilight world of endless tunnels and light-deprivation, where one can't be entirely sure who are the good guys and the bad guys.  Unlike Hollywood's simplistic story formulas, ""Kontroll"" leaves lots of ambiguity: is there a psychotic murderer pushing victims onto the tracks?  is there an inner demon turning Bulscu into a push-happy murderer?  is death making a phantom appearance forcing our protagonist to face his own mortality?  will his love interest tempt Bulscu to venture back up and out into the light and life?  I won't ruin the ""ending,"" but if this were typical Hollywood crap, there are enough loose ends to make for ""Kontroll 2,"" Return To Kontroll,"" ""Revisiting Kontroll"" and so on.
THE NET: I enjoyed it immensely on a number of levels -- artistic, social commentary, visuals, and pure entertainment -- and suggest you will too.  It's certainly worth a rental at least.",1143849600,6,2089,5.193452380952381
2322881,5,B0009UZGDW,"Kontroll is simply fantastic, as you can already tell from the other reviews; I'm just writing to warn that *this* DVD has absolutely no special features.

The Hungarian version has two discs, anamorphic transfer (lacking in the version offered here), and plenty of special features (including deleted scenes, short behind-the-scenes feature, and two entire short films by director Nimrod Antal).

Don't worry about the fact that it's the Hungarian version, the film still offers subtitles in a few languages including, naturally, English.  Also, virtually all of the extras have English subtitles.

I don't know why that edition is not easily available in the States, and I haven't found any good seller of the 2-disc version yet, so if you don't care about special features, the one-disc U.S. version is fine. =)  Hopefully Amazon.com will pick up an Americanized 2-disc set eventually.",1142985600,8,888,5.2695035460992905

Simply put, it's about one person escaping their self-imposed personal hell by beating death (literally) before death gets him. Throw in a some terrific acting, an arresting score of songs and brilliant film composition, and you have ""Angel Heart"" meets ""The Taking of Pelham 123.""

2322883,4,B0009UZGDW,"Ever since I condemned myself to riding the subway to and from my job 5 days a week for 8 ghastly years until I came to my senses and left Manhattan, subways have always struck me as a man-made hell. That's what the main character of this genuinely different film from Hungary has banished himself to: A hellish subway inspector's job in a nightmare hole in the ground from which he can escape merely by hopping on an escalator and riding up into the light, but it takes him 105 minutes of screen time to decide to do it.

Be honest with you, it felt more like 205 minutes to me while I was watching it. Time doesn't exactly fly by in a nightmare of the type where you keep running and running and don't seem to get anywhere while the Thing that's on your tail keeps advancing on you. To stop such a nightmare, it often takes becoming the hunter instead of the hunted, going after the monster and leading it into a trap instead of allowing it to terrorize you until you're too weak to run anymore.

Don't know quite what the protagonist's problem is in ""Kontroll,"" or which monkey he's got on his back, or why he's banished himself to an impossible job he hates and for which he is hated, or what he fears about the light, but for 80% of this movie I was fascinated because his problem is everybody's problem. His story is Everyman's and Everywoman's story who's had to come to terms with mortality. ""Kontroll"" has a few amusing moments, sure, but a comedy it isn't.

The film's pacing should have been much tighter, but the acting is almost uniformly superb, with the leading male actor a mesmerizing standout. I could have done without the simpering female lead in the teddy bear suit; mesmerizing, she isn't, though perhaps she just needs a stronger director. The soundtrack is terrific. The photography of the Budapest subway system is breathtaking (and somewhat heartbreaking). The Hungarian language spoken is rich and fertile, and the subtitles are never obtrusive.

5 stars for concept, content, and acting. 3 stars for directing. All in all, a 4-star, highly unusual film well worth seeing, even if it is 20% longer than it needs to be.",1131926400,8,2145,4.578125

2322885,4,B0009UZGDW,"How many people in the US (or in a whole lot of other countries, for that matter) know that the Budapest subway system is one of the oldest in the world? That's the setting for this film, and it starts, interestingly enough, with a disclaimer by an actual employee of the subway system who talks about his organization's cooperation in working with the film director, Nimrod Antal, in making the film.

The setting functions as much more than a setting here; it creates the atmosphere, and restricts and constricts the characters--most of whom are ticket inspectors, or controllers--in a confined self-imposed semi-prison in which they eat, sleep, work, talk, and even find romance.

Muki, a big slob, loves greasy food and is narcoleptic. Bootsie, our (sort of) hero, meets a young woman in a teddy bear costume who turns out to be the daughter of Bootsie's ""uncle"", Bela, who is a train driver and with whom his daughter sometimes rides, telling him how much she loves being with him. Gonzo is the leader of a rival ticket inspector group whose team is granted the first ""official"" controller 'uniforms' (the others just wear their street clothes and, when on duty, a red arm band to signify their duties). Tibor is a young rookie, learning the ropes, who's part of the controller group that includes Muki, Bootsie, the Professor, and a short guy with a mustache who's overly aggressive.

Scenes of the controllers trying to verify ticket purchase from passengers on and off the train (i.e., in the station) alternate with the controllers themselves talking to each other and dealing with their superiors--a curt, abrupt guy who won't take any BS, and a trio of upper level execs, one of whose face is badly scarred. There's also a love story and a series of brutal killings, both of which converge in some way on Bootsie.

Antal does a fine job here; he's obviously studied filmmaking, seen quite a few films, and knows how to edit and pace the film to give it a punchy modern feel. Techno music alternates with some dark strings, alternating the mood as well. The cinematography is smart--the jump cuts, camera angles and tracking shots are all where and how they should be to keep the viewer glued to the screen.

A great first effort for Mr. Antal. It will be interesting to see what he does next.",1129939200,,2303,4.7475
2322886,4,B0009UZGDW,"Nimrod Antal's impressive directorial debut KONTROLL takes place entirely in the cavernous Budapest subway system and it doesn't take long (about 5 minutes) to feel the weight and dreariness of the place pressing down on you.  By time the film was over I had to go outside and sit by the pond for awhile (those frogs are crazy!).

The Budapest subway is run on the honor system with only a handful of ""controllers"" to walk around randomly checking for tickets.  Bulcsu is a controller; he also never leaves the subway.  At night when his coworkers leave and go to their homes, Bulcsu sneaks off and hides in the dark corners.  KONTROLL is about his life and the Kafka-like quality it has taken on.  Example: people are mysteriously falling in front of the trains Bulcsu thinks it is a serial killer, but nobody but him has ever seen the killer.  Is there really a killer?  Did Bulcsu really see him or was it his imagination or maybe Bulcsu is the killer?  And why is that owl following him around?

By the end I really had no idea what the purpose of it all was since I had more questions than I had answers, but I didn't mind because I had fun the entire way.  I especially enjoyed the scenes of the controllers chasing the non-ticket holders.  Running into walls, knocking people to the ground, breaking stuff they caused more damage and chaos then if they just let the people go.  It's almost like if Charles Bukowski worked at the subway...Wow!...that would have made a great story!

The story of a hapless band of ticket inspectors on the Budapest subway plays like a cross between a love story, an engaging comedy and something by Stephen King. It's evident 'do-it-yourself' qualities are the key to its visual inventiveness and it eminently deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it on the film festival circuit.
This package provides a crisp transfer although there are a few imperfections on the soundtrack. The minimal extras(i.e. none) are disappointing as Antal is an interesting interview subject, and the circumstances of the film's production well-worth hearing about.
All-in-all, however, this is a must have!",1126310400,,772,5.495798319327731
2322889,5,B0009UZGDW,"Ingredients: a bizarre story by Jim Adler and Nimr&oacute;d Antal, a setting completely confined to the compression world of the Budapest subway system, a group of excellent actors, a cinematographer that knows how to take advantage of this amazing setting and push it to its limits, a musical score that knows exactly how to underline the dark comedy, terror, and degenerate feeling of the film. Results: one of the finest films to come out of Central Europe directed with complete 'control' by Nimr&oacute;d Antal!

KONTROLL is the name of those seedy men who patrol the metro guaranteeing that all passengers are ticketed.  The dark order of these Kontrollers is headed by an even darker order of hierarchy whose problems are not limited to enforcement of the ticketing laws, but also preventing the ongoing problem of people jumping (or being pushed...) onto the tracks of the blindly deadly trains.  The Kontrollers are divided into groups, each group covering a different sector of the metro.  And as this metaphor for society plays out, each group is in competition with the other.

One man garners our interest - Bulcs&uacute; (S&aacute;ndor Cs&aacute;nyi) a man weary of his job and the degradation associated with being a Kontroller, so caught up in his life that he never leaves the underground, sleeping and existing in the subterranean world of darkness and artificial light.  The film follows his camaraderie with his 'group', his moments of enlightenment as he meets a pretty woman in a bear suit who just happens to be the daughter of the conductor of his assigned train, and his dangerous encounters with the leader of his 'rival group' with whom he resorts to games of 'chicken' in running through the dangerous tunnels as trains approach.  Ultimately he becomes involved in the chase of a hooded spirit who is thought to be pushing innocent people to their death in front of oncoming trains.

The story, while dark in every sense of the word, in Antal's facile hands mixes comedy with the drama in the way that Shakespeare provided comic relief for his most dramatic plays.  While the real star of the film is clearly S&aacute;ndor Cs&aacute;nyi (he has earned awards for his multifaceted portrayal of a man near madness), special mention is extended to Lajos Kov&aacute;cs, Zolt&aacute;n Mucsi, and the entire ensemble.  The film may be difficult for some to follow or to stay with as it meanders around in the dark, but the rewards are plentiful. This is one of those films whose metaphors visualize post mortem.

This is the bizarre story of subway ticket cops patrolling and harassing subway patrons in Budapest's iconic underground metro (only London's is older). The protagonist, Bulcsu, is the leader of a rag-tag little gang of ticket checkers. The story itself uses a classic thriller/action structure (with a dash of comedy and romance) to great effect. Although the story is by no means incidental it allows the filmmakers take full advantage of the beauty of the subway environment.

8067037,5,B0009UZGDW,"Here we have a little gem of a movie; an art house creation from Hungary, written as a black comedy about a group of ticket inspectors working the (probably) Budapest underground. Doesn't sound particularly promising, does it? Well, I think it's wonderful.

Bulscu (Sndor Csnyi) and his four colleagues (Zoltn Mucsi, Zsolt Nagy, Csaba Pindroch and Sndor Badr) eke a thankless living collecting tickets on the underground. They have to cope with recalcitrant passengers, football hooligans, vandals, dangerous rivalries with other ticket teams and a serial killer who's modus operandi is to creep up behind a commuter and push him or her in front of an approaching train (you'll pay just a little more attention to that old request that you 'mind the gap' next time you use the underground!). That's pretty much it as far as plot goes. Bulscu adds rather more to the story; a tortured soul, he eats and sleeps down below and never sees the light of day (we never really find out why) and falls in love with a mysterious young woman (Eszter Balla) who, for some unexplained reason, travels the metro dressed as a teddy-bear and never buys a ticket. Indeed there is rather a lot that director/writer Nimrd Antal never explains, but none of that really matters.

What you have here is more of a directorial exercise, a character study, a collage of funny, exciting or moving cameos rather than a tightly plotted, meaningful, A-to-C-via-B journey. All the actors play their roles to perfection; funny, pathetic, sociopathic misfits (are they even acting?) and each scene delivers it's laughs, thrills, romance or pathos with mastery and no little heart. The harsh, fluorescent-tube lighting and the grubby, echoing qualities of the metro are used masterfully to develop a surreal, almost post-apocalyptic atmosphere and, because the outside world is barely hinted at, the setting has (I'm stealing shamelessly from other reviewers here) a wierd through-the-looking-glass feel to it that defines the movie.

Overall, it's an enigmatic, rambling, almost pointless movie. Well, almost: having watched it again, the ending has a bit of a Shawshank Redemption vibe to it. However, watching the film is mostly like sitting on a bench in an underground station watching the travellers; where have they come from? where are they going? why are they travelling? is it day or night outside? rainy or sunny? Fascinating and compelling; so many unanswered questions.

Much as I love the film, though, what clinched it for me was what has to be one of the most charmingly delivered disclaimers ever committed to film: the ""head"" of the Budapest Metro reads, rather woodenly, from his clipboard that, while he is proud to support this young Bulgarian director (a good friend, even though they only met recently), ""all events and characters are fictional"" and don't reflect on his beloved Metro system. Fantastic.

Oh yeah: and if you don't believe me, you can find the ""chase scene"" on YouTube and if that doesn't convince you, nothing will.",1323216000,,3022,5.0602409638554215
