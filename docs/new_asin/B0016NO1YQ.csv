8263507,5,B0016NO1YQ,This was the most enjoyable travel video I purchased to view with my grandson prior to our trip to NYC and Boston!  Done with humor and covers more than just the Boston area.  A bit of a stretch but the video takes in Salem and Cape Cod.  Fun to see it all and the narrator sometimes slips in a deep Boston accent.  After watching this video I am looking forward to visiting Boston more than I thought I would.,1403481600,,410,4.151898734177215
8263508,5,B0016NO1YQ,I bought this dvd for my husband who was reared in the greater Boston area.  We have done several touristy-type trips there since that time.  My husband loved the video because it hit most of the spots we remember visitng together.,1364342400,2,231,4.609756097560975
8263509,5,B0016NO1YQ,This tour of Boston was a great trip planning tool for my family and myself.  We really got the overview of the town and were able to make choices together about what we wanted to see.  I really recommend it.,1265241600,3,208,4.175
8263510,1,B0016NO1YQ,"I was hoping to get a video that teaches people about Boston...this is not it. Save your money and look elsewhere. I am a tour guide and this is amateur
and does not meet expectations at all.",1253232000,,191,4.1891891891891895
8263511,5,B0016NO1YQ,"Boston is a city that is a tourist haven.  With its rich historical atmosphere as well as the accouterments of a modern-day metropolis, it would be easy to lose focus and miss out on all the city has to offer.  I was impressed with the way that the video avoided this pitfall by laying out the city in a logical fashion.  While it may be impossible to see all that Boston has to offer in a one week vacation, the video gave me some definite ideas about the things that would make my trip the most meaningful for me and my family.  This is the beauty of the video-that the material is presented as a smrgsbord, and the viewer can choose what to consume in greater detail when they visit.  The due diligence the producers paid in researching the history of Boston was much appreciated as well.",1215043200,5,791,4.35374149659864
