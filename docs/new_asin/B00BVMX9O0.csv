As a serious ""Last of the Summer Wine"" fan those three episodes (IMO) were not only the funniest, but also the saddest!  I cry all the way through every time.

5677739,4,B00BVMX9O0,"""Last of the Summer Wine"" is no ordinary TV sitcom: it's life is measurable in decades, it takes place against the backdrop of some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, and it focuses exclusively on old men (and women).  By the early 90s, the show had become highly formulaic and silly, with plots revolving around variations on themes done numerous times.  The wandering aimlessness and quasi-philosophical/absurdest banter among three old men had long ceased to drive the action of this show.  In the year of the Millennium, Summer Wine would undergo it's most traumatic loss, but from that loss it found some of it's best performances and writing.
Bill Owen infused Compo Simonite with so much joyous, impish energy that he was the undisputed fan favorite of the show.  Owen died in 1999 of pancreatic cancer, not long after filming the funny and touching Millennium special ""Last Post and Pigeon"".  He had been well enough to film a few episodes of the 2000 series and his last episodes are just as funny as the best that Summer Wine had done in the past.  About half-way through this series, Compo dies off screen (hilariously it must be said, but no spoilers!) and for the first time in it's long run, Summer Wine stopped the fun and misadventures and genuinely mourned the death of this scruffy force of nature in wellies.  The three episodes covering his death, ""Elegy for Fallen Wellies"", ""Surprise at Throstlenest"", and ""Just a Small Funeral"" are some of the best episodes of the entire show.  Roy Clarke handled the passing of his most memorable character with an expert balance of humor mixed with bittersweet loss (though oddly enough without a hint of reference to older characters like Foggy).  After Compo is buried, his long-lost son turns up (played by Bill Owen's son Tom) with a mother and daughter in tow.  Tom would stay to continue the link between Summer Wine and his father, but the mother-daughter pair just doesn't fit with this weird little world.
Compo's funeral would have been the perfect time to end this already long-running show.  It would have made perfect sense: the most popular character was dead, and it wasn't like there were any long-running plot arcs to clean up.  Summer Wine would continue on for ten more years.  What was to come wasn't bad, but it would never be the same again...",1420070400,,2333,4.788029925187033

5677756,1,B00BVMX9O0,"If you love Last of the Summer Wine - do NOT buy this DVD or any subsequent DVD's.  In this disk, evidently the actor who plays Compo has died in real life and they work several episodes showing Compo died.  These episode are very sad and touching and fine to watch.  The real horror of this set is in the second disk.  They bring in some really sleazy, strange characters and the feeling of the show changes entirely.  They have already brought in Frank Thornton, of Are You Being Served fame to replace Foggy.  While I think he was fine in Are You Being Served, he is no good in this series.  I guess I should change my original comment and say you would be well advised to buy this set but be sure to throw away the second DVD.  Don't watch it or it will probably ruin the series for you.

5677758,5,B00BVMX9O0,Last of the Summer Wine 1999 was the end of an era.  the 2000 edition was very good but without Compo it was missing a key ingredient.  I am still undecided  whether or not to continue purchasing DVD of this series.  I do remember watching some of the later shows but it will take some time to get over the loss of Bill Owen as the incomparable Compo.,1401840000,,351,4.117647058823529
5677759,5,B00BVMX9O0,"This DVD of 2000 is excellent. This DVD contains the episodes around the funeral of Compo, one of the main characters of the series.",1395360000,,132,4.541666666666667
5677760,4,B00BVMX9O0,"I am a fan of Last of the Summer Wine and have purchased the DVD sets.  The transfers are generally okay, but I am very upset that so many cuts were made on the ""Elegy for Fallen Wellies"" episode among possibly others.  I have seen the full episode and, as at least one other reviewer has noted, some scenes were cut especially from this episode.  Most notably, the opening scene where the ladies of the village were practicing their number for the show at the church they were putting on.  It really helped explain the events leading up to Compo's death.  Also the scene where Truly was passing out the painter's smocks is missing;  a scene where he was handing out one to a single person survived.  It is disappointing to me that the manufacturers of the set saw fit to make such cuts for the sake of not producing a third DVD for the set (my assumption; I can't imagine it was for artistic reasons).  It's not Amazon's fault at all, but true fans of the series should be aware of the cuts. The DVD set would have definitely gotten a 5-start rating from me if it had been complete.",1392076800,,1083,4.353233830845771
5677761,5,B00BVMX9O0,I bought this for my Mum as she loves the series. She was really pleased to receive it so I will buy more of the series for her.,1391817600,,128,3.607142857142857
5677762,5,B00BVMX9O0,"For those who are long-term afficionados of the Last of the Summer Wine, this is the most engaging. Bill Owen (Compo Simmonite) plays his last segments, characters deal with his passing, and then Bill Owen's son is introduced. This is a trophy.",1390435200,,244,4.833333333333333
5677763,3,B00BVMX9O0,"This DVD set is a mixed bag. I agree with most reviewers that the three episodes dealing with Compo's death and funeral are three of the best episodes ever written and acted in the entire run of the show. My beef is that so much has been cut out of the episodes in putting them on the DVD. So much was cut out of ""Elegy for Fallen Wellies"" that the DVD version often seems jerky and unconnected. Originally, this episode began with a charming and hilarious several minutes of the women rehearsing their musical act in their pink costumes. This has been cut completely out of the DVD version -- sadly, because it so perfectly sets up the idea of Compo having a heart attack when he sees Nora in the costume -- and if we haven't seen the costume in the song-and-dance act, the effect suffers. Another instance is that the scene of the passing out of the white painters' overalls by Truly has been cut. The DVD scene shows only one person being handed the overalls, while the original of the episode shows a number of men showing up to receive the overalls, thus making the meaning of the scene at the end more logical. These omissions make me wonder how much has been cut from the other episodes, and even from previous DVDS. The exit of a beloved character and the introduction of his replacement is often awkward; it is more so in this series because there simply is no replacement for Compo, and thus the stories of the new characters just do not seem to fit and are hardly worth watching.

This brings me to something else I've noticed. Two entire series of the program are missing on the DVDs issued in the US, and the dates given on the albums do not coincide with the years the series appeared originally in England. Series 12 (1990, English dates) and Series 16 (1995, English dates), a total of 18 episodes and two specials, have never been issued on DVD in the US. Series 12 welcomes back Foggy to the trio and sees the departure of Seymour (""Return of the Warrior"") and its last episode, ""A Landlady for Smiler"", leads directly into the next series. The US edition picks up with the next season, with Smiler already boarding with Nora Batty, but we have no knowledge of how he got there since that previous season is missing. Series 16 is another Foggy series and contains some very funny episodes. My question is, where are these two seasons and are we ever going to see them issued in US DVDs?

I wonder if anyone else has noticed these omissions? And I hope whoever is issuing the US DVDs will give us a ""catch-up"" album containing these episodes -- I am surprised that, as much as US viewers love the show, nobody else has noticed these omissions and asked that they be issued.",1390262400,3,2690,4.454361054766735
5677764,5,B00BVMX9O0,This DVD is a little more thought provoking as one of the main characters passes on. It is uplifting to see how friends honor a close friend. It speaks to how important friendships are in our everyday lives. Since it is based on actual events it is even more poignant.,1389916800,,268,4.38

5677779,5,B00BVMX9O0,"Every now and then, an actor comes along who simply, with his mere presense, takes over the film or TV show.
Bill Owen was such an actor.
With an excellent career already behind him in Britain's ""Carry On"" comedies back in the 1950s, he burst back on the scene in what would become the longest running sitcom in world history.
Owen always appeared to me to be an actor born out of his time. Like Rowan Atkinson, he would have extremely comfortable in the silent comedies of the 1920s. Bill Owen became the defacto star of Last of the Summer Wine. His playful physical comedy lifted the show in every respect.
For those unfamiliar with the show, I would suggest you start with the episodes from the 1980s on. In these episodes you will meet the, at times very strange, townspeople of Holmfirth in Yorkshire. In fact, you will become so familiar with the town, you will feel you live there yourself. And you might even want to visit it.
If you have never seen the series, do not expect it to be anything like American comedy. American comedy is driven by one-liners, British comedy is story-driven. Do not expect to get the feel of the show with only a few episodes. Stick with it, and you will be pleasently surprised with how easily you are drawn into the world of Roy Clarke's creation.
The 2000 series features the last episodes with Bill Owen, and a three episode story arc dealing with his death, and fittingly for Compo, his serio-comic funeral. These episodes contain the only dramatic moments in the entire series. You will laugh and cry at the same time. A testament to the brilliant creator/writer, Roy Clarke.
Last of the Summer Wine is truly one of Britian's greatest imports to the US. Gentle, pleasent, family friendly comedy that will endure for years.

5677795,3,B00BVMX9O0,"Sorry to throw cold water on some of the glowing reviews here, but I didn't find this DVD very funny.  The first few episodes about Compo's passing were done extremely well and were funny in a way and sad, with great writing and acting, and I did shed a few tears for Compo.  However, the introduction of Compo's long lost son as a character leaves a lot to be desired.  There is absolutely nothing funny, charming, loveable, or redeeming about this con man -- he has none of the qualities that made Compo the old rogue so loveable!  This character actually ruined the last few episodes for me, putting me in an angry and bad mood.  That's not what I buy expensive British comedies for! Thank goodness for the other great actors who all seem to be getting better as the series progresses along.  If this con man becomes a permanent character in the show, I doubt very much that I will be buying more of the DVDs (I have all of the ones released so far).  Toward the end of Foggy's appearances in the series, I really disliked his character too, but he was gold compared to this louse.",1383091200,7,1084,4.39

Also love the ladies who drink their tea at the same time and eat their sweets at the same time and how the younger and more modern girl is always bragging about her husband and how she enjoys their sex life but the older gals think that is disgraceful and unmentionable. Hilarious!  And the lady who runs the tea shop!  And the driver of the car who is SO bad a driver. And the mechanics wife. And Howard's wife who knows just exactly how much to let him get away with and--------I could go on and on. I'm in love with all these people!  Let's not forget the military ""expert"" and Smiler and------------",1383004800,,690,4.333333333333333

8574539,4,B00BVMX9O0,"Was given as a gift.  They enjoy all of the ""Last of the Summer Wine series"" This video was a little sad, that is why 4 stars. They all helped remember Comps life and planning his funeral. He had actually died.  You knew the other actors were deeply effected by his death.  They said he was the glue that held them all together.  Its rare to see that kind of bond in a show.  But the series ran for over 30 years.  We watch it every night. Its cut, its British.  Need I say more. Its not stupid like most of the shows now a days. Its got class.",1492646400,,544,3.9357798165137616
