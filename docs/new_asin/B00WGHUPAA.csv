7132134,4,B00WGHUPAA,"Some characters had to be left out, and the climax lacked a bit because of that. The miniseries did not make you relive the worst parts of the novel, which also made the story come out differently. It was still an enjoyable story, but very different from the book. It's like Martin's ""Songs of Ice and Fire"" verses ""The Game of Thrones"" series. The show is good, but can't really be compared to the books. ""A Casual Vacancy"" is along the same lines. It's totally worth it for fans of the book.",1443484800,3,493,4.369565217391305
7132135,4,B00WGHUPAA,"The acting was very good, and for the most part the movie stuck to the book but I just couldn't help feeling like some things were left out.  May be just me not remembering accurately.  It's a pretty depressing story overall but it does make you think about the vast differences between those who HAVE and want to keep what they have at any cost and those who DO NOT HAVE and how hopelessness leads to bad behavior and desperate measures that have a way to infecting all of society.  The book doesn't really offer any solutions (are there any really?) but it shows that there are always going to be people who do try to help and that there are some in that poverty cycle that CAN be helped and I guess those are who we should focus on.",1441843200,2,735,4.235714285714286
7132136,3,B00WGHUPAA,"I gave up reading the book about a third of the way through.  With 25-ish characters, I had a hard time keeping everyone straight.  Knowing that I needed more of a visual approach, I switched over to the video.  Granted, keeping the characters straight was easier, but still, the overall story was not that entertaining.

Pagford is a village in turmoil since the push to move the lower classes out and a high-class spa in.  The village council is divided, but when Barry Fairbrother dies and his seat on the council becomes available through a casual vacancy chaos ensues.  To complicate matters further, the town explodes when videos and gossipy blog postings run rampant exposing what the members of the council would like to keep hidden.

Multiple stories abound with the towns people fighting amongst themselves, children battling their parents and at the same time, central character Krystal is trying to save her mother.  Add in strong women trying to man-up their husbands and a second stage has been set with nothing is as it seems in this idyllic village.

Abigail Lawrie is a fantastic actress and to be honest she is the only reason that I continued with the second and third episode.  She carries the whole series with her honesty and vulnerability.  Julia McKenzie is a deliciously evil mother-in-law with her snide comments and pixie smile.  Then there is Michael Gambon, how could you not love his pretentious character; he is what drives most people to do the most awful things.

Based on a 500+ page book, I am sure that much was left out of the series, but what was included showed a very sharp picture of how things are never what they appear.  Not a miniseries that I would recommend, but if you do chance watching, do it for Abigail Lawrie alone.  She is the one shinning things in this adaptation.",1441843200,2,1820,4.733333333333333
7132137,5,B00WGHUPAA,"The book was very sad, so I was I little afraid of not being able to sleep after watching  all 3 segments of the movie.  It was sad, but the story was
good, after all, J.K. Rowling wrote it, and the scenery around the village was lovely and there were odd bites of humor.  Worth watching.",1441238400,3,288,4.107142857142857
7132138,3,B00WGHUPAA,"The Casual vacancy is well acted, you've got to give it that, you dislike the villains like your supposed to, such as the meth addict mother who cares more about another hit than the welfare of her toddler son or her teenage daughter who has been forced through circumstance to look after the toddler's welfare. The meth mother, the teenage daughter as well as the domestic violence father dealing out to his sons every time they open their mouths were all very well played by their actors. But well acted doesn't mean entertaining. The TV show (there's credits at the end of each episode), goes for around three and a half hours in total, but once its over you wonder just what the point of it was. A fictional look at the failings of society maybe, especially social services and the criminal negligence of supervisors not following through or worse removing vocal workers from cases when the social workers give them feedback of what's happening behind closed doors, especially when children need to removed. Sure reality is probably more like this than the alternative outcomes for everyone, but if you wanted to see reality of these sorts of societal issues you could just watch the news. If your expecting the good characters to outwit the villains so they'll get their comeuppance, this never happens.

What the Casual Vacancy really needed was some humour, make some of the characters a bit eccentric or something, the social class racist old couple would have benefited from this rather than just being bigots. There is a brief bit of humour with the ghost of Barry computer e-mails but even they are pretty mild and you wonder why no one can work out who is the ghost straight away.

If this wasn't based on a book by a top selling author I don't think it would have been made.",1440460800,3,1787,4.687898089171974
7132139,5,B00WGHUPAA,"Having read the novel twice,  I was curious as to how this dark, compelling tale would be handled on film. The acting is absolutely superb. I liked seeing more of Barry Fairbrother than you do in the book; both at the beginning and  in Krystal's flashbacks/memories. Terri Weedon  was handled beautifully; in her you see the merciless cycle of addiction and its impact on her daughter. The book is considerably darker and I confess to profound relief that the mini-series omitted two of its three most traumatic elements. While the battle for the vacant council seat is the overt focus, to me the heart of the story is the heart-wrenching downspiral of addiction, its impact on the family,  the imperative need for consistent social services and the truly fragile nature of recovery. Author J.K. Rowling shone a bright, unflinching light on this, and she did it with skill and compassion. The mini-series does the same.",1440201600,4,919,4.909677419354839
7132140,3,B00WGHUPAA,"This was one of the  saddest show I have watched. Especially the kids I felt more for them , then any of the adults. Except Barry but as we all know he was not on very long. He was decent , tried to help all the kids. Put the door in for crystal and we do not even know why till the end. Then I was like, poor crystal. And her life so sad.and boy was I rooting for her. She tried so hard. Her and the boys and their hateful bully dad. So sad. After I watched, I was like how depressing, what was the point. But I still watched.",1439251200,,527,3.7477477477477477
7132141,5,B00WGHUPAA,"I honestly had a hard time with the novel version of this series, but the adaptation is fantastically handled with exceptional acting.
The series deals with secrets and truth, people hiding their troubles and skeletons to keep up appearances no matter what.  It digs into humanity's desire to appear pleasant even though horrors exist behind their masks.  This is worth the watch, though it will hardly leave you feeling triumphant or hopeful in the end.  Life doesn't always end happily, and this series shows that trouble can continue even after the story ends.
WARNING!!!
This is a dark story with mature content.  The actor who played Dumbledore is in this though he does very un-Dumbledore like things.",1438905600,4,707,5.017094017094017
7132142,5,B00WGHUPAA,"Amazingly insightful and sadly true. A good look into how a community can work together for the ultimate good of all it's people or only the""clean"" ones. I still can't stop thinking about it.",1484438400,,191,4.647058823529412
7132143,3,B00WGHUPAA,Interesting story. Loads of build up but not a lot of pay off. I didn't personally care for the end. The acting was good. The characters were dynamic. The story was intriguing. I just felt like I was let down in the ending.,1484006400,,223,4.209302325581396

7132145,4,B00WGHUPAA,"Great adaptation of the book, great English drama!",1482537600,,50,5.375
7132146,1,B00WGHUPAA,"I am so disappointed with this ""adaptation"" that I'm not bothering with much of a review.  This was a very poor video which did not adequately represent the book.  Actually, it barely represents the book.  OK - the book wasn't all that great either, but this video was really, really bad.  J.K. - your disintegrating English village is okay, but please don't waste the effort with this storyline.  Your time is best spent with the Cormoran Strike vignettes.",1471651200,,457,4.8076923076923075
7132147,2,B00WGHUPAA,The book was much better.  Video was flat - voices hard to understand,1461283200,,69,4.3076923076923075
7132148,2,B00WGHUPAA,It is a good movie on it's own however it is hardly like the book. Prepare yourself and go into it with the mindset of it being an independent mini series and it will be much less disappointing.,1458432000,,194,4.131578947368421
7132149,5,B00WGHUPAA,"it tries to follow the book, but the end is not quite as heart wrenching but close",1448064000,,82,3.8823529411764706
7132150,1,B00WGHUPAA,"It would not play past 11 seconds.  I exchanged it and it was the same situation with the next disk.  I have high end modern (2 year old) equipment, and do not have this issue with any other disks.  Believe me, I tried several other movies I own to be sure and I ran the most recent update on my b-ray player to no avail.  Wound up putting the digital edition enclosed with the disk on vudu and running it through my roku 3 player to watch it.  Be sure you get a digital copy with the disk, I think there is a bad batch of disks floating around out there.  Probably be best go go with the DVD version to save on cost and to have better odds of it working.",1445385600,,655,3.9242424242424243
7132151,5,B00WGHUPAA,Excellent view into human behavior and group dynamic.  I enjoyed the movie as much as I enjoyed the book.,1443916800,2,105,4.526315789473684
8713324,1,B00WGHUPAA,"This series on it's own might be satisfying. Storyline okay acting great.
Oh but so much is missing if you take the time to read the whole story. It is a bit of a slow read to begin and keeping the characters straight is work but worth the effort.
The series needed to be longer in order to fill out the multiple storylines and do justice to this complex ""simple"" village of Pagford.
The characters have so much more depth. Behind this idyllic setting there is comedic and tragic and truthful tales everyone will recognize.
Too bad this adaptation missed the mark. Probably would have given more stars if did not read book.
Just an aside very much like the C.B.Strike series. Please get it in US/Canada zone dvd.",1531094400,,712,4.5271317829457365
8713325,1,B00WGHUPAA,"I loved the book, but hated the adaptation. The DVD eliminated characters, subplots, characters' motivations, and ""difficult"" topics.  New events and motivations were created for the remaining cast in order to link up the mutilated plot.  Characters in the book were a rich mix of saint & sinner, real social issues were debated heatedly, people and situations could become better or worse. The adaptation slashed away options, leaving only good guys vs bad guys and gutting the ending. A cast of such fine actors deserved better material.",1526428800,,539,5.183908045977011
8713326,5,B00WGHUPAA,"I haven't finished the book yet (a bit slow-paced for my liking), but I decided to watch this series because I wanted to know how the story progresses. There is so much packed into three episodes, which is a good thing, in my opinion. The characters are well-rounded, and the story has a much faster pace than the book. Overall, a great mini-series.",1522108800,,349,4.555555555555555
8713327,5,B00WGHUPAA,I loved this!  But ... 3 episodes?  Really.  I'm bummed.,1518480000,,56,4.4
8713328,5,B00WGHUPAA,"This miniseries is a heart-wrenching portrayal of the truth beneath the politics of the welfare state. People are poor and needy for as many (and more) reasons as people are wealthy; but we're all still human, we have the same drives, the same hopes. This series shows what happens when those hopes are dashed by people who treat the poor like livestock to be managed and not like human beings to be protected.

Michael Gambon and Julia McKenzie act, as always, wonderfully as a couple who have committed themselves to the same sort of banal evil and self-interest that wrecks so many families. Abigail Lawrie delivers a stand-out performance that drives depth in her character that wasn't present in the script. What really made the show for me, though, was Monica Dolan's performance. Her character's innate goodness and the depth of emotion she invested reminded me of my own mother, a strong woman whose desire to do good is so often thwarted by the apathy and stupidity of others.

Watch it and try to understand: it could be you that society decides to cast aside.",1504483200,2,1070,4.778378378378378
8713329,5,B00WGHUPAA,Very interesting storyline.,1501459200,,27,8.333333333333334
8713330,3,B00WGHUPAA,"After I finished reading the book, I soooo wanted to watch the tv series! but I was disappointed! wasn't like the book at allll!",1491868800,,128,4.375
8713331,2,B00WGHUPAA,It was upsetting to me that the show deviated so much from the plot of the novel. The ending not being true to the original storyline also greatly disappointed me and cheapened the experience of watching the story unfold. It lessened the gravity of the situations depicted - what I loved about the book was that it was real and dark just like the reality many people live in. The show tried to put a happier spin on it and I think that degraded the purpose of the original book.,1486166400,2,478,4.322222222222222
8713332,2,B00WGHUPAA,"One of the most sordid, hopeless, dreary books I've ever finished.",1485388800,,66,5.090909090909091
8713333,3,B00WGHUPAA,"If I had only seen this show, I probably would have rated it higher cause it was well done and well casted. However, I read (listened to) the JK Rowling book about a year ago and I felt they left out too many characters and story lines from a book I really enjoyed. I understand that to fit into the miniseries format they would have to cut some stuff out, but I think they chopped a little too much from the source material. If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy this program. If you have, you might be disappointed. And a note to whoever is creating the Cormoran Strike shows--please don't do the same thing to them. I loved the series and hope when the shows come out the books are more or less intact.",1485129600,2,712,4.204379562043796
