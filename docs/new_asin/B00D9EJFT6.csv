5784563,3,B00D9EJFT6,"Having chosen this movie based on seeing Jonathan Bennet in ""Dogwalker's Christmas Tales"" whose sincerity, lovingness and good looks would be a welcome addition to any plot, I was disappointed by the unrealistic holes in the script.  The basic story
(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) is that the wife in this young military family is being deployed in Japan because she speaks Japanese to help after the nuclear disaster and earthquake, leaving behind her husband and 10 year old son.  The first uncomfortable hole was when the little boy was filming her and dad as keepsake until her return.  The son has asked what she loves about her hubby, and, missing an opportunity for a meaningful and compassionate answer as to why people love each other and want to be partners, a frivolous answer about helping with laundry is floated.  Kids can feel in their gut when parents avoid important issues,and are not telling the truth.  Number Two Empty Moment was, when she's been gone a short while, bureaucrats from Child Protective Services show up saying that there is no paperwork proving hubby or anyone else is the little boy's father, a gut wrenching surprise, indeed, as the child is rendered helpless and unaided, even though the person he thought was dad has been there ever since he can remember.  The dad admits meeting mommy when child was still an infant, and marrying her, but failing to go through the formal adoption.  Here, due to subsequent events, ti would have been supportive and realistic to see early life
flashbacks with the three of them both doing a little soldier training possibly, but certainly showing son banging away very musically on his piano when about 3 years old, which is about the earliest when prodigy talent shows up, plus maybe a scene or
two of getting a teacher for some lessons, in order to support the thesis of the story.  But, alas, no.  Nathan, the little boy, overhears daddy's dilemma with CPS, and without one scene of grief or indecision over losing a loving father, stalwartly packs his portable piano, setting off on foot, dressed in military togs to run away, though he knows not where.  His lack of feeling is numbing.  Luckily, he meets a former soldier, also dressed in fatigues, whom we learn is suffering from PTSD, who helps him by
setting up a"" meeting"" with a rich divorcee and daughter who do eventually take care of him and try to help him by putting him in a local orphanage until his parents can be located.  Scattered are somewhat confusing scenes of him playing his plastic portable piano alternately playing the benefactors' grand piano, sometimes poorly, sometimes brilliantly, without any insight into the inconsistency available for the viewer.  A prodigy doesn't just suddenly become extremely competent without any support, which is the premise the filmmakers seem to be presenting,for, the plot thickens when the orphanage is under threat, the other kids hear
him playing, again poorly, with alternating brilliance, and demand he play at a benefit to save the orphanage.  This is a good development of story, but his lack of experience performing for others (wouldn't mommy and daddy have staged little concerts, if indeed he was so talented?) is a setback which is sluffed off with complements  on his impromptu concert for the kids, resulting in his sudden elevation to star status with orchestra and chorus, and spiffy suit and shiny shoes on performance night.

Meanwhile, daddy is rendered worried and helpless, and  mommy has been reported MIA, while crossing a bridge (whether on foot or in a tank is not revealed) which collapsed , dumping her squadron 100 feet down into the river below.

As no news of her survival or death continues, this is the only time Nathan seems slightly out of balance.  When dad, still worried and helpless, and he are reunited, Nathan says he has lost his psychological/spiritual connection with mom; he can't feel her presence any longer, which takes away his incentive for the concert.  This is another lost moment .  Since military families are often separated (and reunited,too) , some flashbacks to daddy being gone, and mommy soothing son, or mommy being gone and daddy soothing son would have been not only natural and explanatory of the life style, but supportive for this critical moment.  Instead,  Nathan is just left hanging, his hope thin.

So, without spoiling the denouement, there were just too many unsupported steps in this really good story. ( The credits showed
the little star actually wrote some of the music - pretty  cool. Thus the acting seemed improbable and ungrounded by the direction or script, which was just too dissatisfying for me.",1509408000,,4656,4.930857874519846

This little boy's mom goes to Japan to help with a earth quake and titlewave and goes MIA. While they are looking for her he finds out his dad is not his birth father and as paperwork hasn't been filled out the government comes to take the boy. So the boy runs away. It seems no matter where the boy goes he touches lives and draws out the best in others. His music is only the smallest part of this and when he decides to be found he is sent to an orphanage  on the verge of closer. So the kids plan a concert starring the runaway boy without telling anyone.

The story is terrible and plays on every possible tragedy (deployment, loss of a parent, paternity, foster care, homelessness, etc).  It all gets neatly tied up at the end, too neatly.  The only saving grace is watching and listening to Ethan play.  Plan to fast forward to those parts.

Unrealistic and disturbing that the child's custody was being taken away from the father that raised him and the only father he knew.  That might send a wrong message specially since his mother was MIA on a military mission and the mother had left custody of her child with her husband.  Being from a military family and being raised during the Vietnam War were my father served 2 terms no one really knows the stress and anxiety these children go through knowing that our father could be killed any day.

I loved what the little girl said, ""Anyone can be a Father, but not everyone could be a Dad.""  Life can change in an instant.  Always tell the people you love how much you love them because at the end of the day they could not be there, God could want them back.  God worked a miracle in the life of this little boy.

5785432,5,B00D9EJFT6,"This is a great family movie but one that adults can learn a lot from the children.  While not specifically a Christian film, scriptural principles are the basis of this movie.  Jesus said to His disciples that we needed to become like children in order to enter the kingdom of heaven.  Why?  Children have not yet been tainted by the world and instinctively believe that anything is possible.  This young man is remarkable and his willingness to move beyond his fears to help others, even while he is in the midst of his own pain and situation, will bring you to tears!  There is specifically one scene in the movie where the innocence of a child is so clearly demonstrated when the young man is hiding in the basement and asks where he can sleep.  You need to be alert to not miss it, but I  found it to be priceless.  This is a movie that I'll be adding to my movie collection.",1392422400,4,880,4.3496932515337425

I couldn't hold back the tears it was really touching. I am proud of all the cast, IGC and for Pastor Marvin Miles for having the vision to let God move thru him to produce this movie.

The piano prodigy has a great voice and he plays beautifully but his acting was very awkward and all the dialogue was amateurish. I also didn't like that a piano prodigy goes from barely knowing the notes to playing amazingly concert-style with original music in about a week. 3 Stars for effort but it really missed the mark for me.
I do have to say that Captain Miles was my favorite and the best actor in this film.",1530748800,,532,4.383838383838384

8590950,3,B00D9EJFT6,"Ethan Bortnick (Nathan) is a delight...no, really. And in real life, he is a prodigious young entertainer. I won't spoil it all by recalling all of the ""child prodigies"" who were exploited beyond their emotional and intellectual ability to handle all the nonsense of showbiz, but if this is what he wants to do, God help him! The movie is way too saccharine for my sensibilities, but the kids in your family, will love it. I love Jonathan Bennett, he's hot and gives a very sincere performance here along with another favorite, Lacey Chabert (she fully gets the child star biz of show biz). The script is pure cornball, adult members of the cast are stiff as cardboard and the kids (in angel mode), are...well, kids. Deetroit shines and the diversity of the cast as well as shoutouts to troops (those serving abroad and those suffering at home), are duly noted, if a bit overwrought. The closing scenes--the concert with Bortnick in full glory, got me. This was not the diversion I wanted, but guess I needed a little boost.",1524528000,,1024,4.694444444444445

There are some talented actors in it but the dialogue doesn't give much room for their talents. In many places, it is just unrealistic. The talent of the young boy is quite impressive though. The film will pull at your heartstrings. I found myself crying at the end but I wasn't really invested in the movie. It was just too corny and contrived.",1522713600,,459,4.411764705882353
