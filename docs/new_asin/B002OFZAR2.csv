8376001,1,B002OFZAR2,"This film is actually Heavenly Desire.
Lust Vegas Joyride runs approx. 75 minutes.
Heavenly Desire runs 85 minutes.
All of the sex scenes are included yet the segment where
Seka and Serena die and make a deal with the Devil
aka: Johnnie Keyes has been edited out.
This segment takes place between scenes 1 and 2.
The opening credits read
Limelight Releasing Presents Lust Vegas Joyride.
So if you already have Heavenly Desire there is no need to purchase
this film other than different box art and opening credits.

My 1 star rating is based upon the fact that this film is edited
and that the pictures on the front and back of the box are from
scenes that are not included in this film, very misleading,
as the adult film industry is known for.

Below are the scenes in order of appearance;

Scene 1  Seka, Johnny Hardin
Scene 2  Seka, Jon Martin
Scene 3  Dani Williams, Eileen Wells, Serena
Scene 4  Aubrey Nichols, Debi Gunter, Johnny Hardin
Scene 5  Aubrey Nichols, Liza Dwyer, Jamie Gillis
Scene 6  Serena, Johnnie Keyes
Scene 7  Dani Williams, Mike Ranger
Scene 8  Stacy Goldman, Unknown Female, Unknown Male
Scene 9  Hillary Summers, Jon Martin
Scene 10  Dani Williams, Debi Gunter, Hillary Summers, Liza Dwyer
Scene 11  Aubrey Nichols, Dani Williams, Debi Gunter,
  Hillary Summers, Eileen Wells, Serena, Liza Dwyer,
  Johnny Hardin, Jamie Gillis, Jon Martin,
  Johnnie Keyes, Mike Ranger
Scene 12  Seka, Mike Ranger",1344038400,,1424,4.825726141078838
