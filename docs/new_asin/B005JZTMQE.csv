8476319,5,B005JZTMQE,"I bought this set thinking it was more episodes from season 2.  But all these shows are on the 2nd season 4 disc set. I'm guessing that out there somewhere is another 2 disc set that contains the other 2 discs of the 2nd season. Now they are issueing them by volumn. I wish they would issue this show by seasons. It would be so much easier to keep track.

Update: I found the other two discs on a set called Rare Gems. If you already have the 4 disc season 2 DVDs stay away from these two sets.

The 5 stars are for the show not History Channel's dis-jointed method of presentment on DVD.",1338422400,8,588,4.095652173913043
