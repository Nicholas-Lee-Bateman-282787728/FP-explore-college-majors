8561218,2,B00B2203PM,I have always liked Kevin Sorbo but there is not much of him in this slow paced boring movie.  He isn't in it much and that hurts the plot a lot.  Not much action and the drama is just ok.  Barely could sit thru it.  Do not bother with this one--check out westerns that  Sorbo is in and does his best!!,1387238400,2,302,3.8852459016393444
8561219,3,B00B2203PM,"Shadow Witness ventures into the world of the paranormal,but actually fizzles a bit. In the premise,a detective finds himself the prime suspect in the murders of his wife and a young girl,which occurred a few years apart. The problem is,he was critically injured in the incident which killed his wife and died later. His spirit meets that of the young girl and they team up to clear his name. Kevin Sorbo plays the straight-laced police captain investigating the two cases. For me,it took a while for the pieces to come together and made sense. The bonus featurette is a tour of the hospital where the film was shot and is narrated by Ethan Phillips,who plays the medical examiner. If you are a Sorbo fan,as I am,you may want to give this one a look,but otherwise give it a pass.",1368230400,4,779,4.611510791366906
