6479879,5,B00LD5KSY4,This is a great instructional Tai Chi video. I utilize the breathing techniques after lunch before entering the stressful world that is acute care medicine. The quick breathing exercises are easily implemented into everyday life. The Tai Chi follow along classes can be done after a long day of working. I have recommended this DVD to peers to reduce stress in their everyday life.,1406764800,18,381,4.96875

6479882,1,B00LD5KSY4,"I should have listened to another review. It's really boring to do these exercises without a music background. How hard would it have been to add that to the DVD. He doesn't talk, so it wouldn't drown him out!!! You have to watch the video all the time or you won't know what's going on.",1439078400,8,287,4.236363636363636

6479888,3,B00LD5KSY4,"Good instruction, but the instructor didn't seem all that enthused.  I would have liked music with a more pleasant background setting.  It appeared that the setting was a paneled basement room.  Not  what I was hoping for.",1412726400,,222,4.918918918918919
6479889,5,B00LD5KSY4,"My brother told me about Tai Chi, since it had been helping him relax and do low impact exercises while recovering from an injury. He finally convinced me to just give it a try. I started with the level 1 breathing exercises. They are pretty simple, but really make my body feel more energized somehow and my mind clearer. I am a graduate student and teacher, so finding time to do anything is a challenge. I like that the classes are fairly short in length, and don't have any unnecessary instruction, or down time. I never really understood Tai Chi before, but this video was a nice introduction.",1409356800,27,598,4.546296296296297
6479890,5,B00LD5KSY4,"Master Hodge has produced another outstanding tai chi DVD. The breathing lessons are excellent. I feel this is a perfect supplement
to his other Complete Tai Chi course. I've been practicing his Complete Tai Chi for two months and I use this one 3x weekly. I've
used other Tai Chi DVDs but this is one of the best. Master Hodge really breaks down the techniques. I love the menus because I
can work on individual techniques when I don't have much time. Many tai chi dvds teach a form but don't show multiple angles and
they don't have warm-ups, Master Hodge has all of this in the dvd. It feels like a private lesson. I hope he makes more dvds in the
future so I can continue to practice his approach to tai chi.",1408492800,20,712,4.32089552238806

8665316,1,B00LD5KSY4,"I've written a critique on this and emailed it to you already. Here's a synopsis of what I said. This is one of the worst tai chi duds I've had the
displeasure of watching. It's bungled by excessive speed and fast-talk by the ""host,"" full of a gaggle of not-so-familiar tai chi terms, all posed against a Wal-Mart inspired-wall whose main theme is cheap panelling and exposed electrical outlets. Whatever happened to the great-out-of-doors?
I'm sorry I wasted my hard-earned money on this turkey.",1465603200,,496,4.916666666666667
