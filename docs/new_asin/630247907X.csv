Tim Mathinson is the perfect co-star as they not only look good together, their comedy talents shine off of each other.  These are two professional actors who truly know their craft. I have not laughed so much in years!  I read on line that Ann Jillian's real life husband has a small role of a ""tourist"" that while not a pro actor, he did a professional job as the ex-patient of Tim M. who almost gives Tim's ""doctor"" status away by a chance meeting on the Spanish Steps in Rome.  Great sight-seeing too of wonderful Rome, Italy  I loved this movie.",1328486400,,621,4.3652173913043475

7826245,4,630247907X,"Ann Jillian and Tim Matheson at their best. Ann plays the character Liz, a cop from Philly and Matheson a top doctor named Harry. Liz cashes in her savings of ten years to go on the holiday of a lifetime to Rome, whereas Harry visits this romantic city each year. They first meet each other on the plane and spend the flight sitting next to each other enjoying a Marx Brothers film. Each of them wants to be someone else, so Liz pretends she's a 'Chief' of a corporation because, in her experience, whenever she tells a man she's a cop, his interest dwindles. On the other hand, when Harry tells a woman he's a doctor they only want him for the glamour and his pay packet so he tells Liz he is a hospital porter who won the trip in a raffle. Little did they know on the flight to Italy they would meet again in Rome and spend a glorious week together and fall in love. Back in Philly they continue the romance but who is going to own up to telling 'Little White Lies'?
A great, feel good film that can be watched over and over again.",1030233600,4,1033,4.17
