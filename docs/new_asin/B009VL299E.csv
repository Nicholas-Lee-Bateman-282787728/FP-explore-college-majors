5369248,5,B009VL299E,"This concert is very well filmed and the music recording is very clear and all musicians can be heard on each song. I do not think that any musician dominates another, but blends his music in with everyone else in the band to form one tight rockin unit. The guitar playing and drumming are performed at a level of excellence that few other bands ever achieve. To me, no other metal band rocks as hard as Metallica does.",1464912000,3,419,4.384615384615385

5369250,5,B009VL299E,"Metallica obviously had a thing or two to prove when they made this movie.  To show the fans that they weren't soft, and to show the world that they are unquestionably the HARDEST BEST HARD ROCK- METAL BAND EVER!!!  WOW...what a performance.",1462752000,,241,4.714285714285714
5369251,5,B009VL299E,"As many fans know, there are 4 or 5 DVDs released of the Death Magnetic tour.  I am not sure exactly how many there are because I also have about 7 or 8 bootlegs from the Orion festival (televised) and other televised Metallica shows during the Magnetic tours.

However to me this is definitely one of my favorite store bought DVDs.  This is not the same old tried and true Metallica song lineup.  This is new challenging and proves Robert should have been stolen from Suicidal Tendencies in the 80's after Burton's death rather than bringing Jason into the band.

If you ever saw Metallica with Cliff Burton in the 80's, this DVD may make the hair rise on your arms in places.  There were times, Robert almost channeled Cliff in some performances.

That is one of the main reasons, this DVD is my pick for the best of the Metallica Magnetic tour series.",1458864000,,854,4.5064935064935066

5369258,4,B009VL299E,"I have been a Metallica fan since i was 5 years old as it was 1 of my mom's favorite bands & soon became 1 of my favorites.
I own all of their albums as well as all of their lige dvds & concerts,got to see them in concert 2 times when they toured St. Anger & also to tour for Death Magnetic.
When i saw this dvd was out i grabbed it for about 5$ including shipping,so how can you go wrong? You can't !
The concert is recorded with excellent audio and excellent camera angles in Quebec on Halloween night 2009
There set is damn near 2 hours long,the set is loaded with all songs that were chosen online by the fans themselves. The setlist contains 8 out of 10 of the songs from the Death Magnetic album as well as some very old & very classic stapkes in the catalogue of Metallica,spanning their career. 18 songs on disc 1 & 8 tracks as bonus on the 2nd dvd,which also includes band interviews.
The 2 sets have lots of classic heavy tracks from all albums except for the St. Anger album as well as Load & Reload,so you get heavy tracks from Kill Em All to the Black album as well as 80% of the Magnetic album(which i enjoyed)
The band is super tight,the bass is nice and audible as Robert Trujilio slams away & jumps around like a posessed man thumping that bass with his ringers & no pick,which adds depth.
The drums are top notch as well,the toms & snare aren't overly clanky like the St. Anger cd. Kirks playing is spot on as is James as they rip through the tracks with great thrashing.
The state & crowd are insane,the encore is great as they come out with masks & a ton of huge black balls fall from the ceiling.
Disc 2 has great tracks and great audio just like the initial concert.
The only complaint i have is that James voice seems a bit flat,but after nearly 40 years touring & playing the throat is sure to get weakened a bit. Regardless the show is killer,highlights of the show include classics like One,Battery,Master of Puppets as well as rare gems like Sanitarium,Shortest Straw,Whiplash,Breadfan,Four Horsemen & Turn the Page. Not to mention the 8 out of 10 songs from Death Magnetic which to me are the main selling point cuz they are all new tracks which have never been seen on any live dvds before. This is an album for fans & collectors of every age and generation as it is truly a great performance. Go get it !",1446076800,2,2334,4.259009009009009

The leader of that trash metal music are giving you all for your money, especially for the cheap price of that 3 hour show. And i am not the biggest fan of the band, so i imagine that Metallica and lovers of that kind of music have already purchase that one. There's some songs that i didn't know about on this show that didn't grab my attention as enjoyable, but the ""Black album songs"" are still very good after many years. 3.5 stars",1419552000,,612,4.3304347826086955

5369278,5,B009VL299E,"This bluray is awesome, just like any other metallica live release it's jam packed with songs, over 2 hours worth. Fans of Death Magnetic will find like 8 songs from that album here! It's hard to get any of the Death Magnetic live songs from any other live metallica release, one reason I'm so excited about this release. It's also jam packed with the usual metallica classics and a few covers. The editing is frantic, I wish it focused a bit on more close ups of the guitar fret work, they need to give you the option to chose your angle like some of the older DVDs. There are no songs from St Anger which is a shame. The concert is very intense, some songs are sped up, the energy is very raw. The picture quality is very sharp and clear. Love this bluray! I could watch it chunks at a time for weeks! I also wish this was released on cd",1413936000,,839,4.185185185185185

5369282,3,B009VL299E,Camara  angle switching every few seconds and makes this really hard to watch. Also they show just as many shots of the audience as they do the band. It felt like the director had tourrettes syndrome.  Thats why I rated this lower. Love the songs and sound quality but this is easier to listen to than watch.,1408492800,,308,4.385964912280702

5369296,5,B009VL299E,"Its difficult to properly rate a Metallica DVD.  The band has so many of them out there, with some more produced than others.  This is one show they waited a while to release, and it is very well done.  What I particularly liked was the sound quality.  It is very similar to the sound quality of their Nimes 2009 DVD.

With so many DVDs to their credit, many of the live songs become repetitive.  How many versions of Enter Sandman do you really need?  Its nice that this DVD set has songs like Damage Inc, Shortest Straw, and Killing Time, which don't appear too often on professional releases.  If you like Metallica, youll like this DVD.  Indeed, if you like a good musical performance to an energized and engaged audience, youll also like this.",1388361600,4,748,4.522388059701493
5369297,3,B009VL299E,"Metallica!  The heavy metal rock Gods! Sound was awesome as well as playlist. The camera angle changes were all over the place!  The angles seem to change to often in midstream of the songs. A three or four camera shot would suffice. Not what appeared to be eight or more.

5369299,4,B009VL299E,"Metallica holds a special place in my heart.  They were my first favorite metal band.  Being a child of the 80's, I found that AJFA and MOP were the definitive albums to own.  Watching this blu ray kinda makes me sad, because Lars is absolutely bringing down their live shows.  He is a terribly sloppy drummer, whose internal metronome needs to be tweaked.  Even Kirks solos have gotten to be quite meh over the years.  James and Robert kick ass, nuff said.  The audio is decent enough on this, but I expected more.  The newest Dream Theater Blu ray is how a live concert should sound.",1385078400,,585,4.452830188679245

5369305,5,B009VL299E,"Having seen them in concerts in person I felt like this Blu Ray concert really captured the essence of a a great Metallica show.  They really are the best live band out there in my humble opinion.  You may disagree, but for me Metallica sets the bar, and this Blu Ray helps to illustrate why.  An excellent live performance with a great set list with attitude and a little bit of theatricality goes a long way.  The HD looks really good here and the sounds is crystal.  If your a fan, or if you are just someone looking for a great concert Blu Ray pick this one up!",1376438400,,565,4.194444444444445
5369306,4,B009VL299E,The only thing I don't like about this one is the venue is pretty dark..would like to see the guys jamming in a little more light,1375747200,,129,4.0
5369307,4,B009VL299E,"First off let me explain. I have a REAL home theater, not a little cheap ""home theater in in box"", or a sound bar! I have a Sony ES receiver(7.1) and Definitive Technology(7002's up front, 2002 center, BPX 1.2's on the side, and Pro Monitor 1000's in the rear) all the way around... with a PS3 and a LG 8600 series TV.

I think the video is just fine, but the sound lacks until you get to ""Sad But True"". It is muddy and the vocals are to high, it gets better, and then around ""Enter Sandman"" it gets better, and is right on for the last song which is ""Seek and Destroy!"" The ""bonus"" tracks sound better than the full concert although a little heavy on the bottom end.

Metallica is one of my favorite groups and the use Clair Brothers(who is big bucks) for their sound company on the road, wish they would of spent a few $$ more for the production of the DVD. All in all it is good!",1371859200,,883,4.098265895953757

5369309,5,B009VL299E,"Can't go wrong with this blu-ray at the price it sells for. Maybe I like their Mexico dvd better, but this comes in a close second(& well ahead of their S&M dvd). Editing as usual could be slower paced, but audio & video are excellent.(though James' vocals seemed a little weak in the mix at times)I haven't watched the bonus features yet, but the 2 hour concert alone makes this a no-brainer for all Metallica fans.",1369612800,,416,4.4868421052631575
5369310,4,B009VL299E,"As great visually and sonically as you can expect from Blu-Ray.  Just like being there, and I was.

Metallica are bigger than they have ever been, however, the long-time fans will still miss their best days when they were at their artistic peak.  This was between 20 and 25 years ago.",1368835200,2,284,4.529411764705882
5369311,2,B009VL299E,"This Blu has excellent picture and audio quality. Something you would expect from a blu. The performance and the editing, however, are no good. Metallica's low effort sped up performance was most annoying and influenced my rating greatly. All the songs are sped up, chopped up and performed without emotion; like they were just performing the song to rush them out of queue for the next. I get the up-tempo approach and some songs condensing because Metallica has such a large library and their fans want all their favorite songs but still make it worth listening to right? I prefer fewer songs with higher quality. Less is more. Also, Hetfield's vocals sounded lazy. He was almost talking through most the lyrics and often he dropped his octaves with (spoken) clean vocals. Metal attitude was non-existent, he was happy, cocky and casual. Unfortunately his performance matched. That is not the Metallica I remember, however, because they were about attitude. They were not your friends. So much for performance.

Not quite as influential to my negative rating, but still important, was the video edits. What's up with all the super extreme close-ups and the millisecond cuts? I guess they were trying to make up for the uninspired performances with visual faced paced edits. When I see concerts I want to see performances. Focus on the dominant musician and show me their skills. I want to see Kirk's solos, I want to see James shred, and show me Lars's drum-kit! Does Danny have chops? Video or it didn't happen. I don't know if it happened because I only saw their faces.",1367884800,2,1574,4.873134328358209

5369314,2,B009VL299E,"Metalica has performed live all their career and this is a very pollished performance from a seasoned band. The linup is a good mix of old classics and new songs. James is great as always. The drawback here, and the reason for 2stars, is that Lars acts like Gollum on the drums, sticking his tongue out the whole time and making faces. This is hard to watch and annoying. This is a made-for-DVD performance and it is well-lit and clean, rather boring, performance by a band known for great live performances.",1365724800,2,508,4.593406593406593

I went to see this tour in San Juan,PR and I was just waiting for them to release a blu ray to remember that awesome night. This blu ray concert is almost exactly the concert that a saw. I said almost because the fans here are not as excited as the concert that I went and some special effects does not appear here. With that said this blu ray is good but I was hoping something better about the visuals. The camera is moving a lot and you can't appreciate the concert much. The part of the lasers I think was not filmed well. Like I said, I went to this concert and the view was much better that what appears here. Is not the first time that I see this problem, in concerts from others musicians like U2 you see this jumping around and I hated it.

ONLY to find out that the disc was defective. It could not be read. I sent it back for a replacement, and (yet again) amazon send me another bad disc. I'll be honest, it played well at first, but then the same message pop up. I know what your thinking. I updated the firmware, I got a lens cleaner, I even took it to get it buffed. When I showed it to the guy he said ""Uhhh...there aren't any scratches on the disc.""
I've only had the blu-ray player for about a year and it plays other blu-ray discs with no problem so I know it's not that.
And as much as I wanted a replacement (AGAIN) they were ""out of stock"" at the moment so I couldn't. So Im stuck with a disc hoping that it will play through the whole show someday. Seems like a distant dream, a dream that Amazon.com crushed",1365552000,,903,4.044692737430168

5369325,2,B009VL299E,"This is not about the music or the choice of songs.

What I find annoying about this DVD is the way it is captured.

The director thinks he has to change angle every two seconds just to prove how dynamic the show is.
Same with the shots from the crowd all through the show. I think I saw half of the audience in irrelevant close-ups all through the DVD.

Stick to te show and eventually throw in some crowd shots in between songs !!

While in Canada Metallica had better contacted Pierre an Franois Lamoureux to register the show.
Their registration of Tragically Hip ( That Night In Toronto) or Joe Satriani( Satchurated) show how it has to be done !!",1360972800,23,652,4.363636363636363

5369346,5,B009VL299E,"Got it about a month ago and what can I say its fricken awesome!!! This is the exact same tour I saw them on back in 2009 In D.C apart of their Death Magnetic tour. Entirely the same setlist and the same intensity I witnessed when I saw them 4 yrs ago. I love this band they are my favorite I would kill to see them again they are without a doubt the greatest metal band that ever existed. If you are a big Metallica fan you know you gotta check this dvd out or hell even buy its def worth $13 bucks or $15 whichever it is I mean thats cheap for a two disc set that spans over 20 live tracks some new (Death Magnetic) and some older Metallica classics my only complaint is I wish Metallica would play some more of their older songs you never hear much like Orion, Escape, The Call of Ktulu, The thing that should not be, Leper Messiah, Metal Militia, Jump in the Fire, The God that failed, that would be great! But at least they threw Phantom Lord, and Whiplash in their that was a shocker alright. And too bad they didn't do anything from Load and Reload some of those songs would have been great to hear but I know all about the haters on those two albums and I won't even mention St. Anger which I loved btw. Bottom line this dvd is badass!! A great show that could be yours for a very low price I wouldnt hesitate on buying this easily better then their Three nights in Mexico, The Big Four, and Cunning stunts dvds. BUY THIS!!!!

You can hear the bass, and the rear speakers are used well when listening in surround sound. Really wish Death Magnetic the CD sounded this good.",1356998400,2,260,4.8
5369360,4,B009VL299E,"Metallica is my favorite band and they did a fantastic job during these shows but there is a major issue with this concert; the editing. You can literally sit there and count to 2 or sometimes 3 and the camera angle changes every 2-3 seconds on the nose. After watching the first 4 songs my eyes hurt. I hope this trend of choppy editing stops soon because it's annoying, distracting and head ache inducing.
At least this dvd is priced fairly and there is a great selection of songs. Most people say this about Enter Sandman but I'd rather hear almost any other song than Seek & Destroy for the thousandth time. Motorbreath, Wherever I May Roam, Leper Messiah, And Justice For All, anything but Seek & Destroy AGAIN.
I give Metallica 5 stars for their kick ass performance but the editing knocks my overall score down to 4 stars.",1356480000,5,829,4.533333333333333

the bad- you really couldn't see much because it was shot with very little light. so alot of it is in the dark.  and the editing was sooooo bad. it made it unwatchable. every 2 seconds the camera shot would change. and it just kept going on and on like that, ANNOYING.",1356307200,2,499,4.26595744680851

5369367,5,B009VL299E,"This tour has garnered quite a few live releases, and I have seem them all from Nimes, to Mexico to Sophia and on.  I do not detract stars based on set lists, I simply review the product itself, set list is really a matter of opinion.  Now down to the bolts:  Great picture, viewed on a LG LED 55 inch tv via PS3 and it was amazing, the 5.1 DTS-HD sound was fantastic.  I didn't really find the cam views a distraction, nor do I think it was frantic or manic.  I've seen frantic filming and I didn't feel this concert had that, there are switches but they aren't anything that detracted from my viewing personally.  AC/DC's River release had far faster changes and took some getting used to, but I still didn't feel it detracted from the experience, but again, this is really a personal preference, you'll have to watch to see if it's an issue for you (which you can view on MetallicaTV on youtube, full songs from this release)before purchasing.  The extra songs included were a great addition, all of these tracks were voted on by the fans and the inclusion of Shortest Straw is just something of a bear hug, one of my favorites.  I also thought their older stuff sounded great, not as slow and chugging as some of their previous performances, I thought they were fast and furious in this show.  I would recommend the show to anyone who loved Death Magnetic, these songs shine live.  I couldn't find any reason to subtract stars based on the product, the packaging and everything was fine, the price was quite reasonable.  Overall 5 stars.",1355875200,12,1541,4.5071942446043165
5369368,5,B009VL299E,"Metallica has been one of my favorite bands for many years... from Live S***, Cunning Stunts, S&M, Nimes, and Mexico City, I have a lot of their live DVDs. This one probably has the best audio/video quality and even some pretty cool packaging.

The main reason for my purchase: the set list. Yes, there are 10 songs that were already on the Nimes DVD... but there are 16 songs that were not. Even cuts from the Garage sessions! Basically, I saw ""Damage Inc."" on their website and went straight to the record store. ""The Shortest Straw"" was awesome, too.

I have no qualms with the band's performance, either. They've built a legendary reputation off their relentless touring. They've been going hard for a long, long time, so I'll accept the imperfections and be grateful that they keep giving us awesome new set lists on DVD!

The set list isn't bad but there is far to much death craptastic on it...I actually think they play the whole album.  I am not one of the Metallica fans who will buy everything and praise it becasue it has the word ""Metallica"" on it.  I praise them when they release quality music/live shows which hasen't been for 20+ years now and I speak my mind when they release garbage like Load, Re-load, Lulu, DM or St. S%*&.  This DVD is inferior to the mexico live dvd set and seems like a pointless cash grab release that is just a copy/paste of every live death craptastic concert.  I gave up a long time ago being excited for anything from this band.  Hopefully their next album will have the real Hetfild singing, no mind numbing kindergarden lyrics, good riffs, some improved drums and some actual inspiration/effort.",1355270400,4,987,4.51685393258427
5369372,4,B009VL299E,"This is my fourth, yes fourth, Metallica Blu-ray from this tour. I have the shows from Mexico, France, Big 4, and now this one. Hey, for a fraction of what I pay for a concert ticket, I get to own a Metallica show in stunning Blu-ray quality video and audio, and this is what you'll get with this disc. No disappointments here.  Video is stunning. Awesome black levels with minimal grain, evident only in shots using stationary cams of lesser quality. The laser show in the opening song gives evidence of the visual treat early on. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio is quite good also. Not the best I've heard, but overall well balanced and in-your-face.
With 8 out of the 10 songs from ""Death Magnetic"" on this one, it helps to like this CD, which I do. But the nicest surprise is the inclusion of the songs they don't play too often, such as Shortest Straw, Holier than Thou, Breadfan and Phantom Lord to name a few. I believe I enjoyed the Bonus Tracks and Footage portion more so than the full concert.

Unfortunately, the editing, like most recorded concerts these days, SUCKS! Way too frantic with unnecessary zoom-ins and zoom-outs, with most shots only lingering about a second if that. I realize that this type of ""ADD"" editing gives the impression that the show is just bursting with non-stop action, but with Metallica, we all know these guys are no slouches. Just give me shots where I can watch each of the guys doing what they do best for 5 or 6 seconds, similar to the time I'd spend focusing on them if I was at the show. I've never been at a Metallica show and directed my attention from James, to Kirk, to Lars, to Rob, to Lars then back to James -all in the span of 3 seconds!
Its too bad this filming/editing style is so prevalent these days. I know for some viewers it's a non-issue, but for me it knocks an otherwise 5-star rating down to AT BEST a 4. Sad, but true!",1355184000,73,1882,4.389684813753582
