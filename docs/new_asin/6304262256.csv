Es un video que no debe faltar en la videoteca de  los amantes de la buena musica y los buenos musicos. Es una gran pena que  no podamos escuchar en estos dias la musica de estos muchachos...  Shannon,  en paz descanse...

This video beutifuly ecapsulates the entire music carear of Blind Melon.  It contains videos and great  dialogs and interview clips.  Tons of In Concert stuff too.

817563,5,6304262256,"I had this video on VHS some years ago and lost it. I got the DVD and love it. I'm a huge Blind Melon fan and unfortunately there isn't a lot of of interview footage because they didn't do much. However, ""Letters from a Porcupine"" features all their full length videos in addition to Super 8 footage taken by the band and some impromptu and formal interviews. If you're a true Blind Melon fan, this is the best you can do.",1315094400,,422,4.222222222222222
817564,5,6304262256,"I heard this was a great Music Video...and I heard right. I ordered this from Amazon.com and received it fast and in perfect condition. It has a great documentary of the band, plus it has many Blind Melon music videos. Definately a must buy for Blind Melon fans.

817566,3,6304262256,"If you're expecting to get well informed of Blind Melon then this is not for you. After watching Letters from a Porcupine I have clear images of how the musicians looked when the band started, and then how they started to change throw their career. However I was expecting for a documentary and this is everything but it...

Even though you can enjoy a lot of songs, and great performances in Woodstock and in acoustic shows and beautiful concerts, the information regarding the history of the band, and the interviews are very dissordered, meaningless and incomplete.

I was very dissapointed as I was looking for recent impressions of the band members, more than watching the videoclips or enjoying the live cuts and the curious ""behind cameras"" stuff.",1291593600,2,754,4.929133858267717
817567,5,6304262256,"This dvd holds a special place in my heart.  Shannon Hoon gave us all he had during his short stay.  Show him some love and get yourself a copy of this.  Also, Blind Melon's 'Live at the Metro' dvd captures an incredible performance.  You won't be disappointed with either one.",1290470400,,277,4.48

817570,5,6304262256,"I have sort of forgotten of Blind Melon after leaving college in '95, but a couple years ago have been reunited with their music by a good friend....and then recently, another. Needless to say, I've come to love them all over again, and this DVD is constantly playing! It really shows what an amazing, and often overlooked band they were. So much talent and great music....I will definitely buy their new CD being released in mid-April (22nd, I believe), as the new lead  Travis Warren, in my opinion, has proven himself worthy! (check out performances on YouTube) Of course, no one can truly replace Shannon Hoon, RIP xoxo. Much love.",1206489600,,635,4.7727272727272725
817571,5,6304262256,"Yeah, really, if your a Blind Melon fan you need to own this DVD.  All of Blind Melon's videos are here (there were alot more than I remember ever having seen) as well as a great documentary about the band.  True Blind Melon fans should have this in thier collection.  I thought I was a real fan before owning this, I was wrong.  This is a deeply personal video about the band and what they went through with Hoon's addiction, and ultimatly, his death.",1196726400,,452,4.345238095238095
817572,5,6304262256,"This is an excellent documentary about Blind Melon and the battles that Shannon Hoon faced throughout the history of the band.  It is funny, exciting, and sad allowing the viewer to run the gauntlet of emotions.  I highly recommend it for any fan of the band and their music.",1191974400,,275,4.591836734693878

817644,5,6304262256,"As a fan of Blind Melon from day one, and also having a connection to Brad Smith, this CD is well worth the price of admission.

817646,5,6304262256,"Great DVD from a would be legendary band.  If you are unfamiliar with them, buy anything with their name on it, you will not regret it.  I don't care for too much music nowadays, but I have not stop listening to this great band for 14 years.  I doubt a month has passed in those 14 years that I have not listened to one of their albums.",1134000000,2,336,3.985074626865672
817647,4,6304262256,"I am a huge fan of Bands that let us see behind the scenes of making their music.

MTV videos are fine, but what I want is the real people doing what they love, not some made up show, which is what most music videos turn out like.

I really like this DVD mainly because it did exactly what I hoped it would, gave me a look at the muscians making their music in an intimate way. The video from shows and making the album are super great, and I understand Blind Melon a little more now due to this DVD.",1126224000,3,500,3.9405940594059405
817648,5,6304262256,"I had a lend of this DVD from a friend and watched the whole thing about 5 times, then I made sure i could find it to buy it before I gave it back to him ha..Its a great DVD That focuses on everything and really comes through to show how much passion Shannon Hoon and the rest of Blind Melon had as songwriters and musicians and it just shows what great guys and true musicians they were and are..I would definatly recommend this to all real Blind Melon fans",1110758400,,458,4.1
817649,5,6304262256,This is an awesome dvd for any new or old melon fans. A must have and a true inner look of the band. It shows how great a person shannon was and how tragic his loss truly was. Also to a previous review the girl featured on Mouth full of cavities was not shannon's girlfriend it was a a fan of the bands who went to many shows saying she could sing. The band later let her sing and decided to put her on a track while they were recording. The story is told in the dvd.,1104969600,,467,3.8247422680412373
817650,5,6304262256,"This DVD is essential to all fans of the Band. There are about 6 or 7 songs from the soup tour that show how good this band really was. To see how much emotion shannon put into these songs moves you to see it. Also contains two songs From their Intimate & Interactive on Much Music(Lemonade,St. Andrews Falls). also  contains woodstock 94' songs as well as extensive footage from there first tour. An absolute must for not just Blind Melon Fans but anybody whom is a fan of rock documentary. As soon as I was done watching it I wanted to watch it again, seen it 6 times to date.",1100131200,5,578,4.254545454545455
817651,4,6304262256,"... to the CD ROM on the Nico Blue album. It's kinda like there was no new material (for obvious reasons), but VH1 and the NB CDROM covered most of the material. I am a big purveyor of the Blind Melon and have been for years, so don't get me wrong... I do love this DVD and think that it is a wonderful addition to your BM collection.",1073433600,,334,3.926470588235294
817733,5,6304262256,"This DVD is a special thing. I remember being in college while Blind Melon was happening. They were one of many great things going on in music at the time. I wish I had payed them more attention, which is made ovious to me buy this film. This band really had a special sound. Captured here brilliantly.",1052265600,5,302,4.315789473684211
817734,5,6304262256,Years after Blind Melon's front man's demise the band releases Letters a movie which captures Blind Melon not only at their best but also at their not so good. The band achieved showing Blind Melon fans who they were and who Shannon was. The viewer picks up on Shannons drug use during their live performances in which they perform Walk(soup) and cover Velvet Undergrounds After Hours. They also manage to show Shannons happiness and free-ness by showing Shannon naked numerous times. The Blind Melon boys are extremely talented with great personalities which were caputured by home video many times. Blind Melon fans will not be disappointed!!!,1034208000,,645,5.09433962264151
817735,5,6304262256,"Even though I fell in love with Blind Melon long ago, Letters rekindled the flame and made me remember just exactly how wonderful their music is.  This is the finest tribute to Shannon.  This video is magnetic, and Shannon's beauty is hard to ignore.  I especially love that Letters highlights the music, the closely-knit love in the band and the magic of Shannon's presence and the glory of his life; not his addiction.  That's just a sad footnote.",1020816000,9,449,4.717948717948718
817736,5,6304262256,I just wish everyone got a chance to know this band...And EVERYONE should own a copy of it.  How cool is it when he has the bong in the table...hehehehe,1020470400,,152,4.066666666666666
817737,4,6304262256,"This is a very nice dvd but I get the feeling that it can only really be beneficial and enjoyable to a true fan, not someone with maybe only a slight interest. The quality of the video is pretty low; it aint film though, at times it looks like almost a high school production. The sound quality as well during some of the live performances leaves much to be desired...it sounds like the mix wasn't tweaked at all for home listening. Both of these quality issues really are easy to get past and the video progressively gets much much better. By the end it really has you pretty captivated.
The Woodstock footage is most definitely classic, and mouthful of cavities, although it is just the studio version, is phenomenal.
Major con is the lack of chapters in the documentary. Come On! Its like fast-forwarding a *shudder* VHS!",1012435200,2,824,4.612244897959184
817738,5,6304262256,"Remember how sick of the bee girl you were and ""No Rain"" just playing and playing and playing over again on the radio? I remember... I also remember when I got over that and really gave Blind Melon a chance. They are by far one of the most underrated bands to ever have a hit song. Behind the Music, along with the rest of the world, only remembers and depicts Shannon Hoon's tragic flaws and images of that darned bee girl. This DVD (or the video version even) will give you a perspective of what the whole band was about, and not strictly with respect to ""No Rain"". Buy this and get an understanding that may change your musical perspective forever...",1000684800,11,653,4.404958677685951

817740,5,6304262256,"I've owned the vhs version of letters from a porcupine for over 4 years now and i'm surprised i haven't worn it out already. Rest in Peace Shannon Hoon.  Whether you like Blind Melon or not Shannon has one of the greatest voices and the band is one of the most musically talented bands ever and it shows on this video.  It starts off with 2x4 and Galaxia in the Metro in Chicago.  However the best performances are Change on the David Letterman Show and Mouthful of Cavities with his girlfriend in their studio in New Orleans.  Buy this, you'll love it.",998524800,20,553,4.392156862745098
817741,5,6304262256,"This video has great footage of various performances by Blind Melon.  Among these are the band at The Metro in Chicago in September, 1995, shortly before Shannon's death.  Also featured is Shannon Hoon dressed in all white performing at Woodstock in 1994.  From that same year the band is featured on Saturday Night Live and David Letterman.
There are also various outtakes from the making of the ""No Rain"" video.  The band is shown working on the ""Soup"" album in their classic home/studio in New Orleans.  This video also features clips from MTV News with Kurt Loder commenting on the band and Shannon's legal problems.",982454400,10,620,4.866666666666666

7865869,5,6304262256,"Blind Melon was a band that was way ahead of their time! Anyone who is sick of the new bands coming out today, this is a must have for those who want to listen to something good as well as a familiar point in time. They were robbed of so much potential when Shannon Hoon had overdosed in 1995 but their music was so unique that their fans will always be fans and their music will always be remembered!",1380844800,3,401,4.0886075949367084
7865870,5,6304262256,"If you're a Blind Melon fan, you must get this! It gives you more than just the original VHS tape.
