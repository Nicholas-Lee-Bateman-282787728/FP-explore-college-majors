5048938,3,B0071PT9WM,"This movie was enjoyable and somehow I missed this one back in 1986 when it aired on television.  I noticed Urkel (Jaleel White) from Family Matters, as one of the orphans in the movie. This film marked John Denver's return to acting since Oh, God! and he went to make a few more movies afterwards.  John not only was a gifted singer, songwriter and guitarist but a gifted actor and sold you on the characters he played in his movies.",1448150400,2,434,4.4125

5048955,3,B0071PT9WM,"it might have been really good when the movie first came out, but now, today it seems kind of dated, dorky.. just ok.  And it has Shirley ( Laverne & Shirley tv show ) in it.. just an ok dorky movie..  John Denver is good, he is himself, John Denver, but the whole movie could have been a bit better.",1426723200,,300,3.9833333333333334

5048960,5,B0071PT9WM,"If you love John Denver, you will love this movie. I am especially touched that the ""love interest,"" isn't some skinny hottie. There is much silliness in the movie, but several poignant scenes.",1420761600,,193,4.878787878787879
5048961,5,B0071PT9WM,Love this movie - so old school with a great all star 80's cast.  I'm surprised it ever made it to DVD - I'm pretty sure my sister and I are the only ones who ever watched it and we watched it ALL the time,1420156800,,205,3.5555555555555554

5048977,5,B0071PT9WM,My all time favorite childhood movie! I searched for this movie for YEARS to no avail but i never stopped searching! I thought it might be cheesy to watch it as an adult but it was just as good ( if not better) than when I saw it as a child!,1411257600,,241,3.7450980392156863
5048978,5,B0071PT9WM,"Very quaint story for the whole family.  I am a huge John Denver fan, and he does a great job in this movie.  I recommend this for wholesome move for the entire family. It's about what really matters in life.",1399075200,,208,4.175
5048979,5,B0071PT9WM,I thought it was awesome.  It brought so many memories from the time when it was on back in the '80s.,1394409600,,101,3.8095238095238093

5048983,5,B0071PT9WM,"It was a childhood favorite, and I still enjoy it to this day!  A foster home for children becomes a family that fights to stay together using sneaky and silly methods.  May seem outdated compared to todays antics, but a classic. :)",1383609600,,232,4.5
5048984,5,B0071PT9WM,"This is a typically Disney family sitcom/drama, so is fairly fluffy and predictable, but John Denver does a very nice job as the surrogate dad to a bunch of misfit kids, and is thoroughly loveable.",1383091200,2,197,4.6571428571428575
5048985,5,B0071PT9WM,"John Denver, children, and animals: how could you possibly lose? Great movie for the entire family (a rare treasure). Loved this movie. I didn't even know it existed until I typed 'John Denver' into the Amazon search bar. I have since recommended it to several other people (a few of whom have already purchased it since.)

5048987,4,B0071PT9WM,This was a cute movie. Cindy Marshall and John Denver complimented each other rather well. The kids were funny and it's amazing to see Steve Urkel as an itty bitty boy! My kids enjoyed watching it as well.,1376006400,,205,4.421052631578948
5048988,3,B0071PT9WM,"I enjoy anything John Denver does but this movie was so predictable and herky jerky. I think John's later work in ""Oh God"" was much better. Still a good movie for your kids to watch.",1375833600,,182,4.228571428571429
5048989,5,B0071PT9WM,"As a John Denver fan, I had not heard of this movie before and it peaked my interest.  It's been nice to see and hear this beloved singer once again, he left us way too soon.
