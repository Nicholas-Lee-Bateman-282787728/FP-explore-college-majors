7981013,3,B00008AOS1,"The best was the Battle of Chief Pontiac which I saw as a kid in the theater and Sitting Bull.  Cry Blood, Apache we just, well how should I put this...should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Over all the set was entertaining.",1270425600,,236,4.222222222222222
7981014,2,B00008AOS1,"The third movie in this epic (Battle of Chief Pontiac) does not play. May I please exchange it for a fully functional copy?  Otherwise, my husband loved it.  Great for the grandkids to watch, too.",1169078400,,196,4.571428571428571
7981015,4,B00008AOS1,"the transfers of these movies are nice and that helps,but to call these movies classic is a big leap. still some good cowboy and indian movies!",1150243200,5,143,4.538461538461538
7981016,4,B00008AOS1,"Of the three movies, Sitting Bull (starring Iron Eyes Cody) and Battles of Chief Pontiac (Movie is in Black & White but is appropriate for the setting and date,stars Lon Chaney, Jr. and Lex Barker)are the best.  Even tho Cry Blood, Apache is a poor third, the set is well worth the money.  The injustices done to the American Indian is clearly and, I think, fairly presented.",1070236800,17,375,4.582089552238806
