1993089,5,B0001DYG1U,"This story has been a favorite of mine since I first saw the movie on TV in the 50's.  I've since researched this event and am pleased to say that the movie is extremely accurate with few exceptions for dramatic license.  The attack and destruction of two of the great dams of the industrial Ruhr Valley in Germany during World War Two is beautifully filmed, even in black & white.  The special effects during the attack are hair-raising, even by today's standards.  The details of how the special bombs used, and the technique to use them were developed move the story along nicely culminating with the intense attacks and the bitterswet aftermath- aircrew and bomber losses were over 40%.  The musical score compliments the action very well and the ""Dam Buster March"" is a tune that can be whisteled all day long.  This movie is a stirring tribute to Wing Commander Guy Gibson who led the raid, his courageous squadron, and Barnes Wallace, the genius who developed the bombs.  For sheer daring, courage, and determination, this movie ranks tops along with ""The Great Escape"" and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"".  A note to those who have seen the TV version- the video is unedited from the original and Guy Gibson's dog's name was NOT Trigger.",1088467200,19,1241,4.766355140186916
1993090,5,B0001DYG1U,"THE DAM BUSTERS [1954 / 2015] [55th Special Anniversary Edition] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] They Fly Where No One Ever Flew Before! The Dam Busters: Hits Its Targets!

A much-loved British film classic, Michael Anderson's 1954 drama captures the tension and bravery of an audacious raid on the centre of Nazi Germany's industrial complex, and the quintessentially English combination of inventiveness and dogged determination. For the first time on screen! The whole amazing story of the incredible bombs that had to bounce and the top-secret squadron that flew on an impossible course to hurl them against Europes toughest targets!

Split into two distinct sections, the film deals first with the fraught, but ultimately successful development of a new weapon by Dr. Barnes N. Wallis [Michael Redgrave]. The second and pacier section deals with the mission itself during the British raid on the Ruhr Dams, and its associated costs for the enemy and for the British airmen.

Adapted by R.C. Sherriff from Paul Brickhill's book Enemy Coast Ahead and featuring superlative special effects photography by Gilbert Taylor, to say nothing of Eric Coates' stirring theme tune. THE DAM BUSTERS was Britain's biggest box-office success of 1955. Shot in black-and-white to allow the integration of original footage of the bomb trails, the film boasts a 'gritty' documentary-style reality. Michael Andersons 1955 dramatisation of the 1943 RAF mission to bomb German dams is fairly true to life and bounces along entertainingly.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE DAM BUSTERS [1954] is based on the true heroic RAF pilots, that on the night of 16 - 17 May 1943, 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, later nicknamed the Dam Busters  carried out Operation Chastise to attack German dams in the Ruhr valley. The film begins with aviation engineer Dr. Barnes N. Wallis [Michael Redgrave] developing a bouncing bomb. He spends hours and hours shooting golf balls up and down, complains the supervisor of an experimental ship tank in Teddington, and every now and then he breaks a window. It would be a struggle for screenwriters to get anything like the amount of exposition in this script past a studio executive today, yet the clear explanations of technical, military and engineering details are one of the reasons second world war enthusiasts love this film. There are a few minor inaccuracies, but they are not bloopers. Parts of Upkeep, as Dr. Barnes N. Walliss project was codenamed, were classified until 1963. This is why the bouncing bombs which in real life were cylindrical are spherical in the film.

Faced with largely fictional obstructions from the Government bureaucracy and from his employer, Vickers, Dr. Barnes N. Wallis goes to Arthur Bomber Harris [Basil Sydney], head of Bomber Command. Arthur Bomber Harris remains a controversial figure today, particularly for his involvement in and justification of the bombing of Dresden. Thats a separate issue from the story here. Still, its worth noting that, in real life, Arthur Bomber Harris was sceptical about Operation Chastise from the beginning. Rather than being supportive, as he is in the film, he called Dr. Barnes N. Walliss plan tripe beyond the wildest description.

A squadron is formed under wing commander Wing Commander Guy Gibson, V.C., D.S.O., D.F.C. of the Royal Air Force [Richard Todd] and his male black Labrador retriever and was also the mascot of 617 Squadron. Certainly the name in this film is historically accurate, and it is also true that the dogs name was used as a code word during Operation Chastise which means a Morse code operator has to shout it with great gusto at a key moment in the film. Yet there was far less awareness in Britain during the 1940s and 1950s of the harm caused by using such language and so, in real life and in the film, Guy Gibsons dogs name was respected at the time.

The technical achievement of staging both the test flights and the bombing raid itself for the film was very impressive. The film-makers had four Lancaster bombers rather than the full complement of 19. They were borrowed from the RAF, which also lent pilots to perform the terrific stunt flying. The film has fun with dramatic licence; especially watching showgirls dance in spotlights at a London theatre gives Guy Gibson the idea for the Dam Busters spot lamp altimeter. In real life, this was designed by Ben Lockspeiser of the ministry of aircraft production who went on to be the first president of the council of CERN, which as you may know stands astride the Swiss-French border, close to Geneva, and is one of the jewels in Europe's crown, a demonstration of what can be achieved through worldwide collaboration. Today it hosts around 11,000 scientific users from its Member and Associate Member States and other regions in the world who come to CERN to pursue their research work at the Organisations facilities.

The raids on the Mhne and Eder dams as shown in the film were successful; the Sorpe dam was not breached, and its bombing does not make it to the screen. Undoubtedly, THE DAM BUSTERS film is right in suggesting that Operation Chastise greatly boosted British morale and it was an extraordinary and courageous achievement for all the men involved. Yet the hopes of Dr. Barnes N. Wallis and others that bombing the dams might seriously damage the German war effort or even shorten the conflict and were not really borne out. There is evidence Operation Chastise put a dent in German coal production, but little more than that. Of the 1,650 or so people killed by the flooding, more than 1,000 turned out to be forced labour camp inmates and prisoners of war, mostly Ukrainian, Dutch, French and Belgian. Arthur Bomber Harris himself was disappointed in the results of the operation: It achieved nothing compared with the effort and the loss, he wrote in 1945.

The actual raid occupies surprisingly little screen time, with Dr. Barnes N. Wallis, his invention and his determined pursuit of the idea making up the bulk of the film. Director Michael Anderson's clear intention is to celebrate the unsung heroes of the wartime period, and to highlight one facet of Britain's national identity. In demonstrating the way in which Dr. Barnes N. Wallis's inventions are routinely confronted by the insufferable bureaucratic negativity and director Michael Anderson also passes critical comment on Britain's dismal tendency to stifle genius. The decision was made to shoot the film in black-and-white, in order to allow the integration of original footage of the bomb trials, and to preserve a 'gritty', documentary-style reality. By good fortune, the Ruhr was in flood at the time of shooting, allowing the crew to film the flooded towns and valleys and incorporates this into the closing scenes. It is testament to director Michael Anderson's authoritative, quiet guidance that the performances are largely realistic, and multi-dimensional. The end of the film might, in other hands, be an opportunity for jingoistic flag-waving, but instead director Michael Anderson emphasises the human cost of war without falling into sentimentality.

Blu-ray Video Quality  StudioCanal presents us this Blu-ray in a stunning 1080p black-and-white crisp image, with an equally nice 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Also outstanding is the picture quality that is positively beautiful and stunning at the same time and you feel like it was filmed in the 21st century. This black-and-white film from yesteryear has been reinvented on Blu-ray and given a new lease on life. The picture is crisp and ever so clear, and no cropping burdens the transfer, something that appears far too often in HD remasters of older films, but sadly now and again you get a white line down the centre of the screen, shame they could not of done some work on the negative to get rid of this anomaly. At 125 minutes it is a fairly long film and one that I had not seen for years prior to purchasing this Blu-ray disc, but what a refreshing, enjoyable experience to relive once to salute these brave heroes who helped save the Second World War and defeat the Nazis. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  StudioCanal presents us this Blu-ray that offers a much appreciated crispness, clarity, nuance and weight to the proceedings. Take for example the first outdoor model test very early on. It takes place at an airstrip, out of the way. On the Blu-ray we can clearly make out background sounds of other airplanes taxiing about as well as other machinery and people out of the frame; also the sound of walking on wood planks is correctly manifest itself, that is of greatest importance is that the uncompressed audio track permits an emotional inflection of voices utterly absent on the inferior DVD. How else are we able to make sense out of and empathize with Michael Redgrave's hesitant enthusiasm as he tries to sell his idea for the destruction of the dams, or Richard Todd's boyish matter of fact delivery of the mission to his men? On the inferior DVD if you close your eyes and just listen to the dialogue, there is very little in their speaking that supports the drama. Next to these improvements, the extra slam we hear from explosives sounds on the Blu-ray is just icing on the cake.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: DAMBUSTERS: 617 Squadron Remember [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [56:27] Here we have an Exclusive brand new documentary presented by historian Max Arthur and author of Dambusters about the real-life mission, and featuring the surviving members of the 617 Squadron. We get mixed view about Wing Commander Guy Gibson, V.C., D.S.O., D.F.C. of the Royal Air Force (12th August 1918  19th September 1944), who had completed over 170 operations at the age of 26 and some of the crew says he was a wonderful professional pilot, but if you did not do a professional job up to his standards, you were kicked out of the team, but as stated he was only 26 years of age, so there was a lot of pressure on this team leader. We get to see old newsreels of the testing of the bouncing bomb and the crew getting ready for their mission. All the 617 Squadron people interviewed said that they got a fantastic thrill when they were doing the low flying test runs and at the same time very it was exhilarating, especially when they did the actual ""Dam Busters"" raid. Because everything was so hush hush top secret right up to the actual night bombing raid, they all speculated on what the mission and actual target would be, some thought it was going to be a battle shipping convoy because of the very low flying. We hear that they had to build specially designed Avro Lancaster bombers that were designed by Roy Chadwick, CBE, FRSA, FRAeS who was an aircraft design engineer for the Avro Company, and was completely different, so it could hold the Bouncing Bomb. In the documentary film, we are informed that the specially designed Avro Lancaster bombers had to fly 60 feet above the water, but on the night of the raid, they actually had to fly 30 feet above the water, because the lower you went, there was less trouble for the Bouncing Bomb. When they had finished the raid and headed for England, the German pilots tried to stop them, but totally failed as they did not know here the Avro Lancaster bombers were. On the morning of the 17th May, 1943, the Avro Lancaster bombers of the 617 Squadron returned from their successful epic raid on the dams, one by one, but for some unknown reason there was no celebration and so the pilots went straight bed, totally exhausted, but later on they found out the Officers had a celebratory party. By the next day they found out Eight crew went down and of course never returned home, which was roughly 50% of the crew that lost their lives, but of course all the crew that was interviewed in this special documentary, said that in a war situation, you inevitably expect the consequences, as they knew they had a job to do. Also all who went on the raid were very proud and honoured that they helped to shorten the Second World War. Contributors include Flight Lieutenant Les Munro [RNZAF] [Pilot of the 617 Squadron], Sergeant Ray Grayston [Flight Engineer of the 617 Squadron], Sergeant Fred Sunderland [Front Gunner of the 617 Squadron], Flight Sergeant Grant McDonald [RCAF] [Rear Gunner of the 617 Squadron] and Sergeant Johnny Johnson [Bomb Aimer of the 617 Squadron]. Unlike many Second World War documentaries on Blu-ray discs, this extra is thankfully in full 1080p HD.

Finally, THE DAM BUSTERS [1954] is very much a piece of its time, but it remains a totally splendidly made war film and if you don't mind a few touches of embellishment, especially a respectably accurate retelling of Operation Chastise. This brilliant film was a record of a British operational triumph during the last part of the Second World War, and as stated earlier THE DAM BUSTERS film was adapted from Paul Brickhill's Enemy Coast Ahead and is a small slice of history, told with painstaking attention to detail and overflowing with the British quality of understatement. For more than 125 minutes, the film is devoted to the planning and preparation, and very absorbing material this proves to be. The reconstruction of the raid and the pounding of the dams are done with graphic realism. The aerial photography is one of the major technical credits. The production is a personal triumph for Michael Anderson. Michael Redgrave, particularly, gives a vividly human portrayal of Dr. Barnes N. Wallis the scientist while Richard Todd makes a distinguished showing as Wing Commander Guy Gibson, V.C., D.S.O., D.F.C. of the Royal Air Force commander. Highly Recommended!

1993098,5,B0001DYG1U,"In 1942, a mostly self-educated engineer named Barnes Wallis came up with an extraordinary idea for smashing some of Germanys most important hydroelectric dams along the Ruhr River.  Impervious to any explosive ordinance that existed at the time, Wallis believed that the dams could be breached by a bouncing bomb that would skip across the surface of the reservoir, stopping just short of the dam wall, sink to the correct depth and explode, with the water serving to intensify the force of the blast.  Once the idea was approved, only about nine weeks were available for the theory to be refined, the bombs designed, tested and fabricated, the aircraft modified and twenty crews trained to fly at tree top level, at night, through enemy occupied territory and drop bombs with pinpoint accuracy.  Amazingly, they succeeded.

This much loved film does an excellent job of summarising the main events of this remarkable story, especially considering that in 1954, when it was made, most of the details of Operation Chastise, as it was formally known, were still classified.

The film incorporates genuine footage of some of the preliminary testing with a little scrubbing by the censors.  Curiously, they missed one important bit and there is one sequence where the backwash produced by the spinning bomb (back spun to produce lift through the Magnus effect) is visible.  That was one of the most highly classified aspects of the project.

Yes the film is shown on a 4.3 screen, no the film is not a 'high defenition' transfer, yes it does have the odd scratch showing, however the picture is a 'little' sharper than the 'dvd' version., one has to remember it is filmed in 'black and white' to accommidate the 'real' pic's of the actual testing of the 'bomb's, also the special effects on this '55' year-old film are obviously 'dated'
the story tells of the struggle 'Dr Barnes H Wallis' had in convincing both the 'military' and 'political' authorities of the time that his idea to hit at the heart of the german industial complex was a viable option.
when the plan was finaly accepted, 'wing commander' 'Guy Gibson' was appointed to both train the air-crews, and then lead the the mission.
The raid would be fraught with danger from both enemy-fire and the low-flying that would be needed to release the bombs on the 'dams'
It truly reflects the bravery of the men involved on the raid, in fact '8' lancaster's and there '54' crew members never returned.
'Guy Gibson' had been involved in many missions both before and after this event, his luck did finaly run out when his plane suffered a fuel problem flying over dutch territory 'september' 1944........he was '26' years old.
the film was a massive hit way back in 1955, and of course includes one of the best known 'music' scores of all time.

The film is in two parts, the testing and planing of the bombing raid and the second part the training of the flight crews and the raid itself.  The movie is based on real events that sort of succeeded in blowing two dams.  The movie is well paced and directed.  The Wing commander of the Raid is played by Richard Todd, he was also in The Longest Day.  As in officer in WWII he lost men in his battalion and had to write letters to the families of the soldiers under his command who died in Combat.  At the end of the movie, he is seen waling off to write the same type of letters again.  The emotion he displays is real because he had done that during the war.  If you pay attention, you will see the acting debut of Patrick McGoohan, the future ""Secret Agent Man"" as a door guard.

1993157,4,B0001DYG1U,"I really think of this as an all-time great movie.  However, viewing it recently - it just didn't hold me like it use to.  That's why I didn't rate this a 5-star flick.  Maybe I'll feel differently the next time I view it, and raise the rating.
I'm a sucker for war-time dramas, especially when based upon true events.  And this amazing movie is one that attracted me just from the first time I heard the ""Dam Busters March"" opening theme.  The trials and tribulations of Michael Redgrave's Barnes Wallis humanize this aspect of war, something no typically jingoistic flick even attempts.  You can feel his triumphs, his failures.  Actually, the first time I'd seen this, I really didn't believe anything so preposterous was even thought of, let alone utilized.
The packaging isn't anything to either praise or chastise.  Suffice to say it does the job.  As for the DVD itself, I really, really, really would love to hear a commentary track over this film - though the dialogue of the film itself tells the tale.",1423353600,,1012,4.704545454545454
1993158,5,B0001DYG1U,"This is one of the best movies about World War II because it deals with a real raid that was made on 3 of the Third Reich's dams that were of critical importance to their war effort.  The movie was made over a decade later and is simply, but very well, told.  They took a lot of pains to make it reflect what really happened.

The raid was a miracle of engineering:  the bridges were huge, almost impossible to hit with conventional bombs and hard to break if they did.  The fact that the mission was a success was due to an outstanding and wonderfully stubborn engineer by the name of Barnes-Wallis.  He worked through a number of problems and came up with a bomb that was shaped like a sphere, spun and then dropped at a specific altitude, at a specific speed and at a specific distance from the dam.  It skipped like a stone across the water to bypass the German netting and come to a rest against the dam where it could use the fact that water is very hard to compress, so when the bombs exploded against the dam the force was concentrated on the masonry and, eventually, it cracked and broke.  Barnes-Wallis got the idea from Lord Nelson, who sometimes had his cannon bounce cannon balls off the water to hit a ship.

The movie shows the process in some detail -- something that's not done enough in my opinion.  And it shows the mission itself, showing what the bomber crews did to get through and hit the dams.  That too is done in great detail.  They took pains to show everything as it was at the time, including the use of actual Lancaster bombers.

There is another DVD on this topic that I'd like to mention; that is the 2 hour Nova special ""Bombing Hitler's Dams"" which takes up where the movie leaves off.  It's more on the engineering side of things.  Highly recommended.",1422662400,,1786,4.36969696969697

1993176,5,B0001DYG1U,"I've always liked this film since it was presented realistically, showing not just the rosy side of the happening but the thorns and briars as well.  Michael Redgrave is excellent as the scientist/inventor Barnes Wallace, portraying him through his failures, miscalculations, and his final success in proving the experts wrong.  Richard Todd does an excellent job portraying Guy Gibson, the man to whom the ultimate job of delivering Wallace's special bombs to their respective targets and who had the ultimate glory in kicking Hitler right where it would hurt.  What makes the cheese more binding is that this movie is based on solid fact.  There really was a Squadron 617 and they really did put huge crimps in Hitler's plans more than once.  This film just shows the destruction of the Moehne and the Sorpe dams and the resulting damage from the floods.  In fact, Squadron 617's motto was ""Apres nous le deluge.""  Rather fitting, don't you think.  At any rate, it's five stars straight on down the line.  I have spoken!",1408320000,3,1022,4.895348837209302
1993177,5,B0001DYG1U,"The reputation of this classic 1954 British film directed by Michael Anderson has endured through the decades and grown stronger in recent years. This is remarkable because the film was made on a modest budget in monochrome and the rather primitive `special effects' of the aerial action sequences are in a different league to modern viewers' now-routine experience of sophisticated cutting-edge CGI supported by >$100 million budgets.

Why then is this film so highly regarded and not consigned to cinematic oblivion? The answer includes a sharp intelligent script and fine understated character acting especially from Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave. The fast-paced narrative story line is gripping and absorbing, with a documentary feel which the viewer knows is based closely on what actually happened. A few minor changes are made to enhance the drama like Wallis' battles with the Air Ministry to have his bouncing bomb idea accepted, when in reality the AM was enthusiastic and supportive from the start, but you can forgive these minor details because the end result is so excellent.

Guy Gibson himself was killed flying a Mosquito on operations over Europe in 1944, so though he survived the May 1943 Ruhr Dams raid he did not survive the war. However many of the other people portrayed in the film were still alive in 1954 and were consulted extensively to ensure the fine details were got right. The Avro Lancasters in the film are real aircraft still airworthy in 1954, and because the film was made only 9 years after the end of WW2 it has the look and feel of the period. Decades-later reconstructions rarely get right exactly how people looked and spoke, their values and selfless devotion to duty so anachronistic in the 21st century, but here it's natural and true-to-life. The script has an economy of language and refreshing absence of mawkish emotional baggage (and no sub-plot to clog-up the action), qualities from which many aspiring contemporary film-makers might learn. The theme music by Eric Coates is one of the most instantly recognisable film scores in cinematic history, perfect in tone with an enduring power which endows the story with a kind of nobility and sense of great occasion.

The `Special Anniversary' 1080p Blu-Ray is a fine sharp print of the original, unedited film. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1, so nothing is cropped. The picture quality is so good that it looks as though the original negative has been extensively restored (as with the recent `World at War' series Blu-Ray release) with fine greyscales, deep blacks, near-perfect contrast and no flicker. The image quality stands up well in the company of more recent monochrome productions like `Schindler's List' and `The Artist'.

The sound is good, too: not great, but more than acceptable for a 60-year old film. You get a couple of extras, the longest of which is a talking-heads based documentary on the raid and 617 Squadron's other wartime exploits, featuring the few now-very-aged survivors - this in color and in 16:9 to fit current TV screens.

For the image quality alone, this Blu-Ray release can be unconditionally recommended. In an unedited script Guy Gibson's pet labrador retains his name, in 1943 England a centuries-old word in common use for a specific shade of dark brown, completely absent the baggage attached to it in the USA with its very different racial-social history (in Peter Jackson's proposed new remake, in a gesture towards modern PC sensibilities the dog is reportedly to be referred to throughout as `Nigsy', a pet name Gibson often used when calling his labrador which steers the hound clear of possible controversy).",1408320000,2,3656,5.0664451827242525

1993193,5,B0001DYG1U,"This war film based on actual events is an already immortal classic, still as powerful in Year of Grace 2014 as it was when first released in 1955. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

1. Operation ""Chastise"" and real ""Dam Busters""

Operation Chastise was an attack on three German dams carried out on 16-17 May 1943 by Royal Air Force No. 617 Squadron flying specially modified Lancaster bombers and using a new weapon: ""bouncing bomb"" invented and developed by renown engineer Barnes Wallis (amongst his earlier realisations was the design of Vickers Wellington bomber). This mission was unusually dangerous because to succeed British bombers had to attack at low speed and very low attitude, risking at any moment crashing in the ground, when in the same time being exceptionally vulnerable to the Flak, including the numerous 20 mm guns, which usually were not a concern to four engine bombers operating at high attitude...

As the result of the attack, the Mhne and Edersee Dams were breached, causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley - the third target, Sorpe dam, sustained only minor damage. Two hydroelectric power plants were destroyed and several more were damaged. Numerous factories and mines were also damaged to diverse degree due to flooding and an estimated 1,600 people drowned. Even if the damage was repaired by Germans, production in affected areas didn't return to normal before September 1943.

The cost to the attackers was high, as out of 20 Lancasters which took off for the attack 8 were lost and 53 crew members were killed with 3 more being taken prisoners.

What made this incredibly daring and very successful operation even more remarkable, was that, although it was not made on purpose, the 617th squadron was a very multinational and diverse outfit, with crews hailing from all over the Commonwealth: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and amongst the pilots there was even one American volunteer serving with RAF, Lieutenant Joe McCarthy.

Following the Dams Raid 617 Squadron was kept together as a specialist unit and participated in numerous bombing operations, frequently using other types of specialised ordnance developed by Barnes Wallis, including giant Grand Slam and Tallboy bombs. It was with those latter munitions that the 617th Squadron attacked and destroyed in 1944 German super-battleship Tirpitz in its base in Norway. The squadron is still active today.

Very sadly, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the officer in command of the whole mission, didn't survive the war - he was killed in action (probably shot down by a German fighter) on 19 September 1944, when flying a target marking Mosquito over Netherlands. He was only 26 years old. Five of men who flew on the same bomber with him in operation ""Chastise"" were killed even earlier, during another bombing mission over Germany on 16 September 1943.

2. The film

The film was made in 1955, when Barnes Wallis and many ""Dam Busters"" were still alive, therefore it was possible to consult with them extensively and as result this film sticks quite closely to the reality of things. This real deal feeling was also helped by RAF contributing three real Lancaster bombers taken out of reserve and refit for service for the needs of this film.

The narration is strictly chronological, from the moment when Barnes Wallis got the idea of ""bouncing bombs"", through the phase of conception of those new munitions, experimentation and modifications until finally the introduction in service. Then begins the phase of selection of crews for the mission, training and other preparations and finally the extremely dramatic mission itself.

For the needs of the film some changes were of course introduced, the most important of which is the whole struggle Barnes Wallis has to wage with war time bureaucracy (both civilian and military) to even be able to launch the whole project of ""bouncing bombs"". In reality no such thing took place, to the contrary, Wallis, who was already very well known in this time, received lots of support and was efficiently backed up by both civilian and military hierarchy, which explains how this project advanced so fast.

Another interesting thing is that in 1955 the whole ""bouncing bomb"" technology was still a military secret, therefore in the film the bombs have the shape of spheres, when in the reality they were shaped as barrels...

Finally, another major change was made to make the action even more dramatic - in the film one of the bombers crashes into a mountain as it is not able to pull up fast enough from the bomb run (I am NOT saying which bomber it is...). In reality no such thing happened during the bomb run but some planes damaged by Flak crash landed after the attack itself was over.

The music written for this film is of course already a legend - the ""Dambusters March"" achieved already immortality and will certainly continue to be performed, listened to and adored for centuries.

3. My impressions about the film

The first time I saw this film was ages ago, in communist Poland, when I was still a boy - and it was an ""eyes wide open, nail biting, jaw dropping"" experience! And now, after re-watching it recently, I was very pleased to see that with time it didn't lose any of its fire power!

The success of the film is certainly not due to special effects which in 1955 were nothing like those available today. This film is also in black and white and action scenes happen at night, which should logically diminish their impact - but it is NOT the case! No, the real reason why ""Dambusters"" is so good is the strength of scenario and a perfectly structured narration of the story, an art frequently forgotten (or simply discarded) in today's films. The tension is build up from the beginning, with initially just a hint that something REALLY big is going to happen and then the stakes are raised slowly but regularly, until the moment when Gibson and his men see this first dam... At that moment the viewers couldn't care less about special effects as we are already so immersed in the story that no escape is possible, even if the Flak started to shoot spaghetti instead of tracers...

To conclude on the action scenes - their age notwithstanding they still pack such power that together with the great finale from ""633 Squadron"" (a lesser war film describing a fictitious raid) they very strongly inspired George Lucas when he was creating the archi-famous sequence of rebel fighters attacking Death Star in ""Star Wars"".

The way in which the heroism of those incredible men is described is another treasure. The whole story is narrated in a matter of fact way, as if it was just another day at the office - it just so happens that the office for those men is deep inside the enemy territory. There is no pathos, there is no drama, there is no soul searching, there is no PrTSD (Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder, something that figures in most of modern war movies), no politically correct pseudo-psychological babble (are we the good guys? Are we REALLY the good guys? Are we REALLY, REALLY, REALLY the good guys?), which all affect so badly so many modern war films.

Here things are told simply and calmly and the viewers are trusted to be adult enough to understand by themselves how terribly dangerous that mission was and how it took real balls to fly at the lowest possible level into this Valley of the Shadows of Death, with Flak in the front, on both sides and even above(!) on the hills, carrying an enormous bomb exposed to enemy fire and still go at the target - MORE THAN ONCE if the first approach was unsuccessful!

I heard many rumours that a remake of ""Dambusters"" is being prepared in USA, but until now nothing concrete was ever announced. Honestly, I am of two minds about it - on one hand I would be tempted to see this raid again, with the state of the art XXI century special effects but on another, when I think of all the abominations, horrors and other indignities visited lately upon war stories by Hollywood (just think of ""Pearl Harbour"", ""U-571"" or ""Wind Talkers"") I would as much prefer that at least this masterpiece remains unspoiled...

There were many book written abouth this famous raid, but if I was to recommend just one I think I would go with ""Dambusters. Operation Chastise 1943"" by Doug Dildy, published by Osprey in its ""Raid"" series in October 2010. It is a small book, only 80 pages long, but quite comprehensive and it may be a good idea to read it before watching (re-watching) this film.

CONCLUSION: this is a GREAT film, a GREAT classic, still as powerful today as in 1955. To buy, watch, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!",1390348800,,8693,4.811662198391421

1993208,4,B0001DYG1U,"The Dam Busters is a really well- executed and complete record of a very unique mission.  It starts with an introduction of Barnes Wallis, the man who designed an ingenious bomb specifically for the destruction of some enemy dams.  Earlier in his career he was an aircraft designer for Vickers.  His unique ""geodetic"" theories were incorporated in the famous Vickers Wellington medium bomber.  This includes an extensive telling of the R & D and testing of various prototypes leading up to the final portrayal of the mission itself.  You get a sense of the man himself, and his sense of duty to his country.  His personal bravery and ""Get 'er done"" outlook served England well in those dark days of WW2.  Richard Todd is a good choice as the overall commander of the raid, Guy Gibson.  Gibson was a very short man who had a reputation for great courage and organization.  Todd fulfills this role admirably.  The special effects are somewhat below the standards of the time, with some poor model-work.

I had watched it online through a legitimate movie provider ( I am not naming names, though I think you know which one I am referring to) and I have to say the version online is superior to this DVD.

Both the audio and video quality are inferior to the online video service I mentioned. Poor contrast, and the audio clips where it ought not to. Also the packaging looks childish, like something made at home.

Don't get me wrong this is a fantastic story, very close to what happened minus some literary license. The special effects are not fantastic, but easily overlooked by the accomplishments of the men involved in the bouncing bomb. This is a great movie, but the quality of the conversion to DVD is a disservice to the people involved with the film, the people involved in the actual bouncing bomb, and Sir Barnes Wallis himself.

It is quite refreshing and rather strange not to set through another Yankee Doodle or Green Berets or a Pearl Harbor film of war but instead a true recreation of serious history. There are, as far as I can tell only two mistakes, the doctor claims to have designed the bomber himself...this is not quite true and the bomb was not a ""ball"" shape, but rather more a ""can"" shape (this was kept secret from the public for many years so the film makers had no idea). All in all this is a very good copy of a very good movie.

I care not to remember how many years ago I viewed this movie for the first time but I enjoyed it as much now as I did then ! Watch for Robert Shaw of the movies "" Battle of Britain "" & "" Jaws "" as Guy Gibson's co/pilot. I once watched a TV review of this movie & one of the questions the host asked the special effects man was: "" How did you make some of the Flak scenes so realistic as the German gunners fired at the A/ C "" ? His reply was we had very limited special effects as in today's world but we could fudge the film with a little Hollywood trickery & angles but for some scenes we used actual artillery fire with ex-gunners from WW2 ,
of course they knew how to lead or follow the A/C while placing the rounds harmlessly away from the A/C but with proper camera angles & a little trickery we got it pretty close. I found that pretty interesting as my Dad was an anti/aircraft gunner on the front during WW2. My Dad took me to see the movie as he was quite familiar with the raid. He commented on how real some of the tracer shells looked as the German's fired the Flak up at the A/C. Something to think about while you're viewing this great movie & where else are you going to see that many Lancaster A/C in the air all at once. A good historical , true story ! AND if you're going to obtain the 3-disc set "" The Ultimate DAM BUSTERS Collection "" this DVD "" The Dam Busters "" is a must own companion.

1993262,5,B0001DYG1U,"I caught this movie on TCM a year or so ago and was so impressed with the writing, directing, and the acting.  The movie is based on a true story of a top secret plan that was devised to use a new type of bomb to blow up three of the dams in Germany that provided the power to the Nazis and their weapons manufacturing facilities.  By destroying the dams, power would be cut off and thus would cripple their production of weapons and munitions.  The movie is based on two books ""The Dam Busters"" by Paul Brickhill and ""Enemy Coast Ahead"" by Guy Gibson.  Both authors were RAF pilots who flew combat missions in WWII in Europe.  The story of the scientist who has developed an idea for a bomb that skips along the water and impacts itself into a dam paired with the story of the RAF Squadron that carried out this incredibly dangerous mission is riveting.  This WWII film delves heavily into the great work that went into creating new weapons to help the Allies win the war as well as the intense training that went on to carry out these dangerous missions.",1285027200,,1056,4.362244897959184
1993263,5,B0001DYG1U,"This film, made in 1955, portrays the development of an idea by a British aircraft engineer to produce a bomb that could be used to destroy major dams that would flood the industrial Rhur Valley. This bomb was unique in that it needed to be dropped from extremely low altitude, and the bomb would then skip across the surface of the water, and over log booms and torpedo nets deployed to protect the dams.

The film does an excellent job showing the work and anguish of the inventor as he struggles to meet a deadline set by a combination of factors such as high water levels in the dams, and moon.

The acting is quite good, and the thing I really liked about it was that they didn't use special effects while showing the testing of the bomb, it looks like they used actual footage shot during the testing of the bombs. Of course, there were some special effects in the film, and they are unavoidably outdated, but did an adequate job for the times.

All in all this is a top-notch behind the scenes war film that includes some nice filming of low-level flying of British Lancaster 4-engine heavy bombers.",1285027200,,1106,4.492537313432836
1993264,5,B0001DYG1U,Great WWII movie based on historic fact.  Really shows how applied science overcame the skeptics.  The subject of the movie was only one of Dr. Barnes Wallis's many important contributions to the war effort.  Great story and well acted.,1280620800,6,236,5.0
1993265,4,B0001DYG1U,"It took me awhile to get through all of The Dam Busters, but it was worth it in the end.  It's a long movie as these things go and must have been crazy expensive to produce back in the day, what with borrowing and restoring all those Lancasters, etc.

The star power is pretty evenly divided between Michael Redgrave, his hair dusted gray and white, seemingly in a replay of his famous star turn as the lonely schoolmaster in The Browning Version.  Redgrave plays a top scientist boffin who can't get the government to fund his costly experiments into a better way to bomb  the three hydroelectric dams of the Ruhr Valley.  The movie plays it fair and thus makes it more suspenseful, in that Redgrave's plans do seem a little bit crazy and one can't quite believe they would ever work in real life....  And his diffident slash egotistical way of presenting his arguments doesn't help win him any converts.  So the whole first hour of the film is built around his struggle and how he nearly gave up.  His wife, played by beloved British actress Ursula Jeans, has very little to do but sew the buttons back on her absent minded professor husband and hold his hand when he's feeling blue and misunderstood.  We never get a sense of what she's about or what she wants to happen, in the war or otherwise.  Jeans doesn't bring much to the part, but if you like maternal love she delivers it in big bundles.  Redgrave's own sexual conflicts color our watching of The Dam Busters nowadays, so that the repeated storyline of him returning to his wife, defeated by the big boys, his tail between his legs, has another message which he seems to be playing with constantly.

Part Two brings us Richard Todd as the flight commander with the adorable dog.  Todd is excellent in the part, though he seems strangely short next to the strapping chaps he serves with, like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.  Was Todd really a little man?  His dog is as big s he is.  This dog has a pleasing personality but an unfortunate name which makes me dislike the real life pilot who could name his pet such a thing.  And they don't just use the name once--which would have been painful enough--they keep calling him the name, over and over--at least a dozen times.  I don't know what black people make of this film, but I can see why the BBC had a showing where they scrambled the dog's name to ""Trigger.""  Censorship, or just common sense?  Anyhow Todd whips his boys into shape and has one great scene where, discouraged about the difficulties of low flying over water, he takes his friend to a West End musical and in the middle of a spectacular chorus girl number, he gets the perfect idea from watching how expert stagehands illuminate the musical theater!  They should adapt this scene for Glee!  I understand that in real life, this inspiration did not happen quite this way, but it is super effective on film.  Kudos to scenarist R.C. Sherriff, the man who wrote the classic antiwar drama JOURNEY'S END, then sold out and wrote more than his share of pro-war movies for all the big studios.  His skill never deserted him.  And even more kudos to director Michael Anderson, too often dismissed as a journeyman hack, but who shows in this film at least the speed, efficiency, suspense and camaraderie of a Howard Hawks or Anthony Mann.",1273363200,5,3303,4.548223350253807

The score is memorable, and Michael Redgrave gives contemporary actors something to aim for.  Although it builds slowly, it holds one's attention throughout and even though I'd seen it before and knew the ending, my muscles tautened as I watched the bombers take off on their historic mission: It was as if I were flying along with the crews.
If you're a fan of WW II films, you'll want this one in your collection (if it isn't already there).  And keep an eye peeled for a VERY young Robert Shaw as a member of one of the bomber crews.

1993272,5,B0001DYG1U,"This is a 1954 B&W movie based on a 1951 book by Paul Brickhill. Both the book and the movie are excellent.

This film is packed with action, and the tension is maintained throughout. There is not a dull moment. There is a great deal of atmosphere in every major scene. The actors are good and the production is quite realistic. Some of the special effects are not very well executed though. I am sure they could have done better, even with the technological limitations of the early fifties.

Speaking of technology, the first part of this movie deals with the challenge of destroying a dam that is 120 feet thick at the base. We spend a long time witnessing the development of an audacious idea concocted by a scientist who has to go through various trials and tribulations before his concept is vindicated. So the first half of the movie would qualify as a documentary in that regard. But there is just as much action and tension here as there are in the bombing scenes that follow. For the whole story is threaded with a seamless fabric.

The second half of the movie deals with the actual bombing of three German dams in the Rhur Valley. That is what we had been waiting for and it is delivered like an apotheoses. It is indeed the climax of the movie. But the tension is only released after numerous attempts. There is a ""feel good"" part here. But the triumph is somewhat mitigated by the heavy casualties. That is what makes it a great war movie.",1244332800,2,1453,4.475471698113208

The film itself was a joy for me to watch.  I knew the outlines of the story, in which a secret, innovative weapon was developed to attack the Ruhr dams during World War II.  What made it special was that this is one of a SMALL handful of films in which the engineering process is dramatized well.  Not only is the engineer the lead of the story, but he does not work miracles; the weapon progresses from idea, through concept, subscale models, and full scale use, with problems and setbacks at each stage.

1993279,5,B0001DYG1U,"This film was exciting when I saw it in 1956 in Holland, and it is just as exciting now. How can one miss with the superb talent of Michael Redgrave, the stirring music of Eric Coates, and a gripping yarn that happens to be true?  Much of the fascination of this film stems from its depiction of Barnes Wallis's process of planning and perfecting the bouncing bomb, and persuading Whitehall to go along with his eccentric idea. Equally interesting are the various makeshift devices, such as the range-finding lights and the home-made bombsight.

""The Dam Busters"" tells the story of ingenuity and courage during wartime. In the wrong hands, such a topic might be heavy handed, but one of the things that British filmmakers of the 1950s did so well was to deliver their patriotic messages with a touch of wry humor mixed with just the right amount of pathos. The camera may not focus on exploding planes or dwell on the devastating effects for the inhabitants of the Ruhr valley, but in leaving such details to the collective imagination of the audience, the director has developed cinematic understatement into a fine art.",1213920000,21,1122,4.808290155440415

The movie has been a favorite of mine ever since, though I've had to put up with TV reruns or scratched and worn VHS until this wonderful new edition.",1199318400,10,646,4.577586206896552
1993281,4,B0001DYG1U,"The movie deals with the attack by the RAF on German dams over the river Ruhr , destruction of which  would inflict a blow to the German war machine by damaging its  industrial capacity..It is a movie in two  parts .The first details the invention and testing of the legendary ""bouncing bomb""by the great inventor Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave).The second part deals with the training of the air crews chosen to carry out the raid ,building up to the night of the raid itself. The raid is  lead by Wing Commander Guy Gibson(Richard Todd)

Redgrave is exceptional in his portrait of the ultimate ""back room boffin"",an eccentric scientific genius who treads a fine line between inspiration and obsession. He doggedly pursues his plan to strike a decisive blow right to the heart of the enemy with a single decisive dagger thrust rather than, as he brillinatly describes the strategic bombimg offensive ,""kill him with a million peashooters"" .The picture gives us a detailed evocation of the research and development of the weapon often in the face of obstructionism from the civil service .It is a world of windswept firing  ranges and chilly test tanks .The movie does not gloss over either the failures and false starts or the obstacles thrown up by petty bureaucracy.

In the second part ,as the night of the raid draws ever nearer  the camera dwells on the small group of men who must carry out the attack -the focus is on their rituals as thw wait in their various ways to be called into action ,knowing that many will not return. They play impromptu games of cricket,lounge upon the grass or simply patiently sit and wait their call to action. The raid is skillfully shot by director Anderson and he is at his best in the scenes following the raid,s completion -empty tables in the mess halls,clocks ticking in the stillness ,as the camera prowls through the rooms of the dead liongering on empty chairs and vacant soaces in the mess hall. The shot of Gibson walking away to write letters to the relatives of those who did not return is doubly poignant when you realise it was a task that fell to Todd -who served in World War 2 -in real life.

This movie deatils a small scale operation with big repercussions and does so in a semi-documentary style which makes it truly compelling viewing .It is a portrait of understated heroism greatly helped by R C Sheriff's sensitive screenplay and a slew of admirable performances

Special praise is due to the bravura Dam Busters March by Eric Coates a piece of music that is a hardy perennial in the British movie score cstalogue .

1993283,5,B0001DYG1U,"If you are a fan of WWII history then this is the film for you.  It is the true story of RAF Bomber Command's raids on the Mhne and Eder dams. Additionally it's the story of 617 squadron's birth; which even today is one the RAF's most successful and highly decorated squadrons.  The special effects are a bit primitive by today's standards; however because of this the actors actually have to act.  If you can find it I strongly encourage reading the terrific book The Dam Busters by Paul Brickhill.

Some of the more interesting points of the movie are: The death of Wing Commander Gibson's dog, just before the raid.  Then there is the somber silence we have for the crews who where lost.  Like the missing crews at the mess table, or the ""If I don't return letter"" sitting on the desk.  Then at the very end Guy Gibson telling Barnes Wallis after the raid that he needs ""to write a few letters before turning in"".

On the comical side there is the poultry farmer writing a nasty letter to the RAF.  This poor man has the misfortune to live near one of the lakes that 617 squadron is using to practice over before the raid.  The poor old fellow is just trying to make an honest living and support Britain's war effort, when there are dozens of 4 engine Lancaster Bombers roaring over his farm at 60 Feet off the ground day and night.

A minor word of caution to any viewers who are Black, the name of Wing Commander Gibson's dog refers to what once a legitimate colour (very dark chocolate brown) in Great Britain.  As opposed to the more modern and now almost universal racial swear for people who are Black.  Please remember this 1952 movie was intended to be a reasonable historically accurate movie, based upon the events of 1942.

Again a really top notch movie with some superb shots of the Lancaster Bomber.

1993284,5,B0001DYG1U,"1954's ""The Dam Busters"" is a detailed and dramatic account of the heroic British Royal Air Force raid against three dams in the Ruhr Valley of Germany during the Second World War.  The dams were considered virtually immune to conventional bombing techniques; the raid was notable for the use of experimental five ton bombs delivered at low attitude against the inside face of the dams.  The raid was unfortunately also notable for the high casualties among the raiders.  The squadron that carried off the raid lost eight of 19 planes, with 56 of 133 men killed.

The first half of the story is built around the efforts of inventor Barnes Wallis (Michael Redgrave) to convince a reluctant military bureaucracy to use his unique round bombs.  The second half is the painstaking training of the dam busters by Wing Commander Guy Gibson (Richard Todd).  The actual attack is a thrilling series of flying sequences, as Lancaster bombers maneuver through curtains of flak to hit the proper release point to bounce their bombs into the dams.

The movie benefits from the use of period aircraft, equipment, uniforms and the like.  The special effects were cutting edge for their day.  The black and white photography is crisp and realistic.  It is rather unfortunate that the pilots spend much of the movie hidden behind their oxygen masks.  The movie makes an unmistakable point about the sacrifices of the pilots and aircrew who didn't make it home.  Highly recommended.",1185062400,,1465,4.959016393442623

It's about the efforts of a far-seeing inventor who conceived a method of destroying German dams with a special bomb. Two problems had to be solved. The first the design of the bomb and the physics of it's deployment. This was headed by the somewhat eccentric physicist/engineer, Barns Wallis, who's crazy idea was only accepted because he had a remarkable track record for crazy ideas that worked.  The second was to find a way of delivering it. This was achieved by a brave, disciplined, group of bomber crews who had to fly onto enemy ground fire while positioning the aircraft at an exact distant and height before releasing the bomb. The raid destroyed 3 hydro-electric dams but cost the lives of 56 airman.

It's about the effort to bomb two dams in the Ruhr.  Because of their design, dams are particularly hard to bomb, so they needed a new method to bomb them.  The idea of skip bombing came up and they tried it.  This is the movie about that.

1993288,3,B0001DYG1U,"It has been many years since I first saw this film and my memory made it a bit better than what it turns out to be. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent movie about the development of the ""bouncing bomb"" by Sir Barnes Wallis and the subsequent mission by Guy Gibson and his RAF pilots against the Nazi dams in the Ruhr. However, it appears most of the movie is about the development of the bomb (interesting, but not exactly high drama) and less about the actual mission.

As for the mission itself, you do catch glimpses of the mighty Lancaster bombers from time to time. Since the mission occurs at night the majority of the shots of the planes show only their dark silhouettes. But they are wonderful to see during the brief daylight training sequences. The scenes of the flight crews are top-notch.

Released in 1954, the film's special effects really do show their age by our current standards (also remember that WWII ended only 9 years earlier). There are many sequences using models and photo editing effects to produce tracer fire, explosions and to view bomb testing.

So I am just a bit disappointed as my nostalgia played a trick on me. It is a good movie for what it is and from the time of its creation. For an aviation / history buff (like myself) it is a nice addition to the home video library - especially if you can find it at a good price.

1993296,5,B0001DYG1U,"As with the Congress Entertainment DVD, this is a straight dub of the 1954 British film, including all the original video and audio. The story is very interesting, historically important, and well acted. I saw it not very long after its original release and enjoyed it then, and still do.

Given the very high regard the British have for Wing Commander Gibson, who was awarded Britain's highest military honor (Victoria Cross) for this raid and died in action just over a year later, I'm sure that - in 1954 - they were being very careful about accuracy, and left in historically accurate details which some will find offensive.

By ""modern"" (pre computer graphic animation) standards, the special effects are a bit primitive, but quite well done for 1954. Unlike the Congress Entertainment DVD, the audio and video quality are excellent, and the presentation is quite professional. Both may have been taken from the same original, as they both have a momentary frame freeze at one point.",1161907200,43,988,4.945783132530121
1993297,5,B0001DYG1U,This is a review of the movie only but past experience with Anchor Bay tells me the quality will be pretty good. This is the story of the planning and execution of the raid that led to the destruction of the Ruhr Valley Hydroelectric Dams during WW2 by the RAF. Very well acted and details the incredible engineering that went into the design of the bombs and the flying skill of the aircrews to be able to complete the mission. Outstanding WW2 movie. Semi-documentary in style but none the less a great piece of history. Don't miss this one.,1155340800,34,542,4.484848484848484
1993298,3,B0001DYG1U,"These comments apply to the Congress Entertainment DVD release from Lakeland Sales (who has not responded to my comments).

The good news about this DVD is that it exists, and is reasonably playable. The bad news is that the DVD has the production values you might expect from a garage or backroom operation.

Playability - Both high contrast and overall darkness require adjusting brightness/contrast for reasonable viewing. Audio level is high.

Production values - The disc itself is an inkjet-printable DVD-R, printed only with the movie title and a DVD logo. The clamshell case artwork is very blurry, printed crooked, and appears to be copied from a VHS slipcover - with many generations of copy from the original.

This is all unfortunate, as the story itself is very interesting, and well acted. I saw it not very long after its original release and enjoyed it then, and still do.  However, given the unfortunate (historically accurate) name of Wing Commander Gibson's dog, which reflects British vernacular of the period, it is unlikely that it will be re-released by a more professional source.

Given the very high regard the British have for Wing Commander Gibson, who was awarded Britain's highest military honor (Victoria Cross) for this raid and died in action just over a year later, I'm sure that - in 1954 - they were being very careful about accuracy.",1152576000,7,1370,4.9868421052631575
1993299,4,B0001DYG1U,"As Michael Redgrave's character observes in this 1953, based-on-a-true story of the WWII development and deployment of `bouncing' bombs used to destroy the great dams of Germany, and in the process cripple their industrial capacity, there's a thin dividing line between inspiration and obsession.  Redgrave plays the slightly potty shack-scientist Dr. Barnes N. Wallis, CBE, FRS.  Dr. Wallis has figured out why dams are so darn hard to blow up - in theory, anyway - and spends a good third of the movie convincing the powers that be to let him develop a practical bomb based on that theory.  Conventional attack, at least before Wallis applied his considerable intellect to the challenge, had bombs dropped from a great height a slight space away from the dam wall.  As the movie explains, that slight space and the water intervening between the bomb and the wall creates a cushion that neutralizes the bomb's force.  For them to work, bombs pretty much have to be touching the dam wall.  THE DAM BUSTERS spares us the mathematics involved, but only just - this is one of those movies that loves to linger over the details, and indulge its obsessive delight with gizmos and how things work.  Character development and interaction take a deep back seat to skip tests and the like.  If you like movies like that - I do - it shouldn't be much of a bother.

 About 1/3rd of the way in we're introduced to the other major character in this movie.  Richard Todd plays RAF Wing Commander Guy Gibson, VC, DSO, DFC (does anyone know what all those trailing letters stand for?)  Gibson is a gallant flight commander who is chosen to train a hand-picked squadron of men to attack the great dams of Germany - assuming, of course, Dr. Wallis can develop a working model in time.  While the good doctor is perfects his bomb, the fly boys are busy learning tricky new skills, namely low-altitude night flying.

If THE DAM BUSTERS isn't so great at developing characters, it's terrific at delivering the details.  One sequence takes us, step-by-step, through a trial run on one of the big Lancasters used to deliver the bomb.  Belts are strapped and buckled, instruments checked and rechecked, engines one through four fired up in sequence.  If scenes like this don't develop characters or build much tension when they're well done - and they're done well here - they put you there.

 I liked THE DAM BUSTERS quite a bit.  Redgrave is a very good actor, and he doesn't have to stretch much to play the slightly withdrawn and inspired bomb builder.  An old film book of mine described Richard Todd as an ""energetic, if somewhat stiff"" British actor, which seems about right.  Similar British movies of that era, like `Sink the Bismarck,' didn't waste a lot of time away from the charts and maps, either.

 I'd never heard of this movie before, although I've watched an awful lot of war movies.  I found it through an internet search of Michael Redgrave movies.  As I write this it's available for rental but not purchase, unless you can find a used copy.  Weird.  If I had to hazard a guess why this good film is so buried and scarce nowadays I'd say it has to do with one of the movie's characters.  More specifically, with the character's name.  Todd's wing commander has a hyper-affectionate, coal black lab with an unfortunate name.  It begins with the letter `N,' is an ugly racial epithet that has been rightly banned from broadcast television since television began.  The dog is well-loved, everyone shouts his name in greeting when they see him, and he does get around.  It's tempting to make excuses for a 50-year-old movie, but even if this was the real name of a real dog it's real stupid and tone deaf to use it in a movie.",1152230400,2,3719,4.6810477657935285
1993300,4,B0001DYG1U,"Michael Anderson's ""The Dam Busters"" was a solid documentary style drama based on a true story regarding the revolutionary developement of a new form of wartime munitions.  The distinguished Sir Michael Redgrave plays Dr. Barnes Wallis, the progenator of a bomb that when launched at low altitude can skim along the surface of water.  This was specifically devised in order to breach a series of dams guarding the Ruhr valley in Germany's vitally important industrial heartland.

Redgrave's invention was initially scoffed at but through his persistence the military was finally convinced to institute a secret mission to utilize his deadly invention.

The spring of 1942 was the target date for the attack when the dams were at their fullest.  The 617th RAF Squadron lead by wing commander Guy Gibson played by Richard Todd commenced an arduous training regimen consisting of difficult low altitude flying.  Eventually the men were well schooled enough and the mission was carried out.

The grim determination of the men was in evidence as they attempted to take the battle to the Germans.  Dr. Wallis' invention proved itself to be invaluable in this film that depicted the intense struggle felt by all in Europe, especially in Britain, during the war.",1145232000,,1254,5.142857142857143

8011060,5,B0001DYG1U,"I loved it, but I must comment here in order to be honest about this: I had a friend at work who ordered a copy of this DVD & unfortunately, it turned out to be terrible in quality as some of the ""one-star"" reviewers say it is. So, what I did instead, was to order the ""Region 2"" (PAL) DVD from a source in England, & then have it converted to a region 1 by a local video store over here. That ""transfer"" (or conversion) worked out fine, although it cost me $25 to do so in addition to the original cost of the region 2 DVD to begin with. But, as it is one of the greatest classic films dealing with WWII exploits, it was still worth it to me to do this, inspite of the (then) cheesy ""special effects"" that were used when the film was produced in 1954.
