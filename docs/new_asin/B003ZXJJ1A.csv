4236716,1,B003ZXJJ1A,I love old movies.  This one was strange.,1414454400,,41,4.125
4236717,4,B003ZXJJ1A,"Good video and audio quality. Nice story line, if a bit predictable in a noir sorta way. Very nice acting, too. It's nice to see coppers and thugs acting so civil to one another, especially after the spate of US crime shows on TV in the 2010s. A five it ain't, but a 4 worth your time it is. And I enjoy seeing women play roles with real spunk, without resorting to being ""tough"".",1412812800,8,380,4.148648648648648
4236718,5,B003ZXJJ1A,"Genre: British-Noir Gritty

Pros:
-Noir-melodrama
-Acting is ok for the time (at least it wasn't bad)
-Script kept my interest
-Stuck with the Noir formula

Cons:
-Acting is ok (stronger cast could have made this awesome)
- sound was from that period
-lighting could use some work

As you can guess, I am a Noir fan.  I just pretended that British Gangsters talked like that and I was fine.  The main actor was stiff, but for some reason I didn't mind it (seen enough British film I guess).  Highly recommended (even the critics usually watch it for its Film History value).",1458000000,4,574,4.633663366336633

4236724,5,B003ZXJJ1A,"It is nice to see an older movie where the success of the show depended on the acting rather than bang-bang violence in every other scene, big explosions,  exposed bosoms and the other standard inclusions of modern potboiler offerings.",1428537600,5,235,5.0256410256410255

8411254,4,B003ZXJJ1A,"I never heard of this B thriller from 1946 England until I saw it at Amazon for a tempting prize.

Though stylistically not in the same class as say, Out Of The past, it is interesting enough if you collect noir DVDs.

A small time criminal has been conned into participating in a jewel robbery. He gets caught and is left behind to face the music. He serves his time not spilling out any beans. When released, he decides to get even with those who betrayed him. A simple enough plot, but this being England, there are some interesting details that would have never made it past the Breen Office in Hollywood: a few expletives that though tame by todays standards, were an absolute no-no in American movies then. Pushing the 1946 envelop further, there is a campy Gay character who seems to be the master criminals boy toy in residence. Absolutely verbotten in Hollywood (you have to really look hard to figure out the Gay character in Out Of The Past.

Another aspect that is different is the correct casting: don't expect a tough though sexy stud like Robert Mitchum in the lead. The leading character and those in the gang really look mean and are by no means glamorized.

The Blu-Ray is tack sharp though the photography lacks the dark shadows that one has come to assume in film noir. Mercifully, there are yellow English subtitles, with quite a number of misspellings (the person in charge of them was obviously listening to the soundtrack and not writing the dialogue from a script). Since this was a small B flick, there are no Extras.",1497052800,,1543,4.6
8411255,4,B003ZXJJ1A,A good English film noir. Worth a try.,1473724800,,38,3.875
8411256,3,B003ZXJJ1A,"Painfully hammy acting, with not a grotesque evil sneer or snarl or elongated eye-bulge ever missed.  Director was probably the criminal here.  Some delightful, unforgettable British pros among the wooden no-name leads, e.g., Wilfred Hyde-White as the floor waxer in the dancehall.  Reasonably intelligent script marred by jerky, cartoon-character population of this film's world.  Sorry it isn't better.",1470960000,2,404,5.913793103448276

8411260,4,B003ZXJJ1A,"Worth seeing. Rather bitter. This was 1946. Interestingly, ""bad"" words, seems like mostly ""hell,"" have been blanked out from the soundtrack in a very clumsy fashion that sometimes takes whole chunks of dialogue along. Wonder who did it and when? Enjoy!",1468627200,2,252,5.170731707317073

8411262,4,B003ZXJJ1A,"Recommended by MOMA Asst. Curator Dave Kehr as an overlooked gem, I found this quirky and one-of-a-kind noir to be a refreshing change from the 'venetian-blind' noirs made in America. Especially Herbert Lom as the crime boss/antique dealer. Though Billy Hartnell acquits himself handsomely and is reminiscent of Cagney in the '30s..",1466812800,3,332,5.403846153846154
