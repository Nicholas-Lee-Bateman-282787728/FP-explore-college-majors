1657932,5,B00005RYL6,"I thought this was a funny movie. It shows that Boy Scouts, or in this case Cub Scouts makes a difference in people's lives. All these men want to do is go back to their childhood lives and earn the most precident badge.  It gives hopes to the old ""foggy's"" of today's generation. Other  than the ""violence"" and some ""language"", this is a  great older family movie and for the Scouts.",963014400,3,384,4.380281690140845
1657933,5,B00005RYL6,"If you like comedies, you will love this! Louie Anderson is too funny, in fact the whole cast will crack you up! The casting of the particular actor/comedians for the various roles was perfect! A good comedy for the  whole family!",948844800,8,230,4.609756097560975
1657943,1,B00005RYL6,"Movie did great until scene selection 19. The picture froze. Couldn't get it to advance or reverse. I took it out and tried it in my other player, same thing. I then took it to my daughter's home and tried it there, same thing. I need to return it, but I have to go somewhere else and use someone's computer to do this. When I tried to do this from my home, the site said ""printer required"" and mine is not working. I bought several other movies and they all were good, so I am not unhappy with your service. I just hope the return goes well. I have several other purchases waiting in my cart that I will not buy until I see how this is resolved. Thank you.",1355184000,,657,4.061538461538461
1657944,5,B00005RYL6,"First saw this movie when my children were very young...my son loved it and always referred to it as ""The Cub Scout Movie.""  We had an old VHS copy for years, and finally found this one in DVD format---we simply HAD to have it.  This is a great movie for all Cub scouters (or former Cub scouts), Den leaders, mom's of cub scouts or girls who's brothers were Cub Scouts---it'll make ya laugh for sure!  The humor is silly, and clean, and reminds us all of goofy days from our youth.  The comic cast helps make this movie funny, and enjoyable, but Louie Anderson and Richard Lewis steal the show with hilarious one liners!  If you grew up during the late 50's or early 60's, you'll remember many things they do and say in this movie....but even if you grew up later, ""The Wrong Guys"" will send you laughing down memory lane!",1314489600,2,822,4.381578947368421
1657945,5,B00005RYL6,"Ok, this may be a few years old, but still funny.  It catches the comedians in their prime being who they are.  John Goodman adds his role perfectly.  I enjoyed it!",1278720000,,164,4.225806451612903
1657946,5,B00005RYL6,people who spend their time writing bad review for movies on amazon.com all day are losers. they should get laid. not that they would know how,1250208000,,142,4.5
1657947,2,B00005RYL6,"I recently purchased this movie because I remember watching it years ago when it first came out on VHS.  Had some of my favorite comedians in it.  I remembered it being hysterical but after viewing it recently, it didn't seem to have the comical effect of years gone by. Still a funny movie.",1219708800,,291,4.471698113207547
1657948,5,B00005RYL6,"Hi, movie fans! If you like movies, watch this hilarious comedy! It stars Louie Anderson (of TV's Family Feud), and is about 5 guys who were cub scouts as kids that meet again for the 1st time since then, and go on a camping trip, chased by two men who were cub scouts along with 'em who steal their engine and 1 thinks it is just SMALL!, 3 killers (the leader played by John Goodman) who think they are the FBI, and a SQUIRREL, with lots of laughs along the way. The 5 stars names in the movie are all the same as their names in real life, and these guys were not the wrong guys, but the RIGHT guys to make this film a GREAT comedy! Filmed in 1987 and released in early 1988, this movie was very underrated. It was poor at the box office, but is very rich with me! Get it! It'll be rich with you 2!",1026086400,4,799,3.968944099378882
1657949,5,B00005RYL6,"When I first sat in front of the Tv to watch this, it was on a cable station and I just happend upon it by mistake. However, it turned out it was far from a mistake!! If your looking for a good laugh and a good, clean fun movie, than this is what your looking for.  It's slapstick at it's best when these 5 friends reunite after years of seperation and pick up where they left off as kids.  AS they set off on their final camping trip to redeem their last chance for a cub scout badge they missed out on as kids, they run in to a wild ride as they encounter an escaped convict on their travels and they are mistaken for FBI agents on his pursuit and hijinks ensue.  The combination of comedic star power is wonderful....they compliment each other and feed off of one another to creat a hilarious movie.  Not everyone would agree with me but this has to be one of my top 10 all time favorites for comedy.",1017014400,6,903,4.113636363636363
1657950,5,B00005RYL6,"The Wrong Guys is just a fun movie.  If you like slapstick, wrye humor and an improbable plot, this movie is for you.  The cast of comics do their signature things and bring it all of seamlessly.  It is a humorous look at the journey from boyhood to adult and back again.",1013472000,7,271,4.173076923076923
1657951,1,B00005RYL6,"I find this film, right?  And I'm thinking, ""Hey!  Look at all the famous people in it!!  It's probably going to be really funny!""  After enduring this film, I'm left wondering ""What in the world was the director/scriptwriter/producer thinking?!?!?"".  Let me just give you the basic plotline here.  Grown men want to play cub scouts (You can see the obvious opportunity for gags and jokes here, folks.  Oh goodie!!).  The movie contains all your favorite hodge-podge of camp mishaps (ax head flies off, tent peg bends, cot snaps up on someone, etc.) made all the more mind-numbingly stupid by the fact that you know what's going to happen about 5 minutes before they actually do.  Combine that with the horrid ""acting"" abilities (I use the term loosely) of Louie Anderson (main character) and several ""I-wish-I-could-do-standup"" routines from Richard Lewis. Toss in a bad guy (John Goodman, the only redeeming performance in the movie) who can shoot a flagpole down at 300 yards, but can't hit ANY of seven (count them, seven) fully grown (and in Louie's case, fully overgrown) men floating on a raft not ten feet from him.  And what do you have? (...)
Save you money for something more worthwhile.  Like a pooper scooper.",1008201600,,1222,4.883495145631068
1657952,2,B00005RYL6,"I remember going to see this at the theater in 1988 when I was fourteen.  Besides my dad and me, there were only two other people in the theater.  They stood up and left halfway through.  There was a good reason for this. This movie is very poor and I believe it only stayed in theaters for about a week before tanking.  Good for nostalgia value only.",999734400,,351,4.1940298507462686

However, this was also the first movie I viewed through my PS4 via Amazon Primes streaming service.  The picture quality was horrible and I was disappointed with that.  That's the reason for the 3 stars.",1464739200,,292,4.37037037037037
