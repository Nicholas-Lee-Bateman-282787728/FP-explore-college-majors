1033024,3,630547253X,"I ALWAYS LIKED GEORGE ZUCCO,IN THESE QUICKIE LOW BUDGET B FLIXS. HE WAS A VERY GOOD ACTOR, BUT SOMEWHAT UNDERRATED BY THE STUDIOS, I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE TITLES WITHH HIM.",1161043200,3,174,4.645161290322581
1033025,4,630547253X,"This is really not a bad movie, it has several things going for it. It is short, like 58 minutes, which is a relief in this day of three and a half hour bore-a-thons. It has a good monster, the mindless killing machine Quetzalcoatl, who does nothing but kill, kill, kill and kill. And it has a sinister scientist as the bad guy who, of course, gets hoisted by his own pitard in the end. Oh yeah, it was shot in one of the most historic spots in the western hemisphere, San Juan county, New Mexico, home of the Anasazi culture and both Aztec Ruins National Monument and Chaco Canyon National Historic Site.

The 40's vintage special effect of the monster flying is much better than I expected, better than lots of the stuff from the 50's and even later, although it is obviously a puppet ""flying"" along on a string. And it's attack technique is suprisingly realistic and believable. And it's thirst for blood saved the producers from having to splash fake blood all over the place.

It falls down on a couple of points, the transfer ain't great and there never is any explaination as to why if ""Q"" is supposed to be guarding Montezuma's treasure why he is locked in a steel cage. And where did the cage come from in the first place. And how did he become so easily enlisted by Zucco's character and turned into a cut-rate hit man. Quetzalcoatl was, after all, supposed to be a God.

Don't forget to look at George Zucco's filmography, which is also on the DVD. This guy made lots of movies, most of which I haven't seen, yet.",1130112000,3,1524,4.4163701067615655
1033026,3,630547253X,"George Zucco is back in yet another PRC poverty row cheapie.  Zucco Stars as a nutty professor (no pun intended) Forbes  who discovers a hidden Aztec treasure as well as a prehistoric giant Bird.

Forbes then uses the feathers of the bird to kill those he thinks intends to steal his find.  The feathers are used as bait similar to what Lugosi did in another classic B film, The Devil Bat.

Zucco, of course, is quite wonderful, playing the wacked out professor with over the top zeal but no one else in the cast is worth mentioning.  The special effects our as bad as you could ever expect from a PRC film with the strings being quite visible when controlling the prehistoric bird.  On top of that the sets are cheap making this really one of the worst PRC movies which is quite an accomplishement

Still, being a Zucco fan I really enjoy him and the movie is worth watching to see him hamming it up.  Just don't go into it with any high expectations.",1099612800,2,952,4.394285714285714
1033027,4,630547253X,"George Zucco is the nefarious Dr. Forbes, archeologist. He's got Quetzalcoatl (yep, the aztec bird / lizard god) trapped in a cage in some old ruins. Forbes has found out that the creature will hunt down and kill anyone in possession of one of it's feathers (the first victim was the Dr.'s own wife). He uses the beast to knock off his enemies and protect the millions in aztec gold he's discovered. It's up to Forbes' step-daughter and a radio show host to stop the madness and mayhem. Yes, this is a remake of Bela's DEVIL BAT, with feathers instead of after-shave lotion, and Quetzalcoatl replacing the monstrous bat-mutant. TFS stands on it's own though, with plenty of fun and George Zucco's wide-eyed glare. A good, SHORT time-passer...",1093219200,2,742,4.8046875
1033028,4,630547253X,"George Zucco plays the villain in this little film.  The story is very similar to Lugosi Devil Bat but more rural.
Zucco has found a Quetzalcoatl and keeps it captive.  The serpent bird is very protective of its feathers.  Zucco collects them and gives them to those he has a grudge against.  The creature is then released which attacks the holder of the feather.  Of course good triumphs over evil as it usually does in these old films.
The effects of the creature and its flights are actually quite sophisticated.  Zucco does his usual good job as the villain and gets good support from the rest of the cast.
A fun old B-film that holds together well even after all these years.",1080086400,5,680,4.532786885245901
1033029,3,630547253X,A great classic PRC Pictures cheapie. The only drawback is the audio quality of the disc.,1035504000,,89,4.625
1033030,2,630547253X,"THE FLYING SERPENT has no aspirations of greatness. But it does have the coolly sinister George Zucco! A bargain-basement remake of another poverty row classic THE DEVIL BAT, this film passes the hour (running time: 59  minutes) serving up mild amusement. Zucco pretends to be innocent, but we  all know (and so should everyone else in the movie) that he's behind the  strange killings that are always preceded by the discovery of an unusual  feather. Zucco's (admittedly average) performance really is the only thing  that makes it worth a view.
As a lover of old low budget horror films, I  give this one a ""weak but fun"". I'd recommend a rent instead of a  buy, though, because the DVD is not a good value for the money. The picture  quality is decent but the source material's quality is not very good. There  are no significant extras included. It's only an hour long. Add those facts  to a too-high list price, and you're best advised to buy it only if you  KNOW you must have it.",950054400,17,986,4.577142857142857
1033146,2,630547253X,"Have to confess, I only watched a few minutes of it before turning it off. The ""serpent"" was more like an oversized pheasant and if I was attacked by it, I wouldn't be worried.",1477094400,,176,4.205882352941177

1033149,2,630547253X,"The blurb describes this as a ""campy"" movie.  Cheesy is more accurate.

1033280,4,630547253X,George Zucco excels as usual despite a non-existent budget. His fans need this one because he overcomes probably the worst production he ever had to deal with. The monster is not very well made but it is a relentlessly vicious little beast. I enjoyed the scenes of Zucco talking to it in the dark catacombs.,1433894400,,307,4.6
1033281,4,630547253X,Zucco excels as usual despite a non-existent budget. Zucco fans need this one because he overcomes probably the worst production he ever had to deal with- but of course he is watchable as always.

Appreciation of this type of movie is a guilty pleasure - don't watch this if your idea of a good movie is decent acting, special effects, storyline, believability etc. It is because of the lack of these qualities that make the movie enjoyable - at least for me.",1429488000,2,395,4.424657534246576

1033286,3,630547253X,"The film is an early science fiction one with a mythical monster come alive
and being directed by a evil genius to murder people.
There is no secret who he is from the very first!
A romance between a 40's radio detective and the daughter of the villain
is the side light of the story.
How the mystery of the vampire flying serpent is solved is worth watching.
I liked the film and it is actually somewhat better in quality than most
of the similar films of the time.",1229212800,,466,4.247191011235955
1033287,4,630547253X,"This is fun little movie about a killer bird lizard. The monster for its time is ok, a little on the small side. This doesn't have a complex story or anything to really confuse you in its 1 hour run. Goerge Zucco summons Quetzalcoatl, Q the Flying Serpent (an Aztec Bird) to do its murdering for his own selfish reasons - to protect a treasure he found. George plants the monsters feathers on his victims. I think its a good way to spend an hour if you want to watch a fun/cheesy old movie. Dont expect Earth shattering SPFX :) If you liked the Devil Bat, and The Human Monster, this should also be something you might want to see The remake called Q the Winged Serpent is also worth seeing, a bit gorier.",1228089600,,705,4.268656716417911

A professor discovers Aztec gold and feathers his nest.

As usual no serpent, flying or otherwise can upstage George Zucco.
The film is a tad dark and seems to be of a much earlier filming era.
Filmed in a popular location known as Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park.",1513641600,,491,4.326086956521739

7889770,4,630547253X,"Not bad mid-40's B-quality horror film.  A strange flying creature is killing assorted people in the New Mexico countryside.  George Zucco plays a cracked archaeologist who has discovered the animal and is putting it through its paces; doing away with his enemies.  It seems anytime Zucco plants one of the animal's feathers on a potential victim the bird comes to retrieve its plumage (it's vain) and kill the feather holder.  The beast is a bird/reptile conglomeration called a Quetzalcoatl.  Sort of a modern-day prehistoric archaeopteryx.  A radio detective makes it his mission to solve the goings-on.  Being a P.R.C. creation the production values are not the best and the film needs re-mastering, but the Image Entertainment DVD is probably the best version available at this time.
