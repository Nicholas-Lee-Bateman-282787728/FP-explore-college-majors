4082593,3,B0037Z963C,"Brooding and atmospheric, CRY OF THE OWL is a complex and interesting psycho-thriller.  Bizarre coincidences set up Paddy Considine's fall into a murder scenario involving a somewhat wacko played by Julia Stiles.  Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, OWL is slow-paced but involving.  But when we find out the who, we don't find out why or how those involved crossed path.
It is this plot twist that left me dissatisfied.
OWL is well crafted but left me wanting more.",1301788800,6,467,4.961538461538462
4082594,3,B0037Z963C,"The novels of Patricia Highsmith have been turned often into cinema with varying degrees of success:  ""Strangers on a Train""; ""Purple Noon""; ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".  So I was intrigued by this, a Highsmith story with which I was not familiar.  The two lead actors, Paddy Considine & Julia Stiles, share a ""Bourne"" connection:  Julia of course, played 'Nicky' in all three Bourne movies, Considine's best-known role is probably that of the tabloid journalist that gets gunned down in a London train station in an early setpiece in ""Bourne Ultimatum"".  Here, Considine regrettably quashes his native English accent as Robert Forrester, a man who has just gone through a bitter divorce & moves to a small, unnamed town & takes a new job to get away from associations of his ex-wife.  Though the nondescript locations are meant to suggest the Midwest (Highsmith set it in Pennsylvania), one can tell by the accents of the supporting actors that it was actually filmed in Canada.

Robert is deeply unhappy & emotionally fragile . . .just prior to the divorce, he'd had a pretty bad mental breakdown, and now he's living alone in a tiny rented house in Nowheresville.  On his drive home from work, he comes across Jenny's (Julia Stiles) house, set in a rather remote rural area, and is drawn by the lights on in her rooms & the pretty picture of happy domesticity she presents as she goes about her homely tasks: cooking, having dinner with her boyfriend.  Robert is a nightly visitor to Jenny's, and although his motives are not sinister, try explaining that to the young woman when she catches him prying.  Despite this unpromising meeting, the two feel a kinship with one another from the start.  Jenny is lonely, too, in a smothering relationship with a violent man and as is revealed gradually bit by bit, emotionally fragile herself.  In fact, her emotional clinginess soon feels to Robert like stalking, somewhat turning the tables on him.  Is the angelic-looking Jenny his Angel of Mercy or a bad omen?  As misfortunes begin to pile up, and the hapless yet innocent Robert is in precisely the right place at the wrong time to appear responsible for a string of mysterious deaths, we begin to wonder.

Despite a promising premise, this movie never quite realized its potential.  Both lead actors have been far more dynamic in other roles.  Considine's nervous, sad-sack low affect is appropriate to his shell-shocked character, but Stiles is almost a nonentity as Jenny, lacking in visual or dynamic energy.  Maybe the dreary weather was getting to the actors .. the unrelenting gray palette and monotone line readings certainly got to me.  Caroline Dhavernas provides a dash of color as Robert's sadistic ex-wife (ironically named 'Nicky').  The ending is unexpected, which is saying something for a movie that barely held my interest in the getting there.  Having not read the Highsmith novel of the same name, I can't say whether it is a faithful adaptation, but it's a bit of a miss.",1292716800,10,2991,4.883168316831683
4082595,4,B0037Z963C,"The previews of this movie looked really suspenseful. I like Julia Stiles' acting. Although I enjoyed this movie, at the end I just said ""Huh?"".",1289260800,5,144,4.8
4082596,4,B0037Z963C,"You can tell this is a Canadian-made movie, even apart from the skyline shot of Toronto and the nationality of the actors. You can tell it's Canadian by the almost modest, unassuming way in which the murder unfolds.

Then too, any murder or murder plot is almost secondary in the film. This is more a visual essay about coming to a crossroads, about the fatefulness of going in one direction rather than the other. It's about how we start out taking in life from one perspective, then end up starring back at that person we used to be.

There are several of these telling reversals in the film. The man who starts out being a sort of harmless stalker ends up being harmlessly stalked. The watcher ends up being watched.

This film might almost be a bit too low-key for many American audiences, and Paddy Considine, the lead actor, might come across as being almost too unprepossessing and inarticulate. But ""Cry of the Owl"" leaves a wistful trace of wondering in the air. It's like the faint and elusive scent of violets. We can't be quite sure where it's coming from or what it means. However it touches us somehow and wafts into our memories.

The script for this movie was based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the same author who wrote ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" chronicle. There's no commentary on the DVD.",1281916800,13,1312,4.594017094017094

4082598,1,B0037Z963C,"The movie starts painfully slow, and never moves beyond a snails pace.  I kept watching in anticipation of a twist, but it never happened. Definitely nothing exciting or interesting about this movie.",1278115200,7,199,5.21875
4082599,4,B0037Z963C,"The Cry of the Owl is a slow-boiling psychological thriller that doesn't offer the nonstop suspense that ""Seven"" might, but still delivers by the film's end.

The movie is based on a 1962 novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the novel that ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" film was based on.  Cry of the Owl was eventually shot as a movie in 1987 by a French director, and was finally re-shot in Canada in 2009.  What stands out about this version is the cast, which includes Julia Stiles and British actor Paddy Considine.

I've long been a fan of Considine, and he plays the neurotic Robert Forrester brilliantly.  I've seen Considine in a number of roles where he plays an assertive character, so it's interesting to see him as a shell of a man and something of a coward.  This was also my first introduction to the stunningly beautiful Caroline Dhavernas, who plays Forrester's sadistic ex-wife.

The plot overview for this movie by Amazon is a bit sensational, particularly in which character is ultimately labeled a stalker.  The film starts quite slow, but eventually pulls you in with the bizarre psychological problems most of the major characters seem to deal with.  It's not until the second half of the film that the story picks up steam, and you're thrown unpredictable moments and twists along the way.  There's a great deal of foreshadowing used in the movie, which seems appropriate considering the superstitions surrounding owls.

Cry of the Owl is not ""Silence of the Lambs"", so if you're looking for a constant thrills with a crystal-clear ending, this isn't it.  I found it to be intriguing and suspenseful, with dark psychological undertones as the film hit its stride.  While the conclusion isn't open-ended, it allows the audience to make their own interpretation of the story and the true significance of its characters.

My guess is that people will either love or hate this film, depending on their appeal to film noir.  I thought it was a step above your average Redbox rental, and I think anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers should watch it at least once.",1276128000,42,2089,4.845070422535211
4082600,4,B0037Z963C,"For full disclosure, I did not see the first 10 minutes of this film.  I am going to watch the beginning in the next week to see what I missed, as I feel that there is something there that is important to the film at a later point.

However, I really liked this film, surely better than the rest of the crowd.  Maybe it's more like a 3.5, but I'll round up as it was a pleasant surprise.  I liked the mood of this film; very understated.  And the music is surely not overpowering.  During one scene I consciously thought about it, thought about the audio track in the background, and how there was very little music.  If this is correct, big bonus there.  I hate it when a director, during post-production work, tries to manipulate my emotions with music and I believe that this director did not make this mistake.

One issue that I did have (it may be cleared up after catching the first 10 minutes for me later):  Julia Stiles, who I think does some very nice work here, does something late in the second act (or early in the third) that didn't make much sense to me.  I won't tell you what that is, but I thought, ""Huh?  Why?"" and I still don't really get it.  It seemed pointless to me, other than possibly to help support a possible theme, discussed next.

Now, what is the theme?  During the movie they even say something like, ""An owl's cry is the symbol of death"" or something like that.  But I felt that the theme was perhaps, ""Some people are just cursed, and bad things just follow them.""  (From what I remember, the main character says something to a coworker at one point that supports this idea.)

Slightly more than a mild recommendation here.",1350864000,2,1658,4.362745098039215

4082602,4,B0037Z963C,"The flick moves at a surprising, if improbable, pace.  Stiles and Considine give their characters realistic passion, albeit generally unrequited.  But this movie seems to be about four individuals: two of them a touch naive and vulnerable; two decidedly vindictive and often malicious, and all of them about a half a bubble out of plumb and suffering from one obsession or another.

Stiles does everything your mom told you not to do - talking to strangers, allowing them into your home, etc., and Considine reciprocates by being a nave, if obsessed, stalker who just turns out to be a inoffensive, introspective guy going through a spiteful divorce while trying to manage turmoil in his career and trying to comprehend his own uneasy fixation with  Styles -- and  only a vague grasp of how to cope with it all.

It all gets truly out of hand when Stiles' Ex decides to fake his own death to implicate Considine, and from there the plot has about as many twists and turns as a corkscrew dropped down a garbage disposal.  Regrettably some of the plot is not fully developed - notably, the import of the Owl.  So the viewer is left to wonder how the liaison between the two Ex's came about, and how Stile's character suddenly arises in the middle of the night and gratuitously checks out permanently.

Admirable acting nonetheless, and an entertaining, if disjointed, plot, all rolled together in a production that makes me wonder if they didn't leave part of it in the cutting room.",1343692800,,1481,4.75390625
4082603,2,B0037Z963C,"I have to admit that I am a fan of the source novel by Patricia Highsmith.  I have read the novel three times already in my life and I am sure I will again at some point.  I think it's a brilliant story.

Almost everything that is good about the book gets lost in the  translation to film here.

I don't think this is the kind of story that can work as a film.  The plot has some cool twists that work on film but only if you are invested in the characters.

Since you can't actually see the film from Robert's odd viewpoint as translated through his narration in the book you can't really understand his motivations.  HE comes across as a weird creep in the film, and so does Jenny (although Julia Stiles did her best with what she had to work with.

Highsmith was a brilliant author but dialogue was always one of her weak spots.  Her novels were not very easy to turn into films, I feel that this fails no worse than the Talented Mr. Ripley, that film was only saved by a showstopping performance by Matt Damon.

Cry of the Owl only has bland performances outside of Caroline Dhavernas who is perfect as Robert's evil ex-wife Nikki.  If only some of her nude scenes from the novel had been used in the film.

Not worth watching unless you are a hardcore Patricia Highsmith fan and feel like you need to see every movie that was made of her books.  You are much better off watching the french version of this which was directed by Claude Chabrol.

It stands alone on its own as a good film and is the better of the two adaptations.",1330300800,2,1533,4.2379310344827585
4082604,1,B0037Z963C,"I get what the premise of this movie was..be careful what you wish for, you don't know what is going on with a person until you step in their shoes, don's stalk someone- yadda yadda yadda.

I just kept saying ""huh?"" throughout the whole movie. I am not someone who psychoanalyzes movies, characters etc. but I had real trouble figuring out everyone's motivation in this movie. I got why the main guy stalked Julia Stiles. What I didn't get was her openness to it, or why she fell in love with him or why she committed suicide. Even her suicide note made no sense. Her character just drifted through the movie with no real substance.

I didn't get why his ex-wife hated him so much and why she went through all this trouble to ruin his life.

I didn't get why Julia's ex-boyfriend got knocked out in every scene, did he have a neurological condition where every time someone punched him he got knocked out cold. I didn't get why if he loved Julia Stile's character so much why he didn't seem to be grieving that she had taken her own life. I didn't get how he went from sad ex-boyfriend to this petulant, annoying, psycho-killer.

I didn't get the purpose of the man with the three legged dog who winds up with a bullet in his head. I worried about who was going to take care of poor ole three legged Fido than I did with any of the humans in this film.

This movie dragged for me and I just wanted it to be over. I will admit that I liked the final scene where he is finally on the inside of where he he wanted to be only it wasn't as fulfilling as he thought it would be. But I got tired of this born loser who just seems to have a black cloud over his head where everyone seems to end up dead around him.",1330128000,,1706,4.173252279635259

4082607,3,B0037Z963C,"The Cry of the Owl is an understated suspense about one man overcoming his past troubles. Robert Forrester (Paddy Considine) escapes to the woods and spies on a young woman as a sort of therapy for his depression from his past divorce. To see Jenny (Julia Stiles) doing common things in a content way gives Robert a sort of hope. However, when Jenny spots Robert hiding out on one occasion, his motives for being out there are questioned. When Jenny's jealous boyfriend suddenly goes missing after a confrontation with Robert, then Robert becomes a suspect. It doesn't help that Robert, coming off a breakdown, is anxious, nervous and socially awkward.

A Cry of the Owl is one of those films that leads you one direction only to take you a direction that didn't even seem a possibility. The film is more of a study of fatalism than the intense thriller it is billed as, and I actually laud the director for leaving the ending somewhat open ended. By film's end, you understand that there is a great deal of symbolism for various things (the owl, Robert, the woods). There's an overwhelming sense of inevitability within the character of Robert Forrester that some characters just can't escape.

What hurts the film most is lost opportunities. Moments for decidedly compelling dialogue were there (Robert sensing a little unstableness in Jenny's character, Robert confronting his wife, etc), but often these moments fell flat.  Often in the film, you anticipate a gripping moment, only to have a character hesitate to say anything or stop short, and then...silence. Another problematic aspect is the aloofness of virtually every character.  Sure, it is an understated kind of film, but the distance really alienates the viewer into not caring one way or another about these characters or their circumstances. Not only that, but the film just feels a little off, as if the timing and dialogue were out of whack.

The Cry of the Owl tries to be anything but conventional, which is good, but it still could have been a much better film.",1309478400,3,2033,4.864161849710983

4082609,4,B0037Z963C,"THE CRY OF THE OWL is a tense, somewhat disjointed story with Kafkaesque overtones ('marked by surreal distortion and a sense of impending danger'):  had the film been distributed with the information that it taken from a 1962 novel by Patricia Highsmith ('Strangers on a Train', 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and the follow-up novels with that character, etc) it would have likely garnered a larger audience.  It is a strange psychological thriller  that slowly works its way under the viewer's skin. The screenplay was written by director Jamie Thaves who successfully captures Highsmith's extraordinary story.

Robert Forrester (Paddy Considine) is a troubled, depressed but decent young man who retreats from the big city and his ex-wife for the tranquility of a small town in Pennsylvania. For some not obvious reason he begins to night stalk a young woman Jenny Thierolf (Julia Stiles), gazing in the dark at the apparently happy Jenny alone in her secluded house.  Jenny inadvertently befriends Robert despite the fact that Jenny is in a relationship with Greg Wyncoop (James Gilbert): Greg confronts Robert, a fight ensues and Robert flees after saving Greg from drowning in the river. In a twist of circumstances Jenny begins to stalk Robert, admitting that she has fallen in love with him, but Robert avoids her advances as he is still in the process of an ugly divorce with his wife Nickie (Caroline Dhavernas), a strange behaving woman who feeds on Robert's lack of self worth. When Greg goes missing Robert becomes the prime suspect. With the police on his case the 'crime' becomes threatening, and in typical Highsmith fashion, everything twists and turns at the end, creating a claustrophobic and irrational series of events until the story ends with some questions answered and others left hanging.

The actors are excellent and the cinematography by Luc Montpellier adds to the haunting creepiness of the film.  Jeff Daniels' minimal music score underlines the tension.  Before watching this film, remind your self that you are dealing with Patricia Highsmith's brand of mystery and the film will be more appreciated.

I had paid for a Clark Bar that simply wouldn't vend, not because I like Clark Bars, but the boring nature of the plain red wrapper it comes in and the stupid name of it was what attracted me.

I tried with the Might of a thousand detonating Suns to get it out but to no avail. I hurt my arm in the process and began bawling like a little baby.

 Some lady in a raincoat grabbed me by the back of the head and yelled ""I'll give you something to cry about"" and just when I was expected her to smash me in the kidneys with a clawhammer she handed me a copy of ""The Cry of The Owl"" upon the dvd format.

After having someone call 911 for me and spending roughly $5000 that I didn't have to get myself out of the aforementioned ordeal, I took my throbbing, injured arm home and watched ""The Cry Of The Owl"" on dvd.

 It was creepy, it was different, it ruled.
 I watched, I cheered, I rejoiced. I discarded a series of Crispy M&M wrappers about my room, a few coming to rest near the heating vent in the floor.

8390899,4,B0037Z963C,"""The Cry of the Owl"" is a 2009 Canadian psychological-drama with thriller elements based on the Patricia Highsmith novel. The story revolves around Robert Forrester (Paddy Considine) who has a great job, but is in the process of a divorce and has recently moved out of the big city. He becomes intrigued by a random girl he spots at a country house and secretly gazes at her from the woods at night. A relationship eventually develops and the girl, Jenny (Julia Stiles), starts overly-monitoring him and he begins to regret the relationship. Meanwhile, Jenny's ex (James Gilbert) isn't happy about the situation and neither is Robert's ex (Caroline Dhavernas). The situation soon spirals out of control.

The story is fairly engaging and the actors are effective, particularly Considine as the protagonist, but the ending is ambiguous and left to interpretation. Regardless, the themes are intriguing: romanticism vs. logic, fate and fatalism vs. chance encounter, omens and signs vs. random happenings and the irony of role reversal or reaping what you sow.

It's not great and it's too pessimistic -- probably because it's really a tragedy -- but it's a solid psycho-drama with intriguing ideas that'll leave you pondering or scratching your head. The latter is why many people don't like it.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Ontario.
