His voice is not dubbed in the Father Matteo series.  The times that his voice was dubbed was when his American movies, in english, were shown in Italy.  If you watch some of his first American movies you will hear his Italian accent which he eventually lost.  I love the Don Matteo series and I watch it on TV as often as I can.  I would like to own the whole series.  I am working on that.",1418169600,2,537,4.165048543689321
