7865928,4,6304219040,"This is a TV film (3 hours in all) made in 1995 starring Armand Assante and Brian McCardie, based on RL Stevenson's classic adventure novel.  You can also see the veterans like Brendan Gleeson ('28 Days Later') and David Kelly (Waking Ned').

The original story is changed not by cutting short the book, but rather adding extra materials to it, mainly about the background of Alan Breck Stewart (played by Armande Assante, replacing Christopher Reeve who met the accident while riding a horse).  The film starts with some episodes about Alan, political refuge in Scotland, brave, dashing and charming fighter for the cause.

Then we see the book's hero David Balfore (Brian McCardie, one of the hapless guys in silly actioner 'Speed 2').  As you see David traveling to his uncle's in Scotland, you know this idealistic young man who lacks the worldly knowledge is going to have some troubles, like being 'kidnapped' by the sailors.  When Alan accidentally crosses the path of David, it is the beginning of the adventure story of the two, who come to realize that they must rely on each other to survive.

Now the original story is changed to give a stress upon 'the bad and the good,' so the historical event (The Appin Murder') upon which Stevenson created part of his world sits slightly uncomfortable beside the simplified characters.  The film tries to merge the historical aspects of the Jacobites into the actions, but not everything succeeds, making the story of David less memorable than the original.  After all, you know it's his story, not Alan's, if you read the book, and the viewers might forget that 'Kidnapped' refers to David's experience.

Shot in beautiful ... Ireland (!) -- yes, not Scotland, but still beautiful -- the film needs perhaps some more  trimming.  Still, it stands on its own as pretty entertaining film if you don't care the addtitional episodes that Stevenson perhaps have some tough time to accept as his own.",1102550400,3,1946,4.88145896656535
7865929,3,6304219040,"I was excited to see another version of Kidnapped on VHS, having only seen the Disney version.  Off to a good start, it quickly lost my interest as it took too many liberties with the book and made Alan Breck into a Superman character, taking on an army of British soldiers with his courage, wit, and strength. Once it crossed the line into the unbelievable I was lost and up getting a glass of tea and taking a potty break.  The characters were weakly developed, as was the friendship between Alan and David. The Disney version lacked a lot of the cinematography, but was much better in developing the plot and characters. This is good for action, but weak otherwise. My advice is to read the book, and if you want a movie get the Disney classic.",1044662400,2,747,4.445255474452555
