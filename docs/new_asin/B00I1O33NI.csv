I still have the VHS versions of the old tapes at my parents' house in SC.  Now that I live out of state and The Firm was bought by Gaim, one of the founders passed and GAIM started doing gimmicky videos I visited other series but I realized that The Firm is the one that gets you in shape the fastest. The old school series (back when they had the artsy set and was wearing leg warmers are the best!). Scrolling through Prime videos this morning and I didn't realize that they had fitness videos and came across Tracie...YAAAAAY! I just finished this workout and I feel great.

If you are familiar with The FIRM moves then this workout will feel familiar but if you aren't then I suggest you watch it first then try it.",1532217600,,858,4.316770186335404

8638242,4,B00I1O33NI,Great workout.  Tracie is always great at cueing which was good because the feed from Amazon was off.,1493164800,2,101,4.611111111111111
8638243,5,B00I1O33NI,"I'm an avid exerciser. This was my first Tracie Long video and I Ioved it!!! She has great cueing, gives you suggestions for modifications if needed. It doesn't have complicated choreography or lots of twisting and turning or jumping. Thats important for me since I work out on carpet. It's great on your joints since you are not jumping. It's a very effective low impact workout with tons of strengthening, lengthening,lunges, squats, some standing Pilates inspired moves, balancing, lateral bends, some extension exercise. You will need some hand weights, I use 5 and 8 pounds. We are around the same age late 40's early 50's, so she motivates me more than the 20 something year old instructors. I will definitely buy more of her videos. Challenging total body workout! I highly recommend.",1475193600,8,791,5.0
8638244,5,B00I1O33NI,"Tough but great workout. This workout is great! Tracie is a veteran instructor with excellent cuing and form, she is always on point. This workout has different segments. The first part is a flow of several sequences using hand weights and multi muscle moves to work muscle and heart conditioning, like squats with over heard presses. Then you do a series of balance movements which are very nice and allow a cool down before moving on to mat work for the hips, abs, and core. Tracie is pleasant but no nonsense, and the production quality is excellent. This is my 2nd one of the Longevity series and I really like them, so much so I bought 5 of the 6. They make a well rounded series with a blend of cardio, toning, step, functional moves, floor work, and all in a moderate to advanced level and all clocking in at 50 minutes. One thing to be aware of that was a a surprise to me is that the DVD ads can make it sound like there are ""bonus"" workouts on the DVD but the mini workouts are just premises of the different segments in the DVD so you can do a part of the workout. I misunderstood the ad so that was a disappointing surprise so FYI.",1435190400,13,1143,4.271889400921659
8638245,5,B00I1O33NI,"I have been doing the Firm workouts for many years and have always loved Tracie Long's tortoise and hare. I was looking for more of her workouts and found this- what a wonderful workout!! Great strengthening, toning and balanced workout. And it's 45 min, so you can fit it into your busy day. Tracie Long is wonderful!!",1414627200,7,319,4.614035087719298
