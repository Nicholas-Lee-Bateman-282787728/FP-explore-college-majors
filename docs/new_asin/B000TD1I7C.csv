8208616,5,B000TD1I7C,I've been fortunate to take lessons from Bill Evans in person at the Midwest Banjo Camp; he is an excellent teacher in person and that comes across in the DVD lessons as well. He breaks down those licks I've been hearing but couldn't quite figure out so they are easy to understand and learn to play. I will definitely be buying more of Bill's DVDs.,1402444800,,349,4.384615384615385
8208617,4,B000TD1I7C,"I've been playing for several years and this is a book that shows you some very valuable up-the-neck licks that will enhance your backup playing.  He offers both right and left hand shots while demonstrating them.  The only suggestion I have would be for him to provide a screen shot of the tablature so you can pause it and study it a little before trying to attempt it.  If you don't have some play by ear skill, it may be a little more challenging. I'd recommend the DVD though.  Look forward to Volume II.",1236556800,,509,4.382978723404255
