8250462,1,B0013EF3WM,I would bet this terrible quality DVD was copied from a VCR. There is chinese writing all over the cover and for subtitles. The scenes are darker than even the VCR tape that I have.  And very poor subtitles since what is said in the movie and what appears on the screen are not the same.  I would not trust or buy from this seller again or any other that are not US issued.,1289606400,8,373,4.027027027027027

8250464,5,B0013EF3WM,"This 1977 release of The Man in the Iron Mask is excellent, and my favorite film of this story.  It stars Richard Chamberlain, Patrick McGoohan, Louis Jourdan and Jenny Agutter.  This import relase by Castaway Pictures has good quality picture and sound.  The English subtitles are good for a laugh, at times not even approaching what the actors are saying. There should be a website devoted to bad subtitles!  Apart from that, you can buy this disc with confidence.",1247443200,2,466,4.860759493670886
8250465,4,B0013EF3WM,This version is a good look at the author's view  of his hero. Richard Chamberlain does a very good job making this a very viewable and enjoyable version of the classisc story.,1241395200,,176,4.5
8250466,5,B0013EF3WM,"This film is the best version I have yet seen of the Man in the Iron Mask, the later Hollywood version does not compare, as this film is superior in both acting, choreography and script. Richard Chamberlain does a marvelous job in the lead role, one is convinced that he is the Man in the Iron Mask, and one cannot but empathize afterward. This is a must see version, as the viewer will not be disappointed.",1217548800,3,407,4.368421052631579
