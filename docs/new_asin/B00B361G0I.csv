8561942,4,B00B361G0I,"WWE for the past couple of years has been quietly releasing double packs of DVD's together that had a common theme to them & in this case, it's ""The Phenom"" for over 20 years in The Undertaker.

He Buries Them Alive:
This is an old Coliseum Video tape that WWE quietly released onto DVD a while back featuring matches from the Undertaker in the fall in 1994 with the tape hosted by ""Million $ Man"" Ted Dibiase.

vs. Undertaker - This was the return of the REAL Undertaker to the WWF after losing his casket match to Yokozuna at the Royal Rumble earlier in the year along with the debut of his purple look. While Undertaker was gone, Ted Dibiase brought along another man that everyone assumed was Undertaker (played by Brian Lee...better known as Chainz of the group ""D.O.A."" later on in WWE), except Paul Bearer, leading to this clash. The match itself wasn't much past brawling in the ring & around ringside with only the only highlights being the real Undertaker being able to counter all of the ""trademark"" moves done by the impostor only to do them himself, such as what we now know as ""Old School"" before ending the match with 3 tombstones.
SummerSlam '94

vs. Kwang - Although Kwang was able to get a few shots here & there, this was all Undertaker to the point where Kwang used the mist on Taker only for Taker to throw it right back in his face.
[Best Of RAW: Seasons 1 & 2]

Casket Match vs. Yokozuna - Unlike their Royal Rumble match where it was just putting over a storyline, this was an actual match between the two. They had actor/martial artist Chuck Norris at ringside to prevent others from interfering like what happened at the Rumble but he didn't really do anything past kicking Jeff Jarrett in the chin. The match went well as Undertaker can bring out the best of the biggest men in this sport & this match was no exception. It's not a wrestling classic but it a good match to watch.
Survivor Series '94

vs. Jim Niedhart - Owen Hart was at ringside for this match & was mostly dominate by Undertaker with Jim Niedhart able to get some impactful moves of his own such as a clothesline & powerslam & suplex only for Taker to keep getting up. Paul Bearer brought the casket to ringside only for Anvil to fall into it & be completely creeped out to the point where he & Owen forgot about the match and just wanted to get away.

Casket Match vs. Jerry Lawler - We got an exclusive match for this tape with it being an extra special treat in being a casket match. This was back when Jerry Lawler was the cowardly heel as he constantly kept trying to avoid Taker & had to constantly cheat in order to get an advantage which we saw here as he resorted to low blows & punches with objects in his hands but that was only temporary as this for the most part was another dominate victory by Undertaker.

Undertaker's Deadliest Matches:
This was a nice setup where it showcased most of the ""gimmick"" matches he's been involved in (Steel Cage, First Blood, Last Man Standing) along with the ones he was the innovator of (Body Bag, Coffin/Casket, Boiler Room Brawl, Buried Alive, Inferno, Hell In A Cell, Last Ride). Now while you don't hear Undertaker break character or really talk about his feuds going into these matches, he does do voiceovers here before each match.

Body Bag Match vs. Ultimate Warrior - This was a rare televised house show match & the first (of many) gimmick matches revolving around Undertaker's persona. The object of this match was to knock your opposition out long enough to place them inside of a body bag & zip it up to win. As usual when it came to Ultimate Warrior, he started out with a fast pace before Taker slowed it down by choking Warrior down to the ground. Warrior still brought the fight & ended up delivering 3 consistent piledrivers with Taker getting up from each one before having to resort to knocking him out with the urn to win the match.
""MSG"" July '91

Coffin Match vs. Kamala - This was the first ever coffin match (later renamed Casket Match) with the rules being a little different than we know then now as you had to win a fall before putting your opponent in the coffin. This match itself was pretty short & sweet (a little over 5 mins.) just to finish the feud between Taker & Kamala but only important as this was the first of many casket matches.
Survivor Series '92

Casket Match vs. Kama - Throughout 1995, Undertaker had been feuding with Ted Dibiase's ""Million $ Corporation"" from I.R.S. (Royal Rumble) to King Kong Bundy (WrestleMania) with Kama being the next person in line after stealing Taker's urn & melting it down into a gold chain. Taker manhandled Kama early both physically as well as mentally with the casket as he kept trying to avoid & run away from it. Kama was able to take control with various punches & kicks along with other moves like a clothesline from the top rope while both men pulled off some spots with the casket that we hadn't seen before. In the end, it still wasn't enough for Taker to still get his revenge but one moment I have to point out during this match that was almost comedic is look out for when Paul Bearer wanted to fight Ted Dibiase on the outside to the point where he even took his coat off, I couldn't help but laugh at that.
SummerSlam '95

Casket Match vs. King Mabel - Undertaker was once again out for revenge here against Mabel who had done so many things to Undertaker such as being one of the rare people to pin him, injure him (hence why he was wearing a face mask during this match), get control of Kama's chain made from Taker's urn, and even go as far as spray painting his own casket. While Mabel was able to get in a few shots here & there, this was a dominate performance by Undertaker to the point where not only did he put Mabel in the casket & got his chain match but got his hands on Sir Mo as well.
""In Your House"" Dec. '95

vs. Mankind - Mankind had attacked Undertaker for months, starting on the RAW right after WrestleMania, and was able to constantly render him unconscious with the nerve hold of the mandible claw. so Taker was more hellbent on revenge than we've seen him before which played out right from the start as Taker attacked Mankind from behind before taking it into the ring & punching him down with more fury than ever before. This evolved into a slow paced brawl with Taker even going for Mankind's mask at one point before Mankind was able to recover & deliver punishment of his own like a running knee smashing Taker's face between his knee & the steel steps before Taker was able to retaliate with an unprotected chairshot right to the head. Before this point in Taker's career, a majority of his matches were against bigger men who were very limited in what they can do in the ring but then came Mankind who definitely brought a more ""hardcore"" fight & style where he used his own body as a weapon which made one line Jim Ross said summarize this match perfectly, ""THIS IS WARFARE!"" as this was most intense & physical match in Taker's career up to this point.
King Of The Ring '96

Boiler Room Brawl vs. Mankind - This was another match that Taker became an innovator of as the rules for this match was that both men would start in the match in the boiler room of the arena with the objective being to fight out & make their way to the ring where the winner would be the man who takes possession of the urn that Paul Bearer was holding in the ring. Mick Foley would later go on refer to this match as his ""unloved child"" because it was a concept that was so unique & different. The fighting in the boiler room was filmed with just one camera & no extra lighting to give it a ""gritty"" feel while there was mostly no commentary minus a few lines here & there while there were some technical difficulties with the picture going out a few times. These men just beat on each other with whatever they could get their hands on while putting themselves in danger like Mankind falling off a ladder through some pieces of wood on top of a box. They were able to make their way out of the boiler room & through the backstage area of the locker room & hallway (including Taker getting burned with hot coffee) all the way to the ring where the bigger story happened in that destroyed an almost 6 year bond. Although Taker & Mankind have had a series of matches you can classify as ""hardcore"" but this was definitely at the top of the list IMO as one of the most violent ones they've done not based off blood or weapons but just the physical punishment both men took as well as gave.
SummerSlam '96

Buried Alive Match vs. Steve Austin - A match that most people forgot happened but this was setup as Taker cost Austin his only title shot against The Rock so for Austin to be entered in the Royal Rumble to gain another title shot, he had to go through Taker in this match. This fight started in the isle with Taker resorting to choking Austin with a guardrail before eventually fighting back to the ring & trying to work over Austin's arm. They once again took the brawl to the floor & to the grave at one point with both men using what they could get their hands on such as chairs & gas cans. Austin was able to finally stun Taker into the grave before getting some more help from not only someone else who had issues with Taker at the time but also some ""heavy machinery"" before claiming his victory.
""IYH: Rock Bottom"" Dec. '98

Inferno Match vs. Kane - While their match at Unforgiven '98 is the most famous inferno match between these two, this was a rare lost one that happened on RAW during the time Undertaker formed his Ministry with the intent to take the WWE away from Vince McMahon so Vince sent Kane into this match to take care of Taker. This was very similar to the previous inferno match in that they were limited in what they could do due to the flames at ringside so they mostly relied on executing power moves with the fight eventually spilling over & ending on the outside of the ring. However the bigger issue here was Vince doing commentary at ringside before receiving a gift that had him so emotionally distracted that he was even brought to his knees with what Taker did to the gift after the match.
""RAW"" Feb. '99

vs. Big Show - This was their first meeting & Show dominated early causing Undertaker to resort to desperate measures early by trying to smother Show with ether & later just completely destroying a baseball bat over Show's head. This was really nothing more than a setup for...
""RAW"" May '99

WWE Championship Match vs. Big Show - ...this rematch which was a complete brawl from start to finish with the referee letting them get away than what they normally would such as Taker using a chair. However what this match is remembered for more than anything else is Big Show chokeslaming Undertaker through the ring.
""RAW"" June '99

Concrete Crypt Match vs. Dudley Boys - Wrestlecrap at it's finest as Undertaker for the most part beat up the WWE Tag Team Champions with Paul Heyman running his mouth non-stop for most of the match until the end when Taker won the match & scared off Heyman & ended up burying Paul Bearer in the concrete himself.
Great American Bash '04
[OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

Casket Match vs. Heidenreich - Heidenreich made it clear that he was scared of caskets & kept trying to stay away from it so Taker used that to his advantage by constantly moving him towards the casket to the point where Heidenreich even ran away from it. Taker at one point used a triangle choke to knock Heidenreich out before Snitsky got involved leading to a brief reunion of the ""Brothers Of Destruction"" with Kane also making an appearance to help his brother & go Snitsky. Heidenreich was able to get an advantage at one point using a modified cobra clutch before Taker recovered & executed his trademark legdrop on the apron with Heidenreich's head wedged in between the casket & it's lid before Taker eventually got the victory. This match was very similar to the earlier matches Taker had against Kama & King Mabel in that Heidenreich was very limited in what he could do in the ring so the gimmick was added to match this match better than what it normally would be.
Royal Rumble '05

Casket Match vs. Randy & Bob Orton - As expected in a handicap match situation, the Orton's kept trying to corner & double team Taker while Taker's strategy was to hit & move when both of them were. Taker was able to focus on one man when the other was out of the way for a few moments such as using a chair on Randy while choking out Bob with the triangle choke. Bob resorted to desperate tactics like using a fire extinguisher to blind Taker while Orton was able to knock Taker out with a chair for a victory but it was the aftermath of the match that made the strongest impression on everyone.
No Mercy '05
[Randy Orton: Evolution Of A Predator]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell. Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps. Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair. Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own. This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.
Armageddon 05
[Hell In A Cell]

Last Man Standing Match vs. Great Khali - Taker utilized different sets of strategy in this match to take down Khali such as trying to chop Khali down by taking out his legs & later attempting to choke him out with the triangle choke using the ring ropes for extra leverage. Khali's manager, Davari, did get involved here with Taker chasing him up the stage leaving him open for Khali to throw him off of it. Khali did his usual ""kick/chop"" offense while Taker brawled with Khali & even using weapons like the steel steps & a chair to finally keep Khali down for a 10 count. This was another match where Taker had to work with another ""big"" man who was very limited in what he can do so adding a special stipulation made this match better than it would have been in a regular contest.
""SmackDown"" August '06

First Blood Match vs. Mr. Kennedy - Although they didn't show the pre-match promo, it was mentioned during the match that Kennedy had put Vaseline on his forehead to prevent that area from bleeding but that didn't stop Taker as he heavily focused on Kennedy's head by slamming it on the announce table & steel steps while delivering hard punches, headbutts, and kicks. Undertaker also focused on Kennedy's ribs by ramming them into the ring post, punches & kicks, and even delivering a superplex with the intent of going for internal bleeding. Kennedy used dirty tactics such as low blow to break Taker's dominance before M.V.P. came to ringside & ended up being the deciding factor in the match...but not the way he intended to be but stay tune for the aftermath when Taker gave Kennedy one of the hardest chairshots you've heard.
Survivor Series '06

Last Ride Match vs. Mr. Kennedy - With the way their previous two encounters ended, this was the final encounter with the only way to win the match is to stuff your opposition in the back of a hearse & drive it out of the arena. Kennedy tried to avoid Taker early but that didn't last long as Taker caught up to him & launched Kennedy off the announce table onto the apron. This match evolved into a brawl that saw Kennedy keep trying to escape through the fans before finally getting some momentum in by reversing the tombstone into a real naked choke & using a chair with Taker getting up from each shot. The fought onto the top of the stage where Taker ended up taking on hell of a fall down...which only seemed to anger him more to the point where he used a chair & pipe before finishing off Kennedy with both a chokeslam & tombstone on top of the hearse.
Armageddon '06

World Heavyweight Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Batista - A great match with both men using their power moves against each other & each one also selling their injuries (Batista's leg & Taker's arm). Although the finish of the match was a draw, don't let that take away from the effort of both men in this match that was an ideal followup to their WM encounter. Look out for Taker's legdrop onto Batista though the announce table because that looked sick!
Backlash '07

vs. Big Daddy V - Big Daddy V used his heavy weight & strength advantage against Taker early & kept relying on it to regain an advantage whenever Taker would gain the momentum but the only thing noteworthy here was Taker's applying the Hell's Gate & keeping it on to the point where V was bleeding from the mouth.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '08

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Undertaker - In the weeks leading up to this match, you saw Edge's personality change & it was showcased in this match as a different Edge wrestled here than you saw in their previous encounters because Edge came off as insane & obsessed with Taking out taker once & for all instead of being scared, intimated, and relying on help like his previous encounters. Taker got the advantage early & used the cell right away as a weapon itself & brought the ringside steps into the ring before Edge quickly countered using the steps himself like spearing Taker right against it before Edge resorted on his past history in T.L.C. matches by using those items as weapons. They went back & forth punishing each other from knocking one off the apron into the cell, one move that was so impactful that it broke the cell wall, using whatever was at ringside including the monitors & TV cameras & announce tables themselves while pulling out their big moves various times such as the spear, chokeslam, and Last Ride before receipts were being given one by one for all the past attacks in their past with the final image being of one person being sent ""straight to hell."" This lived up to what a Hell In A Cell match should be as far as the level of violence & aggression given out by both men.
SummerSlam '08
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

Steel Cage Match vs. Big Show - After meeting in various matches (regular, Last Man Standing, Casket) in the previous months, this was their final encounter inside the steel cage. Show dominated early with his body blows & using the cage to his advantage while Taker kept trying a ""stick & move"" offense. At one point Taker had the chance to escape but make it clear that he wanted to finish off Show more than just win the match. Show countered Taker's chokeslam with one of his own only for Taker to later return the favor & counter his chokeslam with the Hell's Gate to get the final victory.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '08

Two hidden DVD extras are the video packages leading up to his casket matches against Kama & King Mabel.

""He Buries Them Alive"" served the purpose of having two important matches in the career as far as his storylines & character goes in the Yokozuna casket rematch & his return against Ted Dibiase's Undertaker.  ""Deadliest Matches"" was a nice collection that followed up his previous anthology of matches in 2005 & it was nice to get some of the rare gimmick matches of his career.  In the end, this is a nice collection that serves it's purpose & was enjoyable overall so it's something I'd recommend.",1362268800,3,19694,4.442291724328813
