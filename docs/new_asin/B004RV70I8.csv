8439374,5,B004RV70I8,"This movie chronicles the horrendous fire in the Central Highlands of Australia that burned over a million acres.  It tells of animal (and plant) lives lost and saved, and then tells the story of the rebirth of the forest.  It ends with HOPE, and that's something every survivor of a fire needs.  I highly recommend it.",1377734400,,319,4.660714285714286
8439375,4,B004RV70I8,"This documentary supports the idea that from death comes life.  A fire wreaks havoc in a biodiverse area of Australia, but as a  year passes, there are more signs of hope.
If you think that koalas and wombats and kangeroos are soooo cute and exotic, then this work is for you.  They refer to an endangered opossum (sp?) several times, but it looked more like a squirrel to me.  Australian opossums sure are less ugly than their North American equivalents!
Trees that seem dead produce new leaves.  Animals get to eat grubs found in burnt wood.  Birds can live in the area that couldn't in the past.  This was not just an animal tragedy; the fire killed approximately 160 people.  This showed Australians really stepping up to the plate to help wild animals.  I didn't know fish could be endangered, unlike numerous mammals and birds, but they show an endangered fish that one man works on saving.
This work does show a lizard that lost its forelegs and a burnt echidna.  However, I saw an American Humane Society doc that suggested that the non-profit group must put to sleep about half of the animals it receives.  This work didn't suggest the same tragic numbers of unavoidable deaths.
The logging industry is critiqueed here, but nothing is said of global warming.  (I swear I heard Australia has a huge ozone hole above it due to that.)  I think the narrator must have been British, because he didn't sound like the Australian interviewees and didn't sound like an American.  This was vastly different to the Australian doc on cane toads.  That work made it look like that ocuntry could not solve biological disasters and this doc suggested it could.
I think this work would be relevant to many Americans as our country has these same massive fires in its western region.",1307491200,,1775,4.699029126213592
