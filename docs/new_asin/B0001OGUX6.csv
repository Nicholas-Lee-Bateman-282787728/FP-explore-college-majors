8015627,4,B0001OGUX6,"Transfers of ECHO BRIDGE (aka ""Platinum Disc"") public domain movies is about average. No sign of restoration on their 60 and 70 year old films, with none dubbed from pristine studio prints.

POT O' GOLD (1941) - James Stewart, Paulette Goddard, Horace Heidt, Charles Winninger, Mary Gordon, Frank Melton (uncredited: Art Carney, Bud Jamison, Nestor Paiva)
In a picture loosely adapted from a popular radio program, James Stewart, master of many cinematic genres (including comedy), struggles with the only one he was never comfortable in: the musical. Jimmy performs ""When Johnny Toots His Horn"" while co-star Paulette Goddard is backed by Horace Heidt's band on ""Pete the Piper"" and ""Broadway Caballero."" Stewart also fakes playing the harmonica, but actually took up the instrument as a result of some off-screen tutelage here from Jerry Adler (Larry's brother).
