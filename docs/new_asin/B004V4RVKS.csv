8442922,4,B004V4RVKS,Liked it.  Just wish there could have been more of it.,1413417600,,54,3.909090909090909
8442923,1,B004V4RVKS,Amateur production; very shaky video & looks like it was filmed by a hand held camera without a tripod. I've seen better home videos. Very little content or information.,1383955200,,169,4.862068965517241
8442924,1,B004V4RVKS,"This is someone's home movies shot on a terrible, fuzzy camera. Most of the time the picture is at an angle because the person holding the camera apparently has no concept of level. The narrator butchers the names of many of the places they visited. Take Kihei for example. He repeated calls it ""Key-hee"" rather than ""Key-hay."" I mean, if you're going to make a stab at travel film making, at least pronounce the places correctly. The whale watching portion rarely captures the whales because the camera is pointed at the sky or again, cockeyed.

Don't waste a penny on this. Terrible.",1372896000,,585,4.735294117647059
8442925,1,B004V4RVKS,"I have seen many travel videos and this is by far the worst I have encountered.  The shooting and editing are worst than home videos, with excruciatingly long, poorly framed shots of water, harbors, hotel facades, and hillsides.  Shots go in and out of focus, tilt left and right, and you can actually hear when the camera is bumped.  The content and narrative are no more informative than the front page of any travel website on Maui.  Do not waste any money on this DVD.",1313280000,,472,4.517647058823529
