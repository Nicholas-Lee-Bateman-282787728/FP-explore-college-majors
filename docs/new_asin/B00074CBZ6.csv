2199894,5,B00074CBZ6,"Do not believe any of the reviews that state this movie is bad. This is one of the most gloriously bizzare movies you will ever see; a combination of ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" and a spaghetti western, with the ""7 Lives of Dr Lao"" thrown in for good measure.  No matter how many times you see this film, it always seems like you came in at the middle of a different movie.  The camera work is as done by someone with ADD, sometimes obsessive, sometimes wandering but always mesmerizing.  The plot is ... well ... loose.  The acting reminds me of walking into a karioke bar.  The combination will put a smile on your face and a thought in your head ... unless you are just a ""spoil sport.""",1120435200,13,689,4.229007633587786
2199895,1,B00074CBZ6,"Sorry guys, the emperor is naked.  I can't imagine why anyone would give this 5 stars, unless they were stoned or drunk while watching it (and even then it would still stink). Imagine, if you will, a shot of a man walking from his spaceship to a bar.  He appears as a tiny figure trudging across the screen, and this goes on for about a minute.  Exciting? Then this film is for you! Imagine a science fiction film which looks like it was filmed in Kansas, which such exciting locales as a rundown wooden barn floating in space, or a wooden bar on an asteroid (the oxygen leakage must be terrific).  Imagine the villain killing everyone in site, turning them into piles of dirt, which he then rolls in for about five minutes.  I was afraid he was going to copulate with it; thank whatever gods there may be that he didn't.  This stinker has about 15 minutes of actual plot and dialog stretched into an eternity of pain.  It's pretty sad when you find yourself wishing you were watching something much better, like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""The Creeping Terror.""  The only redeeming part of the film was the music, which was unique in a good way.  Hard to classify, but just buy the CD and spare yourself the misery of actually watching this film. It's not funny, it's not a spoof, it's not an homage, it's a pile of fetid dingo's kidneys. Run away, run away!",1115683200,7,1361,4.412
2199896,5,B00074CBZ6,"The American Astronaut is the missing link between Guy Maddin and the early films of David Lynch. Cory McAbee's movie is shot in glorious black and white film stock with unabashedly lo-tech special effects that reside at the opposite end of the spectrum of another retro-SF film, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The American Astronaut has the same grungy, industrial look and feel as Lynch's Eraserhead with the same fierce, independent spirit.

Writer-director-star Cory McAbee has created a unique movie quite unlike anything else out there. While he shares the lo-tech retro look of Guy Maddin's films he isn't interested in recreating the silent era of cinema. McAbee does share a fascination with industrial machinery and the `50s with David Lynch, but he isn't interested in exploring the dark underbelly. McAbee is far more optimistic. The American Astronaut is a fun, off-beat film for people who like something a little different. It has more energy and inventiveness than most of the big budget Hollywood films out there proving yet again that a lot of money can't make up for a lack of ideas and how necessity truly is the mother of invention.

There are several galleries that include a series of cool, sidewalk artwork promoting the movie on various city streets all over the country by Cory McAbee; on-the-set pictures; storyboards and the corresponding stills from the movie; a collection of movie posters; and production artwork.

""Ceres Jump Test Footage"" is a brief clip of McAbee hopping around a city street trying to mimic the lo-gravity depicted in the movie.

There is an audio commentary by McAbee that was shot live at a screening in a Brooklyn bar. McAbee enthusiastically answers questions and recounts production anecdotes in this engaging, entertaining track.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1109721600,33,1836,5.127090301003345
2199897,5,B00074CBZ6,"I saw this for the first time at the Southside Film Festival, and I loved it right away.  It was so refreshingly different from the typical movies that get cranked out by the dozens every year.  I just got the DVD, and I still like it just as much if not more than the first time I saw it.  The humor sort of reminds me of Vonnegut's black humor.  People who like the boring, unimaginitive dribble that is so typical of hollywood will hate this movie, anyone with even a tiny redeeming spark of imagination will love it to death.",1109203200,13,529,4.26

I like eccentric films but I have never seen a movie reinvent what movies can offer in order to create its own engaging world...not to get stodgy: It's still full of Rock and Roll, Space barns, ray guns, shaving and dance contests. Unreal.

Some movies off the beaten track are cheap vehicles for bizarre humor or gimmicks. This is just simply the most Original, Innovative and Imaginative movie I saw in 2004.",1108598400,21,660,4.831858407079646
2199900,5,B00074CBZ6,"The american astronaut -- a film review

there was a dance contest
the trophies sit in 2 places -- a spaceship's bow
and on the sink cabinet in the bathroom of a bar on Ceres
the trophies for some reason are tangent to the plot
that's about as good as this gets
beyond that there is the music
which is best experienced without the movie
some of it -- the music -- is not that bad
but there are exceptions

every once in awhile you find yourself in something
and you have to say WTF!!
I found myself there tonite as I watched this Movie
watching this reminded me of how I felt
the first time I saw Rocky Horror years ago
only this is less the musical and more the dance thing -- I guess
I don't think it will have the legs of RHPS
but it should -- it's that kind of a thing

what did your father teach you
apparently nothing
you seriously need to see this movie

and now you say
ay ay ay ay
as you sing with the boy
that saw a woman's breast
singular - it was round and soft

along the way
you meet a baby in a jar
with glasses on
there can be only one
and a galactic serial killer
it's his birthday
he has a party
and oh yeah
he dances too
among the dust piles
of his victims
no trophies were awarded

this is a seriously sick movie
you have to see it

I bet the rest of the movie is much the same
you can finish the review for me
if you get to the end
another job well done

and no you're not good enough to kiss me

there is a nice WIKI page and an IMDb page
and rotten tomatoes gives it a 63%
but the viewers an 88%
it's a sundance film

you can rent it on iTunes or Amazon
do so -- it will tell you a lot about
what we were in 2001
and are becoming
from the eyes of a California Kid
with his HS diploma
who with HIS friend made
at least 10 more movies
according to Wiki

the thoughts for this movie were
formulated by the kid in the 3 years
or so he was homeless
according to the Wiki entry on
Cory McAbee

that someone could put together
all of the details that make this movie
is sick -- visually it may be stunning
if you can wrap your head around
all the other details - which are consistent
to some extent

the whole thing probably needs to be
wiped down with solvent
they show you how
in the movie
if you can call it that

run to your computer now
and rent this - you will regret it
but it will be worth your time

BTW
did you know
dogs can't live on Venus

this is as bad as it gets
you have to see it

I don't want to give too much away
but apparently no animals were hurt
during the filming of this and Venus looks
a lot like earth

the girl with a vagina made of glass
my favorite line of the movie

this is where it ends

2199901,5,B00074CBZ6,"Being an under-produced, shoestring budget, truly independently made ""labor-of-love"" movie, American Astronaut must endure the inevitable (and unavoidable) comparisons to other under-produced, shoestring budget, truly independently made ""labor-of-love"" movies like Eraserhead, Pi, Stranger Than Paradise, and Forbidden Zone.

And, in a sense, that really isn't fair because the aforementioned films have earned an almost sacred place in the history of moviemaking, following the trail blazed by Mission to the Moon and Andalusian Dog.  And let's be honest, placing that sort of pressure and expectation on a movie to favorably compare to those is a pretty rough game.

But in another sense, it's absolutely justified because unlike Hollywoodized ""indie"" productions which, like their Big Studio siblings, are created primarily to reap profits or as vanity projects for actors or directors to try and re-establish their artistic cred, movies like American Astronaut are made from the purest intention - the desire to express a creativity and make art.  And, if someone has the balls to try and play that game, they have to accept the comparisons.

Happily, American Astronaut not only accepts this comparison, it actually compares very well.

Like the best truly independent art movies, American Astronaut combines nifty writing, clever situations, unexpected charm, and gleefully bizarre indulgences.  There are random musical numbers featuring the least-likely singers & dancers; a suitably silly plot, and refreshingly unpretentious actors and performances.

And it's that last quality - the nearly complete lack of ""artistic"" pretention that really endears the movie.  Too often these indie ""art"" movies suffer from the ponderous pomposity of the artist where they try so hard to prove their artistic bona fides that the result is an insufferable exercise in narcissistic self indulgence.  American Astronaut, however, is an indulgence of a different sort.  It's an indulgence of genuine honesty and effort.  It's silly, funny, strange, clever, endearing, and truly entertaining.  Worth not only one, but repeated viewings.

Sadly, however, American Astronaut will never reach beyond a very limited audience.  It will likely remain an undiscovered gem.  But then again, those are often the most rewarding.",1365120000,,2308,5.665697674418604
2199902,4,B00074CBZ6,"Okay. Okay. I'm going to try and not get too excited about this because in a day or so I'll settle down and realize that, as cool and goofy as this movie is, it might not be as great as I think it is at this moment.

Here's the scoop. Sam Curtis, an astronaut with a Bondo Bucket of a ship, needs to deliver a cat to one planet, trade it for a cloned girl whom he must bring to another planet, where he picks up a young guy whom he needs to bring to Venus which is inhabited entirely by women who will, in turn, sexually exhaust the guy. All the time, professor Hess is on his tail and wants to kill him.

This is a tough one to describe. It's so far out in left field you'll need binoculars to watch it. Filmed in glorious black and white, this has a great look to it. The budget seemed quite low but the director, Cory McAbee (of The Billy Nayer Show fame) came up with some inventive ways to get around the lack of dollars. That McAbee is from a rock(?) band accounts for the really bizarre tunes and verse that pepper the proceedings. They're a real hoot. The story is Okay. It's basic and really has no arc. Just watching the weird plot points and listening to some of the oddball dialogue is where the thrill comes in watching this.

This is one of those films that, like ""Eraserhead,"" is all by itself. You can't lump it in with anything else. If weird is your poison, you'll love this.",1362960000,2,1393,4.132841328413284

2199905,2,B00074CBZ6,"Comparisons to David Lynch's early work are merely superficial.  This film is vacuous and vain.  The 'weirdness' is cloyingly affected and pretensious.  It has no authenticity whatsoever, it is stylised, pastiche trash.  See here, works of Quentin Tarantino.  The visual style is nearly entirely lifted from Eraserhead.  Which is perhaps how I managed to get to the end of it.  It is, if nothing else, well shot and creatively depicts the otherwise bland and pointless plot.

Something that I have not seen mentioned in any of the negative reviews, which appear to mostly come from philistine individuals who are all like 'Whoa, I don't like how this lighting forces me to actually decode the aesthetic unlike all the red-block capitals American comedies in which the cinematography is  so prosaicly literal that my sense of intellectual validity and entitlement to entertainment remains completely unchallenged', is the blatant misogyny of this film.  Who knew that a planet inhabited entirely by women turn out to be simpering, coyly charming southern belles in stifling 19th century ballgowns bedecked in flowers, who volunteer to hand over the crown of their society to one nominated patriarch whom they deify, solely worship and pleasure for the tenure of his luxurious existence on their planet. And this is the whole object of their society. There is a character called 'The Boy who Actually Saw a Woman's Breast' ('it was round, and soft.' Just FYI.) who is employed to fuel the morale of an all-male planet of labourers, apparently with an infantile fixation on the alien idea of women and the abstract fascination of something called 'sex'. The way women are regarded and portrayed in this film is totally juvenile. And not in the cool Lynch way where women are unknowable and terrifying objects of fascination motivated by inscrutable desires and logic, and the somewhat nuetered voyeur men who watch them are incapable of understanding or knowing them and are ultimately emasculated by their being relegated to the role of the eye which lacks agency. Just juvenile, immature and insulting to both men and women's intelligence.  I hope the director's personal relationships are fraught with conflict because he giggles and blushes at the sight of his partner's breasts.  Or can't get a hard on unless his sense of his own masculinity is flattered by some submissive, ultra feminine fantasy of a woman.

As to the humour of the film, it is not funny at all.  The dialogue is very similar to the kind of super-blank delivery to be found in Tarantino and Wes Anderson film.  In watching and listening to the painfully affected casualness of the pointless dialogue, I yawned, and felt like I had seen it all before.

This film is fatuous, shallow and infuriating.  In principle, I really like the idea. I like the visual style, even though it is a hackneyed pastiche.  I like the idea of deliberately wooden, overdramatic acting such as can be (respectively) found in the films of David Lynch and early silent film, like Metropolis. I dont't mind that it is inconclusive. I love sci-fi, I think work can be flawed and still great.  I can even handle sexism in film. But this film is a clanging vessel, it's sole purpose to apparently promote the intelligence, taste and creative genius of star, director and writer Billy Nayer, who I suspect very much would like to be regarded as an auteur.  I think Nayer is probably, like Tarantino, a film buff.  This film is a testament to why good art is hard to make.  You need to have a perfect balance of taste and skill. Taste alone isn't going to carry you if you've got nothing to say. This film is like a playlist of the director's taste in film. But it is skillessly executed. There is no moral or philosophical point being expounded, there is no story arc, there is no deep characterisation.  See any of these, and just pick one, and do it really well, to the detriment of the other elements of the film and I will watch it, gladly.

Having said this, it is not unwatchable.  Maybe if you buy it and watch it, you will take some of the ideas and make another, better film. In fact, I implore you to. I will happily watch a film featuring badly animated little models of spaceships if you could just, please, write a good script that actually had some philosophical import.  Nayer would do well to perhaps read some books.  Or watch a Tarkovsky film. And Hedwig, for the purposes of gender ambiguity instruction. Or just stick to making his similarly unoriginal and uninspired but nonetheless superficially enjoyable music.",1327190400,3,4577,4.842105263157895

2199907,5,B00074CBZ6,"This is an easy film to watch, but hard to explain. It's sort of the moral equivalent of The Rocky Horror Show for people who listen Velvet Underground albums. It's ambiguous, ironic, danceable, never obnoxious, and always a lot of fun. It probably even means something, but you can't pin down quite what. Is it about masculinity? Gender roles? Fatherhood? Inter-male relationships? If you could pin it down, it would be a less interesting film.

But mostly it's just fun.",1306368000,,472,4.9
2199908,5,B00074CBZ6,"Forget that the setting is sci-fi.  This story could have just as easily been a western or set in ancient Greece.  McAbee's style of story telling is superb.  One IMDB reviewer dubbed it, ""Firefly the musical, directd by John Waters using Flash Gordon props...""  Not quite on the John Waters, but very close to the mark.  I caught this by accident, the first time, surfing one morning.  Title and brief description seemed so-so.  10 minutes in as the bathroom scene unfolded, I was sitting bolt upright wondering what was coming next!  To be frank, the story ended way too soon...not a plot fault, but I simply could have kept watching where McAbee took me next.  I'd never heard any of the music before and was delighted by the variety.  I have never witnessed such bold efforts in costume, dialogue and filmography.  Some of the shots qualified as 'hall of fame' material.  One shouldn't expect a riveting, life altering storyline.  This is simply about telling a story.  Our hero sets the tone as the lone traveler, weary and homeless.  A strange barter results in an even stranger 'hello' from an old friend.  An even lonelier, malevolent antagonist is introduced early (our narrator) and our hero's expliots becomes increasingly more bizarre.  Special effects are accomplished through camera shifts, shadow and stop motion, a la ancient 'Flash Gordon' technology.  This seeming lack of hi-tech plays perfectly into the fun feel of the film.  The average viewer may have seen 2 or even 3 of the actors before.  Nontheless, the acting is spot-on and the director gets the most out of every scene.  For anyone who enjoys good story-telling and has the sense of humor to have enjoyed 'Firefly' or 'Grosse Pointe Blank' this movie is a must-see.  Five out of five!",1280102400,,1764,4.848993288590604
2199909,5,B00074CBZ6,"American Astronaut is a unique approach to a space/western/musical shot in striking high contrast black and white.  The songs are by the band The Billy Nayer Show of which the Writer/Director/Star, Cory McAbee, is the lead singer and main song writer(he plays many instruments as well).  The music is not genre specific and just as unique as the film.  The Billy Nayer Show also temporarily went by the name American Astronaut when they made music for McAbee's next movie, Stingray Sam.  This time a space/western/musical/serial with themes that interrelate to American Astronaut and yet leave you with a very different feeling.

American Astronaut is not going to be for everyone, as it is quirky and an unusual style of storytelling, but it has a cult following and it seems that people who like it, love it.  The sense of humor in the movie and in McAbee's music is a little off the wall, I think it's fantastic, but there are people who won't understand where it's coming from--You always have that. If you're interested in the film, you should definitely check it out and look into some of Cory McAbees other work.

On a last note, I've noticed that people have the movie up for sale here for very high prices as it is listed as 'discontinued' but, in fact, you can purchase the film and other materials by Cory McAbee [...].

Unfortunately, that mental note got buried somewhere in my brain and I forgot to go. Later I received an email from a friend telling me that the film was going to be shown again locally on the big screen to promote it's DVD release. There was no way I was going to miss out on a second chance to see this film in a theater. Lucky for me, the guy who made the film (Cory McAbee) was there in person to talk about the film and even played some tunes with his band, The Billy Nayer Show.
After watching The American Astronaut and listening to Mr. McAbee speak about making the film, I'm convinced he is a total genius. I will remember that night as one of the most inspiring times in my life.

2199915,5,B00074CBZ6,"Directed by Corey McAbee of the rock/performance/art/film group The Billy Nayer Show (KETCHUP & MUSTARD MAN, reviewed in CdC  #9), THE AMERICAN ASTRONAUT is a cross-pollinated pastiche that plays as a science fiction/musical/comedy/western/road movie shot in beautiful black and white, with occasional low-tech animation, retro-futuristic art direction, and chocked full of catchy tunes, quirky characters, and pure originality.

Rakish pilot Samuel Curtis (McAbee) pilots his flying mobile-home spaceship through the galaxy, on several missions at once.  When we first meet him, he's taking a cat to a run down bar on barren asteroid. He trades the cat for the ingredients of a ""real live girl"" clone.  He meets up with his old dance partner, the Blueberry Pirate (producer Joshua Taylor) who proposes that Sam take the clone to Jupiter, an all male planet, in exchange for ""The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast"" (Greg Russell Cook) before turning around and trading the boy for the former king of Venus, an all female planet.  Corpse in tow, Sam could turn a hefty profit by bringing the deceased king back to his family on Earth.  Got that?  All the while, Sam is pursued by the insane Professor Hess (Rocco Sisto), a birthday boy who kills only those he has no reason to kill.

  One of the things that make this film stand out among other musicals is that the songs are mere excuses for absurdity, rather than devices to progress the story.  The music resembles avant-rock more than show tunes.  The only exception is a song sung by a miner explaining how he and his clan ended up floating around space in a barn.  Again, the song does not progress the film's story but explains the existence of some mostly insignificant characters and one minor character, and contains the only lyrics that sound specifically written for the film.

  THE AMERICAN ASTRONAUT feels like it is only one episode in the many adventures of Samuel Curtis.  When the ending comes, it comes abruptly, as if McAbee is saying to the audience, ""You already know how this is likely to end, so let's just stop here.""  McAbee's version of space, though, is one that deserves further exploration.",1149120000,3,2175,4.928571428571429

Not fancy or impressive, but simple and effective.  Not that they're really the point.

Astronaut has many strange musical interludes, which just pop up without reason.  And the dialogue is often full of intentionally awkward moments.  The movie has a leisurely pace, and doesn't rush where it's going.  And when it gets there, it doesn't mind stopping with a simple resolution.  I recommend renting before buying because it won't be to everyone's taste.  But it's a good, unusual film.  And I enjoyed it.",1148947200,2,820,4.697183098591549

And by the end, I was extremely happy that the fates conspired in a way to let me be in a position at the right place and time to view this movie.

Many people are saying ""it's good because it's weird"".
That's not giving people reading the whole story.
It is weird.
But it's good because, it's well, good.

It had none of the elements I look for in a movie.
Yet it's one I'd highly recommend to anyone. Including people like me.",1145836800,4,1276,4.367088607594937
2199919,5,B00074CBZ6,"Why this fun and brilliant film hasn't become this generation's Rocky Horror Picture Show is beyond me.  The Billy Nayer Show has made a film as unique as any I've seen in years.  It's a perfect picture for any fan of sci-fi, camp, comedy, rock, retro, avantgarde or musicals...in short anyone with an imagination and a lust for something both old and new.",1125792000,5,356,4.634920634920635

8044559,1,B00074CBZ6,This film makes very little sense. It has an interesting main story that could be told in maybe 15-20 minutes. This story is then spread out to film length by including a bunch of scenes that could only be amusing while on hardcore drugs. Terrible film.,1436140800,,253,4.521739130434782
8044560,4,B00074CBZ6,"$90 for this film (at the time I wrote this)? You've got to be kidding. Lovers of avant garde comedy may love this odd little flick, and there's some really funny/trippy parts in the first half hour or so, and at the end. The middle section, involving a long space flight with a boy that stinks, didn't do it for me, I thought it was just stupid. Still, adventurous films like this deserve some slack and should be allowed to fail a little. The best parts of the film feature the odd, hard to define music of the Billy Nayer Show; some of the songs are really funny. Is this a stoner film? Probably, but if you're wierd enough you might like it when you're straight. If money's no object, take a flyer on it. If you don't like it, re-sell it for a reasonable price. I'll buy it.",1435104000,,778,4.228187919463087
