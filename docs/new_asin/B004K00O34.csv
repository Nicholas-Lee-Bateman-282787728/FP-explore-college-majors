4391970,5,B004K00O34,"Really funny movie! Don't buy this if you don't like headbanging, f-bombing, beer drinking, pot smoking Canadians! If you can get past that, or if you liked the Great White North, or Strange Brew, you'll probably love this one. Especially funny is when they go to get jobs in the oil fields up North. Don't worry. It has a kind of happy ending. Buy this!",1349827200,4,354,4.461538461538462
4391971,5,B004K00O34,"If you liked the first film, then you need to see the sequel.

The budget is obviously higher, the script is more developed, the characters are a bit more over the top and the jokes and gags come at a much faster pace.  This is Fubar on roids, or crank (whichever you prefer).  The character ""Tron"" from the first movie went from rather sedate to being the most over the top character in the whole story.  It is a good thing in my opinion.  If you liked the slower pace and complete lack of budget in the first movie, then you might be turned off by this ramped up sequel.

It is a very direct sequel.  The main theme of testicular cancer and how Terry and Deaner deal with it is once again the central point of the story.  This time there is also a major ""romance"" plot, which is something that can ruin a good comedy, but this romance plot is clever and written and executed well and not tacked on.

I've watched it twice and it is just as good as the first, if not better.",1349222400,6,975,4.1436170212765955
4391972,5,B004K00O34,"If you like movies such as Dumb & Dumber, Freddie Got Fingered, etc...buy this.  I found it very entertaining.  Even my wife enjoyed it and she typically hates when I watch movies like this.",1348531200,3,190,4.5588235294117645
4391973,4,B004K00O34,"Okay,
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but the last review written for Fubar: Balls to the Wall was unfair and misleading.
If you liked the first movie you will love the sequel. Granted the storyline is a bit out there but with the two main characters lives and mind set it's a comedy gem. Canadian humor and jokes are different than here in the US. You either get it or you don't reading the last review he really did not get it!

The movie starts with Terry throwing a party for Dean to celebrate 5 years of cancer free life. If you saw the 1st movie Dean finds out he has cancer and loses ""a nut"" It's crude but funny. The party goes from a celebration to an eviction party when Tron shows up. He also tells Terry he has jobs for both of them. The two take him up on his offer working on oil lines in brutal elements and dangerous conditions. Terry falls in love with the barmaid at the local strip club. While Dean tries to do the work as the movie goes on Dean is not dealing with the job or Terry girlfriend that well. He ends up betraying Terry, agrees to share 50% percent of the workmens comp to Tron. By letting Tron smash his ankle after the tests for the paper work Dean finds himself face to face with his cancer doctor who he skipped out on. He is told the only course of treatment to stay alive is to have it removed and chemo.

Terry is living with his girlfriend he learns that she slept with Dean. While the two argue he also finds out she is pregnet. Since he is sterile he knows Dean is the real father. Terry and Dean have a fight and stop talking meanwhile the oil prices plummet and Terry loses his job on the mighty Mac. Dean is now living out of his car misses his little girl and decides on Boxing day ""Christmas"" he will end it all with Tron after the two make a pact. The movie is funny, out there but has heart. Terry soon learns of Deans cancer and decides to cheer him up by inviting his ex girlfriend and daughter to spend Boxing Day to cheer Dean up.
After dinner during karaoke a true Christmas miracle happens when Dean sings. He is able to hit very high notes due to his recent surgery. It's out there as far as Spinal Tap only this time you see the real side of the two head banging berr drinking stoners hearts.

It's not an Oscar winning film but I laughed and felt for each character. If you liked or loved the 1st movie. I know you will enjoy the sequel. You may even like it more it keeps the same humor and jokes only adds more emotions.",1321142400,8,2489,4.1384297520661155
4391974,3,B004K00O34,"Well I figure Fubar: Balls to the Wall would either be a major flop or an underground classic, and... according to the small number of reviews here on amazon (only 2 so far) it's pretty safe to say nobody will be remembering this mediocre attempt at comedy.

It's about two long-haired, drugged out goofballs who take an adventurous trip up north.  Neither of these two characters are particularly funny and in fact, character-wise, they're both pretty dry, uninspiring and just plain idiotic without the actual laughs to back either of them up.

Maybe it's just me who sees a similarity, but one of the friends seriously looks like former WWE wrestler Al Snow.  Same exact face.

The storyline is the movies biggest flaw.  There really *isn't* one.  If there is, it's basically a gag reel of unrelated segments strung together in a ham-fisted kind of way.  However, some of them are sort of hilarious.  I liked when the one overweight bartender woman went crazy with a machine gun and then turned around and slept with BOTH friends.  She was actually the funniest character in the movie.

I suppose the turkey chasing segment later on was pretty funny, as was the cat shooting in the woods, the clumsy ""fight"" scene involving ""Santa Claus"" and the segment that involved a deliberate attempt to hurt an employee at work as a way to collect some easy money.  Oh, and the kids were actually funny because of their facial expressions.  It was never really clear what their thoughts and opinions were concerning the adults, but they certainly acted like they were embarrassed to be around them!

These were okay enough to give Fubar: Balls to the Wall a 3-star rating, but seriously, 5 stars?  Nooooo way!  The storyline's just too disconnected and unorganized to recommend it.",1320710400,,1773,4.821192052980132
4391975,5,B004K00O34,"I first saw this movie and thought, Gee this looks really dumb but why not give it a try. After seeing this movie i can say that it truly was a shocker on how hilarious it is and how much i wanted to see it again after. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes to the type of comedy that is just dumb sometimes but that can also have a pretty cool story. I would say i put this up with Dumb and Dumber. I would also recommend having a beer or more to this movie because it will make the movie even funnier.",1319328000,3,515,3.8679245283018866
