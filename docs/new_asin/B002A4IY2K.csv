3883219,5,B002A4IY2K,"I saw the beginning of this movie in 2003, while visiting my sister in Michigan. It was her birthday and we had to leave to make dinner reservations. My sister passed away in 2004 and I had searched for the movie to see the end. I finally found it before the Christmas holiday and ordered it. I invited my other sisters (3, who were also in Michigan when I saw this movie) to finish watching the end with me. We all cried. It was wonderful!!! I was inspired to follow my dream, no matter what others say!!! This is a wonderful movie to see for women who need to be encouraged!!!",1392336000,3,578,4.216216216216216
3883220,5,B002A4IY2K,"I found this movie very inspiring. It is great seeing a Woman (Ann-Margret) who came out of a very unhappy marriage with a VERY controlling husband, and follows her heart. Like a catepillar opening up to a beautiful singing butterfly. Ann-Margret does a beautiful, sensitive performance. This movie will leave you with a smile!",1365379200,4,327,5.074074074074074

3883222,3,B002A4IY2K,"Actress turned director Lee Grant takes the reins in this musty cliche ridden ""follow your dreams"" film about a dominated, unhappy wife (Ann-Margret) trapped in a loveless marriage who dreams of going to Nashville and getting into the music business. When her sour faced spouse (William Morgan Sheppard) kicks the bucket, she tentatively begins her journey. Every possible overused hackneyed plot device comes into play as regularly as clockwork. Fortunately, Ann-Margret generates a lot of goodwill in the part and it's hard to resist her. George Segal, Brenda Vaccaro, Travis Tritt and Scott Marlowe co-star.

The Echo Bridge DVD is an adequate full screen transfer.",1316304000,5,668,5.3619047619047615
3883223,5,B002A4IY2K,This is one of my favorite movies.  Ann-Margret did such great job of showing how a woman can move beyond an abuse situation and become the person that she knew she always wanted to be. In the process finding someone to really love and care about her.,1282953600,6,251,4.340425531914893
8358875,5,B002A4IY2K,"The movie, Following her Heart, was a sweet movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lena was married at 16, a child bride, and led a miserable married life, dominated totally by her bully of a husband.  I had the same sort of husband, so I knew what she was enduring in her marriage.  He tried to control her even after he died by limiting her to how much she could spend.  Sounds familiar?  She did find love and was able to erase her son-in-law from her life because he as also domineering and tried to control her.  She finally found true love with a new husband who truly loved her and did not dominate her in any way.  I was cheering her all the way.  She was finally free to be who she truly was. Great movie.",1528329600,,711,4.138686131386861

8358877,3,B002A4IY2K,"I worked on this movie production, both as an extra and a PA, so it has a special place in my heart.  This is the first time I've seen it after all these years.  Slow in the beginning, picks up steam at the second act, more satisfying from there to the end.  This particular recording is not the best quality and has the initial credits truncated so you don't really get the whole shebang but in any event who doesn't love Ann-Margret.",1515628800,4,435,4.280487804878049

8358884,2,B002A4IY2K,"I love this charming and endearing movie, with fine acting and so much heart.  I had recorded the movie from TV in 1994 with most commercials successfully edited.  Recently, I dubbed my tape to DVD, but decided I wanted the movie without any commercialsand I wanted better picture quality.  When I saw the movie available from Amazon, I was thrilled and made my purchase.  The DVD I received was SO bad, it didn't come close to the picture quality that I recorded on videotape 20 years ago!  I returned the DVD for a refund.",1440374400,3,524,4.531914893617022
