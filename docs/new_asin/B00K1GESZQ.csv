8655161,5,B00K1GESZQ,"This disc originates from an ambitious outdoors event held in the Market square, Leipzig. The linking factor bringing this considerable array of talent together is the inspiration of Bobby McFerrin supported by Nigel Kennedy. There can be no doubt that Bobby McFerrin proves to be fully up to the task as both an organiser and as a participator.

The programme is as wide ranging as the participants and the music performed effortlessly spans across the classical and jazz worlds as well as world music featuring vocal groups with their own particular focusses such as the Bulgarian Voices, The Karumba Singers, Mari Boine and Band as well as the Al-Kindi ensemble with their Whirling Dervishes.

This concert is therefore that rare example of consisting of true cross-over content but one where each participant remains true to their own non-crossover content. The concert programme is therefore a cross-over event but the individual parts are not in themselves cross-over.

What is also most notable is the very high level of both performing ability and of musical content. Variety is supposed to be the spice of life and this concert offers plenty of spice.

It would be invidious to single out individuals or groups for particular praise as all are equally deserving of it. However, it would also be wrong not to mention the essential part played by Bobby McFerrin throughout either as a performer or as an enabler who pulls the whole thing together as a convincing whole.

Although the event is an outdoor recording, there are no compromises to be made as regards the recorded product. Imaging is crisp, clear and involving throughout and the sound is uniformly excellent and is offered in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 as well as stereo. Subtitles are provided in English, German, French and Italian.

This was clearly a very enjoyable event and the recording captures it perfectly",1404432000,4,1884,5.022435897435898
