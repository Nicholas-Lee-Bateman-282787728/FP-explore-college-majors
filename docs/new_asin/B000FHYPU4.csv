8122623,5,B000FHYPU4,Sometimes you think you would know how to get your child to swim but this has some of the best information I could ever find and my baby liked to even watch it with me!,1211500800,,168,3.8285714285714287
8122624,2,B000FHYPU4,As a swimming instructor I am always looking for new videos to help parents have a resource in addition to my swimming lessons.  This video has a whole lot of talking and not a lot of showing...for a busy parent this video is a waste of time.  I would not recommend this video.,1208649600,6,277,4.2075471698113205
8122625,4,B000FHYPU4,"just a quick note - this is a great and HONEST introduction to getting children in the water - first time fears and all, and GAYLENE has a great approach to very gradually introducing kids to water and hence 'fostering a love of swimming'...
i enjoyed it alot and am using some of the strategies to introduce kids to the water too, gaylene is a beautiful role model for anyone looking to do the same, all smiles and very positive and loving in her approach with the kids, yet very patient and attentive also.

a great DVD, with later stages a must also for kids progressing, the complete dvd was a bit short tho, only 20 mins, 30+ minutes would've been better.",1191369600,3,660,4.409836065573771
