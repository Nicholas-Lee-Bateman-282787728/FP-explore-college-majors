RKO Radio Pictures presents Gunga Din as told through the lives of three famous comrades in Her Majesty's Service. Sergeant MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), and Sergeant Cutter (Cary Grant).

After 50 years of dormancy the Thugs (worshipers of the goddess Kali) raise again. They threaten to run the British out of India. Let's put it this way they are the bad guys. Their layer is stumbled upon by three adventuring shoulders. Helping them in their pursuit fights and potentially saving the day is a water boy by the name of Gunga Den (Sam Jaffe.)

The movie is fast paced with lots of marching and saber rattling. This presentation is accompanied with music only could be described as swashbuckling. The music is by Alfred Newman.
