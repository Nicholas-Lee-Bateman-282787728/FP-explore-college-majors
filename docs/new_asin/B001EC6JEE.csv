8297606,5,B001EC6JEE,Practice using this CD weekly.  It is very versatile.  I have quite a Rodney Yee yoga library.  This was a great addition.,1465344000,,122,4.454545454545454
8297607,3,B001EC6JEE,Exercises are good and fairly easy but you must be prepared to do yoga for at least one hour.  No short cuts here.,1438041600,,114,3.9565217391304346
8297608,5,B001EC6JEE,"This makes an excellent starting DVD.  Great ideas to do yoga where ever you are.  Standing in line, sitting at a desk.  Definitely worth checking it out.  Rodney is awesome and Coleen is good too.",1423785600,,197,4.542857142857143
8297609,4,B001EC6JEE,"I really like this DVD. Just perfect for beginners and for people who have physical challenges. The first half of the DVD is all done in a chair so how much easier can that be.
I definitely saw the benefits by the 2nd time I used the DVD and now I'm noticing the increase in balance. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and in fact, I bought one for my nephew to try to help with his back problems. Within a week, he started walking better!",1386374400,2,448,4.160919540229885
8297610,5,B001EC6JEE,Very good to start a beginner off. Excellent for working the core. Especially good for those who want to try yoga but don't want to crawl around on the floor.,1381968000,,158,4.3
8297611,5,B001EC6JEE,"Gives one a step by step experience on how to practice yoga most effectively-almost anywhere. I have had chronic pain for many years and experienced every allopathic treatment known. I have gotten more relief from a Yoga practice, including this DVD than I've ever gotten from any treatment by a Dr. AWESOme!",1373760000,,308,4.9423076923076925
8297612,5,B001EC6JEE,"I purchased this when I injured my knee. I love to do yoga, but could no longer do the standing poses. It worked great. Most of the poses are seated. I was able to do almost every pose even with my injury. If you need a really gentle yoga practice, or need to stay away from standing poses I highly recommend this.",1297209600,6,314,4.080645161290323
8297613,4,B001EC6JEE,"Although there are 'no props' as stated, you must access to a stable chair, one where your feet can comfortably touch the ground. It does need to be quite sturdy as there are some exercises where you push your body weight against it.

The first 30 minutes is all chair poses, guided by Rodney. This section focuses greatly on the shoulders, waist, back, and hips. For those like me who sit at the computer all day these are perfect. It felt amazing. These poses are not difficult and are rather gentle.

Colleen instructs for the second half. I felt her section could use longer calve leg stretches, but she does focus on balance and hips (like Rodney) quite nicely.

I've been looking for a Gaiam video that does not consist of a lot of weight bearing exercises, one that does not increase my heart rate. Instead, I was looking for an intro for gentle, relaxed stretches, something I can do before meditation. This does the job. After completing this video I just like to lay on the floor and meditate, it just relaxes me so. This video is also great for those who want to start stretching without going full on yoga. You'll become more flexible and have improved balance, but you won't increase your strength.

I would have given this 5 stars if this actually had a 'seated meditation session' as stated. In reality, it is more of a 3 minute conclusion. By the time you get into it, it's over. If they had tagged on 15-20 minutes of relaxing audio on the end (for those of us who do not want it to end) I would have easily given this 5 stars. Maritza's Meditation for Beginners is excellent for this, however.

The cues are sometimes a little early, but they are always very concise and never come too late. Also note that this was filmed in a studio. Gaiam has some of the best scenic videos out there - but this is not one of them. Expect to see some wallpaper of trees instead.

This is not one of those ""do at your office desk"" type of videos, for those who are curious. You'll be getting out of your seat and rotating around the chair quite a bit. But none of it is strenuous.

Hey, I'm glad I bought it.",1264204800,20,2111,4.369897959183674
