7839983,4,6303102859,"Sure, this is a Italian movie dubbed over to english, but it does work for me.  It's a story about a reporter who ends up ""landing"" the story of a lifetime, but he can not get the word out until it's too late, and the Zombies are taking over the city.  What happens next, watch this flick.

Sure, the acting is lackluster, and the script is so so, but the gore special effects and the overall approach of the film is just different enough to make this a decent film to add to a zombie collectors shelf.",1163289600,,502,4.154639175257732
7839984,2,6303102859,"I rented ""City of the Walking Dead"" expecting it to be similar to Lucio Fulci's masterpiece ""Zombie."" I was horribly disappointed to find ""City of the Walking Dead"" to be one of the most boring experiences I have subjected myself to. The zombies or whatever they are are more like mindless vampires preying on the blood of the inhabitants of the city. They have disfigured mutilated faces, but look ridiculous rather than convincingly scary. Don't watch unless you are a serious masochist.",1123459200,,489,4.975609756097561
7839985,1,6303102859,"A couple of my buddies and I have recently been on a sort of zombie kick.  The 1990 remake of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead was on television a couple of times in which we watched... and it began.

So, we went to the local video store a couple of times to find the original version of Dawn of the Dead.  No dice.  Somebody apparently has had it taken out for more than a year.  As unsettling as that is, we had to look for some sort of other zombie flick in the fading VHS Horror section of the store.  There's Blood Diner, Zipperface, Slumber Party Massacre, and wait what's this?  City of the Walking Dead.

The cover of the box displayed a naked chick covered in blood.  The back explained that zombies have appeared due to a nuclear disaster of sorts.  There were no screenshots, but what the Hell?  We rented it, ordered a pizza, and figured we'd kick back and enjoy this zombie movie.  It was a Wednesday night, there was nothing else to do.

I apologize for the dragged out preamble to this review.  But I figure I must document how one would be vulnerable and become tricked by a movie entitled City of the Walking Dead.

Where to begin?  An unidentified airplane lands in an airport.  The special forces are surrounding the craft, ready for disaster.  Reporters are there waiting for something to happen.  My friends and I are waiting for something zombie-like.  THEN, the door opens.  A professor comes out... followed by a horde of ""zombies"" carrying weapons.  Begin the ""zombie"" gun fight.

""Zombie"" gun fight?  Can you name everything that is wrong with that phrase.  Every word is wrong.  ""Zombie"" is in quotes, meaning that they are not even zombies.  Zombies shouldn't be carrying guns.  And they shouldn't really be fighting.. just biting.  Which brings me to my next point.

These creatures suck the blood of the living.  Vampires do that.  Vampires suck.  So they are eating blood.  Now, I'm not one for gore.  But I was equally disappointed that there was little to no gore being shown at all.  The ""zombies"" were not even being shown that often.  The camera was shaky the entire movie.  Camera angles were cutting off half of everyone's face and whatnot.  The zombies should be cutting off half of everyone's face!

There is nothing good about this movie.  Whether you're looking for dumb fun or a good film, this movie is not for you.  This movie is for nobody.  The ending, which I feel like I am about to reveal is the most awful ending to any film every created.  i won't reveal it though.

The only thing I got satisfaction out of was watching a young woman fall out of a helicopter.

And that means this is a bad film all around.",1117152000,5,2667,4.49685534591195
7839986,5,6303102859,"I don't care what anyone says. I grew up Loving this movie! The FX were a little bit cheezy but lets face it, the concept is genious, it's an italian movie, and was made in the early 80's. OK, so the zombies start off running out of a plane and kill everyone, lame. But I was getting tired of seeing Zombies coming out of grave yards and science labs anyway :P Give this movie a chance for a remake, and it'll be a top rated horror film. These Zombies are actually intelligent, Quick, and look very unique. Heck, They even RUN after people for once. Instead of ... *scream* and have some dumb blond get eaten by a zombie, coming at a blazing 1 step per second.

If you watch this movie too critically, U'll hate it. But if you watch it from a realistic point of view, it's not a bad movie at all.

ps. The dumbest part of this movie is the Human reaction of some of the victims LMAO.Cheers",1098489600,,889,4.162790697674419
7839987,4,6303102859,"This film, as many foreign horror thrillers were, was edited down and re-named for American audiences in the 80's. Originally 'Nightmare City', a fast-paced and unusually entertaining Zombie-thriller from Europe, this version is to be avoided if you're a Zombie movie buff as I am. Deemed too sadistic for domestic movie-goers as were 'Don't open the Window' (originally 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie'), and 'Dr. Butcher, M.D.' (orig. 'Zombi Holocaust') the uncut film is the one to seek out.  As the film opens, an army plane lands and parks on a runway with no communication coming from the cockpit. Soldiers surround, guns raised in anticipation of any possible crisis, and boy are they faced with one. The door opens, and a wave of fully armed(!) horrifying Zombies disembark, beating, slashing, and biting any and all they confront. Only a precious few led by our intrepid reporter/hero can spread the news and warn the masses of the evil descending on the city. Structured like one of those 70's disaster films (but with Zombies instead of bees or tidal waves), this is a blast of a horror film.",997315200,4,1097,4.92972972972973
7839988,1,6303102859,"I first saw this Spaghetti cheese-fest back in 1997 and thoroughly hated it.  I rented it again recently (as I had gotten into Fulci and Argento) and hated it just as much.  Umberto Lenzi's ham-fisted attempt at a horror/zombie movie falls flat on pretty much every account, basically because it's so lazy.  The story centers around a reporter and his doctor wife on the run from a plague of mutant zombies (who can run around and brandish weapons, ha!) as the military attempts to combat the situation.  Maybe if Lucio Fulci was directing and Giannetto De Rossi was doing the makeup, ""City of the Walking Dead"" might have actually been pretty good, but it isn't, and it really sucks.  I never thought I'd have to see a movie where it looked like the actors needed lessons on ""how to be a zombie.""  Even if you're a fan of Italian horror, you'd be better off skipping over this.",981936000,4,878,4.560509554140127
7839989,2,6303102859,"my sister saw mel ferrar was in this movie and thought it couldn't be ALL bad.  i saw mel ferrar and figured he was desperate for a job. guess who was right?  okay.....it's total cheese, but sometimes that's what makes  these movies watchable.  my favorite scene -- husband and wife are running  from the zombies in a car....they realize they need gas.....they stop at a  deserted gas station....and proceed to go inside to enjoy a cup of coffee!  they actually took the time to make it AND comment on how it's not the  best because it's only instant coffee.  if that's not a ""b"" movie  moment, i'm not sure what is.",953510400,3,616,4.468468468468468
