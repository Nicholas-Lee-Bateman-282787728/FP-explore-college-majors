7919383,3,B00003TKEO,"This is the second Christi Taylor video I've tried, and I think it will probably be my last.  Those who enjoy advanced choreography--including frequent directional changes, turns, etc.--are likely to enjoy this video, but I've found that complicated aerobic workouts are just not for me.

Christi's 7-minute warm-up immediately introduces you to some of the moves that you will use in the first aerobics pattern, and she also includes a series of stretches.  During the aerobics portion, Christi first teaches a very simple, easy-to-follow combo, but then she increases the intensity and complexity by adding on, which usually included arm movements and directional changes.  She utilizes a ""take it from the top"" teaching style in which she frequently returns to the very beginning, combining all combos learned thus far.  There are about six different sequences in this workout, and at the end of the aerobics portion, Christi runs through the entire routine several times in a row, bringing the aerobics in at about 39 minutes.

At the end of the aerobics, Christi spends about 2.5 minutes stretching before moving on to the abs work.  In this segment, Christi does not perform the moves herself; rather, she supervises two of her background exercisers.  The abs work consists mainly of standard crunches, but Christi ups the challenge by performing many of the moves with one leg in the air as well as inserting plank holds between the abs sets.  The abs section is about 10 minutes long, and then Christi finishes with a few more quick stretches to bring the entire workout time in at just under an hour (I clocked it at 59 minutes).

Although I actually found the aerobics portion here to be slightly more easier to follow than the other Christi video I had tried, it was still very confusing to me.  As a result, I found myself frequently modifying the routine (sticking with the initial simplier version of the move, cutting out the turns, etc.) to the extent that I wasn't able to keep my heart rate consistent and didn't feel like I got a very good workout.  While this is definitely a solid workout for those who enjoy complex cardio routines, choreography klutzes like myself would do best to look elsewhere.",1134950400,,2220,4.906417112299465
