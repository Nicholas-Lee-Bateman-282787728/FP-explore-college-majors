8404769,5,B003SXHZHW,"The second season is arguably the best season of this series. Matt Frewer joined the show as the new lead actor (replacing the previous lead actor). Also, the series started featuring only one story per hour-long episode, featured more characterization, and became more dramatic overall. It was also less focused on the technical parts of the investigations, unlike the first season. It was one of the most entertaining syndicated TV series from the 1990's.",1522454400,,457,5.1891891891891895
8404770,5,B003SXHZHW,"Great show based on real paranormal cases investigated by the real OSIR. I wish there were more DVD sets of the show available. I preferred the original Cheif Case Manager from the first season, but the new actor that they brought in for the next season was ok.",1512518400,,261,4.458333333333333
