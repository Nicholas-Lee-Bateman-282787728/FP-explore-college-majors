7685160,3,B01CO70KX8,"Sorry about this, but there will be spoliers aplenty in this review as so much about Season 3 drove me crazy. I'm fully committed to see this series through to the end but of the first three seasons, this is the weakest. Way too many episodes are spent on holding the Jews at the school. I'm sure situations like this did happen in WWII, but this is a TV series and the pace needed to be picked up. After all, the situation was completely static as the Jews were held in limbo and couldn't move forward or go backwards at all. Basically, the first three episodes could have been done and dusted much faster.

Then there was the criminally missed chance to show exactly how Hortense was saved from being shipped out on the notorious trains by Servior. Hortense just shows up back at the Larcher household and says the government official Servier saved her on the platform from being sent eventually to Auschwitz via Drancy. Why not have that dramatic scene played to the hilt? Maybe because the actress playing Hortense is just so terrible (go read my Season 2 review for my thoughts on Mrs. In External Shock Mode).

As well we see very little of Mr. Schwartz and although Maria is playing a far more key role now with the Resistance, she really needs to be on screen much more. Anyway, I just think the direction the storylines are headed seem way off as far as my own interest level. The Communists are still complete idiots. I still don't get why Marcel Larcher no matter how dangerous it is doesn't attempt to see his son, Gustave.

Then we get all of one scene of a personal fave in Detective De Kerven who I assumed was long gone given Madame Morhange seemed to be on her own now. On the flip side way too much of Detective Marchetti and...if you can believe this the Gestapo chief Muller is back from the Russian Front. How did that happen? Also, why would they reassign him back to some tiny village in France? Give us some explanation how he pulled strings to return to this posting.

I don't know. Other than Sarah finally hooking up with Dr. Larcher and Episode Six being one of finally something good starts happening episodes, this season dragged a bit for me. Don't even get me started on how the French police hide behind a convenient woodpile to monitor the Germain farm to attempt to take down the Resistance cell. Why was there no attempt to cut off escape routes on the other three sides of the property? It's almost farcical.

The extras, as usual, are fantastic with interview clips of French men and women who survived the war and fought in the Resistance or were Jews hiding from the Nazis and French police. Amazing stuff and maybe what they were saying should have been incoporated more into the series.",1493337600,,2728,4.51417004048583

7685171,5,B01CO70KX8,"Bon jour. The series is too good to miss. This is a historical moment in French life in World War Two from which we see the effect of war on the people of the village of Villeneuve. Each character faces evil and danger and each needs to evolve with the times and survive. We experience the hatred of the Jews, the lukewarm support for the Vichy regime of Petain, the evolvement of the Black Market, the development of the resistance, the antipathy to Religion, the collaboration with the Nazis. It would help to have some knowledge of WWII France to better understand the Nazis in the North, Petain in the South. Could this happen here in the USA? Maybe. Watch for the parallels of a disintregating society. As an American, there might be too much gratuitous sex and the constant smoking of cigarettes to be comfortable with. Also, most of the non-Jewish characters were given a ""break"" or second chance, but one, the Lesbian, and I thought that this was deliberate by the writers.",1483747200,,981,4.64367816091954

This is a French television series, in French, with English subtitles. The show has wonderful characters who come from all walks of life, and the story focuses on several different individuals: the village medical doctor who is also the Mayor, the Mayor's Communist brother, the Mayor's beautiful but unfaithful wife, the school teachers, a business man who does business with the Germans, a beautiful woman farmer who is part of the Resistance, etc.  There are the good French and the bad (collaborators and Vichy).

What in the world is going on?

7685189,5,B01CO70KX8,"This fabulous series brings to life the horrors of World War II from the standpoint of a small provincial French village.  In 1941 ""French-born Jews"" were spared arrest while the Germans and their Vichy collaborators swept up all others. By 1942 no one is safe: Jews, non-Vichy French loyalists, resistance fighters, communists, etc. By the end of Season 3 it has gradually emerged that those who were sent away on trains are most likely not coming back; that the separation of Jewish parents and children had to do with work camps for the latter and extermination of the former; and that the smallest infraction by anyone could lead to execution by the Germans and increasingly the French military.  But fate and luck also play a hand in this.  A two-hour delayed departure of one French Jewish family meant their demise, while others were spared by the same twist of timing and even a softening of the Nazi officers. Nazi raids on hideouts of resistance fighters saw some survivors, again through seemingly random events. I'm addicted. I just bought the entire set of seasons 1-6!",1466985600,2,1082,4.869565217391305

7685195,5,B01CO70KX8,"I can't recommend this series highly enough. We are seeing the characters develop. Beriot and Lucienne's married life is especially touching-there is a scene where she fakes labor to get German troops away from a spot where they're hiding a Jewish child-their expressions when the soldiers leave is priceless. The resistance is growing but they're actions are a tad haphazard. You know they'll run into trouble but you can't help but hope they'll all be ok. The series looks more at what is happening to the Jews. A train transport has to stop in Villeneuve and the Mayor is forced to housing them in the school. The townspeople get a first hand view at what is happening and their police force is instructed to round up as many Jews they can (the higher the number the more they can curry favor with the Germans). One (M's Morhange the former Principle) is released after they'd been taken to Drancy-her stories are bone chilling. Of course we have hindsight. We know where these souls went after Drancy, but seeing these folks grouped in the school imagining it will be ok-they're just going to do some work-it breaks your heart. Inspector Marchetti is revealing what a snake in the grass he is-I keep hoping he'll get his comeuppance, but he always seems to find a way out. That's part of the beauty of this show. You root for some characters, detest others, hope for a different outcome. I feel so invested in their lives and what comes next. Especially wonderful is the short documentary at the end where those who lived through this time speak-each segment usually introduced by a Historian who explains what happened. Adds a even more personal touch to this great show. Just buy it. Trust me,you won't regret it",1464480000,12,1718,4.73

8753526,3,B01CO70KX8,"This was a wonderful series until around the middle of Season 3, when everything, the plots, the charters, the storyline all begin to unravel.  The holes in the plots are so huge, they're impossible to dismiss.
For example, it's not believable that Mrs. Larcher would have been set free, even with the support of a French official, at the train station while about to board a train with Jews bound for a concentration camp.  She has just impersonated a Jewish woman and allowed her to escape, an unforgivable crime that the Nazzis would not have simply forgiven. Yet she goes right back home with no consequences.  Also how could Rita's mother have known that detective Marchetti betrayed her and sent her to a concentration camp? There was no way she could have found this out.
Another huge hole for me was the episode in which Raoul, Marie's son manages to obtain a radio tube needed for the operator to send messages to London, and coincidentally, the French police need THAT EXACT SAME MODEL of radio tube to listen to a radio transmission. Ok, that could have been a coincidence, but after Marie warns her son for security reasons, not to go see the girl who gave him the tube, that they will telephone the girl first, he goes to see her anyway, is observed by detective Marchetti, and the other French cops, who then conveniently lose track of him. There's no follow up on this. Marie never even asks her son what became of the girl who gave him the tube.  In a village as small as Villeneuve the police could have tracked down a kid like Raoul in a matter of minutes, especially after observing him for hours right outside Marie (his mother's) farmhouse.
Then there's the plot line of evil Gestapo officer Heinrich Muller returning from Russia, and being reassigned again to the town of Villaneuve... ok I guess that might have happened... but his trying to entice Mrs. Larcher back into his arms by describing a scene in which he massacres a whole Jewish family just doesn't cut it.  Did the writers want to imply that this gruesome story would be a turn on for her?  Of were they trying to imply that by telling it, he was threatening her?  It's not clear.  In any case, there don't seem to be any negative consequences for Mrs. Larcher when she turns him down and goes back home.
The final hole for me (around episode 9) comes up when Sarah, the Jewish girl who is having a torrid love affair with Dr. Larcher, returns to the house and finds he is back with his wife.  Ok, fine... those things happen. But in this series, Dr. Larcher's coldness and cruelty don't match the character we've seen consistently during all the previous episodes.  The hot passion he was feeling for Sarah is not only suddenly erased, but he also seems angry with her, even starts treating her like the maid she used to be, asking her to go make coffee!
These are just some of the deficiencies which crop up in season 3, that sadly is no match to the production values and story line quality of seasons 1 and 2.",1529712000,,2998,4.535185185185185
