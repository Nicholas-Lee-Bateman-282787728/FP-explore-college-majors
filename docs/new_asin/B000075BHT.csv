7974010,5,B000075BHT,The fact that she talks openly about the Spiritual aspects of belly dance is one of my favorite things about her.  She is a very good dancer and an excellent teacher!,1328832000,,166,4.354838709677419
7974011,4,B000075BHT,"Amora Mor is a real Bellydancer, wonderful teacher, she knows how to teach beginners, if you look for quality content not just fancy scenary this is for you.",1172275200,,157,4.642857142857143
7974012,5,B000075BHT,"'Belly Dance Your Way To Fitness' by Amira Mor is the first instructional video I bought six months ago when I started taking belly dance lessons. It is very helpful and provides reassurance to the beginner that the moves which seem very difficult and complicated, can be mastered ""with practice.""  Belly Dance can be highly liberating to those of us who have grown up doing aerobic and isometric exercises.  This truly is a feminine art and Ms. Mor conveys its spirit beautifully.  Buy it and you will refer to it again and again even when you move into intermediate status, as a basic refresher.  It is cheesy in some places but, so what?  Cheesy is appropriate when you are taking baby steps.  It goes that much further in making the intimidating seem approachable.",1151712000,,768,4.7368421052631575
7974013,3,B000075BHT,"The video is not the highest quality production.  The lighting isn't that great.  It looks like a third world professional wedding video.  I'm not being sarcastic, I have watched enough of those to know.  Anyway, Amira does wear a really revealing costume as one other reviewer pointed out.  I disagree that she is talentless.  I think she is very natural and a very good dancer.  She covers basic movements in this video and separates into upper body, lower body, and walking movements.  She has a group of about 4-6 students behind her.  They are also wearing the same outfit as Amira, but in blue and there seems to be more fabric on their costumes.

There is a section at the end where she creates a short choreography based on the moves she taught and then there is a strange freaky freestyle dance ""party"" with her and her students.  It looks like something out of a 60s b- horror movie, except the women are wearing bellydancing costumes not hot pants.

If you know how to do hip circles, umis, chest lifts /drops, hip lifts/drops, snakes arms and a basic walk with hip lifts/drops, then this will be too basic for you.  If you have no experience at all, then you can pick up some moves. At about 1 hour long, you get a lot of information.",1144022400,3,1246,4.484444444444445
7974014,5,B000075BHT,"This is a wonderful teaching tool.  I own several belly dancing teaching DVDs and this is by far the best.  Ms. Mor makes you feel as if she is right there in your home, you would swear she is speaking directly to you.  The moves are explained very well, in such a way that you feel you *can* do this, even when you feel clumsy at first.  It is the most comprehensive DVD I have seen, when you are through you will have all the basics down and then some.  Ms. Mor is very encouraging, understanding first the frustration  and and then the elation when it comes together for you.  I highly recommend it for all beginner and intermediate dancers!",1035849600,23,644,4.316666666666666
