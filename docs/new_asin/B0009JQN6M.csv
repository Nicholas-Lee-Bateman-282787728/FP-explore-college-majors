before bedtime.",1116460800,2,132,5.0
2295615,5,B0009JQN6M,"I agree that it is a crime that they haven't put ""The Nanny"" on DVD sooner.  I am so excited.  This show will appeal to anybody.  Fran and Mr. Sheffields' relationship is quite humorous.  You know that they will end up together, but you cant wait to see how.  Frankly, i love the butler, Niles. The bantering back and forth between him and Cece is hilarious.  Their contempt for each other is so obvious.  His comments are witty and seem to come spare of the moment, which makes it all the better.  Can't wait to own it.",1115683200,6,520,4.288659793814433
2295616,5,B0009JQN6M,"I have been a Nanny fan for years I even attempted to tape each episode from the 6 years.  Not to say I watch it everyday on lifetime and my husband laughs at me when I say the lines!  We love it...he has been looking and searching for when it will finally be released on DVD and that day is coming soon...Tomorrow is my birthday and this is the best present ever!  You will absolutely love her and the cast, as there is such chemistry between all of them.  She is the Lucy of the 90's and we all know how great she is!  Thank you!",1115251200,11,531,3.9716981132075473
2295617,5,B0009JQN6M,"It is criminal that ""The Nanny"" has not been released on DVD earlier!! This is the only show on television that has consistantly made me ""laugh out loud"". The current crop of TV ""comedies"" like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" make me smirk sometimes...but that's it. ""The Nanny"" is a hands-down crowd pleaser. Everywhere you go people can find something to relate to in this series. Whether it be the slow romance that develops between Fran and Mr Sheffield. Or the unbelievably wacky family members we all are afraid to admit we have! Either way, The 1st Season of ""The Nanny"" is very cute and lays down the groundwork for future character developments. Personally I feel the funniest episodes are in seasons 2 and 3...but having season 1 on DVD will have to do for now!

Fran Drescher is a glamourous and classy lady and this TV series shows her true comedy stylings and sophistication! Fun for the whole family!",1115251200,8,908,4.746835443037975

Fran is sexy and doesn't mind showing off that hot body...as we all know she did end up gaining back her weight and I always wondered how she could nosh the way she did and still remain in that size 2?  well as seasons past by we saw the skirts get longer and shirts not so tight... she got cancer while doing the series.

2295657,3,B0009JQN6M,"This 1993-94 Season of this one-of-a-kind sitcom about a warm-hearted, nasal-voiced nanny from Queens, Fran Fine(Fran Drescher) who lands a job caring for 3 children of a wealthy, widowed Broadway producer from Manhattan.

During the show's 6-year run on CBS, Drescher dazzles in this role she created and developed as writer and producer in several episodes & obviously relishes, whether she's flirting, whining, sparring, or showcasing her sensational wardrobe and immediate chemistry between Nanny Fine and Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) fuels the storylines while the sarcastic repartee of Sheffield's assistant, C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane) and Niles the Butler (Daniel Davis) further ignites the entertainment.

This Freshmen Season of the show highlights include ""The Butler, the Husband, the Wife, and Her Mother,"" when the family enters a parallel universe in a hilarious turn of events; and ""Imaginary Friend,"" this 1993-1994 Season's turning point where Drescher's physical comedy that was inspired by the late great Lucille Ball is given free reign.

Celebrity guests stars  include Carol Channing, Cloris Leachman, and Patti LaBelle, so don't miss the bonus material: a heartwarming ""making-of"" retrospective with the cast, and Drescher's audio commentary during ""I Don't Remember Mama."" Mild profanity and sexual innuendo. (Ages 12 and older).

Additionally, it will be nice being able to see this show complete & uncut as well as commercial free without all those deleted scenes you got on this show when it was shown in reruns on Lifetime, TV Land, and Antenna-TV.",1397779200,,1587,5.541322314049586

2295675,5,B0009JQN6M,"The Nanny Overall Review: I felt that it was a very funny show. I love the way that Niles is always shutting up CC. I think that, now that I am older, the relationship between Max and Fran didn't blossom as quickly as it feels like it did in the show, which was more true to how it would have happened in real life, and I find that very satisfying now that I am in my 20's. No matter how many times I watch it, I still find myself laughing at the jokes because they never seem to get old.

The DVD Collection Review: I liked the way these discs were done. They were typical, three disc, two cases, classical binding, not the fold open kind that I find annoying.

Episode Reviews

""The Pilot"" I thought this episode was very funny and it caught my attention. The jokes were not as good as they are later in the series, and the house and clothing isn't as great, but it was a great start to the series.

""Smoke Gets in Your Lies"" I found most of the jokes, post caught smoking, the funniest. The clothing in this episode wasn't the best in the series, but it was true to the time.

""My Fair Nanny"" This episode was entertaining, it was filled with nothing but joke after joke. The parody on ""My Fair Lady"" was very classic, they even talk about the marbles. The writer of this episode did an amazing job with a modern re-telling.

""The Nuchshlep"" I found this a very funny episode, it reminded me of the first time I ever went out on a date, only I was a double date not a Nuchshlep. The jokes and the clothing was nice in this episode, along with the overall story arc

""Here Comes the Brood"" The dress Fran has to wear is the funniest thing I have ever seen, she looks like Princess Peach in a cheesy live-action Mario, almost like an 80's flick. The jokes were somewhat funny in this episode, however, the storyline was the charming part, and heart warming. The song the little boy sings gets stuck in your head, just a warning.

""The Butler, the Husband, the Wife, and her Mother"" This was my least favorite episode. I didn't like the storyline, the jokes, or the overall theme of this episode. The idea that a mother only finds her child worth something if she gets married and has children is upsetting.

""Imaginary Friend"" This was a pleasantly funny episode, but the way they talk about therapy wasn't very PC. I really don't understand why Gracie is in therapy, I mean many kids lose a parent and go on to live happy, normal lives without therapy.

""The Christmas Show"" This episode was very typical of Christmas stories, Santa coming through with the impossible at the last moment. It was a bit cheesy, though. The clothing was too season and festive, and the ideals behind bouncing checks and charities over family weren't pleasant. I couldn't understand why Fran and the children didn't go to the charity with their father, they would have had Fran to watch them.

""Personal Business"" I couldn't stop laughing that they had ""Patch"" from days of our life on the show, and the ""Patch"" jokes they made in the show. The way they talk about Soap Operas seems so true, they are drama at its best. Fran's clothing is amazing in this episode, and did I mention I loved see, Patch, LOL. Seriously, the episode as a whole was one of my favorites, great clothing, good story, fun jokes (the hand motion one is the best), and special, sexy guest stars. Fun for all!

""The Nanny-In-Law"" I wasn't fond of this episode, though it was funny and the clothing was great, I couldn't get over Nanny Muller. I like to watch sitcoms to unwind and escape real life and her nanny was just like my grandmother, and although I love my grandmother she isn't funny and she is real life so that destroyed the un-real fantasy of the sitcom that I was seeking. Besides, they make you want to hate Nanny Muller and it made me feel a little like they were attacking my grandmother and that upset me because I'm protective of my loved ones.

""A Plot For Nanny"" This episode was very funny, mostly the conversation about ""the talk"" that happened with Max and Fran. The clothing was great, and it was, what I felt, was the first time Max and Fran started to have a sexual/romantic chemistry build.  The jokes were very funny as well.

""The Show Must Go On"" This episode was funny in many respects, but in others it was upset. I work in show-business, Indie Productions that is, and it isn't about who you know in the Indie world, and I wouldn't cast a family member over someone with obvious talent. I thought that way he treated the children was unreasonable in many respects, but also, that if it were a real production and not a school one that the way he treated them was very true to real-life Broadway.

""Maggie the Model"" I really hated Chloe Simpson. I really just downright hated her. I couldn't get into the episode because her character made my skin crawl so much. It wasn't on the top of my good episodes list.

""The Family Plumbing"" It was an okay episode. However, the jokes weren't the best and the little girl's voice drills into your brain. I wasn't a fan of the episode as a whole. The best thing to come out of it was the joke about 14 year old boys, I use it often, other than that this episode was a plain-blaw wash.

""Deep Throat"" It was a funny episode, especially the end of the episode. It was also the first time that you knew Max loved Fran because he chose her over CC

""Schlepped Away"" This episode was extremely funny, from the food jokes to the family jokes.

""Stop the Wedding, I Want to Get Off"" The fashion of this episode was too die for. I loved it so much. The dress Fran wears to the wedding is amazing. The idea of falling in love with someone of another class is classic and fun. The way the nanny handled it was great.

""Sunday in the Park with Fran"" I wanted to kill that child, or, at the very least, put him over my knee and spank him. The episode was funny, but Frank Sr. was a horrible father and I wanted him to get over himself.

""The Gym Teacher"" It was a funny episode, I had gym teachers in middle school I felt that way about. I loved my high school gym teacher though, she was great

""Ode to Barbara Joan"" The Bob Mackie dress was amazing, I wish he still did gowns like that all the time. The jokes were funny, and the number of Barbara fan stuff they made up.

""Frannie's Choice"" I wasn't a fan of this episode, it came across as lust and horniness is a good reason to consider marriage.

""I Don't Remember Mama"" This was such a sad episode, and the way the children in the pageant acted, and the mothers, that was tame compared to the mothers in the pageants I was in as a child.",1377475200,2,6609,4.331983805668016

2295679,5,B0009JQN6M,"A native New Yorker born and bred and from the sleeper Borough of Queens myself, I have to admit that I love this show, though bits about big hair and her voice are way over the top, yes exaggerated for those whom never have been to New York City before. The parts with the loud talking, interrupting and slapping each other are so New York city. If you need a laugh a minute this is the show to watch. It is otherwise so New York city. It is hilarious. Now mind you, I never viewed this show when it first aired. I have no idea why, except that I wasn't watching TV at the time this aired. I'm now working my way through the DVD series. Where was I when this shirt first aired? Fran Drescher is just too funny.
Overall, this is a wonderful series for the entire family too watch and grown up enough for just adults.",1373587200,,816,4.138364779874214

It's great to see it from start to finish even though it's a sitcom there are plot arcs best watched in order. Sadly, only the first half of the series has been released with the rest not coming any time soon.
As for the DVD, there aren't a lot of special features but the commentaries with Fran are good enough, even though there's only two.",1371513600,,425,4.195121951219512

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Jewish Yiddish sayings and New York Jewish satirical humor. Fran Drescher and the whole cast do an excellent job of entertaining us. Make sure to get the rest of the seasons. So far I've only been able to get the first three seasons.

Granted, Fran Drescher's voice is an acquired taste, but since I am originally from the New York Metro Area, she reminds me of so many women from Queens, the other four boroughs, and especially Long Island. I wish they had all of the seasons on DVD, but I am glad that they have at least the first few seasons available. If you have never watched any episodes, give it a try. What do you have to lose?",1282435200,,530,4.105769230769231
2295720,4,B0009JQN6M,"I purchased this product as part of a home-administered hearing test I wanted to perform on my wife and dog. Neither of them seemed to listen to a word I said; I could yammer on until I was blue in the uvula, with no response. Nothing but blank stares. So I decided to find out whether they'd actually gone clinically deaf or had just learned to tune me out, by making a series of loud and annoying noises and monitoring their responses.

You can ignore most of the people some of the time, and some of the people most of the time -- and me, apparently, ALL of the time -- but nobody can ignore Fran Drescher in The Nanny. I'm not sure how anyone on the set could be within fifty yards without throttling the 'HEEENH-EH-EH-EH-HEH!' out of her, but that's another matter. I just needed to know if the people around me could still hear her.

I waited for a nice quiet evening at home, with the wife, dog and I gathered around the TV for a relaxing bit of entertainment. But instead of our usual light and breezy fare -- one of the CSIs, perhaps, or 24, or Law & Order: Gory Murder Squad -- I slipped in The Nanny on DVD, and waited for a reaction. It didn't take long.

Thirty seconds in, the dog started howling like a set of asthmatic bagpipes. I'm pretty sure my wife was moaning in agony through the 'What hath thou wrought?' look she shot me next, but all I could hear at that point was that impossibly nasal Drescher laugh, piercing my eardrums like the sharp twin stilettos of a gum-smacking Queens call girl. We lay writhing and keening in the floor for what seemed like hours, until finally -- mercifully -- something popped. And I couldn't hear anything at all. That was a week ago.

So now I know that my wife and dog could hear all along; they were just ignoring me. And now my eardrums have exploded, and they think I'm ignoring THEM. Outstanding.",1279584000,15,1858,4.330459770114943
2295721,4,B0009JQN6M,"When the Nanny was showing, apparently I had something to do with my life and never watched it.  Now, older and bored, I discovered the Nanny through Nick at Night.  Nick at Night shows about 3 episodes at a time late at night so I became addicted to the show.  Netflix didn't have the DVDs so I decided to purchase the early episodes to better understand what was going on.

The first season is very funny and what I really liked about the first season is that it explained to me how the kids blossomed under the care of someone that allowed them to be fun and creative.  Maggie went from a boring amish like girl to a boy crazy popular girl who is now confident.  Brighton went from a little boy looking for attention to a boy who likes to be funny and recognizes that his older sister is an asset rather than a liability.  Gracie went from a little 8 year old feeling empty, alone, and deserted without a therapist to a sparkling little girl who is funny and confident.

Even though the show was a comedy, it shows how your upbringing has a lot to do with your personality.  Without Fran, the kids would have likely ended up rich loners.  Look at the backgrounds of many of the heiresses and many of them died alone because they were only able to socialize with society people and not ordinary people.

Anyway, the only problems I had with the first season are as follows:

1. CC's character is overbearing and NEVER has been funny throughout the shows entire run.
2. Niles' character was funny and loveable and in the first season this wasn't fully developed.
3. Fran's lipstick was too dark for her skin tone; she was goth but the lipstick was too much and way too dark.
4. Fran's jeans were too high waisted.
5. Maggie's stockings are too white; unfortunately, she wore these same stockings for the entire run of the show.",1276992000,2,1828,4.423880597014925

The kids are adorable, especially Grace, who talks back with an attitude. Every once in a while when I watch ""The Nanny"" I find myself bursting with laughter.

Unfortunately, the show didn't get much attention when it was on. Some of its cultural references are outdated (frequent references to the Clintons and Dolly Parton). However, if you didn't catch it while it was being aired, these DVDs are definitely worth checking out.",1263168000,,726,5.0

Recently, I'd been catching bits and pieces of it on Nick at Nite (which makes me feel pretty old).  When I looked up the season set on Amazon, I couldn't believe the ridiculously low price, so I bit.

The show suffers from the problem all shows have, working through the first couple of episodes--introducing characters and plot, finding its voice.  But it is a very quick affliction.  By episode three or so, the show was great.  I found myself laughing out loud.  The writing is wonderful, and the cast has good chemistry.

2295727,5,B0009JQN6M,"The Nanny is the funniest of all comedies for me. The humor is so much witty, unique, original and heart-warming. It's a classic story about a low class woman falling into the lives of a rich elite family. The twists to this classic story makes it very hilarious and exciting - the ""Queens/Jewish"" cultural background of the nanny, the Broadway musical career of the producer widowed father, the wittiness of the repressed butler and the outrageous wickedness of the producer's assistant that always gets overthrown by the butler.

The audio commentary of Fran Drescher on season 1 episodes gives small interesting trivias to the tv show. It proves that this was not just a regular tv show project but was very near and dear to Fran in real life, because of how much she and her team brought into it from who she is, her family and close friends.

I cannot wait for the whole tv series to be completed in DVD. To Sony Pictures, please make the succeeding dvd seasons more exciting with additional special features.",1244419200,,1014,4.72316384180791

There quickly becomes a sexual attraction between Sheffield and Fran that they deny. There is Max's business associate CC Babcock and the butler Niles that are always wisecracking back and forth. The kids are very withdrawn and trouble makers because they have no one to teach them to grow up. So Fran steps in and fills the gapa in the hearts and their lives.

2295751,5,B0009JQN6M,"The Nanny just gets better and better.  You feel as if the characters are real, and being a former New Yorker, I have known many Frans and Maxwells and Sylvias and Morty's and on and on.  Watching The Nanny brings me home again.",1155168000,4,228,4.27906976744186
2295752,4,B0009JQN6M,"There is hardly a thing to say about ""The Nanny"" that hasn't been said before, so I will make it short. This is one of the greatest sitcoms of the 1990s. It has a great cast - the devious Lauren Lane, the Butler Niles, the yummy Charles Shaughnessy, adorable children and of course - Fran Drescher!!! This is her show and what is not to like. She is goodlooking, funny and even her voice suits her. It is NOT obnoxious at all. For me it was a great pleasure to finally hear the ""correct"" voice as in Germany every show is dubbed and some of its originality is lost.

If you had a bad day this show is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud, no matter how much gloom is there. It is ALWAYS a pick-me-up. And even after repeated viewing it is not losing its edge. It is a jewel and I hope they continue to release the latter seasons, although in my opinion the earlier ones are the best.

If you like ""Golden Girls"", ""Friends"", ""The Cosby Show"" or ""Who's the Boss?"", ""THE NANNY"" is THE show for you.

The reason I gave this DVD Box just 4 stars is simple - there should have been more Extras like Bloopers or Interviews.

The show itself gets 5 stars.",1154736000,6,1148,4.180995475113122
2295753,5,B0009JQN6M,"Fran Drescher is a natural comedian.  There isn't any time within the 6-year history of this show where she even has to try being funny.  The most obvious thing about her humor is what a beautiful woman she is, and then she opens her mouth to reveal that voice.  OY!!!  This TV show is part My Fair Lady, part I Love Lucy, and part Pretty Woman.  Mix well, add a great bunch of supporting actors, and you have one of the best TV sitcoms to come along in years.

Honestly, how many wealthy people would even consider a gorgeous woman dressed in tight mini skirts with a Queens accent to watch their kids?  Here is where the aspects of Pretty Woman and My Fair Lady come into play.  It's Fran's family and her best friend Val--physical comedy a-plenty--that show the true Lucy and Ethel spirit of this show.  Despite all Fran's shortcomings with Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy), there is still a romance blooming between the two from episode one.  Her alliance with Niles the butler(Daniel Davis) against self-centered neurotic nemesis C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane) is pure fun, and the later inclusion of Fran's cute little pomeranian Chester conspire for hours (in fact, years) of fun.

Fran proves herself, though not your typical agency hire-ee, to be a caring and loving aid in raising Maxwell's three children, the funniest of them being Brighton (Benjamin Salisbury), but her husband and crew worked very hard to give us a half-decade of one of the funniest, sharp-witted, and most enjoyable shows on television in the last 20 years.",1151971200,3,1543,4.806818181818182

She is really hillarious and I love the show. The DVD collection comes with comments by Fran and I love it. I think she really describes the show well, and her fans.

Also, it is nice to learn what has been going on with the rest of the cast. I miss this show, it was such an important part of my TV watching life for so many years. Having the DVD allows me to remember those days and play all over again my favorite episodes.

Now, I am looking forward to seeing the show over and over again.",1149465600,4,628,3.8984375

2295762,5,B0009JQN6M,"Great show, SO SO FUNNY!  I bought this one based on reviews-- they were correct.  Each episode is so fresh and light and GUARANTEED to make you smile.  Fran is a nanny from Queens, NY, (accent, mannerisms, quite cute and honest in feelings), who lives with a British family with butler in Manhattan.  All characters interact SO nicely-- excellent British wittiness matched with American humor. Nice!!!!

Case: GREAT, easy to remove DVDs.  All cases should be like this.  Single-sided disks mean less problems for kids (and adults too) to handle.

Episodes: seem to be uncut and roughly 25 minutes long.  Each one that I have seen (1-10) is so well done and original.

Extras: they are there.  The commentary is also nice.  HOWEVER, I wish that there were ENGLISH SUBTITLES as only Spanish and French are available.  Please provide ENGLISH SUBTITLES that allow people with hearing impairments to enjoy the series AND also for NON-NATIVE speakers to learn.

Overall, this series is VERY NICE for the entire family.  Highly recommended and the price ($20) is right.",1141430400,3,1063,4.9602272727272725

It took a long time coming and I'm sure other Nanny fans like I can't wait for Season 2 to be released. This is the best sitcom show ever. Fran Drescher is absolutely charming, beautiful and funny! This set features the first 22 episodes. The show is hilarious!! I've never watched one episode that didn't have me laughing in stitches. The cast is absolutely fabulous. Charles Shaughnessy who plays Mr. Sheffield is so charming and just right for the part. The butler, Niles, played by Daniel Davis is halarious and adds so much to the show with his constant insults to C.C.( Lauren Lane ). The 3 children were perfectly casted along with Renee Taylor who plays Fran's mother, and we can't forget grandma Yetta who's senile remarks make her a great compliment to the show. We are fortunate that the Lifetime Network still airs The Nanny reruns daily! For any Nanny fans who have not purchased this DVD set, it is well worth the money to own it! You will watch it over and over again because after all, who can say I have enough of that show? Fran Drescher rocks as the sexy, street smart,beautiful and halarious nanny!!! Too bad the show ended after only 6 seasons but hopefully we fans can look forward to owning all 6 seasons one day! She had style, she had flare, she was there, that's how she became The Nanny!

2295768,4,B0009JQN6M,"This show literally is on six times a day where I live but I still can't get enough.  So, I was very excited to purchase the first season on DVD and for the most part I was not disappointed.  The DVD makes it possible for me to have a Fran fix whenever I need it.

Watching through the episodes sequentially you can see that it really does not take long for the show to settle into its rhythm.  The first two episodes or so were somewhat surprising to me, as Mr. Sheffield was quite distant from his children.  But by the third or fourth episode everyone seems to have warmed up and the Fran-Max chemistry has already kicked in.

Perhaps the most endearing part of this show is that for me Fran and her family remind me of my relatives who lived in New York and Jersey City.  Here I would add that this is a testimony to the Nanny's universal appeal, because I myself am neither Jewish nor a New Yorker but still can relate with nearly every depticion of Fran's old neighborhood, relatives,  and friends.

The extras are limited and somewhat repetitive.  The interviews focus primarily on Drescher (who frequently uses the phrase ""my husband"") and Jacobson (who uses the phrase ""Fran"").  There are quick snippets from Madeline Zima, Benjamin ..er .., and Anne Guilbert.  Lauren Lane (C.C.), Daniel Davis (Niles) and Charles Shaughnessy (Max) are regrettably missing.",1136678400,4,1366,4.645833333333333

As a girl, I suppose I was always a little more interested in her clothes and hair, but I always laughed through this.  Nothing was funnier than the digs between CC and Niles and the sexual tension between Fran and Maxwell.  The kids roles were bordering dull and boring, but the show overall was fantastic.  If you can get over the fact that someone on her characters wage couldn't probably afford those clothes (without a trust fund), then you'll love this.  If anyone has written anything bad about her nasal voice, ignore it.  It was part of what made her unique and different.  Go get this now.  Everyone will love it.

The only thing that i am sad about is that they took it off the air when they did if they can keep friends on the air for 10 years im sure they could of found a way to keep the nanny on air for a few more seasons and im also sad that we couldn't see their life in california as it would have been fun to see fran juggling twins and gracie becoming a teenager and niles and cc with their married life.

I don't get to see her new sitcome but we nanny fans need another reunion with them in character and picking up from california.

The DVD's are lovely packed, with a tigerprint-print on the discs' surface, just to campy!! I also liked the quality of the video, it's great. It's never blurry of blocky, which makes it much much better quality than the ""Will and Grace""-DVD's. Then, on several episodes of the series, there's audio-commentary by Fran Drescher herself and she's so charming and lovely. The little things she tells about the episode makes it just more interesting to watch! So, everything about this set is great:

the package, the extra's, the quality of the images and of course the series itself. It's still going strong and it never bores. I've seen this serie for the third or fourth time and it still makes me laugh! I think ""The Nanny"" is one of the better sit-coms ever been on television!

It's a reflex for me to have that undivided attention whenever I have the chance to watch The Nanny episodes on cable. Usually in hallmark channel. A truly comic relief from all the hustle and bustle of  my sometimes mundane sometimes stressful life.

The only problem is Im craving for all the other season which I wasn't able to watch unfortunately. If not for those wonderful The nanny websites I wouldnt know that it lasted for 6 years. Im not surprise Im overwhelmed cause its so rare that great sitcoms like these knowing theres a lot of detractors survive. Im greatful for all the fans who helped this sitcom made it through. You all have wonderful taste for comedy. Its frustrating to realized I missed the juicy and interesting episodes but I won't be broken hearted no more for I have hope. The first season started it all. It was the best ever, an eye and attention catcher that made me and my heart laugh out loud. I mean literally. Hail to the TPTB for coming into their senses.

That aside, 'The Nanny' is an uber funny show. A jewish girl from queens who is a door-to-door make-up sales woman ends up as the nanny to a the family of a rich, british, broad-way producer widower.

This seasons only gets 5 stars because the show gets better yet in season five when *SPOILER* Fran and Mr. Sheffield get married */SPOILER*.

Of course, the shows trademark humor based on the clashing of Fran and the Sheffields cultures, loads of innuendo, the sexual tension between Fran and her boss, and, best of all, Niles and C.C.'s constant fueding, which will pay off big time in season 6.

2295810,5,B0009JQN6M,"Fran Drescher's career-making sitcom THE NANNY finally comes to DVD with this well-produced box set of the first season.  Fran Fine (Fran Drescher) is a door-to-door cosmetics salesgirl from Queens who unwittingly becomes nanny to the children of rich Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy).  As confidante to shy Maggie (Nicolle Tom), mischevious Brighton (Benjamin Salisbury) and junior couch-case Gracie (Madeline Zima), Fran discovers a whole new way of life, living in ritzy Manhattan and meeting the famous celebrities Max hires to star in his various shows.

Bringing Fran back to real life - and always there for a helping hand - is Max's deadpan butler Niles (Daniel Davis), along with her mother Sylvia (Renee Taylor), Grandma Yetta (Ann Guilbert) and best friend Val (Rachel Chagall).  And there's also Max's frosty business associate CC Babcock (Lauren Lane) who is noticing the growing attraction between Max and Fran...and is as jealous as hell!

The first season of THE NANNY perfectly sets up the premise and the main characters.  Classic eps include ""Smoke Gets in Your Lies"" where Fran catches Brighton smoking, and introduces him to her chain-smoking Grandma Yetta as a warning; ""The Nuchshlep"" where Fran becomes the third wheel in Maggie's lovelife; ""Imaginary Friend"" where Fran accidentally eats Gracie's imaginary buddy Imogene; ""The Nanny-in-Law"" where Max's childhood Nanny Mueller (Cloris Leachman) visits, gets Fran's blood boiling...and gets Niles hot under the collar;  and ""The Gym Teacher"" where Fran confronts her sadistic former gym instructor Miss Wickervich (Rita Moreno).

Select episodes also feature audio commentary from the always-delightful Fran Drescher.  THE NANNY was and remains a very popular sitcom, and now the first season is on DVD, hopefully more volumes are set to follow.

""The Butler, the Husband, the Wife and Her Mother"" - Sylvia lies to her snooty cousin Marsha, and tells her that Fran and Max are married.

The episodes are great of course, picture and sound are top-notch, of course no commercials is nice too! The cast had a great chemistry instantly, my fave episodes are ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"", ""Ode to Barbra Joan"" and ""I Don't Remember Mama"".

She had style, she had flair, she was there, that's how she became the nanny.""

In case you haven't already clicked, I had just typed out that most part of the beginning theme to 'The Nanny' - and that's exactly how the story was set. A make-up seller ends up at the door of a Broadway producer and becomes the nanny for his 3 children. The English producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessey, Days Of Our Lives) hates Andrew Llyodd Webber, and is known to say ""I love you"" before taking it straight back, again.

He has his faithful butler, Niles (Daniel Davis), and his arch-enemy and Maxwell's associate, Chastity-Claire Babcock (Lauren Lane) - these two are known for their sniping remarks and catty coments. Fran helps the three kids Maggie, Brighton and Gracie (Nicole Tom, Beethoven; Benjamin Salisbury and Madeline Zima, Mr. Nanny) through boyfriends, girlfriends and the usual teenage stuff.

I am so excited to be able to pay a few bucks and get the professionally produced versions.  HIP, HIP, HOORAY! I TOO HOPE SONY RELEASES ALL 6 SEASONS QUICKLY.  Now, if only the new Living With Fran would reunite all the cast members from The Nanny. The new show just doesn't have the same allure. The Nanny casting was absolutely brilliant. I say bring them back together and take us into life with the ""old"" married couple, picking up with the birth of the Sheffield twins, Fran's transition from Nanny to Stepmom, and the traumatic move to California.",1118707200,,835,4.597315436241611

2295827,5,B0009JQN6M,"Man I love this show.  My wife and I watch it three or four times a day in syndication and we never get tired of it.  The Nanny and her lively downtown Brooklyn lifestyle meets her employers proper English household and the clashes were only overshadowed by the laughs.

They came from different worlds in every way - social but they found lots in common including love for the three kids and for each other.  It was a great series.",1118707200,,432,4.3625
2295828,5,B0009JQN6M,"I am so thrilled for Fran Dresher and for myself. I really love the show. I can watch reruns over and over again. Fran has made me laugh on days when I was really down.  This DVD collection was way overdue.

Can you imagine they put Kristie Allies show on DVD before the NANNY!! Now something is wrong with that picture. It took a long time but FRAN is well worth it. Good for you FRAN!! You go girl!!

So many people I know ask how I can stand watching 10 episodes in one day and I tell them I just can't get enough of Fran Drescher's voice. Its just so adorable, how can you resist?! And her laugh! I just die when I hear it! If it were possible, I would have a reconstructive voice surgery so I could sound like her. Best. Show. Ever.",1118361600,2,491,4.178947368421053

2295831,5,B0009JQN6M,It's about time that they brought The Nanny out on DVD. It is the funniest sitcom that ever hit TV. Fran Drescher and the entire cast made watching so enjoyable that I couldn't wait until the next episode. My only regret is that they are binging out one season at a time. I'm ready to buy all 6 seasons now. I'm sure that there are a lot more fans like myself who would do the same thing. Can hardly wait until I have the first season in my hands. Great show.,1117324800,104,459,4.054945054945055

2295833,5,B0009JQN6M,"I'm so glad to have The Nanny now on DVD. My wife and I watched it when we first got married and it sort of became our sitcom. I was so frustrated when it ended and it was ""deliberately"" forgotten on the EMMYs that year. They showed mostly Mad About You clips. I really felt sorry for Miss Drescher for all her effort to put the show on the air all those years. But now as I read the reviews for this DVD collection, and it's not even out yet, I am glad to see that the public - Fans! - did not forget a sitcom that served its purpose: ""made us, once a week, feel at Home!""",1116979200,3,573,3.864406779661017
