4156773,5,B003ND0AXS,How fun! My son has been waiting for this to come out since it debuted last year - thank you for the fun times ahead!,1286668800,,117,3.72
4156774,5,B003ND0AXS,"Disney seriously needs to get their act together and get old more DVDs and Cds for Phineas and Ferb.

The show is hilarious for adults and children with plenty of Pop culture references (Star Wars, LOTR, Wizard of Oz), but no stupid humor like Spongebob.  Poop and fart jokes are fine, but the humor of P & F is sophisticated without alienating it's audience.  The show is also very low on violence, which is refreshing nowadays.  Even a big bully beat down turns out to be a thumb wrestling match.

The music in each episode is fantastic.  So much that I have a 45 song CD in the car that I listen to even when my daughter isn't with me.

This particular DVD is great with lots of fun extras.  Any fan of the show will be pleased.",1286236800,23,731,4.246376811594203

This is a nice Christmas episode and the boys watched it daily through the holidays.

Even though the whole DVD is considered Christmas, and all of the ending credits are the Christmas theme, only the first episode is Christmas.

------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fun TV series, but it's too bad that Disney only has a handful of episodes available on DVD. We don't get cable, so for us it sure would be nice if they'd put out full ""Season One"" and ""Season Two"" collections, rather than just these semi-random DVD releases with only five episodes per disc. Sigh. I'm sure they'll get around to it someday in the distant future, but my kid'll have outgrown the show by then.  That being said, this disc includes the Christmas special, which includes one of Dr. Doofenschmirtz's best songs, ""Tell Me Why I Don't Hate Christmas,"" which is ""Phineas And Ferb"" at its best!  (Axton)",1294876800,,726,5.041666666666667
4156879,5,B003ND0AXS,"The Christmas special is the 2010 extended version.  I fell in love with this special in 2009 with the first version and so this DVD became a must have.  I also enjoyed the other Perry-centric episodes on it, plus the Virtual Fireplace special feature.  I thought I wouldn't care about it, but it was a fun version of it so I found myself putting it on and watching it all the way through a couple of times during the season.",1294272000,11,425,4.2875
4156880,5,B003ND0AXS,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson, Corde' enjoys watching Phineas & Ferb. As soon as he hears the show begin, he says "" Nana come and sit"". He then climbs into my lap and we both enjoy the show together. It's wonderful being a grandparent, you truly understand how special little things really are.
Nana",1293753600,,294,4.363636363636363
4156881,5,B003ND0AXS,"If your kids enjoy Phineas and Ferb, then you've probably already seen this! It's a fun story where P&F save Christmas in Danville. Typical P&F humor, injected with hidden nuggets of adult humor. Of all the kid shows for 5 - 10(?)+, I can tolerate this show the best. Heinz Dufenshmirtz has the best lines. Fun for boys and girls.",1293148800,,330,4.516666666666667
4156882,2,B003ND0AXS,"I will echo some earlier sentiments and express my disappointment that there is nothing new to this DVD. It's great for any Phineas & Ferb fan, but I probably would not have bought it had it been clear that the Christmas episode is one my kids have seen a number of times. It really was marketed to come across as something all new. I was curious why the box didn't give a more detailed description of the Christmas show and this explains why; people would instantly recognize it's the same episode as seen on TV. Good DVD with a lot of bonus features, but Disney should be a little less ambiguous with their title releases.",1292976000,,624,4.434782608695652
4156883,4,B003ND0AXS,This DVD contains the Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation tv special from 2009.  It is a very entertaining special and additionally contains about 3 additional episodes of the tv show.  My 13 year old and 7 year old both love it and have watched it numerous times.,1290988800,,264,4.595744680851064
4156884,3,B003ND0AXS,"First, our son is only 4 but loves everything about this show - these characters are real to him. We assumed this would be a longer Christmas episode and while it was something new, the rest of the DVD was a number of the shows featuring Perry. I had really hoped for something new. We had also picked up a Christmas book and thought that may have been on this as well, but it wasn't. Our son also fixated on the opening credits for the Christmas special and was terribly upset that the actually story didn't contain a ""yeti"" - the book did. So one funny Christmas show and a lot of repeats of the regular old stuff. I would have thought Disney could have done this up a little better.",1290729600,3,685,4.236641221374046
4156885,1,B003ND0AXS,"We love Phineas and Ferb, but were very disappointed to find these were old already available episodes under a new name.  Only one was even Christmas themed.  Complete waste of money.",1290556800,6,183,4.870967741935484
4156886,5,B003ND0AXS,"Other reviewers are correct in noting that this DVD is made up of episodes and the Xmas specvial previously seen on the Disney Channel, and yes, I agree that it should not have been marketed as 'pre-order', as it could be expected to be new material. But, once you get past that confusion, it is a five star DVD, and any fan of this series will love it. My son especially liked the Xmas special in question, which is heavily layered with ""High School Musical"" type songs (Ashley Tinsdale, in fact, is on this disc), Phineas and Ferb saving Christmas for Danville and Perry The Platypus. There is also an extra episode, a virtual fireplace, a look behind the scenes of creating a P&F episode and so forth. Again, I do agree that it was marketed incorrectly, and so if you are Xmas shopping, make sure the recipient would want repeat eps (and there is nothing wrong with the DVD when it cuts to the next scene in a couple instances, repeating dialogue said before what was an original commercial break), and there should be no problem. Hopefully, next time Disney will be organized and upfront about their product so as to not scare off potential buyers!!!!",1290384000,5,1155,4.584541062801932

4156890,1,B003ND0AXS,"This item came available for pre-order which usually indicates a new release.  This is not, it's the Christmas episode from last year along with a few additional old episodes.  Nothing wrong with the episodes, the DVD was marketed in such a way as to give the impression of something new or previously unreleased, this is not the case.  However, if you don't already own it and/or just love these guys like we do by all means order it.",1287792000,10,435,4.551282051282051
4156891,5,B003ND0AXS,"ince 2007, ""Phineas and Ferb"" is an animated show that has been entertaining children on the Disney Channel with its running gags, interesting and hilarious characters.  With each episode, Phineas and Ferb are both working on a project and each time, their sister Candace is always scheming to finally bust them.  Meanwhile, the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz is up to no good and Major Monogram and the secret agent Perry the Platypus (Agent P) are doing all they can to stop Doofenshmirtz.

With the Christmas holiday season around the corner, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment is releasing ""Phineas and Ferb: A Very Perry Christmas"" featuring six episodes and plenty of special features.

""Phineas and Ferb: A Very Perry Christmas"" comes with the following episodes. Included are:

  * Phineas & Ferb Christmas Vacation (Season 2, Episode 84) - Dr. Doofenshmirtz wants to ruin the Christmas holiday for everyone.  Meanwhile, the boys and their friends try to save Christmas.

JUDGMENT CALL:

At our home, somehow ""Phineas and Ferb"" has become my 7-year-old son's favorite animated series.  Every day he watches the show and interesting enough, I can hear both he and my wife singing the show's theme song and even my wife has talked about how she enjoys watching ""Phines and Ferb"" alongside with him.

As for me, I knew nothing about the show and I felt like a kid asking my son many questions of who is that character and that character and what is the plot of the series?  So, this DVD was actually my first foray into the world of ""Phineas & Ferb"" and for my son, this DVD was in his words...""Awesome!"".

Because truthfully, I just thought it was a special Christmas episode and then when that episode was done, there were five more episodes to watch.  And then you get to the main menu and there are Easter Eggs hidden throughout the menu, special features and you get another bonus episode of ""Phineas and Ferb"", how cool is that?

Although, I may not have grasped the concept of why Phineas and Ferb's older sister Candace is trying to bust her little brothers or why there is a secret agent platypus, I realize that this series is beloved by many, and my young son and my wife are among that demographic who love this series so much that I hear them singing the theme song nearly daily.

The episodes I did watch were fun but of course, my son can probably give the best description of this DVD and he just had one word to describe this DVD and that was ""awesome""!

As a parent, the episodes were safe and fun to watch and I have to admit, for a children's DVD, Disney has definitely released an impressive package with six episodes of ""Phineas & Ferb"" and many special features to go along with this entire DVD.  I was very impressed by this DVD and I can definitely recommend this to parents or grandparents who want to keep their children entertained during the holiday season or a DVD for them to watch during those long holiday commutes.

Overall, this is a solid release of ""Phineas and Ferb"" which fans of the series can't go wrong with it and really, there is nothing I can even fault or say anything negative about because you get so much in this DVD release.  For fans of ""Phineas and Ferb"", ""Phineas and Ferb: A Very Perry Christmas"", my son gives this DVD five stars and a very big ""AWESOME!"".",1287619200,72,6330,4.72644098810613
4156892,5,B003ND0AXS,The Kids (and husband) love this dvd!!!  As you know Phineas and Ferb really is for both the kids and adults!,1287360000,,109,4.190476190476191
4156893,5,B003ND0AXS,"The creators of Phineas and Ferb have exactly what I always expected from watching the show --  a lot of creative freedom. The show started quietly and gained its audience on its own, not because of a business plan, but because they were largely left to make a funny, smart show.

This new DVD contains the recent PHINEAS AND FERB CHRISTMAS VACATION episode plus four more: Interview with a Platypus; Oh There You Are, Perry; Chez Platypus and Perry Lays an Egg. All are great examples of how this series weaves its storylines with grace and panache, loaded with lots of quick asides in the spirit of other great comedy cartoons like Bugs Bunny and Bullwinkle.

There's an extra episode in the Bonus Features called ""Doof Side of the Moon"" preceeded by a 12-minute feature about how the creative team writes and performs their original songs and how one of their favorite episodes ""Spongebob""veteran Dan Povenmire,  comedy writer/performer Martin Olson, Jon Colton Barry (son of legendary songwriter Jeff Barry) and Jeff ""Swampy Marsh"" whose is the grandson of bandleader Les Brown.

I mention the musical connections especially because Phineas and Ferb is very music-generated and again, not just by committee-engineered pop tunes by by comic effect, from rock to big band, Broadway to Bollywood. Many of the songs written for the show have been released on CD, including a new holiday favorites album. Most of the music and songs came from the above team, with the able help of musical director Danny Jacob.

The interactive menu is really interactive, not just called by that heavily-used term. Clicking various objects results in quick appearances by characters. One in particular takes you to a video in which the show staff conspire to cover a co-workers office with post-it notes.

You can tell from the bonus features on the new PHINEAS AND FERB: A VERY PERRY CHRISTMAS DVD that the creative forces behind the show are relatively free of the interfering words: ""Well, I don't get that joke and neither do my associates, so the whole world won't so therefore kill it dead and let me watch is fester, rot and bleach in the sun."" Well, maybe not in those words, but I can just imagine how a song like ""Squirrels in my Pants"" might die in a corporate approval process.

Let's hope the recent phenomenal success of Phineas and Ferb continues to thrive in relative autonomy. But somehow even if it does happen to a degree, we can probably look forward to a sly spoof of the internal ordeal, so veiled it may pass over the tops of the Herman Miller head rests.",1287360000,,2561,4.791383219954649
4156894,5,B003ND0AXS,"I first watched 'Phineas and Ferb' because my son liked it and I wanted to make sure I knew what kind of shows he was watching. Now I'M hooked, and I am known to watch it by myself too!

Because it is such a great show, I would have bought this DVD solely for the Christmas Special alone. However, this DVD is packed with lots of great extras.

The DVD cover mentions that it includes a bonus, not yet aired on TV episode, the Doof Side of the Moon. But in addition to that, there are also 4 other episodes:
- Interview with a Platypus
- Oh There You Are Perry
- Chez Platypus
- Perry Lays an Egg

So that right there makes this a good buy. Add to that some interesting behind the scenes bits, the jukebox-i-nator with the Christmas music from this episode, and few ultimately unimportant but cute easter eggs in the menu. And the virtual fireplace is actually pretty darn cute! So all in all, it's a great show, a fun Christmas special, and you get a lot for your money.",1286841600,3,971,4.209677419354839
