8153248,4,B000JU8HL0,This is a very good post natal workout. Good cardio sections as well as strength training and core workout. I would recommend.,1362009600,,126,4.7727272727272725
8153249,3,B000JU8HL0,I thought this would be a work out video that I could do with my 9 month old based on the cover of the DVD case.  Can't just a dvd by its cover :),1361664000,,146,3.2941176470588234
8153250,5,B000JU8HL0,This is a great DVD for moms. It's a nice simple workout when you just don't have the time. It's a great simple work out even if you just don't have child around. It makes it easy to workout especially when you don't have the drive but know you have to do something. It touches on all areas of your body without having to kill yourself and you still see the results. It makes you start to feel good about yourself. Thank you.,1359590400,,425,4.132530120481928
8153251,5,B000JU8HL0,"I would like to say that this dvd is more work then it seems. After a 20 minute session
I was sweating like I just ran two miles. I really like this DVD hopefully after 2 months
I will have shed 20 lbs of post baby weight!",1343347200,,222,3.74468085106383
8153252,5,B000JU8HL0,"I love this workout video.  There are four ten minute sections, and I usually only do one of the sections a day.  I don't have a lot of time in my day, but I can do 10 minutes.  I often can feel the effects of it the next day, too.  It is fun, and they often work the muscles in a good order to work opposing muscles one after the other, letting the one relax after it is worked (ex. biceps then the triceps) so that it doesn't kill you throughout the workout, but still gets those muscles toned.  There are few videos that I can do day after day.  Many are too intense that on my lazy days I don't want to even think about them.  This video is not that way, but still gets your heart going and your muscles burning.  I highly recommend it.",1316390400,,740,3.9863945578231292
8153253,2,B000JU8HL0,I bought three post natal videos and this one is by far the weakest. The workouts aren't very challenging and the pace is strange. I'd look elsewhere.,1298332800,,150,4.592592592592593
8153254,5,B000JU8HL0,"I bought this video after the birth of my second child, and I still use it 14 months later.  It's great to use on days when I can't get out to run or if I'm tired of the treadmill.  There are four 10 minute segments that make up a pretty good workout when used together.  I can feel it in my legs the next day if I haven't done it in a while.  Lots of squats!",1216252800,,359,3.6842105263157894
8153255,5,B000JU8HL0,"I bought the Buff Moms book after having my 2nd daughter three months ago.  But the book was difficult to follow if I wanted to have any sort of a flow to my workout, so I ordered the DVD and I'm glad that I did.  The workouts are broken down into 4 10-minute segments, easy to do and quick!  I'm trying to do at least one of the 10-minute workouts a day and really do believe that in that short amount of time I can make a difference in my post-baby body. The author has really done her homework and knows what she's talking about, but I only know this because I also read her book. The instructor is easy to follow and pleasant and there's even a modified workout that you can follow.",1183334400,,686,4.104477611940299
