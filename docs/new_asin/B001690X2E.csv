8261727,5,B001690X2E,Excellent!  Well done and very informative. So much information; we knew so little about the cranes.,1417219200,,100,5.25
8261728,4,B001690X2E,"My husband attends an adult day center several days a week. I bought this film for him to bring in the day he also shared a personal scrapbook of a visit to the International Crane Foundation in Wisconsin. It was very much appreciated by this audience. A little repetition was perhaps even positive. This would be a good film to show at senior centers, too. Not that younger people won't enjoy it -- just that this is an audience it is sometimes hard to find interesting material for.",1296432000,,484,4.511363636363637
8261729,4,B001690X2E,"The film overall is good. The footage of the cranes throughout the film is excellent. Crane lovers will enjoy it very much for the beautiful footage.

One flaw in the film, though, is the repetitive scenes. The other flaw is the lack of detail for the overall natural history of the cranes presented ==> such as where the cranes migrate to in the winter; final destination(s)of summer migration; length of time to migrate; life span; mating rituals...",1241913600,4,451,4.857142857142857
8261730,5,B001690X2E,A truly beautiful and fantastic photo essay on the magnificent sand hill cranes. I would strongly recommend this as viewing for anyone with even the slightest interest in wildlife and the outdoors. The sights and sounds so superbly photographed will keep you glued to the screen.,1238716800,2,279,5.086956521739131
8261731,3,B001690X2E,"This is a PBS program; a 30 minute job stretched into an hour.  The story of the cranes is interesting, and much of the photography if beautiful.  It's a shame that there is so much repetition.",1214611200,4,193,4.333333333333333
