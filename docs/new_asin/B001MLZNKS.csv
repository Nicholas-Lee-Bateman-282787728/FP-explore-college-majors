3698106,1,B001MLZNKS,"First and foremost, be aware that even though he is featured prominently on the DVD cover, this is not a Steven Seagal movie: Seagal is onscreen for only 5 minutes and 35 seconds throughout the entire 94-minute film. Thus, this movie cannot be reviewed as I would a regular Seagal picture, but rather as the lame DTV attempt to rip off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later</a>&nbsp;that it is. Plainly said, this rather embarrassing debacle is by no means a must-have for either horror or action fans and not even Seagal devotees will be thrilled by it. If you don't like bad movies, just take it for granted from here, but if you're still not convinced, read on.

The plot: sometime in the near future, a mysterious outbreak causes the majority of the human population to turn into bloodthirsty zombies (they're referred to as vampires, but they're zombies) and scatters survivors into isolated groups. One of these groups - including an unassuming blonde girl (Jenna Harrison,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Brother-Tom/dp/B00006BSDH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Brother Tom</a>), a religious young man (Danny Midwinter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackbeard/dp/B000FGFBM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackbeard</a>), and an orphaned child (Skye Bennett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Floors/dp/B001D262JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Floors</a>) - finds itself trapped inside an infested hospital, and their only way of escaping lies in the aid of the mysterious Commander Tao (Seagal), a leather-garbed swordsmaster leading a team of highly-trained killers against the rising tide of darkness.

This is a horror film, so you won't see too much action even though Steven carries around a sword and shotgun. There are a few fight scenes, but Seagal's moves consist entirely of slicing up baddies and shooting them in a most unexciting fashion. 'Seagal Squad' member Tanoai Reed (Dwayne Johnson's personal stunt double) gets the best fights, but that's not saying much at all. Zombies, you see, can be incapacitated by simply shoving them against a wall, so all of the swordplay and shooting is kind of unnecessary as far as I'm concerned. The horror element, for the most part, is limited to the kinda-spooky hospital setting, a few scenes wherein the infected chow down on entrails, and a couple of jolt scares that wouldn't make a moth take flight. Isolation and separation themes are played up but come off as kinda stupid when characters get so separated from the group that they're completely out of earshot in only a matter of seconds, despite that they're all on the same floor of an enclosed building. It's just not scary.

The acting is on the poor side. Skye Bennett and no-name stoner Stephen Hagan give the best performances of the bunch, but this isn't high praise when considering the amateurish Jenna Harrison, the unlikeable Emma Catherwood, the pesky Daniel Percival (""Sinchronisity""), the inexperienced Tanoai Reed, and the perpetually-stunted Mr. Seagal. Danny Midwinter isn't awful, but he's nothing really special, either. Bigger-name stars Linden Ashby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) and Keith David (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marked-for-Death/dp/6305168873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marked for Death</a>) have significant parts that they do well with, but since neither of them get in on any of the action or even interact with Seagal, their presence ends up being a disappointment. The zombies are a bit of a character in themselves: while not vampires, neither are they the brainless sprinters that are all the rage now. One of the more interesting scenes in the movie occurs when an infected, held at bay by a door, attempts to talk Jenna Harrison into offering herself because there is no hope left for humans; another is when an infected approaches a sleeping Skye Bennett, strokes her hair, and apparently attempts to bite her without waking her. These displays of intelligence and sentiment aren't explained, but they do make the film a little bit more interesting.

As a whole, however, the movie is beyond saving, and I'm already regretting buying it. Even those Seagal fans who buy each of his flicks just to have an opinion of it should not feel compelled to judge our hero's five minutes of stiff chopping and monotone delivery in this one - it's just not worth it.",1238025600,4,4718,5.974852071005917
3698107,1,B001MLZNKS,"QUESTION:  What is more unstoppable that Steven Seagal?  ANSWER:  Steven Seagal with a sword..

The main reason I have not watched any Steven Seagal movies in many years is because his character is always untouchable. How many times can we watch Seagal slice through the biggest and baddest villians like a hot knife through butter and never even get a single scratch? It's a boring formula, and drains all suspense from the movie.. because you know our hero will never even get touched by anyone of anything.

I bought Against The Dark hoping it would be a little bit different. After all, it was a total change up for Steven Seagal as far as movie type. He wouldn't be that dumb as to bring the same old untouchableness into a horror movie would he???? But he did... and right before I put the movie in I said laughingly, ""I'll bet Seagal has the same look he always has in every movie.. He will be invincible and never even break a sweat. He will always be in total control and never have a finger laid on him."" And I was so right...

Even in a world where an unknown virus has turned most of the population into vampire like creatures, Stevie wears his same old hide kicking grimace and obliterates everything in his path with ease. He never gets scared, never flinches and has the whole situation by the short hairs.

The acting is bad in this movie as well.. When Stevie delivers his lines he sounds like he is trying to be a gangsta.. other times he sounds like Fog Horn Leg Horn doing a Steven Seagal impression. And yet sometimes, he reminds me of my Uncle Louie when he was a bit younger and had teeth. Stevies moves were bad, was he injured or something????? All he did was the same few swish, swish, swishes with his sword and slash the vampires necks.. either that, or he shot them. And he swung a couple around by the arm and threw them through a wall or window. AND might I ad here, that these vampires could be killed just like any normal human being.

The story was badly written, because we see a group of survivors enter an abandoned hospital through a broken window.. Then later, Stevie and his crew enter through a broken door.. Then everyone has to trek through the largest hospital in the world to find a security door before the generator goes out and seals all the doors and windows. I guess it was to difficult to turn around and exit the building through that broken window or door that people climbed in through in the first place?????

So before you think of purchasing this movie.. do this simple visualization first;  Close your eyes, envision Stevie Seagal walking through dark streets and a dark abandoned hospital.. See Stevie flawlessly kicking the snot out of everyone and wearing his trade mark grimace at all times.. Now see Stevie save the day and walk into the sunrise victorious over everything.

Did you do that short little visualization??? Good!!!! You just watched Against The Dark.. and now you can save your hard earned money. Because this movie blows serious chunks.",1237852800,4,3014,4.55268022181146
3698108,2,B001MLZNKS,Anyone else notice that the scene showing the front of the hospital looks exactly like the scene from Stephen Kings Kingdom Hospital? Pretty sure it is the same one. Seagal in a vampire movie kind of struck me as odd but since the wife is a vampire movie buff we went ahead and picked it up. Glad I only spent the buck at Redbox!,1235779200,,329,4.15625
3698109,3,B001MLZNKS,"From his first movie, Above the Law (aka Nico), Steven Seagal has always been the star of his movies (with the exception of Executive Decision where he had a cameo). ""Against the Dark"" breaks the trend. It's not really a ""Steven Seagal movie"" but rather an average B-grade post-apocalyptic  zombie movie featuring Steven Seagal, in a heroic role of course, but with limited screen time.

Those hoping for an action movie with Seagal as the star may be disappointed, but taken for what it is, a postapocalyptic horror movie, I think it works pretty well, and Seagal is a bonus. It's nice to see him try new things. There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",1234828800,2,663,4.563025210084033
3698110,1,B001MLZNKS,"Some may not even be as generous to call Stephen Seagal an action legend.  Let me start by saying this, I am very forgiving when it comes to b-rate action/sci-fi movies.  I enjoy that genre, even in all of its corny and unbelieveable antics.  It is one thing to be a b-movie, and shunned by the masses, they are definetly not for everybody.  It is quite another to be so bad that not even fans of this type of movie can't stand it.  For all intents and purposes, for people like me, this film should have been an easy slam dunk.  A matial arts star (albiet washed up) and vampires.  No one watching a movie like this is expecting an oscar-worthy script, or even good acting.  Rather, they are looking for some redeeming quality, even if an over-the-top action sequence, or creative carnage, or in some way making light of itself (i.e. Bruce Campbell movies).

If there is one B-movie killer, it is the 'b' word.  Boring.  There are a myriad of bad movies out there, each bad for its own reason, but at least they are not boring, and thus have a select audience.  Against the Dark couldn't be more boring.  They do not even attempt to get you connected to any one of the characters.  The biggest miss here is also the most obvious-Stephen.  An Aikido master, we should have seen some action.  His character is supposed to be a sword master, yet despite that, we see NO martial arts, and for a sword master, he barely touches it.  Even with a big, cool sword, he opts to just shoot the vampires with no flash at all.  The vampires, by the way, are less vampires, and more like zombies, except they can be stopped easily.

Even though the story is primarily based in one spot, the hospital, the director decides to insult the viewer by showing the front of the hospital every single time we go back to them, probably no less than 8 times. As if we've forgotten where they are every 5 minutes.

I really think it is difficult to mess up this kind of movie for the people like me who enjoy them, but Against the Dark really went out of it's way to be terrible in every way.

I can't imagine what circumstances led to Mr Seagal doing this film, but he has really hit rock bottom.  The only consulation I can muster is that from here, at least he really can't do any worse...I hope...",1234828800,11,2277,4.345971563981043

3698118,3,B001MLZNKS,"Despite the cover, Steven Seagal is NOT the main character in this film, so those of you hoping he would kick as much vampire ass as Wesley Snipes did in the Blade series will be disappointed. Instead, most of the screen time is spent following a group of young survivors around in a creepy hospital, and in a post-apocalyptic scenario, this would be the worst group of people to be stuck with. Anyone who gets in trouble is immediately left for dead, even if another character has a chance to help him or her, so that takes away most of their likability right there. Basically, they need to find medicine for one of their own, and then make it to a security door before it locks and traps them inside the hospital. I'm not sure why they couldn't just break a window and escape that way, but whatever. The vampires in this are actually zombie-vampires, and most are mindless cannibals, while others can talk just fine and claim to have evolved. Now let's talk about Steven Seagal. Seagal plays vampire-zombie-slayer Tao, and he and another dude named Tagart, along with two women who are mute, make up a team of slayers on a mission to clear the hospital of baddies, and occasionally interact with the other survivors. Seagal's role is very odd, he walks in and out of scenes at a quick pace, slaying the mutants, saving some people, and then leaving with his team as quickly as he came. He's absent for a lot of the film, and shows up every so often just to remind you he's there. Unbeknownst to Tao and the others, two military guys are bickering over when to launch a missile-strike and blow up the entire block they're at to stop the mutants from spreading. Those two military guys are none other than Linden 'Johnny Cage' Ashby, and John Carpenter alumni Keith David, and that's really all they do is bicker. They don't get to fight any mutants or even interact with Seagal. Their performances are the best in the movie, but it would've been nice to give them more to do. Though this movie has a lot of faults, it still makes for an entertaining horror-thriller, and a couple of the action scenes really stand out. There are a few subplots that are so short-lived, you wonder why the filmmakers even bothered. Tao's team is more interesting than the other survivors, but you barely learn anything about them. Overall, it's a mixed-bag for sure, and will probably let down most Seagal fans, but those into survival-horror will enjoy it.

Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the ending, so unless you've seen Against the Dark or you don't care about spoilers, read no further.

So when the survivors finally escape the hospital, how did they know to get away from the block so quickly before it was destroyed if they had no contact with the military? Did Tao know they would launch a missile, and if he did, why did his team waste so much time in the hospital?",1432512000,,2868,4.5347490347490345

3698128,3,B001MLZNKS,"I was already to take umbrage to the claim that this was Steven Seagal's first horrible movie, until I reread the description and realized they meant his first `horror' movie.  This general theme of confusion continued when I couldn't figure out whether the `infected' depicted in this movie were vampires or zombies; they didn't seem to fit either category.  In any regard, this is an odd movie fraught with unexplainable complexities and yet a single minded bulldozer approach to the action sequences.  The story takes place in an epidemic ravaged world, reduced to the plight of a few people trapped in a hospital that appears to have a lot of unfettered ingress but no egress.  Backtracking to find their way out would have been the logical thing to do, so they don't.  Instead, these idiots choose to join forces with another couple and wander aimlessly through endless halls filled with hordes of hungry infected thingies.  Picture it, they're in the dark; afraid the power will fail and lock them in forever, lights are flickering, things jump out and bite, they're never free of halls going nowhere.  Apparently, they forgot about windows and the front door..........  The result is repetitious twaddle.  This was like watching rats run a maze.  And yes, Steven Seagal (as Tao) shows up with his `hunters' to occasionally help these idiots lost in this building.  They cross paths more than once and more than once Seagal has to rescue them.  Think about it, they continue to find each other but they can't find the entrance/exit!!!

3698135,1,B001MLZNKS,"The only reason I can that this stinker of a movie was ever made was to capitalize on the zombie/vampire monster craze. The movie stinks of being a quick production just to cash in. The plot, production, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, pretty much every aspect of this film shows obvious signs of being a rush job. I have seen bad videos before, but none that have such a lack of commitment to story and concept I saw from Against the Dark.

Where to begin? The first and foremost is the story. Even most bad movies have a coherent plot. Against the Dark's plot is essentially this: Run into abandoned hospital, get attacked by vampires in various scenes, get out of hospital. That's it. The only motivation in this movie is to try and not die. The only conflicts in this movie are the surprise attacks by vampires and a completely useless plot device about the military wanting to blow up the building by the designated time. There is an attempt at a plot twist regarding the vampires, but it is so woefully utilized you may as well ignore it. Add to that some ridiculous plot holes and various inconsistencies and you have one dull mess of a story.

So what's the story? It's a mix between I am Legend and Blade (or The Last of Us for you video gamers out there). Most of Earth's population have been infected with something that turns them into flesh eating vampires. Yes I said flesh eating vampires... they don't drink much blood, but they love eating humans. Don't ask me why they are called vampires. Maybe because they supposedly only come out at night. Anyway there are just a few people left and some of them go into a hospital to get medical supplies. Turns out the hospital is overrun with vampires and the only way out is some door that can only open if the power is still on. Forget the fact they found a inside the hospital with no problems. Anyway as a side story a group called The Hunters (isn't that creative?) also go into the hospital to look for survivors.

Having a door that will stop working any minute isn't enough ""suspense"" so the movie decided to waste more time by tagging on the military eager to wipe out the area with bombs and the clock is ticking on when they do this. So you have the normal humans going into various rooms and getting attacked by vampires much like a video game. Occasionally somebody will try and say something poignant or philosophical, but the delivery is so dead pan and essentially meaningless to the film it doesn't matter.

Now the hunters are basically two men and two women (double date night?) wearing black leather and are too cool act scared, angry... or anything for that matter. They are led by Steven Seagal, who is really phoning in this performance. It's almost funny how little he is utilized in this film, and I'm not just talking about him having a supporting role instead of the lead. When the action starts flying all you see from Seagal is a swipe of his sword here or a kick there. He's more walking than fighting. The camera keeps doing critical cuts in his choreography. So much you would think Steven Seagal doesn't really know how to fight. Does he charge extra for good fight scenes? The only good fight choreography comes from hunter Taggart played by Tanoai Reed. Now those fight scenes can get pretty cool. Other than that the fighting is stupid. Vampires grab people for a long time, never thinking to bite them (unless the script calls for it). They run blindly up to swords and guns and sometimes seem to disappear from the fight. Not much to keep you interested action-wise.

Acting is sub-par, and I believe it's because the movie was rushed. You see attempts at putting some inflection and emotion into the parts, but it feels like there wasn't enough time to work on them. The soundtrack is very generic. Special effects seem to all be spent on either the explosions at the end of the movie or the buckets of entrails they bought from the butcher shop (movie was shot on a $9mil budget). This movies loves to ""shock"" you with bloody entrails and organs. By halfway through the movie I was saying, ""oh look.. another intestine... I wonder if it's the same intestine as the last 13 ones they shown"". So while there is blood and gore it's not interesting in any way. Make up on the vampires are mostly focused on the teeth... kinda. I won't spoil it for some of you who will watch the movie anyway. You may even find them interesting.

So the movie pretty much sucks. The DVD transfer is actually not too bad. The details are clear and the dark scenes aren't too washed out. The audio was actually impressive in regards to the surround sound. I swear more than once the stuff happening in the movie I thought was going on in my house. You get Dolby 5.1 surround in English and Dolby 2.0 Stereo in French (plus subtitles). The extras are pretty lean. There is a behind the scenes documentary called Fighting the Shadows. It's nine minutes long and runs like a promotional piece with less details and more hype. Aside from that there are tons of trailers for other horror movies from Sony. And that's all she wrote.

Against the Dark is a pointless film with a pointless plot. Even Steven Seagal fans may want to pass on this as he is not doing much at all. Horror fans must have better things to watch. Action fans may get a few minutes of thrills (not from Seagal), but is that worth the full length of a film? This film is best seen by fledgling film makers to see how NOT to create a film like this.",1398816000,,5494,4.493493493493493

I sat through the whole movie waiting for it to get better, waiting for it to entertain me in some way.  I finally got to the end of the movie and all I could think was, ""what the HELL was that?!?!""  Really the best looking part of the movie is the cover art.  It's like they tried to make their own version of resident evil in a way, calling the so-called vampires ""the infected""... and yet they are nothing like vampires, not one bit.  You start into the movie thinking it's going to be a vampire movie, possibly a knock-off of the Blade movies... yet it's more like a REALLY BAD knock-off of Resident Evil. And in the opening scene, after the intro, you see ""the infected"" chasing a kid and you think, ""how are those vampires?""  You don't even get close to a 1/4 of the way through the movie before you're really confused about what the hell is going on.  You also have realized by that point that the so-called ""vampires"" are actually more like zombies...  The acting is REALLY BAD throughout the whole movie!  Yet some of the actors you can tell have potential to be good actors.  You can also tell that some of the actors just aren't really all that into the script either.  You actually don't see Steven Seagal that much, even though you go into the movie thinking it's going to be based around his character.  Instead the movie spends practically all of it's time with a group stuck in what I guess is supposed to be a hospital.  The movie is really confusing at some parts and you never even get any answers to the confusing parts.  It was like they said, ""We'll just throw in this scene that doesn't make any sense WHATSOEVER, so we can make this movie LONGER!""

The whole movie is completely predictable ""around every corner.""  The ""action"" scenes are not all that thrilling and the characters time and time again do things that make absolutely no sense.  There isn't any suspense to any of the movie at all, mainly because everything is oh-so predictable.  You automatically know the characters are going to do something stupid.

One of the scenes makes absolutely no sense at all... I guess it was an extremely poor attempt to try and make ""the infected"" seem more like vampires.  This isn't even a spoiler alert, since this scene doesn't even fit into the movie at all... nor does it really give anything about the movie away.  You see a woman, whom I'm guessing is supposed to be infected (you never get an answer to that question), filing down all of her teeth (not just the canines) to make them sharp.  After she's done that, the camera view moves to where you can see this guy hanging upside down.  You think she's going to bite his neck and drink his blood, instead she slices his throat with a knife, lets the blood drip into a cup and then drinks it. HUH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  Oh and lets not forget to mention that you NEVER see this woman again in the movie.  This is really the only ""memorable"" scene in the whole movie and it's only because of how confusing it is... and the fact that it doesn't even really fit into the movie.

You are left very confused throughout the whole movie.  Steven Seagal's group, ""the hunters"", get very little camera time... which is odd.  They also start outside of the hospital.  The whole movie is based on the premise of this group of people trying to get out of the hospital and avoid the infected.  This really makes no sense because the initial group of civilians that you see in the movie, you see them entering the hospital through a broken window. They meet up with a couple who I'm guessing has been hiding in the hospital for awhile.  They made it seem like they were all on the top floor of the hospital... so how did the first group get to the top floor and enter through a broken window?(never answered, nor does it make any sense)  The ""hunters"" also enter the hospital from the outside (I'm guessing by the same broken window...) and yet you don't know how they got in...  and it's never answered.  Since the whole movie is about them trying to ""survive"" the infected and get out of the hospital, why they didn't just go out of the window that the main group came through in the first place we will never know... ever.  Initially the only reason they go further into the hospital is to find medication for the little girl in there group who is supposedly sick.  The weird part too is that whenever anyone goes anywhere in the hospital they never seem to backtrack at all.  You would think that it would make sense for this group to get the meds and then just leave the hospital through the window that they came through in the first place.  They also make the hospital feel like this maze that the characters have to find their way through in order to get out...  I don't even remember if they found any of the meds for the girl who is supposed to be sick.  The girl only looks, acts or appears to be sick in the beginning of the movie.  Throughout the rest of the movie she seems fine.

The little girl during the movie gets separated from everyone, and after running I guess she was just so gosh darn tired that she finds a blanket and figures it's a good place to take a nap... really?  Nobody would ever in that situation think, ""Boy, I just got done running from some infected people... gosh I'm tired from running! Oh hey! Lookee here, it's a blanket!  This seems like a good spot to lay down and fall asleep! It's not like there might be any infected around or anything.""  Oh and the worst part, and most predictable (most of you already know what's going to happen), once the little girl falls asleep, an infected guy comes out from the shadows... dun dun dun! Seriously?

  I could just keep going on and on about how much this movie SUCKED!!!  I actually got a headache from watching this movie, that's how bad it really is.  Why would Steven Seagal make a movie like this, I have no idea... but apparently he is desperate and will do any role (no matter how horrible it is) just so he can keep being in movie's... come on dude! If I could give this a negative star rating, I would give it a NEGATIVE 3 stars... that's how much this movie sucked.  You finish the movie with more questions than answers... if you can even finish it.  I only watched the whole thing because it was something to kill time with AND I was hoping the movie would get better... and yet it never did.  I feel like the idea for the movie, before they began writing and producing the movie, was probably a good idea... yet they failed so miserably!",1384041600,2,6602,4.399835119538334

3698143,1,B001MLZNKS,"I watched this movie for two reasons:  First, as a Steven Seagal movie; and second as a vampire movie.  I was disappointed on both fronts.  First off, Steven Seagal is hardly in the movie.  The vast majority of his airtime consists of repetitive shots of him and his group of vampire hunters striding down the street/hall in their cool leather coats.  I would characterize his appearance as more of a walk-on than an actual role.

Second, it's not a vampire movie.  Although the ""infected"" apparently can't be out in daylight, they're clearly zombies rather than vampires.

There's no cohesion to this movie, no particular plot, and no logic whatsoever.  The majority of the film deals with a group of people in a hospital trying to make their way from apparently an upper floor to a vehicle in the basement.  Part of the group came in a window (on an upper floor?  How?  Never explained), while another couple, the owner of the vehicle, were already there (why did they get so far from their truck?  Never explained).  Eventually, as the civilian group are trying to make their way through the hospital, the vampire hunters are cutting a swath through the undead in the building.  After making a point of saying it's only four hours until sunrise, the civilians nevertheless wander through the hospital instead of sensibly holing up somewhere secure and getting out after daybreak.  Again, no explanation.  The machinations to get the group separated so they can be attacked individually is pathetically transparent.

The real theme of this movie is repetition.  The civilians walk through halls, talk, walk some more, barricade some doors, talk some more, lather, rinse, repeat.  The vampire hunters walk down streets or halls, walk some more, occasionally slash an ""infected,"" lather, rinse, repeat.  All of the above is interspersed with repetitive flashes of the infected fondling bloody presumably human guts, I guess on the premise that the viewer will accept a heapin' helpin' of gore in lieu of any genuine scare.  And yes, it's obvious to even casual viewing that multiple shots of feasting zombies and striding Seagal are reused several times.  It's actually fairly insulting to the viewer.  Also, when one of the ""infected"" is encountered, you flash to the bloody-zombie-feast shots, presumably to let the viewer know for sure that, yes, this is one of the ""infected.""  This badly overdone telegraphing adds an almost comical note which actually comes as almost a relief -- a pathetic hint of amusement amidst the boredom.

Some genuine dark humor and some actual Steven Seagal action and maybe even, oh, some actual dialogue from our action hero might have saved this abysmal sludge of a film.",1367107200,,2706,4.984375

3698153,2,B001MLZNKS,"Steven Seagal has been in some bad movies, but few have been as laughably horrible as Against The Dark (2009), a direct to video fiasco that features Segal as a sword swinging zombie slayer.  The primary reasons why this movie is a disaster is an incredibly inept screenplay, idiotic dialog, and a budget that confines most of the action to the interior of a hospital.  The action scenes are the high points of the movie, but most of the heavy duty fighting is performed by Tanoai Reed, the cousin of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.

In what's become a very common scenario, some kind of virus has infected humanity, turning the masses into zombielike creatures who crave flesh.  In an unspecified city, survivors Amelia (Emma Catherwood), Dylan (Daniel Percival), Ricky (Stephan Hagan), and a young girl named Charlotte (Skye Bennett) enter a hospital, and team up with Dorothy (Jenna Harrison) and her boyfriend Morgan (Danny Midwinter).  With the generator ""dying"", the group formulates a plan to navigate through the hospital, reach the garage, and then drive to safety.  Unfortunately, the infected scatted throughout the hospital stand in their way.

It's a dull and dreary trek, as the group wanders through rooms and corridors, getting upset by graffiti written in blood, and stacked up furniture blocking their way.  For a change of scenery, they hang out in stairwells and the toilet.  How this sorry collection has survived is a mystery, as they carry no weapons, and have zero fighting skills.  Their most effective tactic for dealing with the infected is to push them away, or barricade and jam doors, which is done a ridiculous number of times.

Tao (Seagal), Tagart (Reed), and two women dressed in leather outfits are ""hunters"".  Armed with knives and guns, they tread fashionably through the city, killing the infected.  Approaching their task with lots of attitude, Tao's group enters the hospital, and begins hunting down the infected.

The writing really doesn't do the cast any favors, as they wander about like mice in a maze, the survivors come off as idiots who can't fight, don't know where they are going, and abandon each other at the first sign of trouble.  It's frustrating, watching these inept fools getting separated again and again.  The hunters are ridiculous in their own way, strutting around with grim looks on their faces, while by some miracle avoiding cutting each other with their weapons, while battling the zombies.  The musical score does a nice job of creating atmosphere, unfortunately the action rarely lives up to it.

With decent screen presence, good physical skills, and most of the spotlight fight scenes, Tanoai Reed is probably the most entertaining element, but that really isn't saying a whole lot.  Skye Bennett (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Floors/dp/B002V8U9PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Floors</a>), who made her film debut in Seagal's Shadow Man (2006), appears in her second film with Seagal, while Keith David has a minor role, as a cartoonish army general.

In a bonus featurette (a rarity for a Seagal film) some speak about the significance of Seagal's first foray into the horror genre.  It's actually not a bad idea, but this poorly written effort devotes way too much time to the inept survivor group, cutting into Seagal's screentime.  A leather overcoat helps smooth out Seagal's bulky frame, as he waves his saber around, but he generally seems disinterested and just going through the motions.

Some guy from the State Dept. is supporting and communicating with Segal and his team and wants to make sure they are not in the area before it gets sterilized, which is what the military wants to do.

3698157,1,B001MLZNKS,"For some reason, Against the Dark is ashamed of its zombies.  We can only assume this was a miscalculation on the part of the producer who must have believed vampires would sell better.  Make no mistake, Against the Dark is about a zombie apocalypse. That's a shame, because if the movie was termed zombie survival horror it might have had a chance.

In the apocalyptic landscape vampires - I mean zombies - outnumber humans. The few survivors whisper of Tau-ffy (Steven Seagal) the Zombie Slayer and his legendary band of hunters. He and his black leather hotties are renowned for their zombie-killing skill.  Which is too bad, because they aren't on screen for more than ten minutes.

Instead, we watch two different groups: the military, who is still fully functional despite the apocalypse, and a bunch of idiots in a creepy hospital. One of these groups talks endlessly about sanitizing the area with a nuclear bomb to contain the infection.  The other group wanders around aimlessly, getting high and moaning about their plight.  Can you guess which is which?

There are three plots, but two are extraneous because they've been copied and pasted from other films.  The all-powerful military, which has no place in a collapsed society, is a staple of zombie survival movies set in the modern day.  The katana-wielding zombie slayer is a different genre entirely.  And the fact that the zombies are evolving doesn't amount to much other than to make you feel a little bad for all the zombies Tau keeps slaying.

Somewhere in this mess there's an actual movie, but it doesn't involve Seagal's team of pouty zombie-bashers or tortured military commanders waffling about blowing things up. Against the Dark wants to be better than it is.  Part of the reason it insists the undead are vampires is because the various survivors repeatedly insist that ""humans are the monsters.""  This is the plot of the book that spawned the genre, I Am Legend, where the vampire-slaying hero turns out to be the villain. You might have seen this plot in such films as The Last Man on Earth (1964), The Omega Man (1971) or I Am Legend (2007).

3698158,1,B001MLZNKS,"Against the Dark (Richard Crudo, 2009)

Everything I should need to tell you about this monstrosity, a film so bad I had to knock Kung Pow: Enter the Fist off my list of the hundred worst movies ever made in order to admit it to that august list, can be summed up in five simple words:

Steven Seagal vs. the Zombies.

Yes, you heard me correctly. This is a movie in which an almost-incoherent Steven Seagal, playing a character named Tao (screenwriter Matthew Klickstein, whose highest-profile previous credit was as a location scout/on-set dresser for Mysterious Skin, had to reach really deep into the symbolism bag for THAT one, baby!), has to martial-art his way through a horde of the undead with a straggling band of survivors before the evil, evil government forces firebomb that entire sector of the city where these people are. There was no thought given tot he fact that, you know, said survivors are actually survivors, and have been living in the midst of an area so infested with zombies that said evil, evil government had written off the idea that anyone could still be living there, so these folks are not without survival skills. And yet, the second Steven Seagal and his craggy, handsome face (oh, wait, he's older now, and looking kinda slack and bloated) show up, all the survivors, of both sexes, turn into bowls of quivering jelly who are entirely incapable of figuring out even how to get out of a zombie's way.

This movie is an insult to the intelligence of everyone who watches it, much less those who acted in it. Please avoid ever putting yourself through the pain of experiencing it. ",1293062400,,1614,4.709219858156028
3698159,1,B001MLZNKS,I'll keep this sweet and short. I've been a fan of of of Seagal for some time but this is by far the worst movie he has ever made. He can only go up from here if not he should think of retiring.,1288915200,,194,3.5348837209302326
3698160,1,B001MLZNKS,"I ran across this one while creating a new catalog of my movie library, which is heavy with horror and comic horror.  I wasn't able to recall much about it at the time, so I plugged it in.  I couldn't finish it.  For me, it is simply not watchable - for two main reasons.  First, the small band of ""civilian"" survivors did not carry weapons of any kind!  They just blundered around a huge hospital complex looking for food and medicine, fighting bare-handed when they were (frequently) attacked.  I can usually suspend disbelief when some aspect of a marginal but watchable movie defies logic, but this one exceeds my capacity.  For a while I tried to keep watching, accepting that the characters were just too stupid to live and that I might at least derive some satisfaction from seeing them get killed off.  Alas, the second flaw proved too great for me.

Second, there are frequent long breaks between the action scenes that are filled with inane (attempts at) dialogue.  I guess that someone thought they could write interesting personal history and commentary fiction.

I had to write a review of this stinkfest.  It's the only way I could salvage a little something from the time I wasted trying to watch it - by warning others away from repeating my mistake.

Steven Seagal is Tao, a sword-wielding zombie hunter dressed in black leather coat. Actually, he doesn't use the weapon very much, let alone his (once trademark) martial arts skills. What he does in this post-Apocalyptic world where most humans turned into zombies, is just roaming in a dilapidated hospital at midnight, mumbling something forgettable occasionally.

There are other characters trapped in this deserted building, some trying to find medicine, some just to survive. In this awfully ineffective story, all they have to do is look worried, keep talking and walking. Actions? None. Scares? None. Unintentional laughter? None, again.

3698166,2,B001MLZNKS,"I certainly can understand all the negative reviews. I had hopes despite them that this might be sort of a ""28-weeks later"" type of film with Seagal, but obviously not a lot of effort was put into this film by the director to make that so. It's just your run-of-the-mill low budget zombie movie, but with Seagal wielding a katana. I'm being a bit generous with the 2-stars because I'm a Seagal fan, though his movies are rather hit and miss in my opinion, and there were a few cool scenes of Seagal and his side-kick loping off heads or kickin' some ace. However, the story is pretty mindless - survivors from a mutation virus that turns people into zombie vampires try to get from point A to point B with Seagal's help. Of course en route to point B are a whole hell of a lot of zombie vampires and the team of 10 dwindle down one by one - 5 of them make it out alive, I'll let you guess which 5 survive. That's part of the fun with these kind of films, right?! Even with an incredibly simple storyline, there are still holes in it!! Again, part of the fun of these types of B-movies is finding the plot holes, so I won't dwell on it.

The first half of the movie you don't really even see much of Seagal. The first half of the movie focuses more on the group of 6 survivors, I guess in an attempt to form some character development, but that miserably fails. But in the 2nd half of the film, Seagal and his band of merry men, make that two chicks and one dude that looks like the Rock, meet up with the group of survivors and assist them in their journey through a hospital to reach ""daylight.""

I can't recommend this movie to anyone really except die-hard zombie movie fans. Seagal fans are likely to be disappointed in this one because his dialogue is pretty limited and you don't really see him use much of his Aikido, though there are some cool scenes using the katana, but even this is fairly lame because of the way it was shot, it makes it difficult to really see what he (or his stunt double) is really doing. Hopefully Seagal's next effort is a little better. I'm a fan, but there is a limit to the amount of $5 I will plop down for a poor quality DVD rental.",1250294400,,2171,4.216346153846154
3698167,1,B001MLZNKS,"Since August is officially Put Down Steven Seagal month, I guess I'll go ahead and do my part. It should be noted that I'm only reviewing AGAINST THE DARK because the priest at my last confession said I have to watch it as penance. I hung out with my shiftless, out of work neighbor Tony who, after 15 minutes of watching this, went out looking for a job.

Creatures who rend flesh and suck blood face off against Steven Seagal, whose films tend to sap your will to live. I figure it's a wash. Nowadays, putting Seagal in a horror film is just being redundant. I was told, perhaps erroneously, that AGAINST THE DARK, a.k.a. LAST NIGHT, actually debuted in Direct-to-Betamax format in participating Bed, Bath & Beyond locales. That's because Tower Records took the easy way out.

This film is established early on as one of those grim post-apocalyptic deals where, in a depressing fizzle of originality, an unstoppable virus had swept across the globe and rendered those infected into blood-ravenous cannibalistic mutant things, part vampire, part zombie. The situation is dire for what's left of humanity. The vampires are everywhere, medication is scarce, food is running out, although, gazing at Seagal's unhaggard physique, dude's probably got a cache of Snickers bars stashed somewhere on that fancy leather duster.

There are two story arcs going down. One arc tracks a group of panicky (yet good looking) people trapped in a hospital, and if these folks were in a Star Trek flick, most of them'd be sporting that red Please-Kill-Me-Now Starfleet uniform. The other plot centers around Steven Seagal's civilian team of vampire hunters (all clad in spiffy black leathers because they're cool like that). These two groups eventually run into each other, and we get a bit of that ""Oh, um, hey..."" bit of dialogue going on. There's a frantic flight to amscray out of there, what with what's left of the military planning an aerial strike at dawn on the sector encompassing the hospital. And, all along, vampires occasionally pop out of the woodwork and try to snack on our cast. Steven Seagal mutters incoherently, his legs (or stunt legs?) spend lots of camera time trudging thru hallways, and he indulges in a bit of unimpressive sword fighty fight and a hint of aikido. Remembering the bounty of cool he used to produce (MARKED FOR DEATH, HARD TO KILL, UNDER SIEGE, heck, even THE GLIMMER MAN), watching Seagal nowadays is some painful shi...

Somewhere, Jean-Claude Van Damme is wiping his brow and saying, ""There, but for the grace of Dieu."" Gone are the days when Steven Seagal was an honest-to-criminy exciting action star making bone crunching action movies. The only thing crunching nowadays is when he's biting into a caramel apple. You got tricked again, if you thought this was a Steven Seagal feature. The once lean but now gravy-filled former action star isn't in this film as much as you'd think. And his acting? Again, in lots of scenes, ol' puffy face is simply walking and walking thru hallways. And, honestly, for a guy walking thru hallways, I don't know that he's that believable a character.

The production values? Please. The film's biggest special effects is to make Steven Seagal look mobile. There was one scene of him in slo-mo, and guy exudes such listlessness I half-thought that maybe it was him in real time all along. The budget is so woeful I actually suspect my jobless neighbor Tony of bankrolling the thing. The creature f/x consists basically of splattering red syrup on the vampires' mouth regions. It can't help but go downhill when you also factor in the crapalicious sreenplay, the dreadful pace, the unappealing action sequences, the sluggish scares, and the unabsorbing characters and the no-name cast which plays them (okay, Keith David is in it - or maybe David Keith?).

Horror 101: When surrounded by the stalking undead, never ever split up. Keep a hand near your weapons. In fact, HAVE SOME FRIGGIN' WEAPONS!! When entering a room occupied by a ghoul and a cowering figure with her back turned towards you, don't assume that the cowering figure is some helpless chick (they rarely are). And, one more time, never split up. I'm just sayin'. Having said that, these are some of the wimpiest, easiest to take out bunch of vampires I've seen on cinema.

This DVD also comes with ""Fighting the Shadows: Behind the Scenes of AGAINST THE DARK (10 minutes long). If you thought Seagal's face was doughy and damp with meat sweats before, brother, just check him out without the magic of make-up. Steven Seagal, master of aikido, never could fend off the Pizza Hut delivery guy.

But there's a rainbow over the horizon for Steven Seagal. Seems like he's slated to co-star in the upcoming theatrical release MACHETE. That may be his last chance to revive a film career and get the eff out of Bucharest, Romania, which just declared a national food shortage. Thanks, Steven.

I am indeed a Steven Seagal fan but not even I can defend this one to much as it is well kinda boring at times, I hate saying that about any film. Seagal has been doing rather well lately with his direct to DVD films or at least compared to others just goes away with this one. It may e because of the writing or the filmmaking but I think it has a lot to do with the actual absence of Steven, he is barley in this film. Still at least the vampire/zombie infected people or what ever look cool.

This film follows two groups of people who are very much the opposites of each other in the fact that one is prepared and the other is not. One group is a group of survivors that are trapped in a hospital over run by these vampire like people. The other is a group of hunters headed by the one and only Steven Seagal. So the movie pushes forth as it shows what it is like in this world from both groups' perspectives and one group is doing better than the other. As the survivors not only try to fend off these creatures they fight each other along the way, you would think they would pull together more. On the flip side the gun toting or in Seagal's case sword wielding hunters are taking these things out.

The thing about this flick is that while a big rip off of other films the vampire/infected people look pretty cool and Seagal is always entertaining it falls very short. The script by Mathew Klickstein could have really used some work because the dialogue is well not all that great, originality could have also been added. The direction from Richard Crudo feels very uneven and makes you wonder if he was trying for something new or just going by the other flicks of this kind. It is weird because this guy has been the DP on some really entertaining flicks. I had really high hopes for this film because when Seagal steps out of his element even a little the results are usually good. His hood flick ""Urban Justice"" was actually very good and very enjoyable, believe it or not.

If you have to have every Seagal flick like myself then I would say go ahead and get this but know now that he is not in this as much as he should have been. Especially since his character is entertaining, but he only shows up every now and then. The infected vampire like people look cool and when Seagal is on screen there are some good kills but other than that, not as good as it could have been.",1247097600,,2405,4.233115468409586
3698169,1,B001MLZNKS,"For quite some time now action star Steven Seagal has been on the downward spiral. Most actors of the genre eventually lose their lure but most have enough sense to bow out before they tarnish their careers. Unfortunately Steven will not. He keeps pumping out mess after mess on a monthly basis which has forced himself to be known as nothing more then a b list actor. Luckily for myself I enjoy really bad movies and still get a good laugh out of any new Seagal works. However Against the dark had no qualities even worth enjoying on a b level.

The premise here is most of the worlds population falls victim to a virus changing people into vampire zombie type creatures. As they ravage any people still remaining there is a special ops group run by Tao (Seagal) who have sworn to eliminate them. On there hilarious journey they find some other survivors in a hospital and join forces in hopes of saving the human race. On top of the zombies they have to worry about the military who has threatened the bomb their location off the map unless they rid the creatures themselves. The film has so many plot holes and such a boring pace you will be lucky to watch it all the way through.

All in all this one falls far short of anything worth watching. Even for Seagals newer releases this one is a joke. It tries to be yet another post apocalyptic zombie type flick, but doesn't have the writing to keep it interesting. Seagal himself was barely in the movie. He would show up every 20 minutes for a couple inaudible lines and some sped up fighting and then disappear. I recommend passing on this one, even if you are the most die hard Seagal fan.",1246665600,,1644,4.422442244224422

We all got ripped off and should be reimbursed according to Biblical law, which I think is 7 fold in this case. What a shameful robbery from his paying fans! SS produced this piece of rot knowing we'd give him another chance at proving he could make better quality films. He willfully stole from us. No wonder he's less and less attractive and able to perform! What goes around, comes around Steven. I think your days are numbered in the film industry.

First-not scary. Second-Bad acting (worse than you would expect, I should say). Third-Seagal is hardly in the movie. The only time we see him is as he and his ""entourage' walk through this bldg easily striking down these creatures as they `step' out one at a time to be sliced and diced!! No thought put into any of these scenes.....it must have taken Stevie a cool 30 minutes on the set to come in and film his whopping < 8 minutes total and then go to another set to start another bad movie. Worst of all how do you have all these creatures running around and the movie is still boring? I was even having a beer and it was still bad........... DO NOT BE DECEIVED!!!

3698174,1,B001MLZNKS,"I admit to renting this film for the sheer pleasure of watching Steven Seagal in a cheesy movie where he says ridiculous things before brandishing justice with a sword.  I wanted to see Seagal kick some butt and have a few laughs at the moronic sense of morality that generally pervades his films.

In this movie, however, you will not find the lowbrow wit of the cook in Under Siege.  In fact, you will find very little of Seagal at all.  The movie follows a circuitous plot--so convoluted that it looks as if the entire movie was filmed up and down the same hallway and in one or two different rooms.  I'm not going to waste my time and yours attempting to criticize the absolute inanity of the story, but rest assured that there is nothing here even remotely entertaining: Saturday morning cartoons have more believable dialogue, student films have similar or better editing, drive-in movies from the 1960s have better props and gore, and most shows on the three big networks have more convincing actors.

For me, though, the worst aspect of this film is the dearth of Seagal.  People who rent and buy his movies like him because he seems to be genuinely having fun inside dumb narratives, and he's actually a very funny guy (as in Under Siege).  This movie ultimately fails not because of its utter low quality story, effects, etc., but because it gives more camera time to unknown actors than it does to its star.  There is no reason to ever see this movie.",1243123200,,1462,4.592307692307692
3698175,2,B001MLZNKS,"This week's feature for your pal, Sid the Elf was a genuine stinker called Against the Dark. We know what you're thinking: Sid, this was a Seagal movie. You love Seagal movies. He could release a DVD series called ""Seagal's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives"" and you'd pre-order it on Amazon like 8 months in advance(absolutely correct, by the way). How can you give this movie 2 stars? Well, apparently Seagal got confused(or really really wasted)during filming of this movie and only showed up enough to be in a little over 5 minutes of the film. Sid has heard that Seagal actually double booked at the time of filming and was also shooting an instructional video on proper technique of getting the most out of your Chini Buffett experience co-starring Santa and From.

Anyway, the film was a future world that has been decimated by vampires. Seagal is the leader of a kill squad that teams up with the few surviving citizens to try to take down the vampires and save the world. Good times ensue when we see the power of The Rock's cousin/stunt double.

This film was more horror than anything and it was pretty gory. It scared us right out of the stocking, but not because the film was actually scary. We are terrified that Seagal will make a habit out of marketing himself as the star of a film then only appearing in it for 5 minutes. Then where will Sid get all of his unintentional comedy from?! Don't do it Dutch Sr.

3698176,1,B001MLZNKS,"This Movie was done in the movie ""I am Legend"" background. A complete total waste of a movie. This movie could have been done without the hunters in it. Steven's fight scenes was pretty much it dies and he poses. The other male hunter was more impressive.

As i watched the movie, I assumed the hunters was immune. Why else would you fight close combat (without gloves) where blood of the infected will splatter on you. Also tryin to understand why the hunters want to hurry and get done if they do not know about the bombing.

The movie just made no sense. They would run down a hallway, encounter something then turn and go back the way they came (Nothing pursuing them). Strength in numbers but they kept seperating. If they survived this long, why are they suddenly trusting. for some reason they get in easily BUT they have to go out a different way. Going through an a place where any moment you can get attacked, Yet no one is carrying a single weapon (at least a knife).

The infected evolving? After seeing steven's lame fight scenes. I really did not care. The infected did not even plan some elabrate plan. If i was infected and kept my wits about me, I would try to go with them. Total Worthless movie.",1238976000,2,1214,4.434977578475336
