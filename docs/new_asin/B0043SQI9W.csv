Amongst the hilarity, he manages to present a strong testimony for Jesus Christ too!  I would recommend this video to EVERYONE!!",1292630400,11,299,4.6923076923076925
4257418,5,B0043SQI9W,"I thought that there were no more good comedians. I realize I was wrong. Tim Hawkins will be known as one of the finest comedians of all time. Unless you are a raunchy person. I have never seen a more creative and complex creative comedian who respects his audience.  Thank You Tim Hawkins,,, Sincerely, William",1292112000,,311,4.654545454545454
4257419,5,B0043SQI9W,"I love Tim Hawkin's blend of comedy and music.  He is a very gifted musician in his own right, but to be able to blend it with comedy takes talent!  This DVD is well produced and thoroughly entertaining.  Plus, you don't need to be embarrassed about watching it with your children.  It is so refreshing to see a comedian who doesn't need to resort to vulgarity to make people laugh.",1292025600,,382,4.414285714285715

4257422,4,B0043SQI9W,"We own every movie Tim Hawkins has ever made. He is so funny and his comedy is good for the whole family. At the beginning of the show I was rolling...he was so funny! However, he repeated a few jokes off his other movies and some of his songs are not as funny as his jokes. Despite a few set-backs, I would definitely recommend that you buy this!",1290470400,6,347,4.117647058823529
4257423,5,B0043SQI9W,Love this guy!  I've actually seen him live....and I almost prefer the DVD because I could see him better!  Ha!  All of his DVDs are well made and are really fun to watch.  What I think I like most about Tim is that he's clean and funny.  The whole family can sit down and watch him and laugh.,1289952000,29,293,3.9827586206896552
4257424,5,B0043SQI9W,"I first saw Tim Hawkins on Bananas Comedy, and I loved his style of clean comedy and funny songs.  I don't think I ever saw his second Bananas appearance, but I did see his DVDs (Full Range of Motion, and I'm No Rockstar.)  Funny mix of songs and clean Christian comedy.  I saw a few clips here and there for this show Insanitized and I laughed hysterically.  I watched the DVD and I laughed even more!  Again, nice mix of funny songs and some very funny stand-up!

By the way, there's a tiny bit of overlap between DVDs, but here it's pretty much new stuff which is awesome for someone like Tim Hawkins.  Keep bringing the funny, but in entirely new ways.  A few bits that stand out (this is referencing the Chapter Menu foldout within the DVD: The Government Can (funny but too true song), 3rd Wheel (start-out song on this DVD), Unwashed masses, Bad candy (yep, we've all had bad candy come Halloween time), and a few more tracks later in the show that talks about his kids.  A hysterically funny bit is when he talks about stuff being in the Bible, and when he talks about the Precious Moments Bible not illustrating specific moments.

There's a song he does called I'm a Christian.  It's a serious song, and it kind of threw me off (not because it was a bad song or anything, I just wasn't expecting it), but it was a lovely, nice song.  Then he closes it out with a song called Twinkie.  It's a reference to a bit about churches and sermons.

All in all, this was an awesome hour and thirteen minutes of clean Christian comedy.  Very recommended for fans of Tim Hawkins, and/or clean comedy.",1288137600,91,1597,4.402730375426621

He probably would be on par with Conan O'Brien. Great humorists but not stage-ready enough to get by on the actual stage. If Tim wrote a book, or a screen play, or was on a panel discussing something, then I would definitely consider watching it. But on stage, I don't believe I would ever encourage anyone to ever pay to see him. Watch it online for free.",1417478400,,524,4.303030303030303

It's great to have a comedy routine that you don't have to wonder whether you'll need brain bleach after watching it. No cussing, no crude jokes - you CAN be funny and clean at the same time.

Sure wish he had closed captions or subtitles, the music gets loud and it's sometimes difficult to understand him without turning the volume up, which is irritating with the music.",1401062400,,418,4.4868421052631575

Maybe younger kids think this kind of thing is funny, but I just find it crass. I was also surprised by the political song mocking the government. We all do it, but in this context it seems inappropriate. Otherwise, I think the songs are the best part of this routine. (""Oh, oh, oh... the dog's on fire!"")",1397779200,,759,5.440677966101695

4257517,5,B0043SQI9W,"My family and I have been Tim Hawkins fans for several years now, especially after seeing him in person at our church in murfreesboro, tn.  The first one of his videos i saw was Cletus take the Reel which was hilarious and i was hooked! He is naturally the funniest person i have ever heard.  I'm serious, he could just stand there and not say anything and you would laugh!  He is truly a gifted comic and musician.  It just goes to show you that there doesn't have to be foul language and crude gestures to be funny.  Every time I hear the song ""I can only imagine, I sing ""I can only eat margarine"" so funny! :-)  The one thing I think there should be added on his performance announcements and DVDs is a warning label:  This performance could be hazardous to you health! Your stomach will ache your head will hurt and you will be completely drained after watching!!  When I watched one of his DVDs recently, I literally had to stop it and rest before I could finish.  I stored up enough endorphins to last a year!  God Bless you Tim for sharing your talent!  Life is stressful enough and we all need to laugh more.

So I went on amazon & randomly picked a comedy & then forgot about it.  So when it arrived I wasn't anxiously waiting or anything.  One night our family decided to pop it in as we wan't to see a dvd that we hadn't seen before.  I'm so glad we did!  Some of this went over the kids' heads, but my husband & I thought it was funny, but at least we could watch this as a family!  Our teens had some great, deep, healing belly laughs too.  We're now Tim Hawkins fans & when he came to our area last year the kids begged to go - resulting in more fun family time!  We even brought my mother & she's a fan now too.  If you're real & can laugh at this crazy world in general then Tim will help you to find more to laugh at - he sure did for us.

My Dad received this DVD as a gift from my Aunt, and we all watched it together as a family at my Brother's house.

4257562,5,B0043SQI9W,"I discovered Tim Hawkins a couple of years ago and soon bought the Full Range of Motion DVD. I thought that was really funny and in this, his comedy has really progressed. He also does more music in this one.
Starts off with about 5 songs and then goes into it. I felt on ""full range..."" Tim took a short time to get going but on insanitized, he goes straight into it. I was in absolute hysterics watching this and it lasted all the way through.
Tim adds a serious moment in the middle when he covers Bon Jovi's ""wanted dead or alive"". He changes the lyrics to reflect his beliefs and is a really nice touch.
This is a great DVD, Tim is energetic throughout and i love the fact you can watch his stuff knowing he's not going to start swearing or being rude and crude. Proof that great comedy doesn't have to be offensive!",1340841600,2,821,4.235668789808917

4257586,3,B0043SQI9W,"My husband and I love the clean comedy of Tim Hawkins. He takes the normal life and brings some 'crazy funny' to it that can bring laughter tears to your eyes. This video's pretty good, but I just didn't find myself laughing out loud nearly as much as with his other 2 DVDs: I'm No Rockstar and Full Range of Motion. I have loaned out the 2 mentioned DVDs SEVERAL times to friends, but I can't say that this one will make my loan rotation. I'm fairly certain it will just sit on my shelf. Sorry, Tim.",1312156800,2,500,4.164948453608248
4257587,5,B0043SQI9W,"Tim Hawkins Insanitized is a follow up show to I'm No Rockstar and Full Range of Motion. Tim Hawkins is back to his funniest best with song paradies, one liners and some of the funniest CLEAN material in the Comedy world.

I first discovered Tim on YouTube and found his stuff a bit left of centre (Far Side comic type left of centre) and very funny. As Tim has stated in his shows that he is a Christian comedian but not all of his material is specifically Christian...but he does not hide his christianity either. Don't let that make you switch off because the guy is a crack-up.

In short I recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh.

Get this DVD",1311638400,,658,4.333333333333333
4257588,4,B0043SQI9W,I saw a few clips of this guy online and he got me rolling! I decided to get this dvd for my dad for Fathers Day and it was just as funny and clean as I had hoped it would be. It even made my usually serious-minded dad laugh out loud! I would recommend this for family enertainment and good laughs.,1310515200,7,298,3.901639344262295
4257589,5,B0043SQI9W,"Tim Hawkins is as goofy as ever in this DVD. Hilarious jokes, facial expressions, and parody songs add up to an insanely funny stand-up routine. We also appreciate the Christian flavor of this show -- it comes out more clearly than it did in some of his others.",1310083200,3,261,4.458333333333333
4257590,5,B0043SQI9W,"This will make ANYBODY laugh! Great DVD and a must have for your collection. We play it when we have friends over from all walks of life and everyone loves it. Good stuff! Clean, yet very funny.",1309651200,3,194,4.27027027027027

4257592,1,B0043SQI9W,"This was my first time viewing Tim Hawkins stand up routine. I thought he was going to sing and play the guitar through the whole show instead of doing comedy.  He was hit and miss with being funny. At one point, I found myself balancing my checkbook during the show. His other shows maybe funnier, but based on this one, I won't be getting another dvd of him.",1304812800,3,360,4.294117647058823
4257593,5,B0043SQI9W,I've seen Tim's work on youtube and on TV.  His video is great.  I'm going to order the other ones soon.  Amazon has a great price as well.  Half of what you will pay elsewhere even with the shipping included.  As a Christian myself I appreciated his unique way of sharing his faith with the world.  Good humor without the garbage.,1302480000,2,331,4.344262295081967
4257594,5,B0043SQI9W,"After owning this DVD for only two weeks, the whole family has watched it twice
and my teenage children have watched it 3 times.  We had never seen or even heard
of Tim Hawkin's comedy routines before; I found his DVD by ""Googling""--""clean, family
friendly comedians"".  We couldn't be more pleased with this purchase; we laughed
our way through the whole DVD and now plan to purchase his other DVDs (as long as there
is not alot repeat material on them).  We hope Tim will continue putting out quality
routines like this one.",1300492800,,525,4.623655913978495

This DVD has no old or reused jokes, stories, songs, etc. from his other two or three DVD's. I am not the best at writing reviews, I may be redumnet or I maybe pulling a jake harper. I would watch this DVD again. Of course I would watch Tim's other DVDs again. What I am saying is I am happy with my purchase of this DVD.",1297555200,,468,4.0978260869565215

He is a Christian comedian which makes his acts fun for the whole family.  Fantastic!  In this day and age, to be funny without being vulgar is a huge accomlishment.

4257598,5,B0043SQI9W,"Senior Hawkins has another great video with this addition.  He shows off a lot more of his singing skills.  I've read other reviews that didn't like the musical parts so much, but it was a nice change of pace and really showcased that he is a very accomplished musician as well.  I love this the most because it is a video that I can watch with my whole family.  Tim provides plenty of jokes and humor for all age groups while keeping it clean.",1297123200,,444,4.25
4257599,5,B0043SQI9W,....the kind of comedy that you can watch with the whole family.  This guy is the real deal.  I've seen him live a couple times and have a few of his videos.  He ranks right up there with the likes of Brad Stine and Ken Davis.  Comedy is an art.  He proves that you can be hysterically funny and not have to cuss or throw off-color jokes to do it.,1296604800,,347,3.9
4257600,5,B0043SQI9W,"This is utterly hilarious! Some jokes/songs repeated from previous DVD's, but still thoroughly enjoyable! Definitely worth the money.

LOVE this comedian, and how clean he keeps his jokes! No embarrassing moments while watching this with my teens, and I really appreciate that!",1295827200,,277,5.595238095238095
4257601,5,B0043SQI9W,"Tim Hawkins scores again. Tim adds to his credibility as a seriously funny entertainer. This video is clean and hilarious. But you should take warning. If you have ever lost control of bodily functions due to long fits of laughter, then you better put plastic on your couch cushions and have a spare change of clothes handy. Because this video will make you laugh until you cry. The music videos added in the bonus feature section are stand alone quality and worth the cost of the DVD by themselves. My entire family loves this video. That includes my three teenagers.

If you like good clean humor, this is for you. If you like humorous song lyrics combined with excellent musicianship, then this video is for you.

One real word of caution: If Christian values or the Christian worldview offends you, then you should pass up this one.",1295481600,,836,4.680272108843537

4257603,5,B0043SQI9W,"Tim Hawkins is way too funny! We laughed so hard! I got this as a gift for my husband but our whole family enjoyed it. It is refreshing to watch a comedian that I don't have to turn off because of bad language. Tim Hawkins takes from real life and reminds us to laugh about it! Just thinking about cereal makes me laugh now! You have to watch it to know what I am talking about. Thanks for the laughs, Tim!",1294617600,,406,4.0246913580246915

I would Highly recommend for teenage veiwing-mine can't get enough of Tim Hawkins",1294185600,,388,4.47887323943662
4257606,5,B0043SQI9W,"Our family really enjoys Tim Hawkins' humor, so of course, we were all looking forward to his latest DVD, anticipating a great time.  We were certainly not disappointed!  His third concert video is every bit as hilarious as the first two, and the only ""serious"" portion (his song, ""I'm a Christian"") was wonderful.

Holding our stomachs with the pain of laughing so hard is certainly a pain I can deal with.  His observations on life's idiotic moments -- as well as the mundane -- are all the funnier because they are things we've all experienced at one time or another.  The ""bad Halloween candy"" segment had me transported right back to childhood, the memories of throwing away popcorn balls and those awful, stale peanut butter taffy things as sharp as if it happened just yesterday.

Go, Tim!  Can't wait for the next one.",1294012800,20,826,4.734265734265734

This guy is good.  The hilarity comes in the form of everyday circumstances we can all relate to. I have never watched a comedy dvd where I laughed through it's entirety.
