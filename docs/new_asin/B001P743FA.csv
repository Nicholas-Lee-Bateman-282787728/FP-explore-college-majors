8332275,5,B001P743FA,"I've done a lot of yoga DVDs. I was skeptical about this one... thought it might look too focused on the exercise moves and not enough on breath and such. Turned out that this is an excellent DVD. I liked the instructor's style, attention to the breath, even the way she stood and moved. She incorporated a great shoulder stretch I'd never done before... but that felt so good that it's going to be part of my yoga practice starting NOW.  Also, the hour session flew by. (Was it really an hour?) This one's a keeper.",1312070400,,516,4.375
