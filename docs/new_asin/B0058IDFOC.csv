8611684,5,B0058IDFOC,"When my husband initially told me he heard of this DVD series from a friend and wanted to order it I was skeptical, however, after viewing just the first portion my cynicism vanished and was replaced with curiosity to see more and eventually relief.  I was so glad to be learning along with him strategies to assist us with what is going to be the most important job in our lives.  I am much less nervous about having a baby after completing the DVD series.  It was so helpful to see other couples talking about issues that we experience in our marriage and even more enlightening to hear about issues we will encounter soon once the baby comes.  Thanks to the DVDs and exercises, my husband and I are now on the same page on issues I didn't even know existed and I can honestly say I feel better prepared to be a great mother and wife.  I would highly recommend the Family Foundations DVD series to any expectant parents.",1353801600,,922,4.4
8611685,5,B0058IDFOC,"We found this to be very helpful and unique. It has helped us talk about what was in the back of our minds about the kind of family we wanted, but never really knew what the other was thinking.  It was good to hear what we thought about things.  And the scenes in the DVDs of other families are really great because you get to see a lot of different ways of being parents and creating a family.  It helped us get a lot out on the table and we're now closer and more understanding with each other than before (not that we had any big problems before).  The concepts are really helpful, and the exercises are fun.  When I told my mom about this, she said she wished she had something like that when they were pregnant with me.  Its really a lot of material too.  It was a little challenging to get through it all because my husband works evenings at a restaurant and I work days, but we made time for it on the weekends because we knew we're going to get a lot busier soon!",1353801600,,971,4.105820105820106
8611686,5,B0058IDFOC,"I was happy to receive the DVDs in the mail earlier than expected (Amazon said they were on back order, but I got them 3 days after placing the order).  I have been trying to soak up as much information about parenthood, since this will be our first.  This program is really nice in that it gets you, as a couple, to discuss and plan for things that you might not think about discussing.  There are workbooks that help you keep track of your ideas and your wants for your child... It was really good to know that Chad (my husband) and I are on the same page with most things, and that we are having good conversations about what to expect.  It has been much better than just reading the different books we have each read, because we are doing this TOGETHER and it seems that is what parenthood is about.",1310601600,,803,4.2631578947368425
8611687,5,B0058IDFOC,"I wasn't so interested when my wife suggested we buy this, but it has made a big difference for us.  And for our child.  It wasn't perfect.  Like the hosts are kind of cheesy sometimes, but the material helped us a lot and that's what counts.  We argue and bicker a lot less than some of our friends who we've watched become parents.  I know I have more patience with our son than I thought I would.  We watched the DVDs before birth, and then picked up where we left off with the post-birth DVDs that were included.  I definitely recommend this for most couples..I'm buying a set for my sister who just became pregnant.  Its worth the price too given that there are 6 DVDs and a brief workbook.",1309305600,2,695,4.292307692307692
