if you really love anything to do with Monty Python, meaning John Cleese and Graham Chapman who were the writers of this show. as a kid i could not get enough of this then Monty Python came on and it was just as funny. years later when i got my copy of Doctor in the house and i saw who the writers were i was not stunned at all. it something that everyone should see. its a bit dated due to it being made in the early 60's.  it should have been made into the dvd set.
another great brit show that the ameraicans have not stolen yet.",1261958400,,672,3.765957446808511
8166221,5,0773351876,"'Doctor in the House', begun in 1969, was a long-running series (if one includes the derivatives of 'Doctor at Large', 'Doctor at Sea', 'Doctor on the Go', 'Doctor Down Under', and even the early 1990s 'Doctor at the Top') focusing upon a group of not-so-serious medical students at the mythical St. Swithin's Hospital school.  The central characters of Michael Upton (Barry Evans) and Duncan Warring (Robin Nedwell) form a band of students whose lack of diligence in their studies is duly matched with their obsession at having fun in the swinging-sixties mindset of London.  Of course, this is a made-for-television series, so there are definite limits to the humour - in typical British fashion, there are flashes of understated brilliance coupled with over-the-top, Monty-Python-esque kinds of hilarity.

This only makes since, given that Monty Python veteran Graham Chapman was writer for many of the episodes of this series (and John Cleese gets a credit for the opening episode).  The first episode sees Michael Upton being introduced to the school during the examination, which, despite a lackluster performance answering the question, 'Why do you want to be a doctor?' he nonetheless gains admittance.

The six episodes in this collection all come from the first season (all aired originally in 1969) on three video cassettes.  In addition to Upton and Warring, recurring characters such as Stuart-Clark (a student obliged to stay in school given the terms of his inheritance, played by Geoffrey Davies) and Professor Loftus (played by the distinguished and unflappable Ernest Clark) are introduced.

This is an early look at Brit-coms, predating shows such as Fawlty Towers that have become staples of the genre.  'Doctor in the House' has had some play on PBS and other networks in the United States, but never attracted a huge following there.  This is a London Weekend Television production (not a BBC production), for those who recognise a difference (Benny Hill was a staple of the LWT/ITV stock, too).

This is an incredibly funny series; unfortunately, not all of the best episodes are contained in this collection.  Both the opening episode to the series and its follow-up are included, and these are likely the best of the lot.  Alas, as of now, there is no DVD release of this, either selected episodes or the entire lot.  Perhaps someday...

8166222,4,0773351876,"Doctor in the House is a light, somewhat zany 1969 British comedy centring around a group of first-year medical students, and heaven help the unwitting public should they ever be unleashed to practise medicine on them.  Not only are they lazy, unmotivated and inept, but they are severely lacking in maturity and professionalism.  However, as one student is already in his fifth year as a first-year student (a provision in a will allows him 1000 pounds a year for so long as he's a student) while the rest are content to ogle girlie magazines, and spend copious amounts of time in the pub or playing pranks on one another, their graduation does not appear to be of imminent concern.  The only student who appears to be at all studious (though somewhat clueless) is Michael Upton, the main character in the series.  Surrounded as he is by this hapless lot, however, it quickly becomes obvious that he doesn't stand much of a chance.
While this sorry group may make for lousy doctors, they do make for entertaining comedy.  In fact, the first episode in this boxed set (which contains six 25-minute episodes) was written by John Cleese (Fawlty Towers, Monty Python) and Graham Chapman (Monty Python).  Though this episode is, at least in my opinion, the funniest in the set (and my personal favourite), the other episodes are still really cute, and it strikes me that this series must have been fairly modern for its time.  All in all, an enjoyable collection.",1016582400,26,1459,4.788844621513944
8166223,4,0773351876,"I agree with the guy who said it is a ""good start."" I remember many of the episodes and they were much funnier than these. However, I am grateful to finally find some of this great Brit series in video. I have searched high and low for more of the videos.",1013990400,9,255,4.019607843137255
8166224,5,0773351876,"This 60s & 70s Britcom is a rib-tickler from the onset.  The antics of the medical students at St. Swithins are timeless and can be appreciated by everyone.  Although this is only a small segment of the series at its beginning available on NTSC format, the rest of the series is now available on PAL format in the UK and hopefully will be available in NTSC soon. After all, laughter is still the best medicine!",1012089600,10,410,4.453333333333333

However, they are funny, I just feel there are actually more humourous episodes than the ones they have compiled.",1011657600,8,307,4.685185185185185
