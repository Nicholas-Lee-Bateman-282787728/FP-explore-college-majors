The majority of matches on this collection are from ECW(and for good reason). During the wraparounds, RVD gives his insights and thoughts which I found interesting. There are a number of extra features including a ""before they were stars"" segment on Rob Van Dam.

Rob Van Dam is one of the most breath-taking and thrilling wrestlers with his death-defying moves that only RVD can pull off, and with such splendor. This DVD set gives a nice chronicle of his career and what RVD is all about.",1351814400,,653,4.6695652173913045

On this set there are great athletic contests between Van Dam and others. My personal favorite ECW matchup is Van Dam/Sabu vs The Eliminators. This is my favorite old school ECW match on here because RVD and Sabu were getting booed in the beginning of the match. But as time went on and the fans started seeing their athletic abilities, they started cheering them on. The ECW fans were respectable. They respected what the superstars did in the ring,whether you were a heel or not. Alot of great matches here. But just like I said about the Benoit DVD, Van Dam loses a bit of matches on here. Also, (with him moving to TNA they probably won't) but I wish they'd have one more Van Dam DVD. I'd want it to be like the HBK: My Journey DVD. Where RVD talks about how the business effected him and so on and so forth. He did it on this set, but I'd like to see alot more.",1285632000,,1026,4.266666666666667

So chanted the loyal ECW faithful years ago.  I'm chanting it because I've come across a superb DVD from a genre I usually dislike.  I usually don't get into match compilations like this, where you just watch some matches with brief introductions to each.  I'd rather watch a biography feature, with promos and matches as the Extras.

But this time, I'm going to make an exception, because ROB VAN DAM: ONE OF A KIND is truly exceptional.

Before I get into the matches, I want to first talk about the format.  As with Ric Flair's ULTIMATE COLLECTION or Rey Mysterio's BIGGEST LITTLE MAN, RVD speaks about each match before it's shown to us.  The difference is that rather than just little tidbits of information, RVD speaks very candidly and gives some real history to each of the selections.  For example, when introducing his ECW TV Title Match against Bam Bam Bigelow, RVD details the physics of his famous top-rope assaults into the crowd.  Those iconic images that ECW programs use even today are appreciated even more after learning how RVD could've killed himself.

Another good example of RVD's out-of-character behavior is when he bluntly claims that the WWF Hardcore Title doesn't exist because he did it so much better than anybody else.  After watching the three WWE matches on this set, I won't disagree.

Although a couple of the matches aren't awesome, they're still good for historical purposes.  The first contest on the DVD is a 1993 WCW bout against Scotty Flamingo (aka ""Raven"").  Even though the match itself isn't anything to write home about, it's important for us to understand the origins of ""Robby V"".  Same deal with his ECW debut against Axl Rose - ECW was tough on guys not yet established, and they respected Van Dam's early tryout.  After watching the evolution of his skills, I'll always believe that Rob Van Dam is one of the true pioneers when it comes to in-ring performance.

Just watch his incredible workrate against Jerry Lynn at the LIVING DANGEROUSLY PPV!  I don't think I've ever seen faster chain-wrestling anywhere else, not to mention the high-risk spots ECW contests were famous for.  His WWE matches against Jeff Hardy (INVASION) & Chris Jericho (KING OF THE RING) -- and a third one I'll get to later -- still stand out in an era where the talent pool was at its best.

What I also appreciate about the ONE OF A KIND DVD is that even though RVD is very honest, his words never take away from the match.  As funny as Foley/Sandman was, I couldn't understand why Mick Foley put that awful match on his DVD, even for a few laughs.  Van Dam has the rare gift to make us 'believe' in the matches; no wrestling detractor can watch an RVD match and call it ""fake"".

As impressive as this compilation of matches is, WWE really gets brownie points for the Extras!  I enjoyed every bonus material WWE put on here.  There aren't any of RVD's promos, but we still get incredible insight in RVD's success outside of the ring.  There are a couple of featurettes that detail RVD's merchandise and marketting.  The small program on his Jakks action figures is surprisingly interesting, as is the CONFIDENTIAL 2002 story on how RVD gets his costumes.  I learned how much RVD's presentation matters as much as it did to The Ultimate Warrior.  Perhaps all WWE superstars go through just as much creation as RVD did.

Another neat bonus is the ""Dream Match"" between Jimmy Snuka and Rob Van Dam.  I think this was first broadcast on CONFIDENTIAL back in 2003; regardless, I never realized how similar RVD and Superfly are to each other.  Basically, several WWE wrestlers and executives break down who's got better charisma, the better frog splahs, and the tougher physique.  Nice comparisons and contrast between a modern superstar and a classic legend.

The absolute best Extra on the ONE OF A KIND DVD is the awesome Chicago Ladder Match between RVD and Christian (the Intercontinental Champion).  This bonus match is better than any of the matches on the 2 discs, and deserved a spot on WWE's LADDER MATCH DVD that came out in spring 2007.  Simply put, if for no other reason, buy this DVD just to see this RAW classic. The All-State Arena's greatest gift is Austin/Hitman at WRESTLEMANIA 13; this 2003 gem is a close second.

I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  The match set is an overall strong collection, RVD's introductions are just as valuable as the physical matches themselves, and the bonuses are all worth repeat viewings!  Like the performer himself, RVD's DVD is a complete package.

ROB VAN DAM: ONE OF A KIND lives up to its name.",1215907200,,4637,4.717661691542289
2193841,5,B0006SSNVY,"This is not your typical WWE superstar DVD featuring a bloated documentary enhanced by Vince McMahon's historical revisionism.  It is a goldmine of RVD's best matches handpicked by the man himself.  You see the evolution of RVD from green rookie to ECW daredevil to WWE superstar.  RVD's commentary sets up each match.  If you are an RVD fan or simply a wrestling fan, buy this DVD.",1210723200,,382,4.742424242424242
2193842,3,B0006SSNVY,"I found this DVD of RVD to be just another one of those quick cash in's that WWE are doing so well lately. It's not a bad DVD, but it just should have had a lot more put into it.

This DVD is great for those have followed RVD's career and just want to have some great matches on DVD, but for someone who has no idea or who this guy is, or how he has become what he has over a certain period, this DVD offers nothing new.

The only things I did find interesting where when RVD was a kid he was on a WWF show to kiss Ted Dibiase's feet, and that he holds an actual world record for inventing some splits weight lifting thingie-majig.

It would have been nice to also see how RVD ended up in certain companies, I mean, it shows his WCW, ECW and WWE debuts, but it does not actually tell or show of how he ended up there and why he left so's much as just a couple of simple words like, ""and then i went to (whoever) to work"".

It mentioned nothing about the demise of ECW and did not really tell well how RVD really was one of the top performers ECW had.. sure, it mentions it, but does not really go into any detail of it, then the demise of ECW is pretty much not mentioned, and just cuts to the WWE debut as an official memeber of the WWE roster.... i'd like to have known a little of what happened in between the end of ECW and officially joining WWE.

Apart from that.. I did enjoy most of the matches on this DVD, but one other thing i thought was dodgey is the second disc goes for abou 40 mins, they could have easily added another 3 hours to this thing, and not just thrown in some bonus features that you will watch maybe once if you are not a die hard fan of RVD and can't get enough of watching him. There are 3 bonus matches also in the extras, but those could easily have been made part of the feature.

I hope the WWE do another RVD DVD in future and get it right, and include more information and not just another DVD for the fans who know about him already and just want to have some of his matches in there DVD collections.

Overall, I'd really only recommend this title if you are an RVD fan and are familiar with him already, if your someone who never heard of him till he joined the WWE, you may enjoy the matches, but you won't really learn much about who RVD is and how he rose to the top as one of the best in the business.",1191801600,,2343,3.961783439490446
2193843,4,B0006SSNVY,"Well worth what I paid for it. It has the pieces from WWE Confidential, a very substantial history...it was well put together. I'm not gonna spoil any of the content itself, but his ECW footage/story/experience seemed to me like an extension of the ""Rise And Fall"" DVD (which is TOP NOTCH)without overlapping anything. If you're collecting wrestling DVD's like I am, this is one you won't regret buying. I just wonder when that Al Snow DVD's coming out...",1184457600,,455,4.846153846153846
2193844,4,B0006SSNVY,"WWE really outdid themselves on this RVD bio. It does a great job of explaining RVD toning down his moveset since coming to WWE. It even talks about RVD's WCW experiance without bashing it.

What sucks is the wrestlers theme music is dubbed over. But thats the case with alot of new wrestling dvd's due to copyright issues.

The selection of matches are great but could have been better. From ECW it shows his matches against Jerry Lynn, Balls Bahoney, Bam Bam Bigelow, Sabu, Lance Storm and a few others. He had so many great bouts in ECW its a shame they didn't include more.

His WWE matches are well selected: His matches with Christian, Jeff Hardy, Y2J and a few others.

All in all his best WWE matches ARE on this 2 dics dvd set, his best ECW matches ARE NOT. It has some good ones but they left out alot but a great job anyway.

I'd recommend this for any RVD or ECW fan.",1173312000,,879,4.271084337349397
2193845,3,B0006SSNVY,"If you want to know about RVD the person, this isn't the DVD for you. We see a but of stuff on his life in general and a little bit of his childhood, but not much. If you are buying this, you are buying it for the matches.

RVD VS Pat Rose(WCW)- RVD was still a bit green to the business here, but we see some signature moves of his. Rare that a wrestler finds himself so early in his career. 6/10

RVD VS Scotty Flamingo(Raven)(WCW)- Again, not a very good match. Both Raven and RVD have improved greatly since this match. 6/10

RVD VS Axl Rotten(ECW)- The only average ECW match on the DVD. Not much to say on the match, just that RVD adapted to the hardcore style fast. 6.5/10

RVD VS Sabu(ECW)- I believe this was their first match together, and you can see their chemistry from early on. This is that match that proved RVD could really be something. 8/10

RVD VS Sabu(ECW)- One of their many rematches. A great match with plenty of high spots and not so many slow moments. 9/10

RVD & Sabu VS The Eliminators- A phenominal tag match involving all sorts of weopons and cool tag team spots. The length and false finishes really help this match too. 9.5/10

RVD VS Jeff Hardy(RAW)- Just in this to show RVD's WWE debut. Not much more than a squash match. 5/10

RVD VS Tommy Dreamer(ECW VS WWF Flag Match)- One of my personal favorite matches on the DVD. The ECW crowd was like an uncontrolable fire at all times, but know one could tame them handle them like Dreamer and RVD. The crowd was wild, the match was great, and all sorts of characters got involved ECW style. 8.5/10

RVD VS Bam Bam Bigelow(ECW TV Title)- Another great ECW match. Many claim Bam Bam is the best big man wrestler ever. Not sure if I agree, but he and RVD could go. 8/10

RVD VS Jerry Lynn(ECW TV Title)- Jerry Lynn VS RVD was always a big draw, and this is their best match, and also argued to be the best match in ECW history. 10/10

Balls Mahoney- Not gonna talk about this one. Not saying it isn't a good match, but I always fell asleep watching it late at night.

RVD VS Jerry Lynn(ECW)- Another good RVD VS Jerry Lynn match, but nowhere close to the previous one. 8/10

RVD VS Jeff Hardy(WWF Hardcore Title)- Very impressive match considering it was on PPV. Regular TV doesn't get this exteme anymore. 8.5/10.

RVD VS Chris Jericho(King of the Ring) A good showing between Jericho and RVD. Despite it being a good match, I bet they could have done better. 7.5/10

RVD VS Christian(RAW Ladder Match; IC Title)- Again, free TV just doesn't do this stuff anymore. Great ending, great moves, and great bumps. Kudos. 8.5/10",1147824000,5,2600,4.365145228215767
2193846,5,B0006SSNVY,"This is a great UMD featuring 7 of some of the best matches RVD has had. Throughout each match shows the progression throughout his career.

This UMD has no extra features which does let it down a little but the matches are good and is a great edition to WWE UMD's.

WCW

(WCW Worldwide)

Robbie V (RVD) Vs. Scotty Flamingo (Raven) - This is a very early match featuring both a young RVD and Raven. This match although short is good and showcases RVD's short period in WCW. 7/10

ECW

(ECW Hardcore TV)

RVD Vs. Axl Rotten - This match is RVDs first in ECW and isn't a hardcore affair but is still good and shows how ECW didn't always need hardcore matches. There are some good moves and is a decent match but is put on the UMD to show his ECW debut. 7/10

(ECW Crossing The Line Again)

RVD & Sabu Vs. The Eliminators - This is a great hardcore tag match and shows the brilliant teaming of RVD and Sabu and how similar they are. This is a brilliant brawl which had many false finishes, one of better matches on UMD. 8.5/10

(ECW Barely Legal)

RVD Vs. Lance Storm - God Storm looks wierd and definatley isn't used to ECW fans (just look at chairshots very weak). Still a good match with some good moves and high flying, RVD shows why he is MR PPV. 8/10

(ECW Guilty As Charged)

RVD Vs. Jerry Lynn - These two always had good matches and this is no exception in the dying days of ECW. This isn't their best but is still great and that Van Terminator seems to hurt like hell. 9/10

(WWE Invasion)

RVD Vs. Jeff Hardy - RVDs first PPV match in WWE and shows he is the whole f'n show. Brilliant hardcore match showcasing the best of both men and some great moves involved, although not as good as the ladder match at Summerslam this is still great. 9.5/10

(WWE Raw)

RVD Vs. Christian - What a hidden gem!!! I didn't even know about this match and its the best match on the UMD and they saved it till last! Both men take severe punishment and prove they are two of the best in the business. 10/10",1140825600,2,1995,4.194225721784777
2193847,5,B0006SSNVY,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2013.

No matter what you call him, he's exactly what his one time theme music & DVD title says in that he was one of a kind as far as his athletic skill, presence in the ring, innovative offense, and overall in-ring ability resulting in many singles & tag team title reigns including World Championships & a history making reign as a World Television Champion...that man is (point your thumbs at yourself) Rob Van Dam.  Now the DVD set is in the format of a match anthology from his career in WCW & ECW & ECW which hosted by Josh Mathews with Rob Van Dam having comments on various subjects with video clips in between each match on various subjects such as WCW, his ECW debut, relationship with Sabu, story behind the names ""Mr. Monday Night"" & ""The Whole F'n Show"", his record setting Van Dam Lift, the importance of the ECW Television Championship, injuries, his various finishing moves, WWE Hardcore Championship, and the difference between wrestling in WWE compared to ECW.

Matches Include:
Robbie V vs. Scotty Flamingo - This short match last a little over 3 minutes just showing Rob in his early days wrestling barefoot while showcasing such offense that is typical of him & others today but rarely seen during that time such as his martial arts kicks, backflip, springboard crossbody, and split legged moonsault.  The bigger story behind this match though happens around 3 years later when these men would become big name attractions in ECW with Robbie V becoming Rob Van Dam & Flamingo being known as Raven.
""WCW Worldwide"" Feb. 93

vs. Axl Rotten - This was RVD's ECW debut match that saw him showcasing his unique style early on with such offense as the split legged dropdown, japanese armdrag, and springboard crossbody while using martial arts strikes while Rotten resulted in his trademark formula of brawling while doing some impactful holds like the t-bone suplex & a clothesline that turned RVD inside out while also mocking his martial arts before RVD recovered showing his cat-like ability & aeral offense with various holds such as the top rope somersault, top rope side kick, and split legged moonsault.  The match itself isn't anything special but it was a showcase for Rob Van Dam to make a positive first impression on the ECW fans which he did.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Jan. 96

vs. Sabu - Sabu was wearing a neck brace which he tossed aside right before the match while RVD had an injured leg which Sabu attempted to go after right away before the top rope broke in the opening minutes but didn't stop Sabu as he still did his moves such as the the triple jump moonsault & suicide dive onto RVD on a guardrail.  The match went into the crowd with both men throwing chairs at each other with RVD being able to execute a legdrop using a chair as they made their way back into the ring with both men using the chair throughout the match for more impactful offense such as RVD money flipped out of the corner onto an open chair & one of the very first Van Daminators while both men showcased very similar offense with Sabu's top rope flip legdrop & RVD's top rope flip dive.  Both men turned out the intensity with such hard hitting offense such as a double jump dive into the crowd, a DDT through a table, coming off the top rope catching the other man in a DDT on the way down, a brainbuster superplex, and the atomic arabian facebuster from the top rope resulting in a match that was just so physical that both men had to be taken to the back on a stretcher.
On a personal note, this was the very first ECW match I ever saw & had me hooked ever since.
Alternative commentary on this match by RVD & Paul Heyman include the story behind the broken ring in this event resulting in the infamous dance by Kimona, RVD's history with Sabu, the ECW audience, his work ethic, and moves he's glad he doesn't do anymore because they're too dangerous.
ECW Hardcore Heaven 96

w/Sabu vs ECW Tag Team Champions Eliminators - Both teams were so evenly matched from the start that they kept trading momentum performing the same offense on each other using quick tags & double teaming while performing stereo moves like splashes & leg lariats.  Sabu & RVD were able to maintain control with their double team offense such at the low dropkick & camel clutch, surfboard & top rope elbow before the brawl went to the outside with Sabu diving into crowd while Eliminators made a comeback with back to back top rope splashes, various combination of kicks, and even preventing Sabu from doing his daredevil attack by kicking the legs from under him.  This was a quality tag team match as both teams were very evenly matches & similar to each other with the addition of tables & ladders & chairs adding another element to the match years before we would ever hear of a T.L.C. match.
ECW Crossing The Line 97

vs. Lance Storm - This was originally suppose to be Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm but RVD replaced Candido after he suffered an injury with Storm always remaining one step ahead in the early exchanges before RVD was finally able to catch him before both men had an aerial attack with holds like the leaping somersault dive, top rope back elbow, and moonsault press on the outside.  RVD got more aggressive to the point where he brought a chair into play & threw it in Storm's face quick like a bullet followed by the running chair dropkick in the corner & frog splash but Storm kept fighting back catching him in submissions like the boston crab into a single crab before using the chair himself for holds like a Tiger Bomb & top rope legdrop onto the open chair.  This was a solid match & they would go on to have better quality matches as Storm still wasn't comfortable with the ECW environment yet (as you could tell by the chairshots he gave) but this was more about the infamous speech afterwords where RVD addressed the crowds chants of ""You Sold Out!""
ECW Barely Legal 97

vs. Jeff Hardy - This was just a quick dominate squash match with RVD using his trademark holds like the somersault dive, split legged moonsault & 5 Star Frog Splash but mainly noteworthy for him getting his nickname of ""Mr. Monday Night"" from Jerry Lawler.
""RAW"" May 97

Flag Match vs. Tommy Dreamer - This wasn't the type of flag match where you had to get your flag off a pole to win the match but just a regular match where the winner was able to raise his company's flag (WWE for RVD & ECW for Dreamer) while it made clear before the match that Dreamer was wrestling with a broken heel to the point where he had to wear a medical boot to compete.  RVD went right after Dreamer's foot & worked over it quickly as the match went into the floor where RVD was able to pull off a springboard somersault off the guardrail before Dreamer was able to catch RVD with a chairshot giving Dreamer an advantage before Bill Alfonzo got involved.  RVD someone was cut over his eye but continued to bring the offense using a chair with such holds like a springboard side kick or top rope backflip into low dropkick in the corner but Dreamer made a comeback giving a receipt for the dropkick & used the chair to block RVD's attempt at his split legged moonsault before catching RVD in the middle of his offense again countering it into a drop DDT from the top, hitting his own Van Daminator, and a piledriver that had RVD's body bounce inches off the mat.  This was a good back & forth match that had everyone getting involved from the wrestlers to the managers & referees to outside associates with a few surprise appearances with the only thing negative here is that the a part of the match was edited for some unknown reason.
ECW November 2 Remember 97

vs. ECW Television Champion Bam Bam Bigelow - Sabu was already scheduled to face Bigelow for the TV Title at the upcoming PPV so Bill Alfonzo set it up for RVD to face Bigelow in order to soften up Bigelow for the match with Bigelow having a bandage above his eye from a previous match against Sandman.  Bigelow kept catching RVD whenever he went for his offense like a regular kick or frankensteiner & powered him down before working him over with moves like headbutts but RVD continued to try to use the ""hit & run"" offense as he took to the air coming off the top rope with sidekicks & crossbody before the match got taken into the crowd where he took Bigelow down with a frankensteiner off the guardrail & went off the top rope into the crowd onto Bigelow twice.  They made their way back to ringside where Bigelow continued to bring the power to RVD as he powerbombed him onto a ringside table that didn't give causing Bigelow to come off the apron with an elbow through RVD & the table before making their way into the ring where RVD went after that Bigelow's cut over his eye with various kicks as Sabu appeared going after the eye as well but accidentally assisted in history being made in the process.  The match itself was definitely ""power vs. agility"" as Bigelow was a powerful beast causing RVD to take many high risk moves to the point where some of them remained on the opening video of the TV show for a long time afterwords with the result being the start of a historic reign that definitely made RVD a main event attraction.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Apr. 98
[ECW: Path Of Destruction]

ECW Television Championship Match vs. Jerry Lynn - Both men were so evenly matched early on that they had a stalemate before Lynn got the first major hit in after RVD mocked him with a clothesline that sent RVD to the outside followed by catching him with a cannonball off the apron & baseball slide sending RVD into the crowd as Lynn followed him with a springboard crossbody.  RVD came back with his trademark spinning legdrop off on the outside onto Lynn as the match went back into the ring where he brought a chair into the match catching Lynn in a surfboard only to launch him in the air landing on the chair before Lynn countered an attempt at a monkeyflip into a powerbomb onto the chair followed by a reverse DDT & countering the Van Daminator into a legdrop with both holds causing a landing directly on the chair as both men would eventually fight for the chair on the top rope with RVD taking two chairshots & coming back with a Van Daminator that caused Lynn to fall through a table.  This was a very athletic & physical contest that was the ""breakout"" match for Jerry Lynn as he earned the nickname ""The New F'n Show"" after this match.
ECW Living Dangerously 99

vs. Jerry Lynn - This match was a completely different setup than a majority their previous matches in ECW as this one wasn't for a championship, Lynn wasn't a fan favorite at this point in his career & had Cyrus in his corner, and RVD was returning after a long absence without Bill Alfonzo in his corner.  The early exchanges between both men sent them into a stalemate before going over the top to the outside with RVD having his mouth bleeding from going into the guardrails but being able to recover with a moonsault press off the guardrail followed by his trademark corkscrew legdrop onto Lynn on the guardrail.  Both men traded momentum with RVD delivering a backflip splash then second rope moonsault splash, Lynn doing a hard clothesline to RVD's bleeding mouth, RVD's running chair dropkick in the corner, and Lynn catching RVD on top rope with powerbomb onto chair followed by a DDT onto the chair.  This wasn't a classic as their previous battles over the television title but still a high quality encounter that saw both Cyrus & his nemesis getting involved but it mostly remembered as the final original ECW match that a majority of people saw.
ECW Guilty As Charged 01

vs. WWE Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy - ""The more things change, the more they stay the same"" as RVD is once again wrestling in the WWE as a member of ECW against Jeff Hardy just like how he did 4 years earlier except ECW at this time was part of the invasion faction called ""The Alliance"" with WCW while Jeff Hardy was no longer that no-named jobber but established as one half of the Hardy Boyz tag team holding multiple tag team & singles titles in WWE.  Both men traded momentum early on with both men having a stalemate, RVD able to hit rolling thunder, Hardy pushing RVD off the top rope onto the barricade, and Hardy running the barricade for a clothesline only for RVD to catch him with one of his own.  The took the match into the crowd before making it back to ringside with RVD being able to execute his trademark moonsault & corkscrew legdrop while Hardy was able to comeback with a sunset flip to the outside that resulted in RVD being powerbombed off the apron onto the floor as Hardy pulled out a ladder only to be shoved off the top of it onto the ramp.  Hardy introduced a chair with various chairshots to RVD before RVD responded with his Van Daminator that ended up knocking Hardy off the top of the ramp to the floor causing Hardy to be cut above the forehead before the match made it's way back to ring with both men being able to avoid & counter each others signature moves like the split legged moonsault & swanton bomb while hitting their own impactful moves like a DDT & 5 Star Frog Splash.  This was the match you would expect from these two as they both have offense that's almost similar in that they almost come off as daredevils with the amount of high risk moves to not only deliver but take as well.
Invasion 01

vs. Chris Jericho - This was the semi-finals of the King Of The Ring tournament that year as both men same out with the same idea exchanging armdrags & a dropkick at the same time resulting in a stalemate before RVD finally got an advantage with his educated feet & going areal with his somersault dive over the top rope & side kick off the top rope causing Jericho to use dirty tactics to gain advantage with a double arm superplex followed by grounding RVD while still breaking the rules whenever possible such as choking using the ropes & wrist tape as they continued to battle back & forth with various counters & reversals throughout the rest of the match.  This was an average encounter as they seemed to be off at times as their match from the previous Unforgiven PPV was a better quality encounter.
King Of The Ring 02

Ladder Match vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Christian - Christian was in control early before RVD was able to regain momentum with his baseball slide into a ladder & somersault over the ropes onto Christian & the ladder followed by his spinning kick onto Christian laying on the ladder. Christian gave a hard irish whip onto RVD into the ladder in the corner before RVD countered showing some strength of his own by pressing Christian onto the ladder followed by a backwards flip. Hard hits were taken by both men such as Christian being monkeyflipped into a ladder, RVD landing on a ladder after missing the frog splash, and Christian falling & hitting a ladder face first.  With both men being ladder match experts, you got what you expected from a one on one ladder match as there was plenty of hard hits & using the ladder to make moves more impactful.
""RAW"" Sept. 03
[Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

(Bonus) Robbie E vs. Pat Rose - This was RVD's WCW debut in a ""Underdog Challenge"" where two unknown names have a match to get noticed by the WCW officials (similar to the current concept of TNA's Gut Check) as this was mostly just an early display of RVD's unique style that was unseen in WCW during that time with his mix of martial arts kicks, athleticism using moves like the crossbody & split legged moonsault, and basic wrestling ability such as an armbar.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Jan. 93

(Bonus) vs. Sabu - Both men were coming into this match with injures to the point where RVD had a cast on his wrist while Sabu intimidated the ring announcer to make the match with no time limit.  Sabu went after RVD & keeping him grounded with various submissions while attacking RVD's knee before dropkicking RVD off the top rope to the floor & into the crowd where RVD kept getting hit with chairs followed by his triple jump moonsault into the crowd but RVD was finally able to start mounting some offense when he cannonballed himself with a chair onto Sabu on the floor followed by a running hilo over the top to the floor & shoving Sabu off the top through a table.  RVD targeted Sabu's neck heavily with moves like the german suplex, top rope neckbreaker that would in the future be known as the Buff Blockbuster & giotine legdrop but Sabu was still somehow able to put RVD through a table with a flip legdrop & punish RVD with a hanging spike DDT & triple jump moonsault.  Nobody was able to physically bring this much of a fight to Sabu before RVD & this was the beginning of the series that would put him on the map in ECW with the aftermath that ensured this rivalry would continue.
ECW Hostile City Showdown 96

(Bonus) ECW Television Championship Match vs. Balls Mahoney - RVD was originally suppose to defend the title against european wrestler Johnny Smith but he was taken out & replaced with Balls in the main event position of this PPV. Balls started out in control being very physical with his brawling to the point where they went to the outside & in the crowd twice as RVD got some offense in with an early Van Daminator in the crowd & top rope hilo into the crowd before Balls resorted to not only his superior power with holds like a powerbomb & powerslam but also going aerial himself with a legdrop & frog splash himself off the ropes.  A chair was brought into play as RVD used it for a more impactful dropkick & rolling thunder while Balls caught a monkeyflip attempt into a powerbomb on the chair followed by a spike DDT & chairshot that just absolutely knocked RVD out.  This turned out to be a much better match than expected as RVD was able to bring out more from his opposition than they normally would against anyone else during this period as Balls Mahoney had the reputation of just being a ""hardcore chair swinging freak"" but actually showcased athleticism as well.
Alternative commentary with RVD & Paul Heyman talked about the history behind this PPV event, the importance of being the Television Champion, addressing the label of ECW being a ""bingo hall promotion"", Bill Alfonzo, Balls Mahoney's underrated ability, and how RVD was a different type of champion defending against both faces & heels.
ECW Anarchy Rulz 99

Other DVD extras include two vignettes on RVD, a look behind the scenes of the music video for his ""One Of A Kind"" theme song by Breaking Point, a video feature on RVD filmed at the Invasion PPV, his profile from ""Before They Were Superstars"", talking about his WrestleMania moments, various ""Confidental"" stories on the airbrush artist who does his singlets & comparing his frog splash to Eddie Guerrero's & a tour of the Jakks Pacific office & a look at a fantasy match against Jimmy Snuka & answering 10 questions on 'Outside The Ropes', and two hidden ECW promos.

While I question some of the match choices (the Jericho match & editing the Dreamer match), the match quality overall was no different than his frog splash in that it's 5 stars that I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Rob Van Dam, ECW, or just good quality action.",1137628800,11,19185,4.508347725964306
2193848,4,B0006SSNVY,"I love this DVD with a great hardcore matche with Sabu and Jeff Hardy. I also loved his match with Evil Chris Jericho at the VERY LAST King of the Ring. What I mean by ""where's RVD"" is that RVD has been gone since Januray 2005 and he hasn't been seen since (Well during the ECW ppv and as the Last RAW draft pick). Last time we saw him was on SMACKDOWN when Danny Basham hit his ""So CALLED"" bad leg with the steel steps. He's had worst injuries then that. Every RVD website I go to doesn't have any updates on RVD's (so called) bad knee. Anyway this is one of the coolist WWE dvds.",1135900800,,581,4.017241379310345

2193850,4,B0006SSNVY,"Definitely a great dvd, i'm a big fan of Van Dam i think he's one of the most gifted athletes ever in professional wrestling,  and although WWE hasn't seen his best work although he has had great matches during his run, the ECW material is the most memorable. Thank god WWE has the footage from the ECW library to include all of this, and RVD has made it known that he's not the biggest fan of WWE to begin with and its a crime that he's been held back and never even given a World or WWE title run yet. Just go back and watch this man's battles with Jerry Lynn(another star held down heavily in WWE) and you can see RVD at his best with his best opponent. Definitely a great release for any hardcore RVD fan out there, you won't regret it.",1120608000,3,740,4.138888888888889
2193851,5,B0006SSNVY,"This is an awesome DVD set with some really killer matches and extras. Matches are rated out of 5 stars.

Robbie V vs. Pat Rose - This one is ok, it's only on here to show RVD's WCW debut, however he does show us that he was always an amazing athlete by pulling some high-flying moves off **1/2

Robbie V vs. Scotty Flamingo - Once again ok, but only on the DVD to highlight RVD's time in WCW. Here he's taking on a guy who would later be called Raven (for those who didn't know) not much going on, though **

RVD vs. Axl Rotten - Finally, we get to the ECW chapter. A very entertaining match, even though they don't use any weapons. Cool over-the-top flip by RVD ***1/2

RVD vs. Sabu (Hostile City Showdown) - The best RVD/Sabu match, this one will keep you begging for more when it's finally over, lengthy, awesome and crazy *****

RVD vs. Sabu (Hardcore Heaven) - First one's better, but that's not saying this match is any more horrible, some sick bumps taken by Rob and Sabu, both men carried out on stretcher ****1/2

RVD/Sabu vs. The Eliminators - Saturn and Kronus were always a great tag team but so was Rob and Sabu. A great tag team match with some seriously insane double team moves ****

RVD vs. Lance Storm - a really cool match, even though some people don't like it. Weak chair shots by Storm and great chair work by Rob cool finish ***

RVD vs. Jeff Hardy (Raw) - Squash match, only reason it's on here is too capitalize on the ""Mr. Monday Night"" name. Pretty weak match *1/2

RVD vs. Tommy Dreamer (Flag vs. Flag match) - The match is great with some great wrestling by both men, super weak ending ***1/2

RVD vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This match is one of the very best on the DVD Rvd takes some awesome leaps and the way it ends was very creative *****

RVD vs. Jerry Lynn (Living Dangerously) - Oh my god what can I say that hasn't been said yet, this match is freakin' awesome way better than their 2nd match. Jerry Lynn could've been champ *****

RVD vs. Balls Mahoney - This is to only capitalize on the defenses of the television title. This match is still pretty good ****

RVD vs. Jerry Lynn (Guilty as Charged) - A so-so encounter compared to their first match, only good thing is the bumps that both men took, cool finish ***1/2

RVD vs. Jeff Hardy (Invasion) - One of Rob's finer WWE matches but not his greatest, again there were some serious bumps taken by both men ****

RVD vs. Chris Jericho - This is Rob's first ever actual time as being accepted as a member of the WWE roster, Rob would later lose the KOTR tournament to an undeserving Brock ****

RVD vs. Christian (Ladder match for the IC title) - I absolutely love this match, even if it is a little short, some really cool ladder moves and one of RVD's best singlets, I think *****",1113350400,23,2768,4.273946360153257
2193861,4,B0006SSNVY,"The other reviews here have match listings and basic summaries of this DVD, so I'll just skip over that.  If you enjoy Rob Van Dam's matches today or during his ECW stint, definately buy this DVD.  A lot of these matches are very good (vs. Jerry Lynn, vs. Sabu, vs. Jeff Hardy), but there are a few that are nothing special.  The two WCW matches are certainly not cant-miss material, though they are somewhat entertaining.  The extras are also fun if you haven't seen them before, or want to revisit those segments and promos.  The only wrestling fans I wouldn't recommend this DVD to are the ones who don't like hardcore wrestling at all.  This DVD is full of that, especially in the ECW matches.",1112400000,2,697,4.536

But watching this DVD, I was taken aback at how insane the WWE crowd is for Van Dam. And I'm going to love it when his underpromoted DVD (it's nowhere to be found in ANY store in Los Angeles!) outsells that of every other overpushed wrestler in Vince's family circus. What will Van Dam get for his efforts? I'm guessing a year long feud with Rudy Diamond -- where he loses. And we'll get more diet books from Triple HGH. BTW, The Rise and Fall of ECW is going to pass WMXX as the best selling DVD in WWE history. It's these small victories that keeps me from swallowing a gallon of Liquid Plumber . . . . Super Strength.",1108425600,6,724,4.105633802816901
2193865,1,B0006SSNVY,"OK first of all let me say this, I'm a HUGE RVD fan, I love him in the WWE, and in ECW his matches were some of the best in pro wrestling history. However you woudn't know that from this hack-job. First of all they include his matches from WCW when he was nothing more than a jobber imitating moves from jean claude van damme movies. These first two matches were nothing more than pure garbage. Van Dam goes about doing his routine, then lets the other guy do his routine, till van dam hits the split legged mounsault and gets the pin. These matches might have been memorable to RVD but they are hardly his best stuff. When it gets to ECW the WWE managed to pick out some of his worst matches in there. Axl Rotten, Perry Saturn, even the first sabu matches were nothing but crap. good for their day, but today, those matches look like garbage.

Outside of his later matches, aka, vs. Jerry Lynn, as well as vs. Bam Bam Bigelow, and his matches in the WWE this DVD sorely lacks. RVD's commentary mainly goes about discussing the matches that are on the DVD, since those matches pretty much suck as it is, it gives you an idea of what to expect. Van Dam does his career no justice by over romanticizing these crap matches. rather than say what's wrong with them I'll tell you this, there were so many better matches in his career that I'll just give em to you...

RVD V. SABU for the TV title, (1998, and another one who's date I cannot recall) ARGUABLY the best match of RVD's career, as he and SABU fought twice to time-out finishes. Some of the best wrestling ever done this side of the pacific ocean.

RVD & SABU v. Candino & Storm the culmination of one of the best angles ever done in ECW, STorm and Candino were the champs who didn't like each other, van dam and sabu had just put their differences aside to fight these guys in what ended up being a very emotional match.

Sabu & RVD v. DUdleys (Japan) Finished with a van-daminator through a table, need I say more?

RVD v. Tommy Dreamer TV title defense. Tommy Dreamer not only put over RVD big time he was almost perfect for taking the punishment Van Dam had layed out.

RVD v. Bigelow, Bigelow's last match. These two guys found a way to break metal tables, too bad it was taken by the ECW fan cam, ECW's worst idea by far.

RVD & SABU v. Hakushi & ?. The other guys name ecapes me right now, however, I know that these four put on one of the best matches I've ever seen from the tag division, no suprise it ends with RVD & SABU comin out with the win.

RVD, SABU, TAZ v. TRIPLE THREAT. THis match was one that defined the Triple threat, and the triple threat's angle throughout all ECW. Sabu may have come up with the pin yet RVD did his fair share, some might argue this is more of a taz match, but everyone had their moments.

No offense to RVD, but the matches chosen were probably picked as part of Vince's idea to rewrite wrestling history. He wants you to think ECW was all about tables chairs, and spots when in actuality it was about great wrestling. This DVD shows RVD's spots real well, and it works to define him as a ""spot"" oriented wrestler. No doubt as a way to show him under the current champ, and heir to the throne, triple h.",1108425600,5,3203,4.237704918032787
2193866,5,B0006SSNVY,"For those of you that only know Rob Van Dam from 2001 to the present, this is the DVD for you. With this DVD you will finally see why a large quantity of wrestling fans think it is a travesty at how RVD has been underused in the last two years. This DVD has 16 complete matches, 11 matches are from his days in ECW and that is what you need to focus on. The extras are so so, there is a couple of eastereggs with funny RVD interviews from ECW. The matches is worth the price alone. Here is a rundown of some of the greatest matches you will ever see and they are on this DVD.

Robby V vs. Pat Rose: Ok, th is isn't one of the greatest matches and the next match I review won't be either but it shows RVD 12 yrs ago when he was trying to make a name for himself.

Robby V vs. Scotty Flamingo: Like I said before, not a great match but you get to see both RVD and Raven before they got there big breaks in ECW.

Rob Van Dam vs. Axl Rotten: And the legend begins. This is his first match in ECW and he is still trying to find the character he wants to be but he gains the ECW fan's respect in his debut match.

RVD vs. Sabu(2 matches): These guys trained together under The Original Sheik and these are just two of there classic encounters. Both matches are around 20 mins in length and the action never slows down.

RVD and Sabu vs. The Eliminators: For new fans, this may be you only chance to see one of the best and most underrated tag teams of all time, seeing that The Eliminators have been broken up for almost eight years and neither one is in the WWE. The Eliminators were Perry Saturn and John Kronus and they were in my opinion, the best tag team at the time. Before The Dudleys got there huge push in ECW. This is a great hardcore tag team match that includes, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs, among the usual RVD moves.

Rob Van Dam vs. Lance Storm: Decent match, lets you see the story of how RVD became Mr. Monday Night.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy: Total squash. Only reason for this is to continue the storyline of the Mr. Monday Night angle.

Rob Van Dam vs. Tommy Dreamer: This was a flag match in which the winner would get to raise his flag. Tommy Dreamer carried the flag for ECW and RVD carried the flag for WWF, which is now WWE. Some hard hitting action. Only minus in this match is the screwjob ending. Should have been a clean decision. Not giving away the outcome, but a non ref makes the official three count.

Rob Van Dam vs. Bam Bam Bigelow: This is the match in which RVD became the individual that could do no wrong. No matter what he did after this match, he was a fan favorite. The aerial moves he pulls off in this match will astonish you.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn(two matches): Two of the greatest wrestling clinics ever displayed. Not much more I can say. The best match they had is not even one of these two. Thats my opinion of course and that match I am speaking of is on the Rise and Fall of ECW dvd. These two matches on this collection are classics as well and would complement the other match for anybody that has the Rise and Fall DVD. The latest ECW match on this dvd is RVD and Jerry Lynn from ECW's last ppv. It shows RVD use the Van Terminator, which is the best in ring move he has ever done.

Rob Van Dam vs. Balls Mahoney: Very similar to the Bam Bam Bigelow match. RVD doesn't do quite as many daredevil moves as he did in the Bigelow match but he still does a couple that are just amazing.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy: In my opinion, this is his finest match since coming into the WWE. There was so much difference in the four years since his other match with Jeff Hardy, that I couldn't group them in a review like I did the Lynn and Sabu matches. Jeff Hardy had come along way since 1997 and this was 2001. This was for the hardcore championship and in the introduction that RVD gives before this match, he states that he wish WWE would bring back the hardcore title and he thinks the reason they did away with that title is because no one could keep up with his own hardcore style. I can't argue.

Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Jericho: Great scientific display by these men and it took place in 2002, which was the year it appeared WWE was going to give RVD the proper push he deserved.

Rob Van Dam vs. Christian: One of the shorter ladder matches you will see but it was the most brutal in WWE history. This being a ladder match, I am not including the TLC classics. Good display by two men that in my opinion should be future world champions.

The intro into each match by RVD is insightful as well. Any fan of RVD or ECW should by this must have collection.",1108339200,19,4608,4.110122358175751
2193867,5,B0006SSNVY,"THis DVD is amazing, some of the things on this DVD are utterly INSANE. I hadnt seen alot of these matches since i didn't get to see ECW Often, but this was Deffinatly Worth the Money, if your a RVD Fan, or a ECW Fan, or a hardcore Fan YOu really Should get this DVD 5 Stars, Amazing Show!",1107993600,,289,3.9152542372881354
2193868,5,B0006SSNVY,"When RVD came into WWE in 2001, I knew very little about him. We didn't get ECW locally and I never got to see TNN. But after the last 3 years of stellar performance, I wanted to see what RVD was like in his element: ECW. So when I saw RVD's One of A Kind DVD on a local store shelf, I immediately picked it up and bought it.  This DVD is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best Superstar packages ever produced by WWE.
This really shows the evolution of RVD from low-card challenger to the mid-card king to main eventing PPVs when he wasn't even ECW champion. Here are some of my favorite matches on this DVD:
1) RVD vs. Sabu- Amazing. The rope broke and they still put on an extreme classic.
2) RVD vs. Bam Bam Bigalow- I've watched Bam Bam for most of the time I've watched wrestling, and I've never seen him get his butt handed to him in such a dramatic fashion.  Great match.
3)RVD vs. Jerry Lynn- WOW! EXCELLENT 25 min. match.  Too bad Lynn couldn't make it in WWE.
4) RVD vs. Hardy-(Invasion 2001)- This is where that Bon Jovi wannabe gets to know the true Mr. Extreme,(MR.PPV) RVD.
5)RVD vs. Christian- Excellent Ladder Match. Sounds great on DVD compared to live TV.
There are other superb matches on this DVD.  My advice is to get it now!!!!",1107820800,3,1255,4.216666666666667
2193869,5,B0006SSNVY,"The new DVD, ""One of a kind"" is a fantastic look at the WWE's very underrated wrestler nowadays, Rob Van Dam. Back in ECW days, RVd's name was spoken with respect and amazement, as thousands of fans came to see the ""Whole F'ing Show""

This DVd set show us just what that saying means. It includes 16 matches that are each great to watch, no matter what type of wrestling fan you are.

However the one problem I have is that most of these matches are relatively short, only about 10 minutes long for several of them, some of them less than that. But the rest are awsome to watch and should not be overlooked because of the short matches.

Matches:

Robbie V. vs. Scotty Flamingo: Not that great, one of the short matches I was talking about. But even back then RVd still had great moves. 6/10

RVD vs. Axl Rotten: Again, a short match, but RVD shows us his martial arts skills. Good match, but still not spectacular. RVD wins with a split-legged moonsault. 7/10

RVD vs. Sabu: There are actually two matches with him versus Sabu, but this one is in the first disk, and it is great, considering the ring ropes broke about 5 minutes after the match started.
  Highlights include several wild chairshots and Sabu, giving a DDT to Rvd through a table 3 feet off the floor! 9/10 Very innovative.

Sabu and RVD vs. The Eliminators: Great tag team action. The crowd was great and all four men were okay. Sabu and RVD worked great as a team. 7.5/10

RVD vs. Lance Storm: This was the match before ECW's fist ppv. Okay match, and RVD used chairs with great action. Lance storm's chairshots weren't that great though, but it was still entertaining. 8/10

RVD vs, Jeff Hardy: This was the first of the two matches with Jeff Hardy and this was the bad one. Maybe 3 and a half minutes at the most, and the King's commentary before the match was kinda annoying. 4/10

RVD vs. Tommy Dreamer: A flag match means that the winner would wave a flag of the wrestling company they work for. Dreamer was for ECW, and RVD was for the WWF.

Great match with at least 4 referees getting destroyed and a piledriver that makes RVD jump back up three feet in the air! And in this match Dreamer had a hurt foot that was in a brace. Good match. 9/10

RVD vs. Bam Bam Bigelow: Nice match with two insane jumps by RVd into the crowd. B. B. Bigelow even gave an elbow drop onto a table with RVd on top of it. 8/10 I think this is where RVd started his 23 long month reign.

RVd vs. Jerry Lynn: This is another first match with another competitor. Great chain wrestling and a great Van terminator by RVd. 8.5/10

RVd vs. Jeff Hardy: This was the hardcore title match at the 2001  Invasion ppv. The first 12 seconds of the match were enough for me. A ladder and a chair were used in this one. Good match. 9/10

RVd vs. Chris Jericho: nice match, the only good one of the 2002 King of the Ring. The crowd was great and the chain wrestling was great. 8/10

RVd vs. Christian: Awsome ladder match. About 15 minutes long but very brutal with two ladders.

Highlights include Christian giving a unprettier to Rvd off a ladder and RVd giving the five star frog splash to Christian off a ladder. Too many other hard hitting spots to name in this one and RVd wins a great match. 10/10

Extras include lots of commentary from RVd about competitors and  matches themselves, along with talks about his injuries. Plus a look at what would happen if the legendary Superfly Snuka met RVd in the ring.

Lots of more extras that I won't spoil, but you will regret not getting this Dvd if you are a fan of high flying wrestling.",1107475200,,3575,4.334834834834835
2193870,4,B0006SSNVY,"RVD is the reason to watch wrestling today. He is being screwed over by the WWE right now, no world title? He could out wrestle both JBL and Triple H but he doesnt seem to get any respect. This dvd is the same way. Ive watched RVD for the last few years on WWE and the matches from WWE could have been better then what is presented. RVD and Kanes tag team ladder match on RAW a few years back was one of the greatest matches ive ever seen and sadly its omitted. Still happy that he has his own dvd though! Id recommand it!",1107302400,,522,3.980952380952381
2193871,5,B0006SSNVY,"Unlike the best of the intercontinental championship dvd, this is one that delivers.  This dvd contains about 3 hours of matches with wrestlers like Jerry Lynn, Jeff Hardy, Sabu, Bam Bam Bigelow, Y2J, and Scotty Flamingo a.k.a Raven.  RVD talks about his time with all 3 companies WCW, ECW, and WWE and compares the companies.  He talks about his favorite wrestlemania moment, wrestlers talk about who would win b/w RVD and Superfly Jimmy Snuka, comparing his frog splash with Eddie Guerrero's and have that move became one of his signature moves and a breif detail of what RVD's life was like before entering the business.  Any die hard fan of Mr. Monday Night would enjoy this as it contains many memorable matches from ECW.  Recommended.",1107302400,2,740,4.888
2193872,5,B0006SSNVY,This dvd is AWESOME. The matches are classic a few are Amazing.  I recommend this to any wrestling fan.,1107216000,,103,4.421052631578948
2193873,4,B0006SSNVY,"Great DVD, would be 5 stars if WWE had a better match selection.

They should have included one of his matches with Steve Austin.  Also, they could have replaced the Balls Mahoney & Chris Jericho matches.  They were decent, but there is much better RVD matches out there.

RVD v. Tommy Dreamer- ECW N2R 97 *** (watch Van Dam sell a piledriver like a man, 3 feet into the air)

RVD v. Bam Bam Bigelow- Van Dam wins the TV Title **** (Absolutely jaw dropping maneuvers by Van Dam)

RVD v. Jerry Lynn- Living Dangerously ****1/2 (Some of the most innovative chain wrestling and counter wrestling you will ever see)

RVD v. Jerry Lynn- Guilty as Charged 2001  ***1/2 (not their best match, but still much better than I remember it to be)

2193874,5,B0006SSNVY,"This 2-DVD set will be a gem for any true wrestling fan.  Spanning his early WCW days through his current tenure in the WWE, this set features some of RVD's most memorable matches.  The true highlight is getting his best ECW matches with digital quality.

The House Party '96 match vs. Axl Rotten, RVD's ECW debut, is interesting to see because he really hadn't found his character yet.  The matches with Sabu (Hostile City Showdown '96 and Hardcore Heaven '96) are incredible and still hold up as such nine years later.  A bonus from 1997 is getting to see him wrestle on RAW is WAR vs. Jeff Hardy.

Probably the best match on the DVD is his 4/4/98 match in Buffalo against Bam Bam Bigelow.  That night, Van Dam won the ECW Television Title (with a little help from Sabu) and wowed the crowd with dives three rows into the stands.  Just an amazing match.  This match can also be found on the ECW Path of Destruction video, released a few years back.

The set also has some historical matches, too, such as RVD main-eventing the Anarchy Rulz '99 PPV in Chicago against Ballz Mahoney and his match with Jerry Lynn to wrap up ECW's final PPV, Guilty as Charged 2001.

The set also includes such matches as RVD vs. Tommy Dreamer in a flag match from November 2 Remember '97, RVD and Sabu vs. The Eliminators from February '97, RVD vs. Lynn from Living Dangerously '99 (nice touch to not re-release the Hardcore Heaven '99 match again), etc.

Then, adding to the ECW legacy, the set includes three of RVD's best WWF/WWE matches.  First is his inaugural WWF PPV match, when he took on Jeff Hardy at Invasion (7/22/01).  This was a great match that gained him more popularity with fans who hadn't watched ECW.  Also included are a great match with Chris Jericho from King of the Ring 2002 and a ladder match vs. Christian from a September 2003 edition of RAW.
