3033732,5,B000YOX3HE,"This DVD release is just plain awesome, there's no other way to describe it.  For someone like me who doesn't normally the full season sets, this is perfect.  I missed this when it was originally broadcast on FOX, which is to me better being able to watch it unedited, & commercial free.  The jokes are spot on all the way through, if you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love this DVD!!

Aside from the actual show, you also get a DVD packed with extra features.  First off you get a a telling interview with George Lucas conducted by Seth Macfarlane himself.  This isn't your average interview, it really makes George seem a little more human rather than the evil emporor of Lucasfilm LTD.  Next you get a behind the scenes look at the creators working on the show.  The next feature is one of my favorites & a true showing that these guys went above & beyond producing this DVD, you get every ""Family Guy"" scene that's ever refferenced ""Star Wars""; a true bonus feature.  You also get a the added audio commentary track option featuring Seth Macfarlane, + other various directors, producers, writers & editors that worked on ""Blue Harvest"".  And finally on top of all that, you get a bonus disc with a ""portable digital copy of Blue Harvest"" that's compatible with iTunes & Windows media.  Meaning you can put this on your iPod/computer for free.  Very nice package all together making this an absolutely must have item for any Star Wars/Family Guy fan.  Race out & pick this up 1/15/08, you won't be dissapointed!!!",1199404800,8,1513,4.621722846441948
3033733,5,B000YOX3HE,"I recorded this episode on my DVR when it aired in the beginning of this season and I must say it is one of the funniest episodes of Family Guy I've ever seen. This aired as an hour long episode so its shorter than 1 hour when you take out the commercials. I've shown this episode to several non-Family Guy viewers and they've all enjoyed it.

You definitely have to have at least seen the original Star Wars movie to really enjoy this or else you won't get some/most of the jokes. But by this time, if you haven't seen Star Wars yet you must be living in a cave.

I don't know if this DVD is really worth $16 however. It will be available on the DVD box set for this last season (Season 6) when it comes out if you can wait that long. But if you really want to watch it now then I think its cool that they are releasing it. Its also a nice piece to add to your Star Wars collection.",1199404800,37,883,3.983050847457627

It's hard to explain, but this is the BEST family guy episode EVER!! I taped it in october on cartoon network, and it's worth watching as much as the star wars movies themselves!! After watching this episode, I remembered how GREAT the star wars movies were. So,I'm buying the original movies along with this one. THIS DVD IS WORTH BUYING!

3033765,2,B000YOX3HE,"Film Review
As someone who is not the biggest Family Guy fan, Blue Harvest provides a decent source of entertainment.  The references to Star Wars are generally spot on, although it obviously takes some liberties with the more specific plot points.  Most of the jokes work, but a few, like Pizza the Hut, fall flat.  The episode is an hour long special, and to pack a full two hour movie into less than an hour proves tough, with the episode skipping over a few sequences entirely.  The jokes added however, such as the entire couch sequence, are generally well done.

Blu-ray Review
Blue Harvest is in FULL SCREEN.  Why?!  There is no reason that the episode could not be in wide screen, it's not that old of an episode.  To find a blu-ray that's not in wide screen is really disheartening, and it's incredibly disappointing.  The features are rather bare also, with a few comically bad interviews, and that's about it.  What a shame.",1388016000,,935,4.646341463414634

3033775,5,B000YOX3HE,Seth McFarlane is proven again to be the comic genius that he is when he combined Star Wars with Family Guy in an animated spoof of the famous sci-fi movies. Laugh out loud funny with quite good animation(no CGI) is how to describe this DVD. One example:Stewie plays Darth Vader. You get the idea. Outright hilarious!,1365465600,,317,4.678571428571429

3033779,5,B000YOX3HE,The Family Guy series is one of the funniest and crudest animated shows on the television today. I thought that they did a great job making fun of the Star Wars series.,1358121600,,168,4.28125

3033781,5,B000YOX3HE,"Family Guy - Blue Harvest [the parody of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope] is, in my opinion, the best of the Star Wars parodies that has originated from animated series in the past, such as Robot Chicken and Shin Chan.
It follows the basic story line of A New Hope but makes a joke out of everything. As with all Family Guy episodes, generally there's bound to be a few jokes that hit or miss with different people, but definitely if you're a fan of Family Guy you should check this extended episode out. On top of being extended, the animation is superior to the regular episodes
I don't want to spoil too much from this, so I'll just say it's really funny and you should definitely check it out. Had seen it on tv and just now bought it and really enjoy it.
The dvd also comes packed with special features for people who enjoy interviews and whatnot.",1351468800,,854,4.3105590062111805
3033782,5,B000YOX3HE,"Basically before you buy this im assuming you love Family Guy and the Blue Harvest episode that aired.  So here is my review of the DVD since the show is 5 stars.  The special features are much better than anything you get from South Park.  I found this box filled with the usual top notch extras Family Guy is known for.  You get a great full length commentary, an interview with George Lucas that runs about 15mins, the animatic, behind the scenes about the creation, promos, and a sweet reel of all the times Family Guy has made Star Wars during the shows run.  This least feature was unexpected and runs a lot longer than you'd think.  I got a lot of bang for the buck out of this and I hope you will too.",1351209600,,709,4.214814814814815
3033783,5,B000YOX3HE,i have been tryin to find this movie every where to complete my collection im a big star wars fan and these movies are so funny watch them at least once a week product was great not a scratch on the disk!,1351036800,,204,3.880952380952381
3033784,5,B000YOX3HE,"I have never laughed out loud so many times than watching this show except seeing the ""Star Wars"" edition. Being a Gen-X-er and having watched the early Star Wars movies with my younger brother over a dozen times while growing up (like most my age) I found myself anticipating and quoting the original Star Wars dialogue along with the Family Guy characters then rolling into laughable hysterics when they changed something from the original script (like when Stewie waves his hand to suffocate the naysayer underling who scoffs at his lack of real estate knowledge as it pertains to the DeathStar",1339632000,,597,4.920792079207921

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'D BE SOOOOOO FUNNEH XD! Even though I watched Star Wars once when I was like 9, I just can't stop talking about Star Wars because 80's nostalgia is trendy!

Hey guys, remember when Stewie was Darth vader!?!?!?? See that's funny because he's like a small little baby but he's made to be this powerful entity, that's funny because proportions!

If you love Star Wars starring family guy than be sure to check out Seth Mcfarlene's Cavalcade of Cartoon Diarrhea, unfortunately it's not all copmletely centered around Star Wars so NEVERMIND SCREW IT everything sucks now the 80's were the best right guize??

-Blue harvest DVD
-Digital copy disc.
-12 Family guy cards with 3-D image on back of them.
-20pg. artbook.
-Blue and red 3-D glasses.
-Family guy blue harvest XL teashirt. EPIC.
-And last is the dvd case it came in.
All this comes in a DVD case about 5 DVD cases wide! I am extremely satisfied with this product and can't think of any way they could have made a better offer. The Teashirt alone is worth what I paid for it. A Amazing deal for only 13$ + S&H (6$ish). To me the DVD was just a bonus. It worked perfectly as well. Hope this review will help future buyers.

3033789,4,B000YOX3HE,"i thought this was a very funny and clever parody of the first Star Wars film.it's basically the characters from Family guy portraying the characters from the film.there are some inspired choices in which characters portray who.some of the lines are very funny.everything is very fast paced.it stays pretty true to the original film,while adding it's own unique spin.the DVD running time is listed as 48 minutes(it's actually a bit longer than that)so it's obviously condensed.anyway,i laughed a lot.as an aside,i noticed this particular episode seems toned down in term of pushing the envelope,at least compared to other episodes of Family Guy i have seen.maybe it's just my imagination,but,it doesn't seem as sick and twisted or perverse,though there is still some of that element.and yet it's still riotously funny.th version i watched is from Laugh it up Fuzzball:The Family Guy Trilogy collection which contains all three parodies of the first three original Star Wars films.for me Family Guy:Blue Harvest is a 4/5",1301356800,,1019,5.296296296296297

Get them all together if possible.",1300838400,,378,4.04

Or Family Guy parodies of other things.  I guess they just fell short on this for me.  It wasn't bad it just wasn't great for me.",1299196800,,391,4.1466666666666665

3033794,4,B000YOX3HE,"`Blue Harvest' is the excellent `Family Guy' parody of Star Wars: A New Hope and it ticks every box you can imagine. It's extremely funny, well written, short yet sweet and it has Stewie as Dath Vadar, what more could you want? Condensing the whole Star Wars film into about 45-50 minutes, this film still manages to pack in hilarious gags and parodies the original, whilst still being deferential to it's influence on `Family Guy' itself. Seeing Stewie as Vadar, picking holes in the death stars design flaws and Peter as Han Solo, who rings his mum to let her know he's OK after a space battle, are just a few minor touches (out of many) that make this so delightful to watch. It may be short, but this is perfectly formed and if you're fan of `Family Guy' then this will be right up your street and if you've never seen it before then this isn't that bad a place to start either! Great viewing.

In case you are unfamiliar with Blue Harvest: The creators of Family Guy took the entire Star Wars IV - A New Hope, squeezed it down to about an hour, and retold the story using the cast of Family Guy. They perfectly mimic scenes and details from the original movie, then throw in all that extra Family Guy dry humor that we've grown to love so much.

They have since re-done Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as well, but this one is definitely the best of the 3. The whole trilogy is very reasonably priced. I'd recommend going that route for die hard fans. Otherwise, just stick with Blue Harvest. In my opinion it's a true classic.",1295049600,,797,4.2026143790849675

This is a very funny spin on the Episode 4 and people who love Star Wars will appreciate it as will people who enjoy Family Guy.  The casting is great and the way that the Family Guys characters slip so easily into Star Wars is great.

The first thing you notice is the score, it is, well the score for Star Wars, (except when they do the theme to ""The People's Court"".  It demonstrates that music really makes the mood.

Of course the nearly shot for shot sequence, a faithfulness to the story with the normal family guy gags peppered in makes it s must have for Star Wars fans.

The one real weakness is the use of Herbert as Obi-Wan and the resulting Gay Pedophile jokes that follow.

One rather ironic gag is the almost total absence of Meg in the story only showing up as the trash monster.

The whole point of a parody is to celebrate the original film. There is no celebration of Star Wars here- Only a smug, arrogant jackass named Seth spreading his poorly-written lines into a beloved series of movies to promote and affirm his own show and ratings.

Instead of actually poking fun at Star Wars with clever scene twists, unasked questions, or any of the like, Seth and his team bank on the childish humor of distracting from the plot-line, replacing Star Wars characters with Family Guy characters (Meg as the garbage chute monster, Stewie as Darth Vader, Herbert the pervert as Obi-Wan, etc.), and of course, the pointless, overused Family Guy lines that any viewer is far more than familiar with.

3033816,5,B000YOX3HE,"The main motive of the success that is 'Family Guy' is to rip upon all that is pop culture politics and everything in between. But, give creator Seth McFarlane a chance to make fun of Star Wars... and you get a true comical masterpiece.

We begin by understanding what exactly is the concept of parody. A parody is taking an original piece of work and mocking it by adding crude comedy, slapstick and the possible musical number. Mel Brooks did it well, Trey Parker and Matt Stone did it well and let's not forget David Zucker's classic 'Airplane!' But, when it comes to the holy of holys' The creators of Family Guy did something much more.
'Family Guy: Blue Harvest' is actually the first Star Wars film shrunk into 45 minutes with of course the usual Family Guy humor. There are no made up characters, just the cast members of 'Family Guy' playing the 'Star Wars' characters. There are actual lines from the orginal movie used and then given a spin. There are also comedic lines that play upon the 'Star Wars' lore to please the true fans To put it in lamenst terms this is pretty much if George Lucas intended on 'Star Wars' to be a space comedy and not a dramtic fantasy space opera. You still have the traditional 'Family Guy' brand comedy, meaning make sure you have either seen a lot of movies, watched a ton of TV and played bored/video games in your years. The other thing I love is the characters still have the same personalities they bring on the actual show in this special. The perfect example would be Quagmire and Cleavland playing C-3PO and R2-D2.

This was one of the best 'Family Guy' episodes I had ever seen since the show first aird after the 1999 Super Bowl. I am also glad that this specific episode was not included in one of the series volumes. Like 'Stewie Griffen: The Untold Story' 'Blue Harvest' is in fact a separate entity on it's own and to be placed along side the series. Sure you have to shell out some extra cash, but believe me, this is so worth it. I mean even the DVD box and DVD main menu are an exact replica of the origional! I am very excited to know that the crew of 'Family Guy' will in fact be making two more specials spoofing the next two 'Star Wars' films. I am happy to know that they will also be sold on their own and still keeping to the new tradition that has been put in place thanks to 'Blue Harvest.' I sure hope that there will be a prequel trilogy as well. So 'Star Wars' and 'Family Guy' fans alike enjoy this very sepcial gift and begin a new tradition as I have. Watch the original film and cap it off with 'Family Guy'!",1250899200,,2584,4.336776859504132

Being a Gen-X-er and having watched the early Star Wars movies with my younger brother over a dozen times while growing up (like most my age) I found myself anticipating and quoting the original Star Wars dialogue along with the Family Guy characters then rolling into laughable hysterics when they changed something from the original script (like when Stewie waves his hand to suffocate the naysayer underling who scoffs at his lack of real estate knowledge as it pertains to the DeathStar - TOO CUTE)!

Of course, there are some really twisted moments that younger viewers shouldn't be allowed to watch (i.e. the old man who plays Ben Kenobi - while super funny, his character is distasteful - lol.  C3PO/Quagmire's character is a bit rough too).  Overall, though, this episode is fantastic and will keep you in stitches from beginning to end.

The cards and shirt are cool, but the 3D scene is a waste. The quality is poor, and not worth bothering with, which is why I rate it 4 stars not 5.

One thing about both DVDs is that both the creators are called Seth, and if they could have kept the humor clean my young sons who are big Star Wars fans would have been able to watch it. I guess some writers think dirty is funny...

*Very hilarious parodies of ""Star Wars"" and other stuff (also expect parodies of ""Vacation,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Breakfast Club,"" and others).  For ""Star Wars"" in particular, the show emulates most of the movie almost exactly, before breaking into the humor.
*Some very good original jokes too.
*Some funny inside jokes.
*Very good animation quality.

The Bad Things
*Ummmmm....

The Questionable Things
*Some bad language and crude humor.  Not reccomended for most kids or families.
*Not sure why this is called ""Blue Harvest."" Is it because Luke likes blue milk, or what?

I'm not really a ""Family Guy"" fan, but I still enjoyed this.  It's a good, funny, short feature that made me laugh pretty good.  Highly reccomended for anybody who enjoys trashing ""Star Wars.""

This is one Family Guy disc that you can watch over & over again close together & still laugh at the time stuff that doesn't get old.  The only thing that I thought sucked was that the only part they had for Meg was a 2 second cameo.  The DVD extras weren't much past the alternative commentary & a clip show of all the Star Wars references they've done throughout the run of the series but the other extras were an interview with George Lucas, a ""making of"" feature, and the animatic version.

Here is the scrolling writing that Star Wars is famous for but with a Family Guy twist on it all.

A long time ago, but somehow in the future.

Episode IV

It is a time of civil war,
and renegade paragraphs
floating through space.

There's cool space battles,
and the bad guy is the
good guy's dad, but you
don't find that out 'til the
next episode.

And the hot chick is really
the sister of the good
guy, but they don't know it,
and they kiss. which is
kind of messed up. I mean,
what if they had done it
instead of just kissed?

Angelina Jolie kissed her
brother. Yeah, she did. You
know it, I know it and
her Dad knows it. That's
why they hardly ever talk
anymore. You can run away to
Africa, but you can't run
away from the truth.

Oh, by the way, here's
a tip for you: when this
is over, go out and rent
the movie ""Gia."" She's way
naked in it, and makes out
with another chick and
everything. It's awesome.
I stumbled across it late
at night on HBO after I
had just got back from
hockey, and I almost
fainted. But I digest...

Princess Leia was coming
back from buying space
groceries when this
happened...

When reading that at the start of this, I just knew that the episode would be amazing. Chris as Luke, Lois as Leia, Stewie as Darth Vader, Peter as Han, Brian as Chewbacca and Hebert as Obie Wan Kenobie. Other Family Guy characters obviously take other roles from the Star Wars universe and they all blend together in a brilliant movie/feature length episode.

Buy it. I promise you won't be disappointed.",1214697600,,1862,4.2492917847025495
3033841,5,B000YOX3HE,"I grew up in the 70's, so of course like all boys at that time, I loved KISS and Star Wars. Now I'm in my mid 30's and love Family Guy. You have to be my age to 'get' a lot of the Family Guy humor. When I saw that Family Guy did a Star Wars special, I didn't even read the back of the package or look at the price. I just grabbed it and went to the register.

The Blue Harvest is very faithful to the original Episode IV of Star Wars. The characters are 'in character' with their Star Wars counterparts. For instance, who else but Stewie could play Darth Vader? Well maybe Joe if you went by the 'part man part machine' angle, but c'mon who is as evil as Stewie and wants to kill Leia, who of course is played by Lois. My daughter was a little disappointed that Meg (her favorite character) was a two second cameo, but other than that we all laughed until we were Blue Harvested in the face.

Brian is brilliant as Chewbacca, I wonder if maybe Meg could have played Leia since Cris played Luke as they are brother and sister, but then where would you fit Lois? And if you did that then Peter would have to be Darth Vader as he is the father of Luke and Leia. Now granted Peter could have done some hilarious things as Darth Vader, but I think Seth and the gang hashed all this out and I think their final product was very very funny, and that's all that matters isn't it?

I for one enjoyed the old pediphile as Obi-Wan. When the limp light-saber went erect I thought it was a great gag, but his musical number could have been left out. That may be the only scene I would have questioned keeping in. It wasn't offensive, it just slowed the story down a bit and we probably could have done without it since it isn't that memorable.

But all in all this is a MUST HAVE for any and all Family Guy fans and maybe Star Wars fans as well.",1214265600,,1832,4.066481994459834

There are many small scenes that are  almost perfect recreations of actual scenes from the movie. Had they not been slow, boring backrounds without talking that didn't add to the plot that would have been fine. Add a few of these and it might get on your nerves. Good effort, but Ive seen it, I know it, I don't need to see it again.

The second problem with this is the jokes. Just like the Stewie Movie, the good jokes are scarce. There is one running gag throughout involving Peter and a great Meg appearance that got me going, but other then that there aren't many good lines for any of the other characters. That and a song that I could have done without.

I had to buy this because ""it's so good, it just has to be fattening.' I love every minute of this movie. From the scene in the cantina with the leader of the band pretending to be an audience member saying ""play that same song"" to the death star guys complaining about wanting a railing but the higher ups were afraid ""we'd be leaning.""

3033851,5,B000YOX3HE,"While it may seem not worth it to purchase a feature that only goes for 48 minutes the DVD comes with a heap of features that take as long to watch as the film. You get a full length commentary by Seth McFarlane and other important people involved in the show, an interview between Seth and George Lucas which is a bit of an insight into George's life and answers many rumours Star Wars fans have put out there about the making of the original films. An animatic version of the entire film (I don't really see much point to this myself but its there). The clips from the regular season episodes of Family Guy where they made fun of, or parodied a Star Wars movie scene. An introduction to Family Guy, which is a clip show telling the viewer who has never watched a regular episode about each family member and a few scenes of them in action. A documentary on the making of Blue Harvest where the veiwer learns the significance of the name, that they're also doing Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as well and you also get to see Blue Harvest being made. There's also a normal Family Guy episode as well.

I was really impressed by the Blue Harvest. I'm no passionate fan who knows every sentence ever written of either Family Guy or Star Wars but I have enjoyed watching both. I thought Blue Harvest was really well done even from the opening rolling text gags like we later find out Leia and Luke are brother and sister and he kissed her once in this episode, imagine if they had done more, to Peter (whose telling the tale) getting sidetracked and going on about a movie where he saw Angelina Jolie naked and where she was making out with a woman. The movie itself is also full of gags including spot appearances by non Star Wars movie characters such as the Griswalds from National Lampoon's Vacation. I thought the ""what are we getting charged per laser now?"" line when they decide not to fire on an empty of life forms lifepod, as well as ""well you can just sit here and rot then you stuck up @#!*"" when Leia (Lois) pays out her rescuer with ""aren't you a little fat for a stormtrooper"" were two of the funniest parody scenes I've ever seen.

Unfortunately I think the ""blessing"" from George Lucas to make this movie, actually became a ""curse"".  Since Seth McFarlane and crew could do whatever they wanted, they didn't have to be creative in their parody, they could just animate scenes from the movie, which is all they did!

The only laughs I got were when Chris/Luke Skywalker responds to Lois/Leia's snotty remark with, ""Then stay here and rot, b***"", the two Death Star Technicians talking on the bridge before beng killed and Adam West talking about how they stole his couch.

The real point of interest on the DVD is the interview with George Lucas where the questions real fans want answered are asked.

Blue Harvest is another foray into well explored Family Guy territory, nothing new here. The same jokes are recycled over again, but this time set in the immensly  popular Star Wars world, which adds an interesting spin and will make fans and geek boys alike smile with nerdish glee.

Blue Harvest will entertain most people, but will you laugh out loud like you used to? Depends on what you think of the latest season of Family Guy, if you starting to get a little over Family Guy, then don't expect this DVD to be redeeming. If you are still in love with the whole idea of Family Guy, then you will probably love this presentation.

The specials included in this set are all above expectations and will keep fans happy indeed, heaps of bonuses and interesting features, but seriously, what a load of bollocks!!!

Yes, $[...] is a lot for one episode, but there are some nifty bonuses on the disc. There is a behind-the-scenes, a commentary, an interview between Seth McFarlene and George Lucas, and a special extra: you can watch the cast read-through of Family Guy's next Star Wars spoof (the slated title is ""Something Something Something Dark Side"").

Also, it comes with an extra disc for your computer so that you may download it for free and put it on your iPod/PSP.

I have seen it said here that it makes no sense to sell this separately. It does, however, if you want a fun gift for a Star Wars fan, or a little gift for a Family Guy fan. Or, if you're like me, if you missed it when it aired and don't want to wait for the next season to come out on DVD.

As far as the quality of the episode is concerned, I thought this was hilarious. John Bender (Breakfast Club) makes an appearance, for example. Basically, this won't be funny if you don't go in with some knowledge of basic Pop Culture. If you only know things about Star Wars and Sci-Fi, it won't be AS funny (but it will still be hilarious).

3033893,2,B000YOX3HE,"Out of all the things Family Guy has put on DVD this has got to be the bottom of all bottom. Why you ask?Well because this DVD only has one single episode on it,that's enough to make any DVD stink. In an age where we can get full seasons of nearly every show why should someone even bother to buy this. I mean even the old VHS tapes had more episodes on them! First they release half seasons set with season 4 and then season five is missing 5 episodes on the season set,now this i don't think any fan or casual for what matters would really approve this it would be supporting Fox in doing this. Fox is really trying to take advantage of the Family Guy fans,what do they think we are stupid?They only took advantage of the Star Wars theme and that's it,there's ""Blue Harvest"".The stupid thing is that the Blue Harvest episode will enventually be released on the season 6 DVD whitin a year probably,so if you think this really is worth it at 15$ for one episode,you must be nuts.

Unless you agree with Fox's politics of ripping off fans,you should be as angry as i am towards this release. This is probably the worst Fox release ever,most could pass but not this one. The problem ain't the episode,in fact ""Blue Harvest"" is a very good Family Guy episode and its fun to see the characters as Star Wars characters(Stewie is Darth Vader,Chris is Luke,Lois is Lea,Peter is Han Solo,Brian is Chewbacca,i liked Quagmire as C-3PO and Meg has a small role,that is kind of funny)but with that big Family Guy touch in it! Being a fan of both i really enjoyed this episode when it aired in late 2007,the references were really funny(Dr. Who,Dirty Dancing and more!)but this single episode DVD release is what i am angry against. The episode would probaby get a rating somewhere along the four-five stars but this DVD,i am sorry is not even worth one star. Unless you absolutely have to see this episode again and can't wait for season 6th to be released,feel the need to spend 15$ in an awfull way or you are a obsessive Family Guy fan that needs everything on the subject,then this isn't for you. Don't tell i didn't warn you!

Its not that i am a critic that has a taste for giving low ratings,i don't generally give one stars reviews as those are pretty rare from me but when i have to i do. This is one of those cases where i give a one star review and i do feel my rating is appropriate for the item. Actually this a double episode as it was on televison,meaning that there are in fact two episodes on this disc,we are lucky Fox put both on it! The good thing is that they don't FORCE you to buy it bt still it is an awfull product,understand me. If you have an Ipod video there is a digital copy of the episode to put on it,wich is nice but what if you don't have that?Its no utility for them,but for those who do,its great that is a nice feature. The bonus features you get on this are cool and it is stuffed with tons of bonus features,that would have been nice to see on the season 6 set,but because they released it at this time,there is possibility it might not be on the season set,but that would surprise me.

The episode might have deserved a special release but they could have done a little more adding a few episodes or something,i mean the episode and all the features are great but...It is also to note that this episode is basicly episode IV of Star Wars a la Family Guy meaning there might and will probably be more of those Family Guy/Star Wars episodes in the future. The cover of the DVD is very similiar to the cover of Episode IV,actually its pretty much the same with the Family Guy's characters as Star Wars's. If you really want this episode however i think you might like the special edition more as it has even more stuff on it and with the shirt and all you get its probably worth it a little more. It is close to ten bucks more tought,25$ at the time of reviewing wich makes it close to the price of a season set. You must ask yourself how much you really wanyt and need this and wich edition to get,i won't get it but you can.",1204070400,3,4051,4.29281045751634

There's no reason why they should be splitting seasons in half and charging the same price, let alone glorifying this one ""slightly longer"" episode like its the best thing ever in an attempt to make more money.

This episode should be included with the rest of the season episodes - I don't recommend buying it unless you're a true collector, and I REALLY don't recommend buying it for someone you know who's a Family Guy fan unless they already own the other DVD's.",1203811200,13,1315,4.363265306122449

I'm from the UK and I was disappointed with the UK special edition of Blue Harvest due to the lack of an additional digital copy which I wanted for my iPod.

While the regular show occasionally throws in a Star Wars reference for laffs, Blue Harvest is a faithful recreation of Episode IV: A New Hope. I know a lot of younger fans for whom Star Wars isn't an obsession. While the Jawa noise, or Han Solo REALLY shooting first, elicited peals of laughter from my 37-year old sister, my 24-year old work colleague sat straight-faced and couldn't understand why I was so delighted -- and he's a bigger Family Guy fan that I am! He's much more familiar with Anakin's story from the new trilogy, so the conversation between the two Stormtroopers regarding a drill means very little to him.

Overall I found it to be an excellent Star Wars homage, but only a mildly amusing Family Guy episode.",1203206400,,868,4.62987012987013

However, it is really just another episode (or double episode) of the TV series, rather than a stand-alone film.

The price I paid for it, AUD$29, was, in hindsight, obscene for what I got, and I would hazard to say that this film should have simply been included in any boxset from the season it was part of.

3033937,4,B000YOX3HE,"The highly popular TV show Family Guy has become a source of pop culture amongst fans that have supported it even after it was originally canceled. The surge of interest when the show appeared on DVD eventually got the series to be reinstated, and now the beloved dysfunctional family is back for their second feature length special. Series creator Seth McFarlane has long been a considerable fan of Star Wars, and so for Family Guy Presents: Blue Harvest, the hilarious characters all take over familiar roles as the heroes and villains of the galaxy far, far away.

The story of a young farmer who dreams of battling the evil galactic empire up in the far reaches of space, needs no explaining. Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, the faithful droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 and the ruthless Darth Vader all make an appearance - as highly stylized transformations into Family Guy personalities. The constantly calculating Stewie portrays the Dark Lord of the Sith, simple-minded Chris plays Luke, ""Family Guy"" Peter Griffin is an overweight Han Solo, Brian is a short Chewbacca, Lois is Leia, and Cleveland and Quagmire are R2-D2 and C-3P0 respectively. Other delightfully witty appearances are made by Herbert the pedophile, as Obi-Wan, Mayor Adam West as Grand Moff Tarkin (voiced by none other than Adam West), and even Meg (the constant butt of jokes) as the Dianoga trash compactor serpent.

While much of the film looks to have been rotascoped and cartoon shaded to perfectly match the movements of the original movie elements, such as Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters (with Thai pilots) and the fast-maneuvering Millennium Falcon, Blue Harvest is not without its unique moments of bizarre deviations from the original story. A flamboyant dance sequence with Ben Kenobi was somehow expected and yet so drastically different from anything you'd normally find in a Star Wars parody, and the need for Han Solo to snag a well-worn couch from the trash compacter during their escape, sees the heroic team attempting feats far less relevant to aiding the Rebellion.

But of course the best part of any Family Guy outing is the constant stabs at politics, people, places, religion, other shows and any idea that can be stretched to pluck a laugh from. Parodying not only the famous moments from Star Wars (A New Hope as well as the other episodes), Blue Harvest proceeds to jest at the expense of Angelina Jolie, golf, Christianity, American Dad, elevator music, Magic Johnson, Big Red chewing gum, Robot Chicken, and Chevy Chase to name but a few. The TV show is built on references to such a vast array of pop culture that some jokes you get and others you don't, but they keep coming in a fast pace, so there's no time to dwell on bits that are just out of reach of your subconscious.

Family Guy Presents: Blue Harvest is a perfect delight for fans of the TV show, and doubles as a main attraction for anyone who has grown up with the influences of Star Wars. Familiar Family Guy faces appear at every turn, but the jokes are often even droller if you've kept up with the regular series. By no means a perfect spoof, Blue Harvest is a must-own for fans of Family Guy, a show that has been stretching the boundaries of cartoon decency for a very long time and now within a George Lucas approved galaxy far, far away.

3033959,5,B000YOX3HE,"One of the best episodes of my absolute favorite show EVER! Although many people seem to thumb their noses at Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy there are many more like myself who appreciate and enjoy the style of humor presented in this show and American Dad. The writing talent of all involved showcases a true understanding of human nature and the way they hold a mirror to us and allow us to see how we as a people behave at times is priceless. Anyone that dislikes Family Guy and the situations and cutaway topics generally do not like the way many people behave as a whole and perhaps see something within themselves that they do not care for. I on the other hand embrace my quirks and the imperfect personality traits of others.

This episode, for those who don't know, is the retelling of ""Star Wars Episode 4 - A New Hope"" using a large assortment of classic Family Guy characters in place of the original characters created by George Lucas. The title ""Blue Harvest"" was chosen as that was the working title used to keep a low profile during the filming of ""Return Of The Jedi"" and everyone felt that would be a real nice tip of the hat to the true fans. Of course, as most episodes released on DVD for this show, there are extra and extended scenes making this uncensored version even more entertaining.

There is also a plethora of bonus features including a discussion between MacFarlane and Lucas that shows how positive Lucas' reaction was to the creation of this episode and how his children are HUGE Family Guy fans, a complete animatic of the episode showing some different bits and scenes not produced for the final episode, and an informative and entertaining audio commentary where Seth names his favorite karaoke hideout. The limited edition box set also contains a unique T-shirt, a booklet showcasing some of the original artwork created during the production of the episode, 3-D glasses to use while watching the 3-D fight scene and a set of trading cards made to look like the original Star Wars trading cards from the late 70's.

A fantastic set and worth every penny. There is a comment made that the Family Guy staff plans to release Empire and Jedi as well, so I hope the networks finally give the writers their due and this writers strike ends soon so we can get the next season of Family Guy underway. Seth, you ROCK, man!

3033965,3,B000YOX3HE,"I'll keep this as brief as possible.  Family Guy: Blue Harvest will be a major dissapointment to all but die hard Family Guy and Star Wars fans, of which I am both.  But even with that said, I was still not very happy about this.  Excluding the first season, I would say that this episode (and let's not kid ourselves here, it's not a movie, it's an episode) ranks in the least funny.  With so many chances for good gags, I was constantly surprised at the lame jokes that the writers chose to make.  I would say that the funniest bits were during the intro and outro segments with the family sitting on the couch.  It's true that the animation here is top-notch, and they did an incredible job of matching scenes from the original film but, frankly, if I want to see those scenes played out with that kind of detail, I'll just watch the original, thanks.  All that being said, if you are a compulsive collector of DVDs as I am, this is the only way you will own this episode (those that say they are waiting for this episode to be released with the regular season set are kidding themselves).

Regarding the Digital Copy included with the DVD version; completely useless.  It can only be used a single time, and if you don't make use of it within 12 months of the episode's release, your right to use it basically becomes invalid.  Plus, according to the reading I did from the disc's faq, it's non-transferable, so once you have it on your computer (or ipod or whatever) it can't be copied over or re-installed if you get a new system (I may not be 100% on all of this, but this is how it works as best as I could figure it...reading terms of use agreements makes my eyes cross).  With these kinds of limitations, why include a digital copy at all?  Better to have skipped it and lowered the overall price of this DVD.",1201478400,12,1819,4.349112426035503

most of it was just a synopsis of Episode IV with different actors and throw in the requisite amount of profanity and toilet humor. There were precious few truly clever scenes and most of them were in the trailer clips. (I did think the scene of the guy sitting in front of his trailer with a light-saber being used as a bug-zapper was quite original, though.  And, as an older viewer, I appreciate the ""Airplane!"" reference.) And as a Christian I was much more offended by the Storm-trooper Church sequence than the suggestion that ""the Force"" is perceived as mostly gnostic anti-Christian.

Like any other episode of Family Guy, there are plenty of visual gags, in-jokes, ramblings, and pop culture stabs combined with the Star Wars mythology, with the only complaint really being that Family Guy: Blue Harvest is too short.

3033987,4,B000YOX3HE,"I was a little surprised at how short the show was (about 45min). At first I thought it was a little more than hour especially since the Star Wars movies topped 2 hours in length. I was amazed at how Seth McFarlane (the creator of Family Guy) was able to condense the rendition of Star Wars into a Family Guy episode.
 As usual Family Guy had its brand of raunchy (just the way I like it) humor. While it was spread out, the laughs were loud and almost brought you to tears (deep laughs). Usually when I'm watching Family Guy, the laughs are all over the place and almost at every second. In Blue Harvest, they were more spread out.
 If you love the Star Wars saga you are going to like Blue Harvest. It's Family Guy's interpretation of Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. The special edition Blue Harvest DVD package is loaded with a lot of goodies not seen in other special editions. Other special editions usually mean deleted scenes, interviews with only one or two stars of the movie as well as the director. This special edition package gives you an XL t-shirt of the picture on the box (very nice), trading cards, 3-D glasses for a small segement of the show when Peter/Han Solo and Chris/Luke Skywalker are in the falcon shooting the Tie-fighters, 2 dvd;s (one is the movie the other is a disc that allows you to download the show onto your computer or ipod, and some reading material (storyboards and concept art). The DVD is also packed with interviews with a noticably uneasy George Lucas the creator and billionare of anything Star Wars. He needs to grow up, its not like he only has a penny in his pocket. Even though Family Guy goes one step further than The Simpsons, Im sure Seth McFarlane gave him a little extra for his overflowing purse. Or is he still seething over the media crying that Revenge of the Sith was too violent. I remember when George Lucas shot back by saying,"" Hey, it's a civil war, not a stroll in the park!""
If you like Family Guy you will love the special edition package and its contents. If you're not the type to get special edition DVD's you will enjoy this one. It's only an extra $10 than most regular DVD's. If the shirt that is included in the special edition DVD was available in stores, you would be paying at least $8-$10. So add this with the $10-$12 regular DVD package and all you get is the DVD and the shirt. Not bad for $24 for the Blue Harvest Special Edition and ALL of its goodies.
 I was a little disapointed with the length of the ""spoof"" of Star Wars and how the laughs were spread out longer than they would of been in a regular 30min episode of Family Guy. I'm sure if the movie was longer, there would be more laughs. Finally, I feel bad for Meg (the daughter). See the show and you'll se why.",1200873600,,2755,4.345631067961165
3033988,5,B000YOX3HE,"I am a huge fan of STAR WARS, but I'm not a huge fan of FAMILY GUY. However, I do watch the show occasionally from time to time and I noticed that the show makes quite a few references to STAR WARS. When I had heard that FAMILY GUY was going to be spoofing STAR WARS for its 2007-08 season premiere, I made sure to watch. It was one of the best spoofings of STAR WARS I have seen on television and one of the few FAMILY GUY episodes that would be okay for families to watch together.

That episode, ""Blue Harvest"", has now been released in a special extended edition on DVD. The episode is about forty-five minutes and follows the plot of STAR WARS fairly closely with plenty of FAMILY GUY humor thrown in. Chris plays Luke, Lois plays Leia, Peter plays Han Solo, Brian plays Chewbacca, Stewie plays Darth Vader, and Meg makes a brief appearance as the monster in the garbage pit of the Death Star. Guest voices include a wide range from Rush Limbaugh to Helen Redding.

True to FAMILY GUY style, there are some jokes and language on this DVD episode, though not too much, that didn't air when the show was first broadcast. Extras on the DVD include a commentary with Seth MacFarlane, director Dominic Polcino, and other writers, producers, editors, and artists; a conversation between Seth MacFarlane and George Lucas; a making of featurette entitled ""Once in a Lifetime: The Making of Blue Harvest""; the animatic version of the episode; a FAMILY GUY Star Wars clip show featuring references to the movies used in the show; and a trailer for FAMILY GUY. I found the conversation between MacFarlane and Lucas to be most enjoyable of the extras because Lucas doesn't grant many interviews like that and because MacFarlane asked him a lot of questions that would not be asked otherwise. The ""Once in a Lifetime"" featurette was also enjoyable as it allowed many people who were behind the scenes to share their love of STAR WARS and tell their story of being involved with this particular FAMILY GUY episode. The animatic version of the episode will probably only interest those who have a serious interest in film or art--this is the version of the film used as a test for the studios before it was shipped overseas for coloring and perfecting.

Recommended for fans of STAR WARS. FAMILY GUY fans might also be interested, but this episode will be a part of the 6th Season DVD set so you might want to just wait until then. I also recommend this episode as an introduction episode to show people who have never seen FAMILY GUY but enjoy the type of humor on the show and would probably enjoy watching the series.",1200787200,,2610,4.572649572649572
3033989,5,B000YOX3HE,"Family Guy's homage to Star Wars is hilarious. The FG character's slip easily into their SW personas while still keeping their original personalities. Stewie is a natural choice as Darth Vader. Some of the others, like Chris as Luke and Peter as Han Solo, seem odd at first, but the writers do such a good job you buy into it. The whole episode has a deep, rich look to it. They follow the story with exactness using the original dialog whenever possible. They've copied every detail to pull you into the Star Wars universe.

Some of the jokes are pure Family Guy, like when Luke is staring out at the twin suns of Tatooine and the music swells, Chris/Luke turns and says ""John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra everybody"" and there they are playing the score. The Chris/Luke has them play the theme to the People's Court. Other jokes are based on observations I never would have made. On board the Millenium Falcon, when Luke/Chris says to Peter/Han ""You don't believe in the force, do you?"", Han/Peter replies, ""You mean that thing you just found out about 3 hours ago and are now judging me on?""

Blue Harvest is a very funny, very well made episode and I'm glad to hear they are going to do the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.",1200787200,5,1251,4.530973451327434
3033990,5,B000YOX3HE,"Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and agree with everyone in saying that it's ridiculous to charge people $25 for 1 episode of a tv series. However, it does come with other stuff. The episode itself is hilarious, and is just a really well done parady of A New Hope. The shirt that comes with it also looks pretty good. It is a rip off, but the product is still top notch.",1200700800,2,362,4.112676056338028

Oh, but this is HIGH-BROW, because they called it 'Blue Harvest', the secret filming name of ROTJ.  Aren't these people clever?  Or maybe just pretentious.
The jokes in this are stale, and have been done over and over already.  The only legitimate laugh was John Williams accidentally being killed and replaced with a dull and repetitive Danny Elfman.  Hey, waitaminute... maybe that's the irony of this:
Danny Elfman = dull and repetitive composer
Family Guy = dull and repetitive Simpsons ripoff in a tired Star Wars parody.",1200700800,10,763,5.056
3033992,5,B000YOX3HE,"I first saw this on Fox in Fall 2007, and instantly loved it! It's got all the classic witty humor of Family Guy with a Star Wars twist.
One of the best things about Seth Macfarlane's parodies is that they're always accurate. Macfarlane does his home work before he makes a parody, so they're always accurate, always funny, and always hit their mark!

The story pretty much starts off with Peter telling everyone his take on Star Wars after a power outage to entertain his family. From there it's all a hilarious parody of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

The DVD itself is great too, has plenty of special features to watch if you're into that sort of thing, and it even comes with a 2nd disk to download a free digital copy of Blue Harvest to your Computer & ipod!

In short, this DVD is pure comic gold. If you like Family Guy and Star Wars Parodies like ""Space Balls"" then you won't be disappointed by Blue Harvest.
Don't be fooled by other reviews that give this DVD 1 star, they're mostly Star Wars nerds who don't like anything that parodies their perfect movie. Well, shame on them... I myself am a fan of Star Wars, and I find Blue Harvest to be hilarious and the jokes very accurate to Star Wars. I even hope that Seth will make parodies of Star Wars Episodes V & VI (The Empires Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi) as well. In the end, it all depends on if you like Family Guy or not.",1200700800,2,1396,4.260377358490566

I bought it because I figured those bad reviews weren't from Family Guy/Star Wars fans, and I loved the movie!  After being a lifelong Star Wars fan, it was cool to see a cartoon copy it out of respect and add the 21st century humor.  If you respect Star Wars and love Family Guy, you'll love this, period.",1200700800,,433,4.192771084337349
3033994,5,B000YOX3HE,"Fans of the television hit animated show FAMILY GUY are die hard fans. They love each and every thing there is to know about the Griffin family. We all have our favorites (but face it, nearly everyone loves infant Stewie). But the Griffin family can not be contained on this planet as is seen in this week's release, FAMILY GUY PRESENTS BLUE HARVEST.

The title is a reference to the filming title of George Lucas' hit ""Return of the Jedi"", one of those lesser known facts that fanatics of the STAR WARS films know by heart. Yes, the fanatics of one show meet with those of another as the Family Guy group takes on Star Wars. This isn't much of a leap if you watch the show as references to the sci fi film series have popped up throughout its run (and are collected here on the DVD in the special features area).

The Griffin family is sitting at home one night watching TV when the power goes out. To pass the time, Peter decides to tell them all the story of Star Wars, albeit his version, not the correct one. Each of the family members as well as supporting cast members takes on a different role. For instance young Chris is Luke, Peter Han Solo, Lois is Leia and so on. Funniest by far is young Stewie who appears decked out as Darth Vader, even though he stands no more than 18 inches high.

The film follows the main plot of the original STAR WARS film, the first one that came out not the first one in order. Everything from the Jawas to the sand people to the death star is here. One interesting scene that begs for the pause button is the cantina sequence. See how many characters from other series of films you note in the bar.

The usual off the wall humor of the series is here in spades. Everything from references to things that could have been different (a FAMILY GUY staple) to Han/Peter attempting to load a sofa into the Millennium Falcon.

The DVD also features some hilarious voice cameos, in particular Rush Limbaugh as Rush in the future. His rant about Lando Calrissian taking command of the cloud city due to affirmative action is hilarious.

Special Features on this disc include a rare interview with George Lucas conducted by FAMILY GUY creator Seth McFarlane. The fan boy comes out in Seth as he speaks to his idol. And Lucas shows a fan side of his own for the FAMILY GUY series. Also included are exclusive DVD material, a teaser for the next STAR WARS spoof and more.

For the truly fanatical you can find a special edition of this disc that includes such items as trading cards, a brochure, T-shirt, 3-D fight scene and more.

While animated, this DVD is not necessarily one to recommend to smaller children. But teens and adults will both find something to laugh at here. Let's hope that the do indeed make a sequel. With the number of STAR WARS films out there it only seems fitting.",1200700800,2,2820,4.420038535645472
3033995,4,B000YOX3HE,"I saw this on TV, and when the DVD came out with the commentary material, I decided to get it (had a left over gift card from December that I had to blow).

A lot of the 1-star reviews are based purely on price, and I think that's unfortunate.  $13.00 - $16.00 isn't cheap for 48 minutes of animation, but it's not a ripoff either.  The DVD is one episode, but it is also double the length of a regular 24 minute episode.  Fans of anime have been paying worse prices for years:)

Why not five stars?  Because this isn't an epic must-buy in my book.  It is a slightly over-priced guilty indulgence that is worth taking if you like smart spoofs and Star Wars.",1200614400,,657,4.208
3033996,3,B000YOX3HE,"For the record, this 2 episode series is really funny. As a family guy fan and a star wars fan, I found this to be way better, honestly, than I anticipated. However, is it worth $12? Well it certainly isn't worth any more than that. After all, it is only 42 minutes altogether! But the amazon sales price right now is exceptional; over at Wal Mart the same thing is going for $20. It really just depends on how badly you want to see this and if you really think you will be watching it more than once.",1200614400,,501,4.122448979591836

OUTSTANDING.",1200614400,2,330,4.171875
3033998,5,B000YOX3HE,"This parody is perfect. Everything fans of Family Guy & Star Wars could want is here. I won't take up time with a synopsis, and if you don't like the price then shut up and don't buy it. It's hilarious, and the special features are great. I am talking about the $12.99 version. You still get all the comentaries, featurettes, and Seth MacFarlane's interview with George Lucas. If your like me and you enjoy good special features almost as much as the main content, you will not be disappointed. The episode runs 48 min. and there are about 45 min. of special features. NEWS FLASH FOLKS, that's just as much runtime as many feature films that don't even include a theatrical preview on the DVD, and they still retail for $12 to $15. Anyway, if your reading these reviews this DVD may not really be for you, because anyone who is a Family Guy & a Star Wars fan would certainly buy this without thinking about it, and they would inevitably be very pleased.
P.S. Don't miss the hidden Easter Egg! If you go to the ""chapter select"" menu there is a picture of Herbert/Obi Wan powering down the tractor beam. When you select it you get to see a little bit of the cast doing the table read for the ""Empire Strikes Back"" episode which is now in production. That's right, they're going to do ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" as well.",1200614400,,1310,4.439834024896266

Coming in at a scant 45 minutes, it's barely longer than an actual episode of Family Guy. That being said, the usual Family Guy humor is alive and well in this DVD. I would advise buying the non-special edition: the extras (t-shirt, collectables, etc) aren't impressive (unless you happen to wear an XL-tee and actually want to wear an XL tee with Family Guy on it - then go for it).

The extras aren't very good, either - commentary is pretty good, but the rest (including an awkward and tense interview with George lucas) are fairly boring.",1200614400,6,645,4.4576271186440675
3034000,5,B000YOX3HE,"WOW! What a treat for both the fans of Star Wars and Family Guy. I can remember when they aired this hilarious tribute episode a few months ago, I said to my fiancee they better put this one out solo on DVD and that it would be great if they gave it a bells and whistles collectors edition release. Well fans in this humble reviewers opinion they surpassed my expectations. The XL t-shirt is worth the extra few bucks alone. I couldn't be more happier with what I got here for $25-$30. This special collectors edition is loaded with special treats for us fans that you can find out more about here at amazon. I'm so glad that the t-shirt came in a larger size because everyone knows(or should know) that it's much easier for a smaller person to deal with a larger size than the other way around.

3034013,5,B000YOX3HE,"What can I say? This is without a doubt one of the best parodies ever made. As a fan of both Family guy and Star wars, I thoughouly enjoyed it. As others have stated, it is a near scene by scene parody of episode 4. The humor is top notch, but what really threw me was the original soundtrack (perfectly sync'd) and the attention to detail. For example, the opening scene was animated EXACTLY as it played out in the film. Also, little things  such as when the Millenium Falcon jumps into hyperspace and all the stars rotate clockwise around the ship. They even included one of the things that always bothered me about the original movie... when the X-wing fighters start the first attack run on the Deathstar and the three ships flip over. The last ship was flying slightly askew and the animators picked right up on it. They didn't seem to miss a thing as far as recreating each scene flawlessly.
And when it came to calling George Lucas on some of the things that did not make sense in the movie, they had me in stitches. Such as Chris (Luke) pointing out to Han that a Parsec is a unit of distance and not time. And I almost fell off the couch when they all boarded the Deathstar elevator and a Muzak version of the music for the particular scene was playing on the intercom.
Anyway, I could go on and on. Suffice it to say, this episode is a MUST SEE. There are also two scenes incuded that were not in the Television release.",1200528000,3,1431,4.319702602230484

LET'S FACE IT, the only reason the show came back was because they were making so much money off of the seasons already released. So, they bring back the show and pump out episodes. Volume 3 had what, like 14 episodes max? Anyways, combine that with releasing half of a season (Volume 5), releasing ONE episode for $15, and the ""Family Guy Movie"" which was 3 episodes (also aired as the season finale last year)... AUGH! Enough is enough already! I'm a Famly Guy fan but I'm not buying into it anymore--- and I'm a DVD COLLECTOR! I buy random dvd's all of the time, I own tons and tons of movies, I cannot buy movies without having all seasons or sets. The fact that I won't buy this is saying a lot.

3034015,5,B000YOX3HE,"There has long been a close tie between ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Wars,"" probably because the comedic dimwit geniuses who supply the laughs for ""Family Guy"" were the same geeky nerds dressing up as Stormtroopers at the sci-fi functions.  Not to put down these groups of people--God knows they came together and created one of the funniest shows on television.

""Blue Harvest"" is delightful, plain and simple.  It highlights ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" (as Peter Griffin says in the beginning segment: ""This is the story of 'Star Wars.'  Let's start with Episode 4"").  Here's the cast, and my apologies if I get some of the ""Star Wars"" names wrong: Chris Griffin as Luke Skywalker; Lois as Princess Leia; Peter as Han Solo; Brian as Chewbacca; Old Man Herbert as Obi Won Kanobi; Quagmire as C-3P0; and Cleveland as R2-D2.  No use outlining the plot; you probably know it.

The episode is hilarious.  Is it worth the money?  Well, I bought it.  I will admit, the marketing behind ""Family Guy"" has been rather shrewd as of late; releasing half a season for the price of a whole one; releasing this 48-minute episode for the price of a full-length movie; dear God, they're getting their money's worth!  But, hey, we continue to buy it.  Why?  Because we love this show.  ""Family Guy"" is not the most original thing out there, and it's not the smartest thing out there; but it's certainly one of the funniest.  And whether they're lampooning Sunday-afternoon golf, to honoring great comedic moments like Leslie Nielsen's cameo in ""Airplane"" (since I am a huge Nielsen fan, this latter provides my favorite moment of ""Blue Harvest""), the creators of ""Family Guy"" are making us laugh are butts off.  Don't spend the money if you don't want to--but I would.  In this day and age, we all need a good chuckle or two.  ""Blue Harvest"" is just as good a place to go for a laugh as any--and better than most.",1200441600,9,1898,4.648648648648648
3034016,4,B000YOX3HE,"Seth McFarlane is, clearly, a geek. I for one am quite happy about this. What other TV show is there with so many hilarious references to things like ""Speed Racer"", ""Star Trek"" and, of course, ""Star Wars""?

According to the commentary on this DVD, the show did so many SW spoofs they were told by the Legal Department they needed to knock it off or Lucasfilm might have grounds for action against them. Rather than stop, McFarlane and friends went to George Lucas and got permission to do a full hour-long episode.

The result? ""Blue Harvest"".

Not only is this a hilarious ""Star Wars"" spoof, but we also get references to things like ""American Dad"", ""Airplane!"", ""Doctor Who"", ""Robot Chicken"", the Wilhelm Scream, the pointless contents of gift-baskets and why repairing a Y-wing engine can  be risky.

There's some dead-on parody of various elements in SW, like the illogic of stormtroopers noticing that a door is locked and ignoring it, and the fact that parsecs are a measurement of distance not time. On the plus side, Han/Peter DOES shoot first, so there ya go.

Really my only real criticism of the episode is that it is, if anything, too short. But what there is of it is really good.

This collector's edition DVD set is really nice. In addition to the episode (with footage not shown on TV), you get tons of extras, including commentary and a fun interview with George Lucas! Plus, hey, trading cards and a t-shirt. The shirt is, of course, XL. Never it let it be said they don't know their fan-base.

If you like ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Wars"", buy this. If you don't, you'll sink into a cesspit of self-loathing and hatred that you'll never work your way out of... well, ok, possibly not.

- the shirt only comes in ""XL"", which you only find out when you've already purchased the DVD and opened it. We are not all as big as Peter Griffin you know. I wear ""M"" and wouldn't have made a big deal if it was at least ""L"".

- the 3D scene... what 3D?!! it looks the same with or without the glasses. The only thing I was able to see with the glasses was the image formed when putting together all the cards.

3034018,4,B000YOX3HE,"As is stated repeatedly on the Commentary Track, there was no Rotoscoping of the original film by the Family Guy artist team.  They hand-drew or computer-generated everything themselves, though you would SWEAR they painted over cells of the original film!  The artwork of the Millennium Falcon and the Imperial Star Destroyers (is that one word or two?)as they fly through space is just too good to be believed.

As for the jokes, not all are slam-dunks but there are far more hits than misses.  The only segment that brought things to a screeching halt was the ""Dirty Dancing"" musical number.

There are a few clever jokes that poke fun at the original movie's lapses in logic.  The ending is a bit abrupt, but maybe we can chalk that up to the fact that FG already did the Throne Room Medal Ceremony scene (the final scene in ""Star Wars"") in an earlier episode of the TV series.  They already used up the best ending.

I bought the collector's edition.  The bonus goodies are kinda neat so long as you buy the thing at a sale price.

The collector's edition includes a pair of 3-D glasses to watch a 3-D bonus segment following the escape from the Death Star, but the effect doesn't really work that well.

The set also includes a second disc that lets you download the entire episode to your PC or iPod.  I don't know if that is exclusive to the Collector's edition or if it comes with the standard edition too.

Collector's edition comes with a T-shirt too, but being a man of Peter Griffin-esque girth, it simply ain't gonna fit me.",1200441600,17,1537,4.545454545454546

This episode stands out as one of my favorites...clever, funny and great animation. I will admit, I am guilty of buying this DVD falling into the trap that Fox has laid out. The more I think about it the more mad I get at the way they are releasing DVD's for both THE FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD. It really shows how greedy they are and it is not good for the consumer. These are two of my favorite series on TV and I do have all of the DVDs. The problem I am now having is that they are not releasing full seasons on these box sets...and they are doing this for no other reason than to make more money. The creators of these shows should be appreciative of the fact that they have such a loyal fan base. If they didn't THE FAMILY GUY would never have been brought back. How do they repay us? By releasing DVD sets with half a season on each for the same price that other companies are releasing full seasons on DVD for! C'mon guys...wise up. Both shows are shown in repeat on multiple channels almost daily and pretty much everyone owns either a VCR or DVD recorder so taping these shows is not a problem. I myself prefer the DVD quality that you don't always get, even with an HD broadcast, but its getting to the point where I can't afford to continue buying these sets, especially when they are incomplete. I do recommend this episode to all fans of both THE FAMILY GUY and STAR WARS and I do think the deluxe set with the little bonuses is worth the price but at the rate Fox is going I doubt I will be buying any more boxed sets of half seasons.",1200355200,,1679,4.137614678899083

3034021,1,B000YOX3HE,"I tend to like the Family Guy, but this episode is devoid of originality or humor, no matter what your opinion on the pricing is.

They had under an hour to satirize the bible of sci-fi mythology, and the best they could do was a Grey Pupon joke?  How about the fact about 15% of the running time is animated versions of the spaceship scenes in the film.  There are a few witty exceptions, but for the most part, it's like watching a cartoon version of Star Wars establishing shots.  It's the laziest writing I've ever seen on this show.  The special documentary makes it sound like such an event.  But when you literally spend an entire minute playing the muzak version of the Empire Theme in its entirety, you're not making it funny by making it longer, your beating a dead horse (and burning up time you weren't creative enough to work another joke in).  You can't tell me it would have been any LESS funny if we just heard the opening bars of the song.  That way there's time for another, better gag.  And can someone explain the Italian guys on Tatooine?  What a waste of time THAT pointless ethic stereotype gag was... That made eyes roll back in the 80s!!!

Save your money and rent it, or wait until it's released as part of the season... Or don't buy it at all.  This is 20th Century Fox enabling the crummiest franchise cross-pollination since the Alien-Predator disasters.",1200355200,31,1383,4.51004016064257

Overall, if you love Family Guy you'll probably love this, I'm not huge fan of the show, though I love Stewy, so I liked it, didn't love it...",1200355200,,402,4.0886075949367084
3034033,1,B000YOX3HE,"Every once in awhile I see people complaining that Family Guy is gouging their fans. You see reviews whining about seasons being cut in half and how the Stewie special is really just three episodes put together, but none of that ever bothered me because I enjoyed the show. Sure, it's lazy a lot of the time just like the South Park guys pointed out in the Cartoon Wars episodes, but I still enjoy the show. And I always look forward to seeing a new episode on TV or a new DVD coming out.

This was no exception. And keep in mind, I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid. So, today I bought the Blue Harvest special edition.

It has a couple of decent extra items. A book on the art of making the movie, cards, 3-D glasses, a shirt... nothing amazing, but okay stuff.

In retrospect, I wish it had come with a rape whistle so that I might have alerted others to the fact that I was buying this hackneyed phoned-in garbage and gotten help instead of having to spend the night curled up in a ball at the bottom of my shower whimpering, ""they didn't even try to be funny. They just remade the movie with their characters, threw in a couple of gags, and thought that was enough. That wasn't a spoof. That was garbage. Spaceballs is a spoof. This was... this was just garbage. I was raped by garbage. I was raped by garbage. I was raped by garbage..."" until I finally turn grey, slowly break into ash, and then am washed down the drain into the sewer lines where I can finally feel clean again.

Trey, Matt... you guys were right.

I knew you were right then, I just didn't really listen. And you're right, it's not rape if you give consent. And I guess I did. I have no one to blame but myself, and the horrible, horrible jerks who thought this should have been released anywhere other than YouTube.",1200355200,40,1799,4.263929618768328
3034034,5,B000YOX3HE,"I have been a Star Wars collector since 1980 & a Family Guy fan since the show came on in 1999-been through all the seasons.

I was really looking forward to this episode.

I was NOT disappointed.

Very funny.  Normal Family Guy with a lot of other entertainment references in it.

Never would have thought Adam West would have made it into Star Wars huh?

Just needed more of Stewie as Darth.

Great animation.  Also great to have the music (Too bad John Williams did NOT make it though).  You would have had to have watched it to know this reference.

They need to start version for Empire & Jedi now.

Well done Seth MacFarlane.

I rushed out the day it was released (today) to purchase it.  It is that good.",1200355200,3,711,4.33587786259542
3034035,5,B000YOX3HE,"As already being a fan of the Star Wars Legacy and Family Guy, I was excited when I saw the commercials for the Family Guy Star Wars Special. I knew this was different then just the regular episodes, and like so many others, I tuned in and was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the storyline similar and different to the actual movies, it also had its own subtleties that made it unique to the way only Family Guy could do it. The movie is based on ""A New Hope"" (the one that came out in 1977), launching a generation of Star Wars loyalists. Everyone gets a part, and I love Stewie as Darth. It was a perfect fit as he tries yet again to conquer the world.

You can get either the regular DVD or the special edition pack. I am not really sure what's in the regular DVD, but I just bought the special edition at a store today and you get everything. Obviously, the biggest reason you would get the special edition version is because of the shirt. I love it. The details and colors are amazing. What's funny is, it looks like C-3PO/Quagmire is asking R2-D2/Cleveland about his sister's lesbot.

Additional goodies that you get are the baseball style cards, where one side you can put together and its a jigsaw puzzle (I won't spoil it for you), the 3-D glasses so you can watch the fight scene in 3-D. The 19 page booklet is included with sketches and storyboard. Another great feature is that Disc 2 includes the movie where you can transfer it to computer, video iPod, iPhone, and other portable media players. What that means is you can watch the movie on your iPhone, Zune, etc. The final piece is the box. Its actually a great finish piece that puts everything into place neatly and you can even use it as a centerpiece display to show off.

It's worth it. I don't think it's a rip-off like other people claim. You get a lot for 25 dollars, and I am happy and I know that this is something I will enjoy for a really long time. Freakin' Sweet.",1200355200,19,1946,4.34065934065934

3034039,4,B000YOX3HE,"First off I don't see how so many people can call this a ""rip-off"" when you haven't even seen the DVD itself. Also you act like Fox is FORCING us to buy this episode.

In my opinion this is the greatest Family Guy episode that has ever been made, and that is a very bold statement for anyone who is a huge Family Guy fan like I am. The source material was already strong, and all the other outside references that we are accustomed to just made it better (my favorite was the Dr. Who reference in Hyperspace.)

Just as a reminder, you do not JUST get the episode. You get some added DVD features like behind the scenes stuff, commentary tracks (Which are always great from these guys) and I believe a preview of the next Star Wars parody episode.

One could argue, ""Well, they should just put this in the regular Seasonal DVD Set."" That may be true, but on the other end, what if you don't feel like waiting for that, or if you don't feel like paying for the whole season when you just want to have this particular episode?

Instead of viewing this as a rip-off on this idea that you HAVE to buy this DVD, instead view it as a ""Gift"" by Fox in that now you can OWN this memorable and great episode. No one is forcing you to buy it, and it is an extremely funny episode that any fan of Family Guy, Star Wars, or even parody can enjoy. If for nothing besides anecdotal purposes, instead of describing to your friends how funny this episode was and having to reference everything by memory, NOW you can actually show them!",1200268800,3,1519,4.263888888888889
3034040,2,B000YOX3HE,"The uproar of the fans. The ratings on Cartoon Network. Was it not we the fans that brought this show back from extinction and then allowed Seth to not only get Family Guy back but create drivel like American Dad? And this is how we are repaid with a $13 two-episode disc or a $25 ""special edition?""

Can't help but think greed, greed, greed here. But when Lucas gave his blessing for an episode like this to happen you had to know the marketing wheels were rolling in his head, thus here we are at 48 minutes for either 13 or 25 bucks.

As for the episode itself, it was great for the most part. It has the awful let's-see-how-long-we-can-drag-it-out jokes that unfortunately Family Guy has relied on since its return. But for a fan of both Family Guy (pre-drag out jokes as long as we can) and Star Wars this is an enjoyable show.",1200182400,4,832,4.361290322580645
3034041,3,B000YOX3HE,"I agree that it's quite ridiculous to charge this much for one episode. And from what little extra features seems to be on the disk, there's little incentive to but it for such reason (not that that's a good reason to buy a DVD) Although, being the Family Guy / Star Wars geek that I am, I'd love to see that preview. And for $12 more the limited edition has a nice sized package of the typical ephemera the likes of me have come to expect from the corporate gods. If I had more money to throw away, AND I hadn't burnt the DVD of the episode by itself off my Tivo, I may have actually considered getting that limited edition. What studios like these have yet to come to terms with is that such gimmicks like this are (or at least should be) falling by the wayside due to the ease of obtaining the true meat of these items for free (and legally, I might add, there's no law or company that's trying to stop me from burning decent quality DVR recordings to DVD for my own private use). The only way they can expect to move such items is to include more for less. Otherwise, the majority of your target market is savvy, intelligent and cheap, and will continue to develop said technologies faster than corporate America can implement countermeasures.

All that aside, it's an amazing episode. I would imagine any Family Guy or Star Wars fan would thoroughly enjoy it. And (from Wikipedia): ""This episode drew 10.7 million viewers, and earned the highest Nielsen rating of any Family Guy episode since the show returned to air in 2005, making it the second most-watched episode in the series behind 'North by North Quahog' which garnered 11.9 million."" If money is no object and you don't mind indulging the studios, by all means do so. There are far worse places your money can be wasted in today's world.",1200009600,13,1802,4.477203647416413

Now they are charging this much for one episode! If they don't want to put it in the next box set, if fans don't wait until then or if someone only wants this one episode, they could at least offer it on iTunes for the standard episode fee. This is getting ridiculous. I am not paying for this and I seriously doubt that I will buy the next set. I'll just watch the reruns that are on at least 3 different channels rather than give in to their greed. I suggest others do the same and send a message.

If they really wanted to offer the fans something worthwhile and worth the money, they should have only released this version, with all the extras (the shirt, cards, etc.), at the price they are charging for the regular version with the episode only.  Other than that, this is just greed.  I don't know if it is the studio or Seth, but either way, we shouldn't stand for it.  My guess is it's the studio, so if people don't pay the high prices for low value Seth would be able stand up to them a bit more.",1200009600,42,1136,4.103603603603603
3034053,4,B000YOX3HE,"As both a die-hard Family Guy and Star Wars fan, I was thrilled when I heard about this double episode, and really enjoyed it when it aired on FOX.  I taped it while watching, but have since lost that copy so am glad they were so quick to release it on DVD.

Granted, the price is still a bit steep for just 2 episodes, but to be fair they pack it with a ton of special features and a a bonus disc with a ""portable digital copy of Blue Harvest"" that's compatible with iTunes & Windows Media Players.

But with the Special Edition, you get  much more, and as a collector and fan, that is what really appeals to me.  Just read the Product Description for the full list.  As for the actual show, fans of either franchise will probably find a lot to like.  Though it is a spoof, it remains very faithful to the original Episode IV in many respects.  The humor was great, though the some of the parts dragged a little.  The couch in the trash compactor bit was funny, but it seemed to go on bit long.  The musical numbers didn't add much for me, and I was not overly thrilled at the use of the old pedefile as Obi Wan. It seem innapropriate somehow.  For those little niggles I dropped a star.

Overall though, a fun and worthwhile package for Star Wars and Family Guy fans everywhere!
Just one other niggle -- Amazon dropped the price to just below $25 so it does not qualify for Super Saver Shipping.  Not cool guys.",1200009600,35,1684,4.703071672354949
3034054,2,B000YOX3HE,"I just can not get into Family Guy... I was happen when it returned after having been canceled for 2 or 3 years... but the quality has just lowered. Aside from having little to no plot anymore, the jokes are just redundant at this point. How many times do you watch an episode and hear ""Remember the time when..."" and based on the context and the direction the show normally takes you know the gist of what is going to happen in the upcoming joke.

I think my biggest problem with the show now is the fact that they seem to be playing off their own popularity. The first seasons before they were canceled, there were many characters introduced as one-time jokes, as I would consider them. Based on the current situation of the episode, certain characters came into play... and yes they were funny initially... but now since they were so popular among fans they keep being brought back. These include: Ali (news caster), pirate with wooden arms & legs, greased up deaf guy, Herbert (old guy who likes Chris), the chicken (fight), etc. Now in many shows, such as Simpsons, there are several characters that are there in one or two episodes a season only, and you may ask what the difference is. The characters in shows such as Simpsons are well-defined and many of which given depth. Nearly none of them (exception being the Cat Lady for example) are plagued by stereotypical jokes for that character. These reoccurring characters in Family Guy are very shallow and their jokes are redundant to the point where I find it nauseating... anytime you see one, you know exactly what jokes will occur again based on the context and the fact that these characters only will make the same style of joke/gag. Same goes for the chicken fight for example... hilarious... after the 3rd or 4th time (I forget)... it is just old at this point... come up with something original.

My point being... Blue Harvest was nothing new for me. I felt like I had already watched it. I mean, honestly, when Herbert entered in the episode and you saw the light saber... who here can honestly say they didn't see an erection joke coming?",1199923200,11,2108,4.618666666666667

My only issue with Family Guy is that while FOX broadcasts the show in HD they have yet to release any of the latest seasons on Blu-Ray.

It's nice to see Family Guy with not so many non-sequitars and more straight story (although it's not original.) Using Chris as the main character of a double length episode is kind odd since he normally doesn't get much air time in normal episodes.

You definitely have to be a big Star Wars fan AND Family Guy fan to find this funny...but if you are both you are in for a treat. The only thing I would change about this is that I think Adam West would have been a better Obi Wan Kenobi and was wasted in the role of Governor Tarkin.

You definitely have to have at least seen the original Star Wars movie to really enjoy this or else you won't get some/most of the jokes. But by this time, if you haven't seen Star Wars yet you must be living in a cave.

I don't know if this DVD is really worth $16 however. It will be available on the DVD box set for this last season (Season 6) when it comes out if you can wait that long.

3268262,2,B000YOX3HE,"Film Review
As someone who is not the biggest Family Guy fan, Blue Harvest provides a decent source of entertainment.  The references to Star Wars are generally spot on, although it obviously takes some liberties with the more specific plot points.  Most of the jokes work, but a few, like Pizza the Hut, fall flat.  The episode is an hour long special, and to pack a full two hour movie into less than an hour proves tough, with the episode skipping over a few sequences entirely.  The jokes added however, such as the entire couch sequence, are generally well done.

Blu-ray Review
Blue Harvest is in FULL SCREEN.  Why?!  There is no reason that the episode could not be in wide screen, it's not that old of an episode.  To find a blu-ray that's not in wide screen is really disheartening, and it's incredibly disappointing.  The features are rather bare also, with a few comically bad interviews, and that's about it.  What a shame.",1388016000,,935,4.646341463414634

It follows the basic story line of A New Hope but makes a joke out of everything. As with all Family Guy episodes, generally there's bound to be a few jokes that hit or miss with different people, but definitely if you're a fan of Family Guy you should check this extended episode out. On top of being extended, the animation is superior to the regular episodes

The special features are much better than anything you get from South Park.  I found this box filled with the usual top notch extras Family Guy is known for.  You get a great full length commentary, an interview with George Lucas that runs about 15mins, the animatic, behind the scenes about the creation, promos, and a sweet reel of all the times Family Guy has made Star Wars during the shows run.  This least feature was unexpected and runs a lot longer than you'd think.  I got a lot of bang for the buck out of this and I hope you will too.",1351209600,,709,4.214814814814815

It's extremely funny, well written, short yet sweet and it has Stewie as Dath Vadar, what more could you want? Condensing the whole Star Wars film into about 45-50 minutes, this film still manages to pack in hilarious gags and parodies the original, whilst still being deferential to it's influence on `Family Guy' itself. Seeing Stewie as Vadar, picking holes in the death stars design flaws and Peter as Han Solo, who rings his mum to let her know he's OK after a space battle, are just a few minor touches (out of many) that make this so delightful to watch. It may be short, but this is perfectly formed and if you're fan of `Family Guy' then this will be right up your street and if you've never seen it before then this isn't that bad a place to start either!

In case you are unfamiliar with Blue Harvest: The creators of Family Guy took the entire Star Wars IV - A New Hope, squeezed it down to about an hour, and retold the story using the cast of Family Guy. They perfectly mimic scenes and details from the original movie, then throw in all that extra Family Guy dry humor that we've grown to love so much.

They have since re-done Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as well, but this one is definitely the best of the 3. The whole trilogy is very reasonably priced.

The first thing you notice is the score, it is, well the score for Star Wars, (except when they do the theme to ""The People's Court"".  It demonstrates that music really makes the mood.

Of course the nearly shot for shot sequence, a faithfulness to the story with the normal family guy gags peppered in makes it s must have for Star Wars fans.

Instead of actually poking fun at Star Wars with clever scene twists, unasked questions, or any of the like, Seth and his team bank on the childish humor of distracting from the plot-line, replacing Star Wars characters with Family Guy characters (Meg as the garbage chute monster, Stewie as Darth Vader, Herbert the pervert as Obi-Wan, etc.), and of course, the pointless, overused Family Guy lines that any viewer is far more than familiar with.

3268313,5,B000YOX3HE,"The main motive of the success that is 'Family Guy' is to rip upon all that is pop culture politics and everything in between. But, give creator Seth McFarlane a chance to make fun of Star Wars... and you get a true comical masterpiece.

We begin by understanding what exactly is the concept of parody. A parody is taking an original piece of work and mocking it by adding crude comedy, slapstick and the possible musical number. Mel Brooks did it well, Trey Parker and Matt Stone did it well and let's not forget David Zucker's classic 'Airplane!' But, when it comes to the holy of holys' The creators of Family Guy did something much more.
'Family Guy: Blue Harvest' is actually the first Star Wars film shrunk into 45 minutes with of course the usual Family Guy humor. There are no made up characters, just the cast members of 'Family Guy' playing the 'Star Wars' characters. There are actual lines from the orginal movie used and then given a spin. There are also comedic lines that play upon the 'Star Wars' lore to please the true fans To put it in lamenst terms this is pretty much if George Lucas intended on 'Star Wars' to be a space comedy and not a dramtic fantasy space opera. You still have the traditional 'Family Guy' brand comedy, meaning make sure you have either seen a lot of movies, watched a ton of TV and played bored/video games in your years. The other thing I love is the characters still have the same personalities they bring on the actual show in this special. The perfect example would be Quagmire and Cleavland playing C-3PO and R2-D2.

This was one of the best 'Family Guy' episodes I had ever seen since the show first aird after the 1999 Super Bowl. I am also glad that this specific episode was not included in one of the series volumes. Like 'Stewie Griffen: The Untold Story' 'Blue Harvest' is in fact a separate entity on it's own and to be placed along side the series. Sure you have to shell out some extra cash, but believe me, this is so worth it. I mean even the DVD box and DVD main menu are an exact replica of the origional! I am very excited to know that the crew of 'Family Guy' will in fact be making two more specials spoofing the next two 'Star Wars' films. I am happy to know that they will also be sold on their own and still keeping to the new tradition that has been put in place thanks to 'Blue Harvest.' I sure hope that there will be a prequel trilogy as well. So 'Star Wars' and 'Family Guy' fans alike enjoy this very sepcial gift and begin a new tradition as I have. Watch the original film and cap it off with 'Family Guy'!",1250899200,,2584,4.336776859504132

The scenes look so much like Star Wars: A New Hope but with funny little differences that you sometimes have to watch several times to catch.  I especially like the Bush/Cheney bumper sticker on the Imperial ship.  Too funny!,1243555200,,293,4.596153846153846

I have never laughed out loud so many times than watching this show except seeing the ""Star Wars"" edition.  Being a Gen-X-er and having watched the early Star Wars movies with my younger brother over a dozen times while growing up (like most my age) I found myself anticipating and quoting the original Star Wars dialogue along with the Family Guy characters then rolling into laughable hysterics when they changed something from the original script (like when Stewie waves his hand to suffocate the naysayer underling who scoffs at his lack of real estate knowledge as it pertains to the DeathStar - TOO CUTE)!

Of course, there are some really twisted moments that younger viewers shouldn't be allowed to watch (i.e. the old man who plays Ben Kenobi - while super funny, his character is distasteful - lol.  C3PO/Quagmire's character is a bit rough too).  Overall, though, this episode is fantastic and will keep you in stitches from beginning to end.  My husband and I still laugh and make reference to it if we're ever reminded of something that happened in the show.  Buy this.  Watch it when you're having a bad day or when you need a little emotional lift.  You won't regret it.",1222041600,,1288,4.688888888888889

This version includes a shirt, trading cards, and 3D glasses to watch the exclusive to this version 3d fight scene. Unless you're a really serious FG fan, just get the regular edition. The cards and shirt are cool, but the 3D scene is a waste. The quality is poor, and not worth bothering with, which is why I rate it 4 stars not 5. I loved the extras like Seth McFarlane's interview with George Lucas. He would hum tunes from different parts of different Star Wars movies, and see if George knew what part the tune came from. George missed them all. Classic. Either way, this dvd is awesome!",1221782400,,681,4.3700787401574805

But the story... they weren't too inventive, really. Basically copying the original story line. I had to buy this because I am a great fan of Star Wars and parody. But in terms of originality, I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robot-Chicken-Star-Wars/dp/B0012Q3T6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robot Chicken: Star Wars</a>&nbsp;, which I bought at the same time from Amazon, was far more inventive and funny.
One thing about both DVDs is that both the creators are called Seth, and if they could have kept the humor clean my young sons who are big Star Wars fans would have been able to watch it. I guess some writers think dirty is funny...

*Very hilarious parodies of ""Star Wars"" and other stuff (also expect parodies of ""Vacation,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Breakfast Club,"" and others).  For ""Star Wars"" in particular, the show emulates most of the movie almost exactly, before breaking into the humor.
*Some very good original jokes too.
*Some funny inside jokes.
*Very good animation quality.

The Bad Things
*Ummmmm....

The Questionable Things
*Some bad language and crude humor.  Not reccomended for most kids or families.
*Not sure why this is called ""Blue Harvest."" Is it because Luke likes blue milk, or what?

I'm not really a ""Family Guy"" fan, but I still enjoyed this.  It's a good, funny, short feature that made me laugh pretty good.  Highly reccomended for anybody who enjoys trashing ""Star Wars.""

DVD has good video and sound quality.  It is in a fullscreen format.  It includes a great number of special features, including an animatic version of the show, some interviews and featurettes, and commentaries.

I even like it better than the new Clone Wars clips available so far. The characters are funny and seem to be well suited for these roles in particular Stewie(playing Darth Vader). This parody puts a fresh spin on this science fiction legend. Though not the idealistic cast for such roles, the faults and limitations of this cartoon family is what we like the most about them.",1217894400,,541,4.530612244897959

Now I'm not a Star Wars fan but I've seen the movie & the spoof they did here was right on the money...with a couple of shots done on other movies like Breakfast Club, National Lampoon's Vacation, and Airplane.  This was like the Family Guy of old where the jokes were funny a majority of the time without using tons of cutaway jokes & heavy ""uncensored"" language to make up for the lack of story.  This is one Family Guy disc that you can watch over & over again close together & still laugh at the time stuff that doesn't get old.  The only thing that I thought sucked was that the only part they had for Meg was a 2 second cameo.  The DVD extras weren't much past the alternative commentary & a clip show of all the Star Wars references they've done throughout the run of the series but the other extras were an interview with George Lucas, a ""making of"" feature, and the animatic version.  In the end, the main feature is less than an hour long but it was entertaining enough to get the DVD set itself so I recommend & look forward to them spoofing the other movies in the future if they're going to be as good as this one.",1216512000,,1358,4.203846153846154
3268335,2,B000YOX3HE,"""Blue Harvest"" is Family Guy at its worst. First, it's not as much a parody of Star Wars as it is a parody of other things, like ""Airplane"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" just to name a few. Sure, all the main characters in Star Wars are replaced by the Griffins, but most of the jokes aren't about Star Wars. All of the gags could've been reused in any other Family Guy parody, but, of course, that's how Family Guy always is.

3268337,5,B000YOX3HE,"For those who are regular watchers of Family Guy you will already know how easily they parody TV shows and movies in sketches that literally last a few seconds. Now they've decided to go one better and make a feature length episode as a parody of Star Wars Episode 4, and let me tell you this is just as strong as those few second long clips. Here is the scrolling writing that Star Wars is famous for but with a Family Guy twist on it all.

A long time ago, but somehow in the future.

Episode IV

It is a time of civil war,
and renegade paragraphs
floating through space.

There's cool space battles,
and the bad guy is the
good guy's dad, but you
don't find that out 'til the
next episode.

And the hot chick is really
the sister of the good
guy, but they don't know it,
and they kiss. which is
kind of messed up. I mean,
what if they had done it
instead of just kissed?

Angelina Jolie kissed her
brother. Yeah, she did. You
know it, I know it and
her Dad knows it. That's
why they hardly ever talk
anymore. You can run away to
Africa, but you can't run
away from the truth.

Oh, by the way, here's
a tip for you: when this
is over, go out and rent
the movie ""Gia."" She's way
naked in it, and makes out
with another chick and
everything. It's awesome.
I stumbled across it late
at night on HBO after I
had just got back from
hockey, and I almost
fainted. But I digest...

Princess Leia was coming
back from buying space
groceries when this
happened...

When reading that at the start of this, I just knew that the episode would be amazing. Chris as Luke, Lois as Leia, Stewie as Darth Vader, Peter as Han, Brian as Chewbacca and Hebert as Obie Wan Kenobie. Other Family Guy characters obviously take other roles from the Star Wars universe and they all blend together in a brilliant movie/feature length episode.

Buy it. I promise you won't be disappointed.",1214697600,,1862,4.2492917847025495
3268338,5,B000YOX3HE,"I grew up in the 70's, so of course like all boys at that time, I loved KISS and Star Wars. Now I'm in my mid 30's and love Family Guy. You have to be my age to 'get' a lot of the Family Guy humor. When I saw that Family Guy did a Star Wars special, I didn't even read the back of the package or look at the price. I just grabbed it and went to the register.

The Blue Harvest is very faithful to the original Episode IV of Star Wars. The characters are 'in character' with their Star Wars counterparts. For instance, who else but Stewie could play Darth Vader? Well maybe Joe if you went by the 'part man part machine' angle, but c'mon who is as evil as Stewie and wants to kill Leia, who of course is played by Lois. My daughter was a little disappointed that Meg (her favorite character) was a two second cameo, but other than that we all laughed until we were Blue Harvested in the face.

Brian is brilliant as Chewbacca, I wonder if maybe Meg could have played Leia since Cris played Luke as they are brother and sister, but then where would you fit Lois? And if you did that then Peter would have to be Darth Vader as he is the father of Luke and Leia. Now granted Peter could have done some hilarious things as Darth Vader, but I think Seth and the gang hashed all this out and I think their final product was very very funny, and that's all that matters isn't it?

I for one enjoyed the old pediphile as Obi-Wan. When the limp light-saber went erect I thought it was a great gag, but his musical number could have been left out. That may be the only scene I would have questioned keeping in. It wasn't offensive, it just slowed the story down a bit and we probably could have done without it since it isn't that memorable.

But all in all this is a MUST HAVE for any and all Family Guy fans and maybe Star Wars fans as well.",1214265600,,1832,4.066481994459834
3268339,5,B000YOX3HE,Seth did a great job with this one. If you like the family guy and star wars and also have a sense of humor this is a must see.,1214006400,,127,3.413793103448276
3268340,2,B000YOX3HE,"The idea is easy to follow-Family Guy does a Star Wars bit. Now, as a fan of both, I was bored. There are many small scenes that are  almost perfect recreations of actual scenes from the movie. Had they not been slow, boring backrounds without talking that didn't add to the plot that would have been fine. Add a few of these and it might get on your nerves. Good effort, but Ive seen it, I know it, I don't need to see it again.

The second problem with this is the jokes. Just like the Stewie Movie, the good jokes are scarce. There is one running gag throughout involving Peter and a great Meg appearance that got me going, but other then that there aren't many good lines for any of the other characters. That and a song that I could have done without.

Rent it, or if your a serious Family Guy fan buy one of the dvds used for cheap, but I cant see spending real money on this.",1213920000,2,882,4.116279069767442

I had to buy this because ""it's so good, it just has to be fattening.' I love every minute of this movie.

3268348,5,B000YOX3HE,"While it may seem not worth it to purchase a feature that only goes for 48 minutes the DVD comes with a heap of features that take as long to watch as the film. You get a full length commentary by Seth McFarlane and other important people involved in the show, an interview between Seth and George Lucas which is a bit of an insight into George's life and answers many rumours Star Wars fans have put out there about the making of the original films. An animatic version of the entire film (I don't really see much point to this myself but its there). The clips from the regular season episodes of Family Guy where they made fun of, or parodied a Star Wars movie scene. An introduction to Family Guy, which is a clip show telling the viewer who has never watched a regular episode about each family member and a few scenes of them in action. A documentary on the making of Blue Harvest where the veiwer learns the significance of the name, that they're also doing Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as well and you also get to see Blue Harvest being made. There's also a normal Family Guy episode as well.

I was really impressed by the Blue Harvest. I'm no passionate fan who knows every sentence ever written of either Family Guy or Star Wars but I have enjoyed watching both. I thought Blue Harvest was really well done even from the opening rolling text gags like we later find out Leia and Luke are brother and sister and he kissed her once in this episode, imagine if they had done more, to Peter (whose telling the tale) getting sidetracked and going on about a movie where he saw Angelina Jolie naked and where she was making out with a woman. The movie itself is also full of gags including spot appearances by non Star Wars movie characters such as the Griswalds from National Lampoon's Vacation. I thought the ""what are we getting charged per laser now?"" line when they decide not to fire on an empty of life forms lifepod, as well as ""well you can just sit here and rot then you stuck up @#!*"" when Leia (Lois) pays out her rescuer with ""aren't you a little fat for a stormtrooper"" were two of the funniest parody scenes I've ever seen.

Unfortunately I think the ""blessing"" from George Lucas to make this movie, actually became a ""curse"".  Since Seth McFarlane and crew could do whatever they wanted, they didn't have to be creative in their parody, they could just animate scenes from the movie, which is all they did!

The only laughs I got were when Chris/Luke Skywalker responds to Lois/Leia's snotty remark with, ""Then stay here and rot, b***"", the two Death Star Technicians talking on the bridge before beng killed and Adam West talking about how they stole his couch.

The real point of interest on the DVD is the interview with George Lucas where the questions real fans want answered are asked.

Blue Harvest is another foray into well explored Family Guy territory, nothing new here. The same jokes are recycled over again, but this time set in the immensly  popular Star Wars world, which adds an interesting spin and will make fans and geek boys alike smile with nerdish glee.

Blue Harvest will entertain most people, but will you laugh out loud like you used to? Depends on what you think of the latest season of Family Guy, if you starting to get a little over Family Guy, then don't expect this DVD to be redeeming. If you are still in love with the whole idea of Family Guy, then you will probably love this presentation.

The specials included in this set are all above expectations and will keep fans happy indeed, heaps of bonuses and interesting features, but seriously, what a load of bollocks!!!

Yes, $[...] is a lot for one episode, but there are some nifty bonuses on the disc. There is a behind-the-scenes, a commentary, an interview between Seth McFarlene and George Lucas, and a special extra: you can watch the cast read-through of Family Guy's next Star Wars spoof (the slated title is ""Something Something Something Dark Side"").

Also, it comes with an extra disc for your computer so that you may download it for free and put it on your iPod/PSP.

I have seen it said here that it makes no sense to sell this separately. It does, however, if you want a fun gift for a Star Wars fan, or a little gift for a Family Guy fan. Or, if you're like me, if you missed it when it aired and don't want to wait for the next season to come out on DVD.

As far as the quality of the episode is concerned, I thought this was hilarious. John Bender (Breakfast Club) makes an appearance, for example. Basically, this won't be funny if you don't go in with some knowledge of basic Pop Culture. If you only know things about Star Wars and Sci-Fi, it won't be AS funny (but it will still be hilarious).

3268390,2,B000YOX3HE,"Out of all the things Family Guy has put on DVD this has got to be the bottom of all bottom. Why you ask?Well because this DVD only has one single episode on it,that's enough to make any DVD stink. In an age where we can get full seasons of nearly every show why should someone even bother to buy this. I mean even the old VHS tapes had more episodes on them! First they release half seasons set with season 4 and then season five is missing 5 episodes on the season set,now this i don't think any fan or casual for what matters would really approve this it would be supporting Fox in doing this. Fox is really trying to take advantage of the Family Guy fans,what do they think we are stupid?They only took advantage of the Star Wars theme and that's it,there's ""Blue Harvest"".The stupid thing is that the Blue Harvest episode will enventually be released on the season 6 DVD whitin a year probably,so if you think this really is worth it at 15$ for one episode,you must be nuts.

Unless you agree with Fox's politics of ripping off fans,you should be as angry as i am towards this release. This is probably the worst Fox release ever,most could pass but not this one. The problem ain't the episode,in fact ""Blue Harvest"" is a very good Family Guy episode and its fun to see the characters as Star Wars characters(Stewie is Darth Vader,Chris is Luke,Lois is Lea,Peter is Han Solo,Brian is Chewbacca,i liked Quagmire as C-3PO and Meg has a small role,that is kind of funny)but with that big Family Guy touch in it! Being a fan of both i really enjoyed this episode when it aired in late 2007,the references were really funny(Dr. Who,Dirty Dancing and more!)but this single episode DVD release is what i am angry against. The episode would probaby get a rating somewhere along the four-five stars but this DVD,i am sorry is not even worth one star. Unless you absolutely have to see this episode again and can't wait for season 6th to be released,feel the need to spend 15$ in an awfull way or you are a obsessive Family Guy fan that needs everything on the subject,then this isn't for you. Don't tell i didn't warn you!

Its not that i am a critic that has a taste for giving low ratings,i don't generally give one stars reviews as those are pretty rare from me but when i have to i do. This is one of those cases where i give a one star review and i do feel my rating is appropriate for the item. Actually this a double episode as it was on televison,meaning that there are in fact two episodes on this disc,we are lucky Fox put both on it! The good thing is that they don't FORCE you to buy it bt still it is an awfull product,understand me. If you have an Ipod video there is a digital copy of the episode to put on it,wich is nice but what if you don't have that?Its no utility for them,but for those who do,its great that is a nice feature. The bonus features you get on this are cool and it is stuffed with tons of bonus features,that would have been nice to see on the season 6 set,but because they released it at this time,there is possibility it might not be on the season set,but that would surprise me.

The episode might have deserved a special release but they could have done a little more adding a few episodes or something,i mean the episode and all the features are great but...It is also to note that this episode is basicly episode IV of Star Wars a la Family Guy meaning there might and will probably be more of those Family Guy/Star Wars episodes in the future. The cover of the DVD is very similiar to the cover of Episode IV,actually its pretty much the same with the Family Guy's characters as Star Wars's. If you really want this episode however i think you might like the special edition more as it has even more stuff on it and with the shirt and all you get its probably worth it a little more. It is close to ten bucks more tought,25$ at the time of reviewing wich makes it close to the price of a season set. You must ask yourself how much you really wanyt and need this and wich edition to get,i won't get it but you can.",1204070400,3,4051,4.29281045751634

I kept waiting for the next awesome ""like that one time"" scene but compared to the average Season 5 episode, there's no comparison.

As much as I love Family Guy, I hate FOX with a deep passion. Not only do they have no respect for Seth McFarlane having canceled this show already how many times now, but they just want to milk every dime out of its fan base. There's no reason why they should be splitting seasons in half and charging the same price, let alone glorifying this one ""slightly longer"" episode like its the best thing ever in an attempt to make more money.

3268434,4,B000YOX3HE,"The highly popular TV show Family Guy has become a source of pop culture amongst fans that have supported it even after it was originally canceled. The surge of interest when the show appeared on DVD eventually got the series to be reinstated, and now the beloved dysfunctional family is back for their second feature length special. Series creator Seth McFarlane has long been a considerable fan of Star Wars, and so for Family Guy Presents: Blue Harvest, the hilarious characters all take over familiar roles as the heroes and villains of the galaxy far, far away.

The story of a young farmer who dreams of battling the evil galactic empire up in the far reaches of space, needs no explaining. Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, the faithful droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 and the ruthless Darth Vader all make an appearance - as highly stylized transformations into Family Guy personalities. The constantly calculating Stewie portrays the Dark Lord of the Sith, simple-minded Chris plays Luke, ""Family Guy"" Peter Griffin is an overweight Han Solo, Brian is a short Chewbacca, Lois is Leia, and Cleveland and Quagmire are R2-D2 and C-3P0 respectively. Other delightfully witty appearances are made by Herbert the pedophile, as Obi-Wan, Mayor Adam West as Grand Moff Tarkin (voiced by none other than Adam West), and even Meg (the constant butt of jokes) as the Dianoga trash compactor serpent.

While much of the film looks to have been rotascoped and cartoon shaded to perfectly match the movements of the original movie elements, such as Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters (with Thai pilots) and the fast-maneuvering Millennium Falcon, Blue Harvest is not without its unique moments of bizarre deviations from the original story. A flamboyant dance sequence with Ben Kenobi was somehow expected and yet so drastically different from anything you'd normally find in a Star Wars parody, and the need for Han Solo to snag a well-worn couch from the trash compacter during their escape, sees the heroic team attempting feats far less relevant to aiding the Rebellion.

But of course the best part of any Family Guy outing is the constant stabs at politics, people, places, religion, other shows and any idea that can be stretched to pluck a laugh from. Parodying not only the famous moments from Star Wars (A New Hope as well as the other episodes), Blue Harvest proceeds to jest at the expense of Angelina Jolie, golf, Christianity, American Dad, elevator music, Magic Johnson, Big Red chewing gum, Robot Chicken, and Chevy Chase to name but a few. The TV show is built on references to such a vast array of pop culture that some jokes you get and others you don't, but they keep coming in a fast pace, so there's no time to dwell on bits that are just out of reach of your subconscious.

Family Guy Presents: Blue Harvest is a perfect delight for fans of the TV show, and doubles as a main attraction for anyone who has grown up with the influences of Star Wars. Familiar Family Guy faces appear at every turn, but the jokes are often even droller if you've kept up with the regular series. By no means a perfect spoof, Blue Harvest is a must-own for fans of Family Guy, a show that has been stretching the boundaries of cartoon decency for a very long time and now within a George Lucas approved galaxy far, far away.

3268456,5,B000YOX3HE,"One of the best episodes of my absolute favorite show EVER! Although many people seem to thumb their noses at Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy there are many more like myself who appreciate and enjoy the style of humor presented in this show and American Dad. The writing talent of all involved showcases a true understanding of human nature and the way they hold a mirror to us and allow us to see how we as a people behave at times is priceless. Anyone that dislikes Family Guy and the situations and cutaway topics generally do not like the way many people behave as a whole and perhaps see something within themselves that they do not care for. I on the other hand embrace my quirks and the imperfect personality traits of others.

This episode, for those who don't know, is the retelling of ""Star Wars Episode 4 - A New Hope"" using a large assortment of classic Family Guy characters in place of the original characters created by George Lucas. The title ""Blue Harvest"" was chosen as that was the working title used to keep a low profile during the filming of ""Return Of The Jedi"" and everyone felt that would be a real nice tip of the hat to the true fans. Of course, as most episodes released on DVD for this show, there are extra and extended scenes making this uncensored version even more entertaining.

There is also a plethora of bonus features including a discussion between MacFarlane and Lucas that shows how positive Lucas' reaction was to the creation of this episode and how his children are HUGE Family Guy fans, a complete animatic of the episode showing some different bits and scenes not produced for the final episode, and an informative and entertaining audio commentary where Seth names his favorite karaoke hideout. The limited edition box set also contains a unique T-shirt, a booklet showcasing some of the original artwork created during the production of the episode, 3-D glasses to use while watching the 3-D fight scene and a set of trading cards made to look like the original Star Wars trading cards from the late 70's.

A fantastic set and worth every penny. There is a comment made that the Family Guy staff plans to release Empire and Jedi as well, so I hope the networks finally give the writers their due and this writers strike ends soon so we can get the next season of Family Guy underway. Seth, you ROCK, man!

3268462,3,B000YOX3HE,"I'll keep this as brief as possible.  Family Guy: Blue Harvest will be a major dissapointment to all but die hard Family Guy and Star Wars fans, of which I am both.  But even with that said, I was still not very happy about this.  Excluding the first season, I would say that this episode (and let's not kid ourselves here, it's not a movie, it's an episode) ranks in the least funny.  With so many chances for good gags, I was constantly surprised at the lame jokes that the writers chose to make.  I would say that the funniest bits were during the intro and outro segments with the family sitting on the couch.  It's true that the animation here is top-notch, and they did an incredible job of matching scenes from the original film but, frankly, if I want to see those scenes played out with that kind of detail, I'll just watch the original, thanks.  All that being said, if you are a compulsive collector of DVDs as I am, this is the only way you will own this episode (those that say they are waiting for this episode to be released with the regular season set are kidding themselves).

Regarding the Digital Copy included with the DVD version; completely useless.  It can only be used a single time, and if you don't make use of it within 12 months of the episode's release, your right to use it basically becomes invalid.  Plus, according to the reading I did from the disc's faq, it's non-transferable, so once you have it on your computer (or ipod or whatever) it can't be copied over or re-installed if you get a new system (I may not be 100% on all of this, but this is how it works as best as I could figure it...reading terms of use agreements makes my eyes cross).  With these kinds of limitations, why include a digital copy at all?  Better to have skipped it and lowered the overall price of this DVD.",1201478400,12,1819,4.349112426035503

most of it was just a synopsis of Episode IV with different actors and throw in the requisite amount of profanity and toilet humor. There were precious few truly clever scenes and most of them were in the trailer clips. (I did think the scene of the guy sitting in front of his trailer with a light-saber being used as a bug-zapper was quite original, though.  And, as an older viewer, I appreciate the ""Airplane!"" reference.) And as a Christian I was much more offended by the Storm-trooper Church sequence than the suggestion that ""the Force"" is perceived as mostly gnostic anti-Christian.

Family Guy: Blue Harvest somehow manages to pack in almost everything from the original Star Wars film into 48 hysterical animated minutes, and features Peter as Han Solo, Chris as Luke Skywalker, Lois as Princess Leia, Brian as Chewie, Quagmire as C-3P0, Cleveland as R2D2, the creepy old guy as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and of course, Stewie as Darth Vader.  Like any other episode of Family Guy, there are plenty of visual gags, in-jokes, ramblings, and pop culture stabs combined with the Star Wars mythology, with the only complaint really being that Family Guy: Blue Harvest is too short.  That aside, this is a fun episode and tribute that Family Guy fans and Star Wars fans alike will enjoy, and the Robot Chicken debate between Peter and Chris (voiced by Seth Green, who created the aforementioned show) is hysterical as well.",1200960000,,1086,4.827956989247312

3268484,4,B000YOX3HE,"I was a little surprised at how short the show was (about 45min). At first I thought it was a little more than hour especially since the Star Wars movies topped 2 hours in length. I was amazed at how Seth McFarlane (the creator of Family Guy) was able to condense the rendition of Star Wars into a Family Guy episode.
 As usual Family Guy had its brand of raunchy (just the way I like it) humor. While it was spread out, the laughs were loud and almost brought you to tears (deep laughs). Usually when I'm watching Family Guy, the laughs are all over the place and almost at every second. In Blue Harvest, they were more spread out.
 If you love the Star Wars saga you are going to like Blue Harvest. It's Family Guy's interpretation of Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope. The special edition Blue Harvest DVD package is loaded with a lot of goodies not seen in other special editions. Other special editions usually mean deleted scenes, interviews with only one or two stars of the movie as well as the director. This special edition package gives you an XL t-shirt of the picture on the box (very nice), trading cards, 3-D glasses for a small segement of the show when Peter/Han Solo and Chris/Luke Skywalker are in the falcon shooting the Tie-fighters, 2 dvd;s (one is the movie the other is a disc that allows you to download the show onto your computer or ipod, and some reading material (storyboards and concept art). The DVD is also packed with interviews with a noticably uneasy George Lucas the creator and billionare of anything Star Wars. He needs to grow up, its not like he only has a penny in his pocket. Even though Family Guy goes one step further than The Simpsons, Im sure Seth McFarlane gave him a little extra for his overflowing purse. Or is he still seething over the media crying that Revenge of the Sith was too violent. I remember when George Lucas shot back by saying,"" Hey, it's a civil war, not a stroll in the park!""
If you like Family Guy you will love the special edition package and its contents. If you're not the type to get special edition DVD's you will enjoy this one. It's only an extra $10 than most regular DVD's. If the shirt that is included in the special edition DVD was available in stores, you would be paying at least $8-$10. So add this with the $10-$12 regular DVD package and all you get is the DVD and the shirt. Not bad for $24 for the Blue Harvest Special Edition and ALL of its goodies.
 I was a little disapointed with the length of the ""spoof"" of Star Wars and how the laughs were spread out longer than they would of been in a regular 30min episode of Family Guy. I'm sure if the movie was longer, there would be more laughs. Finally, I feel bad for Meg (the daughter). See the show and you'll se why.",1200873600,,2755,4.345631067961165
3268485,5,B000YOX3HE,"I am a huge fan of STAR WARS, but I'm not a huge fan of FAMILY GUY. However, I do watch the show occasionally from time to time and I noticed that the show makes quite a few references to STAR WARS. When I had heard that FAMILY GUY was going to be spoofing STAR WARS for its 2007-08 season premiere, I made sure to watch. It was one of the best spoofings of STAR WARS I have seen on television and one of the few FAMILY GUY episodes that would be okay for families to watch together.

That episode, ""Blue Harvest"", has now been released in a special extended edition on DVD. The episode is about forty-five minutes and follows the plot of STAR WARS fairly closely with plenty of FAMILY GUY humor thrown in. Chris plays Luke, Lois plays Leia, Peter plays Han Solo, Brian plays Chewbacca, Stewie plays Darth Vader, and Meg makes a brief appearance as the monster in the garbage pit of the Death Star. Guest voices include a wide range from Rush Limbaugh to Helen Redding.

True to FAMILY GUY style, there are some jokes and language on this DVD episode, though not too much, that didn't air when the show was first broadcast. Extras on the DVD include a commentary with Seth MacFarlane, director Dominic Polcino, and other writers, producers, editors, and artists; a conversation between Seth MacFarlane and George Lucas; a making of featurette entitled ""Once in a Lifetime: The Making of Blue Harvest""; the animatic version of the episode; a FAMILY GUY Star Wars clip show featuring references to the movies used in the show; and a trailer for FAMILY GUY. I found the conversation between MacFarlane and Lucas to be most enjoyable of the extras because Lucas doesn't grant many interviews like that and because MacFarlane asked him a lot of questions that would not be asked otherwise. The ""Once in a Lifetime"" featurette was also enjoyable as it allowed many people who were behind the scenes to share their love of STAR WARS and tell their story of being involved with this particular FAMILY GUY episode. The animatic version of the episode will probably only interest those who have a serious interest in film or art--this is the version of the film used as a test for the studios before it was shipped overseas for coloring and perfecting.

Recommended for fans of STAR WARS. FAMILY GUY fans might also be interested, but this episode will be a part of the 6th Season DVD set so you might want to just wait until then. I also recommend this episode as an introduction episode to show people who have never seen FAMILY GUY but enjoy the type of humor on the show and would probably enjoy watching the series.",1200787200,,2610,4.572649572649572
3268486,5,B000YOX3HE,"Family Guy's homage to Star Wars is hilarious. The FG character's slip easily into their SW personas while still keeping their original personalities. Stewie is a natural choice as Darth Vader. Some of the others, like Chris as Luke and Peter as Han Solo, seem odd at first, but the writers do such a good job you buy into it. The whole episode has a deep, rich look to it. They follow the story with exactness using the original dialog whenever possible. They've copied every detail to pull you into the Star Wars universe.

Some of the jokes are pure Family Guy, like when Luke is staring out at the twin suns of Tatooine and the music swells, Chris/Luke turns and says ""John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra everybody"" and there they are playing the score. The Chris/Luke has them play the theme to the People's Court. Other jokes are based on observations I never would have made. On board the Millenium Falcon, when Luke/Chris says to Peter/Han ""You don't believe in the force, do you?"", Han/Peter replies, ""You mean that thing you just found out about 3 hours ago and are now judging me on?""

Blue Harvest is a very funny, very well made episode and I'm glad to hear they are going to do the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.",1200787200,5,1251,4.530973451327434

Oh, but this is HIGH-BROW, because they called it 'Blue Harvest', the secret filming name of ROTJ.  Aren't these people clever?  Or maybe just pretentious.
The jokes in this are stale, and have been done over and over already.  The only legitimate laugh was John Williams accidentally being killed and replaced with a dull and repetitive Danny Elfman.  Hey, waitaminute... maybe that's the irony of this:
Danny Elfman = dull and repetitive composer
Family Guy = dull and repetitive Simpsons ripoff in a tired Star Wars parody.",1200700800,10,763,5.056
3268489,5,B000YOX3HE,"I first saw this on Fox in Fall 2007, and instantly loved it! It's got all the classic witty humor of Family Guy with a Star Wars twist.
One of the best things about Seth Macfarlane's parodies is that they're always accurate. Macfarlane does his home work before he makes a parody, so they're always accurate, always funny, and always hit their mark!

The story pretty much starts off with Peter telling everyone his take on Star Wars after a power outage to entertain his family. From there it's all a hilarious parody of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

The DVD itself is great too, has plenty of special features to watch if you're into that sort of thing, and it even comes with a 2nd disk to download a free digital copy of Blue Harvest to your Computer & ipod!

In short, this DVD is pure comic gold. If you like Family Guy and Star Wars Parodies like ""Space Balls"" then you won't be disappointed by Blue Harvest.
Don't be fooled by other reviews that give this DVD 1 star, they're mostly Star Wars nerds who don't like anything that parodies their perfect movie. Well, shame on them... I myself am a fan of Star Wars, and I find Blue Harvest to be hilarious and the jokes very accurate to Star Wars. I even hope that Seth will make parodies of Star Wars Episodes V & VI (The Empires Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi) as well.

3268490,5,B000YOX3HE,"I read some of the negative reviews on this site about the movie before I bought it and was questioning how good it would be.  I bought it because I figured those bad reviews weren't from Family Guy/Star Wars fans, and I loved the movie!  After being a lifelong Star Wars fan, it was cool to see a cartoon copy it out of respect and add the 21st century humor.  If you respect Star Wars and love Family Guy, you'll love this, period.",1200700800,,433,4.192771084337349
3268491,5,B000YOX3HE,"Fans of the television hit animated show FAMILY GUY are die hard fans. They love each and every thing there is to know about the Griffin family. We all have our favorites (but face it, nearly everyone loves infant Stewie). But the Griffin family can not be contained on this planet as is seen in this week's release, FAMILY GUY PRESENTS BLUE HARVEST.

The title is a reference to the filming title of George Lucas' hit ""Return of the Jedi"", one of those lesser known facts that fanatics of the STAR WARS films know by heart. Yes, the fanatics of one show meet with those of another as the Family Guy group takes on Star Wars. This isn't much of a leap if you watch the show as references to the sci fi film series have popped up throughout its run (and are collected here on the DVD in the special features area).

The Griffin family is sitting at home one night watching TV when the power goes out. To pass the time, Peter decides to tell them all the story of Star Wars, albeit his version, not the correct one. Each of the family members as well as supporting cast members takes on a different role. For instance young Chris is Luke, Peter Han Solo, Lois is Leia and so on. Funniest by far is young Stewie who appears decked out as Darth Vader, even though he stands no more than 18 inches high.

The film follows the main plot of the original STAR WARS film, the first one that came out not the first one in order. Everything from the Jawas to the sand people to the death star is here. One interesting scene that begs for the pause button is the cantina sequence. See how many characters from other series of films you note in the bar.

The usual off the wall humor of the series is here in spades. Everything from references to things that could have been different (a FAMILY GUY staple) to Han/Peter attempting to load a sofa into the Millennium Falcon.

The DVD also features some hilarious voice cameos, in particular Rush Limbaugh as Rush in the future. His rant about Lando Calrissian taking command of the cloud city due to affirmative action is hilarious.

Special Features on this disc include a rare interview with George Lucas conducted by FAMILY GUY creator Seth McFarlane. The fan boy comes out in Seth as he speaks to his idol. And Lucas shows a fan side of his own for the FAMILY GUY series. Also included are exclusive DVD material, a teaser for the next STAR WARS spoof and more.

For the truly fanatical you can find a special edition of this disc that includes such items as trading cards, a brochure, T-shirt, 3-D fight scene and more.

While animated, this DVD is not necessarily one to recommend to smaller children. But teens and adults will both find something to laugh at here. Let's hope that the do indeed make a sequel. With the number of STAR WARS films out there it only seems fitting.",1200700800,2,2820,4.420038535645472
3268492,4,B000YOX3HE,"I saw this on TV, and when the DVD came out with the commentary material, I decided to get it (had a left over gift card from December that I had to blow).

A lot of the 1-star reviews are based purely on price, and I think that's unfortunate.  $13.00 - $16.00 isn't cheap for 48 minutes of animation, but it's not a ripoff either.  The DVD is one episode, but it is also double the length of a regular 24 minute episode.  Fans of anime have been paying worse prices for years:)

Why not five stars?  Because this isn't an epic must-buy in my book.  It is a slightly over-priced guilty indulgence that is worth taking if you like smart spoofs and Star Wars.",1200614400,,657,4.208
3268493,3,B000YOX3HE,"For the record, this 2 episode series is really funny. As a family guy fan and a star wars fan, I found this to be way better, honestly, than I anticipated. However, is it worth $12? Well it certainly isn't worth any more than that. After all, it is only 42 minutes altogether! But the amazon sales price right now is exceptional; over at Wal Mart the same thing is going for $20. It really just depends on how badly you want to see this and if you really think you will be watching it more than once.",1200614400,,501,4.122448979591836

3268495,5,B000YOX3HE,"This parody is perfect. Everything fans of Family Guy & Star Wars could want is here. I won't take up time with a synopsis, and if you don't like the price then shut up and don't buy it. It's hilarious, and the special features are great. I am talking about the $12.99 version. You still get all the comentaries, featurettes, and Seth MacFarlane's interview with George Lucas. If your like me and you enjoy good special features almost as much as the main content, you will not be disappointed. The episode runs 48 min. and there are about 45 min. of special features. NEWS FLASH FOLKS, that's just as much runtime as many feature films that don't even include a theatrical preview on the DVD, and they still retail for $12 to $15. Anyway, if your reading these reviews this DVD may not really be for you, because anyone who is a Family Guy & a Star Wars fan would certainly buy this without thinking about it, and they would inevitably be very pleased.
P.S. Don't miss the hidden Easter Egg! If you go to the ""chapter select"" menu there is a picture of Herbert/Obi Wan powering down the tractor beam. When you select it you get to see a little bit of the cast doing the table read for the ""Empire Strikes Back"" episode which is now in production. That's right, they're going to do ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" as well.",1200614400,,1310,4.439834024896266
3268496,3,B000YOX3HE,"This is a must for Family Guy and Star Wars fans.  My only complaint is that it is entirely too short. Coming in at a scant 45 minutes, it's barely longer than an actual episode of Family Guy. That being said, the usual Family Guy humor is alive and well in this DVD. I would advise buying the non-special edition: the extras (t-shirt, collectables, etc) aren't impressive (unless you happen to wear an XL-tee and actually want to wear an XL tee with Family Guy on it - then go for it).

The extras aren't very good, either - commentary is pretty good, but the rest (including an awkward and tense interview with George lucas) are fairly boring.",1200614400,6,645,4.4576271186440675
3268497,5,B000YOX3HE,"WOW! What a treat for both the fans of Star Wars and Family Guy. I can remember when they aired this hilarious tribute episode a few months ago, I said to my fiancee they better put this one out solo on DVD and that it would be great if they gave it a bells and whistles collectors edition release. Well fans in this humble reviewers opinion they surpassed my expectations. The XL t-shirt is worth the extra few bucks alone. I couldn't be more happier with what I got here for $25-$30. This special collectors edition is loaded with special treats for us fans that you can find out more about here at amazon. I'm so glad that the t-shirt came in a larger size because everyone knows(or should know) that it's much easier for a smaller person to deal with a larger size than the other way around.

I gave it 2 stars because you are really buying the t-shirt, and I have to admit the t-shirt is kind of awesome, except that it makes others in the know aware i overpaid for a lame episode of family guy.

3268510,5,B000YOX3HE,"What can I say? This is without a doubt one of the best parodies ever made. As a fan of both Family guy and Star wars, I thoughouly enjoyed it. As others have stated, it is a near scene by scene parody of episode 4. The humor is top notch, but what really threw me was the original soundtrack (perfectly sync'd) and the attention to detail. For example, the opening scene was animated EXACTLY as it played out in the film. Also, little things  such as when the Millenium Falcon jumps into hyperspace and all the stars rotate clockwise around the ship. They even included one of the things that always bothered me about the original movie... when the X-wing fighters start the first attack run on the Deathstar and the three ships flip over. The last ship was flying slightly askew and the animators picked right up on it. They didn't seem to miss a thing as far as recreating each scene flawlessly.
And when it came to calling George Lucas on some of the things that did not make sense in the movie, they had me in stitches. Such as Chris (Luke) pointing out to Han that a Parsec is a unit of distance and not time. And I almost fell off the couch when they all boarded the Deathstar elevator and a Muzak version of the music for the particular scene was playing on the intercom.
Anyway, I could go on and on. Suffice it to say, this episode is a MUST SEE. There are also two scenes incuded that were not in the Television release.",1200528000,3,1431,4.319702602230484
3268511,1,B000YOX3HE,"I am not buying this Dvd. It's sad to say that, because I'd love to own it, but I refuse to buy into Fox mocking the fans. LET'S FACE IT, the only reason the show came back was because they were making so much money off of the seasons already released. So, they bring back the show and pump out episodes. Volume 3 had what, like 14 episodes max? Anyways, combine that with releasing half of a season (Volume 5), releasing ONE episode for $15, and the ""Family Guy Movie"" which was 3 episodes (also aired as the season finale last year)... AUGH! Enough is enough already! I'm a Famly Guy fan but I'm not buying into it anymore--- and I'm a DVD COLLECTOR! I buy random dvd's all of the time, I own tons and tons of movies, I cannot buy movies without having all seasons or sets. The fact that I won't buy this is saying a lot.

3268512,5,B000YOX3HE,"There has long been a close tie between ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Wars,"" probably because the comedic dimwit geniuses who supply the laughs for ""Family Guy"" were the same geeky nerds dressing up as Stormtroopers at the sci-fi functions.  Not to put down these groups of people--God knows they came together and created one of the funniest shows on television.

""Blue Harvest"" is delightful, plain and simple.  It highlights ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" (as Peter Griffin says in the beginning segment: ""This is the story of 'Star Wars.'  Let's start with Episode 4"").  Here's the cast, and my apologies if I get some of the ""Star Wars"" names wrong: Chris Griffin as Luke Skywalker; Lois as Princess Leia; Peter as Han Solo; Brian as Chewbacca; Old Man Herbert as Obi Won Kanobi; Quagmire as C-3P0; and Cleveland as R2-D2.  No use outlining the plot; you probably know it.

The episode is hilarious.  Is it worth the money?  Well, I bought it.  I will admit, the marketing behind ""Family Guy"" has been rather shrewd as of late; releasing half a season for the price of a whole one; releasing this 48-minute episode for the price of a full-length movie; dear God, they're getting their money's worth!  But, hey, we continue to buy it.  Why?  Because we love this show.  ""Family Guy"" is not the most original thing out there, and it's not the smartest thing out there; but it's certainly one of the funniest.  And whether they're lampooning Sunday-afternoon golf, to honoring great comedic moments like Leslie Nielsen's cameo in ""Airplane"" (since I am a huge Nielsen fan, this latter provides my favorite moment of ""Blue Harvest""), the creators of ""Family Guy"" are making us laugh are butts off.  Don't spend the money if you don't want to--but I would.  In this day and age, we all need a good chuckle or two.  ""Blue Harvest"" is just as good a place to go for a laugh as any--and better than most.",1200441600,9,1898,4.648648648648648
3268513,4,B000YOX3HE,"Seth McFarlane is, clearly, a geek. I for one am quite happy about this. What other TV show is there with so many hilarious references to things like ""Speed Racer"", ""Star Trek"" and, of course, ""Star Wars""?

According to the commentary on this DVD, the show did so many SW spoofs they were told by the Legal Department they needed to knock it off or Lucasfilm might have grounds for action against them. Rather than stop, McFarlane and friends went to George Lucas and got permission to do a full hour-long episode.

The result? ""Blue Harvest"".

Not only is this a hilarious ""Star Wars"" spoof, but we also get references to things like ""American Dad"", ""Airplane!"", ""Doctor Who"", ""Robot Chicken"", the Wilhelm Scream, the pointless contents of gift-baskets and why repairing a Y-wing engine can  be risky.

There's some dead-on parody of various elements in SW, like the illogic of stormtroopers noticing that a door is locked and ignoring it, and the fact that parsecs are a measurement of distance not time. On the plus side, Han/Peter DOES shoot first, so there ya go.

Really my only real criticism of the episode is that it is, if anything, too short. But what there is of it is really good.

This collector's edition DVD set is really nice. In addition to the episode (with footage not shown on TV), you get tons of extras, including commentary and a fun interview with George Lucas! Plus, hey, trading cards and a t-shirt. The shirt is, of course, XL. Never it let it be said they don't know their fan-base.

If you like ""Family Guy"" and ""Star Wars"", buy this. If you don't, you'll sink into a cesspit of self-loathing and hatred that you'll never work your way out of... well, ok, possibly not.

- the shirt only comes in ""XL"", which you only find out when you've already purchased the DVD and opened it. We are not all as big as Peter Griffin you know. I wear ""M"" and wouldn't have made a big deal if it was at least ""L"".

- the 3D scene... what 3D?!! it looks the same with or without the glasses. The only thing I was able to see with the glasses was the image formed when putting together all the cards.

3268515,4,B000YOX3HE,"As is stated repeatedly on the Commentary Track, there was no Rotoscoping of the original film by the Family Guy artist team.  They hand-drew or computer-generated everything themselves, though you would SWEAR they painted over cells of the original film!  The artwork of the Millennium Falcon and the Imperial Star Destroyers (is that one word or two?)as they fly through space is just too good to be believed.

As for the jokes, not all are slam-dunks but there are far more hits than misses.  The only segment that brought things to a screeching halt was the ""Dirty Dancing"" musical number.

There are a few clever jokes that poke fun at the original movie's lapses in logic.  The ending is a bit abrupt, but maybe we can chalk that up to the fact that FG already did the Throne Room Medal Ceremony scene (the final scene in ""Star Wars"") in an earlier episode of the TV series.  They already used up the best ending.

I bought the collector's edition.  The bonus goodies are kinda neat so long as you buy the thing at a sale price.

The collector's edition includes a pair of 3-D glasses to watch a 3-D bonus segment following the escape from the Death Star, but the effect doesn't really work that well.

The set also includes a second disc that lets you download the entire episode to your PC or iPod.  I don't know if that is exclusive to the Collector's edition or if it comes with the standard edition too.

Collector's edition comes with a T-shirt too, but being a man of Peter Griffin-esque girth, it simply ain't gonna fit me.",1200441600,17,1537,4.545454545454546

This episode stands out as one of my favorites...clever, funny and great animation. I will admit, I am guilty of buying this DVD falling into the trap that Fox has laid out. The more I think about it the more mad I get at the way they are releasing DVD's for both THE FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD. It really shows how greedy they are and it is not good for the consumer. These are two of my favorite series on TV and I do have all of the DVDs. The problem I am now having is that they are not releasing full seasons on these box sets...and they are doing this for no other reason than to make more money. The creators of these shows should be appreciative of the fact that they have such a loyal fan base. If they didn't THE FAMILY GUY would never have been brought back. How do they repay us? By releasing DVD sets with half a season on each for the same price that other companies are releasing full seasons on DVD for! C'mon guys...wise up. Both shows are shown in repeat on multiple channels almost daily and pretty much everyone owns either a VCR or DVD recorder so taping these shows is not a problem. I myself prefer the DVD quality that you don't always get, even with an HD broadcast, but its getting to the point where I can't afford to continue buying these sets, especially when they are incomplete. I do recommend this episode to all fans of both THE FAMILY GUY and STAR WARS and I do think the deluxe set with the little bonuses is worth the price but at the rate Fox is going I doubt I will be buying any more boxed sets of half seasons.",1200355200,,1679,4.137614678899083

3268518,1,B000YOX3HE,"I tend to like the Family Guy, but this episode is devoid of originality or humor, no matter what your opinion on the pricing is.

They had under an hour to satirize the bible of sci-fi mythology, and the best they could do was a Grey Pupon joke?  How about the fact about 15% of the running time is animated versions of the spaceship scenes in the film.  There are a few witty exceptions, but for the most part, it's like watching a cartoon version of Star Wars establishing shots.  It's the laziest writing I've ever seen on this show.  The special documentary makes it sound like such an event.  But when you literally spend an entire minute playing the muzak version of the Empire Theme in its entirety, you're not making it funny by making it longer, your beating a dead horse (and burning up time you weren't creative enough to work another joke in).  You can't tell me it would have been any LESS funny if we just heard the opening bars of the song.  That way there's time for another, better gag.  And can someone explain the Italian guys on Tatooine?  What a waste of time THAT pointless ethic stereotype gag was... That made eyes roll back in the 80s!!!

Sure, it's lazy a lot of the time just like the South Park guys pointed out in the Cartoon Wars episodes, but I still enjoy the show. And I always look forward to seeing a new episode on TV or a new DVD coming out.

This was no exception. And keep in mind, I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid. So, today I bought the Blue Harvest special edition.

It has a couple of decent extra items. A book on the art of making the movie, cards, 3-D glasses, a shirt... nothing amazing, but okay stuff.

In retrospect, I wish it had come with a rape whistle so that I might have alerted others to the fact that I was buying this hackneyed phoned-in garbage and gotten help instead of having to spend the night curled up in a ball at the bottom of my shower whimpering, ""they didn't even try to be funny. They just remade the movie with their characters, threw in a couple of gags, and thought that was enough. That wasn't a spoof. That was garbage. Spaceballs is a spoof.

I knew this was different then just the regular episodes, and like so many others, I tuned in and was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the storyline similar and different to the actual movies, it also had its own subtleties that made it unique to the way only Family Guy could do it. The movie is based on ""A New Hope"" (the one that came out in 1977), launching a generation of Star Wars loyalists. Everyone gets a part, and I love Stewie as Darth. It was a perfect fit as he tries yet again to conquer the world.

You can get either the regular DVD or the special edition pack. I am not really sure what's in the regular DVD, but I just bought the special edition at a store today and you get everything. Obviously, the biggest reason you would get the special edition version is because of the shirt. I love it. The details and colors are amazing. What's funny is, it looks like C-3PO/Quagmire is asking R2-D2/Cleveland about his sister's lesbot.

Additional goodies that you get are the baseball style cards, where one side you can put together and its a jigsaw puzzle (I won't spoil it for you), the 3-D glasses so you can watch the fight scene in 3-D. The 19 page booklet is included with sketches and storyboard. Another great feature is that Disc 2 includes the movie where you can transfer it to computer, video iPod, iPhone, and other portable media players. What that means is you can watch the movie on your iPhone, Zune, etc. The final piece is the box. Its actually a great finish piece that puts everything into place neatly and you can even use it as a centerpiece display to show off.

It's worth it. I don't think it's a rip-off like other people claim. You get a lot for 25 dollars, and I am happy and I know that this is something I will enjoy for a really long time. Freakin' Sweet.",1200355200,19,1946,4.34065934065934

In my opinion this is the greatest Family Guy episode that has ever been made, and that is a very bold statement for anyone who is a huge Family Guy fan like I am. The source material was already strong, and all the other outside references that we are accustomed to just made it better (my favorite was the Dr. Who reference in Hyperspace.)

Just as a reminder, you do not JUST get the episode. You get some added DVD features like behind the scenes stuff, commentary tracks (Which are always great from these guys) and I believe a preview of the next Star Wars parody episode.

One could argue, ""Well, they should just put this in the regular Seasonal DVD Set."" That may be true, but on the other end, what if you don't feel like waiting for that, or if you don't feel like paying for the whole season when you just want to have this particular episode?

Instead of viewing this as a rip-off on this idea that you HAVE to buy this DVD, instead view it as a ""Gift"" by Fox in that now you can OWN this memorable and great episode. No one is forcing you to buy it, and it is an extremely funny episode that any fan of Family Guy, Star Wars, or even parody can enjoy. If for nothing besides anecdotal purposes, instead of describing to your friends how funny this episode was and having to reference everything by memory, NOW you can actually show them!",1200268800,3,1519,4.263888888888889
3268537,2,B000YOX3HE,"The uproar of the fans. The ratings on Cartoon Network. Was it not we the fans that brought this show back from extinction and then allowed Seth to not only get Family Guy back but create drivel like American Dad? And this is how we are repaid with a $13 two-episode disc or a $25 ""special edition?""

Can't help but think greed, greed, greed here. But when Lucas gave his blessing for an episode like this to happen you had to know the marketing wheels were rolling in his head, thus here we are at 48 minutes for either 13 or 25 bucks.

As for the episode itself, it was great for the most part. It has the awful let's-see-how-long-we-can-drag-it-out jokes that unfortunately Family Guy has relied on since its return. But for a fan of both Family Guy (pre-drag out jokes as long as we can) and Star Wars this is an enjoyable show.",1200182400,4,832,4.361290322580645
3268538,3,B000YOX3HE,"I agree that it's quite ridiculous to charge this much for one episode. And from what little extra features seems to be on the disk, there's little incentive to but it for such reason (not that that's a good reason to buy a DVD) Although, being the Family Guy / Star Wars geek that I am, I'd love to see that preview. And for $12 more the limited edition has a nice sized package of the typical ephemera the likes of me have come to expect from the corporate gods. If I had more money to throw away, AND I hadn't burnt the DVD of the episode by itself off my Tivo, I may have actually considered getting that limited edition. What studios like these have yet to come to terms with is that such gimmicks like this are (or at least should be) falling by the wayside due to the ease of obtaining the true meat of these items for free (and legally, I might add, there's no law or company that's trying to stop me from burning decent quality DVR recordings to DVD for my own private use). The only way they can expect to move such items is to include more for less. Otherwise, the majority of your target market is savvy, intelligent and cheap, and will continue to develop said technologies faster than corporate America can implement countermeasures.

All that aside, it's an amazing episode. I would imagine any Family Guy or Star Wars fan would thoroughly enjoy it. And (from Wikipedia): ""This episode drew 10.7 million viewers, and earned the highest Nielsen rating of any Family Guy episode since the show returned to air in 2005, making it the second most-watched episode in the series behind 'North by North Quahog' which garnered 11.9 million."" If money is no object and you don't mind indulging the studios, by all means do so. There are far worse places your money can be wasted in today's world.",1200009600,13,1802,4.477203647416413
3268549,1,B000YOX3HE,"It's getting to be a bit much at this point. First they separate the last season into two DVD sets to get more money out of fans. Now they are charging this much for one episode! If they don't want to put it in the next box set, if fans don't wait until then or if someone only wants this one episode, they could at least offer it on iTunes for the standard episode fee. This is getting ridiculous. I am not paying for this and I seriously doubt that I will buy the next set. I'll just watch the reruns that are on at least 3 different channels rather than give in to their greed. I suggest others do the same and send a message.

If they really wanted to offer the fans something worthwhile and worth the money, they should have only released this version, with all the extras (the shirt, cards, etc.), at the price they are charging for the regular version with the episode only.  Other than that, this is just greed.  I don't know if it is the studio or Seth, but either way, we shouldn't stand for it.  My guess is it's the studio, so if people don't pay the high prices for low value Seth would be able stand up to them a bit more.",1200009600,42,1136,4.103603603603603
3268550,4,B000YOX3HE,"As both a die-hard Family Guy and Star Wars fan, I was thrilled when I heard about this double episode, and really enjoyed it when it aired on FOX.  I taped it while watching, but have since lost that copy so am glad they were so quick to release it on DVD.

If you just want the this for the epsisode alone, then I suggest buying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy-Blue-Harvest/dp/B000YOX3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy - Blue Harvest</a>&nbsp;-- the bare bones DVD.  Granted, the price is still a bit steep for just 2 episodes, but to be fair they pack it with a ton of special features and a a bonus disc with a ""portable digital copy of Blue Harvest"" that's compatible with iTunes & Windows Media Players.

But with the Special Edition, you get  much more, and as a collector and fan, that is what really appeals to me.  Just read the Product Description for the full list.  As for the actual show, fans of either franchise will probably find a lot to like.  Though it is a spoof, it remains very faithful to the original Episode IV in many respects.  The humor was great, though the some of the parts dragged a little.  The couch in the trash compactor bit was funny, but it seemed to go on bit long.  The musical numbers didn't add much for me, and I was not overly thrilled at the use of the old pedefile as Obi Wan. It seem innapropriate somehow.  For those little niggles I dropped a star.

Overall though, a fun and worthwhile package for Star Wars and Family Guy fans everywhere!
Just one other niggle -- Amazon dropped the price to just below $25 so it does not qualify for Super Saver Shipping.  Not cool guys.",1200009600,35,1684,4.703071672354949
3268551,2,B000YOX3HE,"I just can not get into Family Guy... I was happen when it returned after having been canceled for 2 or 3 years... but the quality has just lowered. Aside from having little to no plot anymore, the jokes are just redundant at this point. How many times do you watch an episode and hear ""Remember the time when..."" and based on the context and the direction the show normally takes you know the gist of what is going to happen in the upcoming joke.

I think my biggest problem with the show now is the fact that they seem to be playing off their own popularity. The first seasons before they were canceled, there were many characters introduced as one-time jokes, as I would consider them. Based on the current situation of the episode, certain characters came into play... and yes they were funny initially... but now since they were so popular among fans they keep being brought back. These include: Ali (news caster), pirate with wooden arms & legs, greased up deaf guy, Herbert (old guy who likes Chris), the chicken (fight), etc. Now in many shows, such as Simpsons, there are several characters that are there in one or two episodes a season only, and you may ask what the difference is. The characters in shows such as Simpsons are well-defined and many of which given depth. Nearly none of them (exception being the Cat Lady for example) are plagued by stereotypical jokes for that character. These reoccurring characters in Family Guy are very shallow and their jokes are redundant to the point where I find it nauseating... anytime you see one, you know exactly what jokes will occur again based on the context and the fact that these characters only will make the same style of joke/gag. Same goes for the chicken fight for example... hilarious... after the 3rd or 4th time (I forget)... it is just old at this point... come up with something original.

My point being... Blue Harvest was nothing new for me. I felt like I had already watched it. I mean, honestly, when Herbert entered in the episode and you saw the light saber... who here can honestly say they didn't see an erection joke coming?",1199923200,11,2108,4.618666666666667

If it came with other episodes or maybe was ,at the very least, half the price they're asking it might be reasonable. But I agree with everybody else, Fox is ripping is us off on DVDs. Don't encourage them to do so, pirate until the prices get reasonable. Not that I'm encouraging people to pirate...",1199923200,21,413,4.447368421052632
3268553,5,B000YOX3HE,"As for this episode - it was truly spectacular. Much better than the hourlong straight to DVD Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.

My only issue with Family Guy is that while FOX broadcasts the show in HD they have yet to release any of the latest seasons on Blu-Ray. Even though Family Guy is a cartoon there is still a real difference if you flip between regular cable and the HD station while watching. The colors are more vibrant and the lines are less fuzzy.

Still, this was a great episode and well worth owning on DVD until FOX starts releasing more Blu-Rays.",1199836800,2,565,4.475728155339806

It's nice to see Family Guy with not so many non-sequitars and more straight story (although it's not original.) Using Chris as the main character of a double length episode is kind odd since he normally doesn't get much air time in normal episodes.

You definitely have to be a big Star Wars fan AND Family Guy fan to find this funny...but if you are both you are in for a treat. The only thing I would change about this is that I think Adam West would have been a better Obi Wan Kenobi and was wasted in the role of Governor Tarkin.

This does include some good special features which makes it unnecessary to get the collector's set unless you are really that hardcore of a fan...and want to pay twice as much.",1199750400,,837,4.393548387096774
