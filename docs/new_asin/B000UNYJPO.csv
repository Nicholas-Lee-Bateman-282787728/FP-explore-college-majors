8213911,3,B000UNYJPO,"ESPN's 3-part Honor Roll detailing all the great moments in college football is strong on the more recent gridiron accomplishments, but somewhat lacking on a deeper historical perspective. Reece Davis does a fine job narrating and coming from the college football Hall of Fame in Notre Dame was a nice twist. I just think ""Rites of Autumn"" does a better job chronicling the complete history of this grand game.",1343347200,2,410,4.956521739130435
8213912,3,B000UNYJPO,"If you believe that the overwhelming majority of the greatest events, players, coaches, etc. of college football have occurred in the past 30 years, then I suppose this set is not too bad. If you believe that the prior hundred years might also have been important, then you should look elsewhere. ""Rites of Autumn"" is a much, much better set on the same subject. It is more professionally done and has a much better historical perspective.

It seems to me that this DVD set's choices of what was ""great"" was driven primarily by ease of obtaining film clips and sound bites.",1232755200,3,573,4.673267326732673
