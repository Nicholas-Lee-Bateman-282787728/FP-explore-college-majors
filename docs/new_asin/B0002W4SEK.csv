8033561,4,B0002W4SEK,"I can't believe I found this on DVD! I recorded this off tv with VHS tape years ago. We play it only once or twice a year, because the tape is slowly  wearing out.

The story is really interesting. There are bits of homey charm with the main character at home or training her dogs, or talking to her friends. Then there are the scenes of suspense or action, chasing the serial killer. And what a serial killer!

[SPOILER AHEAD]

A guy so cold he kills children as revenge on the adults.

Fortunately, this isn't a gory movie. But I thought it was well done. In fact, when I first saw it, I thought it was a mystery tv show pilot. But at least, we have this one story. If it's really based on actual events, that is incredibly sad.

But now it's on DVD! Thanks Amazon!",1456272000,,767,4.183673469387755
8033562,1,B0002W4SEK,"This movie was bland. I think most of these results reviews are fake. The story/acting isn't good. The only highlight of this movie are the well trained rescue dogs. Perhaps kids, animal lovers, and folks with a limited movie catalog may like this movie. I wish I didn't sit through it because in my opinion, it wasn't good.",1432425600,,324,4.603448275862069

8033566,5,B0002W4SEK,"This is a good lite weight mystery.  I like the actress, Sherilyn Fenn.  I've watched her before and liked most of her work.  Loved the dogs used.  It played out completely, so the store rates high with me.  Loved watching it without commercials.",1392508800,,246,4.627906976744186
8033567,4,B0002W4SEK,I too was pleasantly surprised at how well done this movie is.  Kept my interest `til the end. Not gory either.,1375056000,,111,4.285714285714286
8033568,4,B0002W4SEK,"I was surprised at how good this movie was. I purchased it without knowing anything about it.  This movie actually deserves more than 4 stars, but not quite 5 stars.  Sherilyn Fenn gives one of her better performances as a dog handler, relying on her acting ability rather than on her sex appeal which is played down.

The movie is well written and directed and for a little known movie provides a lot of entertainment for the buck.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys thrillers or mysteries or who is a fan of Sherilyn Fenn.",1352592000,,532,4.453608247422681
