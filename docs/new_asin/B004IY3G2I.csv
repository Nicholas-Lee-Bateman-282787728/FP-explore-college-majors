5157652,4,B004IY3G2I,Interesting film and dangerous knowledge. Watch out using ibogaine for artificial substance withdrawal. Seems like it does work for heroine. It will be completely illegal soon.,1397260800,,176,5.8076923076923075
5157653,4,B004IY3G2I,"Honestly, this documentary did keep me interested.  It did get kinda wiggy with the African voodoo part.  I did feel the principal of the story was believable, but why is this ""drug"" still undercover if it indeed helps recovery for the addict?  God knows America and elsewhere needs this ""drug"" to help with drug addiction.  It has been written that there is a cure for all the ills we suffer in plants, if we just knew how to select and process the plant medicinally.",1397174400,3,468,4.535714285714286
5157654,5,B004IY3G2I,"Less of a documentary on ibogaine, more of a character study of one man, yet this film manages to teach and inspire.  A pleasure, I have watched it several times and caught something new each go round.  Both the film maker and the subject have much to be proud of.",1305417600,6,264,4.26
5157655,5,B004IY3G2I,"This film not only further informed me of an incredible natural medicine to treat drugs addicts (Iboga) but yanked at my heart, shocked and kept me as breathless as the main character. It is impossible to not fall for Dimitri's wild journey from the streets of NY to the West African jungle, as he helps addicts one by one, as he was once helped. You have to see it.",1303776000,9,366,4.318840579710145
5157656,5,B004IY3G2I,"IDWL has much to say about the lack of genuine ""treatment"" for hardcore addictions. A typical ""rehab"" for a junkie or crack user is nothing but a place to be ill while you wait to get back out to the street. Rehabs fail to provide the foundational shift that results in a chance at problematic drug use cessation.
Ibogaine, the real star of this documentary, actually gives addicts a chance by interrupting their cravings and keeping them from withdrawal. But it's a Schedule I substance, with the same legal status as the drugs it is used to treat. And the scheduling also indicates that ibogaine is ""prone to abuse"" and ""has no medicinal application""---neither claim will be believed by any casual observer of this film.
IDWL represents a great opportunity to spread the word about ibogaine. Sure, it's a study of a charismatic front-man who advocates and risks himself for the promotion of the medicine. But its' real impact is on the bottom line of how we can deal with addictions, and a compassionate way to work with addicts.
Disclosure, author is an iboga therapist.",1303776000,14,1073,4.805405405405406
5157657,5,B004IY3G2I,"This movie has something for everybody - love, chaos, adventure, danger, trouble, victory... Dimitri's example makes the cost of the American Dream apparent as he shows how much good one person can do right where he is. His compelling example puts the laws of love before the laws of men, where they belong. Dimitri sets an original example of a model citizen as he claims the ""land of the free and home of the brave"" with passionate effort. Anyone with a loved one who is facing the perils of addiction will also want to watch this movie for the solutions it reveals, especially with the unique addiction interrupting drug ibogaine from the African iboga shrub.",1303776000,9,662,4.765217391304348

8527280,5,B004IY3G2I,"In this documentary, emotions and reality cross paths multiple times.  I am very happy to have people out there researching real cures, while going back to the basic fundamental facts of being human and spiritual in one vessel.  This would be a very good homeopathic cure, and I hope the government powers that be will some day realize the two walk hand in hand.",1456444800,,362,4.640625
8527281,5,B004IY3G2I,Very original. Interesting character study and information about this potentially helpful treatment for addiction.,1452988800,,114,7.214285714285714

When the powers that be are finally tossed from their ivory towers, we will all be able to enjoy our true nature devoid of big pharma and filled with nature's delights. Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, and Marijuana will be able to teach without constraints. About time.",1415750400,2,276,5.021739130434782

8527287,5,B004IY3G2I,This was a very in depth look at a lifestyle that much of society doesn't comprehend. It is even more so about human beings so desperate to escape this deadly lifestyle they will go to yet another extreme for a chance to leave this demon called addiction. Very bold & enlightening film!,1398038400,2,286,4.519230769230769
