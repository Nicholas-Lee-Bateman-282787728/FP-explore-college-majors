Path: Tim Keesee takes you through Southeast Asia to see where God is at work. You will not see mega churches being formed with thousands coming to Christ. You will not see professions of faith followed by lives of ease. You will not see the prosperity gospel. What you will see is committed believers taking the love of Christ to the sick, neglected, abused, and forgotten.

Sources: This is basically a video journal. The viewer is led through a several week trip to Southeast Asia, narrated by Tim Keesee. The videography is well done. The message is powerful.

Agreement: I appreciated their time spent on individual ministers and families. I also appreciated the balance between bringing them a message, and loving them like Christ. At times they need to just create a presence before they are able to start a church. Pulling back the curtains on the sex trafficking was especially difficult to process.

8525099,5,B0084FPTIQ,"If you are longing to see that God is powerfully at work all over the world, the ""Dispatches from the Front"" series will not disappoint!  These documentaries tell amazing stories of transforming grace. The oppressed are set free, the broken are made whole, those who hunger and thirst are satisfied, the blind are given new sight, the orphaned are adopted, and the disheartened are given hope.  Believers will walk away encouraged and challenged to live out the Gospel in the world around them.",1339027200,2,494,4.9397590361445785
