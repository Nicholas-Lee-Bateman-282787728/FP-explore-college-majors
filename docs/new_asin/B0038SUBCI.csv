4092254,5,B0038SUBCI,I took a chance and bought this video without even knowing Kelly.  I was soooo pleasantly surprised.  It is short (30 min) but she cues well and the intesity is great.  I sweat every time.  Love her attitude through the whole video.  I just ordered another one and I am confident I will love it too.,1358121600,,299,4.267857142857143
4092255,5,B0038SUBCI,She packs alot into 30 minutes be ready. I always feel like I have completed a workout after these dvd's,1356048000,,104,4.25
4092256,5,B0038SUBCI,"I accidentally stumbled on to Kelly Coffey and I'm so glad that I did!  She has the best intermediate workouts that I can find.  This one is my favorite cardio workout that I have.  I usually do a premix - the plyo segments mixed in with the step and I'm sweating buckets by the end.  I found this workout to be tough but doable without the dread factor.

Kelly's cuing is good.  The choreography isn't too difficult or dancy.  There's enough intensity that I feel like I worked hard... but it's not impossible for me (like a Cathe video).  The segments are short enough that it doesn't feel repetitive.  Kelly is so likeable and enthusiastic without being annoying.  It's just really, really good.

I moved away from the Firm to Kelly after I discovered her.  I find her workouts more effective and fun.",1342310400,4,804,4.545454545454546
4092257,4,B0038SUBCI,It's a good mix to have in the DVD workout library.  I like the step portion but the breaks are too long in the dedicated plyo section.  If you do the part that is a mix of step and plyo it's better.,1308182400,4,199,3.7142857142857144
4092258,4,B0038SUBCI,As an advanced fitness fanatic I love Kelley for her kick-ass workouts and this one doesn't disappoint. I love the option in the premixes to do the atheltic step combos with the plyo sections in between for a 50 min workout! It also contains a lot of strength moves which is great becauseyou are working your legs at the same time!,1282694400,6,331,4.442622950819672
8391763,5,B0038SUBCI,"Kelly is the best!  She is feisty and funny.  She pushes you to work hard, but isn't in your face about it.  I don't get annoyed watching her like all the rest of the fitness people.  And there are pre-mixes so you never get bored with a workout and you can target what muscles you want, when you want.  Love, love, love!  I've never seen one of her videos that I didn't absolutely adore and follow.",1502841600,,399,4.184210526315789

8391765,4,B0038SUBCI,"Kelly Coffey workouts are good.  She's a bit boring to listen to, but her moves are pretty good and a solid workout",1482883200,,115,4.2272727272727275
8391766,3,B0038SUBCI,Not one of my favorite Kelly Coffey-Meyer DVD's.  My knees tend to ache afterwards.,1471737600,,83,4.928571428571429
8391767,5,B0038SUBCI,"This is a great step video.  She has become my favorite video instructor.  I have bought many of her videos, but her step boxing and kickboxing are definitely my favorite.  I haven't tried the plyomeyrics on this video, but love the step aerobics.",1461974400,,247,4.6976744186046515
8391768,5,B0038SUBCI,"I don't have a lot of time so this DVD is for me. There are two workouts, non-dance step & plyometrics, both are very good and gets your heart pumping. This is my first Kelly Coffey workout. She is great at cuing and a very likable person. No screaming, in your face nonsense. There are two levels to each workout. The women look like real women, no models who look like they need cookie or could be mistaken for a man because they have so many muscles. The music is great, too.",1399420800,2,478,4.206521739130435
8391769,5,B0038SUBCI,"It's hard to find good cardio step routines.  This one is awesome.  It's easy to follow and fun while working up a sweat.  I like the plyo exercises too, but the step routines are my favorite.",1395187200,2,192,4.277777777777778
8391770,4,B0038SUBCI,"Kelly Coffey-Meyer is one of my favorite fitness instructors, but I tend to have more of her strength-focused DVDs than her cardio ones.  However, I enjoy plyometrics and was curious about this DVD, so I decided to give it a try.  Like all of the offerings in her ""30 Minutes to Fitness"" series, this DVD contains two workouts, each approximately 30 minutes in length (although the routines run a bit long here, which is actually one of the things I don't like).  Kelly teaches the workout live with her two usual background exercisers, Lauren and Samantha.  Lauren modifies the first workout without use of a step, and she modifies the second workout to be mostly low impact.

The Main Menu offers the following options:  Introduction - Workout One ""Athletic Step"" - Workout Two ""Plyometrics"" - Premixes - Chapters.  The Chapters Menu lists the warm-up, the five step combos, and the cool-down, for the first workout, and for the second workout, each exercise is listed individual along with the warm-up and cool-down.  I have provided additional details below.

WORKOUT #1 (36.5 minutes)
The 5-minute warm-up includes squats right-left, step and shoot, alternating knees, step/lunge back, tap on/over the step, insole taps on the step, and punches.  Kelly teaches the step combos in an add-on, ""take it from the top"" style, but once she is finished a combo, she moves on to the next one.
*Step Combo #1: Start with basic step; adds speed bag with lift back.  Next, turn step and knee with thrust punch.  Add squat moving down the step and triple insole.
*Step Combo #2: Start with a tap on/over step; add a side hop.  Perform double side hops over the step.  Add front-back step touch.
*Step Combo #3: Begin with triple knee and pulsing lunge back; add triple corner jab with jack.  Next, jog with ""shoot.""  End with side step with side kick out.
*Step Combo #4: Start with low squat v-step followed by jack.  Add knee ""charleston"" and then L-step with shuffle.  Finish with power tap with knee.
*Step Combo #5: First move is a jack followed by heel pump; add squat with punches, then hamstring curl with jack.  Pivot over step squat to finish.
The short stretch (<2 minutes) for this workout uses the step and targets the hamstrings, hip flexors, side, shoulders, inner thighs, and back.

WORKOUT #2 (35 minutes)
The long warm-up (6 minutes) for this workout includes slow side steps, knee wraps, hamstrings curls, jobs, leaps to the front/side, and squats/squats with knees.  There is also a brief round of stretches for the hip flexors, calves, and quads.  The exercises are performed in two sets of eight (really, 16 right in a row), which is then repeated once.  Here they are as listed on the chapter menu:
*Squat Jump
*Jacks Over Square (Kelly uses a folded towel)
*Hop Overs
*Tuck Jumps
*Long Jumps
*Heel Digs
*Splits on the Move
*Jump In Straddle Out
*Side Lunges
*Power Knees
The 3.5-minute aerobic cool-down incorporates jogs and marches and then repeats several of the stretches from the warm-up to finish.

There are only two Premixes on this DVD; they are Step Plyo Blast (41 mins.) and Step Plyo Blast (49 minutes).

I found both of these workouts to be just okay.  For the step routine, I definitely liked that the choreography was not too complex and that Kelly incorporated kicking and punching.  On the other hand, I thought that the combos dragged on too long, and there were WAY too many jacks for my liking (on of my least-favorite moves).  For the plyometric workout, I thought that some of the moves were a lot of fun and easy enough to modify the intensity to your own level (e.g., I like to jump, but I do smaller jumps than Kelly for the ""squat jump,"" and I love that she included lower-impact moves such as the ""heel digs"" and ""power knees"").  Despite this, I felt that there wasn't enough variety in this routine, and I just can't see using it on a regular basis.  Finally, the premixes didn't offer much variety, as they just weave the pylos into the full step combos.

As with all Kelly's DVDs, these routines are well-produced, and they are likely to appeal to intermediate exercisers.  They just did not fit with my particular needs.",1381881600,5,4168,4.737864077669903
8391771,4,B0038SUBCI,"This workout is definitely lower impact than many other CoffeyFit workouts, but it's great for a 'rest' day or for beginners. As usual, Kelley brings a fun attitude and varried moves that mean you don't get bored. And, of course, one of the best features of the 30MTF videos - this offers various pre-mixes.",1364860800,,307,4.703703703703703
8391772,5,B0038SUBCI,"There are two main workouts on this DVD. A step workout and a plyometrics workout, in addition to several premixes that you can choose for more variety.

What I love about the step routine is that it isn't dance-y at all. I'm very uncoordinated and don't have a large space in which to do my stepping, so this workout is great. She also has some boxing moves in the step routine, so you can were wrist weights to get a higher burn. If you are looking for a fun step workout, that doesn't require a lot of space or for you to be a dancer, this is the one for you. There's a modifier without a step, so if you just want to do this as aerobics, that's an option too.

The Plyometrics workout is great too! I like the fact that she gives you breaks between the exercises to catch your breath and get a quick drink of water.

So far, I have loved all of Kelly's workouts. I am certain to buy more.
