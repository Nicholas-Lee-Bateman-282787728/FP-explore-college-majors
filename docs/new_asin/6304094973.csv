781533,1,6304094973,"David Spade and Chris Farley are talent gone to waste in this lame movie about an imbecile (Farley) ruining his brother's chances of becoming governer. Although silly and predictable, Black Sheep does have a few funny moments, but no where near enough. It's not completely unbearable, but almost.",973987200,5,296,5.1875
781534,1,6304094973,"I guess there is a fine line between stupid funny and just plain stupid.  Maybe if I watch this years down the road, I'll think its stupid funny, but right now it was just plain stupid.  Tommy Boy wasn't high brow comedy, and I didn't expect that here.  I love ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" so I can appreciate stupid antics and grade school humor.  This was a remake of Tommy Boy but with the good parts gone.  If you are a huge Chris Farley fan, disregard what I say, I am sure you will love it no matter what.  If you are looking for a really funny movie and aren't a big Farley fan, then pass and move on to another movie.",970358400,4,642,4.055555555555555
781535,3,6304094973,"Chris Farley, i'll say is a comedy god, but this movie was not his best work. it could have been a lot better. it's okay, but then again it's not. now Tommy Boy, was a great movie David Spade could not have played both  these roles better. Black Sheep was kind of a dissapointment, but if your  going to get it, it's your decision, but i think you'll be more happy with  Tommy Boy.",961372800,3,381,4.121621621621622
781536,5,6304094973,"Much better story line then Tommy boy, and almost as funny.  Overall, I have to give this movie a better review than Tommy boy, considering that the story line was really lame.  I seriously recommend this movie, it will  put you on the floor!",951523200,4,242,4.454545454545454
781537,5,6304094973,"This movie is one of the best comedies I've ever seen and I've seen it a lot,and it keeps getting better each time. David Spade and Chris Farley were the Abbot and Costello of the 90's they had great chemistry and above  all else they were funny and in case you haven't guessed I also loved Tommy  Boy. These 2 were also great seperately,Spade in ""Lost and Found""  and Farley in ""Beverly Hills Ninja"" if you want to laugh,watch  these movies.",950659200,5,442,4.419753086419753

781722,1,6304094973,"I am a fan of the early 90s comedy movies so I purchased Black Sheep & Tommy Boy to fill a void in my movie collection. I have no problems with the shipping or packing but I do have a problem with the Blu Rays themselves. Black Sheep came in rough condition like it had been laying in some basement since the 90s. The cover looked dusty and had indentation and scratches to the outside. The disk looked new and played fine but when I select ""new"", I expect somewhat pristine or excellent condition. I have seen these movies on the $10 racks of target and wal-mart and decided on Amazon to save a few dollars but I am very disappointed. Not to mention Tommy Boy the movie I bought with this one came looking like a bootleg copy. That doesn't exactly make me feel comfortable with my purchase. The disk cover looked like someone just copied it shoved it in place. Again the movies arrived on time but the overall product was a HUGE let dow!",1490054400,,938,4.305084745762712

782005,4,6304094973,"Understandable why film critic Gene Siskel walked out on this moo bee.  Watching the ""Black Sheep"" brother of goofernatorial cadninut Al Donnelly was not significantly different from watching real world cadninuts wildly discriminating against the 48% of the over 18 population who are ""singles"", against wannabe heteros rejecting the homosexual regimentation in their ""schools"", and against the majority of Constitution ""protected"" human and civil rights of citizens.  For those who like such things, the movie contained major amounts of slapstick humor of the sort in which the pair of criminal gang ""political"" potties regularly engage for their ""let's pretend we're opponents"" riggings of the ""voting"" swindle system.  The concluding scenes reminded me of the sonofaBush election where 3,000 more votes were ""cast"" for that felonious abrogator of the US Constitution than there were registered voters in that precinct.  Worthy of a four star rating for its depiction of the ""political"" process.",1485129600,,997,5.582781456953643

782417,4,6304094973,"Man, this film is just beaten down for no reason. Critics needed something to savage. PRETENSION is the name of the game here. Some of these critics should be embarrassed at some of the films they rate so highly. I think one of the worst films I have EVER seen, Elysium--and mind you I don't look to watch bad films--is sitting at almost 70% on RT. Riiiiiiiight. Yet even Tommy Boy was drowned in a bunch of negative and wholly irrational reviews. Not even over 50% on that site.

The film Black Sheep was indeed rushed and appropriated because of the more masterful and successful Tommy Boy. Siskel said he walked out of the theater lol. But when you get down to it the film is just a normal slapstick comedy and it includes Farley, one of the best at his profession. He is a warm presence for me. And sometimes that is enough. Many I guess disagree, and I am not sure for what reason. For one thing I saw Siskel and his brethren rate many TERRIBLE films much higher than this, and many great films along the same lines. I don't really trust critics and never have because my own critical thinking skills are very high. If you can't laugh at any of this I wouldn't even want to know you for one. How can you be so lame as to not even admit this is funny in parts?

What I cannot agree with I guess is that this film is bad. If this film is bad then so are a whole host of other comedies highly ranked in the canon. What and the heck divides this from films like Bridesmaids? Oh, I forgot the feminist movement is in full swing and it's okay as long as it's really popular to like. But not Farley. Oh man, what did these people think of when A&C and Three Stooges were on air? Apparently that was high-brow comedy of the first order LOL. I'm going to doubt audiences all thought that kind of humor was appropriate at the time. This is NOT a film near as bad as some of Adam Sandler's worst, and nor is it a film that is great. So big deal. I had fun watching this and it was not cringe-inducing. It had a good heart and did what it set out to do within the crazy constraints placed upon it; you can read about those on Wiki.

No, this is clearly not as good as Tommy Boy, or Caddyshack, or even Happy Gilmore--one of my favorite goofy comedies--but Farley puts his all into it. For 4 dollars I see no reason not pick it up. The bluray is robust and very nicely detailed. It's a trip back into the 90s when this guy was commanding a lot of the spotlight. He was divisive for sure. But I didn't think Belushi did anything more noteworthy than Farley did. So I guess to each their own. This is more like a 3.5 star film but it never overstays its welcome. It revels in its goofiness, its fast-written and somewhat sophomoric comedy. But it's also better than a lot of stuff today because it features a comedian that is better than most of what we have today in this genre of slapstick. I recommend it. It did get some bad reviews, but there were some critics like that of the LA Times who gave it a decent rating as well. It also has a good message within its hasty script.

There are so many terrible--often melodramatic--films I turn off today not even half-way through.... I just could not do that with this one. I don't recommend Beverly Hilly Ninja or anything, but this film was clearly a cut above that kind of drek. I always find it so hilarious that people compare Farley as a lightweight to Belushi and Candy. Well, Belushi was nothing more than a lightweight to Candy if you ask me. Few comedians did a film great as Plains, Trains, and Automobiles. Belushi did not carry films either IMO. And none of the three were really great Hollywood actors. To heck with the pretentiousness. This film was a good, fine romp with a few drinks. I was laughing more than I should admit I guess. Props for a good soundtrack with Mudhoney and B.

783596,5,6304094973,"As the title of this review suggests, this is a vintage Chris Farley and David Spade movie.  These two worked together very well as a comedy team and it shows in this movie.  While this movie shares a remarkably large amount of its content with ""Tommy Boy"", one cannot be too surprised because this is the type of humor that existed back when this was released.

Because this is the type of humor I enjoyed back in the 90s and even through today, this movie holds a special appeal to me.  Not everyone is going to like this type of movie as it is filled with Chris Farley yelling a lot and David Spade dealing with one blunder after another from Farley's character.  The reason I give this 5 stars is simply because, for a comedy at its time, it stands out and is very easily remembered.

If you are looking for a light-hearted comedy with plenty of unfortunate situations, this would be a movie that should show up on that list.  It will entertain you over the years as it has done for me and the type of comedy on display does not lose its humor as the years pass by.",1349913600,6,1069,4.262376237623762

783598,3,6304094973,"'Black Sheep' by David Spade and Chris Farley is a funny movie. Chris Farley stars as Mike Donelly, the brother of a congressman-hopeful Al Donelly, who has aspirations to go all the way to the white-house.

However, one problem is Mike keeps creating diversions. He's an hilarious walking disaster, everywhere he goes there's chaos. Eventually, Al prescribes a weaselly beaurocrat called Steve Dodds (played by David Spade) to simply do one job, keep Mike out of trouble! Of-course, that seems like an easy task, but soon turns out to be really difficult. Eventually Al the congressman sends both of them into a cabin in the deep woods somewhere, hopefully out of harms reach.

Things go from bad to worse as the cabin turns into a nightmare house full of bats, a roof that falls off and lets the 'elements' in and doesn't want to sit straight. They become targets of a wild war veteran and a gang aggressive kids. Mike feels so bad about it all that he gets up on stage in front of 'young voters' who were enjoying a concert and giving them an exciting prep-talk on the up[coming election until dropping one of the most embarrrassing slip of the tongue's of all political history! But you'll never believe who saves the day for Al Donelly in the end.

While the movie was funny, I grew tired a bit of Chris Farley's constant over-acting, and, judging by the look on David Spade's face, he was growing a little tired of it too. That said, Farley is great as the incompetent dope who could ruin almost anything, and you'll enjoy watching the wild and funny adventures of Mike and Steve.",1347235200,,1586,4.637010676156583

783621,3,6304094973,"Black Sheep(released Feb/96)was the second vehicle that starred SNL alumni Chris Farley and David Spade,the first having been Tommy Boy. Both were successes at the box office,but this film is straining for laughs at most times. SNL creator Lorne Michaels was at the helm but the I-can-see-this-joke-coming-a-mile-away thing is just beaten to death here. Farley's familiar gesticulations coupled with his screaming at the top of his voice ""Oh my God"" or ""Stawwp!"" with a red face,may have worked well in other venues but they fall flat here. Spade here is comedically neutered;his sharp ""counter-punches"" have been turned into wrist slaps. I recall that the filming of this was less than a pleasant experience for all involved,especially the writer,director,producer and Spade. It's a wonder it got made at all,with the off screen acrimony to have seemingly contributed to the lacklustre end product.
The story is a simple one. A candidate for Governor of Washington one Al Donnelly(Tim Matheson,who starred in a spate of frat house films in the /80s),as a younger brother Mike played by Chris Farley who is kind of the ""black sheep"" of the family;a good hearted guy but kind of a bull in a china shop and stumble bum. A man on Al's campaign staff Steve Dodds(Spade)offers to keep an eye on Al's brother until the campaign is over.
While driving into town Steve gets his car taken by a local recluse named Drake Sabbitch(played with great elan by Gary Busey),after he insults him. In no time it seems Steve has got his hands full with Mike as one faux paux follows quickly after yet another. On top of this two things are on the go:a couple of snoopy reporters are following Mike and Steve getting compromising pictures of Mike and the incumbent governor who Al is running against,is playing dirty ball by fixing votes and trying to play up Mike's bumbling for public consumption.
While up in the boonies Steve and Mike run across Steve's stolen car at Drake's house but end up getting jumped by him. As Sabbitch leans hard on Steve,Mike comes to the rescue with some good take down moves and the two become instant friends. A plan is formulated to get hard evidence against the governor and her staff and to hi-jack her conference in Olympia,along with the help of Drake.
They crash the conference and after Mike crashes to the ground from the top of a remote TV aerial,he takes a security guards gun and takes Steve as his hostage,to gain attention. Joined on the podium is Drake. Between them  they prove beyond a doubt the fraud that has been perpetrated on the voters. As the film ends Mike and Al are back as family should be and as Mike sees his brothers small jet off,his coat gets caught in the door and off he flies with his brother-on the outside of course.
Juvenile jokes galore such as:Farley ""falling"" down a mountain side,with his ""memorable"" line at the bottom""What was with that?"",a large stone sitting precariously above the cabin that you just KNOW is going to come down on the cabin at some point and does,miniatures of the cabin at night with the roof blowing off then Farley above Spade in a bunk bed when it hails through the open roof,and on and on. Regarding this last one,it is another perfect example of how Spade's counterpoint lacks any punch and the overall gag falls flat. When it hails he asks Farley in the bunk above him how the weather is ""up there"",as Farley gets pummeled by ever deepening hail. It is not the usual biting sarcasm we are used to from Spade and when Farley's upper bunk inevitably gives out(as we know it will)and smunches Spade,any laugh that ever was in that set up,is fully dissipated. And of course we have the ""beautiful"" line when Farley is driving a police cruiser,is stopped and is talking to a another policeman,with Spade as his ""prisoner"",pointing to Spade he says"" He...butchered 400 chickens and crewed a beagle"".Memorable,no?.....NO!
Technically speaking the DVD is in w/s format and the picture is pretty clear and the sound is good. There are no extras.
All in all a disappointing Farley/Spade movie and just plain disappointing over all,especially the from the gags,which are telegraphed ahead,mostly juvenile and executed terribly. Not a great notch in the belt of the late Farley's legacy.",1317600000,,4260,4.827633378932968
783622,3,6304094973,"Despite the diligent efforts of Chris Farley (1964-1997), who delivers most of the movie's funniest moments, Black Sheep lacks the substance and cohesiveness to be a solid comedy.  With issues that are mostly story and character related, the various pieces just don't seem to fit together very well.  The script was apparently rushed, and there were some major issues between director Penelope Spheeris (Wayne's World films) and David Spade.

Mike Donnelly (Farley), who works at a recreation center, is the younger brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson), who is running for governor of the great state of Washington, taking on the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole).  Mike is well intentioned, but his screw ups are proving to be an embarrassment to the campaign, so brother Al approves of a plan to put Mike to work where he can't do any damage.  Steve Dodds (David Spade), a member of Donnelly's staff is assigned to keep Mike out of trouble, as the pair are sent to a cabin deep in Wenatchee National Forest.  There they meet Drake Sabitch (Gary Busey), a right wing type who lives in a trailer in the woods.  When the election results come in, Governor Tracy appears to have squeezed out a narrow victory, but when Mike finds evidence of voter fraud, he and Dodds race to the capitol to expose the crime.

Chris Farley tries to make the most of a script that is a hodgepodge of ideas, and lacks a tight storyline.  Slapstick physical comedy is Farley's forte, and he displays these talents many times.  Unfortunately David Spade, Farley's co-star in Tommy Boy (1995), has much less to do, and isn't particularly funny, as Steve Dodds is mostly a twerp who gets squashed down by everyone, and even wets himself.  Tim Matheson is a decent actor, but he and Farley just do not match up well as brothers.  Grant Heslov as Mike's police officer buddy, provides minor comic support.  There's not much plot development regarding Governor Tracy's dirty deeds, or a teenage kid that Mike befriends.  In the end, while Chris Farley provides some funny moments, the story just seems slapped together, rattling along with a lot of loose ends.

783674,3,6304094973,"In 1996, ""Saturday Night Live"" comedians Chris Farley and David Spade teamed up once again for ""BLACK SHEEP"".  With the success of ""Tommy Boy"" (1995), the stars joined ""WAYNE'S WORLD"" director Penelope Spheeris (""Little Rascals"", ""Beverly Hillbillies"", ""The Decline of Western Civilization Part II and Part III"", etc.) and writer Fred Wolf (""Joe Dirt"", ""Without a Paddle"", ""Strange Wilderness"", etc.).

The film was not well-received and the late film critic Gene Siskel said this film was one of the two films he has ever walked out on.  The film grossed around over $32 million during its theatrical run.

The film revolves around Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley), the loving brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson) who is running for Governor of Washington.  Unfortunately, Mike is very clumsy and seems to have his share of bad luck.

While Al is giving a speech, Mike who is driving a rundown vehicle with a loudspeaker (asking for people to vote for his brother).  But the neighborhood dogs are following the vehicle, so Mike decides to find a way to ditch them.  First he starts yelling into the mic with no success and then he starts to outrun them.  Unfortunately, he loses control of the vehicle and destroys parking meters, cars and runs straight into the town's movie theater, right in front of where his brother is giving a speech.

Al's political campaign manager Roger Kovary (Timothy Carhart) advises Al that his brother is bringing shame to the campaign and that he may need someone to watch over him.  So, Steve Dodds (David Spade), a campaign aide volunteers to watch over Mike.

Steve's first impression of Mike is in disbelief as he is covered in oil and slams the hood of the car he is repairing on his own fingers.  During a campaign promotional, Mike tries to help an old couple with their groceries (even if they don't want it) and gets his tie caught in the trunk and is dragged all over the parking lot.  When Steve goes to pick Mike up, he accidentally hits a veteran's car, Drake Sabitch (Garey Busey).  Because of that, Sabitch steals Steve's car.

Now, it seems that with Steve near Mike, he may get a taste of his bad luck.  To make things worse, Mike gets in more trouble as he tries to stop kids from drinking alcohol and ends up being photographed by the local paper as a guy who supports underage kids from drinking.  Mike is fired from the county's REC center.

Noticing Mike's continuing troublesome nature, Governor Evelyn Tracy (Christine Ebersole) who is running against Al, decides to go dirty in her campaign and bring shame to Al Donnelly by framing Mike with an accident. Hoping that Mike would be a distraction to her rival.

Tracy has two men commit arson by burning the REC center but to make it look like Mike did it as retaliation for being fired.  Steve arrives to the scene and is shocked to see the whole REC burning and is not too sure if Mike did it or not, even if Mike tells him that he didn't do it. Fortunately for Mike, his cop buddy Robby Mighuem (Grant Heslov) arrives to the scene first and tells Mike to leave and he won't tell anyone that they were at the premises.

Roger advises Al that because of all the trouble Mike is bringing to the campaign, his idea is to have Mike brought to an area where he can't cause any trouble since they are now in the final stage of the campaign, weeks before the election date.  So, Steve brings Mike to a secluded area in the mountainside and with nothing but a cabin nearby, what problem can the two have?  Unfortunately, with Mike's bad luck, trouble will always follow.

Can Mike stay away long enough from making things worse for his brother's campaign?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""BLACK SHEEP"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and because the film was shot primarily outdoors, the picture quality features a lot of vibrant colors.  Typically with many films released between the late 80's and mid-90's, there is a softness that comes with the picture quality on Blu-ray, and color is often muted.  But for this 13-year-old film, picture quality is pretty good compared to the original DVD.

Audio is featured in English 5.0 Dolby TrueHD (and French 2.0 Dolby Surround and Spanish 5.0 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily front channel heavy and as a comedy film, is primarily dialogue based.  But because you have well-known rock n' roll director Penelope Spheeris in control, her films tend to utilize music and in this case, during the grunge era, this film features the band Mudhoney.  Dialogue is clear and there are a few cases of action sequences, especially during a scene when a big boulder crashes down into the cabin that Mike and Steve are staying in.  But for a comedy film, audio quality is satisfactory.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The ""BLACK SHEEP"" Blu-ray Disc release does not contain any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""BLACK SHEEP"" is a film that you either love or hate.  Where SNL alumni Mike Myers and Dana Carvey dominated the early 90's with ""WAYNE'S WORLD"", SNL team Chris Farley and David Spade followed in the mid-90's with a few films.

Chris Farley's comedy is self-deprecating as he knows how to utilize his body weight to showcase clumsiness and moronic behavior quite well for the role of Mike Donnelly.  Where David Spade is more calm and collected in this film, Farley really goes all out and he makes his scenes of bad decision making seem plausible because he is so clumsy.

And because of that, many critics tend to be disgusted by this style of comedy, while there are those who saw his comedy as genius and a man who knew how to win the audience.  He will be a talent remembered for comedy films like ""BLACK SHEEP"", ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Beverly Hills Ninja"".

With that being said, ""BLACK SHEEP"" is definitely a film which you can't be too serious about, nor can you be logical and wonder how Mike gets away with all this trouble and destruction. You just take it in as a comedy where you just wonder how far Chris Farley will go with his hilarious and wacky antics.

As for the Blu-ray, if you own the DVD, there is not much extra to expect from this Blu-ray release.  There are no special features and the sound is 5.0 Dolby TrueHD (no subwoofer utilization).  So, it all comes down to picture quality and if that is enough for you to double dip.

""BLACK SHEEP"" may not be for everyone but if you are familiar with the style of Happy Madison Production type of films or Chris Farley films in general, you know what to expect.",1242691200,3,6536,4.646649260226284
783675,4,6304094973,"""Black Sheep"" is merely a retooling of ""Tommy Boy,"" but in cases like this, it doesn't matter. It was made purely for laughs, not to make a statement or impress with a display of great scriptwriting. ""Tommy Boy"" has a far superior script, and despite several flaws in the screenplay and continuity, it was a genuinely good movie, on every level. This one was simply made for a quick buck, and some laughs. It piggy-backed on the other's success.

First, let me state the obvious: The Spade-Farley team was right up there with all the great comedy teams of the ages. The physical differences, as well as everything else. Spade - short and little, caustic wit, a mean streak, really snarky: Farley - big, obese, low-brow approach (though he himself was bright, he played stupid very well), affable and friendly, a loose cannon. Look at the others - Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Aykroyd and Belushi and so on. They fit the template. But it ended way too soon. Farley left us way too soon, and he was one of the funniest human beings of all time. And Spade just added to it.

""Black Sheep"" has a fairly simple premise: Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the underachieving train-wreck brother of Al Donnelly, a rare person. He is an actual honest politician. (The writers of this movie wisely avoided party politics; it's up to the viewer to decide who is the conservative and who is the liberal. They avoided this altogether. That would have been a mistake which would have nose-dived this picture right into the ground.) But Mike wants to help his brother win the election, no matter what he has to do to get this done. The story pairs him with David Spade, on a series of misadventures which are genuinely funny, especially as executed by these two comic geniuses.

The opening scene is proof that sometimes pure nonsense, depicted with no explanation whatsoever, can leave one rolling with laughter. Farley is driving the campaign vehicle through town, making announcements to the public about Al Donnelly's candidacy for governer, but for some completely unknown reason, all the unleashed dogs in town are following the truck, barking as if they were on a wild pack's hunt. ""...WHAT'S WITH THESE DOGS?!..."" He can't shake them, and ultimately wrecks the truck, and suddenly, the dogs just cool it. There's no back story, no explanation, but it is hilarious nonetheless.

Throughout, Farley's ""Mike"" character suffers mishap after mishap, some of which could result in serious bodily injuries, and where I don't much care for slapstick, it's impossible to not laugh at it all. And Farley often did his own stunts as well. It's amazing, what he put himself through, willingly, to make his audience laugh.

783681,3,6304094973,"After their extremely funny and very successful comedy smash TOMMY BOY, Chris Farley and David Spade joined forces again and came up with BLACK SHEEP, a movie that can almost best be described as a TOMMY BOY wanna-be. In BLACK SHEEP Chris Farley plays Mike Donnelly, a simple-minded, klutzy, and sometimes off-the-handle troubled youth worker who is an embarrassment to his older brother Al (Tim Matheson) who is running for the governor of Washington. Mike really wants his brother to win and does everything he can to campaign for him, but his best intentions always seem to bring about disastrous results. In an attempt to keep Mike in check, Al's campaign managers assign aide Steve Dodds (David Spade) to take Mike to a cabin in the mountains and keep him from causing any trouble. This proves impossible to do, and Mike continues to get into trouble. However, along the way Steve and Mike uncover evidence of a fixed election and set out to bring justice.

BLACK SHEEP is a water-downed version of TOMMY BOY. Chris Farley plays the dufus relative of a person of power. David Spade plays the person assigned to watch over him. The family's power is lost and Chris and Dave go on a road trip to re-establish the family's position. There are some funny moments in BLACK SHEEP, but some of them are direct copies of jokes from TOMMY BOY, while most of the others just aren't all that funny. The similarities between the two movies don't stop there. Farley plays the same football play with his youth center kids as he does while cow-tipping in TOMMY BOY and the car that Farley and Spade's characters drove in TOMMY BOY can be seen parked in front of the youth center that Mike Donnelly works at. There are even a couple of times in the movie where Farley almost refers to Spade's character as ""Richard"" (the character Spade played in TOMMY BOY).

I'm a fan of Chris Farley. I think he was a comic genius that never achieved his full potential. He lost his life because of an addiction to drugs and that addiction affected much of his later work, including BLACK SHEEP.

I'm not as big a fan of David Spade's, but I do enjoy many of his characters. He is at his best when he's going off on a witty, biting sarcastic rant or when he is playing over-the-top characters (e.g. MEET JOE DIRT). Unfortunately in BLACK SHEEP he really doesn't get to do either and it affects the quality of the movie.

Overall, BLACK SHEEP is just an average comedy that borders on below average. The presence of Farley and Spade keep it from falling below the brink, but just barely. It's a far lesser movie than TOMMY BOY, but it is a film that illustrates the decline and fall of Farley as both a comedian and a person struggling with addiction.",1161648000,,2726,4.579918032786885

The gross was very similar and the cost of production were on par with one another.  Considering inflation was not a factor in the differing numbers as well, there is very little to indicate that this film failed.  On DVD this film has sold well, granted not as well as Tommy Boy.  Regardless making false claims that it tanked and does not compare is a result is simply not true.  The film although similar is very good and worth the view.",1125273600,4,723,4.637795275590551

Also donate to the Chris Farley Foundation, which is run by Farley's two brothers. Comedy is good for you, drugs aren't.

Anyways, ""Black Sheep"" is hilarious. Yes, David Spade returns as Steve to babysit clumsy oaf Mike Donnelhy (Farley) while Mike's brother, Al, runs for Washington state governor. The movie really gets rolling when Steve and Mike stay at a lodge in the woods of Washington. When a boulder rolls down and hits the house, making it slide down the grade, everything moves, except the refrigerator, which is held in by the plug, until it is unplugged and slammed against Mike, who then says, ""I've got a bowl of chocolate pudding down my pants."" Steve responds, ""We didn't have any pudding in there.""

Another crackup is when Mike calls top bunk, but in the middle of the night, the roof blows off and it hails inside. While Mike is being pelted by hail, Steve laughs and teases him by mimicing, ""I call top bunk."" Pretty soon, the top bunk lands on Steve.

I don't want to spoil the movie any more than I did, but you need to watch this for yourself. Get the other movies with Chris Farley in them, even Billy Madison and Dirty Work. Those are also crackups, and Norm MacDonald stars in both.",1111190400,11,1494,4.425454545454546

We experienced the magic of the Farley/Spade comedy connection in ""Tommy Boy""; why didn't they just leave well-enough alone?  Were these guys in some alternate reality planning to become the next Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis comedy collaboration?  Granted, the movie does star Chris Farley and David Spade, so it has its moments (how could it not?).  Beyond that, ""Black Sheep"" has no rhyme or reason.  Don't waste a minute of your time on this.  Chances are, you've already seen it.",1062460800,2,542,4.8901098901098905

It's a real treat to watch him on screen; even if some of his comedic bits are a bit sophmoric and just an extension of what he did on television, it's almost impossible not to like what he does.",1053993600,,378,4.178082191780822
783769,4,6304094973,"To put it simply, Black Sheep is on my list of Top 100 Funniest Movies Ever. The chemistry between Chris Farley (RIP) and David Spade is unbelievable (not to mention side-splitting). Their performance in this movie is great, and fans will enjoy such timeless moments as ""Kill Whitey!"", short-circuited headbanging, the nitrous oxide, David Spade being ""extinguished,"" and Chris Farley wearing bunny ears. If you like comedy, this is not a movie you want to miss. Another noteworthy part of this movie is the role of Gary Busey as a fanatic war veteran with a prosthetic leg who lives in a school bus surrounded by land mines.

As you can see, I love this movie, and give it 5 stars. However, as a DVD I give it only 4. I paid good money for it, and what do I get? The movie. And only the movie. There are no special features whatsoever, which is what makes this such a miserable DVD. The persons who compiled this should have taken the time to at least get an interview with David Spade and Gary Busey and put the original theatrical trailer on the DVD. This ""compilation"" pales in comparison to the modern standards of DVDs. In my opinion though, the movie is so great that it alone nearly justifies the cost, even though you can buy it on VHS - minus only surround sound and French audio - for a fraction of that price.",1048723200,,1321,4.458677685950414
783770,1,6304094973,"While Tommy Boy was no masterpiece, it had some funny moments. This film is terrible from start to finish. The writing is lousy, the acting is uninspired; everyone only seems to be there for a paycheck. I get the feeling that Chris Farely was depressed, on drugs, and only doing this for money. There were fat jokes in Tommy Boy, but they're in almost every scene, and I felt bad for Chris Farley being the butt of the joke again and again. Perhaps a few weight jokes are tolerable, but after the 38th time, it just becomes boring and kind of depressing.",1048464000,5,554,4.4411764705882355
783771,3,6304094973,"After Chris Farley (R.I.P) and David Spade's first comedy hit, they made another one together called ""Black Sheep"". Personally I think this movie is as good as Tommy Boy. Farley and Spade have done it again.
The setting starts out in Washington state. Mike Donelly (Farley) is the goofy, lame-brain brother of Al Donelly (Tim Matheson) who is running for governor. Mike can't stop getting into trouble and it makes his brother look bad as he tries to win the election. So, Al comes across Steve Dodds (Spade) and hires him to watch his brother and keep him out of trouble.
As the two set out to promote Al's canadicy for governor, they get set-up for an arsenal fire by Al's opponent, the current Governor Tracy. So the two are sent out to the woods in the mountains of Washington to hide out. The cabin they stay in is falling apart. The roof flies off during a wind and hail storm and a boulder hits the house.
Will Al win the election? Can Mike stay out of trouble? Find out what happens next. This movie is a top choice for any Farley movie lover.",1047513600,,1051,4.422680412371134
783772,3,6304094973,"I love Chris Farley but this movie is not his best.  I know this has been said before but to quote ""I liked it the first time I saw it when it was called Tommy Boy"".
The name of Farley's character has changed his profession has changed and so has the name of David Spade's.  It is still hilariously funny up it will always in my mind be overshadowed by Tommy Boy.",1045699200,2,363,4.027777777777778
783773,4,6304094973,"I must agree with the prior two reviews.  You cannot compare this movie to ""Tommy Boy"".  And that's for two reasons: one, Chris Farley's characters are usually about the same; therefore it is hard to differentiate his movies.  And two, ""Tommy Boy"" was a breakout film for him, his best ever, and you can't expect one man to produce consistency of that caliber time and time again.  With that said, you must enjoy ""Black Sheep"" for what it is.  And what is is a hilarious movie.
In the movie, Mike Donnelly (Farley) and Steve Dodds (Spade) are two very different guys.  Mike's a laughable fat guy who does everything he can to help his brother Al (Tim Matheson) win his election.  Whereas Steve Dodds is a sad crass little man who is given the job of 'servicing', so to speak, Mike on the campaign run.  As I'm sure you can imagine the servicing does not go quite as planned.  And that's where most of the movie's comedy is generated.  Mike makes many attempts to help his brother yet only seems to hurt him.  And Dobbs, along with many others, does whatever he can to keep Mike away from the campaign all-together.  It's really very sad to see the way in which Farley's character is treated.  I'm sure you'll feel bad for him, even if you didn't like the ""kill whitey"" episode.  We all know he didn't mean it.
I, unlike many other fans, show great appreciation for Chris Farley's work in this movie.  The director Penelope Spheeris (who brought us such comedies as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Senseless"") does a great job in making us laugh.  Even if the laughter seems to be a quiet mirth compared to that of ""Tommy Boy"".  But I said I wouldn't comare the two, so scratch that last remark.
I gave ""Black Sheep"" 4 stars because it is better than most comedies you'll find.  It's also a classic Farley movie, one that I think every fan can appreciate.  It ranks about #33 on my favorite movie list, which is pretty high looking at some of the movies which outdo it (and for those of you who have to know, ""Tommy Boy"" is #4).  So see this movie and enjoy it.  I know I did.",1044748800,,2064,4.3931398416886545

However, Mike's desperate attempts to try to help his brother's campaign always turn into something destructive.  In order to keep Mike under control, his brother sends Steve Dodds (David Spade) to keep Mike away from Washington towns in order to avoid future embarrassment.  This, however, is a harder task than what Steve had imagined it to be, and things begin to turn ugly.  Black Sheep is a comedy that survives on sarcasm, slapstick humor, and occasional wit.  The end result is an average film experience that produces laughs, but not more.",1044403200,3,644,5.037735849056604
783835,4,6304094973,"BLACK SHEEP was another great one from the team of Farley and Spade. This one is sometimes underrated but I think it was still a good one. First and foremost, DO NOT compare this movie to TOMMY BOY because when you do, most of the time people get disappointed. Seriously, take BLACK SHEEP as it is because this is a funny movie.
Farley is Mike Donnelly and his brother Al is running for Senator in Washington state. When Al's political advisor suggests that Mike go on a hands on political movement to some small towns in rural Washington. Al feeling that it would be a good idea so Mike doesn't bumble anything up, he sends another one of his assistants, Steve Dodge (David Spade) with him. In laugh out loud Farley and Spade manner, they deliver some really good laughs and a total jab at politics.
Like I said before, don't compare this to TOMMY BOY. BLACK SHEEP is it's own movie and not a carbon copy of a previous idea. This movie delivers some really good laughs like the concert scene, when the kids beat up Spade and who could forget the police car scene? Trust me, the style of comedy is way different in this one.
Seriously, you should pick this one up. It's really funny and enjoyable. There's some swearing,sexual content and drug use but other than that, it's totally mild. If you're looking for some other good ones, check out TOMMY BOY from Spade and Farley, HAPPY GILMORE and WAYNE'S WORLD. Enjoy!",1042070400,2,1414,4.52734375
783836,5,6304094973,"Chris Farley was a comic genius, and this film amply shows why and why he is sorely missed. As the brother of a gubernatorial candidate, he tries to help his brother's campaign, but most every attempt backfires. Sent off to the backwoods to keep him out of the way, his misadventures continue. There he pairs up with another character played by David Spade, and the two make a swell comic duo. They meet up with a carload reminiscent of DELIVERANCE. Their cabin plummets down a landslide after the balance of a balanced rock is upset in a most unlikely way. And they meet up with a crazed survivalist-type neighbor played by Gary Busey. Some of these events will all play out to make for the final resolution when they finally return to civilization. On that return, the movie's peak of zaniness is reached in an episode involving a car with a nitrous oxide booster.

Not a week goes by that me and my friend Donald don't quote a line from this movie or another one of Farley great comedic accomplishments.
