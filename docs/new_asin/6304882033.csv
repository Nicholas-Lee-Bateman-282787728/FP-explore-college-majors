7879646,5,6304882033,"Perfect companion for the writings, both of Thiering and the Scrolls themselves. Although for an unprepared mind, the documentary will at first raise more questions and curiosity than give easy-to-be-accepted answers, the reading of Thiering's books and the accompanying book written after the documentary by Leonie Star (named after the latter), helps make this documentary and what it tries to convey feel come across as common sense. That is, if you have successfully worked thru dis-attaching yourself from any of the prevailing Christian views on the source and credibility of the scriptures, at least to a point that you're open to accept fresh ideas, if only for the fact that the claims made by the accepted views are, to say the least, dubious. 2,000 Years of Christian churches and Christianity based on what ? It's interesting how this material made available and accessible by Thiering (and others) keeps it relevance thru the years and decades,and yet, at the same time, seems like almost forgotten. It is for the individual then, like Thiering, and ourselves, to pick it up and distill an understanding and relevance of the writings, as they have been handed down thru the millenia. If you're a believer, the material will question your beliefs, and, depending on how you take this material in, your spiritual/religious life might never be the same anymore. But that, could be a blessing (in disguise).",1451174400,,1416,5.107758620689655

7879649,5,6304882033,"This is the story of the Dead Sea Scrolls with a completely different import from what the churches involved have been saying.  A wonderfully original look at some facts the churches take for granted and which are completely outside the 'box'.  A must-see for serious students of the Christian religion, as well as those who question its facts. I had many ""Aha!"" moments watching this.",1306454400,2,385,4.907692307692308
7879650,1,6304882033,"My comments are based on the 1990 edition. I have to say that this Discovery program was not a surprise.  It was positively appalling in its blatant, Antichristian and Anticatholic content, obviously deliberately designed to promote apostasy-loss of Christian faith and belief.  After causing some doubt and confusion about the validity of the Dead Sea Scrolls, they then launch into subtle attacks disclaiming the validity of many Christian beliefs, which seemingly is the real theme.

In this program, a supposed religious scholar, Dr. Barbara Thiering, of Sydney University, Australia, continually offers plausible natural and secular disclaimers for many Christian beliefs in the New Testament.  Somehow she is knowledgeable of many First Century era customs and practices that seemed to glibly explain away Jesus' miracles and other Pre-Christian and First Century events, without offering any real proof to support her claims.  Some of her explanations seem very bizarre, such as asserting that Jesus and John the Baptist were political rivals.  The upshot is that all of her explanations take a grain of truth and then twist it around into something wholly unrecognizable by a true Christian Believer, a classic example of the Scriptural reference to false prophets in the End Days teaching things not taught by the apostles.  One would conclude that either she didn't have a clue, or was deliberately twisting the Scriptures to suit an Antichristian agenda of causing doubt and confusion.  I would suggest the latter.  In essence, she is saying that Christian beliefs are baseless.  What effrontery from an Antichristian!

The material presented was so outrageous and bizarre that I had to finally shut the program down well before it was finished.  Had this presentation had Islam or Judaism as its subject, rather than Christianity, Muslims and Jews would be up in arms, with the Muslims undoubtedly reacting as they do to most things that impugn their faith, by rioting and swearing out retaliation on the perpetrators.  But of course, Christianity is a faith of love of God and neighbor, not of force and violence.

If the definition of a Christian is one who believes in the Divinity of Christ and the Biblical teachings, then Dr. Thiering does not fulfill those requirements.  Virtually everything she said flew in the face of traditional Christian beliefs.  Thus, she and others like her are what I like to call, ""Enemies of the Church.""  Whether witting or unwitting, they are still enemies of Jesus Christ.  The presentation is whoppingly dishonest, in that they present as probable facts, other explanations for Christian beliefs.  Her logic is specious at best.  That the producers of this program are Antichristian is borne out by the circumstance that real Christian believers would never present this bizarre and dishonest material, and as fact.

The ultimate Antichristian is, of course Satan.  He has the support of uncountable demonic fellow travelers, of both supernatural and human nature, whose goals are to offend and insult God by assisting him in turning humankind away from the Triune God through lies, sin, indifference and apostasy.

I offer my comments above to alert you to this program, that any Christians and curious non-Christians coming across this video tape are strongly urged to avoid it as clearly being a dishonest, devious and insidious attack on the Christian faith and belief, and best left alone.  If it is in their library, throw it away.  It is worse than worthless.  Were it possible, I would rate this program with NO stars.",1139443200,3,3578,5.179130434782609
7879651,5,6304882033,"Stand Way Aside DaVinci Code, you've Got A Lot To Learn From Dr. Thiering and the Modern Day Scholars!  This is the ONE that needs Nationale Attention to preserve History over Mythology! I don't suppose the Greeks thought thier Mythology was Mythology at the Time Either! In a 1000 years or so, The Lord Of The Rings might be found under a dust pile somewhere and the birth of a new religion will take place! Then Scholars will have to come about and show that it was only a story of Fiction and Religious Fanatics at that time and try to debunk it as such.  Not claiming the Bible is necessarily all Fiction, but rather History in the Guise of Parables, etc.., just as even Jesus himself said in the Bible (PARABLES); yet people don't want to Believe Him! Hey, the BLOOD LINE of David can only be through Josepah, wake up!

Religious Fanatics have been Hard-Wired by the Churches to assume they have Truth!  The instilling of ""Fear"" is a good control for keeping people for TRULY 'thinking for themselves.' Many claim to think for themselves, however, it's quite humerous to note how they are typically in agreement with their respective church 100% of the time!

There is know rationale discussion that can take place with those who write reviews invoking 'Satan' and 'Hell' etc.., as just by evoking such they are showing their own ignorance to their very own Bible and ingnorance to reality and are void of having any semblance of a rational thought process.  Most of them think Gehenna and The Valley Of Hinom is Hell, despite the fact that it is a location you can pinpoint on a map where the carcasses of dead criminals were burned to the point that the fires would be continually lit!  These people are hopelessly 'Brain Washed For Life"" and will live in a World Of Illusion until the day they die!  This Video is clear to only the CLEAR THINKER! Those who's minds have been messed with by the handed down delusions the Churches perpetuate are lost causes!  They are more interested in holding on to thier old outdated beliefs than allowing History to reveal itself! These aren't people who have any ability to review anything of a Biblical Nature, because they are 'Hard-Wired' based upon belief and emotion.  To put it simply, They Don't Know What It Is They Don't Know, Nor Are They Likely To Ever Know!""  The reviewer(s) with the 'Satan' and ""Hell"" ranting is an example of how far the human mind still has to evolve; these people might as well go out and do a rain dance!

Belief in favor of True History is the name of the game.  Organized Religion has always perpetuated Mythologies, I'm amazed at the number of people who buy into this stuff.  However, considering all the `bad' things that happen in the world, unfortunately coupled with the superstitious nature of humans, as well as gullibility, along with the free promotional endeavors of the news company's, mythology flourishes and grows ever stronger and is preferred by the masses over that of `Reality.'  Organized religions wish to perpetuate their 'Mysticism' as opposed to genuine History, even though they probably don't realize it!  Dr. Thierings works help to keep History Alive despite the desperate attempts of fanatics to have thier belief system bend reality!

Take a look at the article regarding pseudoscience by

Rory Coker, Ph. D. at

...Excerpt from Article (The entire article contains many other relevant considerations) ****Pseudoscience DOES NOT PROGRESS.

.........within a given topic, NO PROGRESS IS MADE; LITTLE OR NO NEW INFORMATION OR UNCOVERED. New theories are seldom proposed, and OLD CONCEPTS ARE RARELY MODIFIED or DISCARDED in light of new ""discoveries,"" since pseudoscience rarely makes new ""discoveries."" The older the idea, the more respect it receives (See entire article)

Organized religion is synonymous with Pseudoscience.  Our knowledge of every topic under the sun changes with continued examination of all information. We wouldn't have computers, cell phones, fluorescent lights, flame resistant clothing, etc.., etc.., if we closed our minds to continued research. How is it that the world Religions believe that Religion is the only topic under the sun that man's knowledge cannot change?  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT NOT TO, unless you are a religious fanatic who would rather hold on to the status-quo!

The only people who have a problem with Dr. Thierings work are people who are merely afraid of having their religious beliefs  challenged.  Just because so many don't want her information to be true, doesn't mean it isn't. In actuality, TRUE scholars without religious bias find that her work holds much more weight than the outdated interpretations of old; however, desperation perpetuates the belief, despite the evidence to the contrary.

Here's a List of journal articles and other publications which have been published since 1990, when Dr. Thieirngs case became widely known. In most cases  she was asked to write them. The journal Dead Sea Discoveries, now publishing her technical work with more to come, is the major professional journal in the field.

""Can the Hasmonean Dating of the Teacher of Righteousness be Sustained?"", in Mogilany 1989. Papers on the Dead Sea Scrolls offered in memory of Jean Carmignac, ed. Z.J. Kapera, The Enigma Press Krakow, 1991.

7879652,5,6304882033,"The Discovery Channel's presentation of Barbara Thiering's challenges to Christian interpretation and tradition is a bold and illuminating program sure to ruffle a few feathers. In a time when the teaching of ""Creationism"" in public schools is once again a hot issue, this video can provide some convincing arguments against literal interpretations of Scripture. Thiering presents new insights on miracles like the feeding of the 5000, walking on water, the ""raising"" of Lazarus, and the ""transformation"" of water into wine, all based on the theory of the Peisher technique, a writing style that shrouds factual particulars with miraculous generalities. Opposing viewpoints are presented but none seem very convincing (to me, anyway). Lies from Satan? Whatever. I don't see how any rational mind could reject Thiering's proposals outright. Some may seem a bit adventurous and unsupported (like her theory of the crucifixion and resurrection), but all of them are rooted in logic. My only problem with this perspective is that it is presented under the immediate assumption that Jesus really DID exist (an assumption I am not entirely convinced of).
