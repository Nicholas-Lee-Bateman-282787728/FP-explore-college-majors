8401798,1,B003P1D8K0,"Coming out in dvd very late and in a bad copy does not help Orson Welles' reputation, and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) is simply a stuffy old movie,  crowded with equally stuffy drapes, furniture and mansions. The story of the  arrogant son, torturing his widowed mother and other family(ies) of a medium  size American town a good hundred years ago lacks any grand design his Citizen Kane (1941) has been praised for. Today, The Lady from Shanghai  (1947), Touch of Evil (1958) and The Trial (1962) are perhaps his best secondary films, and much of his other stuff - well, junk.",1312156800,,583,4.742574257425742
