A cursed bracelet turns people into killers...I suppose you could call them zombies if you want...and they did. Weak plot and script. The solution for beating the Devil was pretty simplistic. I wouldn't call this a horror film. It was humorous, especially the parts that weren't supposed to be.",1522454400,,394,4.984848484848484
8636287,3,B00HV6AFLU,"this is where young people come to prepare for a career in film.  so don't pay attention to the terrible acting as there was no one around to direct them.  the art work is very good on the dvd case.  it had to be or we would never have bought this childish drivel.  enjoy yourself for a few minutes....

8636288,1,B00HV6AFLU,"Horrible movie. I usually can endure a terrible movie if it has beautiful babes in it, but this was torture. It's like a college class project or something. I should have been paid a thousand dollars to watch this thing!!!!",1507248000,2,223,4.6

8636291,1,B00HV6AFLU,"These 666 movies try to bring in ""Blast from the Past"" B-movie Scream Queens to possibly try to get people interested, but the Scream Queens usually have a very supporting role and the acting of the main actors and actresses are so wooden that you build a log cabin with them.  I guess I was expecting more.",1405987200,5,307,4.385964912280702
8636292,5,B00HV6AFLU,Can't wait for this one! Great cast and great cult director (Mr. Decoteau) .. Hopefully will be on Netflix as well?,1393891200,2,115,4.523809523809524
