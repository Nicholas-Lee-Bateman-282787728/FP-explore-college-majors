3480088,4,B001B1Q3EO,"This recording of the original 1985 performance of The Gospel at Colonus (based on Oedipus at Colonus) is one of the most remarkable adaptations of an ancient work for the the modern stage. Other reviewers have commented on the content and the action of the performance; I can only second their enthusiasm. I was blessed to see Gospel at Colonus live in 1996 when it was in Seattle. Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama are amazing live, and much of their unique energy powers this production.

I've waited for years with anxious enthusiasm for this release and if the CD soundtrack were a record, I'd have played the groove off of it. So I'm disappointed to declare a mixed success. The original performance is striking and though rooted in mid 1980s in terms of 'contemporary style' explains much of how it has been successfully adapted in succeeding productions and still remained fresh.

Unfortunately, I must turn my review to the production values of this long awaited DVD. They are abysmal: poor video and inexcusably bad audio. I disagree with other reviewers who assert that this quality is 'typical' of recordings of the time. (By contrast, look at the Great Performances live recording of the The Flying Karamazov Brothers production of Shakespeare's ""A Comedy of Errors"" at the Vivian Beaumont theater about the same time. The two are in different worlds of recording quality. Sorry...you can't look at it. Because despite that production's enormous influence on subsequent American productions during the last quarter century...PBS still hasn't made that recording available. My copy is the original 'off air' recording.)

Running several off the shelf video processing tools would have substantially improved the video quality of this presentation. And while items like vision mixing, camera placement, etc. can't be fixed in post production, the audio certainly could have been: the live performance that was video recorded for broadcast was the same performance recorded live for the excellently produced cast album, which has been available for years. merely patching in the crystal clear audio of the album as an alternate audio track on the DVD is the work of about 3 days in a post production studio. Clearly the producers of this DVD were more interested in ringing the cash register than in providing an archival quality recording of production. I'm tempted to do the work myself and put it up on fanedit.com because after listening to the album for years, listening to the audio DVD is almost painful.

So 4 stars for finally getting off the pot and getting this seminal work published. But one star lost for not giving a damn about what the quality of the product that they published. I'll be watching this production company closely from now on and be more prone to *RENT* their works before I commit to buying them.",1228780800,25,2852,4.997894736842105
3480089,5,B001B1Q3EO,"Despite themes of loss and death, a joyful, cathartic experience - possibly the most upbeat retelling of Sophocles' OEDIPUS AT COLONUS in existence. This musical adaptation by Lee Bruer and Bob Telson, presented by the American Music Theater Festival, was aired as an episode of PBS' Great Performances series in 1985. It is set after the fall of Oedipus, where as a poor, blind wanderer he goes to Colonus to die. If you like Retro Gospel/Soul, than this is for you.

  Features strong performances from Morgan Freeman and many artists of the day, such as Javetta Steele, Isabell Monk, the Soul Stirrers, Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama, all backed by the Institutional Radio Choir.

Standout songs include:
Stop, do not go on
How can I see you through my tears
A voice foretold (Blind Boys w/Clarence Fountain)
We will Never
Lift him up

The sound and video quality on this DVD is fairly good, typical for a stage production of the time. Unfortunately the Menu is bare bones: no special features or background notes, no sound setup, no Song listing, no commentary track. There is a libretto of this play available on Amazon.com...",1227916800,,1148,4.836734693877551

3480092,5,B001B1Q3EO,"Thank you WNET, New Video NYC and PBS! I was delighted to hear my Postman trying to put something in my mailbox and I knew it was the DVD. For those of you not on the religious tip please understand that is not a religious play; it is a musical drama that uses the musical styling of Gospel music to tell the Greek story of Oedipus.

There is so much good stuff. Morgan Freeman is excellent, the musicians, the huge chorus in the background that helps to tell the story. There is also the performers who have since passed. This may be your first and last opportunity to see why people are making such as fuss about this play.

It tells a very old story about a troubled man looking for a quiet place, blood revenge, redemption and the dynamics of family.

One of my favorite parts is when Oedipus and his daughter try to step into Colonus and the cast rips the audience up with ""Stop, Do Not Go On.""  You got to be damn near dead not to be moved by what happened on that stage.

If you are looking for a present for your mom or grandma I'm telling you it will put you at the grown folks table. If you own the video you will have to put it on lock down because it will disappear. It is that good.

This is a gift that folks can share with the entire family. Please make sure the younger generation get to see this video.",1227052800,,1319,4.11284046692607
3480093,5,B001B1Q3EO,"This was a wonderful play and I longed to know whether or not it ever would be offered on DVD. I am so glad that it is finally going to be on DVD. I will get one and I will tell all my friends so they can get one also.

Thank you ever so much for making this avaliable to the world by way of CD and DVD.

3480094,5,B001B1Q3EO,"I just received an e-mail from Thirteen/WNET NY informing me that The Gospel At Colonus DVD will be available on November 18, 2008 on Amazon.com. I wrote them awhile back asking why my favorite ""Great Performances"" was not on DVD.  Well it is finally here, thank you.

The Gospel At Colonus is one of the best interpretation/intergration of gospel music with a dramatic work(Greek Tragedy)I have ever seen. I enjoyed the music and performance so much that I'ved watched it at least 15 time on the old VHS tape I taped from TV when it aired on TBS.  I also saw the play twice when it came to New York and I have the music on CD. To say that I love this play is an understatement.  It is sad, insightful, exciting, colorful and the music will take you on an emotional rollercoster that leaves you breathless. You will feel like you are in church and Morgan Freeman's sermons will take you back home to your favorite southern preacher.  I will not give you details of the play, I will leave that to your enjoyment but if you are like me and love a play that inspires and entertains then this is a must buy.",1223683200,,1103,4.360975609756098

For YEARS, it was only available for academic purposes.  I have only an old VHS tape off my TV.  The program is based on the Greek play Oedipus at Colonus presented as a Black Revival operetta.  One highlight is the appearance of an early Morgan Freeman as the speaker.  Other actors include such greats as James Earl Jones, and the music is provided by such groups as The Five Blind Boys of Alabama.

The DVD version does a pretty good job of conveying this theatrical event's extraordinary impact.  Catch the young Morgan Freeman, indelible as the narrator here.

3480099,3,B001B1Q3EO,"My wife and I both love this performance. Our VHS tape of The Gospel at Colonus, made at the time of broadcast in 1985 (I think) is worn and got scrunched at the beginning; the first song is thus pretty much toast. So I was happy to find it on DVD, and bought it for my wife's birthday. So far as I can tell it's the performance that we taped. But the sound is truly dreadful. Now, I know that the performers we watched in 1985 were not lip synking, so I fail to understand how music which sounded so rich through the speakers of an old television set grabbing the signal out of the sky, could sound so poor on this DVD. I fooled with it for several minutes, but to no avail. It is a real disappointment.

The performance itself deserves all five stars and more.

But given the present state of technology, the sound reproduction on this DVD is what I'd expect from a garage in Korea. North Korea.",1418256000,,897,4.209302325581396

I caught a bit on PBS, back in the day, and later managed to score a nosebleed seat when it came to town. Even from back/up there the hair on my arms went up when the singer stepped in front of Clarence Fountain, blocking his way, ordering him to ""STOP!... Do not go on.""

I bought the audio cd when it became available, but while enjoyable, it just wasn't the same thing. This is it.

3480108,5,B001B1Q3EO,"This is a unique presentation of a universally recognized myth. The cultural interpretaion of Oedipus Rex via a Black Church community of Chorus singers and Narrators is perfect. Perfect because the LIterary translator's text, I believe it was Richard Latimore's was loyally adhered to as well as the Greek play's goals of Catharsis and awe. The use of Blind singers and Pianist enhanced the theme of the special insight granted Oedipus through blindness. The singing chorus's  presentation of the early Greek chanting was wonderful.y transposed to our present times and the Narration, acting, and solos reached excellence in interpretatio of the Greek original.. The l theatre version that toured Europe received rave notices. I saw it in Seattle. This DVD brought the same elation over the success of such a daring project..",1404777600,,826,5.257575757575758

But, the stage play being in my memory was not enough - I wanted a video or some hard copy of the stage play that I could put into the DvD Player and witness again and again.

I searched for this ""hard copy"" on-line and at first I thought that my search was fruitless.  I was reading on-line about others who had also seen the play and wanted some way that they could obtain it.  Finally, I saw that Amazon had the play on DvD and since I always order ""something"" from Amazon (Movies, MP3's, Adapters, an HP printer, etc.) I ordered Gospel At Colonus right away.  I trust Amazon and the others who sell on Amazon (I have yet to file a complaint). I did file a complaint once and I had to send the seller an Email stating that I was mistaken and that I apologize.  Anyway I have Gospel At Colonus to enjoy whenever I want pop it into the DvD Player.

I would like to make one last comment, I ordered a power adapter from Amazon and I believed it to be defected, I contacted Amazon about it and I received the best Customer Service that a consumer can ever receive from a company.  Although Amazon's policy was not to replace the adapter, they shipped me a replacement adapter free, shipping was also free.  What more do you ask of a company?

When, after more than a decade, it finally showed up for purchase, I bought six so I could share it with friends.  It is first and foremost a musical, and as a professional musician myself, I can assure you that the music is first-rate.  The choir is first-rate, the three main women soloists are stupendous (and beautiful), the Hammond B-3 player is outstanding, the soloist of the Five Blind Boys steals the show, and I weep tears of joyful emotion when ""Brother Willie"" with the purple gloves and the Sam Cooke voice sings his wonderful material.  Even Morgan Freeman does some intoning of the ""gospel"" as the preacher.  But it's the idea of this play that really disarms you.  The story of Oedipus and his sister-daughters is stunning enough, but told in this manner and style, makes your head spin.

I decided upon this after A LOT of searching, and I'm glad I did! The production quality could be better. However, the story is very well done. Don't let ""gospel"" freak you out. It's the story of Oedipus told in the gospel style of music.

For those of your considering it for a class, the following may help you decide. Again, it IS the story of Oedipus. It's a musical so there is creative license as it applies to songs obviously. My students originally looked at my like I was crazy when I played it, but I wanted them to see an interpretation of the play that was outside of their comfort zone. (Their assessment for Antigone involved creating their own dramatic interpretation of the play.) After watching it, they enjoyed it.

This is what first brought my attention to Morgan Freeman.  If you want a great stage gospel/inspirational musical presentation, then this is for you.",1236470400,,311,4.7924528301886795
3480142,5,B001B1Q3EO,"Folks,

This DVD is truly a thing of beauty.

As you've already read, this is a Gospelized version of the Oedipus Rex tale of classic Greek mythology. Sort of a Gospel Opera. Sure beats ""Godspell"" by a country mile!

Admittedly, it helps to have some familiarity with the original story, but the music and the performances are so uplifting that it almost doesn't matter. If ""Live Where You Can"" and ""How Can I See You Through my Tears"" does not move you, you have a heart of stone.

Those who have an understanding of the Black American church tradition (that is, the less conservative churches) will take a special joy in ""Lift Him Up,"" where the choir/congregation genuinely ""catch the spirit"" in a way rarely captured before on film. This is not acting here folks, this is the real thing. Viewers who are unfamiliar with the Black church tradition are really in for a sight to behold!

Morgan Freeman is mesmorising in his role as the preacher. His final sermon in the show must be heard by anyone who has ever lost a loved one.

On the whole, those who love Gospel are in for a true emotional and joyful experience. Verily I say that this DVD will make you want to get down on your knees afterward and thank GOD for allowing Thomas Edison for inventing sound recordings and motion pictures!",1234396800,2,1294,4.556034482758621
3480143,5,B001B1Q3EO,"I have wanted this particular play for a very long time. I remember seeing it when it first was aired on PBS and instantly fell in love with the soundtrack.  I find the way the Greek tragedy ""Oedipus at Colonus was merged with modern day Gospel was brilliant.  A wonderful experience and it was fun to watch a family friend in the chorus.",1233878400,2,338,4.349206349206349
3480144,5,B001B1Q3EO,"1986- saw the show in Minneapolis live 5 times; purchaseds the soundtrack on vinyl, cassette and CD

This is a thoroughly enjoyable filmed version of the production that was given in Philadelphia in 1985 and which received raved reviews. It's not to be missed.",1229040000,2,574,6.77027027027027
