8082078,4,B000B64TVE,"This DVD contains two episodes of Shalom Sesame; the Chanukah episode and ""Sing Around the Seasons"".  My children enjoy both, but the Chanukah program is the better of the two episodes. Shalom Sesame introduces us to Oscar The Grouch's Israeli cousin, Moise Oofnick who plays a prime role in this episode selling unpalatable versions of sufganiyot (jelly doughnuts).  Children will learn the basics of the history and traditions of Chanukah, a little Hebrew, and a little bit about Israel along the way. Kids will even learn how to play with a dreidel.  Although, the program seems outdated in places, it is still enjoyable and my kids have watched it repeatedly just as they have other episodes of Sesame Street.  We had this in VHS before we purchased the DVD and this video has become a holiday tradition in our household.",1186876800,6,825,4.871428571428571
