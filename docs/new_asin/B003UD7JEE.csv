4195592,4,B003UD7JEE,"For those of us who are the purists and started with the French subtitled ""Le Femme Nikita,"" the parallel is very good.  Granted, I do not have a reasonable opinion as to the previous Nikita television series but I must say that this new series is interesting in and of its own right.
  Luckily, there is more gun play than other similar action-spy series but not overwhelmingly.  And I for one like the unpredictability of Maggie Q as a lethal agent (that would be the last thing I would expect with her dolled up).
  So, not a bad show and worth the time to sit down and enjoy.  Hopefully, season two will have more sub-plot development and a few more added twists and turns.  So watch and enjoy, as I have.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilot/dp/B0042K4ZZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilot</a>",1289520000,,835,5.17910447761194
4195593,1,B003UD7JEE,"I can't stand Shane West as Michael, he was completely miscast for this show. He just seem for me like a really bad actor. I won't pay a penny to see him acting at all. I don't know why they didn't bring back the creator of the LFN the same one that did 24 hours. Maggie looks so fragile that she can break just trying to hit somebody. I like fantasy, but she is way to much, I can't believe her performance at all. And no, real La Femme Nikita fans don't like this show, we hate it.",1289174400,7,483,3.938775510204082

4195595,1,B003UD7JEE,"The original Nikita was cool. The Nikita with Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis was very, very cool. This Nikita is so far below those productions that it seems very amateurish , like it was put together  by a junior high school class as a film project. After watching for a half hour, I had to quit . I felt nothing for any of the characters, and was kind of hoping they would all shoot each other and it would finally be over. I don't write many reviews ,but if I can save just one innocent person from the anguish of watching this video I know that Heaven will reward me.",1288310400,12,567,4.154545454545454

4195597,5,B003UD7JEE,"I wasn't sure that I'd like the new Nikita. I've seen every version of the original story - the original movie, the Bridget Fonda version and the Peta Wilson series. I thought telling the story again would be boring, but so far this show is anything but boring.

Maggie Q is a great Nikita. She is dangerous. She is beautiful, and she has this darkness inside of her that makes you feel sorry for the little girl who had been abused.

Seeing Melinda Clark take over Madeline's roll was a delight too. I can't think of anyone better for the part.

The only reinvention I'm not sure about yet is Michael, but I'll give it time. Shane West is a good actor, but he doesn't have that cold lizard quality the other Michaels did.

All in all, I'll be watching this every week, and I'll more than likely be buying a season pass too.",1284595200,4,824,4.3311688311688314
4195648,2,B003UD7JEE,"This modern, cookie-cutter, girls-kick-a**-and-nothing-else-matters attempt at entertainment will appeal to women who have been brainwashed into believing that 115lb females can indeed break the neck of a 240lb man in an instant, and to men who have been cowered into believing that the only way they will ever get sex is to dress shabbily and fully embrace the same illusion that some women have bought in to.

Guys, Man Up! Women are flowers, and men are sunshine. Women naturally gravitate to the power of the sun (or whatever they mistakenly believe is the sun) to be informed as how to grow. They need men, not to tell them what to do, but to shine the light on the way forward. That's all they need. They can do the rest.

So stop acting like a bunch of pansies gentlemen. Take off your pink colored glasses and realize that this is a very weak production of the Nikita story. Stop being led around by the notion that this version of Nikita is what women want to be. Women don't know what they really want, they just know what they've been told they want. Women were incredibly powerful creatures long before Hollywood tapped into their doubt about this fact and started presenting the superficial lie that all women can now physically kick all men's butts. Have you ever thought about what pressure young women are put under with this whole notion that if you're not drop-dead gorgeous and a karate champ then they're not a fully realized woman?

Think! That's not where true female power lies. So men, stop posting the kind of girlie-man reviews that you are for this series and others that follow this mold. Stop following and start leading. It starts by STOP believing everything you've been told for the last generation or two about men and women. It starts by recognizing the true strengths of each gender. Discover this for yourself. Investigate. Listen to your instincts. Read a book. For example, read 'The Way of The Superior Man' (which is NOT about men being superior to women, btw).

If you insist on a girls-kick-a** and make good assassins series, then go back and watch the 1997 La Femme Nikita series. It at least has cohesive story lines, good acting, and an actress in the lead who doesn't look like she can't open a car door without pulling a muscle. All elements missing in this 2010 glossy, formulated, ripoff attempt at spoon feeding the propagandized masses by those who care of nothing but feeding their egos and pocketbooks.",1493510400,5,2456,4.731308411214953

I loved the movie and the main character Nikita is stunningly beautiful but when I compare this with Alias....and the original Nikita movie not the American Version blah just horrible but the European version. I just hate it. I can't relate to any of the characters and the acting and overall casting is just meh.  Some of the situations are just so unbelievable that I can't look past how bad it is. Too bad.

4195750,5,B003UD7JEE,"Great series, Nikita has it all. Though Maggie Q had been in earlier flicks, I fell in love with her in MI3 and Live Free or Die Hard. When this series was first announced I couldn't wait for it to air. Maggie Q is, IMO, fabulous in her role as a trained assassin gone rogue, and on a mission. The other main and supporting actors also do extremely well in creating characters you will either love or hate, or, in some cases, can't make up your mind because you really aren't quite sure whose side they are really on. One of the great features about the series is that most of the episodes are self contained, though all of them build upon each other, including the use of flashbacks, to further develop characters and plots and sub-plots (of which there are several). There is plenty of action to satisfy virtually anyone. Definitely recommended to those who are fans of Maggie Q, action/adventure, espionage and intrigue.",1440979200,4,923,4.6

4195755,5,B003UD7JEE,"I'm a Nikita nut (Thank you Luc Besson).  I started with Point of No Return (ok) then saw Luc Besson's original French sub titled Nikita.  Then I had to watch the Canadian one developed by Joel Surnow (24, Nowhere Man) with Peta Wilson.  Then I found this and I love Maggie Q (Live Free or Die Hard, Divergent, Insurgent, MI3, etc.) and I love Melinda Clarke (Firefly, CSI -- so played a PRO in both) and there's Shane West (remake of Oceans 11 -- card playing actor) and Xander Berkeley (last booth).  Once again a great cast.  Xander is just as spooky, loveable and hatable as Glazer was in La Femme Nikita.  Clarke was just as vicious as Watson in the Peta Wilson show.  This was developed by Craig Silverstein (Standoff, TURN, Terra Nova, Bones) with McG backing.  The pilot is a knockout (especially Maggie in the Jacuzzi sequence).  It's a more formatted show than the Peta Wilson TV offering but for spy and Nikita fans you can't go wrong.  Alberta Watson was brought in by the second season as an oversight type person (she was in the Peta Wilson show as well).  This takes place AFTER Nikita gets out.  As opposed to the Peta Wilson version where she's in all the time.",1438214400,8,1178,4.47887323943662

4195770,5,B003UD7JEE,"Back in the day, I was a fan of Alias (actually, I wouldn't mind rewatching that show), so naturally I heard the comparisons to La Femme Nikita.  While I was interested, I never watched the original movie or the TV show version of the story.  But when the CW debuted a remake called simply Nikita in 2010, I decided to give it a chance.  By the end of the pilot, I was intrigued and by the end of the second episode, I was hooked.  I stayed that way the entire way through season one.

By the time she was a teenager, Nikita (Maggie Q) was already on death row.  But instead of being executed, she was recruited by Division, a secret organization inside the US government.  She was trained to be a spy and assassin.  But when she made the mistake of falling in love and revealing her secret to her fiance, Division had him killed.  And so Nikita escaped and vowed to take them down.

The series actually picks up three years after those events.  Nikita has started to move against Division.  She heads out to counteract their missions as much as she can.  That often means she is going directly against Michael (Shane West) a former friend who might have been more.  Percy (Xander Berkeley), the director of Division, is not at all pleased.  Computer expert Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford) can't figure out how she is always one step ahead of them.

The answer to that is Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca), a young lady who Division has just recruited.  What no one knows is that Alex is a plant, trained by Nikita to infiltrate Division and help her take them down.  Alex has her own reasons for doing this, reasons she is hiding from all her new co-workers.  Only Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist, suspects that Alex is not the top new recruit she appears to be.  Can Alex keep her secret?  Will Nikita find a way to take Division down?

I started watching this show despite the fact that I swore off serialized stories this year.  Of course, this show isn't serialized in the way that some shows I've watched in the past years have been.  Yes, there are on-going stories that move forward each week.  However, each episode features a main mission that is resolved by the time the episode is over.  There's enough to keep you coming back, but you don't have to keep track of every minute detail along the way.

And let me tell you, this show has plenty of suspense.  I often found myself on the edge of my seat trying to figure out how the characters would get out of the particular mess they had made that episode.  And as the series progresses, the stakes just get higher.  Between the two, I didn't want to miss a moment during the last half of the season.

One thing I liked is that they didn't try to milk their set up for too long.  They actually switched things around part way through before it stretched credibility too far.  And some twists in the last half showed that the writers are actually thinking and creating believable characters and not focusing on plot first.

Each episode also features flashbacks, usually focusing on Nikita or Alex.  Those flashbacks help us further understand the characters and a bit of the action of that week's show.  My only real complaint of the season involves these flashbacks, however.  Part way through, they give Alex a back story that just seemed out of left field.  Maybe there were hints I just missed early on in the season, but even so, I wish they hadn't gone where they did with her character.

The acting is great with not a weak performance in the bunch.  Maggie Q has been criticized for being too wooden, but I think she's perfect for a woman who has been very scarred by the work she's done over the years.  I believe every note of her performance, including the times she does have to get emotional.  And boy can she deliver on the action scenes.  But the standout is Melinda Clarke as Amanda.  That woman is pure evil, and Melinda captures that perfectly.  She is definitely a character you love to hate.
I have heard some people complain about the changes to the show from the originals or even that they are remaking this story.  Since I haven't seen any of the originals, I can't comment on that; maybe coming to this series fresh is a good thing.  All I can tell you is if you are willing to give this show a fair chance, you will quickly get hooked.

Season one consisted of 22 episodes, and you'll find them all here in their widescreen and full surround glory.  And there are extras.  We've got commentaries on two episodes, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and some behind the scenes featurettes that talk about how the creators tweaked things for this version of the story and how they put together an episode.

Believe me, once you get started, you'll find yourself hooked on season one of Nikita.",1432339200,,4768,4.505250875145857

4195772,5,B003UD7JEE,"I found this one better than the old La Fem Nikita.  It's a little more plausible than the old one where the agents were killed fairly frequently.  Basically, it's a spy who got out, got a double agent inside, and then works to bring them down.  It's out there and not really very plausible, but it's a lot of fun.  Looks great on a high def TV even without the Bluray players.  I have an upscaling DVD player and the picture is wonderful.  Good set.",1431993600,,450,4.235294117647059

4195797,5,B003UD7JEE,"I'm a hard guy to sell to. Call me old-fashioned, but very seldomly do I see any TV shows on today that I REALLY want to watch. That's why I usually just watch a bunch of retro TV shows. . . Nikita is hands down the BEST TV show I've had the pleasure of seeing within the last decade. I love this show, because it does great story-telling. I mean it seems like every episode, actor and company gives it their all. I mean this is my mother's favorite TV show, it's the only thing she won't fall asleep on. I'm more of a walking dead fan, and I prefer to watch walking dead over this purely because I love zombies and apocalyptic stories, and of course the characters. But I'm sorry, I cannot honestly say in my heart of hearts that the walking dead is better than Nikita. If anything, I hate to admit the vice versa.

Really, everything from the acting to the writing to the directing to the lighting to the sound is simply top-notch. Everything clicks so well, which is surprising to say the least, because of their low budget. Due to their low budget, and not enough advertising/marketing, the show was canceled. So tragic.

In a nutshell, Nikita has everything a person would want, it touches the human heart and mind, as well as other genres. It's definitely not short on any action, its comedic, it has a dramatic side, its suspenseful, its a thriller, its adventurous, its sci-fantasy. Falls short of horror, but man, talk about leaving no stone unturned.",1424390400,3,1460,4.484962406015038

Just ordered the three other seasons of Nikita. Season one has arrived and i'm watching it now. This is one of the best T.V. series that I have ever seen.

4195823,5,B003UD7JEE,"Initially it is hard not to be reminded of Joss Whedon's Dollhouse with lots of fit young things doing James Bond training stuff in some secret bunker while Nikita and Alex the mole disrupt the grown-ups' missions. It is, of course, all very silly but that really doesn't matter as fortunately the plot develops very quickly and you get drawn into the shadowy (though somewhat improbable) world of Division's shenanigans. Every elegantly produced episode is neatly designed around plot and character development with some fighting and stuff going bang thrown in for good measure; it is excellently written coherent, slick, flashy and fast paced top-notch entertainment. It doesn't do to think too much - just disengage those higher cognitive functions and enjoy the ride.",1420934400,,771,5.225806451612903

Maggie Q, Shane West, Aaron Stanford and Melinda Clarke are very well cast in their roles, and are at the top of their game.  Lyndsy Fonseca as Alex isn't as good; she may improve with more experience, one supposes.",1399852800,,390,4.893939393939394
4195858,5,B003UD7JEE,"This is the latest incarnation of La Femme Nikita (which has consisted of the original French film, the TV series that ran on the USA network years ago and the Bridget Fonda movie Point of No Return) tells the story of an assassin here played by the gorgeous Maggie Q, who is attempting to bring down the rouge black op organization called Division that she used to work for. she is aided by a recruit she planted in Division named Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) and essentially disrupts mission after mission.

Each episode has a mission of the week flavor to it, but within that there are several overarching story lines (mainly that flesh out the backgrounds of the main characters). There is a lot that goes on story wise, and the cast is a very large ensemble. The three main characters are definitely Nikita, Alex and Michael (the agent that trains the recruits for Division). After that are Percy (played by Xander Berkley who is probably best known for his role in the early seasons of 24) and Amanda (played by Melinda Clarke from The OC). The other characters kind of rotate throughout the season. If the ""main"" characters the only two we really do not know much about in terms of their backgrounds are Percy and Amanda.

The show has a lot of action, but it does not rely on just action or the looks of the main characters (although Maggie Q is put in some skimpy outfits throughout the season much like Jennifer Garner was in Alias) to get by. There are a lot of well done stories and all the actors do a great job with their characters. There are a lot of twists and turns throughout the season and by the end of season 1 the show is in a very different place than it was when it started. That definitely helped keep the show from getting too repetitive which can easily happen with this kind of series.

For those who get the actual discs, the A/V quality of the blu rays is great as you would expect. A nice touch is that the series will play in a season play mode so you can stop in the middle of an episode and pick back up where you left off. As far as extras go, there are deleted scenes on every disc and the fourth disc has several behind the scenes features that tell the making of the story and short character bio vignettes. There is also commentary available on some of the episodes. So if you like going through the extras there is a substantial amount there.

While liking any kind of series like this is pretty subjective, if you are a fan of the genre overall, it it definitely worth checking out.",1399593600,,2517,4.383297644539614

Every episode is its own action movie full of thrilling fast paced movement and drama. You will be on the edge of your seat.
This underrated series was even able to get full story closure in a shortened fourth season (6 episodes). So you do not lose anything for watching this series to the end.

I won't say this is great television, or even good television, it's okay. The last few episodes of this season are where you gets your moneys worth. After a loooooong set up, involving a slew of characters introduced for the very purpose of later disposing of carelessly the series finally gets good. Hopefully going into the next season the producers will have realized that a grand narrative arc is important in telling a story like this and we'll see an end to the procedural type show this begins as.

4195882,1,B003UD7JEE,"Seriously, I hated Alias (which a lot of people say this show is like).  Alias came after La Femme Nikita (by the writers of ""24"").  La Femme Nikita was one of the first hit shows on a 'cable' network to have a huge fan following.  This show is very poorly written as was Alias.  I don't understand why so many people eat up the utter garbage that is on tv today.  Even though by now some of the tech shown on La Femme Nikita is a bit dated, the fashion was way ahead of its time as were the actors.  If I were you I would forget bothering with this series entirely and go back to the original tv adaptation of the French film (that was later adapted in America in Point of No Return).  If you are seriously a real Nikita character fan then no one played her like Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis' rendition of Michael cannot be surpassed.  The Micheal in the 'Nikita' series is horrendously cliche, over-the-top and horrible.  But, again, if you love Alias you will certainly love the garbage writing in this reboot series as well.",1387670400,10,1026,4.302083333333333
4195883,5,B003UD7JEE,"I'll admit that when I first heard of a remake in the Nikita series I was a little worried.  But once I watched the first episode I was hooked from beginning to end.  This has everything that we want in a spy tv series.  It is action-packed, sexy, awesome, and just filled with tons of excitement.

First off, the characters are amazing!  Maggie Q does a great job as non other than ""Nikita"" herself.  I just love this character.  She is beautiful and sexy (in her own way) and also deadly.  I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.  We also have Michael, who I swear has a great voice.  This guy just has authority when he speaks, no one can ignore him.  And he also has extreme ways of being a spy.  But he does have a soft side, if you have the means of getting to it.  Next we have Alex.  Trust me when I say it, this girl is not who she seems to be.  There are a lot of twists and turns with her.  She is very convincing and very smart.  This one is definitely not to be trifled with.  And then we have the villains of this story.  Percy is, by far, a great villain.  He is threatening in all sorts of ways.  When he gives a threat, he ""really"" means it.  Heck, we even see him snap a guy's neck (spoilers).  You can tell that this guy is angry, even when he is smiling or not.  Last, we have Amanda.  Okay, I do have some problems with this villain, but in the end she is still a great villain, I just think Percy is better.  She is very deadly in her torturing methods (again spoilers) and can even put a chill down your spine.  You can tell that a dark history lies deep in her past, which makes her even more interesting.  What can I say, these characters are amazingly done.

The storyline of this season is completely done with fast-pacing, right acting, great action, awesome twists and turns, great excitement, and also lots of amazing moments that really leave you wanting more.  I've always loved the idea of a secret organization that moves in the shadows and uses the government to their advantage.  It's like the ultimate storyline that can be used.  Jason Bourne came close, but it was missing the whole secret organization type of thing.  Division is that type of storyline that we are looking for and it fits the bill.  And I just love the idea of a highly trained assassin trying to take it down.  That is where Nikita comes in.  I love how the secrecy just plays such an amazing role in this season, allowing us to feel the excitement and the heart-pounding question of ""what will happen next?"".  The action is done very well and the pacing is just right.

I understand that some people don't like how this new series is done, compared to the old one.  But if you really think about it, there is nothing this series can do what the original series has already done.  It can't beat the old series or ruin it, because it has already a great series and nothing can change that, not even this series.  Besides, this is a new take on the legend of ""Nikita"" and it fits really well.  We need to come up with new ideas to do a new version, not redo it.  If you love the old series, that's great.  If you love this series, awesome.  There is nothing bad about it.

I say that this series is worth a good look at.  Buy it!",1387411200,2,3235,4.202283849918434

IMO there is no comparison between this version and either of the other versions of Nikita which I have already mentioned.  It just doesn't ring true and the relationships among the characters don't seem genuine; as a viewer I am not drawn in with this version of Nikita and have rarely found the action scenes that exciting.  To the credit of the writers and producers they did change the story line totally in an attempt to keep people from continuously comparing this version to LaFemme Nikita.  I do not recommend this version of Nikita; a much better choice for casting, writing, directing and acting for action/thriller fans is LaFemme Nikita available through amazon.com.",1385769600,2,949,4.943396226415095

Many of the characters are just as compelling, but some of the differences throw off the balance of the show - and the overall theme of season one (Percy and the black boxes) is too over simplified in comparison to the 'original' show.

That said, the show definitely had it's moments, and I did enjoy watching it through the first season.  ""Ask me how I got here"".",1385769600,,494,4.655172413793103

4195910,5,B003UD7JEE,"This is perhaps the greatest spy-vs-spy storytelling ever to hit the small screen.  Action, drama, romance, comedy, and fast-paced plotlines are all part of the package here.  It's held together by a deadly beautiful assassin called Nikita who's trying to climb out of a sinful past of soul-damning acts by turning on the secret government agency that created her.

Sinister conflict and great fight scenes are part of most episodes, but it is the strong characters and superb storytelling that made the first season such a success.  Maggie Q plays Nikita with great heart and charisma, but she is well-backed by the other female lead Lyndsy Fonseca who plays her younger partner-in-espionage Alex.  The cast is rounded out by other solid actors, with each having well-developed characters that we get to know over time.

With heroines and heroes to cheer for and villains to hate, this show is a lot of fun to watch.  There are some nice twists and turns along the way, and the pacing is fairly fast throughout.  By the time we reach the season finale, it gets to be a bit of a dizzying ride but is well worth the journey.",1385510400,4,1123,4.723076923076923

4195913,5,B003UD7JEE,"I have watched only part of ""Nikita"" but have been amazed at the profound truths it touches upon. Back in 1958, I was drafted into the US Army & after being tested was recruited into their Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). During those years I was was an atheist, but even though I did not believe in God or ""good & evil"" I was nevertheless appalled at the amorality of the CIC. The perfect recruit would be someone who was completely dead to all  of God's image that is in man - caring, compassion, love, sensitivity to what is truly ""right"" & ""wrong,"" righteousness, integrity, etc. I think of those I have seen on TV convicted of murder who are without any remorse at all - calmly discussing the heinous murders they have committed without a tinge of sorrow or sadness or pain of memory. Christians are called upon to ""die"" to all that is not of God in their lives. Those who participate in the ""Division"" in ""Nikita"" are urged to die to all that is of God's image in their lives. Nikita herself cannot do so & so becomes a ""rogue"" - just as Christians are called upon by their God to become an ""alien"" in this world. Tears of sorrow have come to my eyes as I have contemplated how mankind has perverted the image of Himself that God placed in us - & how we have turned from our true God-given destiny.",1382659200,,1305,4.326530612244898

4195953,5,B003UD7JEE,"I have to admit: this show COMPLETELY took me by surprise! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this show while seemingly searching in vain for something to watch on Netflix. We, like many of the other users of the site, DEVOUR television series like it's our job. It was my turn to select what we were going to watch and I was fighting to start Damages. My boyfriend resisted and I handed over controller to him and he landed on Nikita. I was initially wary of the show. I had seen promos for it in the CW while watching Supernatural and it was always one of those shows I INTENDED to watch, but never got around to. About to push it aside again, my boyfriend persisted and we began watching the first episode. By the time it ended the two of us were sitting forward in our seats and when the credits began to roll we turned to each other, mouths open.

This show is action packed almost from the very first moments until the end. The first few episodes are lacking some humor, but a third of the way into the series they realize this and it becomes even more enjoyable. I can not believe that I ever resisted this show. It has been one of the only shows that causes my boyfriend and I to yell in reaction to something or scream in frustration when something goes wrong. We are now completely caught up and watching the third season each week and PRAYING it gets renewed for a fourth. This is a series that keeps getting better and better with age. Just when we think that the writers can't possibly think of something new, they do and it's AMAZING.

By the third season, the core group of characters are wonderful and blend in well together. This is definitely a show that I intend to watch until the very end. I honestly hope it gets a few more seasons. If you are on the fence about this show, just jump. Watch it. The first few episodes are a little shaky, but believe me, the rest of the series more than makes up for it!

4195954,3,B003UD7JEE,"Forget this series and check out ""Continuum"".

Like most of these over-produced action television shows, ""Nikita"" is good viewing for 10-15 episodes before the boredom factor sets in and you struggle to focus long enough to watch another episode in its entirety.  The original female assassin concept was good enough to justify several versions and Maggie Q is the best of those who have played some version of this title character.

Maggie's Nikita is an oddly interesting characterization, normally dimensionality is a good thing.  But here she is easy to take in one dimension and when she starts to show some vulnerability or complexity it just doesn't seem plausible.

One thing I enjoy are the fantasy scenes with Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) and her younger self (Eliana Jones). There is a physical resemblance but Jones is a talented actress while the struggling Fonseca is quite painful to watch.  Watching them together the surreal talent disparity makes you wonder if someday they will account for it by disclosing that Alex suffered brain damage at age 15.

Overall, the sophistication level is extremely low, too low to work as an extended engagement.  Like most of these silly things each episode is another moronic ""deus ex machina"" ending just waiting to happen.  Apparently the writers and the target audience (at least the one their writing has built) are just not clever enough for a more sophisticated plot device.  Good grief, Edwin S. Porter made his ""Life of an American Fireman"" short in 1902 for the Edison Manufacturing Company. One of the earliest American narrative films, it depicts the rescue of a woman and child from a burning building, and does so with more suspense and a whole lot less narrative cheating than your standard ""Nikita"" episode.",1364947200,2,1769,5.027397260273973

4195972,5,B003UD7JEE,"""Nikita"" is a very enjoyable series that has kept us engaged with clever plots, decent acting, and great action. We tend to watch series after they have been out for a season or two (mostly to be sure we don't get drawn into something the is going to be cancelled mid-plot) and started on Nikita after the second season.

No plot spoilers from me: The story follows Nikita (Maggie Q), a very skilled assassin trained by a secret government agency called ""Division"". Unfortunately for Division, Nikita has gone rouge and is working hard to bring the agency down. There is more to this series than fighting, blowing things up, and assassinations, since the personal relationships between the various agents become key to understanding the past (which is slowly relieved) and developing plot lines.

This is one of the best in this genre!

Highly Recommended!

4195974,5,B003UD7JEE,"Having seen the Luc Besson original movie, it's Americanized Brigette Fonda remake and the Peta Wilson TV series, I think this show is the best variation on the Nikita legend.

Maggie Q is so sexy as well as dangerous as Nikita, a drug addict pulled from death row by a shadowy government arm called Division to be an assassin in their organization. Shane West is cast as a great Michael, a fellow Division agent tasked with stopping Nikita at all cost even though the two shared an intimate history, Aaron Stanford  stars as Birkoff, Division resident computer hacker and Lyndsy Fonseca does a great job as Alex, a new recruit placed in Division by Nikita to help her bring Division down from the inside. Melinda Clarke has never been sexier than her role as the diabolical Amanda, Division's second in command and Xander Berkeley as the equally evil Percy heads Division and rounds out this great ensemble.

Unlike the other Nikita variants, this one explores how long Division's reach is as Nikita rushes to shut down all of Percy's side operations as well as Alex on the inside feeding her intel.

This show also focuses on Alex's training and how she gets along with her fellow recruits as she learns friendships don't last in Division.

Another plot twist I like is Nikita having knowledge of Percy's Black boxes containing information on every black op job Division did for it's government and the names of the people in the government who sanctioned the missions and the ""Guardians"" protecting them.

So it's safe to say more ground has been covered in this first season alone of Nikita than the five years La Femme Nikita was on the air.

The storyline is amazing. The cinematography is unbelievable and the scripting and direction are so cool. If you have not seen this show, you really should try it and what better place to start than here.",1358208000,3,1852,4.732919254658385

The production value is very high, but strip all the hoopla away and the dialogue is predictable, mundane, and high-school.
Without the Alex character (I could watch Fonseca knit for an hour and not get bored), I would not have gotten as far through it as I did. Thus the 2nd star. In the end, I could stand no more and put it back on the shelf before finishing the season. The only other TV show I've done that with is ""Miracles"".

The stories are good, the plots are great, and the action is fantastic.  That said, I don't know why Division has so much trouble with Nikita.  Yeah, she causes trouble for the diabolical and power hungry Percy, and sabotages Division's missions, then escapes their clutches at the end of every episode.  However, if Division really wanted to capture Nikita, it's not that difficult.  As all us avid TV action series viewers know, CTU answers to Division and the director of Division could easily order CTU to hunt down and capture or terminate that pesky Nikita.  Now we know Nikita is good, but she's no match for Jack Bauer!  In fact, the dude now heading Division was sent to take over CTU several years ago and saved Jack Bauer's life by flying a nuclear bomb into the desert where it detonated away from a populated area, so Jack owes him a favor, which could be repaid by catching Nikita.  However, that could cause more problems for Division as Bauer is now a fugitive from the U.S. government and being a rogue agent himself, may collaborate with Nikita in her endeavors.  Team Nikita-Bauer would then be unstoppable.  What takes Nikita months to accomplish, Jack Bauer could do in just 24 hours.

4196074,1,B003UD7JEE,"I was a massive fan of the original TV series adapted from Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita. LFN (the series from 1997) was edgy, dark, and ahead of the times. I've watched a couple of episodes of CW's Nikita and can't get into it. It's both too much like the original series and too far from it at the same time. If you're going to take the exact same characters, keep them in character. Maggie Q's Nikita is a pixie that I don't believe could take down a child, much less a 250 pound baddie. Shane's Michael is admittedly cute, but Roy Dupuis brought so much depth to the character that I just can't see anyone else in that role.

If they'd based their series off the movie, then maybe I could have gotten into it, because it'd be different, way different, that my beloved LFN, but they didn't, and they've butchered some of the best characters on TV. The new Nikita's Michael and Nikita have no depth and romance to them, there's no electricity on screen. At least to me. And if this series is supposed to be based off the original hit series, then where exactly is Madeline or Walter? And why is the organization an American one, called Division and not Section One? And PERCY? Really? That's what fans called Operations before we found out his name was PAUL. CW you have failed in my eyes. You should have either definitively decided to either have stuck true to the original series, or to the movie, but you didn't and instead this 'new' series is a weird mishmash that doesn't know what it wants to be.",1321747200,20,1505,4.413669064748201
4196075,5,B003UD7JEE,This is one of the best shows i've seen in years. After the first episode i was hooked and with each new episode is a new adventure and a new twist. I strongly recommend that everyone give this series a shot. You won't be disappointed.,1321660800,2,235,4.2444444444444445
4196076,5,B003UD7JEE,"I really wanted to watch this show when it aired on tv but never got around to it, then it came out on blu-ray. I waited until a price drop before buying it, since I did not want to spend alot of cash on a show that could end up sucking. All I have to say is Im so glad I made the purchase. This show is awesome its takes place a couple of years after the movie. Nikita is plotting revenge on the agency she use to work for, over something they did to someone in her personal life( I do not wait to give away spoilers.) This show if I were to described it is like Jason Bourne, Salt, and Alias combined. When I watch the first episode I could not quit until I finished the disc, it was that addicting. The action and the way it is choreographed is awesome, the actors in the show are amazing as well. I cannot say enough good things about Maggie Q she is not only hot but she can also kicks some a@!. She does a great job of portraying a beautiful yet strong female character. The whole cast is great as well. I will say if you are a fan of spy-type espionage high action thrillers then this is a show for you. Please do not hesitant, buy it.",1318809600,3,1142,3.9695652173913043
4196077,5,B003UD7JEE,"Since he created the storyline back in 1990, the Luc Besson story of the young woman being converted into an assasin has had four treatments--Besson's own ""La Femme Nikita"", the Bridget Fonda vehicle known alternately as ""The Assassin"" and ""The Point Of No Return"" in 1992, the USA Network series of the late 1990s that starred Peta Wilson, and ""Alias"", which drew from the ""Nikita"" storyline in its five-year run.  Warner Brothers has loved the storyline, which is why it now gets its third treatment, this time on the CW.
  I mentioned ""Alias"" in the opening paragraph because, as the Jennifer Garner series drew from the ""Nikita"" legend, this version of the ""Nikita"" tale draws both from ""Alias"" and its television predecessor.  One could see this version drawing from the Peta Wilson series as sort of a continuation of the story it started back in the day, but the core motivation of this Nikita--to destroy the rogue black ops unit; ""Division"" in this piece because of the murder of her lover--draws from Sydney Bristow's desire to destroy SD6 in ""Alias""; with the protagonists even having their deceased lovers both named Daniel.
  This iteration of ""Nikita"" also follows ""Alias"" much more in terms of action--with 20/20 hindsight, ""LFN"" seems a precursor in terms of style and posing to ""The Matrix"".
  Of course, what really makes this version of the Nikita story take off...is Margaret Denise Quigley.
  If I start off by saying that Maggie Q is gorgeous, here's the reaction I would expect--
  ""You got THAT right...""
  ""Oh, really??!?  I didn't notice...""
  ""Well, DUH...""
  The fact that Maggie brings the action chops along with her beauty--she's a younger version of the great Michelle Yeoh in many ways--cannot be dismissed when this series is discussed.  She knows what she's doing in the action sequences, which adds to the watchability of the episodes.
  The supporting cast is very good.  Shane West's Michael is surly, mean, and a professional; stuck between his duty to Division and his attraction to Nikita.  Melinda Clarke's Amanda--the psychological operations specialist--is handled well, Clarke bringing some of her iciness and control from her ""Lady Heather"" character from ""CSI"" to Amanda.  Aaron Sanford's Birkoff is much more fun and snarky than Matthew Ferguson's take on the character from the USA series.  Because so much of this series happens within the training areas of Division, the two students--Ashton Holmes' hard-charging Thom and Tiffany Hines' unstable Jaden--are key in the season.  There cannot be enough said about Xander Berkeley's Percy, other than to call him ""Arvin Sloane on steroids"".  There is NO pretense of loyalty with Percy, and the snarl that Berkeley gives to him is done without quarter.
  This leads me to the key performance and character of the first season--Lyndsy Fonseca, and her turn as Nikita's friend/student/mole within Division, Alex.  Many of us know Fonseca as the nerdgasm from ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" or ""Kick-Ass"", obviously lighter fare.  The addition of Alex, and getting her placed within Division, initially starts off as an added part of Nikita's attempt to destroy the organization, but as the season goes on, we realize that there is more here--specifically, WHY Nikita chose Alex, and who Alex is, and her own relation to the sordid history of Division--especially Nikita's own past within Division.  In many ways, Alex's story becomes more intriguing to the season than what we consider the primary story.  It is an interesting and far more complicated load that Fonseca has ever had to carry, and Lyndsy pulls it off very well.
  Season 1 is very much an establishment of the two storylines and draws the lines in this battle--Nikita wanting Michael to help her bring down Division and his wavering between loyalty to Division and aiding Nikita, Nikita's loose group of people aiding her--the rogue ""Guardian"" Owen (Devon Sawa), the low-level CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean)...and Percy's designated hitman, the ""Cleaner"" only known as Roan (Rob Stewart, considerably cleaned up and toned down from his ""Sweating Bullets"" days).
  The guest turns here don't have a lot of big names--there is Ray Park's turn as a Guardian in ""Into The Box"", and seeing the long-time martial-arts artist and actor ply his craft here is a treat.  But the interesting casting comes in the season finale, ""Pandora"", which upsets the apple cart in setting up the storyline for Season Two.  The veteran actor Harris Yulin portrays a member of ""Oversight""--which controls (supposedly) Division--but more interesting is the casting of Alberta Watson to play another member of Oversight, Madeline.  For those who remember the cast of ""La Femme Nikita"" from the USA Network, Watson played the director of psychological ops in the Peta Wilson-led series...and yes, her character was named ""Madeline"".  One wonders if Danny Cannon and Craig Silverstein will play on this connection as the series continues.
  This take on the ""Nikita"" story is much more action driven, certainly closer to its ""Alias"" cousin in that regard than any of the true ""Nikita"" predecessors.  Maggie Q and Lyndsy Fonseca make it easy on the eyes to watch, but having McG directing the action--and Maggie's considerable skill in the action sequences--makes this series a kick.  Add in the subtle complications of the storyline, and the CW has a winner.
  Highly recommended.",1318723200,5,5412,5.117445838084379
4196098,5,B003UD7JEE,"If you are a die hard fan of the Original La Fem Nikita Film then the two American Re-Makes
Later the TV Series
You'll be both Surprised and Amazed what a great new take on the Nikita mythology this is!
It's Fresh and Smart

I was turned off Cause they seemed to have Marked it so wrong IMO
Trying to sell Sexuality over the deep Story
The CW isn't the only one to do this USA's Covert Affairs and Fairly Legal also were poorly Marked just on sex appeal
It's not fair to the 3 Stars of each show (Cause they all bring lots to the table)
Regardless I watched the pilot and it's One of the best Prime time Shows in a long time!

Maggie Q and Shane West Lead a True Perfect 5 Star Cast
Lyndsy Fonseca (Alex) is a great Find
she can hold her own side by side with Maggie Q
Xander Berkeley (Percy) is awesome as the guy you love to hate!
the story is very much different then the Previous tv Show
I guess you could compare it to Frank Miller's Dark Knight Graphic Novel
You are watching the second half of Nikita's Life after she escape Division
It takes various twists and turns (It 's more like a Day time Soap Opera Cause the story all fits together seamlessly
You have to watch every episode in order
The goal to the 1st Season is to Set up a Much bigger Season II

Season II has been great so far!

Former teen heartthrob  Devon Sawa has made a number of appearances and he was also wonderfully casted
as the Former Cleaner for Division who has also gone Rogue

The HQ of each episode is incredible
from the fight scenes,  Stuff Blowing up! all the extras they cast
It's like a mini movie each episode

I'd think at some point they will bring Peta Wilson in as a guest star

It's by far the Best Adult Drama on The CW  In many ways it doesn't fit on there Station)
But, I'm glad they picked it up and hope they stick with it for a few years and keep the quality coming
I highly recommend this Action/Drama it will not Disappoint anyone who loves and misses Great tv

4196103,5,B003UD7JEE,"Let me start by saying that I love this show. The acting is great for the most part. Resistance, Coup De Grace, Covenants, Betrayals and Pandora are the best episodes in my opinion. The writing is good. The plot twists revealed throughout the season had me giddy for the next revalation. The action sequences are well choreographed and look good. Xander Berkeley is great in his role as Percy. He plays it with a cool, calm demeanor perfectly. Maggie Q was born to play this type of role. She is great in the intense sequences. Shane West is great as well. Every actor is good in their own right. Those are just my personal picks. The show is great, and I look forward to the second season. The only problem I have is with the number of features, and a problem with disc 5. There is no gag reel for the DVD version. That is what I would have most wanted to see. I can live with that though as the show is amazing. A major problem though is that my 5th disc came with scratches already on it. I have had it for only three days now, and just used it on the second day and out of the box there were scratches. Another thing is the finale has a section that skips. In about the middle of the episode playback will just stop, and a few seconds later skip to further in the eppisode. This same thing happened on the first making of documentary. I just thought I would warn other customers about this. It could be due to the scratches, but I did not cause them so it could be on all of the 5th discs in this set. Thanks for reading. I hope that I helped in your decision making.",1315180800,5,1571,4.171052631578948

4196118,5,B003UD7JEE,"I didn't expect much out of Nikita but I was wrong. Nikita is now the new 24, and Maggie Q the new Kiefer Sutherland. Expect intelligent plots, hairpin twists, and conveniently advanced technology, in a spy-v-spy drama that is light on the violence porn and heavy on characterization and humanity - all done while basically looking supermodel-esque fabulous.

My friends are -not- going to believe I just wrote that sentence. But Nikita deserves it.

I also appreciate the very international nature of the plot, with backdrops from Santiago to Tashkent, and spoken languages in the show from Cantonese (Maggie's is legit, Percy's is wince-inducing) to Russian (Maggie's sounds 100% legit, perhaps Russian-speakers can chime in on this). So good to see real EFFORT in TV these days.

Absolutely buy/rent/watch/whatever. Oh and once you have watched it you might appreciate the similarities this drama has with Harry Potter - Percy has 7 horcruxes which all must be destroyed before he can be killed, and the characters discuss how killing somebody takes away bits of your soul/stays with you.

To be honest, I had expected that ""Nikita"" would turn out to be just another piece of CW fluff.  Instead, I was rather pleasantly surprised.  The writing is good, although a bit delusional in a teen-age fantasy sort of way.  The cast is very strong, however, and even when I am not entirely enamored of the plot, I find that half-way through the story I still want to stick around to discover how things turn out,and to root for my favorite bad guy, Xander Berkeley. This version of ""Nikita"" is not as paranoid delusional as the Peta Wilson version, or especially the two films on the subject (""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Point of No Return""), but it's fun and engaging, and that's more than you can say about 99 percent of what passes for scripted television, these days.",1307750400,7,945,4.508771929824562
4196121,5,B003UD7JEE,"One of the best new shows to come out of the CW, although it did take a while to grow on me. It actually has a strong pilot and there's nothing you could call actively bad about the first few episodes, but I must admit that it wasn't really must-watch tv fo me at first either. This all changes at about midway through the season when the writers start piling on the twists, and you are left on the edge of your seat every episode. I'd say the episode when Nikita gets trapped in Division is when the show really goes from good to great

An absolute must-watch overall, and I've got my fingers crossed for some great extras as the three leads all seem very appreciative of the fans, and I'm sure they would love to do commentaries and take part in interviews discussing how it all got started etc. I would love commentaries featuring all three leads, so I really hope someone someone considers asking them as I know that Maggie especially as a lot of imput into the show, and would surely love to do something like that for the fans

My one quipple is that I'm not very keen on the cover! It'a a bit too sexualised for my tastes, and I would feel awkward buying something like that from stores to be honest, or asking for it for a gift. That might just be my own hang-ups, but I know that Maggie wasn't thrilled either with the sexed-up bikini shots from the pilot, so I wish they could use a picture that shows off a litte less thigh...

No complaints otherwise though, and I've already planning to ask for this boxset for a Christmas gift (with hopes of the cover art not causing to many raised eyebrows among my relatives LOL)",1306886400,4,1629,4.316993464052287

Maggie Q as Nikita is amazing, from her fantastic martial art skills (which she is so humble about) to the captivating emotion of Nikita's life inside and out of Division while she is rogue.
Shane West as the stoic Division agent Michael has brought new levels this character never had before. West expresses the deep emotions his complex character is feeling with one look.
Lysdny Fonseca plays the tortured Alexandra Udivof with such a heart wrenching story you would swear she was Anastasia.

The cast as a whole (mention to) Melinda Clarke, Aaron Standford, Xander Berkley - great.
Melinda plays the chilling and sinister Amanda nicknamed 'The Inquisitor'
Aaron Standford is the surly and newly improved 2010 Birkhoff or 'nerd' as Nikita calls him, his wit and mannerisms make you crave the whole ensemble of the cast!
Xander Berkely the head of Division, Percy, with little regard for human life and much for power and control.

This season was an amazing start and is only the beginning.

With two beautiful lead actresses (Maggie Q and Lyndsy Fonseca) along with a cool leading man (Shane West), the show definitely has characters you want to root for.  In addition, the show also has 2 extremely compelling villains in Percy (Xander Berkley) and Amanda, played by the beautiful and sexy Melinda Clarke.  Awesome action sequences, martial arts fight chereography...what more can you ask for?

As good as the episodes are, when you get to the last few episodes of the first season, you then have revealed to you how so many things that you previously saw were woven together in incredible plots by multiple people or groups in their own directions or interests.

Every episode of Nikita is so well written and satisfying - every fight scene so well choreographed - and the chemistry between Nikita and Michael is so intense. The show has shocked me, thrilled me, gave me ""OMG"" moments and kept me waiting to see what would happen next. I will be so sad to see a show of this caliber canceled.

Back in September critics hailed it as one of the season's best new shows, and that is what caused me to give it a try.  Since episode one I have been totally hooked!  I can't believe that the CW has already renewed 90210 and the rapidly declining Gossip Girl, but not Nikita!  I watch all three of these shows, but Nikita is by far my favorite, and the only one I would be particularly sad to see cancelled.  It has everything you would want in a show - action, romance, mystery, a solid backstory, suspense, passion, and humor!  It really is unlike any other show on TV right now.  I hate to see it get lost in a sea of cop shows, forensics shows, reality shows, and primetime soap operas.  So many shows today are procedural, where you can skip episodes and still know exactly what's going on when you return.  Nikita is the first show in a while to keep me hanging on the edge of my seat week after week.  So much happens in every episode; you wouldn't want to miss one!  It kind of breaks my heart that the ratings are not where they need to be... And I worry that it will be hard for Nikita to pick up new viewers because it's the kind of show where you really want to start at the beginning of season one rather than tuning in late.  On the plus side, full episodes are available on Hulu.com, so new viewers can catch up there before season two (hopefully!!) premieres in the fall.  If you have never watched, I implore you to do so immediately!!

My wife and I gave up watching some of the other CW fare, like Vampire Diaries. That's a series caught in an endless and boring loop. Maybe we're in the ""Too-Long-In-The-Tooth"" demographic to appreciate some of these programs, but Nikita is an exception. Having come of age during the Cold War, I like Nikita for the nice, old Spy vs. Spy/James Bondian feel, the 50s and 60s cloak 'n dagger stories, framed in new technology. It also has a bit of the 1940s noir feel, too. Both female characters are sympathetic and likable, as well as being fine athletes and potent martial artists. I was also pleased to see the ""thing"" between Nikita and Michael come to fruition. So many scripts drag out the love connection and sexual tension and never come to any conclusion. ABC's Castle looks like its going that direction with its principals. The writers seem to be developing the characters in Nikita, and that makes them fun to watch. They change, they grow.

The acting is ok.  It can be a little dramatic at times, but this show is fun to watch, so I can easily overlook the sometimes cheesy acting.
Probably the most unbelievable thing is that Maggie Q is supposed to be super tough, but she's so skinny!  Otherwise, she's great, and works well as Nikita.",1301875200,,618,4.482142857142857

4196156,5,B003UD7JEE,"This is a great new rendition of the old show.

The cast is very suited to have you invest in the characters.

The writer keeps you coming back for more.

The show reminds me of a more comic book style Jack Bauer meets Sydney Bristow type of story.

Nikita is a show I'd spend hours watching over again. Definitely worth buying.",1298851200,2,328,4.327868852459017

He's perfect for the role. Detached, a prick, but with a bit of a soft spot for his protege. And you want to kill him off? Not handsome enough for you? For the record, I'm a straight guy who thinks he's handsome as hell. As for Nikita, she so friggin gorgeous I don't care if her beanpole figure suspends belief in her fighting abilities. Love the show.",1298246400,2,435,4.382716049382716

4196169,4,B003UD7JEE,"'Nikita' is a fast moving, action packed series that garners glimpses of the back-stories and personalities of pertinent characters. This PG-13 conspiracy thriller surprises, mysteriously holds back, and smoothly slips snippets of dry humor into unexpected moments. Nikita operates from a damaged but determined and focused point of view. This is a strong woman who does not depend on her sexuality, but who is also not averse to pulling it out of her bag of tricks as a means to an end. She will bring these bastions down! She once was one of them, and retains slightly mixed affections towards certain individuals, but that will not stop her quest. Those affections go both ways. Will Michael(her ex-handler), or will he not, turn and aid her in her objective? On the other hand, might one of them kill the other? Alex, embedded within the enemy's lair, is Nikita's loyal cohort, collaborating in the ultimate conspiracy to tear down this gargantuan abuse of government power. Xander Berkeley embodies soul-less evil as Percy, the Director. Furthermore, the lovely psychiatrist, employed by Percy, is also the interrogator/ torturer. Hmmm...? The story is just complicated enough to keep it very interesting. This is a new Nikita, not a remake. Watch and enjoy!",1295654400,,1263,5.106280193236715
4196170,4,B003UD7JEE,Enjoyed La Femme Nikita for what it was.  Enjoy Nikita for what it is.  It's a totally different show and I really appreciate a woman who can actually do her own stunts and take guys down.  It's great to see Maggie Q doing this show and I love Shane West.  The writing is getting better as the show continues so I really appreciate that a full season was ordered.  Can't wait until it's back in a few weeks.,1294531200,2,407,4.166666666666667
4196171,5,B003UD7JEE,"Nikita is a great and entertaining show. I find the show has a little bit of romance, action, comedy, family, and more. Maggie Q is great as a kick ass spy and Shane West is absolutely scrumptious as Michael! Can't wait for the next season!!",1294444800,,241,4.377777777777778
4196172,1,B003UD7JEE,"I was a big La Femme Nikita fan so looked forward to the opening of this series.  I was greatly disappointed.  To be fair, I only watched the first couple of shows so maybe it improved.  They should have given it a different name so that expectations would not have been so high.",1294358400,10,279,4.226415094339623
4196173,4,B003UD7JEE,"Of course, there is the French movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B00008ZZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>&nbsp;which is fantastic on it's own, and I remember the day I heard there was going to be an American remake, and did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised with the result in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-of-No-Return/dp/B001O7JHV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point of No Return</a>. The remake being reflective of the original, and very well cast with Bridget Fonda and the late Anne Bancroft.  Not many realize there was a Japanese version called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Cat/dp/B001452BZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Cat</a>&nbsp;which is great, and there is even a sequel. But good luck finding those movies.

Bringing this character to television as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B00008ZL4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>&nbsp;was intriguing, and I looked forward to it with anticipation.  But could not imagine how they could make a series from it, but they succeeded in many ways.  Lasting five seasons, but a hot and sexy first three seasons that started going downhill by crossing the line.  Nikita and Michael kissing is the kiss of doom.  Just like Mulder and Scully.  Once it happens, the show is over.  However Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis were steaming hot, and the action in the first three seasons was off the charts.  It did in fact continue past the five seasons in a way since the creators went from cable to prime time with a tiny show they made called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B0044E9JU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>.  24 is basically their La Femme Nikita with a bigger budget.

Now comes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikita/dp/B0042K4ZZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikita</a>, another confusing thought, and what a huge risk to follow all of the former outings.  But bravo to the writers here.  I expected to go through the entire routine again from botched robbery to a course in etiquette, but they really took this a step further.  I actually don't want to give away the plot (see the Pilot) because there is one helluva twist here.  Nikita is in fact her sexy self in another body, but we have a bonus in Alex (young woman).  However, Michael is not smoldering hot to the point of toe curling, nor intimidating in any way, as Shane West does not have what it takes. We do need to see less of him, and he should probably die.  Since this is in the future of the story, it would be okay to see him canceled.

For television, Roy and Peta will be hard to beat in the back scratching sexual tension, but it still works here.  There is no sexual chemistry between Michael and Nikita, because that was in the past, and they are not together with this plot. But they have history that you watch as if you are in on the secret. So, we are relying on Alex to bring the attraction and the action, and Nikita will have her back.  There is still plenty of action, innuendo, rivalry, survival, and mind games in a well written series staying true to the feeling of our heroine being who we know, just a bit in her future.  Maggie Q makes a great Nikita and is hot enough in all areas of her role.  I look forward to seeing where they go with this.  I just hope they know when to stop.",1293753600,5,3599,5.723684210526316
4196174,1,B003UD7JEE,"Completely dissatisfied with this new show. Shane West is awful. Maggie is passable, but not convincing as a kick ass spy, don't care if she does her own stunts she have a very fragile appearance. It does have nice effects, but I don't see chemistry and acting is really mediocre. Let's see it may pick up for the second season, but their ratings are very low anyway.",1293667200,7,367,4.492537313432836

8405872,4,B003UD7JEE,"An interesting series with Maggie Q as a rogue agent fighting against the assassination agency she has been trained for. She is very appealing, wears very sexy outfits and is believable--to a point. The sub plot involves another agent who infiltrates and becomes Maggie's pipeline to what the agency is doing. This gets overdone and makes for many betrayals and renewals. It gets a bit tiresome about halfway through the first season. But--and it's a big but--there is one episode that is entirely ludicrous that spoils the entire effect, at least for me. Maggie wears numerous revealing outfits, flirts and is not averse to having sex to get what she wants or just for her own pleasure. This is consistent with her character.
However, in one scene, she is in bed naked with the man she has just had sex with. She gets out of bed after she has just had sex with this man and they are lying there together. No one else is in the room and no one can see in. Maggie gets out of bed and drags the entire sheet with her so no one can see her naked body. There is only the man she has just had naked sex with. Why in the world would she want to hide her body from him? It is complete nonsense. Of course the producers didn't want to show enough to make the rating non-family friendly, but the scene could have been shot in a different way, letting her walk behind furniture or just shooting so her nakedness wouldn't have been completely revealed. It is just stupid the way they did it, and then all the revealing clothes and suggestions of sex are completely wasted. If she is such a prude she can't let a man she has sex with see her body, all the rest is just play acting. It ruined it for me because of the stupidity, not because I wanted to see her nude.",1497484800,2,1753,4.331306990881459
