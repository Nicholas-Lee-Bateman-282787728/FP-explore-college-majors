2136469,5,B0002XGDJC,"I used to watch this as a girl at my best friend's house all the time - to me, it's far more heartfelt and touching than what Disney did to Hans Christian Andersen's original tale, and I'm more than glad that there's an animated version of it.

I would suggest this to anyone to watch, honestly. Yes, it's not a 'happy' ending in the same way that Disney's is, and the mermaid goes through much more than ""Ariel"" does, but it's got so much more depth of emotion. The pain, love, wonder . . . it's all palpable in this movie, and in the original tale. A message of sacrifices and risks that don't pan out, and of self-sacrificing love. To me that's a far deeper love than leaving your familiar surroundings for another. Anyone could do that. But could you sacrifice your happiness for theirs?

Overall a beautiful story. Thank you, Denmark for the author of this!",1292025600,10,862,4.449367088607595
2136470,5,B0002XGDJC,"The first time I saw this movie was when I was a little girl.  It's a wonderful story and the music is heart-felt.  The song she sings shows so much emotion that you can just feel the love she has for the Prince.  One of the first animes made and I think they did a wonderful job, although, when I watch it now I anxiously wait for them to clean it up and make it into a DVD.  It's the right length and doesn't jump around like other 80's shows do.  The only grudge I have against it is that Marina dies in the end.  I never liked that part which is why I was so happy when Disney made a Little Mermaid that didn't die.

But if you want a classic Little Mermaid with a good story, good music, and is colorful, then this is the movie for you!",1280707200,,741,3.9
2136471,4,B0002XGDJC,i've looked all over for this movie because i used to watch it as a child and it got lost. it's so sad but there's beautiful music in it and i like to watch it every once in a while for sentimental reasons.,1262822400,,206,3.813953488372093
2136472,1,B0002XGDJC,"I remember seeing this movie when I was very little.  The Disney version was one of my favorite movies and I thought I would try this one as well.  This movie was deeply disturbing.  I liked the dolphin and that was about it.  I hated the fact that not only was there a scary ""ursula"" like person, but the prince married someone else and the mermaid DIES!!!  If memory serves me right, she stabs herself and floats to the bottom of the ocean.  I still remember this scene quit well and it still makes me sad.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially small children.",1240617600,,580,4.364485981308412
2136473,3,B0002XGDJC,"This review will contain spoilers:

Plot:
The story revolves around the 16 year old Marina who is about to get her first pearl from her grandmother to celebrate her coming of age. However she comes across a prince in which she saves and falls in love with, he on the other hand, doesn't remember her face. So Marina desperately tries to find a way to seek the Prince's love, eventually turning to the sea-witch for help. The sea-witch never ""interferes"" with the little mermaid's love-interest.

The humans do. At one point Marina is even thrown into ""jail"" due to false treason against her. This is not a Disney-Happy ending movie.
The ending can be viewed as both sad yet powerful at the same time, and as the title states it's ""the story of a beautiful mermaid who gave up a kingdom for the beloved prince"". Marina is left with a choice, should she do what it takes to save herself, or will she choose to keep her hands pure?

My only gripe is after how the prince ""fought"" to be with Marina quickly forgets her after meeting the woman who took care of him from the beach. This leads to a bitter and angry princess who felt betrayed in her first experience with love.

We are even given a brief peak of what Marina was thinking when she was holding that dagger of sorrow and anger over the Prince's heart. She wanted to kill him, but she couldn't. As much as she wanted to scar him as he did to her, she couldn't find herself to do it.

Unknowing as the prince slept soundly next to his bride, he left Marina to her unmerciful fate. It was too late when he awoke however, only to see her form plunge into the murky depths below did he then realize that she was the one.

This movie has been made in the 70's on VHS, because of the video-quality and shortness I have given it 3 stars. Beautiful video that needs updating, a classic to any fan of Hans Christian Anderson's work.

Has anyone else notice how the Prince looks like Cye? (Ronin Warriors) and the similarities of them focused around water?",1238889600,4,2002,4.394594594594595

2136475,5,B0002XGDJC,"I wouldn't go as far as to say this one is not children, but it is definitely not the jovial sing-along portrayal of this story in the way that Disney conveys it. This has been one of my favorites for as long as I can remember, and it still is. It can be very disturbing at moments, and will definately lead to you to think beyond the story and even more so beyond what you believe about love, life and death. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys films that are more than of surface value.",1164153600,5,503,4.142857142857143
2136476,5,B0002XGDJC,I've had this video since I was a little girl and I still enjoy watching it..and still cry to it every time I see it!  Definatley a classic!  I wish I could find the music that was in it!,1126224000,3,187,3.769230769230769

2136522,5,B0002XGDJC,"I have watched The Little Mermaid since I was a child. I remember rewinding my battered Betamax tape over and over again. Every time I watched it, I cried at the ending. It wasn't just a little sniff; I cried my eyes out! No one understood why an anime would make me cry and leave me feeling incredibly sad, because animated movies are supposed to be fun, or at least keep your tears at bay, right? Not this one. This one will move you to tears.

This is the classic, timeless tale of The Little Mermaid - before it was butchered by Disney. While I am a fan of Disney movies, I hated them for ruining a classic. I was forced to watch The Little Mermaid (Disney) with my friend. I recall fuming at the Disney-esque ending. Don't get me wrong, I love happily-ever-after endings, but the beauty of Hans Andersen's tale was that it was bittersweet and tragically beautiful. I can't picture it any other way. Until this day, I can't watch it without shedding tears. If Andersen were alive, he should sue Disney for ruining his fairy tale. Fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretel have a scary tone (the witch trying to eat them).These stories have been recited to us since we were kids, so I don't understand why Disney had to change the ending of THIS fairy tale.

The Little Mermaid is a heart-tugging, memorable story of love and sacrifice. When I watched it as an adult, I had a different appreciation for it. I saw the moral lesson behind the fairy tale. The melancholic music simply coheres with the tragic story. The little Mermaid ranks as one of my Top Three animated movies of all time. The other two are Swan Lake and The Last Unicorn. This is a must-see animated movie, and once you see it, you will know why the fans hate the Disney version.",1364688000,3,1746,4.419254658385094
2136523,5,B0002XGDJC,"Back in the olden days when VHS was new and Ariel The Little Mermaid hit theaters for the first time ""The Little Mermaid"" was on everyone's wish lists. My Dad not knowing which little mermaid was which picked this video up and brought it home for the family to watch instead of the Disney one. Maybe because it was on sale or cheaper who knows. To a Kid somethings are too adult to really understand and a lot of fairy tales have serious messages that you just don't understand when your younger. The Disney version is a goofy one for kids to watch and enjoy but this is the real story and it's serious business. I don't think I've ever felt so sad as a kid after watching this movie. I remember going back to school and all the kids talking about ""The little Mermaid"" the Disney one, and all I could think about was THIS movie and how sad it was. There's no happy go lucky ending her folks, this is real life. Some things stick with you as you grow up throughout life and this movie was one of them. I think I appreciated having watched this now as an adult than I did as a kid. This is a very beautiful story. I still have my original VHS and VCR to watch it on so for now I'm okay ""sniff sniff"".",1348704000,9,1198,4.1239316239316235
2136524,4,B0002XGDJC,"I was extremely happy to find this movie and to finally watch it again.  I hadn't seen it since I was 11 years old and I am now 42!  Wow!  I wanted my children to see it and all though they weren't too thrilled about the animation (they thought it was very cheezy), they still enjoyed the story line.  They laughed and thought it was so cool that the mermaids ""real"" name was Marina and not Ariel...because Mommy's name...yes ""MY"" name is...Marina!  LOL

This is a very sad movie which makes one think about the choices they make in life and how there are consequences for our actions.  Not everything turns out good and life isn't always Happily Ever After.  There is some nudity in this film, but it's very innocent.  The mermaids don't wear sea shells like Ariel so if that bothers you, don't purchase this for your small children.  In my opinion, this is a wonderful sweet movie to add to your collection.  Even if just to watch it yourself!  ;)",1322611200,11,949,4.421965317919075

I had my boyfriend cracking up after I told him I brought this movie to school in first grade and how I was indignant that my teacher said that this was NOT ""The Little Mermaid.""

I bought this VHS because I collect movies I enjoyed as I kid and it is now the only VHS I own as an adult. I plan on getting a VCR just to watch it. :)",1426204800,,554,3.893805309734513
