342268,4,6301618602,"This excellent six-hour miniseries should be seen by as many people as possible. Based on William L. Shirer's experience as a journalist in Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the Second World War, it is nearly flawless in its writing, acting, direction, etc. Alas, there is one unavoidable flaw. Hitler's personal filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl lived until 2003, dying peacefully in her sleep at the ripe old age of 101. Never having actually joined the Nazi party, she was (arguably) the most powerful cog in the Nazi propaganda machine. Still, she managed to avoid being convicted by the Allies after the war and became a wealthy woman. Riefenstahl was also notoriously litigious (and usually successful) whenever anyone dared to publicly accuse her of having been a Nazi. So, the producers of ""The Nightmare Years"" were forced to go to great lengths to point out that the (fictional) female filmmaker ""Helga Bauer"" who is depicted in this film is NOT Leni Riefenstahl. They even go so far as to say emphatically that Bauer is not Riefenstahl, even though scenes from Riefenstahl's films are shown as Bauer's films...It's truly a shame that Shirer's damning (and truthful) depiction of Riefenstahl's role in the Nazi rise to power could not be shown in this film...""The Nightmare Years"" is superb, despite this necessary change in the historical record. Hopefully, many people will watch this miniseries, and they will be inspired to do further research into this period, including finding out about Riefenstahl's culpability in promoting Hitler's and Goebbels' lies.",1289174400,8,1570,5.1607843137254905
342269,5,6301618602,"I loved this show.  It's about William Shirer's (Sam Waterson)life in pre war Berlin.  William Shirer wrote ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" and ""Berlin Diary"" (which is what this show is based). He's an outsider looking in plus a part of Berlin's life before Hitler.  It's quite fascinating.  I highly recommend this show.",1266105600,,329,4.821428571428571
342270,5,6301618602,"If this is the movie I think it is - and the cover of the VHS shown on the Amazon site - I don't
understand why the star - Sam Waterston - was not mentioned as the lead and the person who played
Shirer?  this is an excellent and classy production aand fascinating becaus true.",1261440000,,276,4.0181818181818185
342271,5,6301618602,"I have been a fan of Mr. William Shirer for many years and have read about his correspondence during the Nazi regime in Germany. This video compliments highly his views and the condition of the people very well during those years. Being a newspaperman he is critical and imaginative comparing Germany before and after the Nazi's.

7813680,4,6301618602,My husband and I watched this together. This is a must see because there are parallels of what is happening in our country. It is now available on DVD.,1479081600,2,151,4.241379310344827
7813681,5,6301618602,The movie series was just as the seller described. Such a wonderful story of William Shirer.  Fantastic!,1475452800,,104,5.117647058823529

7813684,5,6301618602,"This DVD has more of the movie on it than the VHS or US-DVD version does.  It appears to include the whole movie.  The movie itself is absolutely excellent.  I wish to state that I find it ridiculous that they sell Part I and not Part II anywhere.  In order to see this movie you have to order the NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2, Import one.  I'm glad we had to, though, because this one includes the whole movie.",1334880000,3,410,4.139240506329114
7813685,5,6301618602,"This is an excellent movie.  however, I wish to state how ridiculous I think it is that only part 1 is offered for sale and not part 2.  I searched for months all over the internet, especially Amazon, and Part II on VHS is not offered anywhere.  WHY?  Secondly, even on DVD it is not offered, only a foreign make is offered.  We finally got that one.  The movie is excellent.  Worth the wait.",1334880000,5,392,4.216216216216216
