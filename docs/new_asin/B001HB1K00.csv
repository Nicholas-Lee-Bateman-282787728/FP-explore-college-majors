3627900,4,B001HB1K00,"This movie was just about what I was thinking it would be.  It was funny throughout but not just hilarious.

There is a good bit of profanity along with f-bombs that are presented as ""f(sound of a ping-pong ball hiting a hard surface)k"". So I don't know if it is for younger kids.  Many of the profanities are hidden but not completely.

The story is good and kept me interested.  There is a lot of humor though I don't think it is most people's type of humor and I felt like there were some aspects I didn't think were funny but felt like it was intended to be funny.

I will probably watch it again sometime.  There's a lot of ping-pong in the movie.",1267401600,2,652,4.209677419354839

3627904,5,B001HB1K00,"I actually just saw this film at UC Davis' Asian American Association Film Festival tonight and had to immediately order the dvd online. It's that good! This movie is unbelievably hilarious and I found it really refreshing to watch a film that brings Asian stereotypes to light while making it funny. While a lot of the jokes are specific to Asian-Americans, I think anyone can appreciate the humor overall. Jimmy Tsai also did a Q&A after tonight's showing of this movie and was just awesome to talk to. So basically, it's a really great movie! Loved it!!!",1241827200,4,557,4.752577319587629

I was too shy to go down the aisle and meet Jimmy Tsai after the movie. It was way cool that they did a Q & A session after the movie for the audience members which is viewable on [...], just type in ""ping pong playa"".

As soon as the dvd came out I bought it and shared it with family and friends. Now those friends are going to buy a copy of their own. I purchased some of Jimmy's clothing from his company at venomsportswear.com they look way awesome! Way to go Jimmy!",1233532800,3,615,4.301724137931035

No mean spirited nonsense just alot of funny and fun ping pong and basketball as well as family stuff that wasn't the usual cliched crap. Loved the pseudo gangsta interactions. Overall....even though having it's share of cliches, a really nice change from the usual kids/sports comedies... ignore Mr. table tennis champ or whatever...he's just pissed because every single ping pong detail wasn't accurate or somethin... Yeah, enjoyed this movie alot!",1232496000,2,592,5.242105263157895
3627908,5,B001HB1K00,This movie was very entertaining.  Any Asian American (or friend of Asian American) can appreciate the humor in this movie.,1231200000,,123,5.15
3627909,5,B001HB1K00,"First saw this at the Eugene DisOrient Asian Film Festival over a year ago.  Funniest movie I've seen in ages.  Minimal spoilers below...

This is the story of a younger son in a Chinese-American family who is struggling with his identity and his cultural responsibility.  His elder brother is a ping pong champion, and the entire family's finances are contingent on the reputation of the family and their performance at a local ping pong tournament.  You can figure out the rest from there.

But this charming, hilarious, incredibly well-thought out movie by relative movie unknowns has more class, humor, and intelligence than most mainstream Hollywood comedies I've seen.  The vast majority of the humor is applicable to all races, all cultures, all walks of life... there are a few jokes and intimations specific to the Asian-American community... but I loved this movie so much I pre-ordered the DVD, feeling grateful that it actually made it out of it's film festival beginnings (into limited more mainstream release, but not where I live), onto DVD.

It's based on the classic athletic competition motif.  The oppressive, aggressive professional athlete coming to take over small local town ping pong hero.  Family obligation.  Cultural expectations.  Identity/social self-exploration/finding.  Touching characters with some depth.

The humor is classy, clever, witty.  It is not very subtle, just outright fun.  Language is pretty clean for a comedy, but still has quite a bit of profanity (teenage locker room talk) that is partially obscured by the sound of a bouncing ball or ping pong paddle hit or similar as a sort of tongue-in-cheek (ha, that's a pun!) censor.  Depending on your sensitivity to this sort of thing, appropriate for teens (13-14+), but prepare to cover the ears of your child if younger.  Subject material is otherwise pretty clean, and appropriate for even younger than teenaged kids.

It's a great film, IMO.

3627927,5,B001HB1K00,"Ping Pong Playa is among the best comedy sports movies.  Jimmy Tsai as the immature C-Dub is definitely the best performance in the movie, closely followed by Peter Paige and Scott Lowell as C-Dub's obnoxious British rival and his bumbling assistant.  The child acting isn't perfect, but Andrew Vo as Felix had some of the best moments of the movie.  The plot was simple but the suspense at the climactic scene at the end of the movie made up for that.  The score is fantastic.
The DVD has some nice special features, including a commentary that not only gives you a lot of details about production but also some of the hidden jokes throughout the movie.
Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend getting this DVD.",1374105600,,708,4.7317073170731705

Lazy at home, unable to hold a job, and with no real goals in life, C-Dub's life changes when a car accident sidelines both his ping pong champion brother, and his mother - who teaches kids ping pong at a local youth center. When C-Dub is forced to take over her ping pong lessons, he bucks every form of responsibility at first ... but eventually gets into working with the kids he teaches, and even starts wondering if he could possibly even defend his brother's titles in the upcoming ping pong championship games. Funny, charming, and with an undeniably lovable lead character in C-Dub (thanks to Jimmy Tsai), this is a sweet, funny ""Little Engine That Could"" story that will charm and satisfy.",1356998400,,948,4.8580246913580245

3627954,4,B001HB1K00,"What a pleasant surprise!  Had never heard of this but watched it on a lark and it was really fun.  The cast is very likeable, the humor is good-natured, and the overall tone is just goofy and fun.  In many ways this reminded me of 80s comedies like Better Off Dead or some of John Hughes stuff like 16 Candles, back when comedies didn't rely on extreme gross-out gags and in-your-face obscenity to generate laughs.  In fact, whenever an off-color word or phrase is used in Ping Pong Playa it is effectively bleeped out by the sound of a bouncing ball - a very random running gag that nevertheless made me laugh out loud more than once.  In this story about an underachieving wanna-be baller who finally has a shot at redeeming himself in the eyes of his family & his community via a local ping pong competition, you get a nice mix of satire (sports movies get their send-up through the dramatic come-from-behind ping pong tournament climax), cultural humor, very mild family dysfunction, and very mild teen angst as the bases for what ends up being a winning comedy.  If you're in the mood for a sweet comedy that forgoes the usual cheap-laughs raunch and succeeds instead with charm and wit, give this one a shot.",1333670400,,1215,4.576036866359447

I was surprised to learn Tsai isn't really an actor.  He was really good at this.  I hope he does more stuff.  The writing was awesome, and I loved how Chinese language was interwoven throughout.  And the kid actors in this movie were great!  Usually child actors are not. good. at. all.  But they were good!

I also enjoyed the whole eating cereal ""I love cereal"" song/bit.

This movie is not racist, it just points out racial differences and stereotyping. I don't like rap, but I think the rap songs were perfect. Especially ""I Like Cereal"". The rap song about ""Rims"" is so hilarious and fitting for the scene it is played during. The rap music sets the whole persona of this main character who is a gansta wannabe, but who can't ignore his roots even if he tries. If you are unfamiliar with Asian cultures or racial stereotyping, the humor in this movie might go right over your head. The racial comments/situations in this movie are there for humor, not to be menacing. But if you get all the jokes and the excellent, fine humor subtleties, your side will be splitting from laughter!

So tired of seeing the same unimaginative, lazy, fallback theme of making white people (any and all white people) the villain. Especially the way this movie does it casually like its okay. This is a dangerous movie that perpetuates racism against a group of people because they are not the color of another group of people. We work too hard for our money and work very hard being fair to all people to be abused because of the color of our skin by a movie that disguised itself as entertainment.",1317600000,5,646,4.551724137931035

The story itself is about Chris, an Asian American guy that wants to be a pro basketball player. He is not your stereotypical Asian guy. He isn't very smart, shy, or soft spoken. He says that in the movie too. lol He tells you what he wants! He wants to be a BALLER! Even though it didn't happen that way, he found out that he has natural talent in ping pong and starts competing in it. This all is very entertaining and has plenty of jokes with it. He then falls for the main cast gal and pursuit to win her over. The interaction with each other is very funny and witty ever time.

3627968,4,B001HB1K00,"""Ping Pong Playa"" is a hilarious comedy about a Chinese-American 20-something slacker named Chris ""C-Dub"" Wong who dreams of being a pro basketball player.  After losing his minimum wage job at the mall and causing a car accident in which both his mother and older (and very successful) brother are injured, his parents guilt him into teaching a ping pong class at the Chinese community center.  In between winning money from his much younger students at ping pong and losing money to adults at basketball, Wong begins training to take his brother's place at the local ping pong tournament.

This movie is entertaining for all audiences, but many of the jokes may be lost on those not familiar with Chinese culture and the Mandarin Chinese language.  The movie is in English, but Mandarin is spoken occasionally both by Wong's family and his best friend, an African-American who studies Chinese at the community center.",1268611200,2,919,4.9869281045751634

- Fun, moved along
- Pretty clean fun

What I didn't like:
- Another victim of Asian identity crisis.  The star ping pong player wants to be black.  Sigh .... it so sad to see one culture ripping off another culture which I think demeans both cultures.
- How Christopher (main character) turns into this crazy good ping pong player doesn't ring true
