2730619,5,B000MGBLVE,"The initial sequence in Mongolia is worth the purchase price. The scenery is amazing. The vibe of the movie reminded me of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy."" Wonderful movie.",1256860800,,165,4.724137931034483
2730620,5,B000MGBLVE,"The Great Match, 2006 is a Film Movement release.  Film Movement allows fans across the country to see films that may never have been released for international viewing.  It is a movement that features some of many years' best foreign and independent films, to bring them into your home.

Great Match is an international film that features three languages from different parts of the world, as three groups venture to view the 2002 World Cup Soccer Match between Brazil and Germany.  The three global groups are, a family of Mongolian nomads, a camel caravan of Tuareg in the Sahara, and a group of Indios in the Amazon.  So we get to follow the humorous journey these people embark on, just to see the game on TV, any TV.  It is enjoyable to the end, watching these people determined to see the game and their inventive ways for technology.

You may want to watch this a couple of times in order to fully grasp some humor missed the first time around.  Reading subtitles and trying to catch all the action can be daunting and challenging.

The film is very original, nothing of a storyline as this has been viewed.  That's what makes a film original and to find humor of this quality.

Once noticeable thing is the magnificent views of the world.  This is striking.

2730621,5,B000MGBLVE,Brilliant film-making.  The World Cup from the perspective of 3 entirely different peoples from three continents.  5 stars!,1223251200,,123,5.777777777777778
2730622,5,B000MGBLVE,"The ""Great Match"" is not only a spectacularly photographed film, but it offers fascinating glimpses of otherwise invisible cultures(unless you're a Discovery Channel addict!)in a charmingly offbeat and engaging way.

The scenes from the Mongolian steppes are my favorite, but overall the film serves to demonstrate once again that regardless of culture, physical location or language, guys around the world are all ""wired"" the same! If you ever questioned the veracity of pseudo-national events like the ""Superbowl"" & the ""World Series"", this makes clear that the World Cup Final is a truly planetary sports competition.

2730623,5,B000MGBLVE,"This is a happy, fun film, to enjoy and take for the ride.  The music and photography are wonderful.  I have shared this with a number of friends, and enjoy watching them, delight in the movie and anticipate their laughter.  We are the same the world over when it comes to soccer and comaraderie.",1180310400,3,296,4.444444444444445
2730624,5,B000MGBLVE,"Several startling sequences make this film one you'll dream about for a time.  Each of the three groups -Mongolian nomads, Brazilian natives, and Niger tribesmen- endeavor to view a World Cup soccer game on television.  The stories expand, then, on the circumstances on which they view the grainy images and the comradery that develops between otherwise coldly-considered neighbors.  The color palettes represented in these three stories are incredible.",1173484800,8,453,5.632352941176471

2730636,5,B000MGBLVE,"Wonderful movie about the passion of football (soccer) fans in far-flung parts of the world. If you love soccer, you should watch it.",1462579200,,133,4.826086956521739
2730637,4,B000MGBLVE,A very entertaining movie showing the contrast between different ways of life in a nice light heated way.,1459296000,,105,4.888888888888889

2730641,2,B000MGBLVE,"Definitely has some humorous parts and visually, it is a treat, particularly the scenes in Mongolia.  One thing I would like to draw attention to, though:  I would caution families who might consider it good viewing for all ages--it isn't.  A girlie magazine and selling of lewd photos by a young man as a quick way to make a buck is not funny nor appropriate.  Not only does he sell photos but the men dialogue about their preferences in body parts.  Base behavior which does not qualify for entertainment.  Would a situation like this have occurred if this was ""real life?""  Possibly.  But it was in bad taste to use this example as it's exploitative to women and shameful, generally speaking, regardless in which culture they're found.  Also some dialogue was crude or in otherwise bad taste.  It's adult, rather than family-friendly fare.  So glad I watched it before deciding to give it as a gift, sight unseen, to a soccer loving family with kids.",1411344000,2,953,4.715151515151515

2730643,4,B000MGBLVE,"Fun, funny and well put together. The image of the Brazilian indigenous peoples although somewhat negative might reflect some of the damage the contact with white tricksters caused to them - which is a shame. The film is entertaining and great for all ages.",1397952000,,257,4.863636363636363

2730645,5,B000MGBLVE,"There is so much to recommend this movie, that it's hard to know where to begin. The universality of many human attributes, e.g. need for entertainment, human ingenuity, etc is presented with terrific insight and humor. Our family loves this movie so much that we bought it and make it a family evening to watch it at least once a year.",1390608000,,336,4.524590163934426
2730646,4,B000MGBLVE,Interesting plot:  3 different cultures from around the world are avidly interested in seeing the World Cup game and the lengths that they go to to do so.  Enjoyable but not overly excited.,1373500800,,189,4.696969696969697

2730648,5,B000MGBLVE,What a gem of a movie this is. The cinematography is stunning at times and the story warm and human and filled with gentle humor. Don't let the thought of captions deter you. This movie entertains from its opening moments to the very end.,1369353600,,238,4.431818181818182
2730649,5,B000MGBLVE,"This comedy under a documentary format, transports the viewer to fantastic world sites that do not have any kind of communication with western world.  Great photography. Each story is related by the same passion Football (soccer). Great film, it worth it!",1362787200,,255,5.219512195121951
2730650,5,B000MGBLVE,"As a football fan (World football, US soccer), I loved this movie.  Great way to show the pasion for the event, especially when it comes to a World Cup Final match.  It is an awesome cultural portrait of three social groups that live far away from the sports glamour, but that enjoy it and certainly don't want to miss a slice of history that comes every four years. You will learn something else besides football watching this nice comedy.
The movie itself is not an original idea, The Cup (1999), shows exactly the same motivation in a group of Tibetan monks to watch France 1998 Final Match.  Both are worth every second watching.",1324857600,,633,4.584070796460177
2730651,5,B000MGBLVE,"Five stars aren't enough to describe the fun we had watching this film.  How they made it, I'll never know, with three wild and disparate locations: Mongolia, the Sahara, and the Amazon jungle.  In it, people who live in yurts and hunt with Golden Eagles; people who travel desert dunes in camel trains; and people who use blowguns and eat monkeys, all do their utmost to view a World Cup soccer match.  Don't care about soccer?  Never mind.  You won't see much of it.  (Nor will they.)  Just get this movie, enjoy the charmingly real people, the wonderfully scripted action, and the amazing scenery, and laugh until it hurts.  The Great Match definitely took our minds off the ""Where is Noah when you need him?"" winter downpour at our Hawaiian rainforest home.

This would be great to show your guests just before the ""Big Game"" comes on TV.",1299196800,,295,4.584905660377358
2730653,5,B000MGBLVE,"This beautiful film has some unforgettable shots of remote landscapes that you otherwise would hardly come across. It's a feel-good story of three men from these remote communities who've set themselves a goal to get to watch the final match of the World Cup. They use their witty inventiveness to access the so-desired point where they can fully enjoy the spectacular game of football.

The characters are great and the film is great fun to watch - and a pure visual feast!",1292976000,,474,4.780487804878049
2730654,5,B000MGBLVE,"Thank god my husband Netflixed ""The Great Match"". It was a pure joy to watch the three communities scramble to watch the World Cup. And as my husband continually reminded me, the next WC is right around the corner. What made the film fantastic was the dialogue. The cultural nuances and references woven seamlessly throughout the movie kept the film incredibly fast paced. By the end, it seemed as if the viewer (me) had known the individuals and their quirks for years. The best part is that you wanted to know these characters, they were hysterical.",1267056000,3,551,4.75

8168536,5,B000MGBLVE,"As a world traveling soccer fan who learned the sport in Argentina and once worked for a FIFA World Cup, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It is ""uneven"" as it follows the desperate efforts of aficionados from Mongolia, Niger and the Brazilian Amazon to find an available television set for viewing the final game of a World Cup.  But the characters are authentic and charming as they dramatize to non-soccer people just how important the ""beautiful game"" is to the bulk of the planet's sports viewers.  The images will stay with you long after viewing.  There's more to the Great Match than just soccer.",1482796800,,604,4.778846153846154
