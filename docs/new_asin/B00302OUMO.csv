The rest of this show is hearsay, false accusations, and, quite frankly, garbage!  And this show was produced by a channel that calls themselves History?  What a joke!  I guess I should have known better  these are the same people that created Ancient Aliens.",1427846400,,420,4.928571428571429

Specifically, a large cache of human bones were found in the basement of a building in England where Benjamin Franklin lived for several  years.  This 'documentary' puts forth an explanation worthy of the National Enquirer.  You'd be far more informed if you watched 'Ben Franklin's Bones' on PBS http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/ben-franklins-bones-full-episode/2074/.",1426636800,,470,6.296875
8385466,5,B00302OUMO,"Everything which was me in the United States of America was made from hemp which was grown in this country from 1620-1970.  From this country everyone grew hemp until commercial tobacco production began, then crop rotations were grown legally with hemp until 1970.

Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  When Franklin went as the Ambassador to France:

a.  his clothing was 'homespun' and completely made with hemp,
b.  the sails on the ship he went to France were completely made with 380,000 pounds of hemp,
c.  the paper made with the Declaration of Independents was completely made with hemp,
d.  the paper made with the Constitution of the United States of America was completely made with hemp,
e.  the paper in books, including every Bible made in this country, and most of the books which started the Library of Congress were made with hemp,
f.  the newspapers were all made with hemp,
g.  even the flag made by Betsy Ross was made with hemp.

Going forward, between around 1900-1943 farmers grew hemp with acres and acres on their farms.  Even during the Second World War, American farmers were encouraged to apply for a license from the United States government to grow hemp; they grew 375,000 acres in 1943 ... The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 went into law in Congress on October 1, 1937, as Public Law 238 and stayed in-force for more than 33 years.  Afterwards, crop rotations were grown legally with hemp until 1970.

Hemp can be used to produce biomass fuels, paper, fabrics, body care products, detergents, food products, biodegradable industrial products, even art supplies.  These products were made during World War II and they should be done now.

Hemp grows well without herbicides, fungicides, or pesticides.  Hemp is an environmental, renewable, reusable a recyclable resource.

As well,

a.  Henry Ford's first Model-T was built to run on hemp 'gasoline,'
b.  Hemp fuel is biodegradable--so oil spills becomes fertilizer not eco-catastrophes,
c.  Hemp fuel does not contribute to air poisoning with sulfur dioxide,
d.  Hemp has no emissions lie carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and
e.  Hemp fuel is non-toxic and only a mild skin irritant.

Biomass fuels are 'in-the-middle':  between oil and gas to ethanol and bio-diesel to algae, and hemp is one of them--better than corn or sugar.

I believe that petro-chemical oil 'companies' need to be converted to biomass pyrolysis with hemp to algae within the United States of America for lower carbon dioxide to nearly zero and reverse global warming.",1355270400,2,2566,5.002364066193853

8385468,1,B00302OUMO,"If I could rate zero stars or negative stars, I would have. Never mind the constant negative associations of the Founders with Free Masonry, the unmitigated anti-American bias of the producers of ""Secrets"" is on full display. ""Secrets"" is a particularly pathetic example of a ""documentary"".  The attacks on history are notable, including the shows subject matter ""authorities"" going so far as to blatantly state that the Founders were actually ""terrorists"", drunks and drug addicts, stating ""they were stoned or drunk or both when writing the Declaration of Independence"".  This waste-of-time is short on any useful information but long on it's unrelenting attempt to disparage and invalidate our Founding Fathers as some of the greatest men and minds to ever work together to form the Greatest Nation on this earth. Anybody with a modicum of love for this country or even a meager grasp of history will be wholly offended and utterly revolted by this tripe.  Watch if you must, but only to see the depth of hatred for America some people have.  Absolute garbage.",1331251200,4,1063,5.057142857142857
8385469,2,B00302OUMO,"Like it or not, a high percentage of the founding fathers were members of the Masons and many of the Masonic ideas and concepts are apparent when he examine the founding of the country. Here's a few examples from the documentary -

* George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Monroe, Paul Revere, John Paul Jones, and Alexander Hamilton were all active Masons
* 13 of the 39 signers of the Constitution were Masons
* 9 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence were Masons
* 33 Generals under Washington were Masons

The number 13, important to the Masons, appears in many places on the Great Seal. For example:

* 13 stars in the crest
* 13 stripes in the shield
* 13 olive leaves clutched in the Eagle's left claw
* 13 arrows clutched in the Eagle's right claw
* 13 letters in the words - ""E Pluribus Unum""
* 13 letters in the words - ""Annuit Coeptis""
* 13 levels of stone in the Pyramid

There's more, but you can see the documentary.

Thus, examining the influence of the Masons on the founding of the country is a legitimate course of inquiry. And while this documentary does present a good deal of information about this topic, the mid part of this 2 hour show tends to stray into the area of sex and drugs, which quite frankly seems more exploitive than  anything else.

Moreover, the case for ""influence"" vs. ""conspiracy"" is never well made, and many people may tend to dismiss the content because of this.

Bottom line - this is a deeply flawed documentary, yet it has much useful information inside.",1310860800,4,1540,4.554347826086956
8385470,3,B00302OUMO,"Found some interesting throughts but was disturbed by over-dramatized production and lack of understanding of the Mason moveent AT THAT TIME.  ALSO, some very disturbing mistakes!  The History Channel usually does much better!  But, from now on, will always question their productions.

8385471,1,B00302OUMO,"I saw this on the History Channel last summer (2009). What a joke. The title suggests that this would be a show where we might learn a little about the private lives of the Founding Fathers and some of their imperfections. But this was nothing but a show for Masonic conspiracy theorists to present their lunatic beliefs. Little time was given for any ""naysayers."" The narrator sounded like a firm believer in these crazy ideas rather than a neutral observer.

Here's the web site of Ralph Epperson, one of the main conspiracy theorists in this show: [...] He's been ranting this nonsense for decades. He makes it sound like the U.S. Constitution is part of a ""Satanic, Masonic"" plot of world domination.

As if the conspiracy theories weren't bad enough, the show said that Solomon's Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D. Had they done a little simple research, they would have found that Solomon's Temple was destroyed in 586 B.C.E. (Before Christian Era) by the Babylonians. It was the Temple built by King Herod that was destroyed in 70 A.D. by the Romans.

Three tenets of any conspiracy theory are: (1) nothing is what it appears to be; (2) nothing happens by accident; and (3) everything's connected. Also, if you question the theory, theorists will probably say you're part of it.

The History Channel has usually had a pretty good record of presenting both sides of an issue. But in some shows like the ones on UFOs, Nostradamus and these predictions of ""armageddon,"" and this one, there is no balance. Nonbelievers are given hardly any time. I hope there isn't too much more of this sensationalist trash.

In advertising the show last year, the least the History Channel could have done was provide a detailed description. None of the advertisements said that this was about conspiracy theories. Here on Amazon, there is a reasonable description, but it doesn't mention that the show only from the conspiracy theorist point of view.",1266796800,6,1936,4.8545454545454545
