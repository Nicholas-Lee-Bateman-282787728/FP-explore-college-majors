And the picture on the DVD cover is not the costume, makeup or even age of Franco Corelli shown in this version of Turandot. I did enjoy the music, but a CD would have been just as good.",1120694400,22,282,4.053571428571429

8039828,5,B000679NFA,"Turandot is the first opera I ever saw performed and the story of this exciting land its ghosts and its beautiful, cursed princess is something I never tire of visiting. It is my favorite opera, and my passion for this world has lead me to meet many Calafs. I have seen the broadcasts of Martinucci, Carreras, Domingo, Glouzine, Cecchelle, Bonisolli and many more, and Corelli is easily the greatest Calaf the screen has ever captured. It is hard to choose which of Corelli's own interpretations of his signature role is greatest, he continuously outdid his own work as a singer and I am partial to the bootleg audios of the very poetic, gorgeous and mature shades from his Monte Carlo Turandot. But here younger Corelli is still eager to please with brilliant, squillo-filled voice. However this version is very special as it is a rare chance to see him physically inhabit the role, and understand why one of the finest filmmakers in the history of art, Luchino Visconti, became so enamored with directing him, instructing and watching him. In addition to Corelli's almost supernatural stage presence, which is evident from the legacy of photographs he left behind, he crafts a Calaf of remarkable intelligence, and his expressions set the standard for subtly to in this role. He is a more introspective and wistful Calaf than say Domingo's very physical, frank and warm as the sunshine performance, as much a prisoner of his own history as Turandot is of hers. And he is fascinating to watch, making this as much of a visual experience as it is food for the ears. He carries himself with an aristocracy that is not usually associated with the verisimo roles he set the bar in performances of. Never have I seen any other Calaf imagine a more convincing bearing for the unknown prince. His eyes are communicative as they always were, and his ancient, almost Grecian face is also irreplaceable.

This is also a haunting Turandot from a cinematic angle, and after much consideration it is also I think the best directed Turandot production. While some have felt that the visual style was harsh and difficult to see, this is a story with a horror element as well as a story of romance and epic scope, the back story is an invasion, a rape and a murder. It is a story of curses, executions, suicides with invocations to the Gods and a land of the dead that cannot be kept out of our living one, the use of low lighting is beneficial to bringing out some of the emotional qualities latent in the story. It has a tone of mystery, loss and quality of Princess Turandot herself that makes it as interesting in its own way as the spectacle-focused versions of recent years like the Zefferelli classic or the Forbidden City project. The physically dark qualities were moreover absolutely essential to overcoming the limited budget of 1950s television. Masters of ambiance and enigma like Jacques Tourneur, Alfred Hitchcock or Val Lewton would have never filmed a project made under these circumstances flamboyantly. Atmosphere must be employed to suggest the nature of the world where money cannot, and within the budget the director uses imagination, very photogenic, sensitive shots of the singers , gives them correct stage directions and films some stunningly-painted masks. The very beginning of the film of the costumed dancer is hypnotic and lets the viewers know right away that they are in for a uniquely beautiful production of Turandot.",1393632000,,3438,4.8568994889267465
8039829,3,B000679NFA,"The one thing this DVD has to recommend it is Corelli !  The rest of the cast is quite good as well .

HOWEVER:  The video quality is poor ( not just because it is black and white) .  The sound quality is spotty.

There are a number of more recent Turandot videos  that are more satisfying (at least to me).

 The value of this DVD is as a video record of the finest Calaf ( in my opinion) of the last 50 years.

 The Nilsson - Corelli EMI audio-only recording of this opera  may be a better approach",1388534400,,500,3.9494949494949494
8039830,5,B000679NFA,"First, ignore some of the rather uninformed comments about the quality of this black-and white film, which is actually perfectly fine.  The production was conceived as a melding of kabuki theater with Italian commedia dell' arte traditions, and the resulting highly stylized combination suits the story to a T.

Second, the singing is uniformly strong.  Franco Corelli was THE Calaf of the ages, and this is the finest of his several commercial and live recordings.  The nervous self-consciousness that sometimes marred his studio efforts is completely absent, and he sings with golden burnished tones that are simply stunning.  Lucille Udovich, an American who made her career mostly in Europe, is a superior Turandot.  Her one commercial recording on LP was the 1956 EMI Idomeneo led by John Pritchard, in which she turns in a fine Elettra.  Here, she is a little too cool and correct in ""In questa reggia"", but becomes fully involved beginning with the riddle scene, and handles her entire part without evident strain.  Her minor drawbacks are that her decidedly Slavic facial features (she was of Ukrainian descent) and obviously 40-ish age make for a rather homely-looking princess, and her voice also is more Slavic than Italianate in sound.  Renata Mattioli is a fine Liu, though her aria ""Signore, ascolta"" is taken at too fast a clip and with none of the needed rubato.  (Contrary to one claim made here, nothing is missing from it due to a bad film splice.)  Plinio Clabassi is a first-rate Timur; Mario Borriello, Mario Carlin, and Renato Ercolani make for a fine Ping/Pang/Pong trio; Nino del Sole is a solid Emperor; and Teodoro Rovetta is a suitably menacing mandarin.  (The one-word role of the Prince of Persia is not credited, to my recollection.)  The chorus is fine, and except for in the Act I aria of Liu previously noted, Fernando Previtali turns in a superior account of the score, keeping it lean and brisk but not slighting on the orchestral color.

This is one of three excellent versions of Turandot on DVD.  The other two are the Metropolitan Opera's opulent Franco Zeffirelli production with Eva Marton, Leona Mitchell, Placido Domingo, and Paul Plishka under James Levine, and the outdoor Arena di Verona production by Brian Large with Ghena Dimitrova, Cecilia Gasdia, Nicola Martinucci, and Ivo Vinco under Daniel Oren. Overall I prefer the singers in the Verona production.  Dimitrova is the Turandot for the ages, with a voice as titanic as her physique is zaftig, whereas Marton is already showing signs of the vocal wear and tear that presaged her imminent vocal decline. Likewise, Nicola Martinucci brings his decidedly baritonal voice effectively (if unsubtly) to bear as Calaf, whereas Domingo is not in his best form and shows moments of strain. Gasdia and Vinco are likewise superior to Mitchell and Plishka (and Gasdia to Mattioli as well).  However, the recorded sound in the outdoor venue is somewhat diffuse, and the conducting a bit slack compared to either Previtali or Levine, and of course the Zeffirelli staging is in a class by itself.  (Ignore the asinine carping of snotty New York critics, who scorn anything traditional and also despise Zeffirelli for irrelevant political reasons.)  It also has the bonus of the great Hugues Cuenod as the Emperor.  Personally, I couldn't live without all three versions in my collection, so don't ask me to say that one is better than another -- just get them all and revel in them!",1366416000,10,3471,4.982668977469671
8039831,5,B000679NFA,"Puccini was composing Turandot around the time Caruso died and Corelli was born....the role fit Franco like a glove.  He never sang it quite the same way twice, so by all means get this video if you've never seen it.  Yes, you must have a tolerance for black & white as well as the custom of the time of recording first and then acting to the playback (in one take!), but this is a fantastic souvenir of Franco in his vocal prime, although I agree with another poster that the video portion at times is unfortunately dark. I still was able to enjoy it, however, & especially certain favorite sections. No one ever mastered the Act 2 transition from the triumphant unwritten high C on ""ardante"" through the ""you don't know my name...tell me my name, etc."" as he poses his own challenge to the princess. Never a throwaway with Franco as it is with many tenors, but rather a pivitol point in the opera. End of Track 15 & beginning of 16.  This video allows you to watch & listen for it.
  At the time this was filmed for Italian TV,  Turandot was being performed in Milan by Nilsson & DiStefano at LaScala.  DiStefano cancelled one night, and Franco was brought in from this filming to sing his first Calaf on the stage of the Scala.  He literally met Birgit Nilsson for the first time that night on stage, and the rest is history.  Only three years later, Corelli & Nilsson popularized this opera at the Metropolitan Opera in the acclaimed Cecil Beaton new production of 1961, and it famously took off from there....Anyway, I highly recommend this video if you can handle black & white, a little on the dark side.  Some trivia, the stylized actions of the chorus are a nod to commedia del'arte, and the soprano Udovick was born in Denver, Colorado.  This DVD also has a bonus:  scenes from Tosca which originally appeared on the Bell Telephone Hour tv show in 1962, and they are in color.",1284163200,10,1886,4.482456140350878
8039832,4,B000679NFA,"Corelli's performance in Turandot is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Unbelivable vocal quality combines with superb acting makes this DVD a must for every collector.  Despite being slightly dark, the video incompasses the best of what Turandot can be.  A professional, steller production at every level with th ""cast"" delivering an excellent counterpoint to Corelli's legendary performance.",1205625600,14,391,5.824561403508772
8039833,3,B000679NFA,"Please keep in mind that back in the 1950s, most television broadcasts were live to black-and-white TVs only.  A common method to get live TV to 16 or 35 millimeter optical film was to point a camera toward a TV screen and film the over-the-air broadcast.  Frame rates of television and motion picture cameras do not match. A kinescope would be needed to better match the frame rates.  This video, however, looks like an amateur videographer somehow recorded the live TV broadcast to tape, but had only one-hour-length tapes on hand, so we lose part of Liu's aria during the tape swap. Keep in mind also that European PAL and American NTSC video formats differ. So, it is indeed unfortunate that a better source of this television production doesn't exist on the market, but I'm happy to have the videotape anyway. In my opinion, Franco Corelli is the definitive Calaf.",1202342400,5,869,4.78
8039834,4,B000679NFA,"In spite of the black and white, flickering 1958 picture, this was an excellent production of Turandot.  It would have been magnificent in color!  I bought this to see Franco Corelli for the first time and was not disappointed.  (He reminds me of Jose Carreras.)

But it was Lucille Udovich as Princess Turandot who impressed me greatly as the probable role model for Eva Marton.  She had to have seen this production at some time.  Eva Marton is my favorite in this role and watching Udovich, who even looks like Eva Marton, all I could think was, ""She's as good as Eva Marton!""  But Udovich came first, of course.

Renata Mattioli was heavenly as Liu and the singers who portrayed Ping, Pang, and Pong were great, too.

It's worth a watching!",1200960000,4,744,4.6183206106870225
8039835,4,B000679NFA,"If you are prepared to watch a 1958's black and white movie, without today's high technology, this DVD is worth to watch. Especially, as a loyal Corelli's fan, after having listened to his CD of Turandot for many times, it was a reward to actually see Corelli in this performance. Corelli's voice was fabulous, overall the sound was great and what a handsome, romantic hero he was!",1192233600,16,381,4.701492537313433
8039836,4,B000679NFA,"I had the privilege of seeing Franco Corelli as Calaf during his last years at the Met, and believe me, he spoils you for all other Calafs. Yes, the cover photo shows him in a different costume than this production, but what of that? This is an old B&W production, made for Italian television, with old technology, so don't expect the expanse and color of the Met or the visual clarity and camerawork of a good modern production. But it is wonderful to hear and interesting to watch (what ""Turandot"" isn't at least somewhat imaginative?), but above all, it is carried by the magnificent voice and carriage of the tenor that could sell ""Nessun Dorma"" like no other. He looks the part; he acts the part; and his ringing high notes can make you weak in the knees. I don't mean to give the sopranos short shrift, either - they are both excellent. At any rate, if you love this opera, give it a try.",1185494400,33,894,4.424242424242424
