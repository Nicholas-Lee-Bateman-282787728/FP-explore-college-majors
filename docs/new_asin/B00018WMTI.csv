8007970,3,B00018WMTI,"Is it at all possible that in the end THE FINAL FRONTIER is simply mediocrity? Judging by the 10 clunkers in this DVD set, it just may be. Among the slim pickings here are two spaghetti sci-fi stinkers (""Space Men"" and ""The Day the Sky Exploded""), an early Japanese import that's running on 3-cylinders (""Warning From Space"") and a no-budget example from the Golden Age of Sillyvision (""Rocky Jones"").

What's leftover are mostly-forgotten drive-in movie stuff. This collection may only be for hardcore sci-fi fans, viewers of MST3K and those in need of a good nap.

You say you want MORE of these? Well then-- BRENTWOOD's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GALACTICA-10-Movie-Pack/dp/B0000AKY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GALACTICA 10 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;is just what you're looking for!
