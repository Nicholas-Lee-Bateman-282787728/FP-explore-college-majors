7865685,2,6304230982,"The movie itself is mediocre but this is the edited version [Despite having one of the original titles of the movie]. The majority of the nudity is taken out. It also isn't going to satisfy people looking for a Blaxploitation movie, as it isn't really what I would put in that genre [Despite having a couple good black actors, including the lovely Marilyn Joi, whose nude scenes IS included]. I'd recommend you pick up the version known as The Possession of Nurse Sherri. It comes with an audio commentary and is uncut.",1398470400,2,519,4.6521739130434785
7865686,2,6304230982,"No one watches an Al Adamson movie with high expectations, but the director has been known to turn out some entertaining movies despite modest talents and miniscule budgets. With ""Black Voodoo,"" things get off to a promising start as we join a religious cult out in the Southern California desert (I've only recently started watching Adamson's work, but it seems like ALL his movies start in the SoCal desert). At the guidance of their leader, Reanhaur (toothy Bill Roy), cult members are trying to bring a dead member back to life by chanting ""Rise, William, rise!"" Then Reanhaur suffers a heart attack. Rather than chant ""Rise, Reanhauer, rise,"" an ambulance is called. But the old kook dies on the operating table. His body may be dead, but Reanhauer's spirit is very much alive. After Sherri (Jill Jacobson)--a nurse at the hospital where the cult leader was taken--is left alone by her doctor/boyfriend, an animated green blob emerges through Sherri's bedroom door and has its way with her. Perhaps the worst special effect ever for its time, this scene in which Sherri gets possessed is the movie's laugh-out-loud high point.

Things go downhill from there. Possessed by the Reanhaur's spirit, Sherri goes on a killing spree that would make Andy Milligan proud. Her doctor/boyfriend (whiny-voiced Geoffrey Land) thinks she's having an affair, but a blinded football player (Prentiss Moulden) who was raised by--get this--a voodoo priestess knows what Sherri's *real* problem is. He knows how to stop Sherri, if Nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi), who's got the hots for him, is willing to do some grave robbing for the good of mankind.

Supposedly this movie was originally conceived as a ripoff of Roger Corman's sexploitation pic ""The Student Nurses,"" but after producer Sam Sherman saw ""Carrie"" he decided to turn this into a horror movie. To make room for the spooky stuff, the sex scenes were cut, which explains why all the nurses in ""Black Voodoo"" are particularly libidinous (""Beth, you want to put Ed's stethoscope back in his pants?""), yet seldom act on their spoken desires. It probably explains why the busty Jacobson got the lead: She was expected to open her blouse, not her mouth. Unfortunately with the new horror story, she has to summon up some emotions but is unable to find any. Land, who delivers all his lines as if making an aspirin commercial, isn't much better. And it's obvious scenes were made with minimal takes as there are several instances were actors stumble over their lines. The pace is leaden through much of the movie (sex scenes were cut to make room for Reanhaur's three-minute ambulance ride?), and there is one scene that's so dark the viewer has no clue what's going on. With this type movie I expect bad acting, silly dialog and ridiculous narratives, but I can't forgive its being boring. And to think this was actually a hit with drive-in audiences!

Furthermore, ""Black Voodoo"" isn't really blaxploitation. Oh, there are some African American characters (and Xenon Entertainment is sure to use all their pictures on the box cover), but they're supporting players. No, this was originally titled ""Nurse Sherri,"" and just retitled to get a few extra dollars from black audiences. The movie has been retitled again, as ""The Possession of Nurse Sherri,"" in its DVD incarnation and is perhaps the better version to see. Not only does it feature commentary by Sam Sherman, but the disc also includes an unreleased cut of the movie featuring the excised sex scenes. Maybe that cut restores the movie's entertainment value as well.",1088640000,4,3564,4.976510067114094
