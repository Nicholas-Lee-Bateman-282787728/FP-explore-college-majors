8015048,5,B0001NBO60,"This was the TV pilot of the Robert Stack Most Wanted TV series that lasted from 76 to 77. It was well made
with many actors that became famous like Tom Selleck in one of his first series and plays a computer geek?
and not used as you would think and a cameo by Joyce DeWitt before 3's company which was also produced
by Aaron Spelling. This is a good pilot with a mentally disturbed man killing nuns. I'm surprised this show didn't
last because this pilot is so much better than most cop shows of the day. I remember the series but I don't
recall any episodes since I was too young back then. This is a must for fans of good classic cop shows.",1401148800,,644,4.119047619047619
8015049,2,B0001NBO60,"The Mayor of L.A. assigns Robert Stack to head a team to catch a nun-killer but since the killer's identity is known to the audience from the very beginning, there's not much suspense here, and even a pro like director Walter Grauman can't overcome the script's distasteful quality. A young Tom Selleck plays a cop but he's not allowed to fully display his talents. (In other words, he keeps his clothes on.)",1115251200,4,408,4.680555555555555
