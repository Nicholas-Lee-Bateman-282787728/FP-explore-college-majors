2472807,5,B000CSK8YS,"I've seen a ton of animal attack/creature feature movies, and I've NEVER seen anything like this.  Offensive, wild, over-the-top, thrill-a-minute, and containing that special grimy Italian charm horror fans love.  I was watching the whole movie with wide shocked eyes.  It's not intelligent.  It simply delivers what it promises: zoo animals hopped up on PCP attacking people in gory, action-packed ways.

Despite some offensive things, I found this one to be highly entertaining.  I didn't expect to be so blown away by the insanity of it all.  This is a must see, folks.  The nice twisted ending also propels this movie over many standard animal attack features.

5/5.",1486771200,6,670,5.12962962962963
2472808,4,B000CSK8YS,"This one is easily one of the nuttiest, most insane Italian exploitation movies ever made.  In fact, I don't think this 1984 flick was ever released in the United States until now--although it did circulate pretty widely in bootlegs of varying quality.  The story concerns PCP somehow getting into the water supply of a large European city.  This causes the animals in the local zoo to go crazy and when the new electronic cage system malfunctions the animals escape and go on a rampage through the city.

One notable sequence has a pair of young lovers in a car getting eaten alive by a horde of crazed rats.  Those rats are later torched alive by police in what doesn't appear to be a special effect.  Another standout scene has an unfortunate woman in an underpowered convertible trying desperately to outrun a cheetah.  That sequence somehow manages to be completely ridiculous and extremely suspenseful at the very same time.

Things take an even darker turn when it's revealed that animals aren't the only ones driven crazy by the PCP-laced drinking water.

Wild Beasts is likely a love it or hate it film.  The premise is ludicrous.  The violence over the top and occasionally pretty tasteless.  The acting and dialogue aren't likely to impress anyone.  But the movie has a crazy verve that makes it undeniably compelling--it's nervy, crazy and bizarre, one of those very rare films that has to be seen to be believed.",1486771200,7,1425,4.814814814814815

2472812,3,B000CSK8YS,"Not bad.

Not GOOD.

But not bad. This is a film I bought based on a review *I* read for it some years ago, and maybe it is because I am older now than I was then, but the reality didn't make up for the anticipation.

The telling story of what happens when PCP gets mixed in to a cities (Zoo's) water supply and makes the animals go mad. It has some frighting scenes in it (Elephants bursting through a brick wall among other things) but there are also plot holes big enough to drive a circus train through.

My advice? If you are not expecting anything that a mildly gorey, completely brain dead romp with critters high on crack who have the munchies for human meat, then go for it. Warning though, this one also has child nudity and violent death.",1191196800,4,749,4.253521126760563

8101766,3,B000CSK8YS,"Wild Beasts is similar to Cannibal Holocaust: it's a fine example of exploitation cinema, but it has moral flaws that diminish the experience.

Like CH, it's about humanity's cruelty to nature, and it inflicts real cruelty on some of the animals onscreen.

Spoilers and I don't care: Rats are torched and stamped on, a hyena bites a pig and a lion attacks a bovid in controlled settings, and rats gang up on a cat that might be bleeding for real.

To analyze the movie further requires the compartmentalization of these facts.

...

OK.

Otherwise, it's trippy, unsettling, gory, tasteless, audacious, goofy, and effective. There are several stunning scenes, including a graceful cheetah chase. The scan and restoration on the latest blu-ray are top-tier, part of a growing trend in the HD home release market. This is hackwork at its most exciting. Itll blow your mind. That saxophone...

Back to serious stuff.

There are more controversies. WB has a brief shot of pre-pubescent nudity, which, in the context of trash, can be seen as sexualizing. Could it be something else? Maybe. Given the effort by the filmmakers to send a messagepiles of needles litter subway escalators, the director depicts the PCP-laced water systems of the city with the skill of a tenth-rate Godfrey Reggio, a middle-aged man rants against automation, theres a speech at a Darwin Conference about natures vengeance on mankind for enslaving the Earth, a ballet dancer acts like a dying swan, humans die brutally by the paws of predatorsI can view it as a glimpse of the wild child, life before it is civilized. The shot is brief, because the girl buttons on a shirtas the singer of the song on the radio says jungle beating feelingand answers a ringing door, all while running late for dance lessons. She leaves a voice message for her mother, thanking her for the recorded reminders of what to do for the day. What would Suzy do without mom? Perhaps shell kill somebody

The other controversy is a panning/zoom shot of young dance students supinely stretching their legs. The slow pan drew our eyes to the one boy among the girls (hes about to do something). By this point our gaze is practiced on a lurid spectacle; again, its not surprising that this shot would be interpreted as pedophilic cinematography, but thats not the case.

8101767,1,B000CSK8YS,"When you have a 7 year old running around in her underwear with a teenagers voice - you know this flick is wrong.  Not only is this offensive in a big time way I'm surprised it  ever made it off the shelf.  This movie shows animals (real) being tortured for the sake of making movie and it's not cool.  Once I saw the tiger having a seizure for the sake of this film it was turn the vid off time.  Folks - this is an all around joke in bad taste.

8101768,4,B000CSK8YS,"This is the tender, joy-filled tale of what happens when PCP is introduced to the drinking water of zoo animals, driving them all bananas. Cuddly critters abound, cutely devouring their human snacks, after an elephant destroys the electronic cage-locking system, causing a mass exodus!. From the infamous ""rat attack"" and ""elephant car-stomping"" scenes, to the all-out shred-a-thon of the big cats' feeding frenzy, WILD BEASTS (1984) makes other creature features like GRIZZLY or DAY OF THE ANIMALS appear absolutely timid! Unfortunately, as w/ many Italian gore films of the era, animal cruelty seems to have been a prerequisite, sending several real animals to their premature, unnecessary doom. Still, as ludicrous as it all is, WB does manage to be entertaining throughout its 90 minute run time. Some of the more memorable scenes show a cheetah, a polar bear, cattle, etc. on the move down city streets or school hallways! Starring Lorraine De Selle (MADNESS, HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK, CANNIBAL FEROX, WOMEN'S PRISON MASSACRE) as Laura, and  John Aldrich (this was his only movie) as Rupert. Recommended for all lovers of such films...  P.S.- Nothing can prepare you for the ""shock"" finale!...",1494201600,2,1203,5.195876288659794

8101770,4,B000CSK8YS,"In a day and age where computers can generate the majority of what we see on the silver screen, I am extremely thankful for those directors who choose practical special effects over CG.  No matter how good the CG is, I can usually tell whats real and whats not (pretty much the sole exception to this is Neill Blomkamps workhis CG is amazingly realistic).  My preference for real-world effects is one of the reasons I love 80s horror so much.  Obviously, CG was not prominent back then, and extremely expensive; thus, it was used in only a handful of films.  Filmmakers had to get quite ingenious at times to accomplish the shots they wanted in their movies.

WILD BEASTS is an Italian horror flick that fits this bill.  The film deals with nature gone amuck, thanks to drugs polluting the zoos water supply.  It boasts all practical effects, and I have to confess it contains some of the most chilling animal attacks Ive ever seen.  Granted, the dialogue is kinda hokey, and some of the situations seem a tad ridiculous (a cheetah tries to run down a woman who is speeding away in her car)but if you can look past that, you're in for a real treat.

Despite its small flaws, this film kept me captivated from start to finish.  From the first animal attack on, I was hooked.  I can see why this has been an underground cult favorite for so long.

WILD BEASTS is shot well and looks great onscreen, thanks to the HD transfer.  The Blu-ray picture is crisp and clear, and I cant recall a single grainy scene.  Likewise, the sound is impressive.  My surround sound made good use of the ambient noises, offering an immersive viewing experience all the way around.

The acting is about what youd expect from Italian horror from those days:  its not terrible, but its nothing to write home about either.  This is probably due in part to the lackluster writing (as mentioned, the dialogue is clunky and hokey in places), but it is easily forgivable.  I enjoyed watching the cast get eaten as a result.

And speaking of carnage, theres plenty of it in WILD BEASTS.  The animal attacks are gruesome and very realistic, as is the gore.  When these animals take a person down, its for good.  They waste no time in ripping out throats and mauling their victims in a frenzy of crimson.  One particular scene that really made me squirm involves a couple making out in a car.  They are lost in each other and do not notice the massive horde of rats that are sneaking up on them.  They realize what is happening as the rodents attack, but it is too late; the couple are basically eaten alive, one small bite at a time.  This scene is horrific and gruesome, a fitting dose of gore for a film like this.

WILD BEASTS is a win for me, and I definitely recommend giving it a look.  The film is chocked full of intensity and all-out craziness, but it is a heck of a ride.",1491868800,,2849,4.456479690522244

There is an awesome chase scene through the city involving a cheetah that was awesome. The picture and sound quality was astounding. You will never see this movie look better. Severin did a great job on the blu ray. Plenty of extras for all you movie buffs. Lots of gore for you gorehounds.

8101773,3,B000CSK8YS,"The Italian film industry was never just content to spot a trend, they had to top it!  Everything from westerns to gothic horror to sex comedies were emulated and then exaggerated to offensive extremes.  Case in point, Franco Posperi's Wild Beasts (1983) which doesn't just choose one species to let loose upon mankind, but an entire zoo full of PCP-crazed animals!  Though it's a bit late to the ""nature run amok"" party, the film sends the sub-genre out with an unforgettable highlight reel of rats, cats, cheetahs, elephants and polar bears out for blood.

Prosperi himself was already a legend in exploitation history, having been responsible for the Mondo film craze - a series of fearlessly shocking and titillating travelogues that later inspired ill-conceived copycats like Faces of Death - with co-director Gualtiero Jacopetti.  Here he's working under equally dangerous circumstances with the same intent:  to capture something onscreen that has never been seen before.  And in that respect, Wild Beasts most certainly delivers.

Working from a rough plot that doesn't little more than introduce potential victims, the film takes place in a nameless northern European city where zookeeper Rupert Berner (John Aldrich) begins to notice some unusual behavior from his favorite lion.  The mania quickly spreads and an all-out jailbreak results after a trio of elephants smash the main gates.  As Rupert and his journalist girlfriend attempt to slow things down, test results show that PCP in the animals' water supply is the cause of the carnage.  But can the panicked citizens survive until the effects of the drug wear off...and, if so, what will be left of them!?

Sharing the same urban setting as Michael Wadleigh's Wolfen, Wild Beasts doesn't bother with political subplots or Native American hocus-pocus; it's simply one gory attack scene after another, some amusingly ridiculous (who knew elephants were so mean-spirited!) and others so technically impressive you'll be dying to learn how it was done (three words:  cheetah vs. car).  What's even more amazing is that all of this was staged with no computer assistance, using real animals in often incredibly dangerous situations.  In an era where it seems even the most innocuous wildlife used in movies is created entirely with CG, Wild Beasts ranks as one of the most ambitious exploitation movies ever.

That said, it's not much more than the sum of its parts.  A surprise ending pops up just as things are getting repetitive and, upon reflection, even the most cold-hearted viewer will probably cringe at the PETA-unfriendly treatment a swarm of rats receives early on.  Noel Marshall's Roar (1981) is still probably the tops when it comes to footage that will make your jaw drop.  But Wild Beasts gets the edge on sheer variety alone.

Severin Films gives all this outrageousness a suitably special hi-def debut, starting with a very nice transfer that had to be a challenge considering most of the movie is set after dark.  Extras include interviews with Prosperi, editor Mario Morra, Carlo Tiberti, son animal wrangler Carlo Tiberti, actor Tony Di Leo, along with the international trailer.",1487203200,2,3162,5.148727984344423
