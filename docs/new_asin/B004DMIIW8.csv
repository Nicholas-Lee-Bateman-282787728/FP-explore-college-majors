4333304,1,B004DMIIW8,"Here's a thought: don't start near the end of the story. Berserk pulled it off--but it started after everyone got killed. Even When They Cry did a better job. It was difficult to watch this show because the first two episodes kill everyone off. Then it goes back in time and your expected to give a darn about the characters. Well, I didn't find this entertaining. Maybe I'll watch it again in a few years, but for now there's a really rank taste left in my mouth...",1311379200,8,466,4.367816091954023
4333305,5,B004DMIIW8,"well where do i start , i started watching ga rei zero on demand on funimation because i have com cast ! i watch the first episode because it was free , then i got addicted to it and watch the 2nd episode so i waste a lil bit of money ,then i stop ..so i end up buying the blu-ray dvd !!!11and the best part is on sale!!!!!!so right away i wanted to get it , you see i am a otaku well not that much but yeah , and i always wanted to buy it but it would be like 50$ for 12 episode's that wasn't worth to waste a lot , i could have buy another anime that includes 30 episode for 50$ well my point is to get it because is on low price to 25$!!!!!!!!!!!!that's awesome!!!!!",1311206400,,669,3.75177304964539
4333306,5,B004DMIIW8,"I really didn't know what to expect from this series. I hadn't heard much about it, only the little clips I stumbled across on youtube. I had thought at first that it was a Yuri, so I avoided it. (Just not my thing.) It wasn't until I read a couple of reviews that I realized that it wasn't.

What it turned out to be was a wonderful and bittersweet story that combines action, humor and love, and love in it's different forms. The beautiful sisterly relationship between Yomi and Kagura, the romantic love and also the love for family.

The animation is fantastic. Beautiful artwork with fluid motions. Less 'freeze frames' during the action scenes than you would see in older anime. You actually get to see the fighting rather than a character brandishing a sword with a fierce look on their face, the frame freezing and then seeing the defeated 'baddy' on the ground.

I watched the dub version of this, and it is probably one of the best I've seen. I was especially impressed with the performance of Kagura's VA. She did a brilliant job. Especially in the last episode. It's an extremely emotional episode and she did beautifully showing the myriad of emotions that the character goes through. (Though she was amazing, the rest of the VAs gave top notch performances as well.)

Overall, a wonderful series.  Action, love, comedy... You'll find all of it in this series. Definitely worth your time and money.

Oh and a warning. I believe it says there is only ""mild nudity"". That isn't precisely true. The two girls bath together and there is full nudity. It is brief though, and nothing offensive.",1303948800,20,1601,4.679715302491103
4333307,4,B004DMIIW8,"I have to give them credit for beginning this series with a bold stroke that makes you say, what just happened here. While you're still reeling from the sucker punch they take you back in time to introduce the main characters of the story. I thought the character development for the main two characters was really good. Other characters, not so good. But all the while I keep going back to that shocking first episode in my mind, and thinking if they pull off justifying this it would be pretty amazing. Unfortunately, although it was pretty good, I felt the ending didn't come close to balance the previous injustices of the story. I was especially frustrated by the young lead character who seem to take too long to come to the obvious conclusion that would've prevented a couple of needless massacres if she had done so. Okay she's just a teenager but she was raised her entire life for this job so she should've been more prepared for it. Don't get me wrong I actually like this series, and I really cared for the two main characters. In fact my caring for these characters is what made me want the ending to be even more satisfying for them.",1302998400,3,1147,4.519230769230769
4333308,5,B004DMIIW8,"I watched this show a while back when it appeared on hulu and overall was very impressed. I went into this knowing absolutly nothing about the original source material and what I found was a concise and satisfying storyline with excellent animation. Like all anime this show does contain some elements that are a little outlandish, one scene in particular towards the end of the series was completely ridiculous, but this aspect is kept to an absolute minimum. Where Garie Zeros really hits is in the emotional impact of the of the bonds formed between the two main charcters and the horrible realities of the events surrounding them. Although the conclusion becomes obvious before the end arrives, and some holes are left open leading into the manga, this is easily one of the most streamlined stories I have encountered in recent history. In short this is a good show for anyone looking for a show that delivers both intense action and a excellent character devolpment without the commitment of a long series held down by filler and other useless side material.",1296086400,38,1063,4.878453038674033
4333309,5,B004DMIIW8,"Note: This is a review of the anime series and not this particular package deal, because it was written before the deal was available for purchase.

This anime series is a prelude the the storyline of Ga-Rei. It offers solid action, friendship development, character complexity/development, animation quality, and emotional impact. Its soundtrack did not particularly stand out as well as the voice acting. The 3-dimensional animation seems quite poor for the current standards (there is not much of this). There are 12 episodes total and all are normal TV episode length. Warning that the first two episodes are nearly all action, but the third episode begins the main story. The ending to the anime is very predictable due to it being a prelude to Ga-Rei and due to the manor in which the anime presents itself.  Overall this anime is for people who are interested in seeing an action packed story of the friendship between two sisters.

Reviewer note: Yumi, who is one of the main characters in this anime, is one of my personal favorite anime characters of all time.",1295913600,24,1070,4.900552486187845

4333341,5,B004DMIIW8,"Follow the story about demon hunters for the 21 century. Yes there is magic and swords, but plenty of bullets to go around too. The first two episodes kind of leave you wanting more. In my top ten must watch anime series.",1397088000,,221,4.285714285714286
4333342,3,B004DMIIW8,"Ga Rei Zero was a pleasant surprise.  It's a story about an elite unit of evil spirit vanquishers.  They are the classic motley crew of anime cool.  There are the twins with big guns, the guy with drills on his hands, a machinegun-suitcases wielding smack talker, the ladies man with killer ferrets, and our fem fatale, katana drawing duet.

This series tries to follow in the vein of ""Berserk"", where the story starts at the end, we see some tragic affairs, and then the rest of narrative focuses on how we got there.

The animation is above what I expected as the action is well choreographed with very few gimmicks and shortcuts.  The violence is there in all its scarlet glory, but is not excessive.  The characters are fun and almost deep.

Where this show falls short of 4 stars, is in the concept it's trying to champion.  ""Berserk"" left almost all of the puzzle pieces a mystery so that uncovering the past was rewarding at every turn, and the relationships were highly detailed.  The final event also left a punch to the heart that was surprising, horrific, and nothing short of a Shakespearean level tragedy.  Ga Rei Zero shows you the betrayal and decimation of the team at the hands of Yomi in the first two episodes.  Even going back to the beginning, the audience already knows that we're on a journey to see the two friends fight to the death.

We're expected to be satisfied examining the glue formed between Yomi and blameless Kagura.  Don't get me wrong, it's there, but the creators weren't very creative in showing why they're so close beyond some quick ""You're my sister"" declarations and shared sob stories. To follow that standard ""forming of a bound"" is Yomi's turn to darkness which is about as deep as what George Lucas did with Vader.  A little anger here, accepting the use of some dark power there and where done.  Fight to death!

All in all, you know where this is going from start to finish.  This is a good story, good animation, and has some likable characters, but is predictable and leaves nothing to the imagination.  This is still a safe buy and an entertaining viewing experience.  The best news is that it's gone under the radar and hasn't received a lot of support from American audiences so it's a perfect candidate for S.A.V.E.

If it slips to S.A.V.E. it will be one of the best titles they have.  It's nowhere close to groundbreaking but I would recommend it without hesitation to most.  This is a good, solid show that doesn't over stay its welcome.  Ga Rei Zero is a safe bet.  Enjoy!",1387929600,,2531,4.583518930957684

4333346,5,B004DMIIW8,"Great Anime series. Love how it starts the first two episodes basically at the end of the series, then throws a cliffhanger at you. At that point it goes back to tell the story from the beginning. Great animation. Cool characters, and also a little dark at times. BluRay and DVD discs both included for all your media needs.

4333347,3,B004DMIIW8,"I actually had to go look at the boxes to remember what it was about and it hasn't been a month since I got it. The story is good and has some different ideas on spirit creatures, but nothing overly new. Probably what made it least memorable was the ""artsy"" style of showing a less complete version of the ending as the first two episodes then backtracking to fill in the story. Many fans may find this interesting as a format, but I've seen it done better. Spoiler: don't get attached to the characters in the first episode, they won't be around in the second beyond the recap...",1362614400,,580,4.37962962962963

4333349,5,B004DMIIW8,The series was absolutely wonderful to watch. I'll admit I was a little teary eyed when Yomi and Kagura were in the hospital. I felt bad for Yomi when she tried calling out for Kagura and couldn't and she was constantly typing on her cell phone that she was sorry. I loved the series and would recommend it to anyone. The packaging was Funimations first at blu-ray DVD release with a nice box. Sadly the box wasn't chipboard like they use nowadays but still nicely done.,1358294400,,470,4.476744186046512
4333350,5,B004DMIIW8,"I watched this on Netflix a while back and I'd never heard of it before. In fact, it just sat there on my anime list to watch for probably a couple of months before I got really bored and finally started it. Once I got started though, I couldn't stop myself from watching. The story pulls you in and although after the first couple of episodes you know how crazy things are gonna get, you find yourself wanting to keep going, a marathon viewing. The story builds its characters well and the action scenes are fierce and gritty and often times painful to watch...but you can't look away. It's that kind of story. You know after a few episodes where it's going, but you find yourself wanting to keep with it till the very end. Keep in mind there is a manga for this anime so if you want to keep the story going after this ends, check it out for more.",1358208000,,848,4.2407407407407405

Kagura and Yomi both come from families with enormous responsibilities. Battling evil with their spiritual powers. They form a bond of sisterhood and live to protect each other from the evil lurking in the darkness. But a light that shines so brightly attracts attention of a dark shadow. Immense tragedy befalls the 2 sisters and destroys their lives. I was really upset over the awful things that happen to them. But I was impressed by strength of their love. I really enjoyed watching Ga-Rei-Zero but Good Grief it's sad.",1348963200,,674,4.818965517241379
4333352,5,B004DMIIW8,I tend to lean toward a particular genre of anime Shonen with swords. I clicked on this anime one night looking for something new and I was hooked within minutes. There is little or no moe and the story is very fresh and solid. The artwork is gorgeous which is why I purchased the DVD package. The quality of the package and discs is very good. I suggest that this is a great addition to your collection.,1343433600,,404,4.259740259740259
4333353,1,B004DMIIW8,"This isn't so much a review as a fair warning to anyone, who like me, does not enjoy tragedy for tragedy's own sake. I loved everything about this anime except the ending. It's pretty awful. I sat there waiting and hoping for some type of redemption, but it never comes. Wish I never watched it. Left me with a sick feeling in my stomach.",1339200000,6,338,4.296875
4333354,5,B004DMIIW8,"That's the title quote for this gut wrenching anime If you've ever loved and lost someone
Then this will really hurt In a good way
Forget the epic battles magic ghosts demons swordplay big guns destruction poky sticks awesome anime bloody deaths
Just think of this
What would you do if you failed someone so completely that it changed their life
How would you make it up to them
What would you do to put it right
What would you give to protect them and keep them safe from you

This anime tells that story but Its very cryptic and confusing at first
Starts at the end them jumps back to the start at episode 3 so stay with it till the end you won't be let down
Now it is the prequel to a manga of a similar name but I feel its good enough to stand on its own",1334707200,,758,4.0198675496688745
4333355,4,B004DMIIW8,"Yep, almost didn't watch it because it opened with 5 or 6 characters I thought were pretty cool and then proceeded to do something I didn't expect.

In any event, the series is a prequel to a manga series that has concluded (after 12 volumes), and this is the backstory to that manga.  You don't need to know the manga (I didn't), to enjoy the story, so definitely recommend this one.

There is mild nudity, could have done without the nude bathing scene and occasionally forced hints at lesbianism, but other than that, solid series, great plot, excellent voice acting, well-animated, and a good combination of both action and the humanity that drives all the characters.",1332374400,2,672,4.775862068965517
4333356,4,B004DMIIW8,"This anime isn't really a stand alone and it wasn't meant to be.  Its based off the Ga-Rei Manga Series as a prequal to it.

The Animation in this anime is absolutely stunning.  They did an excellent job putting the sequences together.

The plot is depressing the end is depressing but its the story prequal to the Manga and really completed to prelude it assuming fans would be familiar with the Manga series.

Overall, they did an outstanding job on this anime series.  Though as a stand alone without the Manga its only okay.  And yes I watched the Anime first than read the Manga.",1324944000,,584,4.504761904761905
4333357,3,B004DMIIW8,"The animation in this show is top notch, and the visuals are engaging.  There is lots of relationship going on among the main characters.  That said, it is also very depressing.  Every episode begins with the question ""Will you kill person you love because you love them?"" so I am not really giving any spoilers here. They spend the entire series developing the relationships and showing you that the people love one another.  Then they have to turn around and chop the others to bits because they are possessed by evil spirits.  All the violence happens on screen, so you see a lot of blood, sword cuts, and limbs being cut off.  In the end, the person who is causing all this trouble and releasing the evil spirits isn't even caught.  I supposed that that leaves the door open for a sequel.

I just looked at the Amazon header at the top of the page for this and it says that it is rated G.  Don't believe it. It should be rated R.",1323734400,3,933,4.3468208092485545
4333358,3,B004DMIIW8,"Let me ruin it for you now, the series begins by showing you the very near end of the story. While in itself that is not a bad thing, it is bad in this instance because after two episodes of showing the very near end of the story you are already confused because the two first episodes are very confusing since nothing is really explained as to what is happening. After the first two episodes comes the third which drops you in the very beginning of the story which really confuses you since the beginning is the origin of the characters and how they grow into what they do. Once you get 7-8 episodes into the series it begins to make sense. After watching the series I kinda feel like I have been cheated out of good money because it was criminally short and the first two episodes while action packed and tragic, are repeated later in the series. So while it may list the series as having 12 episodes, in reality it is really 10 episodes. So, for the price I cannot in good faith recommend this as a purchase but as a rental or streaming series I say go for it. And if you decide to stream from episode 3 til the end, you will probably enjoy it a lot better. The quality of the animation was pretty good and the voice acting was pretty good also. Be aware that somewhere in the middle of the series there is a little nudity of a questionable nature as it was made very clear that one of the partially nude women was in high school.",1319500800,4,1433,4.214545454545455
4333359,5,B004DMIIW8,"I went into Ga Rei Zero not knowing anything about the name, or the series. Starting off with an action packed opening Ga Rei Zero introduces a whole host of characters, with some spectacular sequences and action packed events that set the tone of the show, and tries to ease you into the frantic situation these characters are facing at the time. After of which. after a certain event happens, the anime changes gears and tells the tale of 2 girls, Kagura and Yomi and how things ended up the way they are.

Some people may get turned off by the way the anime changes focus completely after an eye popping opening that literally grabs you and never lets you go, keeping you at the edge of your seat even, but I think its a welcome change of pace.

The story introduces the characters, who they are, what they do, their backstories, and allows you the viewer to experience events as they unfold.

I like the way this anime is downright shocking with some of the stuff it prevents, from one character brutally murdering someone, to crazy events that seem unreal when watching.

For fans of Drama you get plenty of this in the anime.

I found the characters likable when watching, the animation is really good, as is the English dub, and the Japanese audio too.

This anime quite adult with its violence I would say. Keep in mind if you're buying as a gift for a teenager, or a young adult.",1315440000,,1388,4.466403162055336
8425694,4,B004DMIIW8,"Otaku John, the super-fan of Anime, Light Novels, and Manga, here to review another interesting anime series, ""Ga-Rei Zero.""  This is one of those animes you either love or hate, and is good, but not great.  First off, I'd like to say that the S.A.V.E. edition is a great bargain, and definitely worth the price.  The animation is awesome, the storyline is very good, and it hooks you right in, and the characters are all likable and interesting.  But unfortunately, it suffers from a lack of full development.  I think if this series would've been expanded to double the episodes, it would've had the room to fully develop the plot into a great story line.  The last few episodes feel rushed, and in the end you're left wanting more just as it's getting really interesting.  However, this series is still definitely worth the watch, if you love action / horror genre and you love seeing Japanese demons and monsters being slain.  This series isn't in the same league with ""Hellsing"" or ""Devil May Cry"" or ""Gantz"", but it certainly does entertain.",1515456000,,1047,4.745856353591161

8425697,2,B004DMIIW8,"I gave this show a shot because it was recommended to me and was supposedly underrated and had supernatural elements. I am a huge fan of anything with ghosts, zombies, monsters, blood and guts, so when I finished the first episode, my jaw dropped and I thought to myself, ""Finally another decent horror anime!"" Sadly, I would turn out to be wrong.

The two main characters are likeable enough at first but later on, one of them pulls the whole,  ""I don't wanna kill a zombie that would totally have no qualms about eating me in a second because it was once human and it would make me sad. Never mind the fact that the world as we know it is suddenly falling apart and IT IS LITERALLY MY JOB TO KILL THEM. Oh, and I have been training my whole life for this purpose."" I absolutely hate it when shows do stuff like that. Maybe I am a little desensitized because I have seen way too many anime cover the subject of internal struggle in the same way. Other people may not find it to be as annoying.

 So starting around episode 4 the show barely stays interesting enough to keep you watching. I kept thinking to myself, ""Okay, maybe if I just watch one more, it will get better like the first few episodes."" But NOPE. It stays consistently mediocre. I hate that I can't outright say that this show is just bad. It has a few cool moments and neat fight scenes sprinkled with some gore. The writing isn't bad either. It's just that when I compare it to the likes of other horror anime like Shiki, When They Cry, Another and a few more incredible shows I've had the pleasure of watching, it seems to be just....okay I guess.

To wrap it up, maybe if you go in with low expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised. But definitely do not get your hopes up for this one.",1475020800,,1764,4.317220543806647
