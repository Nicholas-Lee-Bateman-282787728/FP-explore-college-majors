7802693,4,6165001750,"When I first saw this I thought it might be another light warm-hearted drama about the passion of making great food. I was wrong, there is way more to this show. From the very first episode there are so many dramatic twists and turns in each episode that you won't be able to wait to see what happens next. This drama has serious competition, deception, secrets, betrayal, revenge, romance, comedy, family, and so many other elements that revolves around the traditional food of a top notch restaurant.",1384819200,2,502,4.781609195402299
