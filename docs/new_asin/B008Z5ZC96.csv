8532967,5,B008Z5ZC96,"I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the band members (except Jim Denton, who was a member from 1974 - 1987 but was strangely absent) reminisce about their beginnings and shed a little light into the experience of their formation, recording, touring, and what it all meant to them ultimately.  I've always loved these guys (and Wendy!) for being so raw and real, and I admire them greatly.  Nothing visually compelling here in this DVD, just the band sitting at a table talking, interspersed with some photos of them, particularly in their early days.",1425772800,,543,4.956043956043956
8532968,4,B008Z5ZC96,This was interesting. They shared a lot of detail about the early days of Rez and JPUSA. Its too bad they didn't get into a lot of detail about the days between the first live album and Lament.,1389139200,2,193,4.105263157894737
