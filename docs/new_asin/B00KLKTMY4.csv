6433441,1,B00KLKTMY4,"Some of the reviews indicated the video quality might not be too good because of compressing five movies on one DVD.  They need to talk more about the quality of the content, which had little redeeming to it.  Ughhhhhh,...I was hoping there would be at least one gem here but they were all pretty awful.  Maybe the one about the bear might not quite get the F- but overall, a group of stinkers,....",1447027200,6,398,4.424657534246576

6433447,4,B00KLKTMY4,"I have not watched all of the movies on this 5-Movie collection yet and am only reviewing Croc: Godzilla of the Swamp. Croc is an excellent horror movie. Contains realistic croc footage which makes the movie psychologically frightening and not just a gore fest. The story line is involving, intense, and full bodied for a B horror flick. The thought of a live victim being dragged underwater and into this beast's cave is chilling and not far fetched. Michael Madsen is awesome, as always. While there is almost always one annoying story character to detest, I found the entire cast of Croc to be good actors and likable characters - even the villians with their sarcastic, dark humor and evil ways.  I enjoyed the exotic locale and lush scenery as well, which added to the mood. The concept of the crocodile farmer being blamed for the massacres was plausible. The family angle and their struggle added to the emotional lure of the movie. I would definitely recommend Croc to anyone interested in an exciting adventure movie which is more than just an average horror flick. I look forward to watching and reviewing the other titles in this collection.",1437868800,4,1152,4.818181818181818
6433448,4,B00KLKTMY4,I had actually seen one of the movies (Croc - Godzilla of the Swamp) on this set and ordered the cd for that one movie because I could not find it alone.  I have not watched any of the others on the cd but may some day.,1437609600,,219,3.6595744680851063
6433449,3,B00KLKTMY4,Very good for an addition to any DVD collection,1436832000,,47,4.333333333333333
6433450,5,B00KLKTMY4,"I love the Maneater Collection, unfortunately, though the movies in this collection are good, the transfer to DVD is not. On every movie, there's a dotted white line across the top. Kind of like what you would see on a VHS tape. This is probably caused by the fact that all 5 movies are on a single one-sided DVD. I enjoyed the movies very much, just not the quality.",1435190400,11,367,4.333333333333333

6433453,2,B00KLKTMY4,"If you like horrible B-movies (yeah, that's redundant) where Things Eat People, this is an inexpensive way to get five of them. Please keep in mind that they're all crammed onto one disc. The low definition/pixilation is distracting.",1428537600,15,233,5.157894736842105
6433454,5,B00KLKTMY4,Good movie,1428278400,,10,4.5
6433455,1,B00KLKTMY4,"Five movies.  Wow!  What they fail to tell you is that they are incredibly compressed to have 5 movies fit on one disc.  With the price of blank media so cheap these days, their is no need to spit on would-be customers by providing them with inferior picture quality.  The greed of these is guys is reprehensible.",1425772800,12,313,4.43859649122807
