8133495,3,B000GNOSLI,"Love the band, but the dvd is overrated.  Probably doesn't capture the real life feel as well as it might.",1395878400,,106,4.3
8133496,5,B000GNOSLI,"I first saw this film on Ovation TV and I was hooked. The group The Tiger Lillies preform in New York. They are terrific. All the songs are original works. They (both the songs and the group) are dark, distubing and very true. The most distrubing of these is a song called ""Terrible"" about a man who knows he is terrible and enjoys it. Not for children based on content and the fact they won't understand it. Whether or not your into performance art ,you really should see this.",1200700800,5,478,4.382022471910112
8133497,5,B000GNOSLI,Shockheaded Peter is one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen and anybody that hasn't had the luck to see it live should get this wonderful DVD to be able to get an impression of their wonderful performance.,1178496000,5,213,4.35
