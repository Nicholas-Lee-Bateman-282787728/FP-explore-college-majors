8252623,4,B00004RZZ0,"I have this on DVD so I can't comment on this particular VHS tape quality.
What I like about this video collection is that it contains 6 songs (out of a total of 11 songs on this collection) from a single concert that I assume was performed in 1975 (or early 1976).
The songs are TOYS IN THE ATTIC - SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE - SWEET EMOTION - WALK THIS WAY - ADAM'S APPLE - TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN.
(The video closes with a smoking version of S.O.S [TOO BAD] but the song is cut short and not listed as one of the songs).
This performance is vintage Aerosmith (they were never the same ""live"" after 1976) and I hope someone has the common sense to go back to the original source tapes, add the other songs from the concert and re-master the video and sound. I guarantee it will become a classic (not to mention big seller).",1215734400,,818,4.150943396226415
