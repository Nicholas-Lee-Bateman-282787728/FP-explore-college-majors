7712092,5,B01DF3U6PW,Best series since THE WIRE.,1482192000,2,27,4.6
7712093,2,B01DF3U6PW,"Why, The first and second series were great. Very well done. The last episode in series 2 had a great conclusion. The story is over.
Besides the star Gillian Andersons character would be fired or not be involved anymore. So it's a farce. Why is she even there? Oh, she's the only one in the world that can do the job, Don't think so.",1481328000,,333,4.21875
7712094,2,B01DF3U6PW,"Watched this on Netflix.  Season 1 was good but the series went slowly downhill after that.  Anderson and Dornan are equally creepy in their roles.  Dornan is the serial killer and Anderson is the detective who brings him in.  Anderson is quite the provocative cop and it seems that every male wants to sleep with her. and rank does not get in her way. Most of her dialogue is done in a monotone mumble and there are very few changes in her facial expression.  She loves to control everyone, including the rookie cops involved in the case. She remains curiously detached from the horror of Dornan's actions and at times, I think she takes some sick pleasure in listening to Dornan talk about his murders..  Dornan is just as odd as the bereavement counselor/family man/serial killer whose only strong attachment seems to be with his young daughter.  Just a very unsettling series.",1480377600,4,880,4.75

7712096,1,B01DF3U6PW,"wourildnt know how season 3 was cause the dvd didn't work in my dvd player so i won't know how the series ends. always be sure you fine print if not, you get screwed.",1492992000,3,166,3.911764705882353
7712097,1,B01DF3U6PW,I can't give a review at this time. My dvd did not work and I have not ordered a new dvd.,1492646400,3,89,3.2857142857142856
7712098,5,B01DF3U6PW,"I love this series,",1491350400,,19,4.0
7712099,3,B01DF3U6PW,"Season 1 & 2 were fabulous. It's obvious season 3 was contractual and the writers didn't know what to do. Parts are so unrealistic it's laughable and the ending was a disappointment. Overall, great series, it's just sad to see it end this way. If you stop at two you'll be doing yourself a favor.",1489449600,2,296,4.4
7712100,5,B01DF3U6PW,;oved the series!,1487030400,,17,5.0
7712101,5,B01DF3U6PW,"Just saw all three seasons on Netflix. Clearly, one of the best things ever presented on TV. I cried twice during Season 3, Episode 6.",1486857600,2,134,4.4
7712102,1,B01DF3U6PW,I cannot play the DVDs on my recorder,1485475200,3,37,3.75
7712103,5,B01DF3U6PW,Not as spellbinding as the first 2 seasons but still excellent drama.,1483747200,2,69,4.833333333333333
7712104,3,B01DF3U6PW,"The first two seasons were brilliant, some of the best TV ever. The series could have ended there but there was a contract for a third season so the writers had to come up with something. It was overall good but not to the standards of drama of seasons 1 and 2.
Episode one is a treatise on how traumatic injuries are treated in an emergency room, and could be a good on line tutorial for trauma physicians. Very real to life but does little to advance the plot.
The Stella character mumbles and whispers throughout the entire six episodes, either with remarkable words of empathetic wisdom or over controlled rage. Her Hirsute and bearded colleague Jim Burns goes through the entire series with one expression, that of worried depression. he seems to have a stash of single serving liquor bottles (like you get on an airplane) which he swills in the bathroom or wherever when the going gets tough (which it always seems to be)
The Paul Spector character is always mumbling as well except when he's kicking butt which he does occasionally.
Then there's the psychiatrist, always unshaven and talking in a dull monotone but with a German accent for a little flavor and authenticity.
He expresses no emotion and seems depressed himself. Can't imagine he can help anyone get well.
The biggest laugher is the so called forensic mental hospital with dangerous patients who have unfettered access to pool cues, balls and the like and staff who see the patients with no security, violent patients locked in a room unfettered with no observation, no observable precautions, etc. No such place exists, (having worked in one myself) Whether in the USA or Belfast, the place would be closed down in a heartbeat.
Then, young handsome Sergeant Detective ( love all their fancy titles) Tom Anderson has a thing for middle aged cougar Stella, probably twice his age, who has little in the way of observable emotion or likability. Somewhat inexplicable.
Everyone else, the nitwit wife, the investigators, all with muted depression.
At least the story has a solid finale which I waited  for patiently, and was generally worth it.",1482451200,5,2111,4.847645429362881
8755817,5,B01DF3U6PW,Thoroughly enjoyed! Will be waiting for the next story with Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson.,1514764800,,99,6.142857142857143
8755818,5,B01DF3U6PW,Top notch acting and writing.  Gillian Anderson is fabulous and Jamie Dornan is simply fantastic; displays subtle nuances in his portrayal.,1509667200,2,139,5.619047619047619
8755819,1,B01DF3U6PW,I worked an investigative career and not squeamish but I question the need for such gruesome videos. I have interviewed four serial killers and do not recommend anyone with the slightest respect for human life to involve themselves with this sickening bideo series. I stopped watching it and return the 'unused portion' to Netflix. Don't buy this if you love children. The main actress is a one emotion (cold heart) event by the way.,1505088000,,433,4.864864864864865
8755820,5,B01DF3U6PW,Great show! However I couldn't watch the dvd on any of my DVD players. I finally tried my laptop and it worked thank goodness!,1501891200,3,126,4.291666666666667
8755821,5,B01DF3U6PW,Love all 3 seasons of The Fall!,1500076800,,31,3.5714285714285716
8755822,5,B01DF3U6PW,I am waiting for the DVD to hit the USA.  I have season 1 and 2 (region 1) and can't wait for it to be created in the format for USA  I have seen Season 3 on Netflix twice. In 50 Shades they said he could not act. He did a heck of a job being a serial killer.  The third series was not disappointing. Hubby and I love it. I hated to see it come to an end but I am sure Jamie Dornan is quite busy now.,1496361600,,400,3.4719101123595504
8755823,1,B01DF3U6PW,"I watched all 3 series on Prime.

Series 1 and 2 were quite good and held my interest although the subject matter is dark

Series 3 takes up where series 2 ends.

There is a lot of time on screen that seems intended to slowly build an emotional connection.

Some may enjoy that style but I felt the story dragged on and on.

Having watched it I would suggest instead fast forward and watch only parts of the first episode(s) of series three and then perhaps watch the final episode.",1496188800,3,482,4.311111111111111
8755824,5,B01DF3U6PW,Wow what an ending.,1495065600,2,19,4.0
8755825,4,B01DF3U6PW,the first two seasons were intense and exciting. they should have ended it there.,1493942400,2,81,4.857142857142857
8755826,1,B01DF3U6PW,The Fall series 3 DVD that I received about 10 days ago would not play. It said that it was unable to play in this region. I am still waiting for the correct DVD to arrive.,1493251200,7,172,3.8055555555555554
