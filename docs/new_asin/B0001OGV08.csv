2021424,1,B0001OGV08,"This flick is soooo bad that:
--the sex is boring;
--the acting reminds one of that first-grade play we all had to endure;
--the actors act like they don't care;
--the plot is nonsense;
--even the kinky stuff -- one drawn-out sex scene spliced with girl-on-girl s&m -- rates a yawn.
Advice: Don't waste your money on this dribble.",1082764800,4,330,4.610169491525424
8015473,3,B0001OGV08,I did not see anywhere that this was edited. I had seen the movie before and noticed that some scenes were shorter. Was not happy about this and that's why I cannot give it higher rating.,1483315200,,187,4.222222222222222

8015477,1,B0001OGV08,"Never received the item from the seller (Woody's Books).  E-mail correspondence with the seller was extremely aggravating as instead of addressing my concerns I would get ""canned"" responses.  Almost as though someone picked a word out of my e-mail, determined it fit a specific response and cut and pasted the response from a FAQ list.",1257120000,,335,5.072727272727272
8015478,2,B0001OGV08,"There's quite a number of vampire stripper films already out there; Blond Heaven, Vamps, Vamps 2 etc.

This one follows the same formula. It's not any worse, but it does have some really stupid moments in it, especially the ending.

Take for instance a vampire stripper goes out to a guys van to have sex with him and to feed. They're in the back of the van when she bits him he throws her off, jumps to the front of the van and begins to drive off. Why? She's still in the back of the van. You can't drive away from someone in the same vehicle!

Why's an immortal vampire running a very small strip-joint, anyway? He should have heaps of money; having made a killing in long-term investments.",1181433600,,693,4.3565891472868215

Do not spend a dime on this garbage.  Action = 0, Plot = 1, Gore = 0

8015481,4,B0001OGV08,"In defense of this film, yes it is truly bad. The plot hilarious, the acting bad, and the ending is truly horrific (not in a good way).  BUT it has Evan Stone (the Adult Film Star) and he is truly mesmerizing to watch.  He is the only reason this film is watchable at all and you can see why his career has taken off so well. If only you could see his great scene! This DVD is NOT the movie they show on TV. It has been CUT. All the remotely sexy parts have been cut out, and it ends up being just a little over an hour. Catch it on Late Night, it's much better.",1103241600,18,562,3.836206896551724
