4492207,5,B004X63RMA,"Whoa, teen rebellion on steroids plus African-American family conflicts in an Anglo-American neighborhood during late 1950's, early 1960's, America.  Memories of injustices past and present clash with the expectations of participation in the present (1960's) American lifestyle amid backward peceptions reinforced by choice.

A young black teen comes home angry from school after storming out of class at the teacher's remarks--plus a few words, because the teacher reinforced to the students (White Anglo Saxon Protestant) the idea that the slaves were too lazy to free themselves.  Grandma tries to convince the young man that he should not have behaved that way. After he tells her what else has been happening she understands his position. The young man thinks that he needs to get away to get his head together as to which direction to take his life. He takes a few of his things and grandma gives him a couple of bucks (late '50's, early '60's money) and he leaves his suburban home making sure his parents, who were arriving home, didn't see him leave.

The young man walks around for awhile, goes into a bar and meets a slightly sordid group of people some of whom listen to his complaints and questions. His naivete(sp) often shows.  There is amusement, inquitiveness, and a touch of intrigue with the young man. After a couple of adverse encounters the young man goes back home to face his parents.  Here, during an argument with his parents and afterward, is where the memories of racism hit face-to-face with the belief that a better life can be attained and the actions associated with that attainment.

A side note, I especially got a kick out of grandma and seeing the celebrities in their younger days. I didn't expect to see a young Ruby Dee and a real young Johnny (I Can See Clearly Now (song)) Nash. This movie brought back a memory of James Dean. I did not know this movie existed and I don't remember ever seeing it on tv! It is worth it's price for the rarity of the subject in media alone.

Thank you for reading what I think is my gift.",1342828800,18,2061,4.721448467966574
