8045936,5,B00078GLT4,"This movie had me rolling on the floor laughing more than once.
The scene where Polygraph Polygraphovich improvises a little tune on his balalaika in full view of the Doctor and assembled notables is to my mind one of the most hilarious scenes in the history of cinema. Goes the distance with the great movies of the Marx Brothers.
Which is very high praise in my book.",1455494400,3,369,4.522388059701493
8045937,5,B00078GLT4,"An excellent rendition of Bulgakov's novel! Whether you prefer to watch a movie at face value or one that's ripe with symbolism, this is an absolutely worthwhile purchase.

One criticism: It may have just been the copy that I purchased, but the English subtitles had obvious quirks: for example, if the dialogue started with an ""s"", that ""s"" was omitted, which was a bit jarring. Again, maybe I was sold a subpar copy. Regardless, it's one of my favorite films (and novellas).",1388793600,3,476,4.804878048780488
8045938,5,B00078GLT4,"Besides being a cutting analysis of the collectivist mindset, this film is FUNNY! I never came so close to laughing to death as when...",1385596800,,135,4.666666666666667
8045939,5,B00078GLT4,"The novella from which the film version of Heart of a Dog is by Mikhail Bulgakov, one of Russia's most important writers of the 20th century and is itself done masterfully. Nearly all of the dialog is directly from the novella and captures both Bulgakov's subtlety and his very punchy criticism of and satire on the early Soviet regime and its loopy ideology and practices. Furthermore, many of the issues remain relevant to our own times and probably all times--in particular the notion that human beings can be manipulated into being perfect.",1378598400,5,544,4.923913043478261
8045940,5,B00078GLT4,This is without a doubt one of the best soviet era movies based on the book. It is hilarious if you understand Russian.,1217289600,7,119,4.217391304347826
