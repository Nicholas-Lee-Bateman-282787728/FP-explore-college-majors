Note: Encoded for playback in the US. This was not obvious from the product's description.",1418688000,3,293,4.327272727272727

4259022,5,B00441GYYM,"This boxset was my first experience with Jet Li's older movies. For the most part, I had only seen him in the small bad guy roles in movies like ""Lethal Weapon."" I wanted to get to know more of his movies where he was lead actor and what had made him famous. This was a very good start. The boxset is a very good set I must say. You get to see life portrayed in distant but not ancient China. And you get to see Jet Li portray the life of Wong Fei Hong. It was funny watching ""Ip man 2, where a man mentions that the kung fu teachers he is fighting are not ""Wong Fei Hong."" It is a good story. Good set of movies. Wong Fei Hong has his students, who have lives as vendors on the street when they are not practicing. Some of the antics are pretty funny. But everyone comes together to defend each other and, later, Chinese women who are being shipped off to America for Prostitution. So the movies have historical accuracy as well. It shows people who are dedicated to certain ideals and the practice of Kung fu. I wish I could have the life and dedication that his students have with him as a teacher. Life, kung fu, and each other. The 4th movie, ""Once upon a time in China and America"", has Fei Hong traveling to America to see a student that set up a store in America for the Chinese there. They meet a strange, lost American gunfighter that they befriend and who helps them fight back when the sheriff in the town says the Chinese stole some money. It is a set up of course. But everything turns out alright in the end.
It is a great set of movies that I thoroughly enjoyed. The shipping estimate said around a month or so to get them. But they arrived within 15 days (have to check exactly) way sooner than was stated. They were professionally wrapped and protected, so the box is in new condition.",1404086400,4,1803,4.198847262247838

8415584,1,B00441GYYM,"I own a lot of Kung Fu movies. Many of them are bootleg transfers to DVD from old, rotten VHS tapes. This copy of Once Upon a Time in China is probably the second-worse Kung Fu movie transfer I have ever seen. It has terrible (really, truly terrible) video quality. It looks like it was copied using a Telex machine, melted crayons and a waffle iron. The resolution is so low, I can't tell if it's pixellated or out of focus or a Jackson Pollack painting. I couldn't look at the screen for too long as I started to get a headache. Unwatchable. Judging from the other reviews, it seems I got slipped a bootleg by Amazon. Buy at your own risk.",1497916800,4,641,4.262295081967213

8415588,5,B00441GYYM,Jet Li is really in a class of his own in the martial arts genre. Tsui Hark manages to combine amazing martial arts sequences with balletic grace and incredible power and speed with humour as well.

8415590,5,B00441GYYM,"OUTIC is a cinematic masterpiece. The real stars of the film are Writer/Director Tsui Hark & Cinematographer Arthur Wong.
Every shot is lovingly intentional.
The story is melancholy meta-story, with Hong Kong returning to China, the audience identified with the cultural uncertainty of westernization possibly rendering Chinese ways obsolete.
Juxtaposing stark realism with martial arts fantasy Wong Fei Hong laments to growing presence of western guns but finds himself facing an opponent that can only be beaten by a gun.",1439251200,,523,5.55
