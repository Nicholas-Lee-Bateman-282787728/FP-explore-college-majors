7943241,5,B00005KH29,"I have seen several documentaries that have tried to explain just what film noir is, and for the most part I was disappointed.  Then I found this dvd.  With no narration to sway me one way or the other, these tiny little gems are the perfect way to be introduced to the genre.  They don't give away all of the plot, but they definitely make me want to see the films.  They are also a very sad commentary on today's film industry:  these coming attractions are far more entertaining than just about anything you can find in theatres today.  Don't miss this one, and then do what I did - try to find all of the films and enjoy them as well.  Time very well spent.",1158883200,17,661,4.198412698412699
7943242,5,B00005KH29,"If you want to see real trailers, from an age where the studios did not spill the beans on every detail of the plot, ""Pulp Cinema"" will satisfy your longing for the Golden Era of Cinema.
After being  entertained for over an hour, I felt like I had been transported in a time machine ""to a world""  where filmmakers understood the point of a trailer: to entertain on it's own and provoke one into seeing a great film.
If  movies were dreams then these trailers were their bedtime stories; entertaining and exciting in thier own right, without giving away what lay ahead in the dark over the next hours.
This was an era when trailers were created as entertainment that captured the sense of the film without giving away the whole story.
These trailers are entertainment in themselves, and I am thankful they have been preserved in this glorious set, on a medium that is helping to save and bring these classic cinema gems of unadulterated entertainment to a new generation.
Trailers  from the 1930s,'40s and '50s include:  ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Big Sleep,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""The Killing,"" ""Key Largo,""  amongst others.  Future filmakers should take note: This is how trailers should be!",997056000,52,1239,4.899521531100478
