6437221,5,B00KOW4AL4,"Absolutely love the ""Lovejoy"" series. Can't get enough. Hope to see more seasons added.",1410739200,,87,5.285714285714286
6437222,5,B00KOW4AL4,"Series 2 of Lovejoy has some of my favorite episodes as well as favorite moments in episodes.  It is so wonderful to have this set and to see again the outwitting of the snobby brother and sister-in-law who won't share the inheritance with the artistic brother, or the whole crew trying not to be a bit shaken by the ""curse"" attached to a South American golden artifact.  There are disclaimers with this set that the age of the series has resulted in some color or sound recording discrepancies.  If there are, I was so involved in each episode, this did not register with me, therefore the enjoyment was complete.  If you own series 1, you will want to add series 2 to your collection, and here's to more to come from Acorn!!",1410393600,,726,4.4772727272727275
6437223,5,B00KOW4AL4,"So glad to enjoy the continued adventures! Lovejoy and his merry band--Tink, Eric and Lady Jane--return to unravel more fascinating forays into the world of antiques (real gems or faux treasures!). This series ran on A&E in the 90s and remains fresh and likable today, despite the technologically crazy world we live in. You won't catch Lovejoy texting someone or updating his Facebook status--this is timeless entertainment with the perfectly cast Ian McShane inviting us along for the journey. As always with Acorn, the production values are superior and the content means you'll always have an absorbing story to follow. Bring on the rest of the Lovejoy series!",1408320000,,664,5.157407407407407
6437224,5,B00KOW4AL4,"Lovejoy ran 6 season (1986 to early 90s). This 1991, Series 2, even better than One. Nostalgic Brit drama based on antiques, not traditional crime. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a likable rogue dealer of antiquities. Hes a divvy (aka gifted spotter of antique value) sometimes bordering on unlawful, con, and charmed sleuth. I love shopping antiques, thus this series is a treasure. LOOSELY based on Jonathan Gash novels. Almost 11 hours total viewing.
Regular cast includes Tink (Dudley Sutton Beiderbecke trilogy) a divvy who drinks too much; Eric Catchpole (Chris Jury) youth on apprenticeship of sorts; Lady Jane Felsham (Phyllis Logan a young Mrs Downton Abbey Hughes) a married rich decorator and antique crony and Lovejoys new cottage landlord. Lovejoy's adopted car is named Miriam. Plus guest stars of the 90s to today.

6437246,5,B00KOW4AL4,"Love Lovejoy! Antiques, mystery, comedy, romance and a great cast of characters! Lovejoy is a divvy - he can tell a fake from a real by the way it hums to him. He is not a perfect man and not above a con against a con artist. So there is danger involved, too. Tinker is his right hand man, also has a problem with alcohol. Eric is his apprentice and is a bit clumsy and always making mistakes. Lady Jane is his partner in the antiques business and adds a flair of sophistication, but she has a big heart. Her husband is a businessman and on the bench. Lovely English countryside. This series dated in the late 80's and early 90's, but could happen today. I highly recommend Lovejoy!",1466380800,,682,4.294573643410852

6437263,5,B00KOW4AL4,"I am a new fan to this wonderful series and find myself wondering if I was born in the wrong country! I enjoy many British productions and Lovejoy was a recent recommendation. The first series is a lovely introduction to unique and memorable characters who charmed me from the beginning and continue into the second series, though you can see subtle changes in the character's personalities and appearances, as several years passed between the two series. The quality of the supporting actors is improved and you will recognize younger versions of several very well known actors, but I must say the first series had something special, a certain whimsy, that the second series seems to have misplaced. I recently purchased the third series and am looking forward to more hours of pleasure in the company of these engaging characters.",1444348800,,832,4.9928057553956835
6437264,5,B00KOW4AL4,"A fun series starring Ian McShane. Yes, it is remake of Sherlock Holmes (ala ""House"") but in the English antiques trade. Dudley Sutton plays his Watson (""Tinker""). The series is smart and funny and well worth watching in my view. It lasted on TV in the UK from 1986-1994, so that speaks well of it. Later it aired on A & E in the US before that network became a freak show.

Most people will probably know McShane from ""Deadwood"" where he played the heroic villain Al Swearengen.",1444176000,,479,4.443181818181818
