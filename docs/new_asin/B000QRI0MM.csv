8532455,4,B000QRI0MM,"This product is in the Flemish/Dutch language.  It is a collection of short stories told by an elder gnome about life with his gnome friends.  The actors are middle aged Europeans dressed in fat suits with two pointed and spring loaded gnome hats.

The collection is named after one of the first stories, ""De Mutspunt Ziekte"".  Loosely translated, this seems to means that the hat arm is stuck up in the air.  I would say that this is full of toddler humor, most of which needs no translation.

If you don't speak the language but don't mind that the actors are not speaking your native tongue, this might work for your kids.  Dutch seems to sound close to both English and German.  In this DVD, the actors typically talk slowly and accentuate so that a baby or toddler who is still learning to talk could still potentially understand the main points.  The content seems to be appropriate for young children.",1286755200,,908,4.625
