""LATEST AND IMPORTANT NEWS ABOUT THE RELASE OF NASCHY'S WEREWOLF BY ONE7MOVIES. I have just received this from Carlos Aparicio: Hi, I can confirm it is an illegal release. The copyright of this film is owned by Victory Films S.A., and in no time we have negotiated the assignment of the rights to the sale of this film on DVD with this company.""",1418688000,3,377,4.544117647058823
8579208,5,B00CAEK7FW,"This is undoubtedly one of Paul Naschy's obscure films, and that's unfortunate for it is magnificent to watch, feel, take in,etc. I still don't understand this phenomena that occurs when I watch this movie, as with most of Naschy's films, but it is almost magical. Maybe this is just for me but if so I'm not complaining or knocking it! I just hope,wish others are able to experience it also. Not for everyone but neither is sour cream. A great 70's retro-spanish horror flik..",1376611200,2,477,4.690476190476191
8579209,2,B00CAEK7FW,"The quality of this DVD-R is not at all worth the current 14.99 price tag.  First of all, my blu ray player (which has never had an issue playing DVD-Rs in the past) refused to play this disc.  Luckily, my Xbox 360 was more agreeable.  However, the feature is riddled with instances where the frame freezes awkwardly for a split second.  It's a little distracting, but not utterly unwatchable.  Aside from that, the transfer looks pretty good to me.  I give two stars for providing a digital version of a Paul Naschy classic not available anywhere else in the states.  I would be willing to increase to four stars if the bugs were worked out or if the price was lowered to 4.99.

This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon.  I felt compelled to let people know exactly what they were receiving for the price.  Had I known, I certainly wouldn't have spent that much money.",1375574400,,881,4.484276729559748
8579210,1,B00CAEK7FW,A full 6 minutes was cut from this movie for this new DVD. This DVD ran 82 minutes. The full movie is 88 minutes This was some butcher job. Better off getting the VHS Video tape which contains the entire movie. I hate it when they do this. Do not buy.,1369353600,5,251,3.9411764705882355
8579211,4,B00CAEK7FW,"I have been awaiting the release of this title for 15 years. The film was originally entitled ""La Maldicion de La Bestia"" (the same title the DVD actually displays in the opening moments of the film) but those who put out the DVD call it ""The Werewolf and the Yeti""  One of the better of Naschy's werewolf flicks from the 1970's. To those who have access to putting out obscure Paul Naschy Spanish horror films I would say this: How about releasing the following three titles sometime in the near future (even bootleg copies are better than no copies at all): :La Venganza de Momia"" aka ""The Mummy's Revenge"" (1973); ""La Bestia Y La Espada Magica"" aka ""The Beast and the Magic Sword"" (1983)-this, a Hispano/Japanese co-production-; and "" El Aullida del Diablo"" aka ""Howl of the Devil"" (1988). Maybe this can be done sometime over the next year or two! Let's hope so.",1368576000,3,866,4.623376623376624
