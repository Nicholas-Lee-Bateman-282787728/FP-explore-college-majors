963622,5,6305080259,"A beautifully restored black and white classic film by DigicomTv. Excellent audio and video quality. A must see for the entire family!

The story begins with a prominent surgeon in 1840's England who is determined to perform painless operations by finding a way to anesthetize his patients while performing amputations. Boris Karloff gives an extraordinary performance as Doctor Bolton, and is a kind, compassionate doctor who treats hospital patients as well as the poor and indigent.

Dr. Bolton continues his search for the exact formula to produce an effective anesthetic, experimenting on himself. Eventually, the doctor becomes addicted to his own inhalation of chemicals used to produce the anesthesia, and begins to lose his credibility and expertise as an eminent London surgeon. He eventually finds himself in a crime-ridden and disreputable area of London known as 'Seven Dials', where people are purposely being murdered so that their bodies can be sold to the hospital for money. Dr. Bolton soon resorts to these thieves and cut-throats to provide him with the chemicals he needs to continue his anesthesia experiments by writing fraudulent death certificates for those who are being murdered in 'Seven Dials'.

Needless to say, poor Doctor Bolton is in a downward spiral of addiction, and the necessity to procure the drugs he needs to continue his experimentation. It is clear what sort of demise Doctor Bolton will arrive at if he continues down this desperate path, but watch the ending to see how things may actually come right in the end.

A really great story which leaves you guessing as to how anything good can come of this tortured Doctor and his well intentioned experiments to make human operations painless. There is tragedy mixed with hope in this film, and it is certainly well worth the viewing. Boris Karloff is at his best in this role, and exhibits a wonderful and convincing performance throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think you will, too!!!!",1381363200,,1995,5.110429447852761

963630,5,6305080259,"I bought this four movie compilation in order to get ""The First Man Into Space"", a movie I saw when I was a kid, back in 1959. At the time it scared the bejeepers out of me. The other three movies, ""Atomic Submarine"", ""The Haunted Strangler"" and ""Corridors of Blood"" were pretty much icing on the cake, so to speak. Particularly the last two since they're both Boris Karloff movies. I mean, who doesn't like Karloff?

So far, I've watched the First Man Into Space, not quite as scary now as it was when I was 12, but still a pretty good movie, even after all these years. And I've watched Atomic Submarine, also a fair movie for it's day (1959), but as a 14 year Navy vet, let me tell you there were so many inaccuracies in that movie I had to laugh at a lot of it.

But, if you're a fan of science fiction/horror movies, I would definitely reccomend this set, especially since the only way I could find The First Man Into Space as a single was in a European format, not compatable with the US.",1353715200,,994,4.226315789473684

963712,5,6305080259,"A beautifully restored black and white classic film by Remember When Classic Movies. Excellent audio and video quality. A must see for the entire family!

Boris Karloff is brilliant in this film  a cult classic! As a doctor, Karloff is trying to find a way to produce an anesthetic so that the patients he operates on will feel no pain during surgery. Instead, this film takes a dark path down a slippery slope when Dr. Bolton (Boris Karloff) begins to succumb to his own anesthetic addiction. He soon finds himself involved with criminals and cut-throats to acquire the drugs he desperately craves.

Needless to say, poor Doctor Bolton is in a downward spiral of addiction, and the necessity to procure the drugs he needs to continue his experimentation. It is clear what sort of demise Doctor Bolton will arrive at if he continues down this desperate path, but watch the ending to see how things may actually come right in the end.

963715,5,6305080259,"Great respect for Boris Karloff making a movie about drug addiction back in the day when it really was not discussed. It's a scary movie first, but I felt the drug addiction aspect was more the more important theme. It's very sad because Karloff plays this doctor who is a surgeon in the days when there was no anesthesia at all. So the only mercy a surgeon could show was his speed in cutting off or out whatever needed excising. Karloff tries his best to crest a gas that will knock people out during amputations and whatnot. Unfortunately he experiments on himself after a humiliating mishap in the operating theatre right in front of the best doctors around...and he gets addicted to his product. Then comes the downward spiral. But I found this movie extra moving because Boris Karloff was friends with Bela Lugosi who was a morphine addict. Doctors had prescribed it to Mr. Lugosi for pain from a old war wound so he could keep working. But when it was discovered he'd become an addict he was not allowed to work anymore. That's Hollywood for ya.",1468800000,,1052,4.601063829787234
963786,4,6305080259,"streaming great. film wonderful. very camp. what special effects they actually used were poor by todays standards (more like something a HS student today would be able to create), but probably very good in the day. The story was the same - outer-space alien coming to scout and send back word for master race to take over our world scenario but the monster/cyclops/squidy octopus idea who communicates via telepathy was GREAT! It was very threatening in appearance and in its manner. There were marked similarities between the storyline in this  movie and in Independence Day. I first saw this as an early teen and loved it so I looked for it to buy. I'm still trying to find all the Sci-Fi B movies to re-watch and was very happy to shell out the money for this one. If anyone has compiled a list of the old Sci-Fi movies from the 50s and 60s, I'd love to see it. There are some I can only recall glimpses of and have No idea who was in them, their title, etc, but if I start with titles, I could review them (assuming I could find them to watch).

Both ATOMIC SUBMARINE and CORRIDORS OF BLOOD are reviewed below, though they are shown separately. THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE has Arthur Franz and crew, in the vehicle of the title, searching for a mysterious USO (Yep, an underwater flying saucer!). This leads to adventure and the eventual boarding of the strange craft. The highlight comes when the humans encounter the hideous, tentacled cyclops inside! CORRIDORS OF BLOOD has Boris Karloff as a kindly surgeon, trying to find a less painful / traumatic way to perform amputations. Alas, his good intentions aren't enough, and are ultimately counteracted by his own addiction, as well as the highly unscrupulous people w/ whom he must deal. This leads to murder and despair. Karloff is, as always, brilliant at playing his ""nice-man-turns-to-the-dark-side"" role. Watch for an early, captivating role for Christopher Lee (HORROR HOTEL. HAMMER'S DRACULA FILMS, THE WICKER MAN), as the perfectly malevolent ""Resurrection Joe"".  He's one frightening guy! Highly recommended...",1444348800,,1128,5.445714285714286

Cool subplot of body snatching ring to sell corpses to medical schools, with Christopher Lee chilling as the most murderous among them, and another Hammer alum Yvonne Romain as the woman who lures unsuspecting victims into his clutches.

The story begins with a prominent surgeon in 1840's England who is determined to perform painless operations by finding a way to anesthetize his patients while performing amputations. Boris Karloff gives an extraordinary performance as Doctor Bolton, and is a kind, compassionate doctor who treats hospital patients as well as the poor and indigent.

Dr. Bolton continues his search for the exact formula to produce an effective anesthetic, experimenting on himself. Eventually, the doctor becomes addicted to his own inhalation of chemicals used to produce the anesthesia, and begins to lose his credibility and expertise as an eminent London surgeon. He eventually finds himself in a crime-ridden and disreputable area of London known as 'Seven Dials', where people are purposely being murdered so that their bodies can be sold to the hospital for money. Dr. Bolton soon resorts to these thieves and cut-throats to provide him with the chemicals he needs to continue his anesthesia experiments by writing fraudulent death certificates for those who are being murdered in 'Seven Dials'.
