5094186,5,B007L0U1R4,"This is in response to a misleading earlier review from a person who was apparently upset that this set was released only on DVD and not Blu-ray. The reviewer inferred that it was a ""fuzzy DVD"" when in fact, it is a wonderful set made from outstanding source material with sharp picture quality and beautiful, vibrant colors. These great cartoons are a joy to watch, and I for one am very happy that they have been released on DVD!",1333756800,33,431,4.468354430379747
5094187,5,B007L0U1R4,"Being a big fan of John Hubley and of ""cartoon modern"" style in general, I had to order this set in advance.  It's beautiful, and I'm sure that there are better reviewers more versed in animation history who can give this remarkable set a more thoughtful analysis.  Here's what I can tell you:

It's NOT a DVD-R set.  This is a factory-pressed set in a four-fold cardboard sleeve with a great booklet.  Everything about the presentation is attractive to the eye, and fitting to the style of UPA.

Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck provide insight and commentary on several shorts.  Their work here is certainly in keeping with the Walt Disney Treasures, Looney Tunes and other vintage collections.  This set is ready to fit right on your shelf to take it's rightful place in the history of U.S. animation on DVD.

There are 38 cartoons, and they are gloriously restored.  I've never seen many of them, but it feels as though I'm seeing them all as the creators did when they were first wrapped, printed and screened. Bright colors, clear lines, no blurring -- excellent!

Don't let the early reviews posted here fool you; this is a five-star release and everyone who made it happen deserves credit, a thank you, and much success.  Enjoy!",1333152000,41,1233,4.710280373831775

5094191,4,B007L0U1R4,"There is a book called WHEN MAGOO FLEW: The Rise and Fall of Animation Studio UPA (by Adam Abraham -- also CONVENIENTLY available here at Amazon!) which is a marvelous history of UPA and its crazy motley of Anti-Disney-ite animators, writers, producers, directors, and storyboarders (if that's a word).  But it, like this DVD, is FAR more than just Magoo-centric.  After reading the book, I was aware that I'd not really paid attention to the stylistic brilliance of the cartoons (Magoo and others) when I was a kid.  And I'm old enough to remember many of these 7-minute gems in movie houses! To have an opportunity to once again SEE the product resulting from the trials and tribulations behind-the-scenes of this Little-Studio-Engine-That-Could, and to connect the cartoons with the devilishly complicated politics, policies, and commitment which sparked such inventiveness was a GREAT experience.  I wasn't aware of how many contemporary ""real"" artists of the period held the UPA work in such high esteem, for example. Or that there were a great number of political cartoons involved.  Dated? Of course. Silly? Wonderfully. Sly and provocative? Surprisingly so.  If you are a movie-going cartoon lover, this collection is a real treat, particularly combined with Mr. Abraham's tasty treatise.",1378771200,3,1296,5.266990291262136
5094192,5,B007L0U1R4,I purchased this for a friend and he was thrilled beyond belief when he viewed the DVDs. He couldn't be happier to get these on a set of DVDs.,1360627200,,142,3.9310344827586206
5094193,5,B007L0U1R4,"Cartoon lovers will rejoice to find this set of the little-seen UPA theatrical shorts. They were previously released on VHS as Columbia cartoons, as were the UPA Mr. Magoo titles, but this is the first DVD collection. A few of these shorts used to even be shown on projectors in schools, notably ""The Unicorn in the Garden"" by Thurber, and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" based on the story by Poe. The reason they were shown, however, was because of the bold, minimalist, modern look UPA began giving its cartoons from the late 'forties"" 'till the late 'fifties. They also tried to make every short look different, and for a while, to have different characters. This didn't really work, so there were repeat characters, especially Mr. Magoo, who, after winning an Academy Award, became a runaway favorite.

Seen now, some of the stories fall a little flat, some of the characters are not the best, and some of the designs seem rather unfinished. That said, imagine them on the big screen, or if you can, watch them that way. Imagine them for what they were meant to be, the cartoon accompanying a movie that plays at the corner cinema and then is gone. Imagine them before the days of VHS recorders, and you'll see why people wanted to see them again. Since they were one-offs, not series with recurring characters, audiences didn't know what to expect, and the UPA logo at the beginning of a reel was almost like a character itself, leading to a surprise cartoon. This was the opposite tactic of the other studios, like Disney and Warner Bros, which played on success of a popular character. The early UPA title sequence is itself a work of art.

This set includes 38 ""Jolly Frolics"" theatrical shorts on three DVD discs in a tri-fold slipcase, with a fourteen page booklet. The booklet suggests three books for further reading. They are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Magoo-Flew-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Animation-Studio-UPA/dp/0819569143/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Magoo Flew: The Rise and Fall of Animation Studio UPA</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Mice-and-Magic-A-History-of-American-Animated-Cartoons-Revised-and-Updated-Plume-Books/dp/0452259932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons; Revised and Updated (Plume Books)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Modern-Style-and-Design-in-1950s-Animation/dp/0811847314/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Modern: Style and Design in 1950s Animation</a>. Why? Because Adam Abraham, author of the first book wrote the two page intro to this set; Leonard Maltin, who wrote the second book provides commentary on six cartoon shorts. Jerry Beck, who helped research that book, also put this set together and provides commentary. The third book, Cartoon Modern, is a dazzling coffee table book about the modern era of '50s cartoons UPA helped launch.

Because these cartoon shorts are so individual, viewers will have their favorites. One always mentioned in cartoon books is the original Gerald McBoing Boing short by Dr. Seuss, and here is also the ""Madeline"" cartoon by Ludwig Bemelmens. But I was knocked out by the backgrounds on ""The Wonder Gloves"" and the loose design aesthetic on ""Fudget's Budget"", to name two lesser-known shorts. The only Mr. Magoo short included here is the first one, ""The Ragtime Bear"", from 1949, which won an Academy Award. But that's because of the forthcoming Mr. Magoo theatrical cartoon set, which is a companion to this collection. This set is branded ""Turner Classic Movies Vault Collection"", and like TCM, it's a class act which, along with Abraham's book, will help to restore UPA to its rightful place in animation history",1346284800,6,3799,5.768270944741533
5094194,4,B007L0U1R4,"This Amazon purchase is well worth the cost to me. The prints in this collection look very new and very accurate. better than half of this collection I had never seen before. Some of these films exhibit stories not as compelling and involving and animation not as inventive as the studio's very best stuff. Fresh design Ideas seem always to be present. Some of the backgrounds in the film "" Bringing Up Mother "" are beautiful design short hand for very specific locations at specific times of the day. Wonderful stuff.

Why not 5 stars?  It's because of what's not there.  There are more theatrical shorts, commercials and educationals that are needed to complete the UPA archive. These may not be at the distributor's disposal or even their awareness.  They are the rest of the story and I want to see them",1342051200,4,807,4.661971830985915
5094195,5,B007L0U1R4,"There are four reasons to buy this unique collection of animated gems - either for yourself or someone who loves movies:

Item 1:  ""The Tell-Tale Heart"".  Far and away the best of the bunch, James Mason narrates this  animated film which is illustrated by surrealistic art. In the story, an insane man  murders his landlord solely because he thinks the fellow possesses an evil eye.  James Mason owns this story - chilly, unsettling, and visually arresting. (For older children...only please). This is one of those animated films that I can see over and over and never get tired of it.

Item 2:  ""The Unicorn in the Garden"".  This is the story by James Thurber and it never fails to delight. The visuals are based on his satirical cartoon style.

Item 3:  ""Madeleine"".  Yes, this is the sweet story of the little girl from a French convent. The cartoon preserves the marvelous color backgrounds of Paris as an artistic palette to the story. Beautifully done.

Item 4:  ""Rooty Toot Toot"" - now here love gets out of hand as the story of Frankie and Johnnie is given a jazzy sendoff.  Think of the musical ""Chicago"" and you get an idea.

There is a lot of visual inventiveness in this set...and some of these cartoons have only been available in a hard to find VHS copy - Columbia Pictures Cartoon Classics Vol 9 ....until now.  So, for an unexpected visual feast, don't miss this set of animation treasures.  If this  item strikes your fancy, you may want to add to your collection ""Betty Boop 23 Classic Cartoons"" which includes some masterpieces like Betty Boop's Snow White with Cab Calloway voicing Koko the Klown singing the blues.",1340496000,,1635,4.693661971830986
5094196,5,B007L0U1R4,"This is the BEST the UPA Cartoons have ever looked!
525p DVD resolution, while not 1080p Blu-ray resolution, still looks great.  Many HD-TVs have only 720p resolution which is only a little higher than the 525p resolution of DVDs.
Some non-Cinemascope titles have been letterboxed to look 1:85-1 widescreen, while they may not have been filmed this way, they were certainly composed for this widescreen format and look fine.

For those not familiar with UPA cartoons they are a visual treat for the eye. Not in the Disney way, these are very stylish like watching a painting come to life.
Don't expect the hilarity of a Looney Tunes cartoon, that was not UPS's style. You will laugh, but you will also be stunned by the graphic design stylings.
Starting with 1952's THE OOMPAS, UPA was in top form with no misses outside of the Family Circus and Ham & Hattie series.
This is not to say that there are no gems before this, there are. GERALD McBOING BOING (1951) is probably their first big stand out cartoon. UPA was visually well ahead of the other studios in the 1950's, even Disney would imitate them.

I admit that I am not a fan of either The Family Circus or the Ham & Hattie series. By 1958 it seemed that UPA had run out of steam after 10 years of cartoons, some of the creative team had left by then. But the rest are visual gems.",1337644800,23,3093,4.789868667917449

8519224,3,B007L0U1R4,"The technical quality of the UPA Jolly Frolics Collection of cartoons is great, although I don't see the vibrant colors of the Disney or Looney Tunes of the period. This is mostly due to a different style of animation, probably, but these don't seem to be fully restored. A few scenes here and there within the cartoons are blurred---very few, though. And despite the buildup of these UPA cartoons and their animators in the introduction by Leonard Maltin, the plotlines and characters are just ho-hum for the most part. The artwork is interesting simply because it is different from the major studios' artwork at the time, and I can certainly see the influence this style had on Jay Ward and the later Rocky & Bullwinkle animators. Only two of these cartoons really stood out to me, The Tell-Tale Heart (which is now on the National Film Registry) and Madeline, which is based on the classic children's book. I love classic short cartoons, but was overall disappointed with these from UPA.",1513468800,,990,4.829411764705882
