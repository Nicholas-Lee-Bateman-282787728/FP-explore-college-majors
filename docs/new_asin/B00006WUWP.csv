1794983,5,B00006WUWP,"Review of Austin Powers in Goldmember
Hot Toasty Rag, November 23, 2017

Mike Myers is back for a third installment of his hilarious spy spoof franchise in Austin Powers in Goldmember. He continues to wow and amuse audiences with his multiple roles, playing Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember, the new villain in the film. Youll see some familiar faces, Michael York, Seth Green, Robert Wagner, Mindy Serling, and Verne Troyer, but in this third moviewhich doesnt necessarily have to be watched in order, but it does helpyoull most likely roar with laughter because of the new faces added to the cast.

Firstly, and lets face it, most importantly, Michael Caine is in the movie. Since Mike Myers had previously revealed part of the inspiration behind his Austin Powers movies was Michael Caines Harry Palmer character, its pretty adorable and fitting that Michael Caine was recruited to play Austin Powerss father! And, as a very sweet touch, since Myerss glasses were made to be a replica of Caines, Caine found his original frames from the 1960s and wore them for the film! Michael Caine is everything youd expect Austin Powerss dad to be, and pretty much everything out of his mouth is completely hilarious. Im sure youll gain some household phrases from this movie, whether its If you have an issue, heres a tissue or There are two things in this world I hate: people who are intolerant of other peoples cultures, and the Dutch or his joke about Viagra.

Next up is the hysterical opening to the film: At first you think you're just watching Austin Powers in a car chase sequence, but he gets out of the car and its actually Tom Cruise! Turns out, Steven Spielberg is making a movie about Austin Powers, starring Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and John Travolta. Add in cameos by Britney Spears, Quincy Jones, Katie Couric, the Osbourne family, Burt Bacharach, Rob Lowe, Clint Howard, and Nathan Lanein one of the funniest gags of the movieand youll be on your toes for the entire film, wondering whos going to pop up next.

Beyonc makes her film debut in the movie, and while its painfully clear she has zero acting ability, if youd like you can cut her a little slack since she was only twenty years old. Still, her lack of confidence and talent in front of the camera doesnt really detract from the rest of the film. Its extremely funny, and full of phrases youll find yourself repeating for decades to come.",1511395200,,2459,4.751756440281031

1795139,2,B00006WUWP,"I am a fan of the original Austin Powers.  It was fun, fresh and, although it had scatological stupidity in it, I was able to forgive the lapse in judgement because of the freshness of the other comic bits and how well the story played out in it's parody of the spy film genre.
Goldmember has little of the originals charm, has far too much toilet humor for most anyones taste, and the title character is so underdeveloped as to be completley unmemorable.  Mike Myers is still funny and mostly charming, but gone are the touches that make AP human and engaging beyond the sophomoric.  Beyonce as Foxy Brown does a great job in her character and is enjoyable, but her writing and development is stunted as well.  The Movie within the movie with Tom Cruise and several A-listers is well done, but it never pays off like it could.  There are still a few funny scenes and Scotty finally recieves the respect he deserves from his father, with a twist, which sets up the the franchise for a sequel however, it is easy to see why it did not happen.  This movie seems hastily put together as far a concept and writing.  It seems like they started with some great ideas and thought that the rest would be filled in ""when the magic of the AP franchise began kicking in""Unfortunately that moment never came.  Too bad for fans of Austin Powers and Mike Myers.  If MM ever returns to comedy filmmaking, I hope he can keep the caca to a minimum and learns to lean more on a blend of the sincere,ernest comedy he does so well.",1439337600,,1511,4.406474820143885

1795156,1,B00006WUWP,Ridiculous piece of trash. I couldn't take more than 20 mins. of this kind of humor. It's a shame the series was not made with kids in mind because the cover indicates that its a humorous take off on James Bond/Spy series something a kid should be able to enjoy.,1433548800,,262,4.26
1795157,4,B00006WUWP,"When I first saw this film in 2002, I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. The opening sequence with Tom Cruise and Stephen Spielberg is over-the-top, and so many of the sequences are hilarious - the mannequin pis asparagus joke is probably the funniest I've ever seen in a film, the shadow scene was pretty funny, as were the scenes of young Austin and young Dr Evil in high school; the casting is also stellar, with Michael Caine as perfect as Austin Powers' dad as Beyonce Knowles is as Foxy Cleopatra. Unfortunately... the title character is a letdown, and even more annoying than Bat Fastard (if that's possible... but it is... it IS!!), although his sumo scenes weren't too bad.

Some of the quotes are hilarious, like ""Preparation H feels good, on the whole"" (on the hole). Dr Evil's Silence Of The Lambs scene is great, the list of ""things to do before I die"" rocks, the GR8 SHAG license plate, the Osbournes cameo, Nigel Powers' Roger Moore moves, ""quid pro quo"" ""squid pro roe"". ""If these lips could talk..."" ""It's long and hard and full of sea men."" ""Even stink would say that stinks."" Laser sharks!! Scott Evil's combover. P Diddy tattoo. ""Sha-zam!!"" There are even cool outtakes at the end credits, with more OZZY!!",1431993600,,1240,4.662100456621005
1795158,5,B00006WUWP,I love all of the dirty humor. LOL.,1431734400,,35,3.5
1795159,4,B00006WUWP,"Mike Meyers three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). Whats interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as hes his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.

Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, Im admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, Oh, beHAAAve, which never struck me as funny, just gay.

Ive since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.

Goldmember is my second favorite of the trilogy behind The Spy Who Shagged Me. It has the best opening, by far, with unexpected cameos and the first half is often laugh-out-loud funny. If it kept up the laughs it wouldve taken first prize, but the second half loses its mojo, while still being likable and amusing. Beyonc takes the place of Heather Graham as Austins babe while Fred Savage plays Number Three and Michael Caine appears in a pretty significant role.

Best quote: Riiiiiiigggghhhttt.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Reno, Nevada; Moab, Utah; and England.

I'm not speaking out of any puritanical objection to grossness in itself in a film: there is a long tradition of comic grossness in art, but for grossness to be comic, you have to do something with it. This film doesn't. If there were an academy award booby prize, Goldmember would deserve it.

The inclusion of Goldmember was odd, to say the least.  He isn't the most entertaining villain, which adds to the thought that Myers is certainly stretching himself a tad too thin in this film.  He was so enthusiastically on top of his game in the original Austin Powers film, but like the Johnny Depp in those Pirate films, his shtick starts to grow tired here.

1795304,4,B00006WUWP,"The Austin Powers series in a lot of ways is like the Waynes World films in that it defines a generation by pointing out its biggest personality traits and making fun of them. Waynes World pointed out the camp, moronic nature of many hardcore old school rock fans and their dedication for the genre. Austin Powers is a character that defines the campness of the groovy 60s, not necessarily hippie fashion, but more fun loving groovy cats who just wanted to have a good time.

The character is broadly based around James bond and the velvet suit with Beatle Boots was actually worn by a George Lazenby incarnation of Bond. Mike Myers took his humour and expressed it in a character that worked on so many levels and took him to the sky in relation to recognition, and arguably the success of this particular will never be matched. With Austin Powers, Myers has now run the risk of the character becoming bigger than the actor and the humour itself. The catchphrases and groovy look are great and present a fun atmosphere, but this now runs the risk of the catchphrases overtaking any form of introduction of new humour.

The character is no bad thing and the silly wit from the mind of Myers only helps the movies, but unless it was Myers intention, the character has now become bigger than its creator and it is obvious in this film. The story focuses around Austin who faces a new foe who teams up with Dr. Evil. The new foes name I hear you ask? Goldmember, and his criminal calling card is turning his victims members gold. Goldmember and Dr. Evil team up to build a tractor beam that will pull a meteor into the earth and melt the ice caps. Austin, with the help of a new companion by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra, has to travel back to 1975 to save his father and stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.

The plot's simple enough don't you think? I suppose what Myers sought to achieve with this was character progression more than anything as we see Dr. Evils son, Scott become evil. The new character of Goldmember is something not too appealing in the film, as it seems he's there to simply promote some form of ""look how the foreigner talks funny"" vibe, and the joke gets really old quite quickly. After about the first 5 minutes of being familiar with Goldmember, I think even Myers realised this character couldn't achieve anything better and after his original ""comic"" entrance he just ended up sitting in silence a lot.

The real introductory gems of the entire film are Foxxy Cleopatra played by the devinely beautiful Beyonc Knowles, and Nigel Powers played by the legendary Michael Caine who looks surprisingly young. Foxxy Cleopatra is the breath of fresh air in what generally is a redoing of all the old gags. She's a woman with talent and attitude and is like many women before her, after Austins heart. Michael Caine seems very much at home playing Nigel Powers as it seems a character very close to his own personality. The cheeky cockney geezer always up for a good time with the ladies is something very befitting of Caine.

The setting is great and the comedy is just fantastic (the new stuff anyway) but I felt the movie fell short. Apart from the genuinely amazing intro and the odd bit here and there, the film just felt a lot like the previous two with a lot of the old gags done once again. Once is fantastic, twice is okay, but the same joke for the third time becomes a bit tiresome. I have to wonder that with a fourth installment in the works, just how soon will it be before Myers decides to drop the old boring jokes and create some new ones.",1232323200,,3567,4.506955177743431

1795317,3,B00006WUWP,"Say anything three times and it's funny, according to the secret rules of sure-fire comedy (the same rules that say the word ""chicken"" is unfailingly a rib-tickler). Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers's third incarnation of his gormless but irrepressible swinging sixties British spy, really is pretty funny.

After three movies and six years of the shagadelic, flouncy-shirted, buck-toothed homunculus and his ever-expanding cartoon world, it's become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against Men in Black or Mr. Deeds or any of a host of other barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious: Myers's sheer fertility of invention is of a different order, and even if he misses as often as he hits, he's definitely a swinger.

Even if the gag-to-wince ratio isn't high, there are enough punchlines thrown here to make a sphinx smirk. Father, forgive me, I must confess: I sprayed my popcorn.

Powers, the self-adoring spy whom Myers says he invented one day while riding back from hockey practice and listening to Dusty Springfield sing The Look of Love on the radio, is not so much a spy spoof (the sixties were already crawling with spy spoofs) as nostalgic sixties anglophilia: Think of it as James Bond crossed with the Carry-On Gang, or maybe Jerry Lewis imagining he's Cary Grant. The character(s) -- Myers plays four parts here, three of them villains -- finds that tightrope between enviable childish narcissism and obnoxiousness where much comedy struts.

The successor to the massive success of the $200-million second instalment of the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, starts off with a large bang, and not, this time, of the sexual nature. Instead, it's a series of scenes from a film within the film, featuring a cast of stars way too famous to be named and an action stunt that should make the James Bond franchise pack up its product placements and go home.

Dr. Evil, Myers's best character, with his pinky-chewing and air quote signs and poor ability at higher numbers, takes centre stage early. Having found a way of taking his unscrupulous behaviour into legitimate business by taking over a Hollywood agency business (he charges just 9 per cent instead of the usual 10), he's stationed himself in a lair above the Hollywood sign and is concocting one of his usual plans to blackmail the world's leaders for a largish amount of money.

The entire evil cast (with the exception of the bald cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, who seems to have dropped out between trailer and movie) is back -- Dr. Evil's annoying son, Scott (Seth Green); Dr. Evil's silent clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who proves he has a mind of his own, and the rest of the Evil cast, including Number Two (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). Myers hides himself under a couple of tonnes of makeup as an obese Scotsman, Fat Bastard, who is in love with his own body effluents.

Myers also plays a new Dutch villain called Johann Van Der Smut, a middle-aged seventies playboy nicknamed Goldmember (regrettable smelting accident), who enjoys roller-skating, disco dancing and eating strips of his overtanned skin.

The best piece of casting falls on the side of good, with Michael Caine as Nigel, Austin's swinging, and insufficiently paternal, spy dad. Caine (who himself played a bespectacled spy in The Ipcress File) looks the part, and turns on some real actor intensity, especially in his raging declaration that he hates intolerance and Dutch people.

Austin, for some reason, has to travel back to swinging Manhattan to ""Studio 69,"" to rescue his dad, who has been captured by the evil Van Der Smut. There, he teams up with Pam Grier-inspired Foxxy Cleopatra, played by pop diva Beyonc Knowles of Destiny's Child, who has great abs and a way of looking at Austin as if she just scraped him off the bottom of her platform shoes.

There's no doubt that Goldmember has its long flaccid stretches, and a good deal of repetition of familiar gags: shadow play, inadvertently obscene subtitles and an assortment of euphemisms for genitalia. At times, Myers's toilet-bowl humour overfloweth.

The strategy here is the basic Mel Brooks string o' gags school of comedy. While it's not high wit, it never stops trying and, occasionally, as in the prison-rap number inspired by Hard Knock Life from Annie, the results are inspired.

A flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil's early days at the Intelligence Academy, for example, shows a savvy such scenes rarely manage; the young actors are close enough physically to the adult characters, but what makes it work is Myers's dubbing in their adult voices.

Fourth-time Austin Powers is a spectre that can only arouse apprehension. No one can look forward to a bigger role for Van Der Smut (or bigger rolls for Fat Bastard). Who cares if Mini-Me decides to talk? But taking a page from the International Man of Mystery, let's not worry about the future when the present (and past) are groovy. When it comes to Austin Powers, three's a charm. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216598400,,5018,4.931279620853081

1795334,4,B00006WUWP,"Austin Powers in GOLDMEMBER

Not a bad movie at all. Pretty funny, but not as funny as Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me.

Should've given more dialog to Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child); instead, she's just the next girlfriend for Austin, and not a more fleshed-out character, like Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley before her.

The character of Goldmember, while not in the film a lot, could've been cut down a bit more. He isn't particlularly interesting. He's not as evil as Dr. Evil, and not as disgusting as Fat [...], and comes off as a washed out amalgam of the two.

Fred Savage, from TV's ""The Wonder Years,"" is good in his two scenes as ""the Mole.""  It's Dr. Evil, as usual, who steals the show, however. And it's a pretty good show.

  Later in the movie i thought ""what happened to Felicity (Heather Graham)? well i don't know and i guess they forgot about her but the movie starts to fall apart Austin Powers(Mike Myers)meets Goldmember(Mike Myers) and thats where the worst character in the movie comes. he is just gross little kid humor over PG13 humor.

THE OTHER ACTORS SUCH AS, MICHAEL CAINE(NIGEL POWERS), BEYONCE KNOWLES(FOXY CLEOPATRA), AND VERNE TROYER (MINI-ME), CREATIVELY SUPPORTED MYERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE.

THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DR. EVIL AND MINI-ME(VERNE TROYER) IS A LAUGH RIOT. THE FILM INTRODUCES NEGLECTFUL DADDY ISSUES, FOR EXAMPLE, AUSTIN'S DADDY (MICHAEL CAINE) ALWAYS INGNORED AUSTIN AND SCOTT EVIL(SETH GREEN) STILL TRYING TO IMPRESS DR.EVIL.

1795355,5,B00006WUWP,"After ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" grossed $ 204 million at the box office, it seemed inevitable that a third Austin Powers would soon hit theaters. In 2002, ""Austin Powers In Goldmember"" was released. Though it did not gross as much as expected, this third outing is just as funny as the first two films and some ways funnier.

Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) have escaped from prison and have enlisted the help of Dutch criminal mastermind Goldmember (also Myers). They locate Austin's father Nigel (Michael Caine, perfectly casted), kidnap him and take him back to 1975. Austin is reluctant to rescue, as his father has never been their for him for all the important events in his life. But his heart leads him in the right direction, as he rescues his father and also finds yet another love interest: Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles). Dr. Evil and Golmemeber have hatched yet another dastardly plan for world domination. Austin, Fozy and Nigel must save the day, and yes, the results are hilarious. And if the ending is somewhat trite, well, that's the way it was written.

This film is great. However, it should be note that is not for fans with a sensitive stomach. The first ""Austin Powers"" hinted at gross out humor, and ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" crossed the line slightly, but neither took it to the extremes this film goes to. Fat B*stard is even more disgusting this time around.

But the only problem is that there were too many camios, many in which didn't even have to be needed (such as Britney Spears? And the funny thing about her entrance is how it look as if she can't even lipsync properly in a movie either). But the beginning of the film was the funniest part of the whole movie if you ask me. But then everything starts to die down a bit with all the bathroom humor, which to me seems a bit childish, something that only little boys would laugh at.

Take for instance Dr. Evil, who in the first movie was almost serious, and anything comedic was often very subtle, not trying for the laughs, but getting them in a unique fashion.  In ""goldmember,"" however, evil is completely out of character and it gets almost ridiculous at times.  Although these characters are all funny, they've all gone through their own ""personal evolution.""
""goldmember"" is filled with many memorable moments which is why I still have respect for the series.  The opening of the movie is probably one of the greatest openings for a comedy I have ever seen.  I'm sure many can agree to that.  The whole part with Mr. Roboto is witty and smart, poking fun at our use of subtitles.  The movie also has another great scene behind a curtain, which mirrors another scene in the second movie, where it looks like heather graham is pulling grenades, rats, umbrellas, and other objects out from Austin's behind.  However, the scene in ""goldmember"" involves Austin and Mini Me in a hospital room during a rountine physical.  I also have respect for Mike Myers himself, who plays the parts of 4 characters in Austin, Dr. evil, fat bastard, and goldmember.  So all in all, an allright comedy.  It has its moments, but it also has those moments that just go too far and are completely off base with what the first movie in the series was trying to illustrate.  I've heard that a fourth picture is most likely in the works, which I hope they can turn around the series with a final movie that Austin Powers fans truly deserve.",1077753600,,1873,4.656534954407295

1795384,4,B00006WUWP,"The third and possibly last installment of the Austin Powers series pits England's favorite international man of mystery against his old nemesis Dr. Evil and his brand new partner Goldmember. The original Austin Powers grossed only $53 million but the movie became a cult favorite on video. New Line, the studio that produced the original, opted for a sequel. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, released in 1999, grossed $205 million by the end of its run. With that success, New Line was more then willing to pay Mike Myers $25 million to come up with another sequel to the hit comedy series. Will the third installment continue the tradition of being better then the last or will it follow the path of most sequels this year and be a piece of trash?
The story goes that Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, has finally captured his archenemy, Dr. Evil. But while Dr. Evil is in jail,Nigel Powers, Austin's father, is kidnapped by Goldmember. Goldmember is an evil Dutch scientist from the 1970's who has a huge obsession with gold. The obsession is so big that he even had his privates turned into gold after an unfortunate smelting accident. When Dr. Evil escapes and plans the destruction of the world, Austin must team up with old flame Foxxy Cleopatra and save the world and his father.  The story for Austin Powers in Goldmember is well paced but much less so then Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The film has tons of great moments within the course of the film but in between those moments the story slows greatly and for extended periods of time. It also gets a little confusing in the end with the involvement of Austin's family, which will not be revealed in this review, but it seems to work out. Some fans of the comedy series may be disappointed though by the revelations.
Mike Myers plays four characters this time in the new installment of the series. He portrays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastuard, and the title character, Goldmember. Myers seems to pay off with each of these characters except Goldmember. Goldmember seems tobe a pointless character and just plaindisguisting especially when he eats his own peeling skin. The character doesn't sound very Dutch and the Dutch jokes seem to be non-stop and annoying after some time. Some of the jokes may be a little offense to those that are Dutch but obviously this film was not intended to appeal to that kind of audience. Beyonce Knowles is one of the worst parts in Austin Powers in Goldmember. She is very attractive but the fact is that she is feels very out of place within the film. It's not her fault that her character isn't given many funny lines. Seth Green is even funnier as Dr. Evil's son especially when he decides to take over the family business. The baldness is scary but in a funny sort of way. Verne Troyer reprises his role as Mini-Me, the 1/8 sized clone of Dr. Evil, with many funny moments in the sequel. Most of the cameos in the film pay off greatly and are in perfect tune.
Overall, Austin Powers in Goldmember is better then the original but still not as funny as the first sequel. There were many things to pick at including the running time which seemed too short at only an hour and thirty-four minutes in length. Second, Beyonce Knowles isneither great nor is she bad in this film but definitely feels out of place. Her '70's one liners begin to get tiresomenear the end of the film. Third, the film slows down for extended periods of timebefore picking up again. This becomes annoying at keeping the audience interested. Most of the cameos worked very well but not all them. The Britney Spears cameo seemed very pointless. Though it suspected that she would end up being a Fembot, it just seemed like a cheap way for her to get into the film and be part of the soundtack for the film. The other cameos, though, are hilarious coming from Tom Cruise,Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey, and Danny Devito especially in the opening ten minutes which are probably the best part in the entire film. Though the film isn't perfect, the entire experience is totallyunforgettable. This film may not appeal toeveryone since there is a huge amount of potty humor but most people will find something to giggle at. Not the best comedy of the year but still a funny diversion for the summer time blues.",1075248000,,4306,4.650918635170604
1795385,3,B00006WUWP,"Goldmember is the third in the series of the tales of the legendary Austin Powers-who makes women everywhere swoon despite his apparent ghastly looks, who can crack any mystery, and is the overly-emphasized embodiment of the 1960's hippie-ideals as they appear to the later generations: free love and lots of bright colors for everyone. Albeit one must admit the flamboyant hippish flair of the movies have given way to downright rude and uncouth sex and bathroom jokes. Funny-as-ever British humor? Or well on its way to becoming a worn-out clich? It's something that depends entirely on the mood and whims of the viewer. For tried-and-true Mike Myers fans, from Wayne's World to Austin Powers and Shrek, Goldmember is a sure laugh. For those who are tired of the same jokes in every movie, as Ozzy Osbourne himself complains, the trademark fun is likely to be a bore.
Mr. Powers is out to save the world again in his third box office hit with lots of naughty innuendo. His father, Nigel Powers (Sir Michael Caine), has been kidnapped by Dr. Evil, Austin's arch-enemy. This time Dr. Evil's collaborator is Goldmember, the Dutch maniac who had a tragic smelting accident and thus, metonymically as it must be in Austin Powers, has ""gilded tallywhackers"" and his ""meat and two veg painted goooold"". Austin Powers is hard-pressed to overcome the traumas created by a bad father-son relationship as he has to discover the whereabouts of his father and rescue the world from another attempt of its destruction. In the end, it turns out that Dr. Evil and Austin are long-lost brethren, and all enmity and animosity between them is forgotten. Scotty (Seth Green), who once opposed his father's world-conquering aims, now declares his father a ""sissy"" and begins to show disturbing signs of inheriting the Evil-associated traits, yearning to take over the world being one of them. All of the other evil sidekicks return in Goldmember: Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mini Me (Verne J. Troyer), Number Two (Robert Wagner), not to mention Fat Bastard, who is played by none other than Mike Myers himself. These multiple roles of Mike Myers (Austin himself, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember) are reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor, which was also a hit comedy.
Goldmember is for those who revel in traditional British humor, which has not changed a bit in the years. Dr. Evil, welcoming Austin to his ""underground lair"", a submarine, describes it as ""long and hard and full of seamen"". Another joke that is simultaneously very British and very Austin, is the name of the newest mission to destroy the world, and all comments related to it. [Dr. Evil:] ""Yes, Frau, on the whole Preparation H feels good."" [Scotty:] ""Yes, Preparation H does feel good on the hole."" This repetition of the same themes that comedians have been using for years is the key to the success of Austin Powers. He is Americanized, yes, by tying his jokes into everyday American products-the hemorrhoid cream Preparation H being one of them-but nevertheless he is doubtless British at heart. Austin Powers has developed his own signature scenes and jokes, without which the movie would lack the intangible something-the mojo-that makes the outrageous Austin Powers world what it is. The repetition of the same jokes has created well-known Austin Powers trademarks, and it's tying the slightly altered jokes to the previous ones that makes them funny. But by far the best scenes in the movie are the ones lacking the uncouth bathroom jokes and sexual overtones that are no longer playful hinting and suggesting, but downright crude.
 A ludicrous opening dance scene that portrays the multiple talents of the leading actor is a must-have element of the movies, and it's a scene, by being unspoiled by repetitive sexual jokes, that depicts Austin Powers at his best. The Dr. Evil and Mini Me sing-and-dance scene is legendary: this time it's the Evilized version of Puff Daddy's ""Hard Knock Life"", while in the previous episode it was Will Smith's song that was given the honor. Another scene that can be classified as one of the rare, truly good ones in the movie, is one that delves a bit deeper into the mind of Austin Powers. It's a flashback into the boyhood of Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Number Two as they are all in the academy in which international men of mystery are trained. We learn that bold and brave sex symbol Austin may not be as gallant a knight as we have been lead to believe. Although the father-son relationship is made into a joke, it's a subtle way of taking a stand against the evils of society. The same goes for Fat Bastard, who talks about how hard it is being ""a fat kid in a society that demands perfection"". Despite this deep insight being turned into another fart joke, truth can be found in his words.
It's comforting that, although nothing seems to be holy enough for the British to not be laughed at, serious insight can be squeezed in amidst all the parody.",1074384000,,4976,4.861012956419317
1795386,3,B00006WUWP,"Finally, the law of diminishing return has caught up with Austen's latest offering.  This movie is rather short compared with the earlier two movies.  It concluded at a mere 1 hour 24 minutes.  The tirade old jokes seemed to be running out of puff.  Whereas in the earlier offerings, we would be laughing our heads' off, in this instance, we might chuckle here & there.  There were many unexpected delightful cameo appearances & you could have mistaken the opening sequence to a John Woo's action movie.  I guess it's the charisma of Mike Myers that carried the whole movie.  The supporting cast was stunning particularly Michael Caine who showed his depth & versatility in acting.  I always fancied Roach's direction as his light-hearted & casual approach seemed to motivate the cast to improvise in their actings.  We have seen all the jokes & gags before.  Otherwise, this movie would be a blast.  I'm not surprised that this is the grand finale of this trilogy.  This DVD package is great as it offered many deleted scenes (on the hindsight, those scenes really don't add anything to the movie), documentaries about the production team, cast, choreography team, stunt team, vehicles sourcing team, special effects team, commentaries from Mike Myers, Director, Producer.  Even though this movie is mediocre, it's still a worthwhile movie to watch for a laugh.",1073952000,,1362,5.0

This one features a lot of the same jokes, most of which have just been rehashed from the previous movies.  Same basic scenario: Austin travels back in time to save the world, meets up with some girl, and they team up to save the world together.
Though this movie did have strong sexual themes, they weren't quite as strong as those in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"".
The first part of the movie with Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, etc. was hilarious.  I think that was surely one of the funniest parts of the movie.

However, I like ""Goldmember"" better than Austin Powers 2 because I feel that it offered a little bit more originality.  This doesn't mean that it's neccessarily funnier, though.
The best departure from Austin Powers 2 is the addition of the Foxy Cleopatra character, who gives the film a completely different spin from the first two Austin Powers movies.
The ""Hard Knock Life"" video between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me is exceptionally funny, as is the interaction between Austin Powers and his father.
However, I disliked the ending, and also felt that the ""Goldmember"" character himself was irrelevant to the plot.

1795398,2,B00006WUWP,"I liked Austin Powers I and II but this third one is a total bummer. This movie was made simply to put Hollywood's big shot celebrities and MTV pop culture up on a pedestal. Many of the big shot names made brief and absolutely pointless appearances. Second of all, it doesn't continue off as a sequel to the last movie the way Austin Powers II did. Whatever became of his girlfriend/sidekick (played by Heather Graham) from the last Austin Powers movie? That's a total mystery.
Perhaps a couple of scenes (not too many at all) are funny, but the story line just has no point to it. It becomes very difficult to keep up with because they keep taking time out to throw in these unnecessary scenes featuring famous celebrities, which becomes just plain annoying after a while.
Last, but not least, not only is Beyonce Knowles a bad actress, but she also makes for a poor sidekick for Austin. Her good-girl professional image is not Austin Powers material. What were they thinking??? C'mon folks, Austin Powers is supposed to be the man! He always gets the girl in the end. What happened here??? He had a sexy, attractive woman like Beyonce Knowles next to him and he was scared to even try anything! Did Austin lose his mojo or what? WHATEVER???

The first two movie DVD releases were great. They had the movie with commentary tracks and then a special features menu. For some reason, they decided to make the third one different and use the ""Infinifilm"" gimmick. Personally, I don't care for it. But again, this can be a matter of opinion, as other people seem to really like the way it works, by making many of the special features available during the movie itself.
However, there is one unforgivable problem with this DVD - you cannot PAUSE or FORWARD/REVERSE during play of the movie. By itself, this fact makes this DVD unacceptable. If you want to watch Goldmember on DVD, make sure you have 90+ minutes free with no interruptions, because you CANNOT PAUSE THE MOVIE. I cannot figure out what they were thinking.

It's not like fat bastard where people actually liked him.
Beyonce is a horrible actress. I rather like her music, but she simply has no talent when it comes to acting like something she's not (a 70's swingin roller girl or whatever she was supposed to be).
most of the jokes were reused from the first two movies, and simply not as funny or shocking as they were before.

1795405,3,B00006WUWP,"I was really excited to see that there was going to be a third Austin Powers movie, since I love the first two movies. But when Goldmember came out, I was pretty disappointed. All of the jokes showed up in the last two movies and have been tired out.
In this movie, Austin Power's father is captured by an evil Dutch man named Goldmember. He loved gold so much that when he lost his genitalia in a boating accident, he replaced his ""bits and pieces"" with solid gold. He planned to bring down the comet Midus 22, which was solid gold, onto the North Pole, and flood the Earth. Austin had to travel back in time a time machine at Gold Member's disco in order to save his father and thwart Dr. Evil's and Goldmember's schemems. Not only did this happen, but Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's son, started losing his hair and eventually turned evil at the end of the movie. There is also a surprising ending involving Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Nigel Power's (Austin's dad) that you do not want to miss.
I have heard that there will be another Austin Powers movie in which Scott Evil will be the evil character, but this series of movies has been stretched out to the point of exhaustion. As I said before, most of the jokes have appeared in all three movies, and the plot is almost always the same. Also, it's sometimes like, ""Oh please, how can those characters be so utterly immature and pathetic?""

Its a hit-and-miss affair that loaded with gross-out gags, phallic symbols, and celebrity cameos (some of them actually become small roles). Like its predecessors, this film pushed more than a few buttons with the MPAA .
 Should I bother with the plot? Nah. There are plenty of more comprehensive reviews with plot-synopses  for those who... *ahem* really care about that kind of thing in this sort of film. Lets just say that Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and the despicable Fat B*stard. He also takes on the character of a Dutch madman named Goldmember. If you thought Fat B*stard was foul, wait till you see what this guy does. Or rather, look through some sort of fabric to lessen the impact.
 A lot of the stuff in here, even though it pushes the boundaries of taste far beyond the weak PG-13 rating, is gut-bursting.

1795420,3,B00006WUWP,"While Austin Powers in Goldmember is certainly a funny movie, featuring several of the most classic scenes from the Austin Powers series, it is ultimately something of a disappointment.  We all thought Austin lost his mojo in the second movie, but the series itself ran off and left its mojo behind early on in this third film.  It's hard to explain, but this just doesn't even feel like a movie to me.  I was still waiting for the movie to really kick in to serious gear when the credits began rolling.  There seem to be serious problems with the plot and script; too many things just happen for no apparent reason, giving the impression that the filmmakers were not overly concerned with maintaining the causality of the storyline.  One thing that really bothered me was Austin's appearance out of nowhere early on to arrest a newly-returned Dr. Evil.  The plot required Dr. Evil to go to prison, but, after watching him escape from his nemesis over the course of two movies, seeing Dr. Evil captured so easily seemed a great disservice to such a great character.  The ending is also disappointing; I hope this is not the final Austin Powers movie, but it certainly wraps up in series-ending style; while predictable, such an ending would not have been terribly bad if the filmmakers had put more effort into injecting some life or suspense into it; as it is, things turn out quite silly, with only one character turning away from the sappy denouement and implanting us with hope that we may see Austin return some day.
Goldmember, a new fourth character played by Mike Myers, may well be the worst character in the history of motion pictures.  While he could be slightly amusing on occasion, Goldmember's unnecessary, disgusting, corny role shot big holes into the movie named for him.  The roller skates, the skin-eating, everything about the man turned me off completely.  The Mole, in my opinion, was yet another terrible character.  No one enjoyed Fred Savage's performance in The Wonder Years as much as I did, but both he and his character looked uncomfortably out of place in the presence of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.  I also, to be quite frank, disapproved mightily of the disservice done to Heather Graham's character of Felicity Shagwell from the second film; I wanted an explanation for her absence, but all I got was a new character in the form of Foxxy Cleopatra.  Beonce Knowles did an admirable job in the role, but to me her character just doesn't fit, and Austin's largely absent mojo flexing in the ladies' department made me feel as if I were watching Austin going about his business as an old man.
All criticism aside, there are some classic moments in this film.  The opening is brilliant, producing some of the most memorable cameo appearances to ever hit the big screen.  Even this cannot compare to the scenes featuring the young versions of Austin and Dr. Evil, however.  Josh Zuckerman did a great job aping the mannerisms and inflections of Dr. Evil, but Aaron Himelstein was all over the young Austin Powers role; he had Austin's look, expressions, mannerisms, and voice down pat; it's really one of the most impressive impersonation jobs I've ever seen.  The humor and entertainment, though, are just too few and far between for the movie as a whole.  I think the plot holes could have been plugged effectively by a couple of the deleted scenes included on the DVD, yet a number of those deleted scenes were mercifully cut from the final print before doing even more self-inflicted damage to this disappointing sequel of a sequel.

It's essentially the same thing that happens with the later Eddie Murphy movies:  we've got a star, let's show everyone how great he thinks he is.

The sight gags were pretty funny all the way thru and the beginning of the movie was priceless.  I really thought I was in for a great movie after the first 15 minutes (won;t spoil it by describing it)...  but I think, for me, it went downhill.  I will say that my son totally enjoyed himself the whole way thru.
I think the problem with the movie was that all the other movies were spoofs on 60's spy movies, where as this one seemed to be a spoof of the other austin powers movies.  Maybe it was a subtle difference, but for me it made a huge difference.  The other movies seemed funny as a whole...this one seemed funny only becuase of the sight gags and off the wall (and off color) humor...  Another subtle difference...but it made a ddfference to me.

Can I tell you, I actually walked out of the theater. And I NEVER walk out of movies.
How many times can you do the same joke and have people still laugh? Apparently, only twice, the third is too much.
The beginning, is amazing, but after the hysterical opening sequence, it all goes down hill. Fat Bastard's painfully long description of the smell of his passed gas, the Mole's mole gag that went on for five minutes too long (and five minutes might as well be an hour in comic timing), the cheesy ""Mr. Roboto"" joke- it was HORRIBLE!

However, with repeated viewings, the movie grows on you.  Just don't expect any plot.  All of the recurring characters are back (except Mustafa, what's wrong, didn't they want to kill him again?), and the new players Foxxy Cleopatra, Goldmember, and Nigel Powers (played quite well by Michael Caine) all fit in nicely as well.  A nice addition also is Fred Savage as a ""mole"" planted in Dr. Evil's organization.
What little plot there is concerns a collaboration across time between Dr. Evil, back from space, and Goldmember, the owner of a swinging disco lounge in 1975 New York City, to destroy the world, just because they are evil and that is what evil guys do.  In order to stop Austin Powers, they decide for some strange reason to kidnap his father in 2003 and hold him hostage in 1975.  Without betraying too much of what little plot there is, let me just say that if you've seen the first two movies, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.

This ""Infinifilm"" DVD looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous. The widescreen (2.35:1) picture is crystal clear without a scratch to be seen. It also has bright colours and a great 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.
Being an Infinifilm DVD, there are plenty of extras. There are a ton of documentaries, a strangely uninformative fact track, a commentary by Mike Myers and Jay Roach, Music Videos, Trailers, DVD-Rom stuff, and Deleted Scenes. The deleted scenes, however, are the one big disappointment of this DVD. I read an article in a magazine a week after the film came out in theatres saying the DVD would contain cameos by Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham, a scene with Will Ferrell's Mustafah character, and more.

A lot of the classic characters return, along with new babe Foxxy Cleopatra and new villian Goldmember (whose disgusting habit of picking his skin and eating it crossed the gross-out line).

In this installment (very basically), Dr. Evil is back on his mission to destroy the Earth and he calls on Goldmember for help with his plan titled 'Preparation H'. To keep Austin Powers occupied, they kidnap his father Nigel. Austin and Foxxy foil Dr Evil's plan and save the planet.

My favorite part is all of the pop culture references - the Osbournes make cameos and Fat Bastard goes on the Jared/Subway diet! There are also some crazy, unexpected twists that I do not want to give away, but they leave the door wide open for at least a couple more sequels....",1046476800,,866,4.544871794871795
1795438,4,B00006WUWP,"When I first heard of this movie I found myself saying, ""Another Austin Powers movie, whoop-de-doo Basil.""  I had always liked the other two, but I just couldn't see anything funnier being added to the Austin Powers frachise.  I was dead wrong.
Goldmember is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  I don't usually laugh out loud during movies, but I did so multiple times on this one.  It was just plain hillarious!  ""Welcome to my underwater sub.  It's long, hard and full of seamen!""
""After saying that, I do have some suggestions.""  Despite it's comedy, there is some flaws.  The main plot wasn't the best and wasn't consentrated on.  The deal with Austin's dad was very good, but the rest of the plot didn't get very much attention.  The first two had very good plots and funny parts, while Goldmember is full of funny and has some good plot parts.  Also, the ending wasn't quite satisfying.  There was something in the end that happened in the first two but not in Goldmember.  Oh well.
All in all Goldmember is an extremely funny movie and worth every minute.  The new cast members are good and worthy of the Austin Powers franchise.  I just thought that Foxxy and Austin should have had a closer relationship.  I mean they were supposed to have been going out earlier, they didn't have to go through all the flirting and slow movements again.  Oh well.  It's a great movie if you want a good laugh and I highly recommend it.",1044921600,,1436,4.54296875
1795439,5,B00006WUWP,"Bought the DVD to watch on my laptop with my friend who was sick in the hospital.  Needed a comedy to cheer us up.  I bought it only because neither of us had seen it before.
As it turned out, it was the best of the Austin Power trio of movies.
The actual Goldmember character was boring -- and I still don't like Fat Bastard.  But Mini-Me was funnier than ever before, and I was unexpectedly surprised by Beyonce Knowles (who is also gorgeous in this movie).  Story is a bit weak -- but the individual scenes are truly funny.  Best ones are Austin Powers and the fountain, & Austin and Mini-me walking in the hall-way, and Austin and Mini-me in the doctor's office.  The final part of the doctor's office is classic -- laughed and laughed and laughed.
Highly recommended -- didn't expect I would like it so much.",1044403200,,813,4.386666666666667

1795441,4,B00006WUWP,"By now I'm sure the only way you would want to see this movie is if you liked the first two.  And that's fair to say.  You either love the Austin Powers saga or you don't.  It's as simple as that.  Very rarely do we find a second, far more a third, sequel that can hold our attention like the first did.  I mean, even Jaws 3 wasn't that good.
But Mike Myers is at it again, dreaming up new ideas, new characters, and even a new ending.  I was most surprised by the ending of Goldmember.  I can't say I was eagerly awaiting it, but I was kind of hoping for a better ending.  I'm not going to tell you anything about the ending; other than the fact that there will be an Austin Powers 4.  They make sure of that.  I don't know how many more of these spoofs we'll be able to take.  Our sides will be split open from laughter.
Anyway, about the third one: it's very funny.  It's funnier than ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" but not as good as the original Austin Powers.  And if you read the cast list for this one, you will find cameos from Ozzy Osborne, Britney Spears, Steven Spielberg, John Travolta, Danny DeVito, and even Fred Savage (from ""The Wonder Boys"", and his part's a bit more than a cameo).  Fred Savage plays Number 3, and has a huge mole on his face.  This, as you can imagine, provides for some of the best laughs of the Austin Powers series.  There is also a new girl.  After Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham, it's hard to find another great replacement.  Beyonc Knowles, singer of Destiny's Child, plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra.  And she does okay.  I will say that she wasn't as good as either Liz or Heather, but it worked out pretty well.
Again, this goes without saying, if you liked either Austin Powers 1 and/or 2, then you will surely like this one.  If you hated the first 2, then you will hate this one as well.  Otherwise you are in for a pleasent surprise at the end.",1044230400,,1894,4.188365650969529

Mike Myers is amazing. He can pull off so many characters so well that he is practically a one-man show.  The movie itself also boasts a pretty interesting and wacky storyline that Austin Powers fans will really enjoy. If you have not seen the previous two movies, it is not really necessary to, though you should take the time to see them.  In the movie itself, we meet Austin's father, a new villain named Goldmember, the new spy girl Foxy and a bunch of the characters from the previous movies. They take part in a crazy new adventure that is as bizarre as it is funny, and in the end, leaves room for a sequel, to the delight of all the fans.
This is not a bad DVD to check out if you were thinking of getting it.  Lots of great stuff is featured on the DVD and the movie is very entertaining.",1043712000,,1064,4.180487804878049

1795445,3,B00006WUWP,"""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is the third (and hopefully final) installment of the popular James Bond spoof series. The reason I say final is not because the movie is bad, but because it's so entertaining and works so hard to tie up all loose ends that a fourth movie would have little chance of topping it. This time around, Austin must stop Dr. Evil from melting the polar ice caps with a device known as ""Preparation H."" Along the way, he must travel through time, reconnect with an old girlfriend, reconcile with his father, and battle the insane Goldmember.
Part of what makes ""Goldmember"" work is that there is some semblance of a plot this time around. While the plot is still just an excuse to string together gags, it manages to reference events from the other movies, the Austin Powers mythos, and even toss is a few twists in the ending. Yes, the emotional revelations are played for laughs, but they resonate just enough to give a sense of purpose to the adventure, something that was missing from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" The acting is top notch. Mike Myer's ability to play four distinct characters is impressive, and Goldmember is highly memorable. Beyonce Knowles gives energy and personality to Foxxy Cleopatra, and Seth Green and Verne Troyer continue to develop their characters. Michael Caine, in his limited screentime, is hilarious as Austin's father.
Of course, the series depends on its gags, and while not everything is funny, enough of it is that the ... bits don't matter. Thankfully, the screentime of a certain obese character has been toned down, along with most of the jokes involving body fluids. What we have left are clever perspective tricks, musical numbers, shadow play, a funny subtitles joke, parodies within parodies, and lots of celebrity cameos. All in all, while ""Goldmember"" doesn't have the originality of the first film, it comes in a very close second.
While the audio and video for the disc are both top-notch, I have to say the supplements disappointed me. New Line's infinifilm concept does nothing for me - it's a glorified version of the ""follow the white rabbit"", ""007 logo"", and countless other extended branching play options on other DVDs. What's worse is that it forces the extras to broken down into several little tidbits that aren't as long as they should be. Goldmember definitely had enough extras for a 2-disc treatment, and use of Infinifilm meant stuff was left out (including the Liz Hurley/Heather Graham deleted scenes). Other than that, this DVD is still highly entertaining and worth picking up for Austin Powers fans.",1043452800,,2590,4.902050113895217

The rating chart doesn't give that so I just rounded up to 3 stars. I found this movie just ok. The jokes were the same alot from the second and third to this one. The only real good new joke was the ""fook me, fook yu"" joke.
  The movie is all about Dr. Evil and Mini-me want to flood the world, (their in a submarine), with the help of Goldmember. They get caught by Austin, and go to Jail. Austin Powers gets knighted and his father wasn't there. Austin's Dad gets kidnapped by Goldmember in 1975. (Nigel Powers gets kidnapped after the knighting ceremony.)

The movie is a loosely joined collection of skits about toilet humor, sexual innuendo and a few (very few) funny (very funny) sight gags. My friends at work, some 15 years my junior, all hated it. I give it 2 stars because there are some fun parts that are probably worth seeing. If you really like Mike Myers films, you will enjoy Goldmember.

The movie was actually still quite funny, especially the one-liners(i.e.-""Doctor Evil, I used to think you were crazy, but now I can see your nuts.....I thank you"") All I have to say is Mini Me in the prison scene.....frickin hilarious! Goldmember was pretty disgusting with his toight pants on and his skin problems. Oh, save me from myself yes. hahaha Anyway, this movie still ended up being pretty funny despite some of it's shortcomings. Another thing is that Fat Bastard just isn't as funny this time around. Furthermore, what happened to Austin's camera? I missed that in the movie-""Make an interconnected series of tunnels like the Vietcong.........and I'm spent.""

It has been that because there was either nothing good on that I wanted to see, or I just wasn't hyped on any others like I had been with some others. Now, I do think that Dr. Evil and Mini-Me didn't have to wear those blue contacts, cause it kind of made them look ugly.

But after that, ""Goldmember"" is a hodge-podge of uninspired and been-there-done-that dialogue from the great Mike Meyers.  I'd really hoped for a more lively episode, along the lines of the first two movies, and was clearly disappointed.  Beyonce Knowles - GORGEOUS HERE - is solid as Foxy Cleopatra, but the rest of the cast seems like they are just going through the motions.  Even Meyers himself seems to be channeling SNL characters rather than focusing on making this funny.

1795453,4,B00006WUWP,"I have to admit that all of the Austin Powers' movies are little guilty pleasures, and Goldmember is no exception.  Yes, it is filled with the typical [strange humor] comedy that made the two previous movies so popular, yet its story is unique on its own.  Mike Myers is wonderfully diverse, reprising his roles as Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, while introducing the new character Goldmember (a raving 70's Dutchman who eats his own dried skin...pretty wacky).  Beyonce Knowles plays a great, rather platonic sidekick, and Michael Caine is surprisingly convincing as Austin's ""fahza"".
Many may find the family plotline in this movie rather sappy and even predictable, and the ending may leave faithful Austin devotees thinking ""ok, now what?""  However, Austin is still as endearing as ever, and this movie is an adequate recovery from the rather slow ""Spy Who Shagged Me"".  Heck, the cameos in the intro to Goldmember alone make it a vast improvement.
The infinifilm DVD format is good.  All of the trailers, including my personal favorite featuring Verne Troyer as the mini-Austin Powers, are featured, as well as deleted scenes, music videos, and ""the making of"" featurettes.  This DVD actually has three versions of the movie in its entirety.  The first is just the movie alone; I recommend watching this first.  The second is the movie with infinifilm features inserted (e.g., a deleted scene or a ""how they made this scene"" option is listed at the bottom of the screen at the point in the movie it pertained to);  these are interesting, although some are so short,  I almost wonder why they even bothered.  The third is the movie with Jay Roach (director) and Mike Myers providing commentary of the scenes throughout.  This is funny, although somewhat repetitive of the extra features on the DVD and rather self-gratifying (i.e., Mike Myers and Jay Roach tell you what a joy it was to work with everyone on the cast and how great it is that they made this movie).
All in all, this is a truly funny movie, and the infinifilm features definitely try and give you the inside scoop on the movie.  Although repetitive, if you really liked Goldmember, you won't mind watching it more than once.",1042243200,,2198,4.857908847184986

1795455,3,B00006WUWP,"It's hard to be hard on this movie, since I consider ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" darn near a masterwork. But darnit, ""Goldmember"" just feels like a retread of earlier Austin Power gags, which second time around pretty much don't seem that funny.
It's hard to say why Mike Myers and director Jay Roach resorted to so much self plagerism, but listening to their side by side commentary provides a couple of clues.
Apparently the boys were playing it ""safe"", with Roach, thru-out the production, shortening or deleting certain scenes to ""keep it moving"" because test audiences weren't ""getting it"".
Now that sounds odd to me, because essentially we weren't supposed to ""get it"" in the first movie.  The popularity of Austin Powers was darn near a phenomenon.  But now that we do ""get it"", does this mean that we are in danger of not ""getting it"" subsequent times around?
And why have so much reliance on test audiences?  I'm surprised that Myers and Roach fell for the second guessing game and unfortunately it shows in this movie.
Roach also admits that he wasn't too keen on Goldmember, the character, and kept his screen time at a minimum.  But the out-takes of Myers goofing around with his ""Goldmember"" character are quite funny.  A few more choice scenes of Goldmember would have taken the movie up a notch.  So what if the humour is off-kilter and plainly bizarre.  Bring it on, please!  I am sadly going to be a bit wary of the fourth ""Austin Powers"", if there is one.",1042070400,,1470,4.648648648648648

The only reason I'm writing this review is to warn other potential buyers that the Infifilm encoding on this disc may choke your DVD player.  Specifically, on my Panasonic DVD-RV31 this movie plays great when viewed straight through.  However, shortly after you start playing the movie the Forward Scan, Reverse Scan, and even the Pause button are disabled.  The DVD player sees these buttons and puts up the ""can't do that now"" icon on the upper-right of my TV screen.  It is interesting to note that if you start playing this movie from the main menu you can forward scan all you want, but once you reach the position you're interested in watching and play it for, say, a minute, the Forward, Reverse, and Pause buttons are locked-out.
I've never tried to use the Infinifilm extras:  this problem exists when you simply try to view as a regular DVD and simply want to back the film up or pause, or skip forward.
At least one other reviewer of the movie reported this same problem, but blamed it on the disc.  I'm suggesting that it could be a problem with certain Panasonic players, or a very unfortunate combination of issues:  perhaps Infinifilm is attempting to exploit features on this disc that are in a gray-area of the DVD standard and Panasonic implemented those features in a slightly different way from expected.
We have viewed two other Infinifilm DVDs on our Panasonic with no apparent problems:  13 days and Rush Hour 2.  But, again, we never tried to use the extras, so the Goldmember disk is definitely unique.
The bottom line:  rent or borrow this movie and test it out on your machine before buying it.  Then, get it!!!  It's Hilarious!!!",1041897600,,1875,4.6626139817629175

The DVD has several wonderful features in it: The Infinifilm opition which allows you to watch the movie and access speical features that tells you about how the movie was made and the concept of everything. However, there were several features in the DVD that made the DVD worse. First off, unlike most DVD's the DVD was in the Full Screen Version, which cuts off part of the movie itself.

1795465,1,B00006WUWP,"What makes this movie frustrating is that a lot of work obviously went into it.  This was a big-budget movie, and it looks like they used mega-millions for it's ""look"".  Also, different types of gags took a lot of care to construct.  One of the very few gags that works is a cameo appearance by Nathan Lane, looking very comfortable in drag, mouthing the dialog of the chick from Destiny's Child, while said chick is sitting right behind him.
But disappointingly, there is almost nothing else in this film that was watch able to me, and I thought this one would be enjoyable, which the first one was.  The second had it's moments, but was already getting very repetitive.  This one's totally forgettable.
Going back to the careful construction of gags is partially my point.  It was humorous and creative in the first movie when Powers and his lady friend carefully avoided showing genitalia by all sorts of clever tricks.  Well, they kind of rehash that in reverse with dialog here, showing parts of phrases, which start out as potty humor, but are revealed to be different messages entirely.
Which is the biggest complaint, which is the writing.  The first movie threw a lot of sexual innuendo into the horny Austin Powers character, who not only came from a more promiscuous time, but had a lot of adjustments to make for modern society.  May of these were clever, but there's none of that freshness now. It's now all been replaced by bad pun after assembly-line bad pun, and it wears thin very quickly.
Finally, the title character villain is as uninteresting a character as one can imagine.  Dr. Evil was a pretty good imitation of James Bond Blofeld character, but for whatever reason, they decide to make Goldmember Dutch.  This leaves room for golden wooden shoes as part of the costume, which is only mildly amusing, but then it takes the character absolutely nowhere.
Like the now-defunct Batman series, this one decided to go the route of expensive sets and high-class choreography.  What destroyed both series was the virtual desertion of any kind of original plot whatsoever.  My biggest disappointment is that while Batman died the death it deserved, this one might be around for a few more installments.",1041638400,,2218,4.820580474934037

1795468,3,B00006WUWP,"The best parts of this Austin Powers installment are the beginning and the end.  The middle is a little too over-the-top or just down right stupid.
Goldmember is a character that sounded good on paper.  But seeing him come to life was a disappointment, and at times a real stomach turner.  Myers' Austin Powers is a fun character and I hope he will give us more Austin...but I hope he realizes that his audience is more than 14 year old boys. (The level of gags and jokes in this rarely emerges from the bathroom.  Once or twice in 90 minutes is OK...but relying this much on such low brow humor is just a complete waste of time if you are a viewer.)
That being said, the opening tag is one of the most brilliant gags ever seen.  The strength of this gag (If you don't have tears rolling from your eyes with laughter, you are dead.  It is sheer genius in casting and execution.) mistakenly set up my hopes for an equally strong movie.  The ending as well incorporates a current staple of pop culture send up that makes sitting through the credits a worth-while experience.

1795469,3,B00006WUWP,"As a longtime fan of Mike Myers, this third installment of Austin Powers was mostly one big disappointment (too bad he never got to realize a feature-length film featuring Dieter from Sprockets). Surprisingly short on laughs (except perhaps in Myers' own head), GOLDMEMBER rehashes too many elements from THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, but this time the carryover jokes have been completely drained of life, much of the dialog seems like it was ad libbed -- and poorly at that. For example, Myers has a tendency to linger on Dr. Evil's babbling and facial expressions, most of which is unfunny if not downright awkward this time around. Most punchlines and sight gags fall dismally flat where they could have succeeded had they been delivered with a little more flair (e.g., I could see the Mr. Roboto punchline coming early on, but when it did, it was like a mere footnote). The trip back to the 70's -- so heavily hyped in the previews -- is all-too-brief and the star-studded opening sequence makes this dud seem far larger than life than it actually is. And did anyone notice how inconsequential Austin Powers, as a character, becomes in each successive movie? Still, its worth viewing for a few, gutbusting moments where Myers does in fact deliver.",1041465600,,1246,4.827102803738318
1795470,4,B00006WUWP,"AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMEBER is a fun and fantastic film for those who like, farce, parody and just movies that break that fourth wall and talk to the camera. Michael Meyers (I Married An Axe Murderer, Shrek) is a creative genius with this character and if all he did was make these movies - he would make the world a much better place.
This story takes us back in time to the 70's and even farther back to when Austin Powers, Nigel and even Dr. Evil were in High School together. Keep in mind that Mike Meyers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat Bastard. He does an amazing job and you can't even tell it is him.
Directed by Jay Roach (Meet The Parents, Mystery, Alaska) the film tells the tale of 7's undercover agent Foxy Brown played by Beyonce Knowles (know for the pop group Destiny's Child) who helps track the whereabouts of the Evil Dr. Evil and the disgusting dead skin eating Goldmemeber.
Everyone is back - including Michael York (Logan's Run, Island Of Dr. Monroe) as Secret Defense Leader Nigel and Seth Green (Rock Star, Rat Race) as Dr. Evil misguided and somewhat confused son.
The most amazing thing is all the cameo appearances that are in the movie and how they got everyone to do a minute or two in the film. People like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Gweneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Divito and Nathan Lane to name a few.
The DVD is phenomenal and besides all the extras, the best part is the revoicing studio where you actually put your own voice over the characters and play as if you were in the movie. The extra's including the commentary are extremely funny.
If you have the other two - this is a must have - if you have never seen it - be prepared to laugh hysterically. Get it - you'll love it! (12-31-02)",1041292800,,1748,4.4485981308411215

1795472,5,B00006WUWP,"Although the first two entries in Austin Powers series were definitely worth a look, the latest entry of ""Goldmember"" is by far the funniest of the three.

Everything about ""Goldmember"" is more.  More action, more humor, more flash, more excitement, and certainly more character developement which actually adds a history to the characters.  You know right from the false start when the familiar theme begins as famous movie stars play all the Austin characters,  you're in for a treat.  I liked the appearance of Steven Spielberg and the amusing dance vignette with Brittney Spears too.  After being entertained for several minutes with the pre-show, the main attraction begins.

In this third of the series,  Mike Myers is funnier than ever before, and alter ego Dr. Evil is far more developed in his role too.  In this adventure, Austin goes back to the seventies disco era to find ""Goldmember"" a ""crazy dutch bastard"" according to Dr. Evil who has such a irrepressible fondness for the precious metal, that he has suffered ""an unfortunate smelting accident"" that literally turned his ""member"" to gold!  Talk about the ""Midas Touch""!  Austin travels in his time machine car to the 1975 and lands in a flashy disco called what else, ""Studio 69"" of course.  It is there that he reunites with Foxy Cleopatra played by singer Beyonce Knowles in her acting debut.  Her character, replete with an impossibly huge afro and big bell bottoms, is a combination send-up of Pam Grier's character ""Foxy Brown"" and Tamara Dobsons ""Cleopatra Jones"" of the same era.  There is so much slapstick visual humor in this scene, between the rollerskating double-jointed Goldmember doing impossible kicks, and especially when Austin and Foxy talk without being noticed as a effeminate man sits in between and mouths Foxys every word with the appropriate gestures topped with a big smoochy kiss.  Just the beginning of the fun.

Austin and Foxy decide to team up.  They will go back to the future together where in 2002, she will help save Austins father played by wonderful veteran actor Michael Caine, in a perfectly casted role.  Caine is the quintessential mature British Male, and his air of sophistication is a wonderful touch in contrast to all the absurdity going on in the rest of the movie.  Despite his being the absentee Dad while Austin was growing up, Austin is determined to save dad from the skin eating Goldmember who has kidnapped him. What happens next, and what shocking family secret has been revealed?  Watch and see.

I found this film hilarious from beginning to end.  Dr. Evil is the funniest yet in this edition. The only moment he wasn't was the jailhouse rap scene.  I hated the rapping scene in ""shagged"" and it certainly wasn't needed in a reprise here either.  That part aside, all the usual fun geeks and freaks are funnier than ever.  Frau Farbisina, Seth Greene with a new Hair-don't as son of Evil, Robert Wagner as the ever sombre Number Two, Mini-Me on a chocolate eating bender, the return of a more corpulent than ever Fat Bastard, now as a Sumo Wrestler and at a pinnacle of repugnancy!  Silliest of all, Fred Savage as a moll replete with an actual huge facial MOLE.  This mole horrifies  both Austin and Dr. Evil to the point of distraction and the facial expressions and malaprops that ensue are a comic mole-sterpiece.  You get my point.

If you are looking for a fun escape into the absurd that will make you laugh out loud, then look no further than the BEST Austin Powers yet!",1041206400,,3502,4.8076923076923075

Beyonce Knowles did an OK job in her first movie role but the lack of on-screen chemistry between Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin Powers was disappointing. However, this was made up for by the laugh-a-minute humour that brought tears to my eyes! Fat Bastard was successfully reintroduced in his funniest scene ever and I saw some of the most hilarious, original humour that was far superior to that found in the first two installments of Austin Powers.
The cameos in the opening credits were fantastic and especially entertaining and while the ending was a slight let-down, the jokes were A grade and the visual humour was outstanding.

The movie wasn't as funny as the previous movies in the hilarious series. Destiny's Child member Beyonce Knowles did a good job, but her little ""Shazaam!"" chatch phrase and adding ""Sugar"" to the end of almost every sentence was kinda annoying. The mole jokes were very funny, as was the ""shadow"" scene in the doctor's offfice. One joke that not a lot of people in the theaters I was in (I saw it twice in the theaters) got was the ""Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto"" joke. That was hilarious. They could've done a better job on the joke with the satellite that looked like a big pair of ""...."" because it was easily predictible that they would try to bring that up again. The DVD was pretty good. I'm kinda new to the infiniFILM concept. In fact, I had never heard of it before. I really enjoyed it! It was very cool. I reccomend ""The Spy who Shagged Me"" instead of this movie, but it's still a nice one to own. Enjoy!",1040947200,,1124,4.257009345794392

1795482,1,B00006WUWP,"I may have laughed twice during this movie:  once during the Mini-me cameo scene in the beginning, and once at the Styx joke (with ""Mr. Roboto"").  Otherwise, this movie just didn't do its job.  Realizing right away that the only way to remain smart and funny was to be self-effacing, Mike Myes takes the inane and nonsensical elements of the first two movies and stuffs the movie with them.  The revelations and character development all becomes more and more ridiculous and downright stupid up to the closing scene.  For instance, near  the beginning, Dr. Evil's idioms when chastising Scott turn into garbled dialogue that doesn't even resemble real English.  Instead of saying ""Shh"" or ""Zip it"", he now says something along the lines of ""Rfmsfll"".  Yeah, very funny.  And the film goes downhill from there, folks.

Returning characters such as Fat Bastard and Mini-me have lost the originality that made them humorous.  The new addition, the eponymous Goldmember, is simply not funny at all, and it is a bit difficult to figure out exactly what he's even doing in the movie at all:  it may have been better without him.

The only possible redeeming part of this movie could have been Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra.  Unfortunately, though she was exceedingly likeable and capable in her role, she and Austin shared absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.

Compared to this movie, Wayne's World 2 was brilliant.  Do yourself a favor and watch the first Austin Powers movie again.  Though you've seen it already, it will still be more original than this movie, and at least it will have some sort of plot.",1040688000,,1605,4.885185185185185
1795483,4,B00006WUWP,"Austin Powers in Goldmember was pretty good for a movie and O.k. for the Austin Powers series. Don't get me twisted, I've heard that this will be the last Austin Powers and yes it does go out with a bang in that respect but as far as compared to the first 2, it lags behind a little.
First off, this one has a lot of funny parts (eventhough it's nothing you haven't seen before from the Austin Powers series except for the Japanese subtitles) and there are some pretty entertaining scenes as well. Plus cameos by Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Gwenyth Paltrow, Brittmey Spears, the Osbournes and even John Travolta.
Along with returning characters Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, Basil Expeditionm, Number 2, Scott Evil and Frau Farbissina and who could forget the new additions to the seris, Number 3 played by Fred Savage, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) and title character Goldmember (also played by Myers). All in all, so many names and so much going on, you are constantly glued when watching this one. And a new addition to the series, TWISTS and TURNS in the plot. Trust me, you'll see!
But there are some down sides to this one as well. For starters like I said before, I've heard that this is the last of the Austin Powers series. That knowledge alone brings you down a little. The biggest and most disappointing thing about this one is title character Goldmember. He's not really all that funny. He says a few things here and there but the other things that he does are just disgusting. Even worse than the Fat Bastard/Felicity Shagwell after love scene in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Seriously, Goldmember (the character) is a total loss.
Other than that, it's very worth it. For me personally, I had to rewind the Dr Evil/Mini-Me GA State Prison scene over and over because it's just so dang funny! If you already have the first 2 you might as well get the trilogy and complete the series and for those of you not into the Austin Powers series, you'll still get a kick out of this one.

The first ten minutes are so creative and packed full of cameos (and if you tell your friends who the cameos appearances are  your friends will never forgive you) that it sets the pace for the rest of the film perfectly.  Even the jokes that he has used in past films he somehow manages to renew and make fresh again.  For those parents out there  watch out  this is a very risqu film and should probably have been rated R.  That being said, the adult humor is what makes this film so great in the first place.

1795487,1,B00006WUWP,"First of all I'm a huge Mike Myers fan. I loved the Waynes World movies and Austin 1 and 2. But I feel something went terribly wrong here. This movie doesn't have one single laugh to its name. There's only one person to blame for this mess and that is of course Mike Myers. He does a terrible job at playing his own characters. His Dr. Evil isn't even Dr. Evil anymore. It's just Mike myers with makeup. He doesn't inhabit Dr. Evil's mannerisms that made the first two so funny. He just recycles the jokes from the first two. And worst of all AUSTIN DOESN'T SHAG IN THIS MOVIE. What's up with that. And don't get me started on Beyonce Knowles. Her performance makes Heather Graham look like Meryl Streep. The character Goldmember is disgusting, not funny. The twist at the end is enough to make anyone who likes this series ashamed that they paid money to watch this mess.
It's time Mike Myers puts Austin to rest for good. Any movie that has a dance sequence with Britney Spears at the beginning is pretty desperate for laughs. Most people that say that they like this movie don't want to admit how disappointing it is. It's truly terrible. I didn't go to the movies for four months after seeing this. I was that disappointed. If you like the first two Austin movies, don't watch this by any means. You'll lose respect for the whole franchise and filmmaking itself.

Mike Myers isn't just a great gag man, he also is one of the most inventive filmmakers around today, in terms of seeing the potential use of the medium for fantastical and playful disruptions of ""normal"" perception.

Now saying that, there is also a few neat twists in this movie that I didn't expect. You, too, won't see it coming.
I was impressed with the deleted scenes. They were in very good digital quality as though they could just be slipped right in with the movie and you wouldn't notice the difference in picture quality. I've noticed many DVD movies have crummy picture quality when viewing the deleted scenes. A big bummer, but understandable. But not here, the deleted scenes look fantastic and I appreciate that. Also, I thought that the deleted scenes should have been kept in the movie. They were funny and relatively short. There must have been a good reason to pull them, I just don't see why.
They put some nice touches on several special effects scenes, too. I love special effects and am impressed with what they've done here.
Austin Powers: In GOLDMEMBER is clever, in fact, it's done so cleverly that it really does seem like stupid and senseless intertainment. But that's Austin Powers for ya.

For the most part, this film is very funny.  If you like the crazy, unpredictable capers of the other two films you're bound to enjoy this one, too.  There are even a couple of twists in the plot to keep it interesting.
I really liked this movie, but there are two objections I had to it.  First, I don't like the character of Foxxy Cleopatra.  There just wasn't any chemistry there.  Second, I think some of the jokes are getting a little bit old (like Dr. Evil asking for ransom money and telling Scott to shut up).

1795503,3,B00006WUWP,"""Goldmember"", the third in the Austin Powers spy spoof series, is, like its predecessors, hit and miss. I thought there are more misses laugh-wise in this one, but that may be because the series' novelty has worn off. I suspect its makers know that. They've made the bathroom humor even more over the top. Of course, there is a big audience for such jokes, as the movie's huge boxoffice take demonstrates. For me, though, the jokes got stale about halfway though. Could it be that the writers were under orders not to go anywhere the average thirteen-year old could not follow?
I did thoroughly enjoy the opening sequence, which is a movie within a movie. Powers [Mike Myers] is a technical assistant on the set of a film about his exploits. Lots of major, real life stars have cameos playing Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, etc. There is also a delightful spoof of the classic musical, ""Singing in the Ran"", as well as a hilarious run confrontation with Brittany Spears. None of this has anything to do with the plot, which concerns Dr. Evil's holding the world ransom by threatening to crash an asteroid into the planet. The opening demonstrates what a comedic genius Myers can be, and if the rest of the movie were half as good, it would be a gem.
Perhaps Myers himself would have been happy to have delivered an R-rated movie, for ""Goldmember"" comes as close as it can to that rating without actually getting one. [It's PG-13.] In many scenes, you can almost see the censors' scissors. The dreaded `R' would have theoretically eliminated much of the movie's core audience, but at least it would have been a more honest gross-out comedy. It also might have been a better movie.",1039219200,,1675,4.68135593220339
1795504,2,B00006WUWP,"The first Austin Powers movie was hilarious.  The second movie basically recycled the same jokes, but I laughed anyway, probably because I was reminded at how good the first movie was.  It was comedy by association.  I'm sorry, but I can't give this third movie, Goldmember, the same sort of pity laugh.  There were a few mild chuckles here and there, but it doesn't even come close to reaching the bar set by its two predecessors.
I'd tell you about the plot of the movie, but I couldn't remember what it was even when I walked out of the theater.  Beyonce Knowles did a solid acting job, but it was fairly easy to tell that she was acting in her first movie.  Unlike Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham in the previous movies, Beyonce doesn't serve as Austin's love interest, so there isn't any of the playing hard-to-get that viewers found so funny in the first two.  She's strictly business, which isn't very funny.  There's also a new character added to this movie called Goldmember.  He's a disco-dancing rollerskater who peels off and eats pieces of his own dry skin.  Disgusting?  Yes.  Funny?  No.  And, of course, there's Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Mini-Me, and all the rest of the usual supporting cast.  They each have their funny moments, but not many.
I know several screen writers, and they all say that every scene in a movie is supposed to mean something.  In this case, every scene should either provide some sort of comedy or advance the plot of the story.  There were several scenes in the movie that didn't do either of these.  They were just there holding the movie and its audience in limbo.  Everyone in Hollywood is under pressure to meet deadlines and cut costs, and it was very evident that this pressure played a major part in the making of this movie.  I'm sure the movie studio knew that people were going to see this movie regardless of quality just because the previous movies were successful, so there was no incentive to make a good movie.
I have to admit that I'm a big Austin Powers fan, and if they make a fourth movie I'll definitely go see it no matter how good or bad it is.  Unfortunately, there are alot of other people just like me, and the movie studios know it.",1039046400,,2202,4.5240506329113925

This is slap-stick comedy at its best. Sure, it uses some of the same jokes, and sure it has some potty humor to appeal to the younger crowd, but it's all great fun. I didn't think it was possible, but this is a film franchise that doesn't seem to get worse with each movie - in fact, I think this is the best one out of the lot.

GOLDMEMBER is a rather patchy installment with the threadbare plot having Austin trying to find his father Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) who abandoned him as a child and catching the 70s rollerskating villain Goldmember, also played by Myers. This sequence is shown in a not terribly funny flashback. GOLDMEMBER's opening credits on the other hand are absolutely hilarious, but in this case the movie seems to be centered on gross outs than cleverness. Beyonce Knowles is okay as Austin's blaxploitation sidekick Foxxxy Cleopatra, and of course Myers as Fat Bastard makes sure there is more literal toilet humor to make viewers laugh and blow chunks through their living rooms. There are numerous cameo appearances, including Fred Savage as informant The Mole who has a freakishly big mole on his face. Clever. The movie's ending is a real copout too.

1795513,4,B00006WUWP,"I am not sure why many reviewers and critics hated Austin Powers in Goldmember.  I thought it was incredibly funny movie and the best in the series.  Reviewers stated that Goldmember changed it's humor and that made it less hilarious.  However, every single one of those reviewers is wrong.  In Goldmember, the humor switches from toilet and dirty humor (as shown in the first and second) to complete parody.  And as everyone knows, parody is probably the greatest comedy there is.  If you disagree with me, do not continue reading this review.  In the third installment of the popular series, Austin Powers is once again pitted against Dr. Evil and his henchmen.  However, he must also face off against the sick disco lover Goldmember, a man who plans to either join Dr. Evil in ruling the world, or doing it himself.  Austin goes back in time but unfortunately releases Goldmember in our time and now must catch him.  Helping him is his father (Michael Caine)  and a disco singer from the 60's named Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles).  What follows is a bambardment of jokes, pranks, and a whole lot of fun as the most shagadelive secret agent faces off against his long time enemy.  Austin Powers in Goldmember is a great treat and the DVD is rumored to have many extra features such as documentaries and music vides.  Goldmember is definetely a must buy though I suggest not letting the younger kids watch it since it has a couple crude and sexual jokes.  Highly recommended.
Time: 96 minutes.
Directed by: Jay Roach.
Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor.",1037836800,,1555,4.75
1795514,2,B00006WUWP,"I'll start off by saying I'm a religiously devout Bond fanatic. I did however find International Man Of Mystery and The Spy Who Shagged Me hilarious, and was consequently surprised how bad Goldmember turned out to be.
Indeed, Myers is a funny man, and he's proved he can parody Bond just well enough to save it from becoming a poor copy. The Dr. Evil (obviously Blofeld) and Frau Frabissner (Rosa Klebb) were genuinely side splitting, but in Goldmember, everything seems a little convoluted.
Despite being really mad parodies, the first two films followed a more traditional narrative, whereas Goldmember goes completely off the rails. Michael Caine obviously misses his glory days as Britain's best, but Beyonce Knowles is a pleasant surprise, combining blaxploitation and sassy girl very very well. The script has the cringe worthy jokes that we all laugh at, but they're delivered in a way so they actually seem more cring worthy, but not funny.
Awash with cameo's (why Steven Speilberg, why?) from people that obviously had nothing better to do, this is a shameful entry to the otherwise side-splitting series.

The Goldmember guy is a really stupid character and the plot is not all that funny. This movie must have been thrown together in a hurry because I could have easily written a better script givin the success and the characters in the series.

1795517,5,B00006WUWP,"There's much more to this movie than might be seen by your average reviewer.  Yes, it repeats itself.  Yes, it uses obvious gags.  But, such is the spirit and style of the Austin Powers series.  Myers may reuse jokes, or use obvious gags.... but the point here is that he does them WELL.  He isn't repeating material from the first two movies because he's lazy.  Anyone who knows him will tell you very quickly that he'd never let that happen... he is doing is because its funny.  The opening is an obvious preparation for such total absurdity (and even a mockery of its own popularity) and all references to earlier movies are done with such self-consciousness that he obviously wants us to think about the previous films.  He isn't trying to make it seem new.
Its barely a shallow movie, either.  If anyone knows the background to the Austin Powers series, you've probably heard about Mike's amazing devotion to his father, Eric.  (note the name of the production company.... Eric's Boy)  And, what subject perpetuates Goldmember, in jest or in somber truth?  Family and fatherhood.  No, this isn't Shakespeare, but he is contemplating an issue in a special way that only a comedian can do.  It is as if he is laughing at the Mike Myers that made the first two films.  On that level of self-realization, the film is hardly shallow.  If comedies aren't your bag, or you have to cry all the way through something for it to say anything to you personally, that's fine, but lets remember that this is a comedy, folks.  Laugh a little.  It won't hurt.  I promise.
With that, I tip my hat to Austin, Dr. Evil, Fat, and Goldmember.  Mike is one of the most talented comedians of our era, and I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.",1036886400,,1739,4.548387096774194

And there are a few times where I couldn't help but feel like saying 'Ok you did that joke in the last two movies, c'mon now. Lets move things along. (see the fountain scene.)
  Lets see they did the 60's twice and now on the the 70's, what does this mean we should be prepared for Austin to go back to the 80's in a Terminator-like plot twist to try and stop Scott from ever being bored? Oh I'm getting ahead of myself, and giving away key plot points.
  In fairness, I did laugh, til my face hurt. Dr. Evil's rap was simply too much, and I loved the way Britney made fun of herself at the end. The jokes that were funny were very funny The mere thought of Michael Caine being in it was funny. After you saw the movie poster, it was all down hill from there. The Celebrity cameo's were pretty funny. I mean c'mon Tom Cruise and Gwenyth, no one saw that coming.

1795525,2,B00006WUWP,"It's sad, really. Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, was a great movie. Full of site gags, puns, and making full use of the clich&eacute;s of the spy genre, it was great.
Then, they made Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me. Which was good, but... The edge was gone. The jokes were cruder, and although I don't really mind toilet humor, it only gets you so far. It made many references to the prior film, but it only reminded you of how much better it was the first time. And Fat Bastard was one of the worst charecters ever to see the light of day.
Then, they made Austin Powers In Goldmember. The product I'm here to tell you about. I was excited when I saw the first trailer for it: a parody of the opening the original, with Mini-Austin Powers. Unfortunatly, most of the thinking done by the creators went into that trailer, at the expense of the movie.
How bad is it? Not only did they keep Fat Bastard, but they added another Myers charecter, Goldmember, that is somehow worse. And as for the toilet humor... If you like that sort of thing, at the exculsion of all other forms of jokes, you're in heaven. The rest of us are going to be dissapointed. There are some breaks-the star studded opening works well, and there are other clean laughs. But it's nothing to write home about. And, as before, every thing that hearkens back to a prior film is a shadow of its former self.

1795527,3,B00006WUWP,"So here it is the third instalment in one of the most popular and successful movie comedy franchises ever, Austin Powers in Goldmember, the follow up to the immensely popular and successful Spy Who Shagged Me. With Mike Myers reprising his role as writer/star, Beyonce Knowles as the new Powers girl and a cast which includes many of the biggest hitters in Hollywood, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Britney Spears, Danny Devito and Michael Caine (an inspired choice as Austin's father) this promised to be the funniest movie of the summer. However, rather than building upon The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember is instead a collection of hit and miss sketches, several of which are pale imitations of his last movie, loosely connected into some kind of story.
Opening with an action-packed pre-credit James Bond like sequence, with cameos from many of Hollywood's biggest stars gets the movie off to a funny if somewhat irrelevant start, which is great if you like movies within movies, not so great if you don't. From there we get back into the real action with Dr Evil and Myer's latest character Goldmember (a Dutchman with a gold penis and bad skin, which he likes to eat) plotting once more to take over the world. So far so good you might think but herein one of the problems lies: the character Goldmember just isn't funny and is positively poor next to all of Mike Myers other characters, including a disappointingly under-used and very flatulent Fat Bastard who makes a welcome but all too brief return. There are some very funny visual and verbal gags of course and a few clever scenes that retrace Austin Powers and Dr Evil's childhoods but all in all there are just as many hits as misses and too many scenes that are obvious retreads of the previous movies most successful gags, such as the use of silhouettes, telling Sean to zip-it and the Jay-Z ""It's A Hard Knock Life"" routine. Okay so these scenes are still, to an extent, funny but nowhere near as funny as the first time you saw them.
As for the cast, Myer's is his usual brilliant comedic self, it's just that his self-penned lines are not as good as before. Verne Troyer is once again splendid as Mini Me and Destiny's child's Beyonce Knowles makes a sassy and sexy Foxy Cleopatra, whilst Seth Green (sporting a receding hairline) is quite fabulous as Dr Evil's son Sean. However, the star of the show in my view, is Michael Caine, with a marvellous comedic performance as Austin's father Nigel, delightfully sending up his Harry Palmer persona from the 1960's movies that first made him a star.
  As for the movie as a whole, it is probably ideally suited to the DVD format more than any other movie out there, because on DVD you will be able to pick and choose which scenes you watch (and there are some very funny and very imaginative scenes). It is just that all n all you feel that you've seen it all before and seen it done better in the previous instalment. What is more the ending of the film suggests that not only is Mike Myers running out of new ideas for his spoof spy movies but that indeed it may be the end of this very profitable franchise. Still funny but not as funny as its predecessor: Three and a half stars.",1035849600,,3255,4.620034542314335

1795534,2,B00006WUWP,"This looks to be one of the first in a long line of sequels that are scheduled for this year and the next, with `Charlie's Angels 2', `The Matrix Reloaded', `Sky Kids 2' et al all finding their way into the cinemas soon.  Although inevitably some of these will be hugely anticipated and doubtless very good, there are always a few that will make its audience cringe.  This is one such movie.  The third in the `Austin Powers' trilogy finds Austin (Myers) teaming up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonc) and father Nigel Powers (Caine) to defeat not only Dr. Evil but also Goldmember, both of whom wish to flood the world.  But to be fair it's not really the plot that's the problem, it's the fact that the same gags that were used in the first two films are here tired and devoid of any life.
In taking on four roles, it's a little bit of overkill for Myers, who should have stuck to playing Austin and Dr. Evil rather than taking on any other roles.  Whilst there was admittedly some fun to be had from the first movie, especially for those well acquainted with the James Bond franchise, the constant sexual innuendoes that are thrown out one after the other are increasingly dull.  Very few of the jokes stick, although there is a great line from Caine when he asks one unfortunate man `Do you know how many anonymous henchmen I've knocked out over the years'?  You'd think that with such a fantastic supporting cast - Michael Caine, Seth Green, Vern Troyer and Beyonc are all brilliant - that there'd be something noteworthy in this movie, but it's actually incredibly boring.  True, it starts well with a host of cameo appearances - including Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears - that are very funny indeed, but it quickly goes downhill from there.  There's a fine line between affectionate parody and a desperate attempt at pandering to the audience's affection, and `Austin Powers' has crossed it.",1032307200,,1921,4.659763313609467

Old faviortes and new delights come into this film, I was laughing out loud non-stop throughout the whole movie, Yes I will admit this movie is not softcore humor, This has a lot of sex jokes and a lot of sick humor, So I would not recommend this to the kids, I am 19 and I loved it. This movie also includes a lot of Cameo's by Britany Spears, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and a lot more, If you don't like comedy's this movie will change your mind, It has good replay value, I have seen it twice and I still laugh just as hard as the first time.

1795537,3,B00006WUWP,"The third ""Austin"" is clearing showing us that this money-making fanchise is starting to suffer from overproduction: in other words, big money.  There is no inspired moments you found in the first Austin; there are recycled ideas here and there, like the projected shadow scenes, which are good proof that Mike Myers needs some rest to be creative again.  And about those cameos ... all I can say is they are enjoying the time.  But that's OK.  This film received mixed reviews simply because it is a mixed bag.  Some of you see the good side of it: the others bad.  Thet both are right in what they say.
The only thing I can really find recommedable, and everyone's opinions concur, is fresh presence of Beyonce Knowles, playing new character Foxxy Cleopatra.  Evidently a parody of Pam Grier's Foxy Brown and Tamara Dobson's Cleo Jones, she only should be given an unconditional praise which she very well deserves.  Sexy, witty, and most of all good at acting, Beyonce is the reason for me to refrain from hurling negative reviews to this rather tired film.  Watch her.  She is going to be a bigger thing if only she keeps on doing this great job.
There are some good things about the film.  One of them is, again, Verne Troyer's Mini-Me, who steals every scene he is in.  Michael Caine is pretty good, cutting self-parody figure of Harry Palmer-like spy, which was one of the original inspirations for creation of Austin.
The other regular cast is given a chance to make us laugh, and with moderate success, but overcrowded characters give them less chance to shine.  It is a great irony, but Mike Myers, who is given the biggest money in the production, is least funny in the film, playing unnecesarily four characters while few of them  function quite well.
About those cameo stars -- I say again they are enjoying the time, but I don't think all of them equally appeal to you.  (In fact, I thought it is kind of funny, but it shows the deplorable lack of creative mind in Hollywood.)  Anyway, my advice: Don't be late for the show, and if you miss the opening credits, you miss something you shouldn't.  The only exception I find really funny is uncredited Nethan Lane, playing dummy for Foxxy.  He shows he is a real artist even in this short time, with his talent.  The others, just showing up.  The differnce is too big to be ignored, and tells you the rela distinction between just being superstar and professional actor.
The film is just an OK one, but Beyonce raises it to a bit higher level.  But at the same time, Myers's uninspired jokes about sex and girls are just meant for undemanding children, and his gags about Dutch and Japanese people are just offensive, not because they are politically uncorrect, but because they are helplessly unfunny.  Wants to make a good laugh out of sumo wrestlers?  Go ahead, it's OK, as long as you make it funny.  As it is, you might as well wait for DVD.  That might explain too short cameo of Rob Lowe, too.",1030147200,,2962,4.574952561669829

If you do the opposite of what I have just told you, you will be sorely disappointed. You might still get a few laughs. As this had some truly funny momments that comedic genius Mike Myers has created.
It doesn't have the same spunk and originality that the first Austin Powers movie had, and is not nearly as funny. I did like Michael Caine's character, he plays Austin's often missing father, Nigel.  Fat Bastard pops back up to rear his ugly head. One of Destiny's child plays the female lead, and she is cute in her role as Foxxy Cleopatra.  Austin meets her back in the 70's when he goes back to rescue his dad from the villian, ""Goldmember"", also played by Myers.  I honestly didn't like this character. He isn't funny, and is not really all that evil, just annoying. Dr. Evil is a great character, and often I find myself laughing more at what he says than at what Austin says.

1795542,4,B00006WUWP,"In ""Austin Powers in Goldmember,"" Mike Myers reprises his role as the swinging British superspy Austin Powers. He also reprises the roles of Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, as well as creating a new character: the titular Goldmember, a Dutch villain with a rather unusual anatomical feature. Most of the cast from previous ""Austin"" films returns. Joining the cast is Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (whose name is an apparent homage to two ""blaxploitation"" movie heroines). Also on board is Michael Caine as Austin's father, Nigel.
""Goldmember"" continues the successful formula of the last two films: superspy action, musical numbers, outrageous sight gags, gross-out sex-and-toilet humor. There are some clever bits, such as a flashback sequence involving Austin and some other characters as youngsters at school. And Dr. Evil's submarine lair is a great visual device.
Knowles is an inspired addition to the cast as the sexy agent who promises that she's ""a whole lotta woman!"": she seems like she's really having fun with the role. Myers is likewise excellent in his quadruple role; I really could forget that it was him in all these roles, and enjoyed each one as an individual character. Myers has good chemistry with both Knowles and Caine. The returning Verne Troyer (as Mini-Me) is an impish delight.
I didn't think that ""Goldmember"" was quite as funny as the preceding Austin epic, but it is still a colorful and enjoyable film, and is further enhanced by a bunch of clever cameos (I won't spoil the many surprises by revealing them). If you're an ""Austin"" fan, I recommend it.",1029801600,,1583,5.022813688212928
1795543,4,B00006WUWP,"My twenty years old daughter and her boyfriend invited me to the movies with them to see the latest Austin Powers film.  I went, somewhat reluctantly, as it is not the film I would have chosen, even though I had previously seen the two other Austin Powers films and enjoyed them. Well, am I ever glad that I did! It was, without a doubt, the funniest Austin Powers film to date.
From the great opening scene to the surprise ending, replete with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, the Ozzie Osbourne Family, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, and John Travolta, the film is a laugh riot. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) still has his mojo amd, together with his gorgeous female sidekick de jour, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), sets out to rescue his father, Nigel (Michael Caine), from the evil clutches of the notorious Dutchman, Goldmember (Mike Meyers). To do so, they must go back in time to 1975, the era of disco fever.
Fan of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number Two (Robert Wagner), Scot Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Basil (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) will be happy to know that they are all back in this film. Mini-Me very nearly steals the show, and he does this without ever uttering a single word. Fred Savage joins the party as Number Three/The Mole and becomes a running sight gag throughout the film for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer.
The only problem in the film is with the character of Goldmember. He is the weak link, as he is simply gross and not particularly funny. What was Mike Myers thinking? Notwithstanding the fact that the title character is pretty much of a zero, however, the film is still hilarious, overall. The plot, what little there is, primarily exists to set up a lot of sight gags, send ups, and a number of very funny scenes. If, however, scatological humor offends your sensibilities, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are not easily offended by the crude and the lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.",1029801600,,2126,4.71505376344086
1795544,2,B00006WUWP,"Most ""three-quels"" don't turn out as good as the movies they followed, and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is no exception.  The movie has its funny moments, but it never gets rolling like the previous two.  Take the setting.  In ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"" Austin fast-forwarded from his own ""swinging"" '60s era into the 1990s, where he was hopelessly (and hillariously) out of style.  Then in ""The Spy That Shagged Me,"" he went back to the '60s.  In ""Goldmember,"" it's hard to follow what time Austin is in.  Even though his new love, Foxy Cleopatra, is from the '70s, ""Goldmember"" doesn't develop that time very well.
Another thing: what happened to Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me?"" Unlike Vanessa Kennsington, we never find out the fate of the diva from the second film.  I don't think Foxy Cleopatra was as good a love as Vanessa or Felicity.  The film should have brought other elements from the '70s besides Afros.
The appearances of other noted stars, like Tom Cruise, Steven Speilberg, and the Osbornes, were good touches.  However, they couldn't save the movie.  I hope Mike Myers doesn't make a fourth Austin Powers, because that one might be even worse than ""Goldmember.""",1029715200,,1233,4.941747572815534

Mini-Me is even more hilarious, especially in his rap sequence with Dr. Evil, and also being Mini-Austin.

1795547,4,B00006WUWP,"Fans at this site gave this film  bad reviews before it came out just because Beyonc Knowles plays the Powers girl. Yes she's the weakest of the girls in the Austin Powers movies but she's not terrible either, even was really bad she couldn't of brought down this hilarious laugh a minute sequel. Austin Powers: Goldmember is no doubt my favorite one. The Spy Who Shagged Me! was basically the first all over again with small new developments. This one however is totally it's own movie. It has hilarious cameos, funny twists and finally new villain in Goldmember. It's just a lot more fun than the last 2 I think. It just makes you actually roar with laughter and can't say the others did that for me.
  Mike Myers is the only comedian who can hold a candle to Eddie Murphy duel role wise. He's very convincing as every character he plays. Everyone he plays is just so different from the other and he pulls them off excellently. Heard this is the last but I really hope not, would love to see Myers create and play yet another new villain for a 4th outing.",1029628800,,1057,4.438144329896907

The plot moves so slowly and jerkily that Mike Myers' poorly thought-out comedy sequences seem like intermissions!  There were only about three people in the theater laughing at most jokes (one low-voltage fellow down front with that nerdy laugh--I wanted to kick him).  I only laughed twice (well, half-laughed).  The ""mole"" thing was inane (Fred Savage needs to salvage his career now) and the celebrity cameos were just a whiff of fragrance that slightly distracted us from the foul smell emanating from the screen.  This is the only movie I have -ever- walked out of, and I only wish I had done so sooner.  Fortunately Mike Myers does not have any of my money; ) as I was more than glad to give it to Mr. Diesel, who makes up for all the dreadful Bond films of late.

Mike Myers likes to appeal to the 13 yr old boy in all of us and he does this again with ""Goldmember"", the third installment in his Austin Powers series.  I think the other two were a little bit better than this one but I still think it was an enjoyable film.  If you wanna go out with some friends and just have some stupid laughs, then this is the film you should see.  I was hoping we would see more out Michael Caine but his part was still funny, none-the-less.  The cameos that start the film are funny and worth the admission.

Man, Austin Powers NEVER gets old to me! When this movie comes out I am definantly going to buy it! One thing that dissapoints me is that some people are giving this movie a low rating because they say it has to many of the same jokes.

No one can answer that but you.  Again, I do not try to write these reviews to try to get you to see the movie or agree with me.  I simply write these reviews because I enjoy to, and I hope they serve only to help you or give you an idea of what to expect.
...""Austin Powers: Goldmember,"" while maybe not having the greatest story in the world, made me laugh hard and loud.  That was all I was looking for in the first place.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.  I was afraid it was going to be too routine or similar to the other two.  Although I must say that the very first ""Austin Powers"" is the best out of all three, I found this one better and more funnier than the sequel.
Does it have a great story?  It's a story.  Not the greatest, but I DON'T CARE!  It made me laugh.
My one big complaint was that the new character, Goldmember, should've been incorporated into the movie more.  I think Myers missed an opportunity to really be creative with the new character, but makes the mistake of having him be very low key and not that important to the movie.
Of course, as always, Dr. Evil steals the show, and is one of my favorite characters to come out of a movie.  He is really funny in this one.  In fact, I think he might've been funnier in this one than the other two.  I'll have to watch the other two again before I decide to put that in stone, but I'm pretty sure that's how it went.
I do not want to explain the story or the funniest moments, because there ARE some surprises in the movie that I do not want to give out.  Especially the beginning.  If you already heard how the movie begins from someone, you were cheated.  Big time.
""Austin Powers: Goldmember"" did it's job.  It made me laugh and entertained the hell out of me.  That's all I was looking for, and nothing more.  Again, this is one that's getting mixed reviews.  So, it's kind of hard for anyone to tell you if this is one you should see or pass on.  Here's a good idea:  See ""Master of Disguise"" first.  I'm sure after you see how horrible and unfunny that movie is, you will go into this movie and thinking it's hillarious.  Hey, give it a shot.  I really did enjoy this movie, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of them if Myers can keep it up.  As long as there is a place for Dr. Evil, I will always be there.",1029196800,,2503,4.130705394190872
1795555,2,B00006WUWP,"What happened to the great Austin Powers. The first movie was so funny, so cutting edge, so wonderful, and even the sequel was pretty good, though I imagine Mini-Me was the saving grace there. But this movie was horrible. It's like Mike Myers was trying to mine all the money he could, but without taking the time to create a decent script. Austin is as irritating as always, and his new (ex-singer) sidekick is just a waste. Better to have brought back Heather Graham. The evil was sucked out of Dr. Evil, and not even Mini-Me was as funny as he had been before. Even Fat Bastard (though he got very little screen time) wasn't funny. The new villain, Goldmember, was poorly done, and it just seemed Myers wanted to play another role in the movie. Dr. Evil's henchmen got little screen time, which is a shame because Number 2 and Frau are quite funny. Seth Green reprised his role as Scott Evil, but not nearly as well done in either of the prequels, though his end scene wasn't bad. We got to meet Austin Powers' father (and see clips of Austin and Evil in 'prep' school), who is played by the not so fabulous Micheal Cain. And he was a total bore. Half the trouble with this film is that it was way too crowded. The same mistake the Batman franchise made. And the ending was wrapped up all very nicely, neatly, and way too cheesey. Not spoofing itself, just a poor attempt at scriptwriting. I was really dissapointed in this film. It had so much potential, but just like Myers' Wayne's World, he has tried to milk the cash cow for too much, too fast, and without a decent script. I will admit that it did have a few funny moments, but the last 20 minutes or so aren't worth sitting in your seat.",1029196800,,1697,4.3734177215189876

1795557,3,B00006WUWP,"""Goldmember"" earns a very generous rating of three stars from Yours Truly, a fan who couldn't get enough of the far superior first two Austin Powers films. After setting the box office on fire with 1999's ""The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" Mike Myers returns in ""Goldmember,"" which is the most confident and flashy of the three films. It also happens to be the weakest. The plot is simple: a flesh-eating Dutch agent of Dr. Evil named Goldmember has kidnapped Austin Powers's dad. So, Austin must travel back to 1975 to rescue him. While the film features impressive performances from Michael Caine as Austin's dad and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (an obvious nod to the Pam Grier/Tamara Dobson blaxploitation films of the 1970s), ""Goldmember"" has a worn-out, ""been there, seen that"" feel to it. Toilet and anatomy jokes abound, which are fine in moderation, but they wear out their welcome real fast. Plus the Goldmember character (played by Myers) isn't very interesting as a villan. But what does work is the string of cameos (none of which I will reveal), particulary during the first ten minutes. We also get some clever references of films from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" to ""Yentyl."" And while I was expecting to trash Beyonce in her silver screen debut, she actually gives her role a welcome dose of sass and spark as Austin's sidekick Foxxy. However, she's not really required to do much more than look fabulous, sport her abs, and recite one-liners from Blaxploitation films. I walked into the theatre with high expectations of ""Goldmember,"" which were sadly not met due to the second-rate quality of the film's material.

At work we all talk about the movie and try to be P/C while doing so. Anyone who loved the first two will also love this one. I hope that Mike keeps making these great films. The only thing I would remove is the inclusion of emotional drama and I would include more of the prior cast.

1795559,5,B00006WUWP,"""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is yet another successful installment in Mike Myer's spy-spoof series.  The great thing is that Myer's has definitely found that successful comedy formula for Power's that fans of the series should enjoy.  The one bad thing about this film though is that the ending definitely rocks the boat to the point where you leave the film wondering, ""Gee, where are they going with this???""
THE STORY:
Austin travels through time and around the globe searching for his missing father, Nigel while finding a new sexy sidekick, Foxy Cleopatra (Destiny's Child's Beyonce Knowles) and taking on the usual horde of bad guys (Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard and new villain, gilded gross-out Dutchman Goldmember).
THE COOL THINGS:
If there's one thing you can say about the movie it is that it is ""formulaic.""  It contains all the classic Austin ""features"" ie - sexual double entendres, sexually suggestive fancy editing, humorous editing, funny ""shadow shows,"" funny Dr. Evil soliloquies, star-studded cameos (even more than ever in this one!!!) etc.  In all, it's what you'd expect from a Powers movie and it works.  It's just as funny (if not more so) than the previous installments.
THE CRITICISM:
While the film is just as funny than previous installments, some may criticize though that some of it may be getting old, which in some parts it does feel that way (ie - the edited scene where they spew out several synonyms for a ""taboo"" word).  Also, this film is definitely a departure from previous outings as the plot definitely does reveal a pretty shocking revelation about everyone's favorite ""Evil"" genius.  (Think Star Wars).  Like I mentioned earlier, you definitely need to wonder where this series is headed in future installments.  Also, the Goldmember character to me is just worthless.  While somewhat funny (Myer's is an AWESOME performer to nail down soooo many diverse roles) the character is more gross than anything else and I for one could've done without him...
In all though, fans and movie lovers alike should be pleased and rolling around happily during this flick.
BEST SCENES:
1. The jailhouse music video (which you've probably seen all over E!, the Internet, Entertainment Tonight, etc.
2. Fun with subtitles.
3. The Japanese building fight scene
4. Fun with shadows
THE VERDICT:
Overall, if you are an Austin fan or if you are in need of a really good laugh, you can't go wrong with ""Austin Powers in Goldmember.""
Highly Recommended",1028851200,,2478,5.007299270072993
1795560,1,B00006WUWP,"As a huge fan of the first Austin Powers film and someone who was somewhat amused (though disappointed) in the second film, I cringed with embarassment in watching what will hopefully be the final installment in this tired series.
This is a movie that I desperately wanted to like because I thought the first film was brilliant and Mike Myers seems like a genuinely nice guy.
But this movie is just not funny.
I got that sense right after the opening cameos, about five minutes into the film, when Austin mugs into the camera. This is the kind of desperate technique used by a character whose hoping to get by on charm alone.
But someone can only say ""Yeah, baby"" so many times. Austin passed that point in the second film, and despite being the title character, he has absolutely no humor value anymore.
Dr. Evil, who was funny in the second film, meets his comic demise early in this film, when he banters with Scott, a take on the ""Shhh"" and ""Zip it"" routines from the first two films.
Fat Bastard was gross, not funny, in the second film. This time he followed the same formula, but kicked in an insulting product plug to boot.
The Goldmember character is so dull he doesn't even warrant description, but I'll provide one anyway. His big schtick is that he eats his own peeled-off, dead skin and he's really flexible. Once again, I'm not sure how this passes for humor.
Foxy Cleopatra sucks. Sorry.
The bottom line is that Myers and New Line knew they had a cash cow on their hands, so no real effort was put into this film at all, aside from the cross-promotional efforts with Taco Bell and Subway. They just pieced a bunch of recycled celluloid together, threw it on the projectors and reeled in your eight bucks.
As witnessed with Wayne's World 2, Myers can't sustain any momentum for his unique characters past 90 minutes. To be fair, not too many comedic actors can. If he comes out with something new and fresh, I'm there. But as long as he continues to bang out hack-job scripts for big-time paychecks, I'll be perfectly comfortable spending my money elsewhere.",1028851200,,2072,4.587601078167116

The cameos are hilarious and Goldmember is a decent villian.
My only complaints?  Beyonce and the ending.  The ending makes me wonder if there can be another sequel and Beyonce isn't given much of a character to play.  Foxxy is outshadowed by about everyone else and this really makes me wonder what happened to Felcity Shagwell.
Either way, this movie is still very funny and I can highly recommend it.",1028851200,,629,4.434782608695652
1795562,4,B00006WUWP,"Austin Powers in Goldmember is the much anticipated 3rd and final installement to the Austin Powers series, which could now be considered legendary. Goldmember is a comedy, but it also reveals many secrets of the last 2 Austin's, like Austin and Dr. Evil's pasts (you might be suprised by the truth). On the laughable side, Minime turns good, Scott turns evil, Britney Spears has bullets shooting out of her [breasts], The Osbournes pop up in a scene, and anything else you could imagine in an Austin Powers movie. But, there is a little problem. I don't know if it's just me, but Austin's magic is fading. It's not as funny as it used to be and a lot of the jokes have already been used in previous movies.

1795565,4,B00006WUWP,"If the outrageous prologue featuring a cluster of stellar cameos in their goofiest doesn't impress as a golden moment then the third installment in this blockbuster franchise is clearly out of your league.
You probably wouldn't even want to venture into the plot by then. Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and his Mini Me (Verne Troyer) clone has escaped from prison and kidnapped the cryogenically-revived spy's father, Nigel Powers (Michael Caine). Our hero England's most esteemed spy is sent in his purple pimpmobile to 1975 to thwart a plot to submerge the world by hitting the polar cap with a missile. Austin has to rescue his father and battle a new villain Goldmember who now collaborates with the usual Evil cohorts - No. 2 (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Stering) led by Dr. Evil and his son Scott Evil (Seth Green).
Rest assured Austin still keeps his mojo going. His former shag honey detective Foxxy Cleopatra is now undercover as a roller disco dancer. Beyonce Knowles of Destiny Child's fame kicks off her debut with sass and mighty afros. No less brilliant in the casting is Michael Caines as Austin's flirtatious daddy. It couldn't be more apt when Caine's Harry Palmer sleuth from Iprcress files inspired the Powers creation.
As the genesis for Austin Powers in Goldmember, Mike Myers stamps his presence all around as the freak Goldmember, the grossly-corpulent Scottish bagpiper Fat Bastard and Evil. It retains the good stuff and packs it to saturation point and even to the extent of being cluttered. The comedy is a hoot with riotous gags, spoofs of Singing in the Rain, Mission-impossible, Britpop and rap-videos and blatantly crude in its sex-themed jokes as well as obscene sequences of poop-and-pee.
It is rowdy and infantile but as usual vulgarly exuberant for Myer's visceral performance and his sly parody. Goldmember, in all seriousness beckons you not to be. While we miss the simpler wits in its predecessor, Goldmember still swings as a solid-gold entertainment.",1028764800,,1993,5.060790273556231
1795566,4,B00006WUWP,"By now, everyone and their dog seems to have weighed in on whether they liked the scattalogical jokes in ""Goldmember.""  All I can say is, if you liked the first two Austin Powers movies and laughed at the many jokes about male anatomy, female anatomy and bodily functions, you will find more laughs here.  If you found these objectionable, best go check out the latest ""Disney"" release.
What I enjoyed--and something no reviews I've seen so far seem to have picked up on--were the many movies that ""Goldmember"" either overtly references or subtly satirizes.  Some are fairly obvious, such as the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" CB reference just before a chase scene.  Only after I left the theater, did I realize how many other movies were ""quoted"" in some way:  The sudden breaking into sappy songs parodies ""Moulin Rouge.""  There's a ""Harry Potter""-esque British prep school flashback with young Austin and young Dr. Evil.  The movie-within-a-movie opening scene spoofing how Hollywood would portray Austin Powers made me think of ""The Player"" (where a fictional movie that was pitched as needing unknowns--""no stars""--and a tragic ending winds up with Bruce Willis rescuing Julie Roberts for a happy ending).
Best of all, the father-son relationship between Myers and Michael Caine (who portrays Austin's sophisticated special agent father) is reminiscent of the delightful chemistry and needling between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.""
Caine is terrific as Austin's debonnaire father whose kidnapping prompts Austin to time travel back to the 1970s to rescue him.  Setting ""Goldmember"" in the glitzy disco era helps keep the material fresh--and give Austin a reason to drive a pimp mobile and dress like Huggy Bear.
Although I wasn't impressed with her in the previews, Beyonce Knowles' street-smart undercover agent Foxxy Cleopatra may be my favorite sidekick yet.  Her outrageous afro (which mysteriously transforms into a Charlie's Angel's style flip in one '70s scene and instantly springs back to its regular mass after a swim) provides a recurring sight gag that Austin's teeth did in the first movie.
Generally, in the sight gag department, ""Goldmember"" doesn't come up with much new, but it does a great job recycling the best of the first two movies.  Making encores are a sustained urination scene, a hilarious and even lewder shadows scene, and an unidentified flying object that, this time, looks like it needs a bra (prompting another series of breast euphemisms).  Myers apparently couldn't come up with fresh ideas for one of my favorite Powers' segments--the hidden nudity.  The new gag this time around--aside from numerous unfunny references to Goldmember's gold ""member""--are the obscured subtitles that sound dirty until something shifts and the rest of the white-subtitled sentence becomes readable against a dark background.
As for plot, well, there isn't much.  Dr. Evil is trying to extort a ransom out of the equivalent of the United Nations (the name escapes me) by crashing a gold meteor into the world.  Austin must save the day--again.
The numerous cameos (I won't spoil the surprise) and the movie spoofs make this much more than another bathroom-humor movie.",1028678400,,3226,5.190751445086705

We get the same old catch-phrases thrown at us again and again.  If this doesn't bother you - and you just love Austin to death, then by all means see this movie.
For me, it's gotten really old.  The characters seem lost for anything original to do.  The cameos in the movie are entertaining, and I do wonder if this movie would have suffered without them.  AP3 is not a horrible movie by any means.  I found myself laughing at times, but the true laughs are few and far between.

1795569,5,B00006WUWP,"Considering how much I really despise Beyonces group Destinys Child I kept my expectations for this movie relatively low. I was so sick and tired of hearing that strongly annoying voice on the radio and people shoving that DC krap in my face.
However my expectations were completely blown away and Goldmember turned out to be my favorite of the Austin Powers saga.
The jokes that dominated the first two flicks are continued in the third installment of the bunch. Austin Powers is one a mission to stop a crazed man from using a magnetic beam to cause an giant asteroid to collide with earth. Plus Austin has to rescue his long lost father by the name of Nigel Powers.
My favorite part was where Austin Powers met Britney Spears in the awful Boyz video when it turns out that the Britney in the movie was actually a fembot. I literally laughed when I saw the fembot blow up.
While the female charachter Foxy Cleopatra did get on my nerves at the beginning I must say she turned out much better than I thought. While I don't have much respect for Beyonce Knowles in terms of music she could gain my respect in terms of being an actress.
So far one of the best theatrical releases of 2002! I'm looking forward to the fourth installment whenever that comes out.",1028505600,,1258,4.497816593886463
1795570,2,B00006WUWP,"I saw this movie at a Matinee showing. I am happy I only spent [price] as opposed to [price]. I did not feel ripped off but I went into the theater with high expectations (I laughed so much during AP2) to bust a gut. I beleive AP2 is by far the funniest in the series. AP1 was funny the first time I saw it, but now I get bored watching it. AP3,in my opinion, tries too hard to use recycled jokes from the previous movies. I was surprised after about 30 minutes into the film that I was not into hysterics. AP2 had tears running down my face by this point. However, the rest of the audience never rolled into peals of laughter either. I noticed more people were making sounds of disgust. I must tell you that I love gross-out humor. AP3 has plenty of gross things but they are overused. Goldmember, the ""dermivore,"" is kind of boring, they should have left the scheme plotting to Dr. Evil. There is a fellow with a mole that is the [brunt] of jokes throughout the film. I must be honest. The joke was not funny the first time, and it sure as hell was not funny the 3,000th time. I wanted to scream when they kept using this joke. Mini Me was funny as always. In fact the Mini Me character was a great addition to the evil side. Scott Evil needed more time as well, and his usurping the Evil Empire at the end seemed hokey and gave the franchise a shaky future. After all, Dr. Evil is the perfect villian. Another point that was stupid were the Asian twins who desire Austin powers. They make a joke with their names, ""Phook-mi"" and ""Phook-yu."" Okay, I thought that was stupid and not especially funny, then Austin pulls out a dream list referring to sex with ""Japanese twins."" Japanese? Those are Chinese names. That is insulting to my intelligence. Also, the radar screen joke is recycled here with  members of the female anatomy. In AP2 the joke was funny but now in its new incarnation it was old and (yawn) not funny. I also took issue to Britney Spears appearing in this film. I find her especially annoying with no real talent and a high degree of ""plasticity"" in her body and personality. I hate her Pepsi Commercials and have to see them whenever I watch the Simpsons. I would like to enjoy some form of media without seeing her. In my opinion, in 25 years nobody will care about her. I also do not understand the appeal of Tom Cruise. I have found him annoying since his ""Maverick"" role in Top Gun.
So what did I find funny? Mini-me is always hilarious as are Number 2 and Scott Evil. There is a great moment where Ausitn gives Mini the boot. The female sidekick, Foxxy Cleopatra is not bad and enjoyable to look at. The ""Preparation H"" plan of world domination was pretty funny as well. Fat Bastard did not get enough time in this movie. He has enormous humor potential. Danny DeVito's cameo as Mini-Me was one of the times I really laughed.

1795574,3,B00006WUWP,"The well has run dry.  Myers and crew have milked all they can out of the Austin Powers franchise, and it shows in this movie.  There are a few clever moments here and there, but really only one or two genuine bellylaughs in the whole film.
The HEAVY and OBVIOUS product placement bits (Taco Bell, Pepsi) cheapen the movie.  The numerous and extended musical sequences serve mainly as time-fillers - there isn't a great deal of story in this movie.  The ""mole"" gag falls flat, and the new villain Goldmember isn't given a whole lot to do.
The celebrity cameos are a fun diversion, but might have been more fun in the second movie.  By this time this law-of-diminishing-returns third movie came out, the jokes were mostly already played out, so the celebrity cameos seem more like desperate stunt-casting to distract from a rather feeble storyline and lack of original humor.
I can't imagine that there would be a fourth AP movie (nor should there be a fourth Indiana Jones movie -- are you listening, Steven?).
Sorely missed in ""Goldmember"" -- Rob Lowe and Will Farrell.  Lowe's scenes were cut (if they were ever even shot) and Farrell wasn't invited.
""Goldmember"" has a somewhat clever and entertaining opening sequence, then it drags for quite a bit.  Then it drags some more.  A laugh here and there, then some more drag.  But it will make money, and the DVD release will surely be feature-packed and just in time for Christmas.
""Goldmember"" is the sloppiest and least satisfying of the three.

The film is funny but not half as funny as it's predecessor The Spy who Shagged Me or a tenth as funny as the original. Still, Mike Myers is a funny man with great comedic instincts. In addition to his gaggle of demented characters (Dr. Evil ...), Myers adds Goldmember to the list. Goldmember is a dutch hedonist from the '70's who likes roller skating and eating his own peeling skin but loves gold. Myers as always is at his best when running wild as these crazy alter-ego's. Seth Green's Scott Evil character gets less screen time in Goldmember but he is much more effective. If there is another Austin Powers, there is no doubt that Green's role will be expanded. I will say this, Beyonc Knowles is by far the hottest chick that Myers has used in these films. When she's on the screen you can't take you're eyes off of her. She also does a good job of acting(but really who cares!). Watching Goldmember as a fan of the series and Myers, the laughs are beginning to get strained which is sad because the original was so inspired. Anyway, if you're a fan go see it but don't expect anything more than a re-hash of the first two movies. Recommended for hard-core fans only.",1028332800,,1247,4.426086956521739

Expect Mike Meyers to have Dr. Evil do mostly improv-type material in the movie, but don't expect the shtick to work quite as well here as it has in the previous outings. Sadly, the title character didn't seem to add that much to the mix, aside from his ersatz Dutch accent, double-jointed hips, and skin condition. And you should especially expect several celebrity cameos, a few recycled gags that for the most part kinda work the second time `round, and a twisted & hilariously-implausible revelation regarding Austin and Dr. Evil at the climax.

1795579,2,B00006WUWP,"Dear Mike,
As a fellow survivor of suburban Toronto (you grew up in Scarborough, while I spent my formative years in Thornhill), I feel like I can say this to you with impunity:
STOP MAKING AUSTIN POWERS MOVIES.
I admit, I wasn't bowled over by ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"".  It made me laugh more than most contemporary comedies, but it always felt completely disposable.  After the ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", I felt annoyed that so many of the same jokes had been recycled.  Now, you've gone and done it again with ""Goldmember"".  Here, jokes that proved popular in the first two movies are given a third turn through the ringer, and the results, for the most part, are uncomfortable and undignified.  To your credit, you recognize that the same turf is being covered, but the references you make to this self-awareness come across more like excuses than meta-humour.  Example: The third entry into the Zip-it/Pshhh canon was totally incomprehensible.  What exactly was this little scene about?  Scott's realization that he's about to go down the same path for the third time -- along with his resulting ennui -- doesn't quite save the scene like you'd like it; rather, it should have served as a warning call to you, the screenwriter, that the joke is tired and maybe you should just let it sleep.  Or, better yet, pull the plug.  The second moment of self-awareness, which contains one of the film's many celebrity cameos, felt tacked on and pointless.  Thankfully, as the story gets revved up, and the demand on your audience's attention is at a premium, you give up this practice.
Which is not to say that the story was at all comprehensible, even with an attentive audience.  One scene followed another without any notion of coherence.  From what I can tell, the story revolved around Austin having to save his father from an evil villain from the 1970's who was brought back to the year 2002 by another evil villain whose evil scheme is foiled and is sent to jail where he hatches an escape plan to... ugh!  I'm getting a headache.  If it were at all worthwhile trying to extract some logic from this tangled mess, then I'd give it the college try.  But I suspect that would be an exercise in futility.
I still haven't talked about your performance in the film, Mike.  Or, should I say, performances.  This whole multiple-role-playing schizophrenic acting style you've latched on to is just fine.  Alec Guinness did it.  Peter Sellers (one of your idols, I know) did it.  Even fellow SNL-alum Eddie Murphy has done it.  All with unquestioned success.  Mike, you have as much talent for characterization as any of these men, and I'm glad that you've found a vehicle for your talents.  The problem here is that what started as just two characters, and then three, has now become four.  You're spreading yourself way too thin, Mike.  You've left no room for the rest of your cast to shine.  I can't imagine why Robert Wagner or Mindy Sterling or Michael York bothered to show up for this film.  Besides loyalty, that is.  You give them nothing to do!  And what do you replace their screen time with?  The inane and idiotic title character.  Goldmember the man -- like ""Goldmember"" the movie -- has precious few funny moments.  The rest of his time on screen is humiliating: to the performers who must share the screen with him, to the audience who paid to watch this drivel, and to you, Mike, for debasing yourself.  When it comes to Austin himself -- who I always felt was one of the weaker characters in the series -- I ask you, Mike, please: TONE IT DOWN A SHADE!  Not every line reading needs to be punctuated with a purr or a ""Yeah, baby!""  You're too smart to be this obnoxious.
(Here's where I throw in a compliment: Dr. Evil is, as always, a hilarious creation.  Too bad he's almost non-existent here.  There.  Palette cleansed.  Now, back to the vitriol.)
Despite all evidence to the contrary, there are other people in ""Goldmember""s cast besides you, Mike.  Let's talk about them for a while.
The usual suspects (Wagner, York, Sterling, Troyer, Seth Green) are, as usual, quite suspect.  Green, to his credit, does not embarrass himself.  Which I can't say about the two top-billed newcomers.
Michael Caine is the perfect choice to play Austin's father.  Here he's like Alfie after an espresso binge, all manic motion and wild shenanigans.  But Caine doesn't emerge unscathed from this mess.  He's a man who has two Oscars and once shared equal billing with Sir Laurence Olivier... but you make him act a particularly humiliating scene with Verne Troyer!  Is this his karmic retribution for having appeared in ""Jaws: The Revenge""?  Didn't the Steven Seagal movie he made take care of that?
Beyonce Knowles was in this movie.  I think.  She says ""Shazam"" a couple of times.  And she kept asking, ""What's happening?""  And I think at one point she even said, ""Shut your mouth"".  Other than that, it was a totally unmemorable performance.  I thought the blandness that Heather Graham showed in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" could not be topped (or, bottomed), but Beyonce found a new low.  Still, she looks good in a cut off shirt, so that's at least one point in her favour.
In closing, let me just say this, Mike: You've made the most cynical movie of the year.  It pains me to say this, because in interviews you come across as an intelligent, creative, dignified man, with a lust for comedy and a yearning to create something new and different.  Time to put the old International Man of Mystery back in deep freeze, get back to the drawing board, and think up something new.
A once and future fan,
Mike",1028246400,,5627,4.678899082568807
1795580,4,B00006WUWP,This was just as good as the other two. There are some thrills in the movie. Like making a movie about Austin's life. I like the part where it shows Danny DeVito playing Mini-Me. This was a hysterical movie!,1028246400,,207,4.333333333333333

1795582,4,B00006WUWP,"Once again, we are taken on another adventure with the hygiene challeneged super spy Austin Powers. Does Austin still have his mojo?. You bet. Is it still as potent?. Not as much. Mike Myers is back bringing his characters to the big screen. The plot, as expected, is second or third to the comedic chaos and characters that are all over this movie. Dr. Evil is back with another masterful plan to destroy the world. This time, it involves a new arch nemesis. A dutch, disco loving, dry skin peeling(and eating),rollerskating loony named Goldmember. Why is he named Goldmember?. I'm sure you can all guess why. This new character is rather odd and creepy. He is easily Myers' weakest creation so far. He doesn't hit the funny bone the right way like all of the others. A big hype for the character, but a total let down. It could of been better. Dr. Evil is still the best of the bunch. He gets the best parts. No matter what, Dr. Evil always comes thru. Fat Bastard pops up in very funny moments. He is used more sparingly here, and that might be a good thing. Myers is a tremendously talented performer. Just like Eddie Murphy in the ""Nutty Professor"" movies, he really brings his characters to life with their own character and individuality and tone. He is great. Michael Caine is also on hand here as Austin's father, Nigel Powers. Caine is good(Of course), but he felt like he was a bit underused. You'd think they'd give a legendary, Oscar winning star something juicier. There was so much potential there for something more, but they didn't use it. Then there is Beyonce Knowles. I adore her. She is sweet and beautiful. Is she an actress?. She could be, but this isn't the role that would show it. She is spicy and sexy as Foxy Cleopatra, and that is pretty much all you need to be in a role like this. She fits it well. She is alluring and charismatic, but only time will tell if she actually has the acting chops. The regulars all return here too. Seth Green as Scott, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Mindy Sterling as Frau, and Michael York as Basil Exposition. Former ""Wonder Years"" star Fred Savage has a role too. There are a number of cameos here. We are talking BIG star cameos. All of the cameos are great and used to the fullest potential. Myers knows they need to be quick and funny, and quick and funny they are. I also know that a lot of people will probably cheer when Britney Spears(spoiler)blows up. Oops. Should I of let that slip?. There is no doubt that this movie goes into juvenile, frat house humor that includes human excrement and the like, but that isn't always a bad thing. Potty humor can be real bad, but this is funny potty humor. It's not all like that tho. When the movie and it's jokes and sight gags are hitting on all cylinders, it's great and hysterical. When it fizzles, it is slightly uncomfortable, but it moves right along into something good and all is forgotten. Austin Powers is still one of the best comedic creations to come out of Hollywood in a long time. This isn't rocket science. These movies have their pattern and you know what to expect when you go in. If you hate it, don't go and then bash it. Is this the best Austin Powrs movie as has been stated?. No. It fits just fine with the previous two, but I still prefer those before this one. Austin has become pretty routine because we know his schtick. That lessens the effect a bit, but it doesn't hurt the fun times this movie brings. Not one bit. Yeah baby!!.",1028160000,,3492,4.4492979719188765
1795583,5,B00006WUWP,"Before I start to review ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"", let's remember what the first two are like. Okay, the first one is... well, it's the original! You just can't compare to that. Very funny... 5 stars.
The second one wasn't as good AT ALL. It had Fat Bastard, who (I'm sorry) I just don't find very funny. He's more disgusting than anything. Also, it had Heather Graham who was terrible. Mike Myers was funny as usual as Dr. Evil and Austin Powers.
And then there were 3! ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" was released and it was FUNNY! It was different from the other two, maybe it's because more was going on. Also, it showed Dr. Evil alot more which is a good thing. Beyon'ce was better than I thought she would be and alot of the grossness from the previous movie was gone. There were alot of hilarious scenes, such as the beginning with Tom Cruise and Gwenyth Paltrow and the Dr. Evil rap while he's in jail. Seth Green (Scott Evil) wasn't in the movie as much as I'd hoped, but oh well. And also, there's a really weird, messed up twist at the end of the movie! I can't say what it is.... but it's cool! I can't figure out if I like ""International man of mystery"" or this one more! So, go see this right away!",1028160000,,1215,4.310043668122271
1795584,4,B00006WUWP,"Wasn't too much of a fan of the first movie, but nonetheless i laughed alot during it.  The sequel, however, knocked me out because it was so much better than the original.  So, when i first heard that they were going to make a third movie, i was ready.  However, when i saw the first trailer with the mini-me of Austin dancing in the street, i was disappointed.  I was hopping that what i was saw in that trailer was NOTHING like what was going to be in the movie.  Then, i began seeing the tv trailers and began to think that it was going to be decent.  When i finally walked out of the crowded theater that friday night that it opened, i couldn't stop laughing.
Of course, the big scene in the movie is the first 5 minutes.  I won't say anything, but just make sure you get there to see it.  It's hilarious.  After that, it's still a non-stop laugh riot until the end credits, which also contain extra scenes, so stick around for those.  Dr. Evil steals the movie, in my opinion.  He stole the show in the second movie and did so again in the third.  He's the best part of the movie.
The only reason i'm giving this movie four stars instead of five is because of three things: Beyonce Knowles, the character of ""Goldmember"" and the ending.  I'm not going to ruin the ending, but when you see it, i think you'll be disapointed.  It makes you wonder what a FOURTH movie would be like if all the characters stayed they way they are at the end.
Beyonce is just too over the top and never likeable.  Sure, she's hot and she can sing, but just because she did some MTV made-for-tv movie doesn't mean she will work out in a big-budget Hollywood movie.  Also, the title character is plain dumb and sometimes disgusting.  He has a habit of eating the dead skin that falls off of him.  The only thing that saves that joke is how Dr. Evil reacts to it.
Watch out for cameos by some famous people: Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Gwenyth Paltrow, Katie Couric and even Fred Savage, who had more of an extended-cameo.",1028160000,,2030,4.311345646437995
1795585,2,B00006WUWP,"Mike Myers can't seem to restrain himself at this point.  The first Austin Powers was a funny send-up of the 1960's espionage subgenre, and also turned into a surprise hit at the box office; the second film retained some of that parody, but showed a dive into blue humor and seemingly endless song-and-dance numbers...once again, the movie does well at the box office.
And now we have ""Goldmember,"" a comedy that actually pulls off the impossible by being the first PG-13 rated movie to outdo the likes of ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""South Park"" as far as gross-out humor is concerned.  For this film, Myers' mind seems to be swimming in the toilet of demographics and profits, and even though I laughed a lot, I can't help but imagine how simple it must be to take that route, and write as many bodily-function jokes into a 90-minute script as possible.  That's certainly what sells in this country, but whatever happened to subtlety?
I think Myers' key problem is his cliched characters.  While the vile Fat Bastard and Goldmember have some randomly funny moments, they wear out their welcome quickly because they're so obnoxious and insist on upstaging everyone else on-screen (another unsubtle sign of Myers' own self-indulgence?).  On the other end of the spectrum, Michael Caine seems to be playing himself with a snaggle tooth, and doesn't add much to the film.
There are some funny moments that don't revolve around wet farts, though: the send-up of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (w/Dr. Evil as Hannibal Lechter) had me laughing, as did the development of Mini-Me's character; the flashback to Austin and Dr. Evil as school students was well-done, as was the prison-yard dance number of ""Hard Knock Life.""  Unfortunately, Seth Green, who's probably the funniest aspect of all these films, is given little screen time, but might redeem ""Austin Powers 4"" if he takes over the family business (*wink wink*).
But ""Goldmember,"" for the most part, isn't even inspired idiocy in the vein of, say, ""Dumb and Dumber.""  It's just a constant barrage of low-intellect, childish humor that actually manages to be more offensive and crude than most R-rated movies.  ...",1028160000,,2168,4.953168044077135

This movie could be so much better if not for the obsession with juvenile jokes that are beaten to death over and over.

1795589,5,B00006WUWP,"Well what can I say..firstly I'll get the bad points out of the way..this film is not as good as The Spy Who Shagged me and the ending is a little disapointing.
Ok, now we have the bad point out the way, heres a list of the good points..
This film is absolutely hilarious!  As a very big fan of the series, I was hoping that this film wouldn't bring the quality of it down..and it hasn't.  Although not as good as the previous film, it is, in my opinion, better than the first film.  And the cameos..wow!  Tom Cruise, Gwynith Paltroe, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Danny DeVito, Briteny Spears, Steven Spielberg..they all make a brief appearence at the begining of the film.  Mike Myers is a comedy genius, he is absolutely brilliant as Austin, Goldmember and Fat Basterd, and perfect at Dr Evil.  If you enjoyed the previous films, you simply have to see this film, if you didn't like the previous films, it is unlikely that this one will win you over.  If you havn't seen the previous films..for gods sake, watch them!  This is my personal favirote film series (Apart from maybe the Bond series) and is a worthy contender as best comedy films of all time.",1028073600,,1156,4.4714285714285715
1795590,5,B00006WUWP,"Goldmember was better then the previous two! Really. Mike Meyers did an incredible job writing and producing this film and Jay Roach is back directing. This movie lets nothing be untouched by sarcasm and humor. All the old gags are back and all the old expectation of Dr. Evil and his plots and Austin Powers and his Mojo - have all returned. What's so cool about a fun movie like this is that you come out of the theatre imitating all the characters and quoting the dialogue. That's the sign of good movie - and it makes you laugh!
The full cast is back Michael York is the incredibly nieve Basil. Seth Green the notoriously jealous son of Dr. Evil. Robert Wagner as the incredible #2 and even the fabulous Frau is back too! Oh, and Mini Me goes through some surprising and hysterical changes
The story is silly and the plot predictable but the way they go through the story and all the sight gags There is visual humor, sight gags, puns and even quips and quibbles that I know I missed because I was laughing so hard. The new twist is that Austin Powers now has another plot to foil by Dr. Evil except this time it is complicated by his father, Nigel. This role was amazingly performed by the genius of Mr. Michael Caine.
Also Mike Meyers is now playing four roles in this movie - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat B. and now Goldmember.
Now lets talk about Guest appearances - Gwenyth Paltrow, Danny Devito, Kevin Spacey, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears and Tom Cruise. How's that for a starter...and that's in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Also John Travolta came along for the ride. Mike Meyers did an incredible job getting everyone together and I pleased to see all these Hollywood biggies also have a sense of humor about themselves.
The music is always classic the opening titles are amazing, the cars and costumes are brilliant and the movie is just as fun as it gets. I can't wait for the DVD on this one! 7-30-02",1027987200,,1925,4.471590909090909

I love Mike Myers. I think he's one of the funniest, most inventive guys ever. The first two Austin Powers movies were really entertaining, even if the second one had moments of toilet humor. The first half of this third movie in series is just great; it's got a terrific opening sequence with a movie about the movie. There's the introduction of Goldmember, Mike's latest lunatic character creation who is hilarious, quoting lyrics and, in asides, naming the songs they're from. Beyonce is gorgeous--a perfect James Bond female; and the usual crew is on hand. Dr. Evil carrying Mini-me like a new mother makes a terrific first appearance. In other words, all the stuff we love about the Powers movies is there.
Then comes the second half and we get endless toilet humor. I noticed all the little boys in the audience howling happily, just loving every bodily-function joke. But the adults were groaning with dismay, even disgust, at the material. The movie sputters to an end, then partly redeems itself with out-takes during the end credits.
If you loved the first two movies, go see this one with lowered expectations. That said, it's worth seeing just for the great first half.",1027987200,,1233,4.766355140186916

Goldmember is by far the best of the three Austin Powers movies.  The jokes are better, the timing is better, the performances are more on target. This movie does everything right.  This is Austin Powers on magic mushrooms, a freeflowing trip with no holds barred.  The fact that everyone was having a great time making this movie is apparent from the very beginning. Rather than dissect the movie and tell you about what works (most of it) and what doesn't (very little), just see it.  Of course, if double entendres offend you, or if you can't take bathroom humor, stay home.  Myers can't resist a little gutter humor, but it works here.

  That Being said this is a very funny movie at times,  though not as funny as number 2. The problem with this movie is that the first two were spoofs on the 60s spy movies, this does not happen in this movie at all.  AP  has become a name brand in and of itself. There are twists and turns in this movie that are good but I think the series is showing its age.  Or perhaps I am showing mine.",1027900800,,550,3.8053097345132745

  In this movie Dr. Evil plan to go back to 1975 to get Goldmember ( Played of course by Mike Myers) but Austin Arrests him. Then Austin Learns that his father is kidnapped and heads to 1975 where he meets Foxy Cleopatra ( Beyounce Knowles). Meanwhile Dr. Evil and Mini-Me escape from prison, meet up with Goldmember in a plan to take over the world.
  All the cast from Austin Powers 2 are back except Heather Graham. (Yes Fat Bastard is back but he provides the best scenes.)This is by far the best Austin Powers movie, but don't expect another sequel.",1027900800,,1006,4.541436464088398
1795597,3,B00006WUWP,"Let's be honest, the stars of any Austin Powers movie is Dr. Evil & Mini Me.  There is just something about Dr. Evil's nerdy ways and affection for Mini Me that makes every moment they're onscreen great!  Unfortunately, Mike Myers has created so MANY characters for this series that most of them are now basically in walk-on roles!  Goldmember was an unnecessary character to create since he has maybe 15 minutes of honest-to-goodness screen time in the film - the rest of the time he's just an extra.  And he didn't do anything Dr. Evil couldn't have been written to do.  Robert Wagner and Frau whatever have a couple of lines each, but this show mostly belongs to Austin and Foxxy (whatever happened to Felicity Shagwell?  She doesn't even have a cameo in this one).  I read that they had 3 1/2 hours of material to sift through to make this movie, let's hope when the DVD comes out they give us most of that material as extras, because it just seems like there's so much we're missing here.  There are a couple of dead-on actors as the teen Austin and Dr. Evil that make me wish for more time in flashback here (those guys are GOOD!).  This is almost a remake of the last one: Austin goes back in time to fight a villian, Austin finds a sexy new partner and brings her back with him to the present, Dr. Evil and Mini Me do a musical number, there's the adult humor about various body parts throughout, Austin and Mini Me have a battle (though this one is 100 times funnier than the one in the last film), etc.  And with the way this one ends, it's obvious that Mike will have to create another new villian for the next one if the series is to progress (though it makes a fitting end as a trilogy) because the villian we're left with at the end just wouldn't be enough to carry a whole film (though it's a great idea).  And with the movie making so much money already, it's obvious there WILL be another installment at some point in the future.  Let's hope Dr. Evil and Mini Me return because the series won't be the same without them.  Oh, and as an added bonus to the series, in this movie we finally learn what Dr. Evil's first name is!",1027900800,,2141,4.3225
1795598,2,B00006WUWP,"As someone who loved the first Austin Powers movie and thought the second pretty good, I am saddened to report that the joke has gotten tired. Not that there aren't worthwhile moments in this film as well, but you could watch the first 10 minutes and then leave the theater secure in the knowledge that you have gotten 90% of the pleasure this movie can impart. I was happy when it ended and would have been even happier if it had done so 10 minutes earlier.
Among the reasons I found this sequel inferior--an even greater emphasis on toilet and genitalia related humor than in the Spy Who Shagged Me (and I know there are certain people who find this kind of thing hilarious, but I'm not one of them)and the reappearance of the repellent Fat Bastard and the appearance of the new villian Goldmember who also has nausea-inducing habits. Dr. Evil is certainly creepy but his actions never made my stomach queasy.
There is a tendency to flog jokes to death and I'm afraid that Mike Myers has gotten too fond of his hero and is starting to treat him like a real one, rather than a parody. Half the fun of the original Austin Powers was watching our hero make [a fool] out of himself, that never happens anymore.
If you are a fan of the first two Austin Powers movies you should probably see this one, because it does have its moments, particularly the first few minutes, but my overall impression of the third film in the series makes no case at all for the production of a fourth.",1027814400,,1478,4.4375
1795599,5,B00006WUWP,"This latest Austin Powers' film will not win an Academy Awards.  It will also not earn a place on anyone's 100 best movies of all time.  Nonetheless,  I heartedly recommend that you see this somewhat vulgar, scatological, and comedy loaded with never ending sexual double entendres.  The consumer product Preparation H is prominently highlighted.  Do I need to elaborate further? Goldmember will bring at least a smile to your face and has a number of really funny scenes.  Austin Powers must once again save the world from the nefarious Dr. Evil.  The plot doesn't make a bit of sense, but who cares?  No one in their right mind expects
Shakespeare or Victor Hugo.  Most viewers have almost certainly seen one or both of the previous Austin Powers' comedic slap stick adventures.  If not, try imagining Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costelo, and the Three Stooges making fun of the James Bond 007 series.
It is unfortunate that I mentioned earlier that Goldmember will not garner any major film award nominations.  Mike Myers is brilliant portraying Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard.  Unfortunately, actors specializing in comedy are routinely ignored.  This is not fair, but it is a fact of life.  Goldmember deserves 4 and a half stars.  Both religious conservatives and the politically correct Left will be outraged---but that's their problem.",1027814400,,1350,5.018018018018018
1795600,1,B00006WUWP,"I liked the first Austin movie, and I thought the ""Spy Who Shagged Me"" was even funnier. Matter of fact, I saw the second one twice when it came on cable. So I was looking forward to watching ""Goldmember"".
I would say I lasted about 20 minutes before I walked out of the theater... Sophomoric isn't the word to use for this dud. First, don't take a kid to see this thing: it was gratuitous with profanity, and the humor was something only a Howard Stern fan would enjoy.  And some of the profanity bordered on an R rating. You'd have to be a very dumb kid not to pick up on the lewdness.
I guess the makers of this super turkey figured the second picture was so hot, so they third would make even more money. And what a dumb script: it made no sense and went beyond ridiculous. If you saw the second Austin movie there was a scene where Dr. Evil  did a musical number with Mini Me, and if you looked at Rob Lowe's face you could see he thought it was weird. Now in ""Goldmember"", Dr. Evil is rapping in prison, and guess what? The prisoners jump in and sing and dance. This movie makes the second movie look like serious drama.
Summary: too profane for kids and too stupid for an adult. Seems like the director couldn't figure out his audience, so he's stuck with this horrible mess. If you're an Austin fan, stick with the memories of ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" and pray they don't make anymore sequels.",1027814400,,1401,4.2631578947368425
1795601,4,B00006WUWP,"Austin Powers movies seem to divide people into two camps: You either hate 'em (Or won't even lower yourself by seeing them) or love 'em. I love 'em, so remember that as you read this review...
  The movie is worth seeing just for the cameos in the first scene. I won't spoil the surprise, and I hope no one else does. Really inspired casting choices....The rest of the film delivers the usual Austin formula- A ridiculous plot that is just a framework to hang the jokes on. This time, Austin needs to rescue his father, played by Michael Caine, from the clutches of Dr. Evil and the underutilized Goldmember (Both played by Mike Myers, who also plays Powers and Fat Bastard), a skin-flake eating euro-swinger who enjoys painting peoples ""Wedding-Tackle"" gold. (Considering all of the legal hoopla that went on regarding the use of the name Goldmember, he really has very little screen time, and contributes nothing to the film, aside from the strange plot to use a tractor beam (""Preparation H"") to pull a meteor into the Earth, thereby flooding it, while the bad guys are safely in their Dr. Evil-shaped Submarine.
  The film suffers from the same problems most other film series do- Too many characters competing for screen time. We've got the returning Austin, Basil Exposition, Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, Frau, Scott, Mini-Me, Number Two (No Mr. Bigglesworth this time, except for a brief flashback), and then there are the new characters, such as Foxxy Cleopatra and Nigel powers....It's a very crowded movie, and it felt a little too long. Caine and Beyonce Knowles are welcome additions to the cast, though, especially Knowles- She does a great job as Foxxy, and she sure is easy on the eyes. I'd like to see her return in the next Powers flick.
  There are some BIG laughs, especially the scene where a bewildered seaman watches Austin and Mini-Me's shadows on a curtain. I laughed so hard I actually cried, and wound up missing some of the scene while I wiped my eyes.

Fat Fastard makes an appearance as a sumo wrestler, Dr. Evil has some funny-as-hell one liners, and the opening scene is one that is both clever and unexpected with enough star power and oscar nominees to be an after-party.
The movie goes as such: Austin Powers finally puts Dr. Evil behind bars but Goldmember, Dr. Evil's accomplise from the 70's, kidnaps Austin's father, Nigel, and takes him back to the 1975.  Austin then heads back to to the 70's only to come back with Foxxy Cleopatra, to find that Dr. Evil has escaped from prison and teamed up with Goldmember to destroy the world unless they are paid not to, and they have Nigel as their prisoner.

I went to the theater really wanting to love this movie just as much as its predecessors (really I did), but there is a problem with the new movie....it's got nothing new to offer...everything here has been done before, and better in other spy/superhero genre entries....
To tell you the truth the beginning of Austin Powers 3 is the best part of the movie.... but it went way down hill after that and the laughs from the audience I was sitting with turned to groans at some of the cheapest and unfunniest sight gags I have seen in ages and disgust as some of the vulgar humor that makes ""Scary Movie 2"" look like ""Mary Poppins"" It's tired, Dr. Evil even told a joke that I heard in high school and it wasn't funny back then.
MGM should slap New Line Cinema --- Austin Powers rips off, Live and Let Die"",""The Spy who Loved Me"" and numerous moments from other James Bond movies... and the trailers for ""Die Another Day"" and ""The Two Towers"" (ie Lord of the Rings 2"")

Umm...Kind of. There are a lot of scenes in the movie that are very funny, and a few that are downright hilarious. But some of the jokes come off stale and repeated. Some of the funniest moments in the film come from the many cameos that there are.
The Good: Dr. Evil is very funny as usual, pulling off some hilarious moments. Mini Me is prob the best part about this film. He's very funny and does some unexpected stuff.
The Bad: Goldmember!! I thought that the new ""Bad Guy"" could have been much better, and I think this is where the film falls short. Goldmember just wasn't that funny. Plain and simple. Also, the ""twist"" on the story at the end, I thought was just plain dumb. A total cop-out. It's almost like they couldn't think of anything so they started watching Days of Our Lives to get ideas. I won't ruin it for you guys that haven't seen the film, but you should know what I'm talking about when you see it.
The In-Between: The supporting cast was as good as usual. Frau, Scott, Number 2 etc. Were likeable and funny as usual. Beyonce was ok, she did a decent job, but I prefer Hurley or Graham. (just my personal preference)
As far as the plot goes...it's weak. real weak. I know this isn't supposed to be Citizen Kane, but the movie really just feels like you're watching commercial free SNL. Which is not all together a bad thing for a comedy like this, but just something to keep in mind. Overall, I would say this is a good movie if you're a big Austin fan or just a fan of gross out slapstick comedy. But don't go in expecting it to be the funniest movie you've ever seen or you're sure to be disapointed.

It was.
I didn't mind the opening credits, with Spielberg and all, but afterwards, it just started downhill and kept on going.  The jokes were mediocre at best, the acting wasn't bad, but the plot, ugh, here we go.
I know this is supposed to be a spoof of a James Bond film, but regardless whether the movie is spoof or not, a good plot is essential.  The biggest problem that lead me to really disliking this film has to be near the end with possibly one of the most clich plot twists that just made me nautious and hoping that there would be an explosion somewhere or another.
The plot twists lead to unnecessary and unexpected personality changes which prevents this film from getting a high rating.  If you think I'm just some nit-picking critic, take a look at this:  I have seen many, MANY films in my lifetime, and out of those, I can only recall three that I don't like.  Three, that's it.

1795609,5,B00006WUWP,"When I found out that there would be a new Austin Powers film I jumped for joy. Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, one of the funniest characters that has been created within the last few years. In this movie he is even funnier than he was in the first two films of the series. The plot in this film is much, much better than the last two were, although the last two were very good.
 Powers' father Nigel has been kidnapped by evil masterminds Doctor Evil and Goldmember, and in this fun film Austin teams up with Foxey Cleopatra (played by the beautiful Beyonce Knowles)to get back Nigel and stop Dr. Evil and his new accomplice Goldmember once and for all. Along the way many things happen, such as a big dance and singing scene with Doctor Evil and Minime. Everything in this film adds up to not only the best movie of the Austin Powers series but also one of the funniest comedies made. While you will be able to understand this movie without seeing the first two films you will enjoy the movie much more if you have seen the first two movies of the series.
 Mike Myers is one of the greatest talents in the film industry. He wrote the movie and did not only play just the character of Austin Powers, but he also played Doctor Evil, Fat Bastard, and a new character, Goldmember. Due to this feat Myers' roles in this film can be compared to those of Eddy Murphy in the Nutty Professor.
 There won't be a second passed without you laughing out loud as the comedy and jokes come non stop throughout the whole course of the film. I think that the funniest part of the movie was the song and dance scene with Doctor Evil and Minime towards the middle of the film. I could not stop laughing during this part, and the same goes for the whole film, for that matter. This comedy is in a class of its own. For a fun filled movie experience that will keep you laughing and laughing, this is the movie to see.

1795610,3,B00006WUWP,"No, ""gold"" doesn't quite cut it.  It doesn't even take the silver  -  more the bronze.  It's the third in the Austin Powers series, and comes in third best.
Which is not to say it's bad, mind, just not as good as its predecessors.
As usual, there are some very funny sight-gags and little mini-routines.  Dr. Evil and Mini-Me get to bust a rap song off of Annie's ""It's A Hard Knock Life,"" in prison  -  and, speaking of songs, Destiny's Child's Beyonce Knowles favors us with the jazzy (but disco, God help us) title theme.  Seth Green's Scott Evil grows to become more like dear old dad, down to losing his hair  -  he even gives Dr. Evil one of his lifelong dreams, sharks with lasers on their heads  -  but unfortunately, he has less to do in this entry than in the preceding ones.  The neglected and displaced Mini-Me defects to ""the good guys,"" and in token of his new allegiance dresses himself into a Mini-Austin, which is hysterically funny.  Dr. Evil's submarine is designed in his image, complete with pinky to the lips  -  and a radar array that extends from the seat of his pants.  Michael Caine couldn't be better cast, as Austin's estranged spy father, Nigel.  And poking fun at 1970s aesthetics is as broad a target as that of Ed Wood's movies  -  no matter where you aim a lampooning barb, you're guaranteed to hit something.
Where the movie disappoints is in the lowered level of its humor  -  which, for this series, is saying a lot.  Myers has progressively descended, with each succeeding entry, from more genuine wit to a greater number of mere physical gross-outs.  His new character  -  the title villain of the piece  -  is definitely as distinctive as any of his many others, but is completely unappealing and actually not very funny.  This movie is not as even or smooth-running as its forerunners  -  the laughs are there, but less consistent and less sustained.
It's worth the price of admission, alone, though, for the Austin Powers movie-within-a-movie that frames the beginning and ending of Goldmember, with so many famous cameos your head will spin.  One of them  -  Gwyneth Paltrow  -  fits so well as Powers' sidekick, you can't help but want to see her do it for real...maybe in the next installment?

1795612,5,B00006WUWP,"This movie topped the second one twice over. It is by far the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.  You will not stop laughing once the movie starts! If you liked the other austin powers movies, or you just have a sick sense of humor you will absolutely love Austin Powers 3: Goldmember!",1027641600,,289,4.351851851851852
1795613,5,B00006WUWP,"As a group, 23, 29, 55 & 57 we unamiously loved this film. Same level of outrage and disgust, but new twists and much more ""tongue in cheek"". Mega star level appeal. Super James Bond style opening. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me do not let us down. Austin's main chick is, well she's beautiful. Opens weird but build's rapidly and Fat Bastard is everything anyone ever hoped for. We're going back tonight, a film to own.",1027641600,,410,4.48
1795614,2,B00006WUWP,"The first 15 minutes of the third installment of Austin Powers seemed very promising. As the movie moves on, it begins to lose it's steam.  Characters seem tired, and in the case of Dr. Evil, even look phyically different.  The story is absolutely weak, as the world is again in danger of being destroyed by one of Evil's stupid/extravagant plans.  The newest character on the side of Evil, Goldmember, is a disgusting Dutchmen with a taste for eating pieces of his own peeling skin.. not funny!  In my opinion the most humorous returning characters are Fat B**ard, and Mini-me.  Beyonc Knowles certainly didn't disappoint me, as her acting lived up to everything terrible I'd hoped it be.  At least they cut her out of most of the movie!  Both of the Austin sequel's would have been better if Elizabeth Hurley could have returned.  Sir Michael Caine as Nigel Powers, Austin's father, did do a good job, and made the audience laugh a few times.
In my opinion, the cameos were the funnest part of the whole movie.  I think Mike Myers maybe getting bored with the series, and I think the audience is getting bored with the same jokes.  Save some money and see this one on rental.",1027641600,,1177,4.615384615384615
1795615,5,B00006WUWP,"One could argue that the titles of the Austin Powers movie's come way to close to the Bond films. But, that's how it was pretty much intended, for these films to be a parody of the famous Ian Fleming series. But, don't think that just because this is the third in the series anything is lost from this fine film in any way. The film has overall good acting with a superb amount of humor present as most people would be laughing a great deal throughout from the small to large nuiances throughout. It is a very enjoyable film and the plot revolves around Dr. Evil joining with a man from Holland who is aptly named ""Goldmember"" due to an accident with a smelter. But, I don't want to spoil too much as some things I might say may inadvertantly give something away. However, I can strongly recommend this movie and say, Go out and see this movie now! If you don't like it, that is your own opinion. But, I just must strongly say that this truly was an enjoyable movie.
One final word: the amount of cameos in the film is amazing and yes, Britney Spears is in it (I know, I'm sorry) But, she isn't present for more than 30 seconds at the beginning and it's just funny what happens. Enjoy!",1027641600,,1185,4.294642857142857
1795616,5,B00006WUWP,i have one word for this movie it was GROOVY!! Austin is back to defeat a new enemy named Goldmember. Ill sum it up for you: austin finds out that dr.evil and himself are brothers and that nigel powers is both of their fathrs. Mini Me joins the ministry of defence and helps defeat the evil orginisation overall it was a very funny movie and Foxy Cleopatra(beonce knoles) was very good for the part when it comes out on DVD i will be the first to have it. it is a must see it is worh evry penny so go out and see it.,1027641600,,516,3.9711538461538463
1795617,5,B00006WUWP,"Austin Powers is back with his groove on this third and final sequal of the Austin Powers series. Although I haven't seen this movie yet, I'm sure it will be hilarious, just like the previous two. The movie, after all will have all the materials which were in the previous ones as well, and all our favorite characters as well.
As for some of the previous reviewers, I don't think you should critisize Beyonce Knowles, just because she's not like Elizabeth Hurley or Heather Graham. You haven't even seen the movie yet, and maybe her role as Foxy Cleopatra is perfect for Beyonce. Anyway, she looks great in the movie, and I don't think people should take the cast of the film too seriously. After all, there are many guest appearances as well such as Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Britney Spears and much more, along with lots of new characters, worth watching for, and it'll be great!!
I think people should see this movie just for fun, Im sure it will be really funny and worth watching.",1027641600,,1007,4.631284916201118
1795618,4,B00006WUWP,"The third installment in the Austin Powers series is very, very funny.  I tend to judge a movie by its entertainment value, and I was certainly entertained.  I laughed so hard at times that I had to struggle to catch my breath.
The first few minutes of the movie is especially clever, with numerous cameos from some of today's biggest stars.  Pay special attention to Danny DeVito, he really steals the first few minutes.
Aside from the first few minutes, the movie was unremarkable.  There is a lot of the same old fraternity boy, bathroom humor, and some rehashed jokes from previous movies.  In this aspect, the jokes got a bit old.
At the same time, there were some new jokes that went over very well.  A Mini-Austin powers was a great idea as was Mike Meyers as Goldmember.  Mini-Me continues to steal the movie without speaking a single word.
If you go to see this movie, you can expect to see some gross out humor, and outrageous clothing.  This type of humor is not for everyone, but I think that everyone can find something appealing about the comic genius of Mike Meyers.",1027641600,,1081,4.564766839378239

This IS the dumbing down of America at it's best.  It's humor is just plan stupid, the acting is a mockery to the actors guild.  There is no entertainment value except to show the rest of the world what americans think is comedy. No wonder we are hated.  The movie is pointless, doesn't go anywhere, it's stupid and is not very creative. There is no value to this film at all. This film is an insult to real comedy.  It's just white trash at it's very best.",1027555200,,614,4.117647058823529

Sure, from seeing the first two you'd think you've seen the jokes one too many times, but Mike Myers and company seem to add new freshness to them every time.  The cameos in the beginning are great, so make sure you're prepared to count the stars..!  This is a shagadelic time at the movies, don't miss it!",1027555200,,394,4.36986301369863
1795621,5,B00006WUWP,"As both an afficiando of 60's and 70's nostagia, and a modern day woman, I wound up liking Beyonce's Foxy Cleopatra much more than I intially anticipated.
The inital annoucement of her casting caused some concern, but early previews indicate she may be Austin's most intriguing partner yet. Unlike Hurley and Grahmm, whose spy role belied an unconvincing innocence, Cleopatra is a street smart sister in the traddition of Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones (her name is a fusion of the two blaxploitation characters).",1027296000,,513,5.119047619047619

Like Come on guy's Beyonce is brillant in everything she does and will be brillant in this.  Now About the 'Fro,  So many had them back then they were hip, groovy, and wild.  Even from the previews  you can tell she won't have it in all the time.  In the last Austin Powers video the female side kick had terrible acting skills, but just don't think about it to much just like the plot.  There are many movies out there with bad acting but are still good movies, so even if you think Beyonce can't act (Even though I know She Won't let us down) just remember all the effort she has put fourth, and throw her a freakin' bone here alright.  Beyonce is a good rolemodel for alot of people and i'm sure will be a good actress.  Beyonce I love you you are great and don't let the haters bring ya down!",1026777600,,1004,4.182291666666667
1795624,3,B00006WUWP,"I loved both Austin Powers movies, but this is going a bit far in my opinion. I fear it may suffer from ""sequel-itis"".
And-I agree that Knowles was a bad choice for the new sidekick. From the previews I've seen, she is over-acting way too badly. She's trying way to hard to be a ""good"" actress-and it'll smother Austin's style of humor in the movie, in my opinion. (And I HATE that afro-*shudders*)
Other than that-I'm always happy to watch a kick-back, just plain fun ""stupid"" movie. Meyers is VERY talented and in my opinion-surprisingly classy in his humor. And-the music's pretty cool too.
Hope everyone enjoys it-I'll be there when it opens. :-)",1026518400,,650,4.7105263157894735

7973319,3,B00006WUWP,"Mike Myers is literally everywhere in his third romp as the super suave (and super dated) gentleman spy, playing four significant parts under hefty amounts of makeup and gear. He's still surprisingly funny, as is the film itself, although the screen often feels terribly crowded and the constant diversions and subplots get carried away. Much more than the two preceding films, Goldmember is a Python-esque collage, a string of skits and strung-out gags with a loose connecting narrative wound in-between. It's joyfully energetic, like a toddler, with an attention span to match. The goofs and send-ups themselves range from hilarious to beaten-to-death (particularly the dumb obsession with one character's absurdly huge mole, which is trotted out in at least three different scenes) and occasionally lean on a weirdly hyper-focused topical humor that's showing its age now. Many of the old bits from preceding films are rolled back out for an encore, but they're matched at least shot-for-shot with new segments that, surprisingly, hold their own. It's particularly important that the jokes land, because the plot is mostly scraps and stabs. Michael Caine is an inspired choice as Austin's long-lost father, but the two don't get much screen time together and it feels like a wasted opportunity. Beyonc's take on the classic blaxploitation-era heroine type is spirited, if light and inessential. Despite the shortcomings, it's still good for a few big laughs and my wife and I reference it somewhat regularly. I prefer it to The Spy Who Shagged Me, though it can't hope to match the heart, balance or ingenuity of the original.",1520640000,,1629,5.197718631178708
