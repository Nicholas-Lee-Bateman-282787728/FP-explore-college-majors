8009923,4,B0001CLCLI,"""The Astral Traveler"" features a good performance from guest star Sean McClory and allows intrepid Will Robinson (Billy Mumy) an opportunity to return to Earth, albeit in vintage Scotland, no doubt.

""The Galaxy Gift"" guests movie veteran John Carradine and marks the return of the dark-suited trio of aliens last seen in ""Wreck of the Robot.""  Penny (Angela Cartwright) gets her chance to travel to ""San Francisco.""

These two episodes, though not as good as the first season's B & W ones, are an improvement over much of the second's SILLIER one.",1095292800,,548,4.934782608695652
