8191105,5,B000PFUA3C,"Was concerened about a previous reviewer stating The Aviator was full screen, but i purchased anyway because it was such a good deal, and to be honest, The Aviator wasn't the main attraction here for me.

Can happily report box set came perfectly packaged, alllll 4 films are widescreen and play flawlessly. Additionally, all are double DVDs full of extras. (Except Mean Streets, which is a standard single disc with special features included)

Gotta say im more than impressed, incredible value and the box set looks great!

HIGHLY recommend! Mean Streets is AMAZING.",1514505600,,568,5.086021505376344
8191106,5,B000PFUA3C,"great films and great price. don't believe the other reviews for this boxed set. 4 films all widescreen. 3 of them are two disc, mean streets is 1 disc.",1354147200,2,152,4.275862068965517

I can't think of any other explanation (there is no excuse) for mistaking di Caprio for an actor (which is about as ludicrous as mistaking McDos for restaurants). And, since he's persisting in polluting the screens with something whose only merit is he never will be a ""Has Been"" (since he never was anything in the first place), from now on I will keep clear from Scorcese's movies.",1223424000,,458,4.7375
8191108,3,B000PFUA3C,"This is something so rare that I must write about it - a boneheaded decision by Warner Home Video when packaging one of their boxed sets. Why is this set selling so poorly you might ask? Why are used copies going for half of SRP? The answer is that for some reason the version of The Aviator included in this set is fullscreen. That's right - two disc versions of three of Martin Scorsese's finest films and one of them is fullscreen. I just can't get over it. With all of the sweeping aerial scenes, the scenes in the Cocoanut Grove, etc., and Warner's expects someone to plop down sixty plus dollars for a set that includes a fullscreen version of The Aviator?

Well, this is Warner Bros. 85th anniversary, and they did redo the Kubrick set last year, so let's hope they redo this set and get it right. I don't actually own this set. I own all of the individual movies and was thinking about buying this set recently as a gift to someone else when it went on sale at a drastically reduced price. A little research on another site turned up this information, so I hope I am not wrong in my post here.

My score is three stars as follows:
5 stars for the films themselves
1 star for ruining the entire thing with the fullscreen version of The Aviator.
Result = 3 stars with the two scores averaged together.",1204761600,7,1307,4.330612244897959
