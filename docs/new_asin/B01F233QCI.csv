8759950,3,B01F233QCI,"This 2005 movie is about 2 friends from childhood who are inseparable (Bobby Deol and Akshay Kumar). They are more like a romantic couple in some ways than just friends. Their love and friendship is so great that at many different points one will be more concerned with the others best interests. This does complicate their lives at times but it also enhances their lives and those around them.
This is a romance so there are romantic interests with Kareena Kapoor and Lara Dutta.  Not a lot is required of either woman though as the focus is on the friendship. Kareena particularly puts a lot of nuance into her performance and makes the most of any time she is on the screen.
It is about the men and both Bobby and Akshay do a good job of it - particularly Akshay who delivered some quite mature emotion and subtlety.
Without giving the plot away, not all goes smoothly and there is a lot of melodrama at the end that pulls at the heartstrings. It managed to move me though and I always appreciate a movie that made me care enough to do that.
In fairness I should point out my younger so-watcher abandoned it early when it was in a brief patch of irritating silliness when Lara's character was setting up controlling tests and hoops for Bobby to jump through.
The music was OK and there were a few catchy and upbeat group dance scenes but mostly they were about romantic duos, and friends binding songs. In some ways this movie had an older feel to it as if it had been made at the end of the 1900s rather than as recently as 2005.
This one tends to get average to a bit above average responses elsewhere on the Net -  though some can rate it up to 8 or so out of 10 in some instances. If you like Bollywood romance/melodramas with heart its probably worth trying. It certainly isn't one for the arthouse/realism lovers. The male bonding theme seems to be appealing to some males - unusually for a romance.",1241308800,,1908,4.402266288951841
