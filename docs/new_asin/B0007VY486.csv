2245827,5,B0007VY486,"NFL Greatest Follies, the Complete Collection, contains 2 DVD's of 6 hilarious NFL Follies movies great for any fan of the sports blooper.

1)  The Football Follies:  This 1968 film was the first NFL Films follies, which started the series.  Although the highlights are quite dated and tame for the ESPN generation, it's a glimpse of the league during that AFL-NFL era.

2)  The Son of Football Follies:  John Facenda and Mel Blanc!  Hysterical, with various WB cartoon voices (Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and Yosemite Sam) adding to the humor of the clips.

3)  NFL Follies Go Hollywood:  John Facenda creates his own movie previews to introduce each of the various-themed highlights and get a quick glimpse of him on the camera!

4)  21st Century Follies:  A follie video for the modern era up to the 2000 season.

5)  Talkin' Follies:  Probably the weakest of the bunch.  It's just voice overs of locker room, sideline, and fan moments.

6)  NFL's 100 Greatest Follies:  Contains all of the bloopers of the century, although not introduced in order.  They're grouped by themes, so it's not a countdown ranking, but still enjoyable.  Finally, I saw the highlight I was trying to find.  Yes, an NFL player thought he scored a touchdown, however he ran the other way.",1158105600,65,1262,4.789719626168225
2245828,5,B0007VY486,I bought this for entertaining friends at our weekly get together. Great for men's get together.,1440374400,,96,5.0625
2245829,1,B0007VY486,I was very disappointed with this DVD. In my opinion the Follies were not very humorous and the collection is mostly old old footage. I am sorry that I bought it. I was expecting contemporary footage maybe starting in the 90's. Instead this DVD is a mixture of the 50's and 60's. The quality was not good.,1436832000,,305,4.368421052631579

2245832,4,B0007VY486,"Unlike volume three, the first two volumes (apart from one part of two) are follies from the beginning of football. If you like teams when they first started, you'll love this! A good DVD to watch during the long off season.",1424390400,,224,4.487804878048781

2245836,4,B0007VY486,Most of the follies was very funny and some was boring.  The boring was when they put words of the moving lips of the football players was pretty lame.  Actually footage with music and narration was very good.,1411171200,,209,4.473684210526316
2245837,3,B0007VY486,Not as good as some others I have seen.,1410566400,,39,3.4444444444444446

2245844,1,B0007VY486,DVD was a terrible disappointment. I have always enjoyed and admired NFL films including some of the follies efforts. This has to be one of their earliest attempts as its quality and content was extremely poor and not close to the standards I have grown to appreciate. It was not even entertaining. My bad for not knowing more about the specifics of the item I ordered.,1404345600,,369,4.606060606060606
2245845,5,B0007VY486,"whether you're a sports fan or not, this is hilarious, what a great dvd to play before the game, or to finish out a game when you're having those football parties.",1400112000,,163,4.290322580645161
2245846,5,B0007VY486,We loved this so much we watched it numerous times and have just ordered the boxed set with all of the dvd's. My boys are all huge sports fans and this was perfect for them. So funny!,1399161600,,183,3.972972972972973
2245847,1,B0007VY486,Not worth the money. Quite a dated project. Boring on many levels.  It occurs to me that the work was not worthy of the review,1389139200,,126,4.04
2245848,4,B0007VY486,"The kids like this DVD, but they really wanted to see some names they knew (aside from some HoF'rs). Most of the content is from the 80 and early 90's.",1388880000,,151,4.066666666666666
2245849,3,B0007VY486,I thought the clips would be a little more of current players.  But we had fun watching the Follies.  Enjoyed spending the time with the family to review the clips.,1388102400,,164,4.433333333333334
2245850,5,B0007VY486,This was a gift for a football fan.  He was very happy to get it and it should keep him occupied in the off-season!,1385164800,,115,3.7916666666666665
2245851,3,B0007VY486,wish it had newer stuff on it but it was a gift for my brother he seemed to enjoy it,1372204800,,84,3.25
2245852,1,B0007VY486,"Wish I hadn't bothered. You can only hear a narrator say ""Hang on to the ball!"" so many times before you turn it off. No mention made of the players or whether it impacted the game or anything interesting. I threw it away.",1366329600,,222,4.186046511627907
2245853,4,B0007VY486,"This was great to watch, it reminded me of my childhood wathcing these old videos.  I wouldn't really recommend it for kids of this day and age.  They need something more fast paced.  My boys weren't too interested and they love football!",1365465600,,238,4.619047619047619
2245854,5,B0007VY486,Good but not great. Fun to watch a time or too but in the end that is what follies are about I guess.,1361232000,,101,3.4347826086956523
2245855,4,B0007VY486,"I bought this for my 11 year old grandson ( my two sons-in-law watched it with him) and based on the laughter I heard, I would say they loved it!",1357862400,,145,3.8666666666666667
2245856,4,B0007VY486,"This is a great collection! made the perfect gift for my football-crazy brother, and i would reccomend this as a purchase or as a gift!",1354665600,,135,4.44
2245857,3,B0007VY486,"I have mixed feelings about this set.  The visuals of the follies, etc., are great:  funny, enjoyable, and even a few ""wows"".  The ""choreography"" to classic music such as excerpts of the Nutcracker Suite are really well done.

However, I found the ""Talkin' Follies"" (voice-overs that put words in people's mouths other than what they truly said) so annoying that I quit watching it. Also, I do not find listening to ""Bugs Bunny"" et al either funny or helpful; to me such things are distracting and actually lessen the humor. Since that film also has one of the great ""ballet"" segments, I'm going to hit the mute button until I reach the ""ballet"" when I watch it in the future.  I also found the commentary on the first film lessened the humor of the activities caught on film, and will mute it in the future until I reach its ""ballet"" segment.

The best of the films, in my opinion, is the ""100 Greatest Follies"".  All are numbered, though only the top 10 are in sequence. The commentary is better and doesn't distract or detract from the follies themselves. As a result, the humor of what I was watching actually got me laughing because there wasn't an undercurrent of frustration caused by the narrators. And the follies chosen are truly funny.

I, as others reviewing here, was puzzled by the title of the last film, because it is not follies that occurred in the 21st century (so a misnomer, in my opinion), but a film released in the 21st century.

I really enjoy football, and really enjoy classic football (say, pre-90's, roughly), so the visual portion is great and highly recommended.  The narration and ""Talkin' Follies"" aspects are what lowered my rating to 3 stars.",1315612800,4,1677,4.673469387755102
2245858,5,B0007VY486,"This item was exactly what I expected it to be, the same NFL Films I watched as a youth, yet now on DVD.",1315526400,4,104,3.5652173913043477
2245859,3,B0007VY486,My husband was a bit disappointed by the DVD's.  He remembered them being better when he was younger.  My boys enjoyed watching them nonetheless.,1262131200,2,145,5.0
2245860,4,B0007VY486,"I teach an Earth Science class, and run segments from the NFL follies before class begins, and during breaks.  It really helps to set a fun, informal tone for the class, and is a real crowd-pleaser.

Vry entertaining.",1250985600,2,217,4.684210526315789
2245861,4,B0007VY486,"I would have liked to have seen some College bloopers in football on this.  Realizing that it is limited to the NFL, it is still a great find. Darren Lossia",1239926400,2,156,4.2
2245862,5,B0007VY486,"This was a holiday gift for my 10 yr. old boys who live and breathe football.  The love anything that has to do with football, and this video set didn't disappoint.  Although they watch it numerous times, every now and then it's a family affair with lots of giggles and reminiscing.",1238284800,3,282,4.509803921568627
2245863,5,B0007VY486,I bought this DVD set for my nephew (10 years old) for Christmas and he loves it. It cracked him up and he watches it over and over.,1232582400,2,132,3.75

2245866,5,B0007VY486,"This collection is a reissue of six of the NFL's popular ""Follies"" films consisting of bloopers, the antics of both players and fans, and plays that have gone so very wrong dating back to 1959, as far as I can tell from watching the earliest video. There's a lot of entertainment per dollar on this DVD set, and I consider it a worthy purchase. Here's what you get:

Disc 1
The Football Follies (1968) 20 minutes.
A documentary-style film typical of 1960's vintage NFL films. What seems odd is that nobody ever identifies the players involved.  They were just considered the workhorses of the league back then, not supermen with the rock star status they enjoy today.

The Son of Football Follies (1976) 23 minutes
A clip show with John Facenda narrating using his trademark NFL films broadcast voice and Mel Blanc narrating using the voices of Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, and the other characters for which he is famous.

NFL Follies Go Hollywood (1983) 25 minutes
Made immediately after VCRs became so popular, this entry has a documentary structure. It contains trailers, a comedy short entitled ""Keystone Korterbacks"", and fake newsreels just like the movies of yesteryear.

Disc 2
NFL's 100 Greatest Follies (1994) 45 minutes
Starting with this film, the Follies get much longer, and there is much overlap with the first three. The big difference is this time the players involved are named. We have now entered the age of the football player as rock star.

Talkin' Follies (1997) 45 minutes
Consists of voiceovers for the dialogue between players and coaches, coaches and officials, even some good shots of what a couple of owners could be saying. Thanks to wireless devices, we also have a good amount of actual on-field dialogue. Its style appears to be capitalizing on the popularity of Mystery Science 3000.

21st Century Follies (2000) 45 minutes
The sixth and final Follies feature included is oddly named since the 21st century had just started. Like the 1997 film, there are more actual conversations due to wireless helmet devices, plus some interesting end-zone dances, out-takes from actual NFL Films interviews, a receiver running into a kicking net, and other such antics. The wireless devices are a double-edged sword here: You have a lot of humorous on-field spontaneity, but there is also quite a bit of bad language.

There are no extras included. This is a great treat for any football fan, especially during this long off-season when we suffer through the rest of the NBA season, the beginning of baseball season, and wait for that first pre-season game. Highly recommended.",1170028800,36,2597,4.954022988505747
2245867,5,B0007VY486,We gave this to our 7-year-old son (a football fanatic) for Christmas. He has watched it more than once and laughs and really enjoys it. A great gift for a football lover -- probably more entertaining for kids and teens than adults.,1167609600,14,232,4.5476190476190474
