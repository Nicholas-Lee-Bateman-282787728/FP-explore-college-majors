3627624,5,B001HB1K0A,One of the greatest standup performances ever. It will never get the credit but I'd put it up with some of the greats.,1238371200,,118,4.173913043478261

3627626,4,B001HB1K0A,"Kevin Hart made me laugh, out loud nonetheless. Here's an example of his material. [loosely quoted] I'm not a fighter. Say we're at the movies having a good time. Out of nowhere some guy comes up and smacks you in the face real hard. If you with me, you just got smacked. We can talk about it when we get in the car. But I aint gonna do nothing about it. Because if he didn't care about your face, I know he don't care about mine. [/loose quote] Like most black comedians (except for Aisha Tyler), he's got this great, casual delivery. He also talks about his baby's head wobbling, marriage, and altercations at clubs. If you've seen Chapelle, Foxx, Rock dig a little deeper into the genre and watch this.",1236470400,,705,4.3893129770992365
3627627,5,B001HB1K0A,Kevin Hart's I'm a Grown Little Man stand up is hilarious. I ordered the dvd. Saw its premiere on Comedy Central. I laughed from beginning to end. It's nice to get so much laughter from a comedian who doesn't stick to the routine song and dance of making fun of audience or joking about race. WATCH IT. BUY IT! You will not be disappointed!,1235520000,,340,4.328125
3627628,5,B001HB1K0A,"I first saw Kevin Hart on Comedy Central and I was laughing so hard that I was crying. It is absolutely funny from beginning to end.  But since Comedy Central left out a lot of his jokes I just had to find his stand up on DVD. Kevin Hart's stand up is funny I got two copies, one for me and one for my best friend and her husband.  I think his stand up is funnier than Kat Williams Pimpin' Pimpin'!",1233792000,23,398,3.9012345679012346

3627630,5,B001HB1K0A,"I've never seen his stand up, well except a 30 min stand up he did, which was funny as hell. So I was going through my T.V. Guide and seen that this was coming on Comedy Central, I Tivo'd it and finally got around to watching it. Damn, Kevin Hart is hella funny. This is one of the best stand-ups I've seen, I really hope he does some more like this because it had me laughing the whole damn time. And to think I almost didn't check him out, what a mistake that would have been. Between him and Bill Burr they got the best stand up's I've seen from 08-09 so far with Katt Williams coming in 3rd. Definetly check this one out, you won't be sorry!!!!!!",1233532800,13,650,4.0859375

3627665,5,B001HB1K0A,"In a nutshell:

Too funny! His facial expressions and his tone of voice are really well done. Man pigeon that was probably my favorite part.

The nitty-gritty:

Funny stuff, go check it out! I really didn't know about Kevin Hart until watching Get Hard. We found that he had some stand up comedy videos and man it was worth it. The way he expresses himself, his scenarios and just his laugh and smile are worth it. Very glad I watched this video, haven't laughed like that in a while.

SPOILERS AHEAD

I was surprised he brought his kids out in the end, that was awesome, not many folks do that, especially when he is there all up talking smack about them, respect man!

The part about the man pigeon (Ostrich) was just too funny!

I loved how he started to get scared and said the lines of:
we really don't know what that means
and
we don't know what hes trying to say
and
i going to kill you and eat your kids

But the title he gave it Man pigeon TOO FUNNY! I feel like changing my pen name to Man Pigeon yeah I liked it that much. Stop reading, go watch it!

In my opinion he's a ""GREAT"" like: Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, Red Fox, Jim Carey, Dr. Bill Cosby (allegations aside) Whoopie Goldberg, Robin Williams, and Eddie Murphy, Lucy.

Not just funny, very funny.  So I took a chance on this and two others of his videos.  Hilarious and top notch comedy on this Kevin Hart DVD!  He's a man with a brain for comedy.  And interestingly, he doesn't swell on vulgarity to make you laugh out loud.  He just talks about his life and is hilarious in doing so.  Of the three DVDs I bought, this is one of two to buy.  You won't be disappointed.  Although I love comedy, I don't usually laugh out loud.  I laughed out loud again and again watching this video!  Buy this one!",1416441600,,695,4.174242424242424

3627746,5,B001HB1K0A,"Gotta be up front when I say that right now he is my favorite comedian.  Have watched him on the comedy channel a few times, recently saw him in ""Ride Along"" (a great movie!) and loved him even more, so decided to purchase a DVD of his standup.  This is a new one I haven't already seen him do, which is great.  He is FUNNY.  Laugh-out-loud funny.  But of course, like everything else, everyone has their own idea of what is funny.  He does use colorful language, so you won't want kids around while watching this.  But I loved this.  What I didn't like was the extra bonus stuff you can choose to watch or not after watching his set.  There was an interview with him and although he seemed like a really good father to his kids, he didn't appear to be a good husband at all.  That kinda knocks him down some pegs in my opinion.  But he is funny.  Just not in the interview.",1394582400,,874,4.167664670658683

Let me tell you, I had to stop eating because my stomach could not hold food and laugh at the same time.  Then I showed it to a friend of mine and he had to stop drinking because he almost sprayed me.  Funniest comedy show I hav seen in a long time",1265155200,2,353,3.861111111111111
3627873,5,B001HB1K0A,"Incredible performance by an incredible performer. Kevin Hart was able to put together a show with laughs from beginning to end. Not in the same vein as other great performers like Louis C.K. but is incredible in his own way. Definitely worth the purchase, one of the top 5 comedians in the game right now. Support Comedy!!",1264982400,,323,4.684210526315789
3627874,5,B001HB1K0A,Kevin Hart is freakin hilarious. This DVD had me laughing from beginning. I would love to see him perform live,1262217600,,110,4.55
3627875,5,B001HB1K0A,"This DVD is hysterical.  Kevin Hart has a quick wit and finds ways to laugh at himself, his friends and his family and he pulls you right in with him.  This will have you in tears.  Please get and share this DVD.  He is to comedy today what Bill Cosby was in the 60's and 70's.  He makes everyday truths really funny.",1260835200,,317,4.048387096774194
3627876,5,B001HB1K0A,"This DVD is an instant classic and will be played over and over again in my house. It's the kind of stand-up performance that you end up quoting over and over again. I know, because I and everyone I know that has seen it do it all the time.

The quality of the filming is very good. It is a single performance, not something that was put together over a series of performances like other stand-up DVDs I've seen. The audience's laughter was truly genuine, absolutely no laugh track needed here!

Kevin talks about his children (son and daughter), gives us several examples of ""proof"" that he's not a fighter, his height, trouble with gnats, a family white-water-rafting disaster, being chased by an ostrich (my personal favorite!) and much more. He does use profanity but it's nowhere near what a lot of others use.

One warning though, there's a ""special feature"" where he's in a hotel room apparently earlier during the day of the performance itself. He's with his family including his two children - unfortunately I don't recommend taking the time to watch it, it's not very funny. His family and the kids are obviously uncomfortable being on camera like that and Kevin himself really just seems like he's forcing the issue to say stuff for the camera. I don't hold this against him though, it's likely he was told to provide some filler for the DVD so he did. This does not affect the quality of the performance one bit!

I recommend this DVD to everyone, it's simply hilarious.",1260748800,,1482,4.666666666666667
3627877,1,B001HB1K0A,I could not enjoy this DVD because the security strip was placed on the data side of the DVD.  I tried to slowly remove the security strip but there was absolutely too much adhesive apply to the DVD.  I would have returned it but I neglected to save the return information.  Could not enjoy this DVD.  Will have to buy this somewhere else.,1258761600,2,339,4.333333333333333
3627878,5,B001HB1K0A,I had seen this dvd over a friend's house and I laughed until I cried! I IMMEDIATELY went home and ordered it. I love Amazon already and the movie arrived promptly as always and I am still laughing.,1258588800,,198,4.2368421052631575
3627879,5,B001HB1K0A,"Kevin Hart is hilarious. This man will have you in tears and in pain, I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. I also saw him live in D.C. at the Lincoln Theater and he had all new jokes. He is the best doing it. You will LOVE him.",1257724800,2,235,3.72

3627881,5,B001HB1K0A,Kevin Hart is rapidly becoming one of my favorite comics...he is talented and the laughter is spot on and too the heart of things...pun intended. He leaves no topic uncovered and his spin on gangsta rap and little personal situations we've all faced at one time or another is just too funny. His comedy directed at himself is so funny you forget he is talking about the guy you're laughing at...a must have for comedy club buffs.,1257552000,,429,4.584415584415584
3627882,5,B001HB1K0A,"Kevin Hart is one of the funniest stand-up comedians I've seen in a while. Every story that he told, he was able to paint such a picture that you felt like you were there.  That's why the laugh that comes from you is so boisterous, because you feel connected.  You will love this video! Well worth the money!",1257292800,,308,4.293103448275862
3627883,5,B001HB1K0A,I like Kevin Hart to begin with from the various movies he has acted in because he is naturally funny. This standup is ridiculous;y funny! I laughed basically the entire time! This is my first writing a review for anything so you know it had to be funny! I bought the new Katt Williams DVD on 10/13 and it had nothing on this dvd. And thats being honest.,1256342400,,354,4.220588235294118
3627884,5,B001HB1K0A,This was a excellent standup performance. Kevin Hart is one of the best new comedian out there. You can't go wrong with purchasing this dvd.,1254614400,,140,4.64
3627885,5,B001HB1K0A,"It the funniest dvd that I have. He could be one of the best right now and in the future. Don""t miss out on this one. You Will not see anything this year that will compare to KEVIN HART.",1253404800,,186,3.7948717948717947
3627886,5,B001HB1K0A,This you man is simply hillarious. His combination of acting and joke telling set him a cut above most comedians. I would rank him in the same league as Cedric The Entertainer and Dave Chappelle.,1252022400,,195,4.6
3627887,5,B001HB1K0A,"This dvd is hilarious!! Kevin Hart is a really nice guy too, i met him after a show here in CA and he was awesome! If u can't see him live, this dvd is the next best thing! TELL UR FRIENDS TO BUY THIS TOO!",1251590400,,205,3.577777777777778
3627888,5,B001HB1K0A,"This is a must have. Had me laughing through out the whole thing. I've watched it a few times and it never gets old. I agree with others where he just flows through it. I love how it's things people can relate too and he didn't have to talk about hoes, drugs and negative stuff. Highly recommended!",1249862400,,298,4.245614035087719
3627889,5,B001HB1K0A,"HE WAS THE FUNNIEST EVER. I LAUGHED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END, AND I WASN'T EVEN HIGH YA'LL. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY HE WAS BETTER THAN KATT WILLIAMS, HOWEVER THEY ARE RUNNING NECK TO NECK. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT I RECOMMEND IT. I TOLD EVERYONE I KNOW, HELL I JUST BROUGHT IT AND WATCH IT BACK TO BACK. IT WILL HELP THOSE WHO ARE DEPRESSED. TRY THIS FOR MEDICATION.LOL.",1249430400,,370,4.152777777777778

The first week we had the dvd we watched it probably about 8 times (look into getting the Shaq & Cedric Entertainer All-Star Comedy dvd releasing later on this year it has him and others in it, quite hilarious). This is one to surely have in your collection.",1248048000,,399,4.194805194805195

3627894,5,B001HB1K0A,"What are you waiting for??! Don't even bother reading anymore reviews. In fact, stop reading this and buy this DVD and buy one for anyone you know that loves great comedians!! Why are you still reading? This guy is hilarious! His humor won't offend (although he uses some foul language). He's easy to keep up with. His jokes make sense and they flow together instead of the awkward moments of silence when comedians pull jokes out of the air. And he doesn't spend to much time on one joke trying to make if funny. Neither does he spend to much time in the crowd, which personally tells me you don't have any talent so you have to pick on people in the audience. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING!! I personally guarantee you'll laugh from beginning to end. I'm not giving you anything if you don't. That just means you have NO sense of humor. He has so much potential. I'm going to keep my eye on him. He has a beautiful family. He's a proud father and doting husband. Good luck and God bless Kevin Hart.",1243036800,8,996,4.360215053763441
