8103109,4,B000E0EBIS,"Ever since the phenomenal Angry Beavers episode celebrating the mindless B movie, not to mention plenty of Mystery Science Theatre, my sister and I have sought the ultimate endearing flop. I don't know if this is ""the ultimate,"" but it is in the running. The story line is predictable, and the characters are major losers. Nothing will surprise you, as far as mystery goes. But incredibly, the writers tapped into one thing that redeemed the movie -- at least for those with a twisted sense of humor -- and that is pure, unabashed antagonism. Far more successful classic films like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and the TV movie Scavenger Hunt tapped into the same humor, which comes from pitting stupidity against itself (in the form of character conflicts). The ""hero"" in this movie is a complete idiot, and I can't say that you will be impressed by him...yet placed in context to the others in the film, he comes off as genius. Patel is probably the only truly sympathetic character you will find. But if you are the type of person who gets a laugh at comedic banter or from watching complete idiots be stupid, you may get the humor here. Don't bother if you're looking for a serious mystery flick. You'll be disappointed.",1397606400,,1227,4.658986175115207
