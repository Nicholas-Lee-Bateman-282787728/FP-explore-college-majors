8439773,3,B004SIGZJU,"I ordered double disc, but only got one disc.  Unless I don't know to flip the one disc over and play the other side, I paid for something that I didn't get. But, it arrived quickly and in good condition - and the content itself was fantastic.",1399248000,,243,4.170212765957447
8439774,5,B004SIGZJU,"This movie chronicles the life of 3 independent wrestlers on the road for a stretch of time. If you're a pro wrestling fan, you should see this movie. Its a lot of fun, and has a lot of heart and humor. I was initially taken back by the 2 hour and 40 minute runtime before watching it, but afterwards, I wished there was more (yes, I did also get the bonus disc).",1311120000,2,363,4.055555555555555
