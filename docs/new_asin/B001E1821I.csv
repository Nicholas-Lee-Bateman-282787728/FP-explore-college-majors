3545137,5,B001E1821I,"Well done!!!  Having worked in the fields as a child, I could taste the dirt and sweat, feel their thirst and the baking heat, and remember the flies and mosquitoes.  And, yes, lice.  Life was hard back then. This film gives a glimpse of what it was like.  When we got paid for what we did (piece work), we could make pretty good money.  The sugar beet farmer in this movie has to have been the spawn of the devil.  There were some farmers and ranchers who were decent, and others simply awful.  God bless all the people who have been treated unjustly.  And, God bless the farmers and ranchers who were fair.  By the way, my brother and I were often the only Caucasians working in the orchards and cutting sheds in the late 40s and early 50s.",1455580800,,742,4.280575539568345

3545153,4,B001E1821I,I am enjoying watching this DVD but the movie would feel much more authentic if Spanish was spoken with English subtitles. I doubt if many migrant workers from Mexico or the U S spoke English  the 50's.,1430006400,,202,4.45945945945946

3545158,5,B001E1821I,"This is a very good movie to view if you are studying migrant workers, and the life that they face.  The movie is primarily set in Texas.  However, the story takes you to other states where crops are harvested by the migrant workers.  I live in Texas, and I have taught at a Migrant School.  I found this film to be very close to the actual true migrant story.  If you want to know the truth, without a sugar-coating to it, then watch this movie...if you can stand the truth of this hard life!",1400544000,,493,4.202127659574468
3545159,2,B001E1821I,"The movie feels very dated... Melodramatic, slow, unsympathetic characters, and daytime TV caliber acting. Pass on this one if you can.",1392681600,,135,5.476190476190476
3545160,4,B001E1821I,"This is a story about a young Mexican boy who is quiet and attemps to do what he is learned is right. He goes through many trials because he does what he is told. At the same time he learns, because he is quiet and listens and watches, what hipocrites people are. He becomes internally stronger from each episode that he experiences.",1390953600,,333,4.387096774193548
3545161,4,B001E1821I,My mother and father as well as my grandparents and other family members always talked of the days portrayed in this movie. Most of my family worked as farmers and some as migrant workers so the movie was fun to watch and I watched  with my mother who really enjoyed as it stirred memories of her childhood.,1390867200,,307,4.385964912280702
3545162,5,B001E1821I,"If you are looking for a Hollywood style production with a tightly prescribed story arc and exaggerated dramatization, you may want to move on. On the other hand, if you can appreciate the subtle flavors of a film that moves like the turning pages of a journal through the seasons and develops depth as it simmers and stews, this earthy vignette of the lives of migrant farm workers in the 50s will take you to another time and place, and entrance you with its authentic portrayal of an existence that is at once charming and poignant. Whether you are seeking pure entertainment or a better appreciation of the history of Latin American workers in the farm industry, this film is well worth watching.",1385942400,,700,4.699186991869919
3545163,4,B001E1821I,"What happened to the child actor in this movie? I h's ave watched another movie by him, also as a child actor and he is good. He must be in his late 20's or early 30's.",1380758400,,168,3.6944444444444446
3545164,2,B001E1821I,This movie was very slow and predictable with little to interest the viewer. Some interesting scenes but overall average at best. I Would not recommend.,1378512000,,152,5.12
3545165,5,B001E1821I,"A must read for anyone interested in learning what Mexican-Americans lived through in the '40s and 50's.  It is difficult to come away from this read without being profoundly changed.  I was a very young boy in Uvalde, Texas  in the late 40's and 50's and saw first hand how these people were treated.  That the author comes from Crytsal City, Texas lends authenticity to the narrative that is profound.",1378080000,,403,4.714285714285714
3545166,5,B001E1821I,It was very entertaining and the acting was actually quite good! I recommend it highly and suggest you see it with an open mind.,1376524800,,128,4.375

3545168,5,B001E1821I,This movie captured quite a bit of the essence of being a migrant worker. The tenacity and dedication of the people is remarkable.,1375660800,,130,4.695652173913044
3545169,5,B001E1821I,"Touching story of an boy growing up in an immigrant family and all the hardships and injustices they experienced.
If you are looking for a feel good story, this is not it, but nevertheless a well made film that captures life back in the days for immigrant farm workers.",1373328000,,269,4.510204081632653

3545176,5,B001E1821I,"I teach a H.S. Spanish IV course.  Part of my curriculum is the Chicano Movement and we read the novel this film was created from.  The novel has created such great conversation and interest.  We also view this film. It is a very good depiction of the novel - although the novel in itself could be interpreted in many ways.  This novel is written in both English and Spanish so could be used in a variety of language courses.  It is a MUST in teaching Chicano History, life of migrant workers, immigration, Mexican-American History....... etc.",1274054400,,543,4.673684210526316
3545177,5,B001E1821I,"This movie kept it down to earth. I like those types of movies that don't have to much superficialities. The scene editing style and cinematography kept me interested and in the grace of the writers original idea. The original idea it seems is a struggle between letting one's self be indulged in the hardships of examining the self or being overburden with the struggles which one faces, considering what this boy is thrown at him. The boy is given the complexities of being a Mexican who smells like lice medication ( in some instances of our current time some kids don't even have toothpaste , so one can hastily imagine that this could be an analogy as well ). The boy is forced to move in with a stationary migrant couple who are bootleggers and even conspired the murder of another migrant worker. The movie also conveys that there were caucasian people who sympathized with some of the racist attitudes of the mid western farm belts. It was great to see this because all too often some movies are motivational factors towards more hate and reverse discrimination. My self , I need a re-affirmations in movies which tell the story of caucasians or Schindlers who harbor in their hearts some sort of sympathy factor. This movie has many funny scenes as well.",1268006400,,1263,4.693693693693693

8295901,1,B001E1821I,"This is not a movie to show in school. My classes are studying the life of Mexican migrant workers. I showed it to my class without previewing it based on the recommendations of other teachers on Amazon. I had to switch it off when the scene featuring THE PASTOR AND HIS WIFE HAVING SEX IN THE TRAILER came on!!
