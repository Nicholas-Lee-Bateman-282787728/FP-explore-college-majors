2799480,5,B000OU5NLW,The storyline is so original and the characters are played brilliantly by Vera Famiga and Nick Stahl. This film speaks for itself. Quid Pro Quo is definitely one of a kind. A magnificent film.,1260057600,2,192,4.676470588235294
2799481,5,B000OU5NLW,"this is a smart little independent film noir, quite the intriguing mystery. the script is excellent and the direction/pacing is fine. the female lead, vera farmiga, is very good. nick stahl, the male lead, is incredible in this role. he gives a fine,fine performance and captures the confusion and hopes/fears of the character very well. this actor deserves more recognition than he gets. he is attractive-but-vulnerable and has a real film presence.",1242518400,9,450,5.263888888888889
2799482,5,B000OU5NLW,"I bought this DVD because the HBO series Carnivale made me a Nick Stahl fan. I always find Nick's acting impressive; but I think this is the best of his recent films, and should have had a wide theatrical release. It's an offbeat, thought-provoking story (though not a ""psychological thriller,"" as it's been misleadingly described).

In my purely personal opinion, the ""deleted scenes"" on the DVD should have been included in the film. I find myself wondering if their not having been included made the difference in someone's deciding whether to give it that wide theatrical release.

Another purely personal opinion: I found Vera Farmiga less interesting than Nick and the actress playing the young woman with whom he'd been in love. Most of that actress's role wound up in the ""deleted scenes.""",1240099200,5,797,4.984962406015038
2799483,4,B000OU5NLW,"Helpful Note: Wikipedia definition:  Quid pro quo (Latin for ""something for something"") indicates a more-or-less equal exchange or substitution of goods or services.

Carlos Brooks makes an impressive debut as both writer and director of this little independent film QUID PRO QUO, a story that may make some viewers uncomfortable because of the subject matter, but an intelligent investigation of a subculture unknown to most and a script that leads to a surprising ending - if the viewer keeps thinking after the rolling credits are over!

Isaac (Nick Stahl) is a reporter for a small radio station, a role that gives him the opportunity to uncover novel human interest stories for his audience.  Interestingly, Isaac is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents.  He has full function of most of his body, but cannot walk.  Isaac receives an email from one 'Ancient Chinese Girl' that contains a message about a person who convinced a doctor to amputate a normal leg. Isaac is fascinated and sets out to investigate the story and eventually discovers the source of the email - one young and very beautiful Fiona (Vera Farmiga) - who introduces him to a subculture of people who want to be wheelchair bound: in a group meeting Isaac hears strange stories from a disparate group of people who meet to discuss their obsession with being paralyzed, their chance to be noticed and cared about as quasi-invalids who would go so far as having an amputation of a normal limb to enable their wheelchair dreams.

Isaac soon discovers that Fiona shares this obsession, demonstrates her secrets to Isaac, and the two begin to bond physically and emotionally.  Isaac is the first person to see Fiona make her 'debut' in public in a wheelchair.  They share lunch in a caf&eacute; and  share their life experiences: Isaac confesses that he harbors foreshortened memory of his accident - his last memory is lying in the road seeing a young girl with red and white pompoms trying to save him.  Isaac surprises himself (and shares his surprise with Fiona) when he buys a pair of 'Fred Astaire shoes', and upon trying them on, he is able to walk!  Fiona's response is mixed - she is happy that Isaac is ambulatory but at the same time she is led to believe that Isaac's paralysis may be of an hysterical nature, that he really has never been paralyzed except as a reaction to the guilt he harbors about his parent's death and his sole survivorship of the accident.  How these two people deal with the information as it develops provides a startling ending to this story, a detective mystery that in retrospect proves to have given us, the audience, countless clues throughout the film - clues only discovered in retrospect!

Both Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga give vital performances, able to draw us in to their odd characters and make us care.  There are many fine cameo roles - Kate Burton as Fiona's mother, James Frain as Isaac's priest friend, and all the members of the wannabe wheelchair bound group - and the cinematography by Michael McDonough is both appropriately claustrophobic indoors and transcendently beautiful in the tulip fields of Skagit Valley, WA used as the setting for the upstate New York accident location.  Mark Mothersbaugh ties the moods of the film together with his expert musical score.  This is a tough little film to watch, but a film that supplies much gratification and challenge.  It is a fine debut for Carlos Brooks. Recommended.  Grady Harp, August 08",1220140800,14,3550,4.8283828382838285
2799484,3,B000OU5NLW,"This film keeps getting the trailer and media exposure of being another Crash-esque (1995) style film with a serious coverage of psychotic ""wannabes"" that wish for physical/medical impairments. And it almost appears  that way in the beginning, but as you make it through all of those uncomfortable sexual moments what transpires is another come-to-terms film of emotional withholdings.

Vera Farmiga and Nich Stahl lead this film of exploration and in the end, twists of forgiveness and moving forward. Vera's performance was forced and seemed on fast forward at times, but she still looks elegant on the screen. Nick appears to be creating a name for himself so I would recommend the film especially for his fan base.

Technically, the intermittent flashbacks of tulip fields and the opening color montage during the credits would make for a great Blu display, but the remainder of the film is mostly filled with browns, silvers and darks. The DVD contains footage from the Whole documentary, deleted scenes, a tulip montage to some nice music, and most importantly - the alternate ending that was significantly better. Several ladies were watching this with me and they felt the film was ruined with the corny ending that is in the film now, but the alternate was much more appropriate and gave the whole (deleted) love story much needed closure.

I have noticed in other reviews that any topics touching the disabilities, psychosis, or challenges shown in the film spur ugly debates. Putting all of that aside, it is a watchable film with a good twist ending that should keep the masses slightly entertained.",1219017600,14,1611,5.045112781954887
2799485,1,B000OU5NLW,"Did not watch it, as it failed streaming.  Not sure why my I keep loosing Wi-Fi.  I give up watching when it fails often.

2799486,4,B000OU5NLW,"Excellent acting. Shocking story, and I have traveled in many circles. But oddly, and moreover scarily -- I get it, I really get it.

Kinda heartbreaking, as many of us get things stuck in our heads. Made me rethink everything I have in my brain that I think I really feel is true, or real.

I do know that our brains lie to us all the time. Our brains lie to us about people, places and things, which is why eyewitness is considered not dependable. Four people can see the same event and all have a different story.",1355270400,,516,4.255102040816326
2799487,5,B000OU5NLW,"I was first intrigued about the condition described in the movie and I thought it was just fiction. Then I did a search about people who WANT to be amputees. Yes, really unusual, but I came across real people, and a real condition. I read about a guy who is a chemist and he put both his legs in dry ice for six hours until the tissue died and had to have both legs amputated. So IT IS a real condition that makes psychiatrists scratch their heads! There are a bunch of people with this condition out there.

The movie is surprisingly good. The end is totally not predictable and jaw dropping. The acting as far as Vera Farmiga is concerned is outstanding. Nick Stahl is OK, not very convincing as a paraplegic.

Briefly, Isaac, a journalist is a paraplegic that was in a car accident when he was young and his parents died. Somebody sends him messages about a group of people that pretend being paraplegic. After several emails, he meets the person (Fiona) and there is a little bit of a love story for a while. The bizarre turning point of the movie is when he buys a pair of shoes that allows him to walk again. At first it looks out of place but...I will stop here! I don't want to give more of the movie up. Just remember, it is not a science fiction movie.

At the very end of the movie we understand what is going on and the reason that both Fiona and Isaac feel bad in their life and what kind of baggage they are carrying. Highly recommended if you like to be surprised at the very end of a movie! Five stars all around for a very interesting movie.

Just a note to the person who cut several scenes shown under deleted scenes. Huge mistake! All deleted scenes belong in the movie. Why taking them out?",1347148800,2,1711,4.271604938271605
2799488,4,B000OU5NLW,"This is a movie you do not want any spoilers or plot summary.  It's a rare that a person in a wheelchair can be honestly portrayed as neither bitter nor heroic.  Even rarer is a woman who enters his life for her own reasons.  There's not so much a twist ending as a gradual unfolding of where each of them is coming from.  It's slightly like the 1996 ""Crash"" but more literal.  Be sure to watch ALL the extras.",1344211200,,410,4.139240506329114
2799489,3,B000OU5NLW,"I didn't see any marketing for Quid Pro Quo but the sense I get is that it suggested more sexiness than storyline...that would be consistent with what I saw in the film.

Beautifully shot and lovingly-made, QPQ needed a Cronenberg/Lynch/King injection to provide a creepier edge to push it up to 4 stars. Nick Stahl of Carnival did his part and Vera Farmiga was much more than eye-candy with her twisted performance. For a real treat, watch her audition in the Special Features and see her emote without all the trappings of the set - smokin'!!!",1339632000,,545,4.677083333333333
2799490,3,B000OU5NLW,"No spoilers here.  I won't go into the plot.  It could have been and should have been a 5 star movie and if they would not have deleted the scenes that they did then i would have given this film 5 stars, no sweat.  But the deleted scenes were more important than the mess of a movie at the end.  As far as I am concerned, they threw away the essential ingredients to make the whole thing work.  What is the viewer supposed to be - a mind reader?",1332979200,,445,3.955056179775281
2799491,4,B000OU5NLW,"A very interesting and somewhat unique concept/subject.  Very thought provoking and at times a little unnerving.  Definetly a movie I am glad I own and have in my collection.

Set on the very fringes of underground society, Carlos Brooks' ""Quid Pro Quo"" is a humane and compassionate tale of non-handicapped people who have a pathological obsession with becoming either partially or totally disabled (or at least living their lives as if they were).  In the most extreme cases, some will even go so far as to stage accidents, endure amputations or employ special drugs to turn their fantasy into reality.  And, like anyone who's harboring a deep, dark secret from a critical world, these people are forced to live their lives in the closet, terrified that they will be rejected by those they care most about if they reveal the truth of who they really are inside.

Isaac Knott (Nick Stahl) has been a paraplegic since he was a teen, the result of a car accident in which both his parents were killed.  He's now a reporter for a local radio station and it is through an assignment for his work that he meets a group of able-bodied ""wannabes,"" as well as an attractive young woman named Fiona (Vera Farmiga from ""Up in the Air"") who desperately wants to live life in a wheelchair and implores Isaac to help her achieve that goal.

This quiet and gentle, though emotionally complex, film rises above its potentially tricky subject matter through insightful performances, sensitive writing, and a plot that nicely dovetails into itself in the second half.  We discover that there's a great deal more to both Isaac and Fiona and their relationship than initially meets the eye, and those revelations go a long way towards deepening the theme and enhancing the characters.",1285891200,4,1598,4.831501831501831
2799493,5,B000OU5NLW,"I just finished watching the movie. Well... I didn't expect that kind of story at all. I was really surprised. It's a very good drama, very touching. And a good psychological study. But definitely not a typical drama. The story is indescribable. You have to watch it to really understand what it is all about. I found myself wondering what I was watching, where it was gonna lead, how it would end, what would be the final twist. I think ""surprising"" is the most fitting word to describe this movie. But surprising in a good way, I really liked it. Two thumbs up for Vera Farmiga. Her performance is oscar-worthy. Nick Stahl's performance was very believable and touching as well. I actually watched the movie only because he starred in it. And I'm not disappointed. This movie really deserves more praise than it got. It's a jewel of a movie.",1269302400,3,843,4.626666666666667
2799494,4,B000OU5NLW,"This film continued to surprise me and it seems that any time I have found a motion picture in which Nick Stahl has appeared, the film has been entertaining. Mr. Stahl, from ""The Man Without A Face"" to his great work in ""Carnivale"" is one of Hollywood's finest talented actors. This film has you immediately interested in the main character, who is wheelchair-bound, and then brings in a character that one might find difficult to sympathize with, as she is able to manipulate the audience - at least for a time. A fine film.",1260316800,2,525,4.595744680851064

8186658,4,B000OU5NLW,"Brilliant script.  Great set-up: investigative reporter type, confined to a wheel chair, works and loves....  Then it gets rather wonderfully weird.

8186659,4,B000OU5NLW,"""Quid pro quo, Clarice.""  OK, so maybe Vera Farmiga -- who gives a very nice performance, as usual -- maybe isn't quite as off her rocker here as Hannibal Lecter, but it's close.  She seems to want something that no one should want.

Pretty early on in this mildly-disturbing film, I started thinking about why a parapalegic would take offense if a non-disabled person wanted to become wheelchair bound.  It didn't take long to think about this, and I came up with the following most-likely truth:  the able-bodied person is trivializing the struggles that the parapalegic endures by thinking this way.  If the parapalegic could have his way, he'd be out of that wheelchair faster than you can say, ""Lickety split.""

And this is the psychological setup for the film ""Quid Pro Quo,"" at least for the audience, or at least for me.  I have heard about actual people who want to become disabled for no apparent reason.  For real, there was this guy who went to the doctor to ask to have one of his legs removed, below the knee, and there was nothing wrong with the patient's leg.  The doctor correctly refused.  Later, the patient wanted it gone so bad he put his foot in a bucket of dry ice, and gangrene set it.  The doctor then had no choice but to remove it.  The patient got his way, I suppose.

But this film has another possible theme going on.  Is it possible that one person could start walking if another person lost the ability to walk?  And would it be fair play if someone that did someone else harm receive a similar punishment?  Would it make everything ""square?""

This film is surely not for everyone; some people will undoubtedly be turned off or offended I suppose.  But very nice performances by the leads leads us to a pretty thought-provoking film.  And a fairly strong recommendation by me.",1363996800,3,1808,4.590625
