1903665,5,B0000A5BW1,"I have been a triathlete/marathoner for 7 years, going 8. I found these series from the Navy Seals workout really are of exceptional values fitting the type of activities that I do. If you do care about the sleekness of the production, this is not for you. But if all you care about is real, sweaty hard work, no commercial productions are comparable. Fads will evaporate, values stay. Despite the crassness of Caracci, the exercises are basic and effective. No weights required, and I have gained both strength and speed using these DVDs.",1193616000,3,539,4.806451612903226
1903666,5,B0000A5BW1,"From close up crotch shots to exercising with a combat knife in hand, this video has it all - except for an actual workout. I watched this with a group of people hungover and none of us has ever laughed so hard in our lives. The camera work looks to be done by someone who just bought a VHS camera for the first time. The backround machine guns are also hysterical. The guy in the video is priceless - from his belch where he had to say ""excuse me"" to doing pullups on a childhood playset to the even more ridiculous line when he was doing arm circles - ""ya know what's funner than this?...NOTHING!"". There is even a scene where it looks like he has a bra on because of the camera work. Actually, the entire thing reminds me of Ben Stiller in DODGEBALL. He must have based the character off this guy or something.

I think I burned alot of calories just laughing at this video nonstop. The exercises are just basic stretching and pushups. Unless you are looking for comedy, do not buy this. HOwever, I rated this 5 stars because I think everyone should own this.",1182038400,4,1062,4.31
1903667,3,B0000A5BW1,"In this DVD, C.J. Caracci guides you through an intermediate level workout. The workout is not very fast paced, as Caracchi explains every move, giving you a brief rest between exercises. As this workout is intended for Real Men, there is no dancing moves or jumping around involved, and they use machine guns, parachutes and the like as props to give you the ""authentic Navy SEAL feeling"" during the workout.
The workout consists mostly of jumping jacks, push ups, abdominal work and stretching. The film gives you a very good workout, but there would have been room for more variety of exercises. Most of the exercises are probably familiar to you from PT classes at school, and you don't need any exercise equipment to run through this workout. Along with physical exercises, Caracci gives you some pointers on mental toughness as well.
The production of the film is pretty OK. There is nothing special, but everything works just fine.",1085356800,6,938,4.90566037735849
1903668,5,B0000A5BW1,"If you are looking to get into good physical condition, I highly recommend this video. Caracci doesn't just lead you through the workout, he motivates you to push your limits, physically and mentally, so that you will become both stronger and mentally tougher. If you are already in good physical condition and are looking for an even greater challenge, get Caracci's Navy SEAL Burnout PT Challenge instead.",1074643200,5,407,5.08955223880597

7996123,1,B0000A5BW1,"It is a group of no organized exercises.  In addition,  Caracci no motivate you at all.  It is absolutely boring.  The Navy SEALs Workout and Special Ops Fitness  Navy SEAL Workout, System 1 of Mark De Lisle are great callisthenic workouts.",1391644800,,240,4.7560975609756095
7996124,4,B0000A5BW1,"I purchased this video because I wanted something challenging to do at home on the days when I don't have time to go to the gym. The dudes pic on the front was pretty much a major selling point.

Some things you should know if you're considering ordering this dvd. The actual routine was filmed on a basic home camcorder in what looks like 1989. Just because its transfered to dvd does not make it ""dvd quality."" But if you're a no-nonsense dude like me, that really won't matter, as content is what you're really after.

I would say overall, I like this workout video. It runs about 50 minutes or so. It's set at about a medium to slow pacing. This got to be mildly irritating after the first watching of it, as there is two to three minutes banter before almost all the excersises. Another thing I liked was that this is a very well rounded fitness routine. It's not just push ups. Theres three or four sets of thirty. But they're spaced out enough to allow you to recover. The host is great! Total goof but probably could kill you. Very likeable. Great mix of stretching and calisthenics. Your abs and chest and legs WILL definitely be sore. I would consider myself to be in pretty good shape overall, and I found this video to be about a 6 out of 10 on the difficulty scale. C.J. calls out the excercise and counts for you, which is GREAT so you don't have to be constantly watching the screen. You can just concentrate on doing the excercises. Very motivational and helpful.

I would say the biggest downside to the video is the slow pacing. If you just wanna pop in a video and get to movin', this video, while an effective workout, will not satisfy those of you who are impatient and have to be moving alot. Unless you're in one of those chill moods. If, however, you enjoy taking things at a slower pace, you may enjoy the pace.

I did like the overall workout routines and the host, and I even ordered his next workout dvd which I read does without the instruction. So, overall, if you are used to doing military type bootcamp excercises and are already in pretty good shape, this dvd might be kinda slow for you.

Overall, satisfied with purchase. Satisfied with results.

The special feature about BUD/s was pretty ok to watch.",1353888000,3,2238,4.4330900243309
7996125,5,B0000A5BW1,"I'm a 30 year old female. I consider myself to be an ""intermediate"" exerciser. Despite what others have said, this is actually a really good workout.  the guy is very motivating, and makes you feel like your a NAVY SEAL in training.  who cares if the production quality is low, its still a good workout & the guy does inspire you.",1291939200,,330,4.39344262295082
7996126,1,B0000A5BW1,"All this is is one guy (yes, one) doing his exercises in front of a cheap video camera (or did he film it on his camera phone?). Let me save you 30$ with this tip: do a lot of pushups. That's all that you will get from this dvd. Oh, and the guy must have had a big accident during the filming. He has a bloody, scraped thigh during the second half of the workout.",1245024000,3,363,3.8533333333333335
7996127,5,B0000A5BW1,I thought this was a great workout for anyone that is in the military or who wants to join. It is a little tough for beginners.,1211673600,,127,3.923076923076923
