8679731,1,B00NPYKTBI,"I have been a Willie fan for the bigger part of my 75 years & have a huge collection of everything Willie.
This DVD is utter rubbish - abysmal quality - nothing new -  do not buy - there's better on YouTube!
If it were possible to leave no stars I would.
Save your cash & buy one of his latest CD albums - Band of Brothers is excellent.",1418860800,6,336,3.869565217391304
8679732,1,B00NPYKTBI,I love Willie but save your money it's very poor quality and the videos / songs have been released on other DVD's. I buy anything Willie but this was a major disappoint. The interview at the end is some reporter talking to him about his role in the dukes of hazzard movie.,1418256000,6,272,4.25
