7996598,5,B0000ACOY1,"I have twin almost 4 year old girls and this was perfect for them.  All three stories are reasonably short (I don't like to park them in front of the TV for too long).  The stories all have girl heros who are capable and loving--for example Cinderella forgives her step sisters and finds them good husbands.  All three heroines marry a prince--which I know some people don't like, but it doesn't bother me.  The music is terrific and the lyrics are lovely.  The animation is low end, also something that doesn't bother me.",1075248000,10,522,4.56989247311828
