4119117,1,B003FSTV9K,"I watched this movie with high hopes of getting to see God in this documentary.  You'd think that if the producers were serious about this film they would at least get an interview with the main subject.  Alas, God is nowhere to be found, as is always the case.  Oh God, wherefore art thou?  He must demand royalties that are of the highest sum.",1359676800,10,345,4.34375
4119118,4,B003FSTV9K,"I chose this rating because it presentation and how it fall all into place.
How science proves the existence of a creator.",1358899200,2,122,4.590909090909091
4119119,5,B003FSTV9K,"This movie was great! Our Earth is so complex, its a beautiful self-regulating machine. This movie brings a whole knew appreciation for this wonderful life-giving planet!",1356134400,3,170,5.576923076923077
4119120,4,B003FSTV9K,"These presentations by the Moody Institute were made quite a few years ago (the date is not specified on the DVD) but the science is timeless. Christians who are serious about their faith will especially appreciate them, but anyone who would like to see the evidence for intelligent design will find them fascinating as well. The cameos by NASA astronaut Col. Gardner are also very compelling. The only small disappointment for me was the modest video quality, presumably because of the age of the original production.",1274745600,7,518,5.034883720930233
4119131,4,B003FSTV9K,"Although the video was older, I found it enjoyable and loved the detail it went into about nature. I will probably watch it again.",1453852800,,130,4.458333333333333
4119132,5,B003FSTV9K,"So thankful for a scientific documentary that gives God the glory for this awesome creation of his. It is filled with fascinating facts and scenes of the world, which rightly lead to worship the Creator, not the creation (as so many other secular documentaries do). Valuable resource for homeschooling, and will fill you with praise to our God.",1453766400,2,344,4.948275862068965

4119134,5,B003FSTV9K,Great information.,1434412800,,18,8.5
4119135,1,B003FSTV9K,It's sad that this is labeled science and that an unassuming child could watch this and grow up thinking this is fact. This is complete and utter garbage.,1431734400,5,154,4.535714285714286
4119136,5,B003FSTV9K,"We LOVE this series! As a youngster, my family had a boxed VHS set of Planet Earth, Animal Kingdom, & Human Life. I watched those over and over until I can now have it playing in the TV room and know exactly what is happening when my kids make comments & I am out of the room. This is a great series for homeschoolers!",1424563200,5,318,3.984375
4119137,1,B003FSTV9K,"Not what I thought,  religious based and poor video quality.",1420243200,6,60,5.0

4119139,4,B003FSTV9K,"I've seen lots of nature shows, each one is a little different.  This one had some things (sorry about my failing memory) I hadn't seen before.  It has wonderful photography, slow motion movies of flowers unfolding, seeds growing, animals & plants.  We live on a wonderful planet, & this is just a nice, fairly short movie that is enjoyable, entertaining, & educational all at the same time.  Earth is not some evolutionary accident in the cosmos.  The more you see of the intricacies of earth, you know none if could have happened by chance.  We should each appreciate the beauty around us, in everything from the grandeur of sunsets, oceans, mountain views, to the tiniest insects working in our gardens & yards.  Stop to watch a bee in a flower; a marvel no man can create.",1418169600,3,776,4.661764705882353
4119140,5,B003FSTV9K,EVILution did not 'create' this! How can a non-entity create? Where did the CODE in DNA come from? Where did the mathematics come from? God! That's who!,1415836800,3,152,4.666666666666667

4119153,4,B003FSTV9K,"A really enjoyable movie that combines scientific fact with Biblical teachings. Since a large proportion of scientific theory, or hypothesis, are no more provable (have not been tested, can not be repeated) than the stories in the Bible, this film should have equal time in the classroom as evolution.",1405209600,3,301,5.163265306122449

4119157,5,B003FSTV9K,"Intelligent design is irrefutable.  It's astonishing to note the great lengths many atheists go in desperate attempt to disprove existence of a God.  It takes far more faith to entertain such alternate theories!  Excellent film ...& it's never old or outdated ...creation science has been known since mankind received the Book of Genesis about 6,000 years ago & unlike alternate theories of how the earth came to be, creation science hasn't changed ..evolved.. or adapted.  The more we learn & explore .. the more the evidence points to the biblical model and that's because it's correct! Awesome video!",1385251200,3,603,5.122448979591836
4119158,5,B003FSTV9K,"Amazing production of the beauty and complexity of the earth and much of the life therein. Some parts were a little drawn out, but for the most part fascinating, entertaining, and uplifting! Although older, this film is full of breathtaking imagery, informative presentation, and a huge variety of beautiful landscapes and scenery. A documentary showing how impossible an Earth without God truly is!",1385251200,,399,5.349206349206349

Only God could create such beauty and meaning of the world around us.

8396129,4,B003FSTV9K,"Except for the mention of planets, the NASA mission to the moon and other barbarities, including the misleading Astronaut contribution; this initiative is an excellent analysis of the role of seeds and water in our life and the balanced conception by God of our beautiful planet that makes it unique on design and a gift of life and perfection.",1464652800,,344,4.8474576271186445
