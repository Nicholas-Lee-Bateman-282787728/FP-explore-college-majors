My friend and I have a goal to meet Leonardo DiCaprio before we turn 20 years old. We are also becoming actresses so we can be in good movies like Romeo & Juliet!

I was so badly wanting to watch it again, and had sold my DVD because I was going to go over to Blu Ray anyway. So, I finally decided I had to buy it on Blu Ray, and was glad there wasn't anything wrong with it. I love it still just as I remember from middle school. Leo was very hot in the movie as well. But, I would highly recommend this movie especially to any woman who is into Leonardo Dicaprio! There may be some guys may like the movie. But, it has some action and of course romance, even some humor in it. Even though tragedy is what always happens in this story, which is the sad thing. It is a different way to end it though, so at least it would be less painful than the original Romeo and Juliet with knifes. All in all, it has great music which I want to buy the mp3's to now, and a very great movie that I was able to watch many many times and still am not sick of!!!!",1502755200,,952,3.9123711340206184

856924,4,630438551X,"The only version of Romeo and Juliet that my teenaged son actually enjoyed and wanted to sit through to the very end. As R&J is required reading in most high school English classes take that as a recommendation to make the story come to life before they must read it - but do be aware there is one scene of some nudity and the theme is of course, gang war and so there is violence and action - but that is the story. I do not at all recommended this version for middle school students though.",1497225600,,492,4.135416666666667

856931,1,630438551X,"This is a fantastic movie to show students as a companion to the original Romeo and Juliet play.  While it may feel campy and very 90s, the use of music and emotion communicates a very clear story that even students who have trouble understanding R+J will be able to understand.  The problem with this movie is that the sound quality from Amazon's end is so poor that I am unable to show the movie in my class.  Ambient sounds such as our custodial staff cutting grass outside or the air conditioner's hum completely drown out dialogue.  We utilize media from the smart board at various times through the year and have never had issues with sound quality so this is not an issue of my classrooms audio equipment or acoustics in my room.  Purchasing this movie was the first time that I have used Amazon prime and will not use it again until they resolve their streaming audio issues.  I see that Amazon has a still-active customer discussion board dating all the way back to 2014 with people frustrated by the audio quality of their media purchases.",1494806400,,1049,4.5828877005347595
857027,1,630438551X,"The blu ray itself is fine, good quality etc. However the movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have seen in my entire life. I cannot recommend anyone watch this, let alone purchase it for themselves.",1493942400,,206,4.3076923076923075
857028,5,630438551X,"When I saw Romeo & Juliet in the theatre -- on its opening weekend -- after the film in the lobby I saw dozens of teenaged girls sobbing in each other's arms.  I've never seen anything like that before or since.  That alone marks the film as a masterpiece, and nothing any critic can say is relevant next to that emotional reaction.  Those sobbing teenagers are absolute proof that any critic who panned this film is a fool.

Di'Caprio wasn't very famous at that point (though I believe he'd already been nominated for an oscar for an indy film).  Later that night, I had dinner with friends and predicted that this boy would become the biggest star in Hollywood -- by tomorrow!  I was off by a couple of years.  Rare in film history has there been such a perfect casting -- Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo.  The mythical balcony scene is freshly designed and executed wonderfully, bringing the myth to life before our eyes.  But the crowning glory and superpower of this film is the 'love at first sight' scene - ironic in that there are no words spoken (words being Shakespeare's superpower).  It's all done with the eyes by the two young genius actors, combined with inspired camera work and the devastating vocal performance of Des'ree.  This is one of the most beautiful, greatest, and most powerful scenes in cinematic  history.

What is this emotion -- love at first sight?  It might only happen two or three times in our entire lives.  It isn't real love.  So is it just trivial, adolescent silliness?  I think it is much more than that -- and so did Shakespeare.  What is our emotional relationship with our desires that can never be?  We're haunted forever by the impossiblity of perfect love as much as we were ever thrilled by the fantasy of it.  Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo & Juliet' taps deeply into the impossible longings that never leave us.  It is a masterpiece.",1493942400,11,1869,4.620060790273556

It could have turned out worse, If the disk had broken. Luckily, As I watch it, It is fine. I'd prefer the case to be in tact more, But I'm happy it came at all. It was supposed to be two day shipping, And it took nearly two weeks! I'm not buying from their company again, Not when they promise two days.",1492819200,,453,4.044444444444444
857031,5,630438551X,"As a film and literature teacher, I love this movie. The dialogue is the most accurate of all the Romeo and Juliet film adaptations; although sometimes the lines are spoken by characters who do not originally speak those lines. This version does a fantastic job of using symbolism to express the main themes of the play; it is visible in almost all aspects, from color to music. The archetypes present also help students to understand the thematic implications of the story itself. Students are usually mostly divided as to whether or not they like the film, but when used to accent the play, this version helps to fill in gaps in student knowledge by making it more visible on the screen. What's more, the cinematography of Baz Luhrmann is so uniquely stylistic that I devote an entire unit in my film as literature class to him as a director and producer. Even if you do not like Shakespeare, or even this film; the educational benefits are numerous.",1491350400,,952,4.706586826347305

Only one complaint - the subtitles for the balcony scene added a comma in the most important line: Wherefore art thou Romeo? (They say, ""Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"") Wherefore means WHY, not WHERE. I hammered that into my students and here came the subtitles to undermine me.

You can get the general idea though, I watched this when it first came out about 20 years ago, and I LOVED it; even with the wording. The acting was pretty bad by most the actors, apart from Claire Danes, the parents, Tybalt and Mercutio. Yet it sucked me in; the story is just awesome.

My students love this version and it keeps their attention with the fast-paced plot, colorful scenes, and flashy costumes.  However, this edition is the NEW Music edition of the DVD, so there are added bonuses to this new disc.  The music edition features a 45 minute documentary of how they picked the songs that were used in the movie.  Twenty years after this film came out, my students are still singing along with some of the songs--they were the perfect choices and were timeless songs (and hey, if my students know Prince's ""When the Doves Cry"" more than 30 years after the song's initial release, yes, it is timeless).

My DVD did not look like the photo (the cover is a bit different, although it does say ""Music Edition"") but I bought it for the movie and not for the cover.  If you are a fan of this version of the movie and you don't have the music edition, you need this one.

858357,1,630438551X,"I was made to watch this in my first year of high school several years ago since we were reading this specific Shakespearean tale. Unlike West Side Story, which I found had more originality and heart to it's story, I wasn't really impressed with this film.

This adaptation of Romeo & Juliet takes place in modern day, but did they try to modernize Shakespeare's text for the audience? No. Did they TRY to do something different with this movie - aside from it taking place in the 20th century and the main characters' family as rivaled gangs - that wouldn't make this any different from other remakes in the past...? Again, the answer is No!

Many people claim that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the ""ultimate love story"", I wasn't impressed with all the love at first site crud, and it's not believable as a love story with all of Romeo and Juliet's stupid decisions; the Twilight franchise wasn't any different from this in my opinion.

858434,5,630438551X,"I would have to say that I would give the 1997 version a five star rating because as a teen if there is enough action in the movie to keep a teen into it. Some people may not like the gun fights in the film. It starts off about as boring as the 1968 but then it starts getting more action as soon as the Montagues and the Capulets meet at the gas station. Franco Zeffirelli could not have made the film in 1968 and then he had to put the sex scene in there and it caught all of the kids in my class by surprise. And with the 97 version it also will catch the eyes of the teens with the actors of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes and also with the older cars in the film. Also in this film it just gives you the idea of the sex scene it does not hold it out like in Zeffirelli's film, i mean come on guys I think we get the point. In this film it also uses guns and not swords and its acting was teen times better. Zeffirellis film had acting that was worse than opening a bag of potato chips and finding more air than chips in the bag. The only thing i would probably change is the nurse in the film. The nurse in the newer version is so much cheesier than the older one. But all in all this is the better film to watch!",1457654400,,1222,3.8531746031746033
858435,5,630438551X,"The 68 version by Franco Zeffirelli vs. the 97 version by Baz Luhrmann was a huge jump in action and suspense. The time periods separated the movies both in technology and acting. Leonardo Dicaprio as Romeo and Olivia Hussey as Juliet. Of course as time trudged on, so did the filming and movie technology they used to produce original movies. The 97 version obtained a more gangland kind of setting in a California/ Florida beach like place. The actors have a more hispanic look mixed with gang appearance. The 97 version is more entertaining and faster pace. It has music that arouses your thrill and stimulates your mind. The filming is better and has that hollywood sex appeal with loud and fast muscle cars. There is a sex scene that is longer than the 68 version but there is no nudity to where the 68 version had nudity but a less longer sex scene. There just happens to be a police chase with gunfire. The ending is more interesting in my opinion compared to the 68 version. Also, the 68 version used swords, it had no music and it was just plain boring to me. There is some nudity like a male rear end and some breasts but its like 10 seconds long. The slang the characters use are the same and so are the names of the characters. The 97 version was an exciting remake to the 68 version. An exhilarating movie that incorporates the old story of Romeo and Juliet.",1457568000,,1371,4.444444444444445

858439,1,630438551X,"Romeo and Juliet directed by Baz Luhrmann (1997) was awful. The only good part of the movie was Leonardo. I can't explain how tremendously bad this movie was. this movie was so bad because they turned such a remarkable play into something so unpleasant. I felt like Baz tried to hard to make it realistic, when it wasn't at all. It was poorly directed and barely even reminded me of the actual play. In the movie there is way too much going on at once. It was hard to even pay attention.  Shakespeare would be ashamed if he saw what Baz had done to his masterpiece. The movie didn't even fulfill shakespeare's vision. Baz should be humiliated  for the crappy work he did.  I don't suggest that you watch this movie. I felt like Romeo and Juliet didn't actually love each other in the movie. I could tell they were acting. It actually was very frustrating. This is a movie that tries to hard to be good, when it actually makes it even worse. The pool scene could've definitely been left out. It was a little too much for my eyes to handle. Not realistic at all, and I didn't even feel like I was watching something that shakespeare wrote.

858440,4,630438551X,"This is an exquisite movie. It had its highs and lows throughout the entire movie. There was conflict, heart throbbing romance, and an edgy experience. It had me interested in majority of the movie even though there were some parts where I was a little bored or thought it was cheesy. I think that Leo was an amazing actor having the audience feeling every single emotion that he felt. If he cried the audience was feeling that, when he was happy it gave me a fuzzy feeling making me in a good mood as well. I loved the feud with the families in the worst way. Their fights made me hate them in the worst way because they hated each other so much that it left you on your toes all the time wondering who was going to get it through their head that the feud had gone on long enough. I loved it!! Juliet played by Claire Danes was an amazing actress. I loved how much emotion that she put in her acting as well. I could feel the tempting love that she had for Romeo and the sparks they had looking through the fish tank like a wall separating them from everything except each other's gaze. There were parts that I loved but hated with a passion like when she woke up just as romeo killed himself with the poison of his pain. I loved that they used the dialogue of Shakespeare even though it took place in a modern setting. It also had some hilarious parts!

858913,3,630438551X,"I saw it for a Language Arts class. The movie is good, and they do a good job with the background effects and drama. It does have three MAJOR problems that make it bad.
1. The acting. It's AWFUL. It comes off as extremely cheesy and campy. I feel like they tried too hard to exaggerate some of the action scenes.
2. Luhrmann (the director) made the idiotic choice of not modernizing the dialogue. You could read this alongside the Shakespeare play script, and 98% of the words will be identical to the book. The dialogue in the play is hard to read, and this is amplified to astronomical levels in the movie if you don't have subtitles on. And even then, it's still hard to understand. If the director is going to spend thousands of dollars on elaborate sets, can't he spend the hundred dollars it would take to hire someone to modernize the script? It does not mesh well with the somewhat modern setting AT ALL.
3. Luhrmann made NO effort to make the story less confusing. I think he may have made it more confusing, actually.
In conclusion, only watch this if you know what you're getting into, and have read the play at LEAST once.",1445904000,,1134,4.430622009569378

859266,5,630438551X,"If you've ever thought The Bard's plays were stuffy, the language cluttered and difficult to understand, your enjoyment is within reach! This is a modernized version of Romeo and Juliet, ala' Westside Story. While the language of the original is intact, the film itself is pretty alternate universe. The characters are often exaggerated, but bear with the stylized representation, because Romeo and Juliet are sincere and touching. The reason I tell you right off that the depiction is unusual is that I think you'll enjoy it best if you understand that going in... no, you haven't gotten the wrong movie by mistake, bear with it, it's worth it. Leonardo Di Caprio is amazing, even if you don't like him in other things, he is worthy of praise here! What I'm trying to say is that, amazingly, he is able to perform this role, with the original wording, in such a believably conversant way that the emotion is left intact and what he's saying doesn't seem awkward to me. Of course it's a romance, and he is very believably as brooding, intense and obsessive as only a teenage boy stricken by adoration can be. His is not the only wonderful performance, of course, Juliet was lovely and sweet, his best friend is wild and fantastic, the priest... but Romeo is a very strong role.

But it does stick to the plot WAY better than the 2013 version, and clearly it doesn't hurt to look at the beautiful and young Leo. I do like teaching this version to my students, only because Shakespeare wrote the play as a violent, hormonal and sexual play, which this film interprets well. I know the characters use guns and aren't the best actors (Sometimes I cringe when they say some lines more ""modernly""), but I like the feel for the movie. It's beneficial when trying to learn about ""rash actions"" and ""not thinking with the little man downstairs"".

The Catholic icons present in almost every scene, the Virgin Mary primarily, he juxtaposes the hopeful forgiveness of the sinner and the violence and hatred of the Montagues and Capulets. It is hard to not think of Leonardo as the Romeo...he has an ability to use his face, voice and actions to make you believe he IS Romeo. Luhrmann's successfully shows why and how Romeo is the tragic hero.

860818,4,630438551X,"Outstanding! There is very little wrong with this movie. Maybe the best use of music of any movie of my lifetime. I thought the campy-frenetic energy worked rather brilliantly with the somewhat ""foreign""/awkward Shakespearian wording. I think it matched the tone of the language very well. Hearing Shakespeare is a somewhat surreal experience to begin with. I believe this is the best work ever by Baz Luhrmann, and this is the peak of his career (as of 2014), and his magnum opus.  The best use of a song ever may be ""Kissing You,"" by Des'ree at the Capulet ball. 100% captivating and beautiful. It is astonishingly beautiful, and I was surprised that someone captured the music that was in my head.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure that too much of the acting in this movie was really award worthy, at least coming from Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The standouts are in the minor roles played by John Leguizamo, Paul Sorvino, and Pete Postlethwaite. The directing was so overpowering, though, that this movie still manages to be a classic without particularly strong leads. Claire Danes's face and presence really seem to say something, but she really just doesn't have the talent. She is pretty and looks the part, but her part would have been better recast. Sorry to say. DiCaprio does ok here, but perhaps someone would have done better than him as well. As with a lot of actors in Shakespearean roles, I'm not sure he totally understands the emotionality and the dialogue. I take off one star and I'm not sure why, but I think the language may have made it hard to connect with the emotionality of the movie, and DiCaprio and Danes were a little bit wooden. It was slightly hard to connect with the emotional developments of the story. The big score here (and I mean big) is the stylistic side of this movie: the scenery, music, and frenetic, surreal, and campy tone. Amazing.

In any event, this movie still manages to be a sweeping and powerful tour de force for Luhrmann. It is a singular effort that keeps its gusto and inspiration alive from beginning to end. The creative drive for it was a stroke of genius for Luhrmann, and his trademark style works here the best for any of his movies, except perhaps for in ""Strictly Ballroom."" He had a notable swing and a miss with ""Moulin Rouge,"" and ""Gatsby"" simply didn't quite pop, in spite of not being as bad as ""Moulin Rouge."" The idea that someone made this movie out of nowhere in 1996 was a revaluation. This movie is brilliantly creative, and everyone should see it!",1417132800,,2531,4.683146067415731

The acting in parts was excellent, but my biggest gripe was with the gal who played Juliet. Just didn't make the connection. Seemed just a little too ""confident and spunky"" through the movie, which took away her depth. I just didn't see a range of conflicts like you saw with Romeo. Look, she's betraying her family and friends: you saw this with Romeo. Why doesn't she seem terrified at the results of her action? Just no range.

Add to that number two and three, the fact that I am and always have been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan (like most of us ladies lol). I like that they stuck to the play with the old English etc because if they hadn't I'm almost positive I wouldn't have even watched it. I have to mention one really creative thing about the movie. Obviously in the play the men have swords not guns so when there are fight scenes they always draw their swords. In the movie they used guns but etched on the side of their guns was the word ""sword"", like a brand name. Also putting the setting in what looks like Venice beach (or Verona beach) rather than the fictional Verona, which is clearly not in America was a neat twist. All in all a good movie, beautiful color and directing and it didn't completely butcher a timeless piece of literature.

The soundtrack is absolutely perfect!! I'm loving the benefits if Amazon Prime, bc I live In a nursing home at 36yrs. old, and it's hard for me to ask a CNA to come in my room and start looking for a particular DVD. My room is VERY WELL organized, but I love being able to find movies I love and just watch them FREE with my membership. However, I hope the doesn't go up again, bc my income is a ""set income"". After the ""rent"" I pay to my home, by law in Texas, every single perms ant resident, NO MATTER THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY, DISABILITY, ETC., we all get to keep INLY $60 each month. So, I really watch my dollars and cents, and Amazon Prime is a big, big help to me. Also, because of that, other people that want to send me like money or groceries, say a care package, etc., I've gotten them to subscribe to Amazon Prine, and they live it, bc they can look at my wish list(s) and order things I might need and have it sent right here to my door!!

861221,4,630438551X,"Baz Luhrman's sense of color, framing and imagery makes this quasi-hip-hop update of Shakespeare's doomed romance a visual cocktail worth staring at without even thinking. Engaging and enlivening from the intensity of the visions, it conjures things beyond the classic language and star-crossed love waged against a family feud.
Leonardo DiCaprio is at his waifish not-so-innocent best, and his manifests an ardor for Clare Danes that shows why he was the squeal-inducer of an entire generation. Danes' Juliet is a bit more oblique, but the tentative attraction on her part and ultimate surrender suggests a young woman torn -- and ultimately, given over to the power of her emotions.
With a street gang undertow, the update now seems a bit dated. But again, the over-the-top visuals transcend a time or place to become -- like ""Moulin Rouge"" -- its own place and time. As an escapist variation on a Shakespeare classic, this ""Romeo + Juliet"" is a wonderful, hyper-intense exploration.",1413072000,,985,5.1625

861274,1,630438551X,"Oh my where do I begin, this movie was the big to do when I was a kid. All the girls were beside themselves over it and you couldn't talk about anything else.

I have always been a big fan of Shakespeare and love seeing the different adaptations of his works. However there has always been one story that I just couldn't stomach, Romeo and Juliet. So many people laud this as a wonderful romantic tragedy but frankly its just horrible in every way.

Basically this is a ""love"" story about two teenagers who have a crush that leads to several people dying.
Romeo is clearly an emo play boy who is constantly flopping from one crush to the next. Juliet, who is actually very very young in the story, is clearly suffering under the totalitarian rule of her parents and doesn't want them to dictate her marriage to her. When she meets Romeo it's not instant love, it's the best of a bad situation. When Juliet threatens to kill herself it isn't because she can't be with Romeo, nope it's because she doesn't want to be forced to marry Paris.
This isn't a love story, it's just a bad sexual romance.
I can go on and on, probably writing a detailed analysis of the failings of this work that would be longer than the original play, but I frankly don't care.
The characters are flaccid and two dimensional, the so called ""romance"" is so contrived and awkward that it is a pain to witness, and the entire situation is forcibly contrived.
After years of seeing and reading this garbage I am forced to make one conclusion, that Shakespeare did not write this as a tragic romance, but as a parody of romance and romantic stories. Especially as a parody of teenage love.
The characters, events, dialogue, and outcome fit so much better if you think of them as parts of a comedy not a tragedy.
As it stands I would not recommend this story to anyone at all, especially if you have a truly romantic spirit, because it's simply torture to watch the stupidity play out.
As far as the film goes however there are some redeeming qualities. The cinematography is fairly good but does have an over the top feel that Hollywood has become accustomed to. And the acting is actually pretty decent, I still enjoy John Leguizamo the most as he does deliver a very powerful performance.
But if you want that there are several other movies that are far better to watch.

Simply put, this film and story are only for lonely women and girls who have no concept of what real love and devotion are. So pretty much the same ones who love Hunger Games and Twilight for the ""romance"" that is utterly atrocious.",1412812800,,2575,4.486140724946695

By the end of the movie, I wanted to lean forward, tap her on the shoulder and say, ""Yes. THAT was Shakespeare.""

Sometimes a movie or play that's boldly and dramatically directed is about the director's ego.. Baz Lurhmann's Romeo and Juliet, beautifully and boldly filmed, is about how great the play is. His version captures more than just the original spirit of the play. It makes it possible for modern day audiences to feel what the audiences of Shakespeare's day must have felt on seeing this play's first productions.

861422,5,630438551X,"Thinking back about my school years I remember reading Rome & Juliet numerous times throughout school. The one thing I never was able to experience was seeing it translated to the big screen. The first time I watched Romeo & Juliet - The Music Edition I knew Baz Luhrmann (director) struck cinema gold. Being able to take one of the most timeless classics of all time and transform it not only while maintaining its integrity, but transforming it into a movie the younger generations can relate to was impressive to say the least.

I think my opinions fall on a couple distinct lines as follows:

1) The rendition of the movie using as many original lines as possible even in a modern setting made the film better.
One of the biggest fighting points I've seen with regards to this film is the 50/50 spread on whether or not Luhrmann should have stuck as true to the original lines as he did. Personally I don't think there is any question that was the right call. When thinking about what Shakespeare is all about, you need that element of originality because the nature of the plays lends itself to these types of adaptations in which directors are able to transpose the Romeo & Juliet of the past in 1996.

2) Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were great choices.
I know some of the acting seems overplayed, some of the dialog may seem a bit cheesy, and some of the actor placed emotion may seem over the top, but I cannot see a different set for Romeo and Juliet than DiCaprio and Danes. I find it quite ironic knowing that Leonardo is the heart-breaker for many-a-girl as Romeo must have been for the young women in the play's setting--Juliet included. Personally I think Luhrmann hit then nail on the head with that combo and because of it the movie is still being shown in schools, talked about by contemporaries, and viewed on TV.

Overall take a chance and see if the stars align for you and this film. I know they did for me, and I'm fairly certain they can for you as well!

Claire and Leo had great chemistry, the direction? Exciting, Harold Perrinau as ""Mercutio"" was scene stealing.

There are always ways to update any Shakespearean play, but this doesn't miss the mark simply because it's ""updated,""  it misses the mark because it cannot capture anything relevant from the play.

I fell in love with a nonexistent Romeo with those songs and when I hear them again, he reappears in my mind, even though I am happily married, and I end up kissing him and floating in a pool and running off and then dying with him.",1395878400,,904,4.0

861593,5,630438551X,"I was highly skeptical of this film, and my expectations for it were very low. I was shocked to enjoy it as thoroughly as I did. There were a few things about it that I wasn't totally thrilled with, but not enough to bring it down to 4 stars--it was closer to 5 stars, so that's what I'm giving it.

Modernizing a Shakespeare play without ruining it is a challenge, to be sure. This film is very clever in the ways it finds to mingle the original dialogue with updated props and scenes. The tragic love story at its core came through beautifully.

What I like best about this version is that it's so accessible. This is a movie that young people can relate to, that will draw them into the storyline. I didn't particularly care for Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this film. He really shines, and so does Claire Danes. In fact, all the actors seem to handle their parts quite well. I was particularly impressed with the nurse, the priest, the chief of police (clever, making him a police chief named Prince), and Mercutio. Both patriarchs were great in their roles as well.

This is a movie that deserves a chance. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away. Give it 20 or 30 minutes and decide for yourself. It's not perfect, but there are aspects of it that are brilliantly clever. I never expected to like this movie, but I was astonished to discover that I liked it very much.",1395100800,,1381,4.429133858267717

It's kind of MTV meets High Noon on steroids, while the language remains true to Shakespeare's text most of the time. The best characters, besides Romeo and Juliet, where the nurse and friar. The Capulets and Montagues distinguished themselves from each other in color, race and outfits, making it really easy to see that there was no love lost between them. On the whole, this is a great movie, with it's modern (South) American beach town setting and the attention paid to small details to set the scene (beat up mobile home in the dessert, toys on Juliet's bookshelf) are amazing.

The pace was about right for her and now I am teaching her to quote from the movie.  ""What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?""  I see Queen Mab hath been with thee.""

This modern take on Shakespeare's tragic classic tale is pretty good, although a couple characters and scenes seem fairly over the top. Leo and Claire both do a very nice job as the star-crossed and doomed lovers, and the opening scene was very clever, but the music didn't fit every scene and many well known characters now modernized, perform their roles brilliantly.

The idea of transporting romeo and Juliet into modern day times without changing the Shakespearean language was excellent- unfortunately, some of the pathetic quality was lost in the process. I would recommend this movie as a pleasant (and romantic) time killer, but not if you're looking for a sensational eye opener.",1368316800,,422,5.042857142857143
862147,4,630438551X,This version is entertaining for the modern elements incorporated into a classic story. I still think the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli version is the best.,1368144000,,149,5.25
862148,2,630438551X,"The Leonardo DiCaprio version of Romeo and Juliet, at the end of the day, is a poor attempt of modernizing a Shakesperean classic. I'm not a big fan of romances. However, I do respect Romeo and Juiet as a classic story. There are other problems that I had with the film other than the romance. The cast is not the greatest.

The side cast do alright overall. However, DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet, do not sell it in my opinion. DiCaprio and Danes, in my opinion, do not sell that Shakesperean dialog. Their performances felt forced. The production values are great from a technical level. However, I'm not a fan of the modern setting.

The director, Baz Luhrmann, who also directed Moulin Rouge, has a tendency to take a classic tale and try to modernize it, which does not work in my opinion. It's not as bad as Moulin Rouge where the setting is the 1800s but the music is from the late 1900s, where here everything is modernized. However, I still feel something is off. This is probably because I'm comparing this to the 1968 film. I did like the film okay. I felt that film capured the setting and the feel of the tale much better than this film.

Overall if you want a faithful adaptation of the classic Shakesperean play, watch the 1968 movie. Give this a skip.",1367971200,,1283,4.4743589743589745
862199,4,630438551X,"Luhrmann somewhat met Shakespeare's intentions.  The dialogue in the movie and the play were similar, however Luhrmann did leave out some aspects of the play.  In the fight scene in which both Mercutio and Tybalt are killed, Tybalt was not accidentally killed like in the play--Luhrmann portrayed Tybalt's death as a result of Romeo's rage over Mercutio's death.

While it may have been more dramatic and romantic, the balcony scene in the movie occurred in the pool in the Capulet estate in the movie.  Having the balcony scene in the pool created more suspense, but didn't match with Shakespeare's intentions.  Having the scene occur on the balcony showed Romeo and Juliet's true love and the distance keeping them apart.

In the book, Juliet was discovered ""dead"" by the nurse then her family came to her room and expressed their sorrow.  Luhrmann, however, decided not to include Juliet's family discovering her ""dead"" in his film.  In doing this, the movie audience missed out on seeing Juliet's family as they were grieving over her death and expressing their love for Juliet, especially Lord Capulet as he had been very upset with Juliet earlier in the play when she expressed that she did not wish to marry Paris.

Luhrmann did accurately portray the main characters.  Many of the scenes were also accurately portrayed, like the fight between the Montagues and Capulets in the first scene of the play.  The brawl in the book and in the movie both started with the biting of a thumb.

Luhrmann's modern portrayal of Romeo and Juliet with Shakespearean dialogue made the movie comical.  Because Shakespeare focused on writing tragedies, he might not approve of this comical spin on the play.",1367884800,,1697,4.954063604240282
862200,4,630438551X,"I liked Romeo + Juliet because Baz Luhrmann chose to stay true to the original Shakespearean text while adding modern art and cinema concepts.  Montagues and Capulets were represented as warring empires in Verona Beach and swords were replaced with guns.  Shakespeare would have liked this version of one of his most famous works because it stayed relatively true to the events in the play.  The true emotions, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack in Romeo + Juliet made up for any scenes that may have seemed ""shaven down"" compared to the play.  This version also preserved the original meaning of the language used in Shakespeare's time that might have been lost had it been translated to modern speech.  Overall, I think Luhrmann did a good job of accurately reworking Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet while effectively catching the audience' attention.",1367798400,,857,5.181159420289855

The movie seems to be making a mockery of Shakespeare's writing. The scene also has some cheesy scenes but overall it was funny. The acting seemed to be raw and the plot remained undeveloped. The director's modern interpretation of the play will appeal to younger audiences because of it's added humor but will be dry and annoying to Shakespeare fans. The character of Romeo seems to be portrayed well and does actually make him seemed like a confused boy. The interpretation of Mercutio was terrible and annoying. The movie will suite younger audiences who find the plot of Romeo and Juliet to be dry and clear-cut because this will be something they will be interested in. However, the play seems to portray Friar Lawrence as a villainous character and seems to blame him for the cause of Romeo and Juliet's death. The original play allows the reader to decide who they believe is at fault. The movie also seemed odd by the use of old English rather than modern day English. The play was modernized so it only seemed natural that the duologue should be modern. In summary, the play will soothe well with some audiences and annoy other audiences.",1367798400,,1300,4.632034632034632

Luhrmann still hits the main theme that hatred can defeat love in the end shown by Romeo and Juliet's deaths. Overall Luhrmann's version think exceeds Shakespeare's initial intentions. I think Shakespeare would be amazed on how Luhrmann tied in his dialogue, which is really difficult to do. The movie also showed how Romeo wears his emotions on his sleeve. Romeo's instant action of killing Tybalt exceeded the original story's climax of the story. Luhrmann's use of camera angles and weather adds a finished touch and effect on the story.

The movie is a great movie but it's not something Shakespeare would approve of. I feel as if he would want a modern movie to take on the modern text. The play should be fit to the period, in this case it is a modern time and so it would only make sense for the dialogue to follow. I truly enjoyed the movie I just do not think it is something that Shakespeare would endorse.

862267,1,630438551X,"The director of this film, Baz Luhrmann, imagined how Shakespeare himself might have directed Romeo and Juliet as a movie, based on the idea that plays in Shakespeare's time competed against coarse entertainments such as bear baiting and prostitution.  The thought was provocative, but the result was a film that is, in my opinion, a mess.

The first problem, revealed fairly quickly, is that the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  The opening sequence in which the ""Montague Boys"" meet the ""Capulet Boys"" at the gas station might as well be a comic book.  It's shot very much like a music video, and takes the film in a definite slapstick, comic direction that is almost immediately reversed as the film progresses.  There's a good deal of humor in the play, but to go as far over the top as Luhrmann did was counterproductive.

The second, and ultimately greater, problem is the actors' inability to handle the language. There are fine actors in this cast who have done excellent work elsewhere, but in this film many of them seem to do the equivalent of speaking a foreign language phonetically without actually knowing what they are saying.  John Leguizamo, Leonardo di Caprio, Claire Danes, and Harold Perrineau all suffer from this, or at least are the cast members who are most conspicuous.  This is a problem for audience members who do understand the language, as the way the lines are spoken will drive such audience members crazy.  It creates a different problem for audience members not familiar with Shakespeare, as they won't understand what is being said any more than the cast members who are saying it.

The only two actors whose command of the language stands out are Pete Postlethwaite as ""Father"" Lawrence, and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse.  To indicate the difference in training between the U.S. and Britain, Ms. Margolyes is an English actress who absolutely convinces as a Hispanic maid.

All of these problems come to a head in the most important scene in the film, in which Mercutio is killed by Tybalt, who is in turn killed by Romeo.  Blow this scene, and you pretty much blow the whole play.  This movie really blew this scene, and that was that.

Good idea by Mr. Luhrmann, but it didn't work.  It really missed the mark.",1365897600,5,2265,4.754475703324808
862268,3,630438551X,"I like how the director incorporated modern influences in order to grab the attention of people who may not be so much into Shakespeare, however some of the delivery was all wrong. Maybe it's because I am an English Teacher and a literature nerd, but some aspects to this movie were just bad.
MAJOR parts of the play were simply cut, MAJOR parts were changed, and some parts were just confusing. I mean, why does Mercutio have to dress up in drag? What is the purpose of that whole scene? And how can Romeo not get a simple letter from the Friar if they have cars?!

On the other hand, there is just something about this movie. Parts of it were so watchable, you fell in love with certain characters again because of their passion, and you walked away thinking 'ok that was kind of a neat concept'. Maybe it had something to do with a young Leo Dicaprio....

Overall, it's just okay. I see what the director was trying to accomplish, but there were many different ways he could have done it. Yes, all movies made from books, plays, etc leave out aspects, but this one left out important details that completely changed the tone. Characters who did play larger parts in the play only played minor parts, and I really think some of the modern influences took away from overall quality of the movie.",1365811200,,1296,4.487288135593221

862424,4,630438551X,"I have always been torn between liking and disliking this movie. At times I think it's a great concept, but other times I can't overlook the imperfections and stereotypes created by Baz Luhrman. Any way one looks at it, the movie is certainly worth considering. If you're patient, what here I've missed, my explanation shall strive to mend

To begin with, the story of Romeo and Juliet is not the genesis of William Shakespeare, rather it is a story sprung from antiquity. The tale of star-crossed lovers potentially goes back as far as oral tradition, but one can put a name to the first consideration. Ovid's story of struggling lovers laid the framework for William Shakespeare to take over centuries later. As the story was told more often, more characters came to light - thus the play is a living being capable of taking on numerous changes. In fact, Romeo and Juliet did not stop after Shakespeare made it famous. Playwrights continued to use the basic storyline in many plays, including one about two quarreling senators instead of lovers. The most famous remake would be Westside Story.

Because of this play's constant evolution, I think the Luhrman version becomes acceptable viewing. He puts his own spin on it. He moderinizes it. He targets the very audience who is intrigued by tales of woe. Baz Luhrman makes the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet his for two hours. His approach puts a fresh face on a tragedy that is on DVD shelves with overacting players with heavy British accents. There's nothing wrong with that approach, it just doesn't pull in the average audience.

The aspects of the movie I don't agree with are two-fold. The first disagreeable part is nothing major. To have the play shortened by leaving out scenes, I feel, is disprespectful to the script. I understand that two hours' traffic on stage is difficult to sell investors on, but it's the most famous tragedy of all time. If Baz Luhrman has no interest in filming every scene, then perhaps he should've prepared to find a way to make that happen. I also was not a fan of the many misattributed quotes - script altering - throughout the movie. Not only does production leave out scenes, but they switch lines to other characters. Again I felt this to be an egregious disregard for the script.

The second aspect is on a broader scale. Leonardo Dicaprio plays a good Romeo. The problem is, he plays a good stereotypical Romeo. There are times in the movie where he seems to be an impulsive teenager as he should be. But it is Romeo's part within the script that is misunderstood. Many casual readers read the play assuming Romeo loves Juliet. In fact, Romeo is smitten with Rosaline and then does an about-face upon seeing Juliet. This is the first hint that Romeo really doesn't have feelings for Juliet. Even Friar Lawrence states in his cell that Romeo was babbling like a baby the day before over Rosaline and now today he's bubbling over Juliet.

Juliet's quote of ""You kiss by the book"" could prove Romeo's lack of skills. Juliet could be shooting him down by saying his kiss was so basic that it seemed he learned it from some book. Again, Romeo seems to fit the bill of a teen-aged boy running astray. Furthermore, when Romeo swears by the moon he strikes out while attempting to steal Juliet off of her feet. His apathetic style seems perfect for the impressionable Juliet who seems to be running wild with puppy love. Finally Romeo asking if Juliet would leave him ""so unsatisfied"" shows Romeo's narcissistic behavior toward Juliet who apologizes for being too easy to be sweet-talked.

Because of this, Romeo can be categorically labeled as misplayed on a regular basis. Perhaps eventually Romeo develops feelings for Juliet, and it could be the explanation behind him taking his own life. But since Dicaprio falls into the frustrating recurrence of Romeos who are struck with blind love from the get-go, it leaves me feeling bothered by a missed opportunity.

As stated before it is certainly a movie worth considering. Mercutio's part was the best acted in my opinion as it wove in a theory of potential love between Romeo and him. Regardless of the theory, Meructio's lines roll off naturally. Claire Danes delivers a fairly decent performance as Juliet, and John Leguizamo as Tybalt is equally natural. I can understand where those who dislike the movie are coming from, and I can also understand the cult status this movie endures. I still believe it is worth at least one viewing especially if it pulls more readers into the intoxicating world of William Shakespeare.",1355270400,,4565,4.792884371029225

862587,1,630438551X,"Titling this movie _William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet_ is either provoking or hilarious, depending on your point of view. Not since Sam Taylor's _The Taming of the Shrew_ in 1929 has an English-language Shakespeare movie used such a small percentage of Shakespeare's text. Rarely since then have Shakespeare's words been as ineptly spoken or, for that matter, as unconvincingly acted on screen as they are here. And as for plot:

In Shakespeare's tragedy, Juliet is a 13-year-old girl (and Lady Capulet still in her twenties). The most famous scene shows Romeo paying court to Juliet as she stands above him on her moonlit balcony, which serves as a potent visual symbol of their budding relationship; no matter how he longs to touch her, she is inaccessible, out of reach. The following night, her Nurse supplies a rope ladder so that Romeo can ascend to be with his bride. In the final scene, Romeo forces open the Capulets' tomb, kills Paris in combat there, then kills himself before Juliet awakens from her deathlike sleep. After talking with Romeo's page, Friar Laurence rushes in, hoping to prevent such a tragedy, but he loses his nerve and runs out, whereupon Juliet stabs herself. The warring families come to the cemetery--without Lady Montague, who has died of grief--and achieve a shamefaced reconciliation as they contemplate their losses.

These statements are not spoilers, however, because not one of them matches what happens in the movie. How then is it William Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_?

In an updated California treatment like this one, we can of course count on Baz Luhrmann for an unprecedented number of gimmicks per minute. In one light, he is working in the visually opulent, operatically overblown, and spectacularly, unapologetically tasteless style of earlier music-loving movie directors like Franco Zeffirelli and Ken Russell. In fact, many aspects of Luhrmann's film have inescapable parallels with Zeffirelli's equally overrated _Romeo and Juliet_, so popular with teen audiences in 1968 and '69. Among other examples, we encounter:

--a younger Nurse than typically found in traditional productions;
--a Juliet who lives in fear of an abusive father;
--a Capulet fest interrupted by an interpolated song about love;
--a scene-stealing, flamboyantly overemotional Mercutio, portrayed as an angry sort of misfit who clearly seems to be in love with Romeo;
--at least one character dunking his head in a fountain;
--one camera shot where a key actor is totally unable to cry convincingly on cue;
--the superfluous repetition of a phrase like ""All are punished"" (with that last word wrongly pronounced as three syllables);
--and, again, text that has been thoroughly mangled, first by drastic editing and then by photogenic young actors who truly do not seem to understand the lines they are mouthing.

Zeffirelli's leads are more successful at looking pretty while wearing a variety of earnest expressions, but Luhrmann's American actors definitely win the prize for sounding clueless and uncomprehending. Without rewriting as outrageously as his predecessor, Luhrmann does sanction a handful of brainless changes in Shakespeare's text (""a rose by any other WORD""?)

Those who feel inclined are welcome to trace the similarities between the Luhrmann movie and _West Side Story_, with its contemporary street gangs and Hispanic version of the Capulets. (If you want a _West Side Story_ rewrite, seek out the superior Spanish film _Los Tarantos_.)

Only one aspect of Luhrmann's vision is genuinely thought-provoking. What DiCaprio's Romeo appears to like best about Juliet is simply that she is so *available*, so eagerly receptive to his embraces. Adding to her attraction, no doubt, is the fact that when they first begin making out, Romeo is just coming down from the effects of a mind-altering drug, while Juliet is literally dressed like an angel. Friar Laurence seems quite right to worry that just as Romeo has lost interest in Rosaline, he will not remain faithful to Juliet for long. Whatever headstrong despair he registers at the thought of her death reflects, to this viewer, more of guilt than deathless love.

The most satisfying sequence for me, however, involves Romeo's attempt to make peace with Tybalt (the former briefly sounding sincere and mature), only to have Tybalt turn on him and beat him up. This is not what Shakespeare had in mind, but it fully justifies Mercutio's outrage at Romeo's refusal to defend himself.

Though my wife refuses to watch the movie, I know she would enjoy the car chase in the final act, where Romeo is seriously guilty of surpassing the speed limit. This, too, is not what Shakespeare had in mind, but it is well calibrated to reinvigorate those viewers who have been growing bored since the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt.

There is just one moment that really surprised me. According to the closing credits, Luhrmann actually paid a certain Lilene Mansell to serve as ""dialogue and speech coach."" Amid all the shouting and sniffling and mumbling and murmuring--where the assumption seems to be that the audience is not going to pay much attention to what the characters are saying anyway--we might at least have dreamt that this hip-hop generation would have some sensitivity to the underlying beat of Shakespeare's text. No such luck. For instance, DiCaprio and company don't even recognize that to fit the verse meter, the heroine's name must be two syllables (JOOL-yet) and not three (they persist in calling her ""joo-lee-YET"").

Anyhow, that's the least of this movie's problems. I could give it two stars, on the grounds that it's entertaining in a kitschy, implausible way (and sometimes tense without becoming nauseatingly violent), but I won't. When the final gunshot was followed by some of the closing phrases of _Tristan und Isolde_, I found myself thinking, ""Right! Similar story! I should have listened to Wagner's opera instead.""

To end with a SPOILER: This film does have one point in common with Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet both die. Over the centuries, there have been adaptations where they didn't. Some of those, in fact, were probably more faithful to Shakespeare than this.

UPDATE. I've belatedly listened to the audio commentary track, where Baz Luhrmann and three of his colleagues duplicate several of my own observations (including the idea that in their view, it doesn't really matter whether you can understand the lines the characters are saying). But let's allow Luhrmann to have the last word:

""Believe you me, I am not the first to butcher Shakespeare.""",1341100800,2,6585,5.165103189493434

862590,4,630438551X,"Well, as you may expect, I am watching this in school with the rest of the class. Romeo and Juliet was definitely a timeless story, but this modern-day adaptation took it to the most unbelievable heights! In this version of the classic, it's all set in pure modern-day, complete with television, beaches, cars, buildings, etc. And guess what? The characters still speak in Shakespearean English! This makes a really hilarious impact upon the film! They even call the guns ""swords"", since the guns are manufactured by a fictional company named Sword, so you can easily tell that the laughs you got from all this were intentional.

Not all is undramatic, though. After all, Romeo and Juliet IS a tragic play. The movie still captured that tragic image, as characters grew pretty emotional during scenes from Mercutio's death to beyond. In fact, I'm actually kinda annoyed by some scenes. You see, said scenes are way, WAY more emotional than they need to be. For example, when Juliet refuses to marry Paris even after Romeo's banished, she and Capulet push each other around during an overly heated argument (Juliet cries this whole time while trying to talk back). I really would've just preferred an angry argument. And after that, when Juliet goes to Friar Lawrence, there's another conversation, but she was STILL sobbing, and even held a gun to her head for a brief moment! This is just too much...

But aside from scenes like those, this is a very fresh take on Romeo and Juliet. It's really funny to see the characters re-imagined in this modern-day world. I bet that after footage was taken, the actors were laughing for quite some time, considering what they had just spoken to each other (The acting itself is actually very top-notch, if not a little overboard, like what I described above).",1336694400,,1799,4.856677524429967

Five minutes into this Romeo and Juliet, I got the feeling that unless the camera work and the soundtrack changed in a major way, I might not be able to continue watching.  I stuck with it, however, and was impressed on a couple levels:  first how the original story translates so easily to modern sensibilities, and secondly how DiCaprio and Danes were able to speak to an audience of cynical 9th graders.
An explanation is in order.  Teaching Romeo and Juliet to high school freshmen can be daunting, but by juxtposing this version with other treatments for certain parts of the play (the initial fight, the ball, the balcony scene...) students were able to catch the feel of how the story can be told in numerous ways.
The end result was that the students preferred the DiCaprio version (as it came to be known) and even though the language was faithful to the original they stuck with it.  Using the closed captioning helped here.
The end result is that this is an enjoyable treatment and since the story is so well known, it's fun dealing with the sometimes jarring physical treatment.",1335916800,,1460,4.657587548638133

Unfortunately, though she loves the principal actors in this, we both thought that this version - an update that uses the original language in a weird LA-like city, with organized crime gangs replacing the rival families - was over the top.  It is also absurdist comedy, gender-bending, and full of incomprehensible visual flourishes, none of which adds to the story.  Of course, this is personal, even visceral, as you either get or you don't.  We didn't quite.  For example, when the couple meets on the balcony, they wind up falling into a TV-monitored swimming pool, dodging security guards while floundering in deep water.

Nonetheless, at its best, there are moments that the emotional spirit comes through well.  As truly fine actors, Danes and DiCaprio have good on-screen chemistry.  I may not think that Mercutio was a super-effeminate whatever, but his bipolar energy comes through.  Tybalt's macho, in-the-moment spirit also succeeds, even if he duels with fancy guns.

862945,5,630438551X,"Despite what any purist or scholar may tell you Shakespeare's plays are blueprints for live stage performances. Reading a play is akin to reading a screenplay and if you have ever read either you will know they are the worst way to experience what is essentially an unfinished work of art. Films are the modern equivalent of classic stage plays and I'm sure Shakespeare himself would appreciate the power of film and what is possible with storytelling when using it as the medium.

As someone who always struggled to stay interested in classics, despite the beautiful language used, I find a modern telling of a classic much more accessible than simple raw readings of his works which were meant to be seen as plays, not as words on a page. Reading a screenplay to a great film has it's place but usually if one has already seen the film. To me, the same holds true here. And I have already read this play and seen dry interpretations of it and was not moved until seeing this film. The words, give or take, are there fresh from the page but they come to life here.

I don't subscribe to the point of view that the only interpretation is that of a classic interpretation. As time goes on the old language can get lost on the page, which does not have the luxury of a novels description. Once set alive and moving with flesh and blood actors the story leaps as it was meant to. Some may hate the setting and modern flashy style but I think it brings home a great classic and can only serve as a portal for many who would have otherwise cared less and might just be sparked to go see a play or rent another Shakespeare DVD, or even puck up some of his writing and read some and actually enjoy it. Because once having seen it interpreted, in any way, good or bad, other than just words on a page, one might care just that much more.

Not every adaptation need get the finest actors and directors. Common folk too can pick it up to read and average actors can act it out too. I feel it was far above just average and I was pleasantly surprised at how moving and powerful it was. I think I enjoyed it most because I did not come at it expecting the same dry old stuffy stuff I've seen again and again.

Shakespeare's work certainly does not need to rely on a film like this to stay popular, but it helps. Before ever putting a written play before a youngster I might show this first to wake up the possibility of what the words can do when given to an artist. After all, no film class would spend an entire semester just reading screenplays of classic films. While a play might be ideal, cinema is our master art of our time and this film is the perfect portal to that old master of language and poetic work.",1292457600,6,2703,4.304518664047151

I have a doctorate in English and my husband has two master's degrees. So when our high school daughter wanted to go to home school, we agreed. For the most part things went smoothly except for mathematics, which none of us understand. But when we got to Romeo and Juliet and I showed the usual Olivia Hussey version, our daughter could not comprehend it. In total bafflement, she kept asking, ""But they're nice, rich, upper-class people. Why didn't they just let their kids marry each other?""

One day our drama major grown daughter showed up at our house and announced that she was taking our youngest daughter to a movie. They got home three hours later and our dramatic daughter said, ""Now come on, YOU'RE going to see this movie.""

She took us to the gangsta version of Romeo and Juliet, and we were both extremely impressed. When we got home, we discussed the play with our teenager, and now she understood it perfectly. There are numerous gangs in our neighborhood, and not too long before two friends of hers had killed each other a block from our church while our meetings were in progress.

Get this, anybody who disapproves: There were gangs in Shakespeare's day. There were gangs in King Solomon's day; the Book of Proverbs specifically mentions gang signs made with the hands. There is nothing new about gangs. And the Montagues and Capulets were gangsters, even if they were rich, upper-class gangsters.

Our daughter, to our amusement, kept dragging her friends to see the movie, until we managed to get a copy of it at home, and then she brought her friends to watch it at home.

I do not claim that she became an instant drama addict. She did not. She'd rather watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She never did understand why we often bought several different film editions of some plays. She could see that they were different, but she didn't and apparently couldn't get the concept of dramaturgy. She never could understand why we didn't know that Ophelia was pregnant until Mel Gibson told us. I went back and reread the play, and by golly, he was right. She was pregnant, and it's perfectly clear in the text. But she couldn't see that, either.

But my point is that if Shakespeare were alive today, and knew what was going on in the  United States, he'd guffaw at the Olivia Hussey version, and he'd be delighted with the gangsta version, because it says what he wanted to say.

This is well dramaturged (if that's a word), well cast, well directed, well acted, and has wonderful special effects, such as the name of the automatic pistols the gangsters were using. (No, I'm not going to tell you. Go see for yourself.)

I recommend this play to anybody who wants to teach it to his or her own child. I would fast-forward through the transvestite stripper scene, which was totally extraneous to the plot and slowed the movie down, but with that one exception, I would show it. Of course I'd have to give parents the right to opt their children out, if I wanted to show it at high school, but remember that today Romeo and Juliet both would be in high school.

I'd give this nine points if the scale went up to ten. I'd cut one point for that stripper scene. But I don't feel it's worth cutting one whole star for one unnecessary and obnoxious scene.",1288310400,2,3334,4.691780821917808

Even though there are a few flaws attached to these movies, I still found them enjoyable, except for one. Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet is one that I can't really adore. The entire film is bloated with an overly stylish look and a modernization that looks to have gone too far. First off, I will say that hearing Shakespearean dialogue in a completely modern setting is very awkward. It really confuses the tone of the film: it's like hearing the dialogue from the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a contemporary sports drama. Old and new doesn't work well here. The lack of accents are even worse. Most of these actors sound odd when reciting the text, mainly because they don't have the perfect voices for it. I may be a bit picky, but hearing Shakespeare from modern characters sounds strange. The script could have at least had some contemporary phrases added in. The biggest problem I have with this movie, however, is the excessive style. The Capulet scene especially is overstuffed with colorful costumes and sets, and some dizzying camerawork. The melodrama in the quieter scenes are so overdone that they're actually silly. The heartbreaking ending is slightly over-the-top, but at least it's done quite well. Nonetheless, a majority of this film is a spectacle of style-over-substance, and I don't think Shakespeare would be pleased with it if ever he were alive to see it.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of Luhrmann. I've seen his other film, Moulin Rouge!, and I dislike it for some of the same reasons I dislike Romeo + Juliet. I do like the music and the supporting cast, but I don't care about everything else in the movie.

Of all of them, this is the only one that actually keeps the plays dialouge, What it manages to do is keep up a constant pace that doesn't slow down from the heavy diologue, because as much as I love the plays, and have seen many of them live, the first order of a film is to show, and how it manages to do that is to constantly have visual reminders of what the characters are talking about.  All the actors are strong, and though for a long time surrounding Titanic I hated Leo, I have to say that he is a very talanted actor and this shows it.  Yes the two main characters are not good for anyone around them, there is a very serious tone that these two keep messing things up, but the supporting cast does a great job of picking up the slack to show the ramifications.  This movie doesn't appear as though it cost a lot of money, but definately has a lot of style, one of the best soundtracks of all time, my favorite song being a cover with full gospel choir of Prince's When Dove's Fly.

863209,5,630438551X,"When you are growing up, all you hear about is Romeo and Juliet. You've watched spoofs in your favorite cartoons, heard people quote it,and you get a picture of this epic romance that sweeps you off your feet. When you get to read it in high school, ""Man, now I get to see what all the hype is about."" Then you open the book and you see these lines:
""Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.""
""No for then we should be Colliers.""
  And if you were like me you said ""What the hell are they talking about? This isn't as good as all the hype it gets!"" But when you watch this movie it turns that story into the epic romance that everyone says it is, and probably what you thought it was before you read it. That, and the new setting and actors takes some of the cheesiness away from those cliched lines. Let's face it, "" ... and Juliet is the sun."" has way more impact when Leo DiCaprio says it, than when you read it. Also the lines are the same, but easier to interpret when in a modern setting.
  I'm not saying that the Zeffirelli version is bad or anything, but it can get slow at some points, and because of the medieval setting it doesn't make the lines much easier. That, and an interesting costume design for the guys in that movie seems to involve cups that they wear on the outside of their pants. It makes it kinda hard to take seriously. But it is still a great movie! Don't get me wrong!
  That and It has a stuck-in-your-head soundtrack that adds a whole new level to the movie. It also has a cool, artsy vibe to it that can seem overdone to some, or original to others. I didn't even like this story for a while, but now I want to read Romeo and Juliet again, with a better understanding of the lines.
  I just wanted to mention some of my favorite moments and ones to look out for. The actor who plays Mercutio (even in all his ridiculous cross-dressing scenes) still gives me chills during his eerie Queen Mab where he almost seems psychotic, but it captures your attention. Another moment is when Romeo confronts Tybalt after he kills Mercutio. ""Either you, or I, or both of us!"" is repeated, and shows this great moment of acting where he changes from distraught to furious. The last is the flashback scene when the commit suicide. In a moment that I usually don't find touching, the flashback to the moment they met, and another couple of cute scenes. It was really cute and sad.

863316,4,630438551X,"I was a gawky twelve-year old when this movie was released in 1996. I was negotiating for the first time the treacherous battlefield of middle school hallways: the gossip, the insecurity, and the foreign sensations, the blushing flush of first infatuations. It was a perfect time for me to see this movie. I remember the breathless trailers. Rat-a-tat shots of gang gunplay, adolescent romance, bright colors, and explosions, all backed by a pounding, bass-heavy soundtrack. Suddenly the old Bard of Avon seemed cool.

The theater was packed when I went. I recognized some kids from my school. The median age was probably 16. The lights dimmed. The screen flickered. The movie started. And off we went. Here was a world we recognized, a garish world of guns, trendy fashions, and solipsistic teenagers scribbling poetry in their notebooks. The audience snickered with recognition at Romeo's poolside pleading to Juliet, ""Wilst thou leave me so unsatisfied?"" And Juliet's retort, ""What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"" Gunplay and drug use and raging hormones. Well meaning adults and over-possessive parents. It was so familiar, but heightened, transfused into grand opera.

I'm no longer the wide-eyed innocent thrilling to Radiohead b-sides and drooling over Claire Danes (okay, not quite true). So how does the movie hold up? I'll be honest: I can't quite dissociate myself from the movie's nostalgic associations. But I'll try and be objective.

What holds up surprisingly well are the performances. The supporting cast is filled out nicely with well-cast veterans and some fresh-faced newcomers. I love John Leguizamo's cocksure Tybalt, all pointy teeth and resin-lined voice. Harold Perrineau (now I can't help but see Michael from LOST!) is a surprisingly affecting as the cross-dressing, drug-dealing misfit, Mercutio. He feeds Romeo a suspicious looking pill (ecstasy? acid?) before the Capulet party, and the results are appropriately trippy.

Pete Posthlewaite as Friar Laurence possesses the kind of natural ease with the dialogue that suggests many years of hard-won training on the boards. He wraps his lips around Shakespeare's Gordian knotted language as easily as if he were reading a grocery list--and with a put-on American accent!

Since this film DiCaprio has proven himself a worldwide mega-star, headlining such moneymaking behemoths as Titanic and The Departed. Here he captures the passion, the poetry, and the primal rage that imprison Romeo at any given moment. He's a slave to his emotions. He spends his time scrawling poetry in little black books and looking fashionably disaffected. He drops Rosalind in an instant after a one-time encounter with Juliet. He kills Juliet's kin, Tybalt, to revenge his friend's death, his face twisted into a terrible mask of rage. Later, after exile, he dies by his own hand thinking Juliet dead.

Ah, Juliet. Claire Danes. Okay, here's where the objectivity becomes difficult. She seemed like the epitome of mysterious older girl sensuality to me when I first saw this movie and now I'm writing from the perspective of someone a few years her senior when she made this movie. Hindsight shows that she doesn't have quite the same grasp and fluidity with the words DiCaprio possesses. What she does have is a winning smile and angelic features and an almost painful sincerity that broke so many hearts on the popular MTV program, ""My So-Called Life.""

I believe the Bard himself would like this movie. It has the spirit of the play--the tempestuous first love, the overbearing parents, the head-on collision with fate. It's aggressive and passionate and full of tumbling forward-moving energy. ""Vitality"" is the word Harold Bloom uses to summarize Shakespeare's enduring popularity and I think the adjective applies here. Luhrmann understands that the generation-spanning attraction to Shakespeare isn't always his words, strictly speaking, but rather the intensity and the passion that the words emote. We all know what it's like to be young and in love. Shakespeare gives words to those feelings. And they happen to be better written words than any others in the history of the English language. So what's lost here is the purity of the poetry, but what's gained is a new generations of kids saying, ""Maybe Shakespeare isn't so bad, after all."" They'll discover the poetry in time.",1235952000,5,4352,5.235294117647059

It seems that the defining cultural influences in his life were Sergio Leone Westerns, Hong Kong martial arts films, and Looney Toons cartoons.  The latter influence is particularly evident; it influences his editing and even his sound effects (look at his Moulin Rouge if you doubt it). Like many of the Bard's other plays, Romeo and Juliet has successfully survived many anachronistic adaptations to contemporary settings, but it can't overcome this. I've seen Lurid Luhrman's ""Romeo + Juliet"" shown to impressionable high school students many times (their teachers thought that teens wouldn't appreciate the story without a modern Verona Beach setting).  What they fail to understand (or understand all too well) is that Shakespeare's beautiful Elizabethan English is what hinders the student's comprehension.  It requires hard work from teacher and student alike in decipherment and contextualization. Doing less is simply a lazy cheat; placing the story in a lurid cartoon of contemporary America doesn't rectify that problem - particularly when actors rush through their lines, racing with the mad editor.",1212192000,,1280,5.51530612244898

Don't get me wrong; the actors make a valiant effort.  In fact, the actors' shared abilities are the saving grace for this film.  Even the love-at-first-sight connetion between Romeo (Dicaprio) and Juliet (Daines) is obvious.

Aside from the actors, however, this movie simply irritated me.  I appreciate the beauty and style of previous pieces too much to truly like this this version.  The previous movie adaptations stuck to the medieval nature, the sword-fighting days of old, and the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.  This travesty, on the other hand, made no such effort.

Guns, fireworks, pool-halls, neon signs, a red-headed guy with a box haircut, and a cross-dressing Mercutio?  It's just too forced and out of place; the anachronistic nature is just an impossibly big pill to swallow.  The combination of style and time-period for this historic piece feels like the Geico cavemen commercials; except, those commericals are intended to be funny.

Seeing modern day actors in contemporary settings and clothing while holding true to the original prose of Romeo and Juliet may have a cinematographic appeal to it, and I'm sure it introduced the arts to a generation with just enough attention span for a music video saturated with strobe-lights and special effects, but to me this movie is the proverbial elevator in an outhouse.",1208476800,,1519,5.056224899598393

With a tale this classic, this important to modern cinema it becomes something a bit wary to tackle it at its core and `remake' it from scratch.  One may be a tad hesitant to embrace its new shape and form and rightfully so.  When you look at the track record for remakes it becomes apparent that in general what was once golden should be left well enough alone.

The first thing that Luhrmann did right was stick to the original text.  A lot of people initially balked at the fact that the dialog was not updated along with the setting but I felt that artistically it was a much grander feat to have the original dialog kept intact.  The fact that each and every actor slips into this way of speaking fluently and without issue is an ode to some great talent indeed.  No one seems out of place of phoning it.  Each and every actor handles the difficult wording marvelously.  The next thing Luhrmann did right was trashing his setting.  What I mean by this is that he didn't go the easy route and make this posh and beautiful but rather he played everything down, creating an almost gritty and dirty feeling to the surroundings.  This is the future and the future is bleak.

The best thing that Luhrmann did though was casting Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles.  At the time DiCaprio was slowly becoming a credible actor and Danes was just becoming known.  Neither of them were quote-unquote household names or completely bankable yet but they both had proven they could act.  Here though we get to see how well.  To this day I still firmly believe that this is Leonardo's finest performance.  Both he and Danes masterfully command their characters.  Never has Romeo or Juliet felt so alive, so real and so relatable.  Their tragic love affair is so enthralling, so captivating and so breathtaking.  There are moments between them of pure beauty and strength that I'm appalled their performances didn't garner more awards attention.

The rest of the cast is equally as impressive, especially the likes of Harold Perrineau (of `Lost' fame) who plays Romeo's best friend Mercutio.  His performance is outlandish and flamboyant and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the film.  John Leguizamo is memorable as Tybolt, Juliet's cousin, and Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful as Father Laurence.  Paul Sorvino stands out for me as Juliet's father Fulgencio Capulet.  His performance is brutal and intense and sends chills down my spine in scenes.

`William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet' has never looked as good as it does here, telling the story of forbidden love and tragic circumstance that brings two families to their knees and teaches us a valuable lesson about forgiveness and tolerance.

Director Baz Luhrman has used every fast-cut camera angle, bright color, zoom, pan, fast-action trick in the book to keep this story moving along at a rapid, psychedelic clip.  It really is worth seeing, just for the director's vision, in the same way that Julie Taymor's interpretation of ""Titus Andronicus"" is worth seeing (if you can stomach it).

Hard-core Shakespeareans may cringe at some of the textual editing - e.g. Romeo saying, ""thy drugs are swift"" not as he dies at the end, but as he pops a tab of acid before going to the Capulet's costume ball.  That kind of stuff is unnerving, but you have to deal with text editing in any version of this play.

I had a hard time getting behind Leonardo diCaprio and Clare Danes as the lovers in this one.  Maybe it was their totally American accents.  Totally.  Or maybe it was the fact that they just came off as a couple of spoiled, bored kids looking for a thrill.  But then again, maybe that's what R&J are.  Spoiled, bored kids looking for a thrill. Or maybe it's because I'm getting older, I dunno.

Both Romeo and Juliet are in over their heads in this movie. Shakespeare's language can still be spoken in a way that is understandable when its natural rythmns and accents are correctly utilized. DiCappril especially seems to have no idea half the time what the words actually mean that he is speaking. And Claire Danes as ""Juliet"" is even worse.

The selective editing of the dialogue murders some of the more famous passages of Shakespeare, such as the morning scene debate about whether the lark has sung. The death scene lacks the dialogue and therefore the punch of the original. How anyone could shed a tear over the deaths of this ""Romeo and Juliet"" is beyond me. And the schlock of the TV announcer announcing the end of the play is poorly done. It could work as an excellent device for the close of the play, but this rendition spoken with no greater degree of involvement than that of a TV reporter, leaves one cold. So much for these ""star-crossed lovers."" You leave this movie wondering if they really were lovers after all or just two uninteresting actors trying to act as if they were in love.

In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and when hearing people say ""Shakespeare wrote for the common people"", I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.

This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialogue of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.

I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.

Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.

What keeps this movie from being a great one in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.

Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggling, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.

Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says ""By and by I come"", the maid's line is literally a grating, irritating scream: JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!  for at the very least, 3-5 seconds long

There's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back ""By and by I come""

All in all, the show is all but stolen by John Leguizamo and Harold Perrineau as Tybalt and Mercutio (respectively), while the lead actors are weak in their roles.

863652,5,630438551X,"Let me begin my review by addressing those who are undecided whether to purchase this version (Luhrman) or the Zeffirelli.  There seems to be a bias amongst educators (bordering on the arrogant) that the Luhrman version is somehow less ""authentic"" than the Zeffirelli.  Simply performing ""Romeo and Juliet"" in doublet and hose, however, does not make it any more ""Shakespearean"".  In fact, I would argue that modern-dress is more in keeping with the spirit of the original as Elizabethan drama had no elaborate sets or costumes; doublet and hose WERE modern-dress in Shakespeare's time.  If we discount ""updating"" as a reason to discount the Luhrman version (which in my experience is invariably the excuse), we have to judge the movies on how well they illuminate/connect/inspire Shakespeare's words for our students.  In my opinion, the Luhrman version does a better job of this than the Zefferilli.

First, the updating works (for the most part).  My students clearly understood gangs and rivalries; presenting the Montagues and Capulets as such, eliminated questions as why the two families hate each other or how the feud got started (answers which are outside the text).  The guns and cars appealed to the boys; the love and romance appealed to the girls.  My students could see themselves in the context Luhrman provided; they could relate to what was going on screen as present and relative, not merely events from 400 years ago.

Secondly, casting famous actors (DiCaprio and Danes) as the leads hooks many of my students at the beginning.  They watch the movie BECAUSE Leonardo DiCaprio is in it, but soon the magic of the Bard's words (which they struggle to follow at first) keeps them interested.  DiCaprio IMO is uneven; some scenes he performs better than others.  Danes's performance (other than her fake crying in the Capulet vault) was generally strong and very believable; her words did not seem ""acted"" but rather natural.  The supporting cast was also very good with Tybalt and Benvolio standing out.

There were some scenes that didn't work well for me.  The Capulet ball in particular was strange.  Mercutio came dressed in drag and this (unfounded) homosexual subtext was amplified by him prancing around on the stairs with some Chippendale dancers.  Just plain strange.  Also, the Queen Mab speech was weird and luckily cut short; Luhrman did try to tie it into the events as a sort-of intoxicated rambling at the ""pre-party"" (complete with Ecstasy) before Romeo crashes the ball.  Another weak performance was Lady Capulet who played it for laughs (which again I couldn't see from the text), and it was an unconvincing performance played that way.  The only time Lady Capulet seemed believable was when she played it serious (Tybalt's death, the argument with Juliet and Capulet).  Some students also didn't care for all of the musical numbers, but most liked how Luhrman tried to include contemporary songs into the movie.

Some of the sequencing of scenes are a bit off, but this is a movie students definitely love and get into... which I think is how Shakespeare would want it.",1179792000,17,3107,5.01364522417154

863747,3,630438551X,"While the 1996 remake of ""Romeo & Juliet"" was a bold attempt to update Shakespeare, the original play is far superior in many ways.  The filmmakers had the right idea, yet they attempted to re-create something that didn't need to be fixed.  However, the filmmakers are not to blame for there is really no way that it could've gone well.  It is a classic play that needs to take place in a classical setting for it to retain validity.

 The refashioning of the story took away from its emotional value.  Case and point, the use of modern-day weapons changes the focus of the scene from the characters' actions onto the weapons themselves.  Moments that contained beautiful simplicity were ruined by the over-produced attempt to modernize the story.  Again, these changes distract the viewer from the story, and force attention on the aesthetics.  In another example, the emotional heft of the final death scene was diminished by the bright, flashy graves.  Ironically, moments that could have used modernization from the original text were cut entirely out of the film.  For example, the Queen Mab monologue was significantly cut to keep the interest of the audience.

 Despite their bold attempt, the makers of the '96 Romeo & Juliet made a sub-par film.  I do not blame them at all; this film shouldn't have been made in the first place.  In order to capture the spirit of this story set in the early 1600's, it would need to have been set in that time period.  Sadly, we will never get positive or negative feedback from its author.

863753,5,630438551X,"Baz Luhrmann has been praised for making the highbrow accessable and criticized for dumbing it down. I think more than any other director of operas and, musicals and Shakespeare adaptations Luhrmann marches to the best of his own drummer.

With this adaptation of the Bard's most famous love story, Luhrmann introduced these immortal lovers to a new generation, setting the story in the modern world, having the actors use their American accents but speaking Shakespeare's words (with a few cuts here and there).

Part of the films sucess is due to it's casting. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes shine as the doomed lovers, playing their roles with all the vigour and enthusiasm of youth. Moreover they make us care about them because their characters are people- not archetypes. DiCaprio's Romeo is a normal teen in most respects. However his romantic nature sets him on a different wavelength from his peers, as does his impatience with the feuding between the Montagues and the Capulets. In an early scene we see him joking with his cousin Benvolio and then getting irratated when he learns that there has been a brawl. DiCaprio also, wisely contrasts Romeo's inital unrequited infatuation with Rosaline to his love for Juliet. Rosaline is a schoolboy's crush. Romeo  seems to enjoy posing as the tormented lover and therefore picks an unwilling object for his affections almost on purpose. When he meets Juliet there is no posing. His face is an open book and we immediately know that this in no passing infatuation- he's had that before. This is the real deal. As Juliet, Claire Danes brings a unique beauty and intelligence to what is too often played as a ""pretty girl"" role. Her Juliet is very aware of herself as a budding woman and is cautious approaching her feelings for Romeo. She wants to control her own life and live it on her terms and would sooner die then allow her parents to dictate who she would marry. Her screams and tears when she learns of her father's plan to marry her off are heart wrenching. The camera focuses on her face at the end of the scene and the devistation there is plain to see.

Both make the death scene (something we know is coming unless we've been living under rocks) seem like a trainwreck that you know is going to happen but you can't stop. I found myself hoping that DiCaprio would make Romeo's final monologue last a few mintutes longer giving Juliet time to wake up. I almost got my wish. Juliet awakes just as Romeo swallows the poison but too late to stop him. We see the realization that she is alive on Romeo's face and he utters his final line ""thus with a kiss I die"" looking at Juliet's crying face and speaking with all his desire to live. We see Juliet's reaction to watching her beloved die and hear her single desolate cry echo through her tomb once she realizes that he's gone and she's alone. I felt her desolation in that scene and I almost didn't blame her for her suicide. As the camera focuses on the bodies of the young lovers we see brief flashes of their interaction earlier in the film- laughing together at their meeting before each learns of the other's identity, at their wedding, smiling and joking with one another the morning after their wedding night. Each image is separated by the image of the same to vivacious youths, so deeply in love and for a few brief moments happy, lying side by side dead by their own hands. After a final shot of the dead lovers we see another, earlier image of them frozen in an eternal kiss. Yes, there is a ""sorrowful peace"" that takes place the following day between the two families, but as a viewer the true catharsis comes in those few brief moments that Romeo and Juliet had together.

The supporting cast is also strong for the most part. Harold Perrenau shines as Mercutio (a role that take the idea that the character might be gay to new heights by turning him into a flamboyant drag queen) His ""Queen Mahb"" speech is priceless, and any line that can possibly be interperted as a sexual innuendo is taken to extremes. Diane Venora turns Lady Capulet into a wanna-be Scarlet O'Hara and Pete Poselthwaite's Friar Lawrence is an occasionaly hard drinking confidant. More than any other character he is in a similar position to the viewer- caring about Romeo and Juliet, wanting happiness for them, foreseeing their doom and powerless to stop it.  The only weak spot is John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who potrays that his character is mean largly by scowling and spitting.

Luhrmann's quick camera work and fast paced style give an almost MTV feel to the film. This is appropriate as the music video is such an popular modern form of entertainment. A lot of adaptations forget that that's what Shakespeare wrote: entertainment for the masses. Avoiding the trap of many of it's predecessors this film doesn't allow itself to fall into the trap of pretentiousness, but rather seemlessly blends kitsch and low comedy with high tragedy.",1160092800,2,4944,4.708670520231214

For 9th grade students, Romeo & Juliet was the most anticipated/dreaded time of the year - with the girls anticipating and the guys dreading.  In teaching the play, I used both this movie version and the 1966 Zefferelli version.  As a former teacher, allow me to share some tips.

There are lots of good things about this movie.  While the two title roles are only good in execution, some roles are truly great, Tybalt and Harold Perrineau's Mercutio among them.  It is a worthy film in its own right, but it is also an EXCELLENT teaching tool.

Now to the teaching tips:

(1) Don't show this movie all at one time.  Students will miss 90% of what they need to see.

(2) Show the movie simultaneously with Zefferelli's film.  Both movies have much to offer and some weaknesses.  Invite students to compare and contrast the two, acting as experts.

(3) Show both movies a few scenes at a time, as you read the play.  Invite them to analyze what each director/screenwriter included/left out.  As them why the director/screenwriter made those choices.

(4)  Remember at all times that Shakespeare was not writing a ""work of literature""; he was writing a play, intended for performance.  No student will fully understand any of Shakespeare's plays unless they SEE them, preferably in as many forms as possible.

Practical Example:  Read the prologue and explain the function of the ""chorus"".  Have students translate the lines and explain what they mean.  View Zeferelli's prologue (under a minute)and discuss.  Then view Luhrmann' version (about 1.5 minutes).  Ask them what might have inspired him to do a prologue with a newsreporter as the chorus.  Have them pick out the symbols, foreshadowing, etc.  And finally let them vote about which one they like best and why.

Repeat the process with each section of the play.  It will take a little longer than showing the film at once, but you will be surprised how much 9th grade students will be able to understand (on their own) by the end of the play.",1153785600,23,2048,4.7578347578347575

863855,4,630438551X,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is certainly more applicable to a younger audience, but that is not to say older ones won't appreciate this version as well. For one thing, there are many visuals that do transcend into the modern era of time, one of which is simply the raucous manner of the two families towards each other, which we see in the opening scene. The Shakespearean sword is changed into a gun, the cars are used as a means of getaway, and Prince Escalus has a helicopter to track the recent brawl between the two families. Another aspect that keeps its roots is the tale of two young, immature lovers who stop at nothing to see each other despite their family's feud. I felt like both Leonardo DeCaprio and Claire Danes did decent jobs as Romeo and Juliet, but at times, they get a bit overdramatic. But, alas, it is Shakespeare, so I suppose we can forgive them for this.

Since almost everyone knows this story through and through and are especially familiar with its two main stars, I would like to focus on some of the other minor characters within the film. I felt like Mercutio's character came off as being a little too over-the-top; one of such instances is him dancing while dressed in drag on top of a car before the Capulet ball. Still, the ""Queen Mab"" scene was quite effective, and I thought that they did a good job of underlying the importance of Mercutio's feelings of Romeo's dreams. On the other side,  Tybalt's character, played by comedic actor John Leguizamo, did a superb job pulling off this character's motives and lines. You could almost suspend belief into realizing that this is guy was actually a goofy guy in The Pest, and the fact that he makes you forget this seems to indicate that he was ""into"" this character. Benvolio's character also was well performed, as he seemed to fit the role as confidant and peacemaker to a tee.

Overall, this version is a bit like Romeo and Juliet on steroids in the 90s. However, the fascinating aspect of reading and viewing Shakespeare-based plays is that there is a rich diversity of where and when you can place the setting--it is not limited to just what the Bard intended. For instance, it is not impossible to transcend Romeo and Juliet to many other places, such as a Western version of the play, or a play that is set in Victorian England. In this way, I think it is refreshing to see this version in a modern-Verona beach type setting in the mid 90s because not only does it appeal to today's audience, but I believe Shakespeare would love the idea of attempting something new and creative. The conflicts, the love, the themes still all have a way of translating well to this modern setting.

As many mention, this is a version that most either love or hate because of its modern attributes or its failing to compare to the older version. There are certain reasons why this film creates such a strong reaction, but I think this is an effort that should be commended on certain merits, simply because of the effort to make it different than most Shakespearean films or remakes of films.

It's a hunch, but I think Shakespeare would have loved the effort of this film. It's not the 1968 version, but it still very worthy of praise.",1150761600,4,3216,4.566724436741768
863856,3,630438551X,"Okay, this movie is the kind of movie you either love or hate.  For me it's okay but not the best.  I saw this in my english class and I thought it was hilarious.

Some good points are that it appeals to a younger audience (ex: teens) and it still sticks to Shakespare's words.  Also just watching it it's hilarious!  It takes place in modern times.  Instead of swords they have guns but when they say ""Put up your swords you know what to do,"" they zoom in on the gun and it says swords.  It thought it was hilarious.  Also Leo Dicapro is in it. Enough said.

Some bad things about the movie is that it just doesn't make sense.  I think Shakespare's probably rolling over in his grave.  The passion between Claire Danes and Leo Dicapro just isn't there.  Also many people really don't like how it's so out of place because it takes place in the 90s.  It kind of seems like a ""gangster"" movie.  And also the famous balcony scene, the scene I was toally looking forward to, was a total disappointment.

Anyway, I don't really criticize films because I'm the kind of person that either loves it or hates.  So overall this was okay.  I give it a C-.  But, like I said, you wither love this movie or hate it.  I would recommend the `68 version of Romeo and Juliet over this version, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet.",1147564800,,1315,4.315573770491803

This movie steps away from the traditional ideas of Romeo and Juliet and delivers something completely new.  Sure, seeing DiCaprio spouting Shakespeare takes a bit of getting used to, but once the original shock subsides the plot just takes over.

The amazing thing is that Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes actually manage it.  They pull it off!  Romeo and Juliet cease to be the protagonists of an archaic, dusty, old romance and become real people with real love.

One other thing, often overlooked: the music!  Each song is perfect for each scene - adding just enough, never distracting and never taking away.

Yes, the DiCaprio version is different, but that's exactly what Romeo and Juliet needed.",1147046400,4,906,4.6415094339622645

Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes star in the tragedy Romeo and Juliet. Comparing the old movie to Luhrman's, I can tell Zeffirelli's wersion is geared towards a much younger audience. Luhrman has done a great job attracting a younger audience to an oldtime classic and favourite. Ho attracts a younger audience by setting the movie in modern time, with gun fights and cars. I don't want people to get me wrong, but given the option to watch Zefirelli's version or Luhrman's, I would have to pick Luhrman's version hands down. If Shakespeare were aive today I believe that he would want to attract a muti-aged audience. This move has a liitle bit of everything for the audience. Those who enjoyed the old version, will enjoy the new movie because the actors speak in fifteenth century old english.

Garnished with colorful, neon settings and fairytale-like costumes, this film did a wonderful job of respecting Shakespeare's original dialogue. Backed up by a modern-day soundtrack, I highly recommend this film as an aid for teaching classic literature to today's youth.

The chemistry between Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) is the glue that holds this production together. Their playful, young love for one another is displayed perfectly throughout the film, and the colorful setting and props only add to the romance. I especially love the director's spin on the balcony scene, relocating it rather to Juliet's in-home pool.

As Juliet, Danes maintains a character of innocence with intelligence, a balance I think Shakespeare originally intended for the young Capulet. As Romeo, DiCaprio displays an ever-convincing soul torn by lovesickness - every lady's dream come true. Honestly, in all of his films, I've never seen the boy act so incredibly in love as in this movie. Their chemistry, combined with that of the full cast, makes this film truly unique in itself.

While some of the director's ""tweaks"" to the film may be too much to bear for the older generations, I think most people will find this film breathtaking, the way Shakespeare intended.",1142380800,2,1432,5.21304347826087

The scene: Verona Beach. The time: 20th Century. The meaning of the play: the same. Everyone knows that this Shakespeare classic is one of a kind. But, in the eyes of Baz Luhrmann, the director, this movie takes form. Funny scenes become hysterical. The Capulet party becomes outrageous. Everything matches in proportion. Nothing is missed. True, some scenes are taken out. Paris is alive by the end and Balthassar and Romeo don't fight right before his death. But, the form and meaning of the play stand tall.

863962,5,630438551X,"Out crusin' the busy streets of Verona.

The Montague boys are speeding in their car.

Not a care in the world.

They'd never notice a cluster of police cars

If they were to come up from behind.

Radio blaring and screaming at the top of their lungs.

Their fun has only just begun.

They'll never go home until the setting of the sun.

Never mind the cool wind blowing and the hair in their eyes.

They've got one life to live, so they're going to live it right.

They won't go down without a fight.

There's innocent blood to shed.

And lives to be lost.

Hold on tight you're in for the ride of your life!

Baz is at the helm.

He's got a classic story to tell.

A modern retelling that may keep you guessing.

If you only read parts of it while the teacher was looking.

This stories not over.

It's only just beginning.

Fasten your seatbelts!

Stopping at some pumps to get some fuel.

Man it feels good to wag school.

And behave nonchalantly.

Be disrespectful and act atrociously.

The Montague arch enemies pull up along side.

Be cool and let them be.

Or bight your thumb at them however -

Be prepared to draw your weapons and fight this duel with me.

It's too late the fued has commenced.

There is great unrest.

I fear I may not see my bed tonight.

For I'll be dead instead.

A bullet through the head.

Loathed enemy Tybolt is playing with matches.

To see how fast the petrol catches.

A spark and a fire is lit.

Run for your lives or get back in your cars.

There's no chance of escape.

Once death takes hold of your beating heart.

That'll be it.

It'll all be over.

The streets are ablaze with fire and petrol.

Gangs of families the Capulet's and Montagues

Are the cause of the fued.

Where many young lives are lost years before their time.

Someone must save us before the death toll rises.

And the streets are awash with blood and explosives.

Two families shooting their mouths off at each other with anger.

Biting their thumbs and pulling their guns triggers with vigor.

Someone better save us.

Hell has broken loose in the city streets of Verona.

God help us!

From out of the bright clear blue sky comes a police helicopter.

Like a giant wasp.

Get the spray quick smart.

Oh wait, it's the Prince!

Guns are drawn and cocked.

One false move and a bullet will get ya in a matter of seconds.

Throw your swords to the ground or suffer the concequences.

The swords fall to the road.

The fued is over.

It can go no further.

The helicopters deafening noise causes the families to pause.

No guns are reloaded.

Both families must sit in judgement.

The outcome will be anything but pleasant.

Contempt is the only word for it.

Death to those who attempt another fued like this.

No further questions.

The verdict has been reached.

Court is dismissed.

Later that day Romeo confides in his friend Benvolio

About his love the fair Roseline.

Alas he is out of luck with love for her.

What should he do?

Playing pool and watching the TV too, they both decide what to do.

A ball appears on the screen held at the Mansion of Capulet.

They're not invited but that doesn't matter.

They have connections and contacts.

No one would suspect them with a costume and mask.

They'd stay at the party and not be forced out the exits.

The party is a blast and Romeo forgets his past with Roseline.

His heart has been stolen by Juliet a Capulet.

A despised enemy.

Romeo goes for a spin around the room.

Romeo and Juliet exchange shocked glances.

After kissing and lusting the night away.

Could they be forbidden lovers.

The answer was incomprehensible.

Yes they unfortunately had to be.

Before all of the guests leave.

Romeo decides to flee and climb a tree.

Making his way into the private compounds of the Capulet Mansion.

At last he'd be able to tell Juliet what he had left unspoken.

Their families love may be renewed once they exchange their vows.

No more heated words would need to be spoken.

Once the young lovers kissed and frolicked in the pool.

And they'd said 'I do'.

Friar Lawrence spoke of their need to love moderately.

And not do anything rash.

He hoped they had heard him.

Otherwise their lives would surely end in death and disillusion.

For everything was not at ease in the hot humid sun of Verona Beach.

While Romeo + Juliet were blessed and at peace.

Mercutio was and Benvolio wasted time on the sand.

The situation was quickly becoming out of hand.

And Mercutio was dealt one final fatal blow.

A gash in his side.

There is nowhere to hide.

And as Benvolio keels over in the sand.

Romeo takes his hand.

Close to his ear Romeo hears Murcutio proclaim prophecies.

In a deathly silent whisper that moments before could be heard

in front of gathering crowds.

The clouds roll in.

'A plauge on both your houses'.

He chocks gasping at breath.

And then nothing.

The angels had taken him.

He was heaven sent.

This story will not end happily ever after.

Driving at night Romeo has Tybolt in his sights.

He will pay for taking Murcutio's life.

He'd gone too far.

There was no turning back.

Romeo careers into Tybolt's car at a frightening

break neck speed.

The Prince will not be pleased.

Tybolt's car flips onto it's roof, and glass showered the road.

Things are set to explode...

Light the fuse,

Pull the pin

And watch the chaos unfold.

Romeo loads his gun and in a sudden outbust of rage

He fires at Tybolt.

Tybolt's life is over.

Riddled with bullets he is thrust back into a pool of water.

Once clear now blood red.

Romeo must leave if he is smart.

Or stay and take his chances.

There is only one solution.

Romeo is banished.

He'd better vanish.

Seeking council with Friar Lawrence

The full force of Romeo's actions hit him.

Nothing will work if he begs and pleeds.

Not even if he gets down on his knees.

Romeo's fate is sealed.

If he doesn't take heed.

And disappear.

Romeo goes to Juliet.

His new bride.

A short marriage.

It had been indeed!

For one last night of passion and lovemaking.

All too soon light floods in through the windows.

It can't be morning yet.

Our lovemaking is far from over.

Come on baby.

Turn over.

Coiled together cosy in sheets.

Romeo gives Juliet long sweet kisses of desire.

She'll remember this forever and ever.

It had been a night to remember.

Then down to the streets Romeo dashed.

He hoped he hadn't forgotten his pants.

It'd always be Juliet that he fancied.

Away to Mantua Romeo must stay.

If he wants to live to see another day.

And have his bride reunited with him.

He'd never forget how cute Juliet looked.

In those sexy pink panties!

He'd remember the ring.

'I love thee'.

Those words would always ring true.

To the young couple who committed

the worst, most despicable sin.

But never again.

In a state of distress

Juliet goes to the friar.

Her parents want her to marry

the handsome wealthy Paris.

Juliet is anything but delighted.

She asks to be given remedy.

The Friar has just what she needs.

A fast working liquor that will leave her in a somber state.

Her lids closed four and twenty hours.

Then she'll be woken.

Romeo would be there to greet her.

All she had to do is drink if off after the setting of the sun.

And the plan will take effect.

The past violent occurances will have been nothing but a dream.

It all seemed pretty perfect.

The Friar arrives the following morning to the Capulet's mansion.

Tragedy has beset them.

Things are in total disarray.

Juliet can't possibly get married today!

He finds Juliet in a death like state.

The plan was working.

He'd send letters to Romeo to tell him of their foolproof scheme.

He only prayed that's he'd get them in time.

Before it was too late.

Romeo is visited at Mantua.

But happy news is not what the messenger is implying.

Juliet's life is over.

There was no letter.

Romeo must join her.

He travels back into Verona walls.

He's been spotted by a circling helicopter.

Romeo pays for a vile of poison.

So deadly it will send your temperature soaring.

His blood will be boiling.

Romeo then makes his way to the tomb enterance.

A gun in his hand he takes a prisoner hostage.

Any sudden moves and his brains would be

splattered in an ugly mess on the pavement.

Don't make him use this!

At last Romeo gets to the enterance unscathed.

He hurries inside to be greeted by darkness.

Except for Juliet's tomb.

Thousands of candles had all been lighted.

Romeo's resting place had been decided.

No one would ever spoil the love they shared between them.

After some astute observation of a face

Not yet ravaged by death.

Romeo seals his lips with a kiss.

The poison - He drinks it.

His life will soon be over.

Juliet opens her eyes and grasps Romeo's hand.

But it is too late.

He'd taken the poison.

Romeo's fatal action had been fulfilled.

The poison had worked.

Romeo's life was taken.

His soul was in heaven.

Under lock and key.

In God's possession.

His final sight Juliet's eyes staring back at him.

Oh if only he'd waited.

They'd be together once more.

Juliet could have saved him!

So Juliet takes his gun and points it at her head.

Things will never be the same.

Living a life heartbroken.

She pulls the trigger.

Sayonnara.

Before too long everyone will know.

Of the sad tragic tale of poor Juliet and her Romeo.

Thanks to a man called William Shakespere.

We salute you.

And a man called Baz Luhrmann.

The genius behind the camera.

To create this groundbreaking picture for us.

And Zefferelli never did confuse

And read the play more times than I would count,

Hearing Claire Daines regurgitate those words

Convinces me she's better played on mute.

863967,5,630438551X,"When watching this version of Romeo and Juliet people really need to stop comparing it to other films of Romeo and Juliet...especially the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey. One thing I will say for the 1968 version is that its Juliet was far more beautiful than Claire Danes.

Ok...I give this movie 5 stars. It was VISUALLY stunning! It was very vibrant and youthful and it truly captured the essense of YOUNG, immature love. That is what Romeo and Juliet felt for each other. It was not a truly substantial love because they only knew each other for a week before they decided they were ready to DIE for each other. That was just really STUPID and no NORMAL, MATURE human being would do something like that. However, it is a tragedy and I have learned to value the story and its message of love over hatred and all that stuff. The best scene, I feel, in the movie has to be the death scene. In no other Romeo and Juliet movie will you see the raw emotion and the tragic shift from joy to utter despair on Juliet's face when she realizes that her Romeo has just swallowed a deadly poison. It is probably only a minute or less, however, that one scene makes this movie. It is in that one scene that you see the true talent shine in Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes. Their performances up until that point are mediocre, but hey, what can you expect from modern kids acting out a script that is WAYYYYYYYYY before their time. Some of the executions of the lines were a little...dry and some were just plain HORRIBLE! The first words exchanged between Romeo and Juliet completely LACK any true emotion...it seems like their just...RECITING LINES! That should have been REDONE until it was perfect because it is SUCH an important part of the film. But, whatever. It's not like I was directing it...thanks MR. Luhrmann.

All in all...this movie is good. Probably my favorite Romeo and Juliet film because it introduced me to the tale and offered a very beautiful picture of it. I don't think that the past films achieved such beauty simply because the resources were not offered to them...so it was lucky to have been made recently because it drew upon good lighting, cars and guns, nice beaches, crazy black guys, tattooed stoners and leather-wearing bullies, and a killer soundtrack.

It's definitely not a classic portrayal of Shakespeare, but the way the Romeo and Juliet story is shown is so much more intriguing. It's a modern setting with the same Shakespearan language. I've seen this film many times and there's so much going on that I never get sick of it. Other reviews say that this portrayal is ludricous and just absurd, but I think it's clever and interesting. Think Westside Story with more energy and darkness. It's a different retelling and maybe it's not as ""classical"" as many purists would want, but it certainly is interesting.

I think Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are great in this movie. They're great as these two star-crossed lovers who are conflicted between family obligation and love. They're young and youthful and do a great job. The only thing that bothered me was that Juliet's mother seems to change completely overnight. First, she's crazy and frantic and the next, she's subdued and proper. It's a minor detail and you probably won't even notice it.

It's a fresh, more youthful interpretation and teenage viewers will probably like it more, but everyone should see it at least once. Just to see a different interpretation of a classic story.

Great movie.",1135900800,3,1233,4.885167464114833
864018,2,630438551X,"The story of the Capulets and the Montagues has never looked like this before.  Baz Luhrmann has created an updated version of this timeless classic.  Often considered the perfect tragic love story, Romeo and Juliet proves that Shakespeare was an outstanding playwright and a master wordsmith.  Unfortunately, even the best writing cannot carry a movie when the actors have no passion nor innate skill.

  Leonardo DiCaprio has just the right look to play young Romeo, but he lacks any true acting ability.  He takes some of the most passionate lines ever written and plows through them like a bull in a china shop, determined to just get through and get out as quickly as possible.  Take for example the scene when Romeo first speaks to Juliet.  ""If I offend with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this...""  DiCaprio delivers these lines with no emotion, no passion, and no apparant thought for what he is actually saying.  This soulless acting continues throughout the film.

  Claire Danes is better, but not much.  She is far more convincing than her counterpart, but the lines still come across flat.

  Not all this is the fault of the actors.  The director is ultimately responsible and that brings us to Baz Luhrmann.  Cinematically, this film is impressive.  He's done a wonderful job of updating the play to modern times without tying it directly to any particular period or location.  The creative way that he introduced the ""Dagger"" (now a semi-automatic pistol) and the ""long sword"" (a rifle) are proof that Luhrmann does care about the details.  If only he cared a little more about the acting, and worked a little harder to draw forth a more passionate performance from his stars.

  Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version is a vastly superior performance from an artistic point of view; however, Luhrmann's updated version provides a version that the youth of today will probably connect with.  If the goal is to get kids to watch and appreciate Shakespeare, then show this version first.  Once they're hooked, have them watch the 1968 version and show them what Shakespeare was really meant to be.",1135900800,,2130,4.907303370786517
864019,4,630438551X,"If you've scrolled through the reviews, you see that many are divided between thinking it is absolute garbage and thinking it is a masterpiece. The movie requires an open-minded person in order to appreciate it. Otherwise it will make no sense and seem like such rubish as to be worth dirt.

At first the contradicting dialogue really threw me off. When they called for everyone to ""draw your swords"" and instead pulled out guns, it bothered me. People wearing hawaiian shirts and shouting Shakespeare in a gas station look strange; they really do. But after the initial shock, I began to simply accept things and relate to them.

Romeo and Juliet came to life for me, and I understood that Shakespeare's plays are meant to be seen, not read.

The entire modern setting is like a metaphor. You won't understand unless you alter your way of thinking. You CAN'T go in with any EXPECTATIONS. I think that's what gets people, is the expectations and the contradicting dialogue.

Leonardo did NOT play his part lifelessly or without emotion. A normal person with no acting skill does that. It is not easy to get before a camera like that and play out Shakespeare. The actors had to give it their own style in order for things to work, because there was no improvising and every line was essential and if the actors didn't like it- too bad. I felt that the two actors really brought the characters to life, and for once it seemed to me that Romeo and Juliet really were in love! When you're reading the play it seems ridiculous that two people could ever just suddenly love each other, but somehow it felt that way in the movie. It worked because of their expressions, their tones, and the atmosphere, all things that you simply don't get when reading it. Romeo and Juliet the book would never have survived so long, but Romeo and Juliet the play is a story that will go on and on through the ages and still inspire the same tragic awe.

Lastly, the ending was altered. In the script Romeo dies and then Juliet wakes, but in the movie she wakes just before he dies. The lines are all the same, except that two are switched so that the two lovers actually interact for a brief moment before dying. I am personally too wrapped up in frustration each time to care (it all just has to happen like one big and horrible coincidence), but I can see why that would bother people.

All in all, the visualization was good and had a unique feel to it, like almost everything is candle lit, even on the beach. The water imagery was wonderful and added so much more signifigance to the story. The characters were well portrayed and I found myself seeing more into them than I did when reading.

The movie is only confusing if you keep fighting against it. You can only appreciate it if you take it all in and accept it. Watch it once and then think it over. That's the least this movie deserves.",1135641600,,2876,4.498084291187739
864020,1,630438551X,"...but the best I can come up with is that everyday jargon: stupid.

From the cover, I was expecting a setting somewhere in Europe and during the Middle Ages or so. But the cover was misleading.

I did not like the movie since the beginning. The whole mafia/gangster scene reminded me of a typical Monty Python humor--stupid--but I thought it would get better in time. It didn't. The first scene was a stupid scene, as was the rest of the movie. If the director did it on purpose in an attempt to mock... something... I guess I'm just losing my sense of humor because I did not laugh (at least not *with* him).

Claire Danes looked sweet and innocent at first, but for some reason or other she ticked me off the wrong way. Maybe it was the way she grinned. Maybe it was the way her character could not even afford a bra in spite of her wealth. (Incidentally, wasn't Claire Danes 17 or so during the making of the movie? Was it legal for her to take off her clothes in front of the camera? Wouldn't that be child pornography?)

Finally, while I'm never going to be a qualified judge of art of any form, I'm pretty sure the way Leonardo DiCaprio recited his lined would be just the way I would--which is to say, badly and without any emotion.

So yeah, I guess I've gone off-tangents and failed to support my thesis that the movie is stupid. But seriously, you'll agree it is stupid once you see it. That is, unless you have a thing for either Leo or Claire or both.",1135036800,3,1464,4.3090909090909095
864021,5,630438551X,"After peeking at the reviews already written for this movie, I thought that perhaps I could share my two cents.

First of all, no. This is not set in the 16th century. This is not in Italy. They do not use actual swords (though if you watch, most of their guns are named after the classic 16th century weaponry).

However, that's not what Baz Luhrmann was after. He wanted to take the story and, with as few script/theme/feeling changes as possible, make it present day. He wanted to show audiences the timelessness of the story, the ways in which it still could apply to modern times and modern people. He managed to create a feud between two families that seemed a real and common part of these characters' lives, while still managing to convey a true love story. Some may think that the love is too playful, too childish, but that's what Shakespeare wrote! Juliet was supposed to be so much younger than she is in this (but, again, to make this fit with present day, someone of marrying age needed to be used), and the love is between two young people who are just learning what love really is.

I love the film. I think the soundtrack and the setting work well together, giving a 1990's feel to the story, but Luhrmann's attention to phrasing, to detail, amazes the watcher with its Shakespearean accuracy.

The move is worth an open mind, if nothing else. Even for those who don't ""get"" Shakespeare, or maybe especially for them, this is a way to appreciate his story without a freshman English teacher or a lot of confusion.",1134172800,2,1530,4.552727272727273

The version with Clair and Leo is my very favorite. why? it nicely contemporises everything in the world of verona italy, making the characters seem more real and understanding than ever before.

Leo and Clair's chemistry is to die for as the pair cuddle in bed the morning after their wedding night . ..

""Then let me be taken! let me be put to death! i have more care to stay than will to go! come death and welcome! juliet wills it so!""

and when romeo and juliet meet for the first time at the party, they see each other through the opposite sides of a fish tank and the flirting is heart melting.

""Did my heart love til now?"" romeo whispers to himself as he watches juliet dance reluctantly with her future fiancee.

Mercutio gives an outstanding performance and is the most memorable mercutio yet. he brings the character to life and is more real and vibrant almost than anyother charcter in the play. in other words, he steals the spotlight and runs with it.

864094,1,630438551X,"I have never in my life had such contempt for a movie like I have for William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Whoever thought this take on the timeless classic was worth making should be locked up in a mental institution for the rest of his or her life.  That person is a danger to society!

There have been modern interpretations of Shakespeare that have worked, and worked well:  10 Things I Hate About You is a new telling of Taming of the Shrew, while O is a reinterpretation of Othello.  Both take the heart of Shakespeare and present it in an all-modern setting and dialogue, and this works to both films' advantage.  If someone wanted to update Romeo and Juliet, the settings and the actors would have benefitted much from snappy, modern, urban dialogue

.  It would have been grand.

Instead, we're presented with original Shakespearian words mouthed (badly) by a cast of MTV-wannabes who wouldn't know Shakespeare from Barney the dinosaur!  At fault is the director, who decided that because DiCaprio was on every teen magazine that he should be Romeo.  Bad move.  Did he even check this guy's credits?  Total Eclipse?  Critters 3?  Forgettable movies at best.  DiCaprio has a smug sense that he's so good he can pull off anything, but he clearly has NO grasp of sophisticated dialog, so he pretty much rambles out what he's given and hopes his looks carries it off.  Sorry, Leo.  Don Rickles could do better than you with the part.  Brian Denehey is totally WASTED in a brief role as Montague (I'm sure he's thankful that his screen time is equivalent to an eyeblink--I would be), and the rest of the no-talent cast sleepwalk through a sorrowful script aimed at being too hip for its own good.  Only Claire Danes seems to grasp that she should take something of this seriously, but she, too, starts to flounder badly halfway through the picture.  What with Lady Capulet snorting coke, and Mercutio ranting as if he's just been channeling Bobcat Goldwaithe, how could anyone hope to be drawn into this movie?  Terrible from beginning to end.

The 1968 Franco Zeferelli version of the play, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, was a classic, and it showed exactly how Shakespeare should be presented.  Lush, beautiful, touching--it is nearly the perfect movie.  Everything it was is what the 1996 version fails on ALL levels to be.  Everything is overblown and plain bad:  set design, music, the opening credits, the closing credits, the cast, the box the movie comes in.  There is no redeeming value to this version save one.  If you want your money's worth, the only was to achieve this is to buy the movie (VHS or DVD), douse it with gasoline or any flammable material, and burn it completely up.  A TOTAL waste of time.  Rent or buy something better--namely ANYTHING ESLE (even a Corey Haim movie--at least you can laugh at it).

A parting thought:  Romeo and Juliet is a sad, tragic play with what may be the first real ""tear-jerker"" ending.  Watching the 1968 Zeferelli version, I found myself lingering on the ending wishing there had been a way for the ""star-crossed lovers"" to have made it in the end.  What was my thoughts as the climax of Romeo + Juliet approached?  What the hell is Romeo waiting for?  He's got a gun.  Why doesn't he shoot himself?  Poison's WAY too quick!  And go ahead and make sure Juliet's really dead before you off yourself.  (This is NOT how we should think of the play, but this version'll make you do it.)",1127952000,4,3503,4.6957236842105265

864096,4,630438551X,"I think a lot of reviews of this film have been unduly harsh. I have had a fair amount of Shakespearean exposure (I was an English major in college), and I am actually impressed with Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the text.  Some people are so blinded by the seeming erudite stuffiness of Shakespeare's work that they forget what this play is really about.  `Romeo and Juliet' is a teenage melodrama!  With that said, this film works well.

* To begin with, Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes come off just right as the ""star-crossed lovers.""  They handle their lines - perhaps - a bit awkwardly, and their key scenes are overacted.  But as far as I'm concerned, their somewhat `poor' performances are actually perfect.  In the reality of the play - Romeo and Juliet's behavior (though arguably passionate) is less than genuine.  They are young, fickle, and full of hormones, and what might seem like acts of heart-felt love and desire are actually just curious explorations of subversive behavior.

* Many have lamented that the dialogue in this film (essentially) mirrors the original text ... but changing the text (in any major way) would be a huge mistake.  Shakespeare's plays are not famous because they have a great story line - they are famous because of the unbelievable writing.  It would, therefore, be pointless to modernize the dialogue.  Shakespeare's plays ARE the dialogue.

* Although this film - compared with other renditions of the play - is decidedly modern, certain elements do contribute to a sort of timely ambiguity.  The cars, guns, drugs, and music suggest 1996 (or thereabouts), whereas the gothic mansions, the ball, the feuding families, and the oppressive presence of the Church seem somewhat anachronistic.  I think this ambiguity speaks to the universality of Shakespeare's work.  Does it even matter when this play takes place?  Have hot-blooded teenagers changed that much over the years?

* Lastly, the ambience of Lurhmann's film is intoxicating: zipping, choppy cinematography, an over-abundance of gaudy electric lighting, and an intriguing soundtrack.  It's very titillating in an adolescent sort of way.  Anyone who does not find the scene - where DiCaprio is dragging on a cigarette against an orangey sunscape, with Radiohead's ""Talk Show Host"" slowly pulsing in the background - sentimentally sexy - well, you must not remember what it's like to be 15.

All in all, this is an ingenious approach to a classic text - not to mention an entertaining film.",1126742400,210,2498,5.04390243902439

To say it's a modern adaptation doesn't really describe it - it's more like a pantomime version with Montagues and Capulets not just as rival gangs but as owners of the town, with their respective names in lights on tall buildings.  Its only insight is into the producer's self-aggrandisement.  Yuk!",1126569600,2,476,4.686746987951807

Granted that some of the actors have Shakespeare skills that are, to be charitable, sketchy.  Still this movie catches the spirit of a Shakespeare play better than any other movie  know.

If it is a flawed movie, we might as well begin by recognizing that it is a flawed play, often overrated.  My favorite teacher observed that it isn't even a tragedy: it is a comedy gone wrong.  Comedies are about young lovers who intrigue to outsmart their elders.  R&J do exactly that, and fail to get away with it only through the barest accidents.  Likewise, tragedy is about character and R&J cannot be about character because they are too young to have any character.  R&J does have some glorious verse-some of the best Shakespeare ever wrote-but it has far too many strained couplets and near-pointless wordplay.

But put all that aside.  Where Shakespeare succeeds magnificently (perhaps for the first time in his career) is in creating a coherent moral universe.  This is a play about hot bloods and itchy trigger fingers and the passion of first love.

You can tell that Shakespeare understood it this way from the way he altered his sources.  In the sources, Juliet is 18 or 16; here she is just 13.  A source extends the story over nine months; Shakespeare compresses it to a week (""you won't believe what happened while you were away..."").  A source makes the death of Tybalt mere accident; in the play, Romeo is inculpated.  All this creates the air of urgency and danger that the movie captures so well.

Given all this appeal, it is unfortunate the characters' approach to the verse is, ahem, uneven.  Pete Postlethwaire made himself completely at home with Friar Lawrence.  Miriam Margolyes rather hams it up as Juliet's nurse, but then Shakespeare more or less wrote it that way.  Some of the smaller parts-Benvolio, Old Capulet-are little marvels of characterization.  Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is, unfortunately, a devil's bargain: the camp cross-dressing is a hoot, but the casting means that the strongest speeches fall to the weakest speaker.  Claire Danes looks her part as Juliet and can almost get her mouth around it.  Leonardo Di Caprio is himself, but -well, would we like it any better with Tom Cruise?

In any event, there is so much to enjoy here that it is possible to forgive the shortcomings.  Not the best possible Romeo & Juliet, but it will do nicely until a better one comes along.",1123804800,6,2561,4.746031746031746

When I was in High School in the mid 90's, my English class read the original Romeo & Juliet play by Shakespeare and then after we read the play, we watched the 1936 Black & White film and I just totally loved it for the acting and drama, and it was romantic and followed the play very well. Now Romeo & Juliet is my favorite Shakespeare play!!

A while after this 1996 film was released, when it came to video stores to rent, I decided to rent it. I thought it would be good because I liked Claire Danes and Leonardo in other shows and movies.

I hate to talk so negatively about a film based on Shakespeare's masterpiece but I have to be honest!! This film should NOT have William Shakespeare's name in the title. I was very, very appalled by the very, very drastic changes they made to what Shakespeare meant it to be!

Here are some things in this version that just made me sick:

1. The dialog does not match what you see on screen. There is this line ""drop your sword."" Hello?? They were carrying guns!!! I mean, come on!!! If You're going to makes changes to a play, at least do it right!!!

2. The guns!! Nowhere in Shakespeare's masterpiece play does it mention the characters with guns!! They had swords and daggers, not guns!!

3. The rock, alternative, and dance music does not fit, it's meant to be classical!!

4. The famous balcony scene was a total disgrace!! Romeo is supposed to be right below Juliet's balcony and Juliet is supposed to be up at her balcony when she says the famous ""Romeo, Romeo, Where For Art Thou Romeo?"" They totally messed this up in the 1996 film when Juliet says that line only when she says it, she is walking right by Romeo on the ground where he was!! I was really, really looking forward to the famous balcony scene the way Shakespeare meant it to be right before I saw the part in this 1996 version but I was so appalled that they killed the scene!!

5. Claire Danes and Leonardo didn't have enough emotion and passion to be Romeo & Juliet overall!! The couple romantic scenes this film did have, it was alright but I expect superb acting and drama between the two star crossed lovers!!!

6. This 1996 film was ruined from the very beginning with the newscaster and TV!!

7. There were cars in this film!! There were NO cars in Romeo & Juliet!!!

8. I felt like I was watching a Ganster film and not a romantic film overall. I mean, there was a feud between the two families in the play but this film took it way too far like when they were always shooting and killing each other, to an extent that made me feel like I was watching more Ganster than Romance!

9. There is acid using in this film!! People using acid drugs?? Oh my god, I feel so sorry for Shakespeare, so sorry that his masterpiece play is being treated this way!! I just cannot comprehend how they could treat his legacy like this!! I am just so, so appalled beyond words!

The only saving factor in this, is they kept the old english words/dialog and a couple of Romeo & Juliet romantic scenes but I will stick to the REAL Romeo & Juliet films, the 1936 Black & White and the 1968 version, those are REAL Romeo & Juliet adaptions that don't disgrace and disrespect Shakespeare!",1123632000,3,3438,4.329704510108865

Yes, the movie is modernized, but then again, it isn't. The use of Shakespeare for the script instead of a modernized script while at the same time updating Verona to the present day feels very dreamlike, like it isn't even happening on the planet.

DiCaprio and Danes were perfect for these roles. I've seen too many movies from R&J and there was simply NO chemistry. That's not the case here. The lines aren't arch reproductions, ""same old same old"" stuff. The lines are spoken with frightening immediacy. This is important, because most remakes of this movie are far too elegant. This version captures the chaotic, euphoric passion of love that simply will not wait or be denied. The lines aren't just spoken, they elbow and push their way on to the screen. This is a major plus.

Claire Danes is simply gorgeous. Hers is a unique kind of beauty. Not typical Hollywood fare. Another plus.

The only scenes I had trouble with were the first scene with the Capulet and Montague boys meeting at the gas station, and the first scene with Lady Capulet and Juliet.

I highly recommend this movie because, even though we all know the story, this movie still finds a way to be just as fresh as the first time we read/saw the play.

864181,5,630438551X,"Luhrmann's film is a modernised and very effective remake of the original Zeffirelli film.  The story of Romeo and Juliet, written by William Shakespeare, has now been shunted into a whole new dimension.  The original story is a thoroughly depressing tragedy, where two people from opposing families fall in love.  They get married in secret but after Romeo kills Juliet's cousin for stabbing his best friend.  He flees and Juliet's father tries to force her to marry another person she has hardly even talked to.  However to avoid this she fakes her death by drinking a sleeping potion.  Romeo comes back to find her `dead', and kills himself.  She wakes up, finds him dead next to her and stabs herself.  The grim reaper has his hands full with this one.

This film illustrates this story effectively, although to bring it into a modern setting, some clever changes have had to be made.  The beginning chorus is now narrated by a newsreader which I feel was a flash of inspiration as it is a brilliant way round having to have a narrator and sets the scene to the style of the film.  Some of the characters also have been updated to fit with the modern setting.  The Prince is now Chief Prince who is the sheriff of the city.  Also the two families are equally successful businesses with equal tower offices with equally huge signs with their respective names on the top.  All of these changes however help to make the film considerably more plausible in a modern setting.

Some very clever camera angles and shots are used to create a western style showdown, at a downtown petrol station.  Guns, of course, are switched from swords in the updating process, meaning that fight scenes would be a lot shorter if it weren't for Luhrmann's imagination.  Clever close-ups show the guns actually have names that would have been given to swords, an interesting bit of comedy to fit the story line.  Of course the show-off gun spinning and throwing goes with the western showdown, but fast camera shots give the whole sequence incredible speed.  This also adds a little comic effect, if it doesn't make you dizzy!  The sequence also has excellent background sound that really contributes to the pace and style of it.  The Zeffirelli edition had shockingly dressed people prancing around in psychedelic tights, poking each other with pathetic swords, whereas this version is infinitely more polished and acceptable to a modern audience.  Thankfully Zeffirelli's dreadful costumes have been dropped in place of even brighter Hawaiian shirts and gun holsters.  This fight soon turns into a full city riot thanks to the petrol station getting torched.

After a few sweeping skyline shots showing the urban landscape of the city and the towers, the film presentation turns into a news item about the incident showing Chief Prince swooping down in his chopper and saving the day.  Then both heads-of-house are given a dressing down by Chief Prince.  However this seems to have one fatal flaw.  The Chief warns them `on pain of death' which seems unrealistic, as the death penalty these days is saved for only the worst criminals, not squabbling families.  Also he would need to go through months of legal proceedings.  Zeffirelli gives the Prince a lot more authority in his version as the camera is pointing up to him on his horse from below.  However, Luhrmann loses this effect by pointing the camera straight at him on the level with him sat down at a desk.  Zeffirelli must have chosen the heaviest horse for the Prince he could find for this sequence because when it moves, the sound of its hooves drowns out the Prince.  All you need is it to be sufficiently ugly and the ground to shake and Godzilla's back in town

Later in the film we come to the famous balcony scene, of which through most the balcony is nowhere to be seen as the swimming pool seems to have been cast for that part instead.  Romeo abandons his party of drugged up and drunk friends and proceeds to break in to the Capulet mansion which, given their status, has surprisingly low security.  He arrives in the pool area and hears the door opening.  Leaping on to the trellis next to it in a tacky suit of armour from the party, making a ridiculous amount of noise, he manages to stay out of sight of Juliet as she comes out.  She then starts to talk to herself as per the first sign of insanity.  Romeo eases his way off the trellis and follows her, behind her back about an inch away.  This is totally unbelievable as at that distance she would definitely know he was there.  Plus his head was practically resting on her shoulder.  I just hope for her sake he has not got bad breath.  When he speaks to her, she leaps out of her skin and grabs him, and the resulting scream and splash into the swimming pool is just sheer comedy.  The camera zooms out just in time to see both lovers plummet into the pool.  Then he does a bit of explaining as to why he was hiding there and they seem to get on fine thereafter.  To emphasize the urgency of the situation the camera switches between the two rapidly.  Then the nurse comes out and calls for Juliet, who rudely proceeds to drown Romeo until she goes away.  Not bad for a first date.  Zeffirelli just has the sound of the nurse calling whereas I feel seeing her is far more interesting and engaging.  Romeo then begs for a kiss and wanders off.  Zeffirelli does this sequence far better having Romeo running through the trees with the camera flying alongside him with the trees in zipping past in front of him, although everybody watching is wishing for a tree to take out either the camera or Romeo.  Surprisingly Luhrmann had Juliet in a fairly modest dress in this scene whereas Zeffirelli's was probably arrestably revealing at that time.

Luhrmann has done a brilliant job on this film updating it and presenting it to the modern audience.  The setting of the film is in an excellent location to portray the film, with scenes that fit with every aspect of the play.  He has used music in this play very well to compliment the scenes, whereas Zeffirelli's drowned out the characters and was just too distracting.  The only criticism of the play I have is that I find the language is harder to understand for a modern audience and so does not fit with the modern setting.  However if it was updated I am sure the play would be considerably shortened given Shakespeare's wonderful talent of fabricating the dialogue to a ridiculous extent.  Also it would ruin the character of the play and some of the effect would be lost.  The actors interact with each other very well in this film and show friendship and hate far better than Zeffirelli, who had Tybalt just aimlessly smiling at everybody for no apparent reason.  On the whole the film is a fabulous adaptation of one of Shakespeare's greatest plays",1116115200,7,6816,4.64578111946533

My cousin did tell me that it was a good movie, but I still didn't believe it until I saw it for myself, and I was so impressed. Very impressed. The whole acting with the Dicaprio guy and Claire Danes was really good and I liked the fact that they still used the same old, English that the story was originally written in. That took a lot of hard work to memorize all those old English lines, while putting a modern day spin on it. That shows good acting ability, and I was truly impressed. Tybalt's character played by that John Leguizamo guy was the best! His portrayal was dead on with the character being the mean, spiteful, malicious, and antagonistic person that he was. Everything was good from the very beginning until the end. Never boring once, just really good acting and drama with a modern day spin to one of the most famous, entertaining Shakespearan play.

864245,4,630438551X,"Ever since the tale of two star-cross'd lovers whose untimely deaths brought peace to their two feuding families was written by the Bard, I'm willing to bet that no one ever thought it would be told like this; the story is set in modern day Verona Beach, with the Montagues and the Capulets as warring business men/gangs, whose kinsmen carry guns rather than swords (although each gun has a different type of sword name carved into it, such as dagger, rapier, and longsword).

I won't spend too much time talking about the story, seeing as how most people reading this review know the story backwards and forwards. Basically, the Montagues and the Capulets are two families that have been locked in a bloody feud for so long that no one remembers who/what started the fighting. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the only son of Lord (or in the film, Ted) Montague (Brian Dennehy), while Juliet (Claire Danes) is Lord (Fulgencio) Capulet's (Paul Sorvino) only daughter. The two meet and it is love at first sight. The next day, Friar Lawrence (Pete Postlethwaite) marries the pair. Sadly, tragedy strikes and Romeo is banished from the city. The friar gives Juliet a special potion that puts her into such a deep sleep that everyone thinks that she's dead... even Romeo (due to a mix-up in the mail). Ok, I am going to ""reveal"" the ending, so for the one or two of you who don't know the ending, just skip ahead a few lines. So, distraught over the ""death"" of his one true love, Romeo buys a very potent poison so that he can be with his love in death. Juliet finds him next to her when she wakes up, and she kisses him, then stabs, or in this version, shoots herself.

I remember when this movie came out almost 10 years ago, and there was a lot of controversy over it due to the fact that people were taking such a beloved story and placing it in modern times while still keeping Shakespeare's original dialogue. Personally, I thought it was great as a kind of juxtaposition; it was interesting to see people in modern-day California speaking Shakespearian English. The cast, for the most part, was perfect. Dennehy and Sorvino were great in their roles as the family patriarchs, John Leguizamo was a perfect Tybalt (a very over-the-top performance for a very over-the-top character), and Postlethwaite's Friar Lawrence was my second favorite of the characters in this film. I've only seen this guy in a few movies, but he is definitely a great actor (and you have to give this movie props for using Kobyashi). Harold Perrineau, Jr. was a pretty good Mercutio, although the writers made his character a little bizarre for my tastes, but for the most part, he played Mercutio the way he should have been played. My favorite character though, was Juliet. Claire Danes is one of the few actresses who could pull off Juliet; Juliet is not supposed to be ""hot"", she is supposed to be ""beautiful"" (yes, there is a difference), and there aren't a lot of women in Hollywood who have the level of beauty that is required to play Juliet Capulet (I think that if this movie was made now, my Juliet of choice would be Scarlett Johansson, but even today, Danes could still pull off the part). Danes is also a great actress who successfully brought Juliet's innocence, passion, and love to the screen as few actresses can. And what can I say, she is BEAUTIFUL, so she definitely gets my vote for favorite.

However, there were a few people that I thought could have been cast better. One of them, sadly, was Romeo himself. In some of his movies that have come out lately, DiCaprio has proven he has talent (I thought he was perfect in the role of Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Catch Me If You Can), but I feel as if this was too early in his career to play a character such as Romeo Montague. Oh well. Also, I hated the Lady Capulet of the film, played by Diane Venora. She was shrill, and her voice kept slipping in and out of a southern accent (although maybe I'm biased because I hate that character so much).

Also, apparently, there were a lot of actors in this movie who would either go on to (somewhat) bigger things or become guest stars on popular shows. The list includes Jamie Kennedy (of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment), Harriet Samson Harris (Bebe Glazer on Frasier), Vincent Laresca (Hector Salazar on 24), and Jesse Bradford (who's been in some kids' movies).

The visuals of the movie were excellent, and the music seemed to accentuate the story. Another great aspect was the whole water theme that they used.  And I must say that the filmmakers really went the whole nine yards when making this movie.  Even the billboards were written in Shakespearian dialogue, and many of them had quotes from other plays by the Bard.

While some stuff was omitted (no big plot points of course, just some dialogue here and there), it is to be expected. However, one of the most famous lines wasn't used, which really surprised me. It was Juliet's famous ""Oh happy dagger, this is your sheath!"". I'm going to guess that it was because they don't use swords in the movie, they used guns. Although (another ""spoiler""), Mercutio's gun was named dagger, so I thought that Romeo should have used his gun to avenge him when he killed Tybalt. Therefore, Romeo would still have it with him, and Juliet would use the ""dagger"" gun to kill herself.

There is one thing, though, that didn't translate well when the play is brought to our time.  I find it very hard to believe that such rich and materialistic people wouldn't have cell phones, which would have saved the lives of Romeo and Juliet.  I'm not complaining, because they needed to do it for the sake of the story, but as I said, it is a little hard to believe.

Ok, one last ""spoiler"". They changed the ending ever so slightly (yes, they both still die); if I remember correctly, in the original version, Romeo is dead before Juliet wakes up, so the last time they see each other alive is before Romeo leaves the city. In this version, just as Romeo takes the poison, Juliet wakes up and they see each other alive for the last time which (and my Shakespeare friends will probably kill me for saying this) I personally loved, and even before I saw this movie, I always thought would have been a cool ending (don't misinterpret this; I don't think I'm a better writer than Shakespeare).

This version is definitely not for everyone. Some people may not like it because they are Shakespeare scholars who feel as if the story has been corrupted, while others just may not get it. However, I would advise seeing this movie at least once. Personally, I found this movie to be a refreshing experience, and I really enjoyed it.",1108252800,3,6644,4.59662447257384

1. It is a love story, and not just a run of the mill love story, but a great one. I am mush when it comes to this type of stuff.

2. I see beauty in ruoghness, destruction, pain, misery, and tragedy. By placing it in a modern time the effect of the roughness is much greater for me than it would have been in period costume. I think that the director did an amazing job in adapting the story to the modern scene.

3. Along with the roughness comes the contrasting beauty of love and of Romeao and Juliet. Esthetically, both DiCaprio and Danes make a beautiful pair. The acting could have been better, but this is not to say that it was bad. Just subpar.

4. Mercucio was amazing.

5. The old English hit me hard the first time I saw it. It didn't quite fit at first but after half the movie I got so used to it that after the movie I was speaking old English myself. Actually, I shouldn't call it old English since Shakespear is considered to have written in modern English. A technicality. I liked the contrast.

Overall, I loved the contrasts in this movie. They lingled my senses. Like I said, this movie is not for everyone. Some people are traditionalists and they might not like the modernization of the movie. On the other hand, this movie opens up the world of Shakespear to a crowd that would not have paid attention otherwise. I personally think that the movie was done beautifully. I think that maybe I would look at it more as I would at a painting than a movie. But it depends what you like. This movie is graphic and violent. Maybe a bit overly violent. I like that.

The concept of keeping the same early modern english language and putting it into our times seems absolutely nonsensical, but I found it the oppostie, where in fact it is more clear to understand the language when it is set to something that would appear familair to us.

The actors are actually fantastic, a young Leo and Claire make the perfect teenage Romeo and Juliet who were supposed to be about 14 anyway.  They look as innocent and in love as Shakespeare intended it.  I really liked Claire Danes as Juliet because you were watching Juliet, you weren't watching a famous actress play Juliet, you know?

While Baz Lurmahns direction style canbe a bit eccectric, it certainly isn't as flashy as Moulin Rouge but still, the color and camera shots are sensational.  I'd see this film for the scenery and sets, etc alone.

864404,5,630438551X,"We have been watching this movie in our eighth grade English class, as well as reading the play Romeo and Juliet, as well as meeting with our Shakespearean expert who just happens to work at our school to act out scenes. Not only that, but we have also been studying the Shakespeare's time period. That being said, let me also say that Shakespeare was not this serious man who didn't understand comedy. In fact it was quite the opposite. True, Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy but is a comedy as well. That's how most of his works are. An example of this is how he would cast men as women. Just the sight of this would bring laughs from the audience. With all that understood, the movie Romeo and Juliet is a great adaptation.
We have only watched the first 30 minutes, and I might add more to this review once we finish it, or when I get the DVD, whichever comes first! But I loved the newscaster as the chorus. What a  creative touch. As for the swords or guns controversy, this is set in modern times. Who uses swords in our day? But to keep the Old English was smart. After all, what is Romeo and Juliet without Old English? It would not be the same. I mean, the famous Queen Mab's speech in anything but Old English? Hard to imagine. And te contrast between Old English and modern times was a very interesting one. And even if it was written in today's language, it would be too much like West Side Story. They wanted to stick to the roots of Romeo and Juliet. Also for all those people who criticized Mercutio for being a drag queen, he is not a drag queen or a transvestite. Well what can I say? This is the modern version. The performance given by Leonardo DiCaprio is great, he speaks Old English like he's spoken it his entire life. However Juliet, I don't quite agree with. I don't think she brought her best to this film. The acting isn't the best and she looks quite bland compared to Romeo, who is quite handsome, and I don't really understand the whole Cuban thing with Juliet's family.
All in all, a great film, one that must be seen with an open mind, otherwise don't even bother to watch it at all. It was filmed to show today's fourteen year old's that yes, Shakespeare lived in the 1600's and true, Romeo and Juliet takes place in the 1400's but it has a universal message of love, one that can still be understood today, even if it is 2004.",1077926400,2,2358,4.3108108108108105

However, after developing a love for the performing arts and actually reading shakespeare, I have developed an appreciation for this movie that is hard to explain to the casual viewer.
  I believe that Baz Luhrman's take on this is brilliant!  Mercutio steals the show, but is only highlighted by his introduction and death scene (which is the pivotal point of the story).  Teenage angst and true love that no grown-up can remember experiencing rules the roost here.  Guns are brilliantly substituted for swords and daggers, and the word-play is only enhanced by the film's use of the cast's modern nuances.  I find myself watching this every couple of months and loving it!
  As for the director's use of Shakespeare's dialogue, I belive it is nothing short of genius.

It calls to the audience with the violence and sex that Shakespeare needed to include to capture the audience in his time, and what remains to capture audiences today.
What's most amazing is Baz Luhrmann's twist to not only apply today's world view of Shakespeare, but also to captures it with the original context and language of Shakespeare, and this is what makes this movie truly amazing.  Audiences that have never read Shakespeare and don't understand the language of that day can still love and understand the movie, can still understand what's going on.
This movie has a chilling score on top of that.  Every scene fully captures the beauty because of a score that brings out the emotion.
The cinematography was exciting and vibrant.  The crew worked hard to bring Shakespeare to resurrect Shakespeare to the modern world in set as well as in script.  Details were added to the movie that most won't catch until they watch the special features of this DVD.

The main thing is that you'll probably only enjoy the movie if (a) modernised Shakespeare is something you're happy with (b) you can make the suspension of disbelief required to accept modern-day people talking in Shakespearean dialogue.  If you don't feel like you could accept these things, then you'd probably be better renting another movie.
The camera work and overall presentation is extremely dramatic, sometimes over-dramatic, and again, enjoyment depends on personal taste.  In my opinion, the camera work mostly produces a vibrant, emotional experience, but at times you do want to just grab the camera and stop it moving so you can take the scenes in more slowly!  Again, though, if you are prepared to accept dramatic camera work, it isn't much of a problem - but if you prefer traditional filming techniques, this one would rather annoy you.
The actors are adequate - Claire Danes does well with the rather anodyne role of Juliet, DiCaprio is a tolerable Romeo, and Pete Postlethwaite is excellent as Friar Lawrence.  Again, at times some performances dip into the melodramatic side, but others are surprisingly sensible.
I have taken a star off mainly for the hacking of the text, which manages to eliminate some of the most famous lines.  This is a lot more bothersome when you actually know the play as it does jar quite a bit to notice omissions.  This is the only thing that really annoyed me, however.
If you think you could enjoy this movie, I would definitely rent it - even if you don't like it, it'll probably be an interesting experience.  Yes, it probably is slightly spoon-fed Shakespeare, but that's no reason to condemn it completely.",1062547200,,1934,4.83939393939394

Danes is an effective Juliet, convincing even, but DiCaprio and Perrineau as Mercutio are by far the best performances in the film. Perrineau portrays Mercutio's manic personality to near perfection. And while DiCaprio is almost too pasionate in his own role, it fits under the circumstances. His melodrama and frenetic behavior are what would be expected when thinking of a boy as young as Romeo was, and as allegedly in love. My favorite scene in this film is shortly after our two central characters ""meet.""

864750,4,630438551X,"`The greatest love story of all time' is what Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo & Juliet has been named as. The story is set in Verona Beach, a city of money and greed. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the perfect Romeo; charming, seductive and persuasive. Juliet played by Claire Danes is sweet, innocent and curious. The pair of star crossed lovers meet by fate eye to eye and create a chemistry of desire. Shakespeare's tale of a love not meant to be is told with passion, energy and a world wide best selling soundtrack.
The soundtrack features throughout the film to provoke different feeling emotions. Kissing You by Des'ree is the love theme song and is played in times when Romeo & Juliet are together to emphasise the love and mystery of seduction is portrayed. I believe Luhrmann chose this style of string harmony music to put you in their emotions and to be inspired to be in love. The hip up-beat music such as Pretty Piece Of Flesh by One Inch Punch creates a contrast to the slow romantic scenes which in turn relax and somewhat hypnotise you. The fast paced scenes emphasised with fast beat  music speed up the heart rate. The Capulet party is one good example where the Montague boys dress up and gate crash the party. Mercutio a dread locked drag queen with a psychotic edge played by Harold Perrineau Jr. offers Romeo a `love drug' which he accepts...
This inspiring tale of two lovers forbidden love who give their lives up in hope to be together in peace without the pressure of the impossibility to be together is tragic and sad; ""For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo...""",1055894400,2,1614,4.56551724137931

Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes did great jobs of playing the star-crossed lovers who ultimately lose their lives for love.
I love this updated version because it allows you to better understand the sometimes difficult language that Shakespeare used in his plays. While the look of the film is very updated, the language is still the same.
I would highly recommend this film to people who are unsure about Shakespeare because they think it's too hard to understand.

I went back to this film, hoping somehow I could shed some light on why everyone thought this was an amazing film. From all the studying I have done, I have come to appreciate some of the artistic choices Luhrmann has made in the film. However, that does not forgive the horrendous acting of every single performer in the movie. They speed right through their lines as if they want to fight the fact that is is written mostly in verse, instead of using it to drive the lines. To truly see how Shakespeare is done, watch the Zeffirelli version. There lies true Shakespearean acting.

The movie has its moments, but for a movie, it is pretty unevenly paced. Shakespeare intended it to be a play, not a movie! In some parts it goes way too slow, while in others it goes way, WAY too fast. And at the beginning the Montague servants are literally screaming their lines, which gets to be like fingernails on a chalkboard after you've been listening to them for several minutes.
Oh yeah, and the Shakespearean language does not fit at all, especially when Romeo and Benvolio are having the conversation at the pool table. Can you imagine to guys walking into an arcade where you are hanging out and talking up a storm of ""thous"" and ""thys"" and ""thees"" while playing pool? Frankly, they looked like performance artists (reenacting a Shakespearean conversation between Romeo and Benvolio while playing pool at a modern arcade... I should try that some day!).

I watched this movie, along with the first version, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey as (of course) Romeo and Juliet, in English. Yes, I know, it was assigned, so I couldn't get out of it. I have to say, both versions are better in different ways. I undoubtedly think that the acting was far better in the first version. I liked the actual movie and the 90's twist better in this version.
I have to say, I am a fan of Baz Lurhmann's work. He did an awesome job directing ""Moulin Rouge"" and some parts in Romeo + Juliet sort of reminded me of that movie. I didn't think that the people could act, though, in this version. Leonardo Di Caprio was horible, and Claire Danes was just ""so-so"".
I don't think they should've used the original Shakespearian lingo, because the actors (and actresses) just couldn't interpret it well enough to act it out. I think that Olivia Hussey was better looking than Claire Danes, but maybe it's just me. I liked the puns in this version, ex: the guns wth ""dagger"" on the side. It was hilarious with Mercutio being a cross-dresser.
I liked this because it was sort of fast paced, which I liked, just like ""Moulin Rouge."" Again, the acting was horrible, our class couldn't stop laughing because they sounded funny trying to say the lines. I'm not sure about the DVD features, so I can't rate them, but the movie is pretty good!

There's a lot of interesting thoughts, how they make the chorus (as done by the newswoman), the prince/chief of police, and mercutio black.  And how can you REALLY criticize leonardo as romeo?  He IS Romeo.  The end isn't bloody enough.  Paris needs to get killed by Romeo, especially as he comes off like such the cornball that he is. But he just disappears instead. Paul Sorvino as Capulet was good.  The Father was very good.  Juliet? My favorite scene that they leave out is her imagining having to pluck and play with her kinsmen's bones and whatnot in case she awakes early in the tomb.  Having Juliet wake up right before Romeo dies is very over-dramatic and so perfect as the play is over-dramatic.
  gunplay in place of sword play just doesn't really work somehow.  John Leguizamo's Tybalt is alright, not his best role, not the best tybalt.  But he has the right look.

This would be a really cool, artsy film. However, Lhurmann tries too hard to be prolific, when he doesn't realize that the story itself is prolific enough.
For those of you who already know the play: The Capulets are decked out in leather and spurs, while the Montagues wear hawaiian shirts, that, for the most part, stay unbuttoned throughout the film. That's one bit of advice I might add: Keep your shirts on. Also, the opening sequences, indeed, everything till about the balcony scene, is cluttered, crazy, and hard to follow, unless you already know the sequence of events pretty well. Once everything calms down, you can really enjoy the symbolism of the film.
Also: A few characterization problems: In the play, Benvolio is more of a peacemaker. That seems to be forgotten in this film. Also, making Mercutio into a drag queen was just too much. It means nothing to the actual development of the plot, it's just there for...I'm trying to decide between entertainment and further confusion, so I don't really have an answer to that right now.

The movie itself would not be good if you are looking for an accurate replay with swords and daggers and extravagant dresses, but I personally think it rises above the other versions because anyone nowadays can relate to it. It's set in our time, and it makes the whole story easier (for me) to follow along with. The men don't fight with swords, they fight with guns (models that are cleverly named Sword 9mm), and the characters don't wear what they would have in the original setting, but clothes that we might wear.

And had he been born in our time, he would have either been a grand master flash DJ or a rhyming Tom Clancy with heavy-duty familial, existential, societal, religious overtones.
Luhrmann so GETS what Shakespeare was doing at a youthful, cocky 30-31 years of age, it's stunning. This is the most fun version of Romeo and Juliet I've ever seen, and sure, the die-hard Shakespearianites (the same cats whose PhD salaries get their kids into private schools and Macy's clothes) will say it doesn't treat Romeo and Juliet with enough reverence.
Hogwash! Romeo and Juliet IS a sentimental play and it's my opinion that someone who can film the play with a realized sense of irony probably has as much (if not more) reverence and understanding of the film as any cat teaching at a state-level university.

Or would he prefer for the legacy of his great works to be continued by an update that fantastically and cleverly brings everything to our own times?
The whole genius of this film is that the lines ARE kept intact, that this is still THE original, and yet we are still allowed to believe that this is modern. The lines are spoken as if this were how people talk to each other these days, and the clever touches such as the 'sword' guns that allow the script to be kept intact are what makes this movie such a delight.
Shakespeare was a pioneer in his time, and so it is only fit to give his plays a pioneering makeover. Shakespeare's scripts are deliberately left open to interpretation in that there are few stage directions, just the lines, and this is how he would have wanted it to be. This defies every expectation, challenged you to think about what the essence of Shakespeare is? Romeo and Juliet is always called timeless.

Therefore it was with difficulty that I could believe my ears and eyes which said this was an absolutely seamless juxtaposition of Shakespearian eloquence and modern street behavior, and an eloquent reminder to all of us about the eternal essence of adolescent life and its genuine tragedies. Romeo and Juliet is a story that demonstrates how Adolescence is a highly complicated and creative time of life on its own merits, and that it needs no new mysterious quality to explain its inherent mystery and the depth of the feelings of its current tenants.
This production was an education for me, and in one two-hour or so block of time, demonstrated as eloquently as I have ever heard it expressed our ultimate sameness through time and geographic location, and despite social or ethnic background.

Umm folks Shakespeare was not considered the greatest writer of his time, he was in many ways the George Lucas of the Elizabethan era. His writing was for the enjoyment of the rich and the poor and it was not to be taken as seriously as so many take it today!
So stop acting as if he was this great icon of his time, he was an actor who started writing and I truly believe he would appreciate Baz's version of his play. The way Baz takes the play out of it's classical scene and places it in the modern day and still keeps the beauty of the story intact is simply thrilling.
The way the two houses are protrayed as modern day mafia-like gangs with their rumbles and fights and the pistols given the names of the classical swords that would be used in a more period version was very smart and inventive.
Claire Danes is a stunning Juliet and Leo does an excellent job as Romeo. No I'm not a Leo fan but I think he gets to bad a rap simply because he was such a fad for awhile there. John Leguizamo is a marvelously slimy Tibalt. The actor play Mercutio has a particularly intersting roll and the way Baz twists the end of the play ever so slightly makes this almost a whole new piece.

Even though I must applaud  Luhrmann's attempt at bringing this Shakespeare play into modern times, he failed horribly.  Why did there have to be a beach?...  The real Verona is landlocked!...  Also, calling the guns ""Sabers"" was a pathetic attempt at modernization.

On the contrary, one could argue that it captured the true essence of the Bard -- pop art. In his day, Shakespeare's plays were edgy and they catered to the populace in general, much as today's action and teen flicks do. Which is why it was so thrilling to see new life breathed into the Romeo and Juliet story and the play made relevant to today's young people. All the original elements were kept intact, although lines were inexplicably cut here and there. Claire Danes did a bang-up job, and unlike every other actress I've seen in the role, totally nailed the ""nor any other part"" innuendo, demonstrating not only her chops as an actress but her understanding of the sometimes-muddy Elizabethan dialogue. DiCaprio's very Shakespeare-in-the-Park-esque Romeo was rather disappointing. Until I watched this film, I thought him a good actor, but he seemed to stumble over the lines, especially next to Danes. Luhrmann did a great job with all the visual gags (loved the names on the guns!), and the cinematography was even more of a head-trip-a-delic roller-coaster ride than I expected. Of course, if one doesn't like Luhrmann's style, one can always watch the uninspired and obsequious Zeferelli version, which this writer suspects Shakespeare would have found incredibly self-important and boring.",1021939200,2,1396,5.12719298245614

Baz Luhrmann has impressed me with two of his films, Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. These are both original films in terms of ideas and style. I like this film because it's like I know the whole thing, but I'm seeing it for the first time. All the acting is great, the look of the film is interesting and deep, and the whole project was thrown together very impressively by Mr. Luhrmann and his crew. All together a very spiffy job and a truly origianl and compelling movie. I would recommend seeing it even if u hate Shakespeare.",1020643200,,634,4.38135593220339
865150,4,630438551X,"I guess I was just being a typical guy when I came up with the title for the review.  Ok, back to business.  I thought the film was unique.  The story of the tragedy (that's what the original play is) is presented to the audience as a news report about two star-crossed lovers that took their own lives in Verona (Verona Beach, that is).
I read Romeo and Juliet in high school (a long time ago).  (It was about time I refreshed my memory.)  This movie has all the essential plot elements of the play.  (How Romeo meets and falls in love with Juliet.  How they elope.  How Mercutio's death spurs Romeo into action by taking Tybalt's life.  How Romeo is exiled.  How Juliet is forced to marry Paris.  How the priest conceives of a plan to bring Romeo and Juliet together.  How that plan fails and they end up dying side-by-side.)
It's made to look ""cool"", sorta like an MTV video.  Each scene is brightly lit and colorful.  Instead of daggers and swords, everyone carries a gun.  (I mean everyone.  They even have to check their guns at the door at various places.)  All the characters seem to have been given a 20th century equivalent role to play.  The apothecary is now a drug dealer.  The priest, well, he's still a priest.  The narrator is at times the news reporter and at times the police chief.  The Montagues and Capulets are big time businessmen.
To tell you the truth, most of the dialogue is spoken so fast that I didn't catch much of what they said.  DiCaprio and Danes play their parts well.  They even looked downright giddy when they first meet.  As for Romeo and Tybalt's gang, they were annoying.  I also couldn't get over the fact that Mercutio was in fact not played by Chris Rock!  It's some guy called Harol Perineau.  In one scene he dressed in drag and started singing.  I got a little weirded out.
All in all, it was a refreshing retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story.  I would recommend picking up a CliffNotes for those who've never read the play.  Knowing the full story and the important lines beforehand will increase your enjoyment of the film.

The old world gentility of Zeffirelli's vision has been brutally stripped away here, leaving a film that blazes with potent imagery and throbs with the violence of adolescent passion. I found the translation deeply unsettling at first, but once I relaxed and allowed myself to admire the filmmakers' inventiveness, I realized that this version was both stunningly creative and, in its way, quite true to Shakespeare's tragic tale of star-crossed teenage love.",1017187200,6,603,5.22680412371134
865152,5,630438551X,"This review is STRICTLY for the SPECIAL EDITION DVD of the film. To me it's already a given as to what a masterpiece Baz Luhrmann has put to the screen.
The special edition gives you all the treats you need.  I'm not talking about still pages of text to read!  I'm talking RAW footage of DiCaprio & Danes practicing their lines, many, many production scenes that leave your mouth open like, ""oh, my gosh, I had no idea they had to go through all of that trouble just to shoot that brief scene""-kind of stuff, and best of all, an early treatment (pitch) for the film that was shot in Australia w/ DiCaprio in some alley ways.  Rather lengthy, not just a mini-clip, Amazing!  Insightful interviews of Baz Luhrmann; why do Shakespeare, how difficult it was to sell the idea to Hollywood, why he made the movie in the style that it is, etc.).  If you have the original DVD & are debating, go for it!
The only disappointing thing was the production value of Claire Danes' interview... DiCaprio's interview is well produced & lit on a candle-filled set, then Claire Danes is terribly keyed (matted) over a few still images (her hair buzzing & breaking through the digital distortion). The menus are nicely done, not animated over-kill. This is an anamorphic for those who have the 16:9 TVs.
I haven't even listened to much of the commentary yet, but it sounds very informative & interesting so far.  Perhaps the most important thing for those who did not like the film or were unsure, is Luhrmann's explanation of why Shakespeare should have been handled the film the way he did (the intense, in-your-face MTV-like editing / modern settings, etc)... truly both men are very visionary & talented.",1017100800,79,1689,4.67003367003367

In the past few years I have been stunned by the fantastic work being done by our top filmmaking talent using Shakespeare's underlying work.  Put Luhrmann in with that group with his version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" which is set in a turbulent, modern, violent world saturated by media influences.

He doesn't deviate from the actual text of the play itself so the star crossed lovers' tale of a couple kept apart by their feuding families remains true to its core.  DiCaprio and Danes perform superbly.  Until ""Titanic,"" DiCaprio was not that well known and many of us were able to enjoy him in the edgier, chancier acting roles he took, like this one.  Personally, I prefer these new, modern film versions of the plays to the same plays performed traditionally on the stage and I have seen them that way.

The director, Baz Luhrman, was able to capture the spirit of the story while setting it in present day California.  The way they portrayed the narrator was perfect.  It was incredible how Baz was able to add even more drama, and at the same time comedy, to this wonderful Shakespearean tale.

865207,4,630438551X,"It would be a lot easier to understand if you read the play in it's original text first.
The Bad-There are times when the actors seem to have troubles with their lines. Which, is understandable because the scene is modern day Verona with Shakesperean launguage. The Capulet Boys were odd (Tybalt and crew). They were mexican or something...I have nothing against mexicans, but why were they in Verona? I honestly didn't see too many horrible faults in this movie though.
The Good-Where do I start? The swords updated to guns was a nice touch (example-Rapier 8mm). The ending was a little different from the book. Generally, it was the same, there was only a slight difference. But I liked this ending a lot more. Leonardo DiCaprio was spectacular throughout the film. Mercuitio was also amazing. But the one change I thought was both bizarre and cool, was when Romeo took the ecstacy from Mercuitio and semi-freaked ar the Capulet party.
The Ugly-The Capulet boys clothes. What the hell was that?

865208,5,630438551X,"Part of the greatness of Shakespeare's plays is that they require interpretation - the actors and directors are free to portray the characters however they are inspired to. I immensely enjoy most interpretations of Shakespeare, simply because there's so much room to play with. Baz Lurhman chose to set his ""Romeo & Juliet"" in modern times, with a modern soundtrack, but retaining Shakespeare's ""original"" dialogue.
I put quotes around ""original"" because the lines are seriously edited down and, in some places, hacked to pieces. I may have been more satisfied had They done something like Branagh did with his ""Hamlet;"" use the *whole* script. Ah well, c'est la vie, c'est la guerre.
Luhrman makes up lost ground with the talented use of vivid colors, sweeping tracking shots, and dream-like sequences for which he's famous. Further, CiCaprio didn't make me want to gouge out my own eyes with a melon baller - usually I find him intolerable, but he did a remarkable job with Romeo. The scenes calling for angst, in particular, showcase what talent he possesses, when he wants to access it. Claire Danes does a passable job as Juliet, but I largely found her tiresome. Pete Postlethwaite was a very nice surprise as Father Laurence - it was interesting to see him as a different sort of character. Harold Perrineau was a fantastic Mercutio, bringing a wonderful spirit and energy to the role.
I really recommend this movie, even though it's assuredly not for everyone; in my humblest of opinions, the aesthetics of the movie should please even the most stuffed of the stuffed shirts. Or, falling short of ""pleasing,"" it might just make some thing ""ooo, pretty"" once in awhile. Shakespeare is hardly ever a waste of time, unless the performance is utterly passionless, and this interpretation definitely doesn't lack passion.",1014940800,4,1824,5.023102310231023
865209,4,630438551X,"I write this as someone who has actually seen only the first fifteen minutes or so of this movie about five times and none of the rest. But each time I saw these same scenes I enjoyed them. And the last time I watched it was after I had begun reading the play of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in school and was getting very interested in Shakespeare`s work, and I realized that the movie is a lot easier to understand if you have read the play and you`re familiar with the lines. If not easier, it`s a lot more fun that way because then you can see how the way Luhrman brings it to the screen with such a different setting is very creative and stunning. And the amazing thing is that nothing about the story is changed at all, it`s just the setting. After a while watching this movie you`ll start enjoying the strangeness in a guy throwing his cigarette to the ground and drawing his gun as he says ""Peace? I hate the word as I hate hell, all Montagues and thee.""
I personally am very excited to see the rest of this movie once I am finished reading the play. Though I would have advised it for ""Moulin Rouge,"" I`m not going to say that you should get this movie NOW and watch it the whole way through because I promise you`re going to love it. But I will say that you should definitely try it out and see if you like it, because you might really enjoy it, especially if you are any kind of Shakespeare enthusiast.",1013299200,3,1403,4.2
865210,3,630438551X,"First of all, modernizing Shakespeare is a tricky thing.  Not because I'm in that camp that thinks his works are sacred and should NEVER be trifled with (Okay guys!  Will was great but he was not GOD.  If we can edit the Bible for TV, can't we edit the Bard? Hm?) but because it has to be done in a way that does not distract from the story, and it has to be done in a way so that you can lose yourself in the dialogue even though it does not ""fit"" with the time period.  We'll dispense with the ""bad"" first.
I had several problems with this film.  Many times, the actors are saying their lines and it is *painfully* obvious they have no idea what they are talking about.  They will latch on to one word that they understand and emphasize it, destroying the whole flow of the line, and taking emphasis off the whole point of their dialogue.  There was alot of inflection and screaming of lines that seemed.....odd.  In the middle of scenes, the action suddenly speeds up for no apparent reason like we're watching on fast forward.  This is not only distracting, but pointless.
My second problem:  Claire Danes.  Now don't get me wrong, I like Claire.  I adored ""My So Called Life"", but her Juliet is the most lifeless, bland, and spiritless interpretation I've ever seen.  Juliet is the most passionate female role Shakespeare ever wrote.  She is vivacious, expressive, and madly in love.  Throughout this entire film, I never see any of that from Claire.  She delivers her lines like she's telling Romeo about the weather, and when her cousin is killed by her new husband her expression is the same as it has been through the whole film, like she's contemplating taking a shower or a bath!  When Juliet wakes up and finds her husband dead, she chokes out ONE sob and a not very convincing one at that.
Another problem I had with the casting of Claire is that I just don't feel she was attractive enough to play Juliet, especially paired with Leonardo Dicaprio.  It was a bit unbelievable that his sexy, brooding, Romeo would fall passionately in love with this rather plain, emotionless girl.  Thirdly, could someone please tell me WHY Juliet's mother speaks with a southern accent?!  And why are all of Juliet's family obviously of spanish decent when she, her mother, and her father are not?  It was also a little hard to buy that Romeo was living in a trailer in Mantua.  Did he have a velvet Elvis painting as well?  Hmm....Ah well...on to the good.
The updating swords to guns worked rather smoothly and calling the guns ""Sword 9mm"" etc. was a nice touch.  The balcony scene taking place in the pool was really quite brave and it worked well.  The aquarium when they first meet was very affective and was a cute addition of ""hide and go seek"" as they peek through at each other, eventually culminating in Romeo knocking his face against the glass.  Mercutio being a drag queen was an ingenius idea, and definitely not one I would have ever imagined.  Very clever!
Paul Rudd is adorable as Paris, which is a pleasant surprise considering in most versions, Paris is usually old, ugly, and almost always has a nose of a very unusual shape (I don't know why this is but it seems to be a pattern).  The costumes at the party were very cute.  Romeo as a knight and Juliet as an angel.  Not very original, but cute just the same.  The love scene before Romeo leaves for his exile is sexy but tastefully done.
Leonardo Dicaprio plays Romeo as a misunderstood James Dean-esque rebel with a mysterious aura about him.  Even by the end of the film, it feels we don't truly know all there is to know about Romeo.  This brings a freshness to the character and gives him some more depth, (although Dicaprio *should* have spent more time learning to understand his lines.  He is just as guilty of overemphasizing incorrect words as the others are).  The ending of the film is done lavishly which adds to the inevitable climax.  Dicaprio does a good job of conveying his pain and loss over the ""death"" of his wife.
The ending of this film is a bit different from others in that it has gleaned much from the story of R&J which Shakespeare based his play on rather than the play itself.  This adds an even more tragic somberness to the ending (as if it needed it!) which is an unexpected, yet effective addition.  The music chosen and scored for this film is all quite good.  The use of Radiohead's ""Talk Show Host"" as Romeo's theme music fits Dicaprio's moody version of the character to a tee.  The piano muscled ""Kissing You"" is a lovely song and fits well as the background to the aquarium scene.
All of that said, this film is worth watching, especially if you enjoy Shakespeare.  It has many things that work, and many things that do not, but it is still enjoyable.  However, if you wish to see a more passionate and conventional version of Romeo and Juliet, I still recommend the 1969 Zeffirelli version with Leonard Whiting and the incomparable Olivia Hussey.  For me, it sets the standard to which all versions of Romeo and Juliet will be compared.",1013299200,10,5045,4.52817679558011
865211,4,630438551X,"I suspect Shakespeare would be pleased with Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of his work.  The 1968 version of Romeo & Juliet was-- like this-- quite different from that which proceeded it.  (Before Franco Zeffirelli's film, Romeo and Juliet were always played by adults.)
I am mildly embarassed to confess that when I saw Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet in the theaters, I was profoundly confused.  Aside from reading the Cliff Notes about the play and watching the Zeffirelli film (of course, with the brief nudity redacted)in high school too-many years prior, I honestly did not know the tale.  Having matured intellectually and in the comfort of my home, I gave the DVD a try-- since Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Roughe both pleased me, I assumed I just missed something.  And I was right.  This is extremely loyal to the feel, the fun, the drama, and the tension of Shakespeare.
Since I am making my true confessions, here is another: I watched it again... with subtitles.  I missed a lot because of the clever manner in which the dialouge is arranged, which, naturally, is foriegn to my ear.
There are only two criticisms I have.  Even though this film has a largely camp feel, Leonardo DiCaprio somehow manages to overract many of his lines.  Indeed, there are two points at which I cringe as Leonardo annuciates exactly the incorrect words; yet reveals an I-am-so-smart gleem in his eye.  The second is merely of the DVD.  It teases you with ""Special Features,"" only to discover that the only feature is the trailer.  This is disappointing.  Features, being plural, certainly made me expect something more.  Probably more relevant was my recent purchase of the Moulin Rouge DVD, which was so jam-packed with extras that I have spent hours wading through them and am not finished.  Something more here would have been nice.",1013212800,,1821,4.866883116883117

All my hesitation disappeared.  It may have had something to do with John Leguizamo's performance (always a good choice, in my opinion), it may have had something to do with the brilliant soundtrack, or maybe the costuming, or maybe the sets.  More probably it is the way the whole is joined together in a way the sets off the original voice of Shakespeare, highlighting the violence and the passion, the poetry and the drama in a way that makes it sing and live.

I especially like the opening scene:  Shakespeare often opened with a clown to make the audience pay attention--the director here opens with a punk rock clown-hair colored thug.  Nice in-joke.
I take a star away because, although I don't mind EDITING Shakespeare, I have some problems that the lines were put in the wrong order.

 FIRST: as a remake of romeo and juliet. as a fanatic of romeo and juliet, and especially the 1968 zefirelli version, i absolutely hated this movie. the scenes were twisted, cut, changed and defiled until it was almost unrecognizable. favorite characters were dropped (such as the nurse who was such an important and lovable character, while in this version she is a one dimensional character who cannot speak english) or altered in horrible ways. (never have i ever pictured mercutio as a black drag queen) the roles were horrifically miscast for the difficult dialogue. this is most apparent in the first scene where a fight breaks out at a gas station. it's like watching people speaking a foreign language that they have been taught to say phonetically but have no idea what the words mean. they try their pathetic little hearts out but the end result is cringe-worthy. as a final opinion: i will never ever forgive baz luhrmann for [...messing] with the balcony scene. not ever.

 SECOND: as a movie of its own. visually spectacular and nothing short of what we've come to expect of baz luhrmann and his fanciful eye for the exotic, the beautiful, the ethereal. let me put it to you this way: even cosidering the above opinions i will still buy this movie and try not cringe-- just so i can see the incredible images he creates. the soundtrack is decent and the acting is mostly passable, the best in the bunch being claire danes as juliet. i may be biased, however, by my firm belief that leonardo dicraprio should never be cast in any role with the possible exception of the portrayal of a buttrock. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of the great american buttrock, i will attempt to explain. in school plays, when you have too many actors and not enough parts, someone will have to provide scenery by getting down on all fours, with their butt in the air, and have a sheet put over them so that they may be mistaken for a rock. voila, la buttrock.",1009929600,2,2070,4.6016260162601625

865282,5,630438551X,"Audacious, sexy, thrilling and beautiful, this film takes Shakespeare's classic and spills it into the wonderfully ribald world of Verona Beach, Miami. The Montagues and the Capulets are at war, and Romeo and Juliet are caught in the crossfire. They love each other, but can't be together because of the circumstances. It's tragedy at it's best, and this film does nothing to detract from that.
Some may scoff at the fast pace, but no one can deny the affecting performances given by Leonardo DiCaprio (incredible as Romeo- he gives the role dark emotional weight, while keeping the inner core of boyishness, humour and sexiness), Claire Danes, who is meltingly lovely as Juliet- and witty as well, which is refreshing. Pete Postelwaite is dryly fantastic as the Priest and Harold Perrineau gives the role of Mercutio all he has and more.
Verona Beach, with all it's souped up cars, guns and Hawaiian shirts, is a world that Shakespeare himself could never have envisioned, but I believe, wouldn't have him spinning in his grave. He lived to entertain -- Mercutio as a cross-dresser and Romeo popping acid aren't as far from Shakespeare's vision as some might think.
I reccommend this film to anyone who wants a thrill ride through love, death, tears, vengeance- and a foray into the tortured world of Romeo and Juliet's love, which touched everyone they knew, in one way or another.",1009238400,,1383,4.939914163090129

Each one of these running and jumping characters is freeze framed and kindly introduced to us with big white letters.  Naturally, the gas station explodes.  Even the combat scenes in this movie are boring and I would favor the sword fighting in Zeffirelli's classic any day.
The cinematography is overstylized and self absorbed.  Much of the film is shot in dead sepia tones; watching it is like drowning in stale beer.  There are also many garish light effects and glib camera tricks that make it look like a trashy music video.  Bring out the disco ball!
The acting is unforgivable.  Leonardo DiCaprio speaks Shakesperian blandly, as though he were ordering pizza.  When his performance isn't lacking in passion, he overdramatizes.  When he shoots Tybalt, he screams for about a minute.  When he comes to the line ""I defy you stars"" he screams for about a minute.
Clare Danes is like a sexy trick-or-treater in her little angel outfit as she, like DiCaprio fumbles through the script.
Perhaps most lamentably, clever Mercutio is somehow transformed into a mindless transvestite that shouts a lot.
This most recent version of Romeo and Juliet falls only scarcely short of a deliberate attempt to defame a great work of literature.  Unfortunately, it has been a popular movie because of Dane's and DiCaprio's teen icon status.  This production of Romeo and Juliet has become a fetish of pop culture and it is as thoughtless as a Friday night drinking binge.  The only worse film I can think of is Street Fighter the Movie.

865401,4,630438551X,"The widespread criticism of this film is a bit puzzling to me, as any film that makes the timelessness of Shakespeare not only palpable, but beloved by the MTV generation as a cult video hit should be appreciated and, hell, lauded for such a feat.
And this play, above all others, to my mind, *needs* to be kept alive for teens to enjoy, as it's a breathtaking story of the purest love driven to tragedy by foolishness and impatience. It's the perfect catharsis for the broken-hearted, and the perfect date movie.
Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer for the masses, not an obtuse artist whose work was only meant to be appreciated by a select few. (I know there are plenty who'll argue that point vehemently with me --- bring it on.)
DiCaprio gives us a great slacker in Romeo, who shows (to borrow from another play) ""only the suits and trappings of woe"" when we first see him writing love poetry to an unrequited love at the beginning of the film, and he flares to life wonderfully after meeting Juliet. Danes does a great job playing Juliet as a young woman, who is mature but so deeply in love that she ignores her better judgment, rather than going the easier ""ditzy girl"" route with the character. Nearly every actor in the film does a top-notch job at contemporizing their characters.
As for the film itself, much has been made of the colourful art direction and the music-video editing, but it is really only truly radical on the surface. When compared to another recent contemporisation of Shakespeare, Michael Almerayda's Hamlet, Luhrmann's take on Romeo and Juliet truly is quite conservative in preserving the play's meanings beneath the flashy surface.
My only qualms with the film? At times, the soundtrack truly hurts the film, adding nearly nothing and actually hurting the mood. Poppy songs like The Cardigans' ""Lovefool"" are shoe-horned in just for a moment or two, for the sake of saying they were in the movie. On the other hand, Des'ree's gorgeous song ""Kissing You"" is perfect for the title lovers' first meeting, and Radiohead's two additions, ""Talk Show Host"" and ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" work wonders for the mood.
The opening scene of violence, obviously paying homage to Hong Kong action cinema is done with far too much over-the-top campiness. The opening scene should to be so memorable  that the intense violence echoes throughout the rest of the play, adding proof that the lovers' families are truly the most bitter of enemies. As it is, not only is the scene quite easily forgotten, but the tone is completely out-of-sync with the rest of the film. Luhrmann shows us that he can quite capably handle scenes of memorable violence later in the film during Mercutio's death scene, though.
The constant bombardment of Christian imagery grows a bit weary and obvious at times (even showing up in the film's ""R+J"" title) but Luhrmann's message that the purity of love is sacred and even holy is well-intentioned and rings true.
Thanks to great performances and energetic direction, though, these flaws don't come close to spoiling a fresh and exhilariting update on one of the greatest works of drama in history, one which will be beloved of me and my peers for years to come.

DiCaprio is terrible.  This is perhaps his worst performance up to this film; however, Luhrmann did well in casting him in this film, because he, like Danes, works well as naive, star-crossed lovers.  It's just that he's not made for Shakespearean lines.
There are certainly some high points to the movie.  Clair Danes actually performs fairly well, and she's cute as a button (which is how one should envision the 14-year old Juliet).  John Leguizamo certainly becomes an ominous character of danger playing Tybalt's role.

865407,5,630438551X,"There will be people out there that will criticize this version of Romeo + Juliet.  Sadly, these people think they are purists, but are totally mistaken.  As one that's been reading Shakespeare for years, and have taken classes specifically about the great Bard, as well as being an avid playgoer, this is simply put, one of the most exquisite versions of this tragedy on film.  Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet was not made to be a sedate and quiet drama, it was written about a time and place that was quite racy by Elizabethan England's standards.  Verona was a place of blood, lust, and intrigue.  By updating the storyline so dramatically, Luhrmann tries to give the modern audience a taste of what made this play so remarkable in its time.  At first it might seem brash and too MTVish, and simple-minded viewers may be immediately turned off by it, but for those who love seeing Shakespeare come alive, they will be delighted.
In our modern times it's often hard to look back on a play like Romeo + Juliet and understand how a sword fight can turn a town upside down or how a feud between two families can get a whole community involved, but Luhrmann turns everything up a notch and makes it obvious why these events were so important to the story's progression.  Lurhmann is masterful at updating a classic story to the modern day while preserving the beauty of the original text, and revealing the raw emotion and fire in every scene.  The art direction, costuming and sets are excellent and created a fantasy world that the viewer can get swept up and lost in.  A great preformance by DiCaprio and the rest of the cast allow this movie to shine to it's fullest potential.  There are few people that watch this movie and have mixed views - you will either love it or hate it.

If you hate it, you obviously just don't understand.",989193600,20,1965,4.582857142857143
865438,2,630438551X,"""Parting is such sweet sorrow, so I say goodnight until morrow.""
Why not just goodbye? That's what I said after my first and last viewing of Baz Luhrmann's rendition of ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" a film I anticipated eagerly, which would explain my dislike for it. The movie takes an unconventional approach to the famed work, pitting the tale of our lovers amidst a modern-day setting, while keeping the precise words from the original play. It attempts to appeal to a broad range of audiences, which explains most of this things wrong with it.
Our introduction to the film begins with an ugly outburst between members of two opposing families, the Capulets and the Montagues, at a gas station in Verona Beach, Miami. We're given brief introductions to the important characters, centering on the ominous Tybalt, who slings guns and matches but never inspires any sense of boldness or fear. As the story goes, we're introduced to our ""star-crossed lovers,"" Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet. Their relationship is immediate and rushed, amidst the brawling of their opposing families, and their ultimate decision to stay together seals their timely fates.
The big question weighing on everyone's mind is, ""Why doesn't it work?"" There are three answers to this question: 1) the incorporation of the play's dialogue and events into modern-day life, 2) the way in which the treatment is handled by Luhrmann, and 3) a lack of emotion generated by the supporting cast.
The film attempts to keep the dialogue and customs of the period within the story, and it clashes with the modern-day era in so many ludicrous ways. Romeo's friends and confidants wear saggy pants and unbuttoned shirts, all the while shouting out poetry in an almost rap-like nature. Their lines are unconvincing and border on hilarity in some serious scenes, taking away from the story of anguish and battle between the families.
Of course, some blame is to lay at the hands of the actors in these roles. John Leguizamo portrays Tybalt, and fails to do anything with the character. He is supposed to be feared by his foes, and cocky in his demeanor, but Leguizamo only succeeds in making a mere fool of himself by hamming it up all the way. Dash Mihok is seriously miscast as Benvolio, and would do better to stay away from serious roles such as this. And the hammiest of the hammy goes to Carlos Martn Manzo Otlora who, as Petruchio, is uninspiring, unconvincing, and just plain aggravating to watch. His trysts in drag are some of the most ridiculous machinations of the film.
The battle between the two families is never established, nor are the actors who portray the parents of our lovers. Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague is given nothing more to do than sit in a limo throughout most of the film debating with his wife, an equally uninvolving Christina Pickles. Lady Capulet, now Gloria, played by Diane Venora, is overly flamboyant and flat, and her performance at a costume party is the glaze on the ham. The one supporting character who is given a chance to shine is Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, and when he lays the hand down on Juliet, his performance is powerful in spite of the rest.
And then there are the two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet. There is an large amount of chemistry between these two, which is intrical to the romance, and and the two of them play their parts extremely well. DiCaprio is actually convincing in his deliverance of Shakespeare's poetic words, as is Danes, who evokes sadness and a slight naivety in her role. The love scenes, most notably at the costume party and at the balcony, sold me on their romance and chemistry and, believe it or not, I felt my heart beating a little faster. It's only a shame that all of this is wasted on the surrounding execution of the plot.
Luhrmann's use of the story's plot amidst modern Miami is a far miss in terms of believability. Our opposing characters carry around guns like a baby carries candy, in full view of citizens and cops; Romeo is merely banished from the city for his ole in the death of Tybalt; everyone is speaking in verse and rhyme. You'll find yourself heaving a lot of ""no ways"" throughout. His combination of the verse of the play and modern times seem more like hopes of attaining a larger audience than actual art or vision.
There's too much hammy acting and uninspiring elements in ""Romeo and Juliet"" to merit acclaim of any sort. The only upside resides in the romance aspect between the two young lovers, handled wonderfully by the two leads. But Luhrmann chooses to bury them under a blanket of ludicrous performances by most of the supporting cast and muddled dialogue which is totally out of place in the modern setting.

Director Baz Luhrmann's vision for Romeo & Juliet is visually exciting.  The sets, costumes, locations, and props down to the smallest detail are rich and vivid.  The soundtrack is riotous and is the perfect accompaniment to the neo-catholic design of the movie.  With snippets of Wagnerian opera, and some great techno, the soundtrack proved to be audio bliss, and this movie had a great deal of impact on me when I saw it in the theatre.
There are some details of this movie that just make the whole thing worthwhile: the clannish costuming of the two families (ultracool hawaiian for the Montagues, and latino-gothic for the Capulets), the revamping of two pop songs in the style of a catholic boys' choir (most notably, Prince's ""When the Doves Cry"" in an amazing performance by Quindon Tarver), the lush locations in Mexico City and the Catholic themes that show up all through the movie.  It is truly a beautiful film.
Although this movie is mostly aimed at the MTV generation (and therefore probably exempt from my complaints, because its audience doesn't care about them), it falls short in some fundamental areas.  ""Romeo and Juliet"" does not achieve the clarity that ""good"" Shakespeare movies such as those adapted and directed by Kenneth Branaugh (""Much Ado About Nothing"" ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"") do:  namely, the delivery of the lines.  Almost all the actors, with the exception of Pete Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence), and Christina Pickles, with her short performance as Mrs. Montague, delivered lines so badly that it was hard to tell what they were talking about.  (This is where the strong visuals come in, as the audience could always SEE what was happening, if the dialog did not make it clear).  Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad actors, just not good Shakesperean actors.
That being said, the casting was good (at least appearance-wise), and most of the choices made in production worked to make this movie a glorious two-hour music video that just might tempt some non-believers into appreciating Shakespeare.",981244800,5,2286,4.994736842105263

In fact, all of the actors in this show get a bit baffled if their sentence happens to last more than about a line and a half; they seem unable to insert a parenthetical phrase and still make the two surrounding pieces of the sentence sound like parts of the same sentence. But of course, doing words is not what this particular spectacle is about. It's about quick-cut editing for the ADD generation. The rap/rock music gives way at the end to Isolde's Transfiguration - to be recognized by whom in its target audience, I wonder?

The prologue for instance is given three times : on TV by an anchorwoman, over real life pictures by a male overvoice emphasized by headlines in papers, and finally in text injections on black screens at high speed. The situation is changed and the brawl is transformed into a gang war betwwen two rich boys' gangs, the Montagues being some kind of punks and the Capulets some kind of Latin America mafia, with a strong set of allusions to western films, and even to Clint Eastwood's  a Man named Nobody . Tybalt is the direct impersonification of evil with his metal teeth printed with SIN, with his image of Christ on his waistcoat that he flashes at Benvolio as an image of the death that is awaiting Benvolio, as if this picture were a mirror image of Benvolio in the process of dying. The main change though is the transformation of the Prince into the head of the police that comes from the sky in a helicopter and that has full power to keep the peace in Verona's streets. It is a vision of a society where the police is omnipresent and where the youth can only organise their pleasures and entertainments in a rebelious search for street adventure. It is in a way marvelous. Di Caprio is admirable as a romantic, naive and completely lost young man or old teenager. Mercutio is a prodigy as a black man and a drag queen, even if only for fun. He is a pretty jolly good fellow even if a grave man in a many ways. One excellent adaptation. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",975628800,,1758,4.459627329192546
865732,5,630438551X,"i don't understand how some people dislike this movie so much.  i love shakespeare and consider myself somewhat of a scholar of his works.  i'm all for retaining the purity of his poetry and works.  but his ACTUAL works and not the traditional interpretation of his works.  anyone who knows shakespeare should realize that the traditional ""men in tights, and formal english accents"" version of his works are just as much interpretations as this film.  None of them are representative of his original production for one simple reason.  his productions never stayed the same.  nothing was set in stone.  each performance of every play would vary depending on the audience.  mostly performed in open air theatres,  he had to compete with the stench of the streets, the shouts of people selling thier wares, the ever present noisy drunks...he was the MASTER of improv.  even the written version of the play was never one complete manuscript.  it was put together by people from different bits and pieces, from different productions, and different versions.  many of these were never written by shakespeare's hand, but by people paid to write down the lines as they were spoken during the production.  the only way that you can look critically at any interpretation of shakespeare, is to look at the intent of the play and the corresponding intent of the interpretation.  this movie's intent is very much the same as shakespeare's, from all evidence.  verona beach is exotic, violent, sexy and religious, just like Verona, Italy was considered to be by londoners in his time.
Shakespeare's main intent of the play was to relay a story... a beautiful story, to any and all of the people in his audience, from beggars to lords.  and he did it however he could.  every traditional version of the play i've ever seen tried to formalize shakespeare.  he wasn't formal, he was a commoner with a great talent.  other plays have cleaned up, edited out, or lightly brushed past the innuendo and the entendres he included in his work. unless you were lucky enought to under stand the meaning behind the words, you were left out on the joke.  no one ever tried to help you out visually, to help bring meaning to the words. Baz Luhrmann did.  he went to the same extremes as shakespeare would have to reach an audience.  he  brought out the ludicrous, the perverted, and the hilarious meanings in shakespeare's words.  Baz was reaching for one audience, one which has been completely left out of the loop as far as shakespeare's works are concerned.  If you prefer the traditional INTERPRETATION of Romeo and Juliet than by all means go ahead, but I think you would do good to watch this movie with an open mind.",975369600,8,2695,4.79175704989154

The settings for this movie were terrible.  The mansions were  trying to look like castles and modern houses all at the same time.  Again,  this didn't work.
I also think Dicaprio was miscast.  He seemed too  inexperienced to play the role of Romeo.  His lines sounded forced, and his  emotions were often overacted.

In ROMEO & JULIET's case, the cocktail isn't so  digestible. The emotion that lies in the Shakespearian text is annihilated  by the hysteric editing and the Broadway-like gesticulation of the young  cast. So throw away your handkerchiefs and be ready for a so-so parody of  one of the most beautiful text of english literature. In this peculiar  example, images have killed the words.
If you really want to discover how  to adapt with success the old William nowadays, take a look at director  Abel Ferrara's CHINA GIRL, you won't regret it.

Unfortunately, the movie turns into a silly music video that makes so little sense that everyone I know- child, teen, or adult- who saw this movie hated it.  The visuals are terrible, always zooming in uncomfortably on everyone's face; everyone overacts, belting out old English without appearing to have any more clue as to what they're saying than the audience.  The only good actor in this film was, in my opinion, Claire Danes, who was excellent as the more down-to-earth Juliet.
I have never personally met anyone who enjoyed this movie; of over 30 people I've talked to about this movie, of all different backgrounds, opinions, and levels of understand on Shakespeare, every  single person didn't like this movie, and most thought it was one of the worst movies they'd ever seen; so do I.

We're used to passive entertainment, but to  appreciate this movie you need to take a day or two and read the play.  The  language does take some getting used to.  Many Shakespeare fans dislike the  rock-video feel of it, but I don't think that's a drawback at all.  Shakespeare wrote for everyone, from the most cultured to the most common,  and his plays have immense value on many different levels.  There is no  golden law that says the plays cannot be taken out of the Elizebethan  setting.  This film has a weird dystopian feel that I really liked.  I  can't say I'm a huge fan of Dicapprio but I don't think he killed the  language - Kermit the Frog couldn't kill Shakespeare's language.

A Beethoven symphony is great work, not because only of the musical themes  and how they are arranged but because of the perfection of the  orchestration.
Now if a cast cannot do justice to Shakespeare's words or  an orchestra cannot do justice to Beethoven's music, we have to consider  the result a failure. I can't see any disagreement so far.
Now if Spike  Jones does a spoof a Beethoven work, we laugh and accept it for what it is:  a humorous attempt that uses Beethoven but does not pretend to BE  Beethoven. It is not quite clear to me exactly what this movie is setting  out to do. Certainly it trying to tell a timeless story set in modern  times. So far, so good. Picture now a junior high school band trying to  play a very difficult work.

Then, of course, there's shakesperes  charm minus its oldness. hey, the movie kept the originals emotions.  shakespere was getting a bit stuffy for this time and age and i guess this  movie kept all its literary value while injecting some fun into it.",944438400,2,958,4.822085889570552
866135,3,630438551X,"Baz Luhrmann's heart was in the right place by making this modernized adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. This film is an inventive way to introduce young people to the beautiful and poignant world of Shakespeare.  Unfortunately I believe that he might have underestimated the attention  span of today's youth by attempting to appeal to them with cartoon like  visual effects and a deafening soundrack. the Bard's poetry and the  relevance of this movie's modern environment should have been sufficient.  Unlike most people I feel that Dicaprio delivered an insightful and moving  performance as the young Romeo. Danes on the other hand was a weak Juliet  and should leave Shakespeare to the pros. John Leguizamo gave us an  intriguing and powerful Tybalt and this film's Mercutio is beyond compare.  Sadly enough, even with these performances acting as a strength for the  film, it's weaknesses and monumental cuts from the text will probably leave  most Shakespeare lovers cold.",944179200,,976,5.1923076923076925

866137,5,630438551X,"First of all, let me say to those who gave this movie just one star, you just hate Shakespeare!!! When Shakespeare wrote this over 400 years ago, he was telling a love story that was meant to be for all generations. The  reason why Romeo was updated is so that the MTV generation could enjoy it  just like me.  This is a must show in English class. If you enjoy this play  (even though it is a movie) like I do, you might want to check out  Shakespeare's other play ""Hamlet"" with Kennth Branagh. It is good  also.",931824000,,513,4.183673469387755

I assumed it would be some hokey Gen X version that I would have no interest in.  Besides, I have no real interest  in Shakespere.  Anyway, it came to cable, and I watched it.  Looks like  I'll have to eat crow.  I was absolutely stunned by its audacious  stylishness.  It was a romp from beginning to end.  Everyone gave superb  performances, except for DiCaprio and Daines, who were merely good enough.  They could have found a sexier woman to play Juliet.  John Leguizamo and  Harold Perrineau Jr. gave especially noteworthy performances.  It was a  real delight to watch these thoroughly modern characters so effortlessly  speak Elizabethan english.  Is this a serious and faithful adaptation of  the play?  Of course not, but who cares?  It's just plain fun.  This is  definitely on my list of cinematic ""guilty pleasures.""",930614400,,938,4.754716981132075
866191,5,630438551X,"Though the text is chopped considerably, after spending time trying to teach a group of high school students about scansion and other aspects of Shakespearen text with very little enthusiastic responses, I have  difficutly criticizing this film which suddenly excited and moved the same  students about the same story.  It is a Romeo and Juliet for the nineties  and it succeeds because it goes all the way in making its choices.  Luhrmann manages to get the point of the play across while making the play  accessible to a modern audience.  For instance, shifting the strong  homosocial bond between Romeo and Mercutio to a homosexual crush of  Mercutio on Romeo brings the film into the 90's using Mercutio's textual  jealousy of Romeo's relationship with Juliet as its substansiation.  Don't  watch it for a definitive R&J, but watch it to understand what this  story means in a modern, not an historical, context.

I never was much of a Shakespeare fan because the languange has  changed so much over the centuries, but this movie took what was basically  a decent play and made it into some sort of twisted West Side story  wannabee.
If you love Shakespeare, you'll probably like this twisted  version.  If you don't really care for the Bard, then avoid this one.",922406400,2,575,4.623762376237623

866229,1,630438551X,"I saw this piece of rip off trash in the theater and wanted to leave after the first 15 minutes.  I decided to rent it since everything else was out and it got worse on the second viewing.  The beginning fight looks like a  parody of West Side Story (another pathetic excuse for the true R & J).  The story plods along at a snails pace and DiCaprio has to be the worst  Romeo in cinematic and theatrical history.  As someone who's played the  role, I noticed he never even came close to capturing the true essence of  Romeo.  A young man torn by true love and a tragic mistake at the hands of  a family feud should be played as such not a bad ripoff of a Bon Jovi  video. DiCaprio walked through the role and seemed to be yelling whenever  any real emotion was needed.  What a no-talent hack!  The only bright spots  in this movie were Friar Laurence and John Legumiziamo.  A real movie would  have been Legumiziamo as Romeo.  Then at least you would have had a real  actor playing this romantic role and someone with some testosterone.  Alas  poor Tybalt!  We hardly knew you!",921628800,6,1077,4.306532663316583
