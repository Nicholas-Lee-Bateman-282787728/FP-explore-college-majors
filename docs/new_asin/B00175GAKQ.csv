3167304,2,B00175GAKQ,"I am on season 5. Even though this series is incredibly flawed. I stop here.
The writers love to add blood and gore and sick sick murderers.
What it lacks: -- Any glue from episode to episode, keeping me interested for the long developing story. Each episode is mostly by itself.
-- Good lines and characters of the staff. Watching this makes me long for the lightweight, comefic Murder in Paradise, in which a white British detective is sent to work on a crime on a Carribbean island and can't get home although he hates sand and all that bright bright sunlight. He longs for his foggy, cold and rainy pub. But his staff of two policemen and a woman assistant detective, all black, are all extremely competent.  Each episode is also wrapped up in each episode but the actors are so good we don't care. A second series is coming up.

The only character who has any good lines in WITB is Tony Hill. The Alex character, replacing 'Carol', is mostly sour and uninteresting. Like Carol, she is mostly a foil for Tony's intuitive brilliance. In the fifth series she is still letting Tony make all the hypotheses about the criminal. As top DC she should be adding ideas by now, and not asking so many naive questions. She is very passive, except when giving authoritarian orders --Carol was the same.

For a detective series in which women actually have a brain and are interesting see the one with two last names (I may get back with the names); the two woman detectives are personalities by themselves and their boss, another woman, is tops, as an actor and a DCI.

In this fifth series of WITB the second episode of four is entirely out of character; it is about voodoo, hyperreligion and is so loud and extreme I stopped watching early and threw it away.

The writing is uneven, from episode to episode, but got better, somewhat, after the third or fourth.

3167312,5,B00175GAKQ,"This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery shows
goes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.

I would recommend this show to anyone tired and bored by the endless stream of mindless trival 'reality' shows to get into this program to challenge their mind and engage the active part of their brain. Cast was well chosen and act as though this is not a program but real crime drama. Not wooden but includes little pieces of their lives away from the crime scene. A must see program.

3167315,4,B00175GAKQ,"""Wire in the Blood, Season 5,"" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial, based on the works of Val McDermid, to reach these shores.  The series, a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill, criminal profiler, is produced by Green's production company for the British Granada TV: he's one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here, which has been spun off as a standalone.

In addition to Green, the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries, and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding, Hill's foil, romantic and otherwise.  This season, as most, is simply advertised as ""based on characters created by"" McDermid, and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However, the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality, solid mysteries, with some of the well-known author's intensity; some of her edginess and grit, and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid, of course, is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home, you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent, lightened, a bit, by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot, which McDermid is, Scots-born.

At any rate, the series is set in McDermid's fictional ""Bradfield,"" it is filmed in Manchester, the actual city in which she sets her work, after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchester's an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here, full of interesting looking architecture, with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately, the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect, and there are no subtitles, a puzzling oversight considering Green's standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.

1. ""Colour of Amber.""  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street, in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery, dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.
2. ""Nocebo.""  A sadistic, ritualistic killer seems to be at work, targeting children.  Another strong, intense episode, more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be, giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher, Dr. Kingston.
3. ""Names of Angels."" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive, blond young businesswomen.  A clever, perhaps too clever, outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character, clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  ""Christopher"" has been a patient of Hill's while imprisoned for the crime, and, as he was so young when he committed it, he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.
4. ""Anything You Can Do."" Yet another apparent serial killer at work, putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one, but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of ""Christopher,"" the released Liverpool child murderer.

Green is, of course, a handsome man, and a good actor, and he gives us an intense, intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.  If only we could make out what he's saying.",1224720000,,3601,4.991624790619765
3167316,5,B00175GAKQ,"I have been a fan of this show since Season One, and Season Five continues the general excellence of the show.  The acting is quite solid, and I am glad to see the show has been able to retain two of the show's secondary characters; while playing back-up and fill-in roles to the two main actors, they add to the overall excellence.  The episodes for Season Five are all quite well written, with some interesting plot twists and red herrings for those who are trying to figure out ""who done it.""  For American fans, it is interesting to see how the ""Amber Alert"" system is set up in Bradfield, the location for the series, in ""The Color of Amber""; I did find the writing in this one episode to be at times a bit too convoluted with a few too many side stories going on.  Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.  My only complaint is that there are only a few episodes released each season (although they are nearly 90 minutes long a piece).  We want more Wire in the Blood!",1222041600,,1139,4.53170731707317

3167318,5,B00175GAKQ,"I've been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one, but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time, and less ""demented"" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written, produced, and directed in an entirely different style, e.g., the first one is fast-paced, with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds, while the second one is very grainy, jumpy, and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color, giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring, but it works extremely well.

Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol, but Alex is at least as compelling, if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula, as the ""minor"" characters, are superbly well written and well acted.

And then there's Tony, who is my ""small exception."" He's as charming and likeable as ever, if not more so, and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We don't really see just how much of a complete oddball he is. However, they more than made up for it in ""Prayer of the Bone"" so I can't really even call it a flaw.

If you like a truly suspenseful, intelligent, multi-layered drama, but previous episodes have left you uncertain about watching this series, give season five a try.",1219363200,5,1493,4.756756756756757

Episode One: Prayer of the Bone, was considered a ""special"" and is not included in the Season 5 Set. It is scheduled to be released as a separate DVD on August 5th 2008. Each episode is about 83 minutes in length. This is a quality series that seems to improve each year as the character delvelopment matures.

~ ~ SEASON 5 EPISODES ~ ~

Episode One: Prayer of the Bone

In the season premiere, Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) finds himself a fish out of water when he's invited to Texas as an expert witness in a case where an Iraq combat veteran has confessed to brutally slaughtering his wife and two young children. His defense team claims that he's suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but the prosecution asks Tony, who met with the soldier in the UK, to join them in disproving that claim. Alone in a strange country, surrounded by hostile lawyers and police, Tony finds himself at the center of a death penalty case with competing legal and political interests. He's insulted, threatened, framed, and physically attacked while the case takes a strange turn. Everyone seems to have a vested interest in the case - everyone except the suspect, who strangely seems determined to die.

Episode Two: The Color of Amber

When a woman sees a young girl being snatched by a man in a car, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) fears they may only have hours to get her back alive. Since only one percent of the victims in abduction cases survive beyond a day, new ACC James Morrison (Christopher Colquhoun) reacts by calling an Amber alert, which floods the media with public pleas for information. He also pulls Tony in to help with profiling likely abductors.

Episode Three: Nocebo

Alex investigates the murder of a teenage girl and a young boy, who bear signs of ritual killings. The trail leads to a property tycoon who'll stop at nothing to get the rent, a preacher whose healing activities involve animal sacrifice, and a self-styled artist whose works not only depict violence, but are painted in blood. Tony puzzles over what the killer might want to gain and why. Is this religion? And is it one killer or two, with one suspect the acolyte of another?

Episode Four: The Names of Angels

Two women are found raped and strangled, wearing the clothing of victims killed years earlier in Europe. Is the killer boasting to police about past crimes, leaving bodies where they can easily be found? And why is he choosing victims from the business world? As Tony tries to unravel the deadly puzzle, he's confronted by an unpleasant distraction - an 18-year-old released killer turns up on his doorstep.

Episode Five: Anything You Can Do

When a vulnerable elderly woman is suffocated in her home, Alex and Tony suspect Bernard Kelly (Ian Peck), a security guard who has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and was seen at the scene of the crime by several witnesses. But when the killings escalate, it appears to be the work of more than one murderer. Could the deaths be connected to the sudden return of Tony's old hero, respected psychologist Jonathan Goode?

goes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.",1234310400,,1301,4.230769230769231
3401810,5,B00175GAKQ,I caught an episode of Wire in the Blood - Nocebo as a rerun on HBO. I am completely won over by this intricate crime drama. I would recommend this show to anyone tired and bored by the endless stream of mindless trival 'reality' shows to get into this program to challenge their mind and engage the active part of their brain. Cast was well chosen and act as though this is not a program but real crime drama. Not wooden but includes little pieces of their lives away from the crime scene. A must see program. Robson Green is a superb actor. Not too know it all but human to make mistakes and regret them. Excellent,1233878400,2,616,4.273504273504273
3401811,5,B00175GAKQ,"Wire in the Blood is back in full force with an excellent season - great stories, well told & full of intrigue.  The extras on Disc 1 are also worth watching as they provide some interesting insights into the entire series.",1226361600,,223,4.439024390243903
3401812,4,B00175GAKQ,"""Wire in the Blood, Season 5,"" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial, based on the works of Val McDermid, to reach these shores.  The series, a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill, criminal profiler, is produced by Green's production company for the British Granada TV: he's one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here, which has been spun off as a standalone.

In addition to Green, the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries, and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding, Hill's foil, romantic and otherwise.  This season, as most, is simply advertised as ""based on characters created by"" McDermid, and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However, the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality, solid mysteries, with some of the well-known author's intensity; some of her edginess and grit, and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid, of course, is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home, you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent, lightened, a bit, by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot, which McDermid is, Scots-born.

At any rate, the series is set in McDermid's fictional ""Bradfield,"" it is filmed in Manchester, the actual city in which she sets her work, after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchester's an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here, full of interesting looking architecture, with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately, the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect, and there are no subtitles, a puzzling oversight considering Green's standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.

1. ""Colour of Amber.""  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street, in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery, dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.
2. ""Nocebo.""  A sadistic, ritualistic killer seems to be at work, targeting children.  Another strong, intense episode, more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be, giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher, Dr. Kingston.
3. ""Names of Angels."" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive, blond young businesswomen.  A clever, perhaps too clever, outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character, clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  ""Christopher"" has been a patient of Hill's while imprisoned for the crime, and, as he was so young when he committed it, he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.
4. ""Anything You Can Do."" Yet another apparent serial killer at work, putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one, but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of ""Christopher,"" the released Liverpool child murderer.

Green is, of course, a handsome man, and a good actor, and he gives us an intense, intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.  If only we could make out what he's saying.",1224720000,,3601,4.991624790619765
3401813,5,B00175GAKQ,"I have been a fan of this show since Season One, and Season Five continues the general excellence of the show.  The acting is quite solid, and I am glad to see the show has been able to retain two of the show's secondary characters; while playing back-up and fill-in roles to the two main actors, they add to the overall excellence.  The episodes for Season Five are all quite well written, with some interesting plot twists and red herrings for those who are trying to figure out ""who done it.""  For American fans, it is interesting to see how the ""Amber Alert"" system is set up in Bradfield, the location for the series, in ""The Color of Amber""; I did find the writing in this one episode to be at times a bit too convoluted with a few too many side stories going on.  Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.  My only complaint is that there are only a few episodes released each season (although they are nearly 90 minutes long a piece).  We want more Wire in the Blood!",1222041600,,1139,4.53170731707317

3401815,5,B00175GAKQ,"I've been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one, but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time, and less ""demented"" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written, produced, and directed in an entirely different style, e.g., the first one is fast-paced, with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds, while the second one is very grainy, jumpy, and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color, giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring, but it works extremely well.

Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol, but Alex is at least as compelling, if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula, as the ""minor"" characters, are superbly well written and well acted.

And then there's Tony, who is my ""small exception."" He's as charming and likeable as ever, if not more so, and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We don't really see just how much of a complete oddball he is. However, they more than made up for it in ""Prayer of the Bone"" so I can't really even call it a flaw.

If you like a truly suspenseful, intelligent, multi-layered drama, but previous episodes have left you uncertain about watching this series, give season five a try.",1219363200,5,1493,4.756756756756757

Episode One: Prayer of the Bone, was considered a ""special"" and is not included in the Season 5 Set. It is scheduled to be released as a separate DVD on August 5th 2008. Each episode is about 83 minutes in length. This is a quality series that seems to improve each year as the character delvelopment matures.

~ ~ SEASON 5 EPISODES ~ ~

Episode One: Prayer of the Bone

In the season premiere, Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) finds himself a fish out of water when he's invited to Texas as an expert witness in a case where an Iraq combat veteran has confessed to brutally slaughtering his wife and two young children. His defense team claims that he's suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but the prosecution asks Tony, who met with the soldier in the UK, to join them in disproving that claim. Alone in a strange country, surrounded by hostile lawyers and police, Tony finds himself at the center of a death penalty case with competing legal and political interests. He's insulted, threatened, framed, and physically attacked while the case takes a strange turn. Everyone seems to have a vested interest in the case - everyone except the suspect, who strangely seems determined to die.

Episode Two: The Color of Amber

When a woman sees a young girl being snatched by a man in a car, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) fears they may only have hours to get her back alive. Since only one percent of the victims in abduction cases survive beyond a day, new ACC James Morrison (Christopher Colquhoun) reacts by calling an Amber alert, which floods the media with public pleas for information. He also pulls Tony in to help with profiling likely abductors.

Episode Three: Nocebo

Alex investigates the murder of a teenage girl and a young boy, who bear signs of ritual killings. The trail leads to a property tycoon who'll stop at nothing to get the rent, a preacher whose healing activities involve animal sacrifice, and a self-styled artist whose works not only depict violence, but are painted in blood. Tony puzzles over what the killer might want to gain and why. Is this religion? And is it one killer or two, with one suspect the acolyte of another?

Episode Four: The Names of Angels

Two women are found raped and strangled, wearing the clothing of victims killed years earlier in Europe. Is the killer boasting to police about past crimes, leaving bodies where they can easily be found? And why is he choosing victims from the business world? As Tony tries to unravel the deadly puzzle, he's confronted by an unpleasant distraction - an 18-year-old released killer turns up on his doorstep.

Episode Five: Anything You Can Do

When a vulnerable elderly woman is suffocated in her home, Alex and Tony suspect Bernard Kelly (Ian Peck), a security guard who has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and was seen at the scene of the crime by several witnesses. But when the killings escalate, it appears to be the work of more than one murderer. Could the deaths be connected to the sudden return of Tony's old hero, respected psychologist Jonathan Goode?
