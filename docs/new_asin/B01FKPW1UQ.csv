7750278,5,B01FKPW1UQ,"I liked the film for different reasons. Overall it could have been produced better but the cinematography, wardrobe and locations made this a classic western. The acting from the family and other main cast was great. The supporting cast Clay comes across throughout the film fell short. There were a few edits I wish could have been changed but overall a solid western.",1465689600,2,369,4.873015873015873
7750279,1,B01FKPW1UQ,"Awful. Seriously painful to watch. Makes other B movies look amazing.  I am pretty forgiving when it comes to B movies and can usually just sit back and enjoy the effort.  This movie just demonstrates how bad it really can get. Can't believe people listed their name on the credits.. yes it really is that horrid.  ALL the acting was so wooden it actually made me feel uncomfortable, editing was distracting and made no sense, music was nauseating. The script...wow! - Bad on SO many levels.
I never write reviews, but someone has to warn others.  Keep looking for something else to watch and pass this one by....ANYTHING else you select will be better.  I promise. Sorry Kris.",1465689600,4,677,4.703389830508475

7750283,2,B01FKPW1UQ,"Purchased from Walmart - but same movie as listed here.  First half hour went smoothly (no filthy language) - but then all ""Hell"" broke loose after that. The father figure was most enjoyable part of movie - made story almost believable. Except for all the usual Hollywood smut talk and extremely excessive level of violence the move could have earned a 4 or 5 star rating. It looked like Stephen  King or Wes Craven got there hands on this script and the rest is history.  If you wish to find more quality Western style entertainment - then you will want to stay clear of this movie. Kris K. did his small share to redeem the move at very end. It deserved a 1**** but gave it a 2**** only because of the role the father played in doing the Right thing.",1512000000,,752,4.319148936170213

I watched some and turned it off for a couple days. Got it going again. Turned it off. Got to the part where he is on the train - threw it away.

Know how Bonanza is so bad it's good? This is just terrible and humorless, boring, improbable, terrible acting, lines, scenes are horribly choreographed, line deliveries are BAD and the dialogue is dumb. The shot sequences are just stupid. DUMB DUMB DUMB.

They always try to show 'hustle and bustle' on the streets of these tiny towns; just incessant couples walking hand in hand across the camera, horses, carriages, carts, blah blah.. so bad!

I'ma HUGE Kris fan, love his music and many of his movies. But he had no business being in this stupid movie.

Totally unwatchable. Straight to trash. I kept the box, turned the cover around and wrote the name of a movie I received from Amazon that that had a destroyed box. So hey! not a total waste",1504051200,,962,4.443181818181818

7750316,1,B01FKPW1UQ,"I lovingly give this film one star. It's bad. It's really bad. The people who are saying it isn't really bad -- there's something wrong with them. They need help, immediately. This isn't a difference of opinion. This isn't a matter of personal taste. This is an objectively terrible film. Fortunately, it crosses into 'so bad it's good territory,' just not intentionally.

It's jarringly disjointed. You're cruising along, thinking, 'this must have been written by Christians,' and then, BAM! Some totally disgusting, over the top line comes out of nowhere. It's enough that the dialects change from one minute to the next, but the whole tone changes, too. It feels like it was written by high schoolers.

So many tropes How did they pack so many worn out cliches into one movie? It's truly a feat. They even had that thing about the two wolves fighting and the one you feed is the one that wins -- you know, that thing that's been in every terrible action move the last few years? Yeah, they made that a big part of this story.

The photography doesn't stray from the old western cliches either. That shot of the rusty windmill with the sun behind it, the big, yellow moon to establish it's nighttime. It's good for a chuckle.

The sets give the impression that the old west was just as old 130 years ago as it is today. Not a spot of paint or a smooth board in sight. Apparently they liked that rustic look even in those days, kind of the architectural equivalent of pre-distressed jeans.

The little things help, like the medically incorrect reaction to a rattlesnake bite that would never have happened in the first place, the way the main character rides his horse at a dead sprint for miles and miles and somehow it doesn't die, the way Kansas looks mysteriously like Southern California, and perhaps my favorite, the shiny, stainless steel revolvers some of the characters used -- stainless steel guns didn't come into production until the 1960s.

It was missing one thing -- old world vultures. Let me explain. Western movies often have vultures picking at dead guys or dead animals or sitting around waiting for some guy or some animal to die, but Hollywood likes to use those big, long-necked vultures from Africa that look like cartoons, instead of the turkey vultures that actually live in the American west. This is the first time I've been disappointed not to see them, although, to be fair, I wasn't watching that closely through the last half hour or so. I didn't even realize Tom Sizemore was in the movie until I saw his name in the credits.

I could go on, but I won't. I recommend watching this film for a good laugh. It didn't end the way I thought it would -- with a big reveal exposing it as an elaborate prank. But it's still funny.",1480809600,,2756,4.612244897959184

I've even seen Trace Adkins in some acting roles and he isn't to bad either. But watching this piece of garbage was like watching a slow-motion train wreck. You knew it was horrible and was only going get worse, but you couldn't tear your eyes away from it. I'm not sure what has happened to Tom Sizemore, but he looked and sounded terrible. The only way that his acting could have been worse would have been if he started holding the script in front of him and reading. Kris Kristopherson looked like he wasn't sure where he even was. The cinematography was awful. The direction looked as though it was done by a middle school student. Seriously, if you want to see a good western, look for something that is NOT this.

7750350,4,B01FKPW1UQ,"TRADED is a fast paced, brutal, violent western with all the flavour of a traditional Sergio Leone spaghetti western.
It stars Michael Pare (born in NYC in 1958), who closely resembles Clint Eastwood , in appearance (with close shaved beard and moustache) and character (grim, tough, heroic) ,when he did the spaghetti western trilogy. The action never stops, this is a relentless chase/hunt film of  a father searching for his kidnapped daughter in the old west, some great outdoor scenery and nice train scenes. The violence , at times, is a bit hard to watch, like on Justified or The Sopranos.

Also co-starring is Kris Kristofferson, in one of his last roles, born on June 22, 1936 in Brownsville ,Texas,  age of 80..

This certainly isn't a movie for everyones tastes, because of the excessive violence/foul language,  but if you're a fan of the old traditional westerns, like Gunsmoke and The Rifleman, theres plenty of gunfights, bad guys,  revenge and a lot of shocking moments",1473206400,5,986,4.945454545454545

7750357,3,B01FKPW1UQ,"Traded is a gritty revenge tale set on the Western frontier twenty years after the Civil War. Sharpshooter turned rancher Clay Travis (Michael Pare) goes from happily married father of two to a man on a mission after the disappearance of his 17-year-old daughter, Lily (Brittany Elizabeth Williams). Clay leaves his quiet ranch and heads to Wichita where, after confronting the ruthless Ty Stover (Trace Adkins), he discovers that Lily has been traded away into an underground sex ring in Dodge City. There, with the help of old barkeep Billy (Kris Kristofferson), Clay makes a stand to bring his daughter home.

The film draws upon others for inspiration, particularly John Fords The Searchers, as well as the more recent Taken. The mixing of the Western genre with the theme of forced prostitution is novel but merely the linchpin on which to hang lots of violence. Director Timothy Woodard, Jr., has fashioned a traditional Western with all the bells and whistles  colorful characters, frontier lawlessness, fight scenes, and a cause worth fighting for, in this case, family.

Tom Sizemore plays Lavoie, a sadistic villain who takes pleasure in torturing his victims. Kristofferson has a face made for Westerns with its deep wrinkles and eyes that suggest hes seen it all. As the barkeep, hes a more serious version of Gabby Hayes  a reliable sidekick whose age belies his ability with a gun. Also notable is the films depiction of how harsh life was for a woman in the Old West, unusual in a genre that typically takes the masculine point of view.

Bonus extras on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette and deleted scenes (with and without commentary).",1470096000,11,1688,5.014285714285714

7750362,1,B01FKPW1UQ,"As trite and simplistic as a children's film, yet weirdly punctuated with out-of-place language and violence, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is something strange about the dialogue in this film--very few of the accents are convincing. It's as though we are watching a film made by a church youth group (and the beginning of the film feels drenched in some kind of moralistic ""wholesomeness"") which then tried to prove itself with an awkward degree of gratuitous shock value. The main character cycles through a repetitive series of confrontations with the owners of brothels which begins to feel oddly redundant. The story line could be distilled into: sheltered girl lives with overbearing, overprotective, ""loving"" parents who end up driving her away by being too restrictive and oppressive; girl decides to strike out on her own against her parents' will (big mistake for her to venture away from their protective authority into the sinful world where her naivete leaves her vulnerable without male guardianship); daddy fights the bad guys to rescue his daughter from becoming a whore; young woman is returned to the safety of her isolated existence with mom and dad apparently to never grow up and become an individual. It's like some kind of message film aimed at home-schoolers about why one should stay under mom and dad's sheltering wings and never enter the world, but this down-home, conservative message is confusingly contradicted by the violence and language. I honestly don't get the point of this film or the motivation of whoever made it. The girl, who is the center of the story, ends being ignored by the film with all focus instead being put on the male character. We never see the girl go through any meaningful character development, transformation, or growth as a result of her experiences; rather, she simply serves as a thing to be rescued by the father character. Neither do we see the parents undergo any lesson or realization of their own responsibility in driving their daughter away because of their own behavior. (Rather, it's the girl's willful desire to have a life that makes her parents suffer.) Kristofferson's farewell moment in the film is the sappiest, most overdone bit of cheesy dialogue imaginable. One can imagine this kind of dialogue working in another film, with better editing and more of a relationship between the characters, but here it's just cringe worthy. What an unconvincing, lousy, piece of [to hear this censored word, please watch the film, which if not for such words, would otherwise have the intellectual equivalent of material for an adolescent Sunday School class].",1469404800,,2651,5.041002277904328

That being said, this is essentially a western version of Taken. Adkins is a little over the top in this, but it works.

8760945,4,B01FKPW1UQ,"RELEASED IN 2016 and directed by Timothy Woodward Jr., ""Traded"" stars Michael Par as a father ruthlessly pursuing his runaway daughter (Brittany Elizabeth Williams) who has fallen prey to slavers in the prostitution trade. Trace Adkins plays an intimidating saloon owner while Kris Kristofferson is on hand as a bartender seeking redemption from the filth hes forced to live amidst. Tom Sizemore plays a nasty buyer in the slave-whore business.

This is a low-budget Western that has some technical weaknesses, like dubious continuity/editing, but a compelling story, gritty tone, brutal violence and fine locations, costuming & score. If you don't appreciate dark, violent modern Grade B Westerns like Hickok (2017) and 6 Guns (2010) don't bother. The plot is obviously a melding of Hardcore (1979) and Taken (2008) in the Old West, but without the blockbuster resources. There are a lot of UN-pleasant elements as we see what those saloon babes REALLY had to go through in the Old West.

There are some unexpected highlights, like Marie Oldenbourg as Girl in a meaty subplot, but the way it concludes (the subplot) is a missed opportunity. As dark and brutal as the movie is, there are thankfully brief rays of light, hope, reverence and (hopefully) happiness.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 38 minutes and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California and areas nearby. WRITER: Mark Esslinger.
