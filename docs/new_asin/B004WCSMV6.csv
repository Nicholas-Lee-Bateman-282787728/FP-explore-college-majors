8444959,5,B004WCSMV6,"Video quality isn't like an HD movie but we get this movie for every little girl we know who is potty training! Mainly because my daughter stars in it, but still everyone always loves it and watches it over and over again to the point that they need to buy another copy!",1442880000,,270,4.211538461538462
8444960,5,B004WCSMV6,"My daughter loves this DVD - she has proven to be pretty stubborn about potty training.  She loves the little songs, etc.  After multiple viewings, she literally got up during the middle of this DVD, yelled ""I have to go!"" in sync with a scene in the DVD and peed on the potty for the first time after months of begging her to go on potty.",1398038400,,339,4.121212121212121
8444961,5,B004WCSMV6,"I saved money on this by renting it from the local library. The video is awful quality the voices didn't match up with the cartoon, but my daughter didn't care she loved the show.  She was potty trained in 2 weeks. The video was all I did. She watched it while sitting on the potty. She is 2.5 years old.",1381190400,,304,4.066666666666666
8444962,5,B004WCSMV6,This video really helped my daughter. It may not be the most enjoyable for adults to watch over and over but the kids love it and it really did help her out.,1320710400,2,157,3.9375
