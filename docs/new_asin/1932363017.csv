7801531,5,1932363017,"Cialdini was a professor of mine in the mid 1970s.  As a a Senior Executive in a Healthcare Fortune 500 company, I employ his techniques every day in my professional life.  One insight he shared with me as a student involved a question concerning three lions: a ferocious one, an average one and a docile one.  He asked me this:  ""Gail, if you were a lion tamer, which lion would you engage (tame) first?""  Of course I picked the docile one, as I am not particularly brave or into taming wild animals!  Cialdini told me my answer was incorrect.  He explained that if I tamed (persuaded) the most aggressive lion first, all the other lions would fall into place.  What am amazing insight!!  At the time he may have been framing the argument for authority, as people tend to follow other people in authority. -  Over 2 decades later, in my professional life as a Senior Project Manager, I was faced with a similar situation when implementing a lab system in 8 hospitals.  The head of the Lab Department in a pilot facility under consideration had no intention of going up on any ""newfangled enterprise-wide lab system!""  Imagine the surprise of my project team when I selected *his* site as our pilot facility, when I had so many others from which to choose.  But because he was a ""lion"" who was extremely vocal and very respected (authority) and I knew if I could gain *his* trust and acceptance, all the other ""lions"" would fall into place.  This is EXACTLY what happened.  I had a very successful implementation across the board .Just one example of the ""power of persuasion.""  A nugget like that is worth its weight in gold.",1411776000,,1626,4.59375
7801532,1,1932363017,I was really disappointed with this video. It adds nothing more than the book and costs 5 times as much. Cialdini doesn't answer the questions he poses at the beginning of his lecture nor does he add any examples beyond those he has already written about in his book. His messianic style (popping eyes) is distracting and verges on hilarious. Don't bother to buy this video.,1142726400,5,374,4.681818181818182
7801533,5,1932363017,Dr. Cialdini's style is engaging and meaningful.  This is a must see for any sales organization.,1091750400,3,96,5.0
