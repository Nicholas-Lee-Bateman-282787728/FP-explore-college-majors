5720883,5,B00CERJIOG,"For those who have read Mohsin Hamid's brilliant novel on which this film is  based the story will be easier to follow than the somewhat disconnected screenplay that was written by Hamid with Ami Boghani and William Wheeler.  Mira Nair directs, and knowing her previous work suggests that it is this very disconnect that she wishes to emphasize in this profoundly moving film - in these times of global unrest and fear because of terrorist acts we don't know who to trust and who to dislike, but the answer is that there is no right or wrong. Nair achieves this by beginning her film with a conversation between an American journalist Bobby (Liev Schreiber) and a Pakistani professor Changez (Riz Ahmed) in a setting of high tension in a bar in Lahore and our initial belief is that the Bobby represents the core we trust and with whom we identify, that Changez is the unknown `different culture' stranger who is suspect. In the course of the film that position is deeply altered. And that is where the power of the message is so affecting.  But we must go through flashbacks of eleven years to understand the real drama.

Changez Khan (the very handsome and very fine actor Riz Ahmed) lives with his poet father Abu (Om Purl) and mother Ammi (Shabana Azmi) in Pakistan. The family is poor but educated and Changez decides to go to America to find his place in the corporate world of money and success - and help support his family (his sister is ready to marry but the family can ill afford a traditional wedding). Changez arrives in America, attends university, and rises rapidly, gaining a position with a Wall Street company that specializes in financial advising for business internationally. The head of the company Jim Cross (Kiefer Sutherland) personally picks Changez after testing his skills and sends Changez on missions to the Philippines etc where he examines the finances, cuts waste (and jobs of workers) and makes the businesses run efficiently, increase profits, but sacrificing the working class. On one such mission Changez is asked to analyze a publishing house in Istantbul, the owner  Nazmi (Haluk Bilginer) has translated Changez' fathers poetry into Turkish, and pleads with Changez not to destroy his publishing house. Cross demands Changez shut it down and Changez refuses and submits his resignation. As he prepares to pack to return, jobless, to the US he is watching television and the twin towers of 9/11 are being attacked. His attempts to return to the US are met with police and airport interrogations since he is not a native born American, and this allows the viewer to witness the horrible and demeaning treatment `foreigners' received in the wake of 9/11.

Changez does return to New York and has another setback with his photographer artist girlfriend Erica (Kate Hudson), herself deeply bruised by the loss of her lover in a car crash she caused in the recent past, who has an art opening that includes videos and images of bits of conversation she has shared with Changez - information which in the exhibition further underlines the concept of Changez as a potential terrorist. Changez flees to Pakistan, becomes an anti-violence but fiery professor whose students seek to rid their Pakistan of the American intruders. And this is where the conversation at film's beginning ultimately makes sense (it is now 2011).  The manner in which the film ends is left for the viewer to experience.
As in the book there are many sidebar stories and characters that underline the stories of both Bobby (who has been talked into joining the CIA) and Changez who moves from his love of the American Dream and his sweetheart, to his spiritual commitment to his Pakistan. These characters, as well as many others in this film, allow us to see there is no one way to view acts as right or wrong.  It is all perception and hopefully this brilliant film will assist us in understanding the confusion that deeply affects us all everyday as we walk around the topic of terrorism.

5720884,4,B00CERJIOG,"The film version was well acted and held my interest but did supplement the plot of the book to a great extent.  However, given the first person long monologue narrative form of the novel, it would be impossible to translate that to film without action additions. The film ending lost the ambiguity of the novel's ending.",1437782400,,321,4.732142857142857
5720885,5,B00CERJIOG,"I was completely blown away by this movie.  The story begins as an American professor working at Lahore University is kidnapped by Islamic fundamentalists.  A journalist,  Schrieber, goes to interview Changez Khan, a young Pakistani professor about his ideals and how he is stirring his students into action against America.  The first thing that Changez says to the reporter is ""Looks can be deceiving.""  That really is the theme behind everything in this movie.  Changez is an ivy league educated financial analyst with one of the top firms in the world, just starting a brilliant career, when the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center occurs.  Changez is as shocked as everyone else but because of his ethnicity, he is targeted over and over again by people who see him as a possible threat.  His anger and frustration lead him to change his way of life and return to his home country to become a professor.  Is he a radical fundamentalist?  Is he involved in the abduction of the professor?  The truth comes out as the interview progresses.  By the end of the movie, his point is proven in a very dramatic fashion.  The movie opened my eyes to what Muslim Americans go through in these times of terrorism both abroad and at home.  An entire group of people can't be painted in one broad stroke. It's only through getting to know people, that we learn their stories.",1437350400,2,1369,4.697478991596639
5720886,1,B00CERJIOG,"If you subscribe to the narrative that America is ""The Great Satan"", and that even the most gentle, open-minded, ""reluctant"" Muslims should hate our guts, this is the movie for you. Within that deceptive and demagogic context, the movie has much to offer in terms of acting, directing, location and especially the music. The opening scene features the song Kangna by Fareed Ayaz and Abu Muhammad, which immediately transports the viewer out of the Judaeo-Christian world and into the heart of Islamic Pakistan.

The film, appealing to the prejudices of knee-jerk, anti-American liberals, naturally takes a cheap-shot at capitalism, represented in the film by managing director Kiefer Sutherland at a heartless Goldman Sachs type firm, while lionizing the profession (and free spirit) of a free-lance photographer, until she commits the inexcusable offense of incorporating a Muslim into her work. The implicit message is that you can dip a crucifix into a bucket of urine and call it art, but if you examine the experience of Muslims in America there aren't enough infidel heads to justifiably lop off.

The film is very well made, but transparent in its anti-American bias.",1437350400,3,1174,5.2063492063492065
5720887,4,B00CERJIOG,"This is very much a ""slice of life"" movie. How is it that a high-flying Wall Street whiz-kid whose only ambition ever has been to make a ton of money can end up seemingly aiding and abetting Islamic extremism? The story takes us, step-by-step, along the life of an aspiring Pakistani yuppie and shows how the moronic paranoia and heavy-handed mindless bureaucratic response of American officials across all departments and walks of life to the terrible events of 9/11 end up alienating many of the very people who were the USA's strongest advocates. While there's nothing new in the idea that government employees are bottom-of-the-barrel types who are virtually guaranteed to do the wrong thing in the wrong way, or that the police are more often than not little more than uniformed thugs, the power of this story lies not with any one brutal incident but rather with how it shows the gradual accretion of unnecessary and counter-productive acts against the protagonist gradually undermine his affection for the USA and his idea of what his life's purpose should be.

Sadly, while we as an audience may enjoy the movie and learn its lessons it is exceptionally unlikely that any such lessons will ever be learned by any government official or department whatsoever. The systemic problems with officialdom in the USA are so deep and so entrenched that nothing is going to alter what remains a chronic situation. Whether invading the wrong country (Iraq) or abusing the wrong person, American officialdom can too often be relied on to be utterly mindless, fake-macho heavy-handed, and thereby create the very problems it believes itself to be attacking. This movie shows, in miniature, how such a state of affairs comes to be. While most white middle-class Americans live in a Disney fantasy world in which they genuinely believe the USA is the ""land of the brave and home of the free"" the reality is quite different. This movie takes us behind the faade and reveals a small slice of the reality presented to those unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of officials whose IQ is invariably smaller than their hat size.

Perhaps most telling is the reaction of the protagonist's sort-of American girlfriend. The offspring of a wealthy family, this pampered ""artist"" is as emotionally damaged and intellectually lazy as most rich folk seem to be, and she ends up using the ""material"" she gleaned from her relationship with her Pakistani boyfriend in an art show that completely misrepresents him in every possible way by pandering to the post-9/11 stereotypes promulgated by the mass media and the lazy prejudice of her family and friends. Thus the protagonist finds himself betrayed by everyone he thought was part of his life in the USA and everything he thought he valued - and that valued him.

America and Americans don't come out well in this movie, and the frightening thing is that it's all so reasonable and realistic. People did switch off what passed for their brains in order to feel solidarity with the fake-macho posturing of George Junior and his cronies. People did, and continue to do, pointlessly self-defeating things in the name of ""patriotism"" and ""homeland security.""  The USA lost the aftermath of 9/11 because of the weight of small details and everyone was impoverished as a result.

This movie should be a wake-up call, but sadly it won't be.",1435708800,3,3368,4.943462897526501

5720900,3,B00CERJIOG,"The novel was eloquent and amazing.  It involves a long monologue between Changez and a listener who from all indications appears to be a CIA type.  This novel truly allows the reader to place themselves in the mind of a person from Pakistan who immigrated to the USA.  It allows us to realize how much of the world must view us and our policies towards other countries.  It also allows us to recognize the human effects of ""profits"" without regard to human costs.

The movie did the same but fell short.  In the novel, the charismatic eloquent speaker carries an underlying tone of threat as he deals with his CIA listener.  The movie makes it more of a mutual discussion to resolve a kidnapping and avoid the death of another CIA agent.  The movie ""toned down"" and attempted to make the speaker seem more helpless and sympathetic.

My advice?  Read the novel and all the others by this author.  He is well worth the investment.  See the movie as a usual tone down sanitized version of the real thing. IT's interesting to watch but abandons the real character of the novel upon which it was based",1402099200,3,1097,4.540816326530612

Unfortunately, the explanation given by the movie did not add to my understanding but it was interesting to watch.  The character development from successful Wall Street trader to Pakistani sympathizer requires more insight.  I would have shortened the first half of the movie and put more emphasis and clarification on the second half as he starts to turn.  The lost love relationship was well done.  The character's relationship to his father, his Pakistani friends and colleagues needs to be developed.  The last ten minutes of the film, where his mind has already changed, pass by too quickly.  I would have appreciated more  emphasis here but perhaps this requires the reading of the novel.  Wonderfully acted.  I would watch the film again with friends in order to have the chance to discuss it more thoroughly.",1398297600,,929,5.052631578947368
5720903,3,B00CERJIOG,"One of the best assets of The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Mira Nairs ambitious thriller drama, is the talented players, especially Riz Ahmed as Changez Khan, a professor at Lahore University. When one of his colleagues (who is an American) is kidnapped, Changez, suspected of getting involved in the case, recounts his life story to a journalist Bobby Lincoln (Liev Schreiber).

In flashbacks set in the pre- and post-9/11 America, Changez, son of a renowned poet, tells the story of his life in Wall Street when he was a young and able financial analyst. He also meets an aspiring photographer Erica (Kate Hudson) and starts dating her.

Based on a book by a Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist tries to cover too many topics at the same time, eventually losing its focus along the way. As a thriller the film is ineffective, with the kidnapping story hardly developed. Changezs own experiences in America are more interesting and convincing, but his romance with Erica, one-dimensional character, does not ring true.

Despite the unique perspective the film offers about the immediate subject matter and strong performances from the cast, The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a rather disappointing work from the director of The Namesake.",1397779200,,1257,5.243781094527363

All lead actors are sharp and at the top of their game.

The film is based on the 2008 novel by Mohsin Hamid, and it's possible that Amy Boghani and William Wheeler's adapation moves the story a little to quickly to give full weight to the wrenching internal changes that young Changez has to make.

The storyline centers around Changez Khan, who upon graduating from Princeton, finds success (at least in the conventional definition) as an analyst at a top Manhattan firm.  He also meets Erica, a photographer, with whom he begins a complicated relationship.  While he is away on business, he sees the news clip of the 9/11 attacks, and this is where the plot twists begin.  When his character returns to NY and is constantly condemned and harassed based on his ethnicity and appearance, the viewer feels real sympathy for him.  Later in the story, though, the plot gets (purposefully or unintentionally?) more convoluted and it is difficult to see where, if anywhere, Khan stands.  The viewer's feelings for the narrator become more complex and sometimes contradictory, though the story is gripping as ever.

Excellent acting by Riz Ahmed and Kiefer Sutherland made the dialogue believable and interesting, though the other actors and characters were somewhat forgettable.  There were a lot of loose ends at the conclusion of the film, especially with the romance angle, which were a little bothersome.

We are then carted back to 2001 to explain how we got to be in a tea house in Pakistan discussing the kidnapping of a US citizen and lecturer. In 2001 Changez managed to land a job with top American consultant firm Underwood Samson. They are the people that turn up and make a company more efficient, mainly by re shaping personnel or `sacking' as we used to call it. He is spotted by corporate nasty played by Kiefer Sutherland.

Then September 11th happens and it is a game changer he also grows a beard which seems to attract way too much attention from the authorities even if it is a bit unkempt. So he returns to Pakistan having had his ambition singed by his overseas experiences, once at home he starts to mix with people who are much closer to their religion than him and have a whole different way of thinking. What follows is a story of intrigue and religion and a mighty clash of cultures in all senses.

This is a quietly intense film that is often full of suspense, the acting is all excellent. Bobby Lincoln is played by Liev Schreiber (`X-Men Origins' and `Defiance') and he is ruddy excellent. We also have an appearance from Indian screen legend Om Puri which was a nice touch.

This has good production values and nice attention to detail; and even at 130 minutes did not out stay its welcome. It is always hard to deal in a balanced way with such thorny issues as `fundamentalism' or `radicalisation' but I think director Mira Nair has done a very good job. This was an adaptation of the book by Moshin Hamad who also co wrote the screen play so they have tried to capture the spirit of the book and succeeded to a large extent. An intriguing and thought provoking film that I actually really enjoyed and hope you will too.",1379462400,3,1895,4.439655172413793

5720933,5,B00CERJIOG,"Reading the plot blurb at the rental store for this movie made it sound intriguing, but when I saw it was also directed by Mira Nair, who did such good jobs on the entertaining yet emotionally deep Monsoon Wedding, Salaam Bombay! and The Namesake, I knew it would be good, but I didn't know how moving it would be, nor profound in it's deeper reminder that looks can be (and often are) deceiving.

Without wanting to say too much and give away the story which keeps the suspense and drama taut and fast paced, I want to add my 2cents worth to those who say this is a great story with interesting twists and layers of realistic emotion, leading to a vision of humanity that is perhaps more optimistic than is currently warranted (in reality we'd have seen the launch of a deadly drone near the ending...). It brings up issues of Western hegemony, terrorism and national security, personal ambition and integrity (and in this way reminds me of the less nuanced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana/dp/B000HF6XKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana</a>), but even more universally it is the classic story of how we as individuals are all challenged by, and perhaps eventually overcome, the urge to react with anger and negativity, and get sucked into that which we are wanting to rise above.

I now look forward to reading Hamid's novel.

As engaging as the premise for The Reluctant Fundamentalist is, I am afraid it was made just a little too late for American audiences to care. There was a wave of post-9/11 dramas dealing with the aftermath of the tragic terrorist attacks, and The Reluctant Fundamentalist would have been a spectacular follow-up to those films, but instead comes when audiences seem to be straying further from this dark period of recent American history. That being said, director Mira Nair is able to breathe as much life as the narrative can hold with energetic filmmaking.

  Adapted from the novel by Mohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist tells the story of a Pakistani professor who the CIA suspects of involvement in the kidnapping of an American academic. A reporter (Liev Schreiber) is sent to interview Professor Changez (Riz Ahmed) in order to determine his involvement, and much of the film is flashbacks as the Pakistani man explains his journey to the American reporter.

  There is a tense aspect in the storyline dealing with the mystery of Changez' involvement in the kidnapping and the reporter's ability to escape unharmed, but much of the movie deals with much more personal elements. We are told through flashbacks of the young ambitious journey Changez took to the United States, studying and eventually acquiring a desired career on Wall Street before the attacks on the United States made the entire world seem harsher. We watch as the city turns against Changez because of the way he looks, and the way that it turns him into a bitter person. The main focus for this alteration in his personality is shown through the devastation of two significant relationships; the one he has with an American artist (Kate Hudson) who uses him as the inspiration for her artwork, and his boss and mentor (Kiefer Sutherland).

  At times The Reluctant Fundamentalist is altogether engaging, though the pieces of the film don't all seem to come together fluidly. It ends up feeling like a series of vignettes involving the same person, but some of the variation in the film's mood shift too much for one film to contain. It attempts to be a drama, but at times has aspirations to be a thriller. These sequences aren't bad, but don't feel as though they belong in the same film as the rest.

I personally approved of any changes made to the plot, and the message was a lot more clear and loud in the movie!

He becomes stuck in a position that no one wants. Not only dealing with a hostage crisis but he has to decide between his American dream and his homeland. This is a movie that sounded very interesting to me and I sat down hoping for something completely different. While the movie has good acting and an intriguing idea it was just soooooo slow moving and boring that I found myself losing interest and focus throughout and I missed some of what was going on due to boredom. There really isn't much more to say about this. You may have a different take on this but I got bored and found myself not really caring about what happens and more how much longer till its over.

5720941,5,B00CERJIOG,"This is a movie in which scene after scene, and many of the statements made in the film, are deeply layered and nuanced; perhaps some of that is lost in the thriller level of what is going on. I did NOT find this film to be ""anti-American"" but then, I have lived in Asia and perhaps have more ability to put myself in the shoes of people in these places. In fact, what struck me most of all is how some people undergoing upheaval and violence in their countries, societies and families ABSTAIN from violence in the face of such abysmal injustice. The profiling happened after 911 and it still does; it's part of human nature to succumb to ignorance and seek others to blame or to make facile assumptions about other societies and religions, especially Islam. (for the record, I'm a Buddhist).
The movie begs for deeper exploration of what ""fundamentalism"" really means. IT MAKES US THINK. We seem to associate it primarily with radical Islam, but this movie points out that capitalism itself is yet another ""ism"" subject to injustice and evil. We see it in the behavior of many corporations, including the one Changez works for in America.
One of my favorite scenes is where Changez is teaching in the classroom, telling his students (only a few years younger than himself) that he has lived ""the American dream"" and now he wants to ask them: ""What is the Pakistani Dream""? And it made me think even bigger: what it the dream for each of us and for the world we live in?
One thing I did not find workable was Kate Hudson as a ""match"" for Changez. I'd rather have seen Penelope Cruz, for example--just physically AND tempermentally more proportionate.
Riz Ahmed is an actor the camera loves and his presence fills the screen for most of the film.
All the actors were exceptional. There was so much ""action"" that I felt some of the deeper points were glossed over, but still found this a very compelling movie and one I would see again, which I rarely do.
ADDITIONAL COMMENT 6/30/13: After seeing the movie, I read the book, and it's hard to tell it's the same story at all. I actually did NOT like the book. It was much more ambiguous and was a one-way conversation that felt at times stilted and pretentious, and certainly you could read anything into the main characters' motives you wanted to. I read three or four books a week, but this one was disappointing.",1370649600,7,2362,4.57311320754717
5720942,4,B00CERJIOG,"""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" (2013 release; 128 min.) brings the story of Changez (played by Riz Ahmed), a brilliant minded Pakistani who sought (and achieved) success on Wall Street, but now apparently is embroiled in a kidnapping scheme of a US professor teaching at Lahore University. As the movie opens, we see the kidnapping taking place, and a US reporter (played by Liev Schreiber) tries to figure out what really happened. He is eventually linked up with Changez, who promises to tell him ""the whole story"" if he is prepared to hear him out. The reporter agrees, and from that moment on Changez retells his story, going back 10+ years from his days at Princeton where he excelled both in academics and in soccer. Changez charms a Wall Street-type (played by Keifer Sutherland) and hence lands a job at a prestigious Wall Street firm. There he also climbs the ranks quickly, and along the way gets to meet (and fall in love with) Erica (played by Kate Hudson). In September, 2011, Changez and several colleagues visit the Philippines on a business trip, and while there 9/11 takes place, much to the horror of Changez and his colleagues. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, the movie is quite critical of the US, despite the repeated claims of Changez that he is ""a lover of the United States"". Mostly, the post-9/11 days, featuring racial profiling, are played up to the max. I found it frankly unbelievable when Changez and his colleagues return from the Philippines that Changez would be picked up as they are walking in the airport even before they get to US immigration and right in front of the Changez' boss (a top man on Wall Street). I am not suggesting that racial profiling did not happen post-9/11, but am suggesting that the portrayal of it in the movie feels unauthentic. Second, you only need to see who financed the movie (Doha Film Institute) as a possible explanation of the overall tone of the movie. Third, the title of the movie is quite misleading as the Changez character, deeply flawed as it is, is frankly neither reluctant nor, in my opinion, fundamentalist (but judge for yourself). Fourth, Kate Hudson fans alert! After umpteen recent and forgettable rom-com movie roles (""Bride Wars"", etc.), Hudson finally plays a more dramataic character, and reminds us how good she can really be. Fifth, Indigo Girls fans alert! Amy Ray plays a short cameo as herself, bringing a solo song (""Measure of Me"") as Changez and Erica meet up in a bar. In fact the soundtrack of the movie is done very nicely (check out also Peter Gabriel's ""Bol"" playing over the closing credits). Last but not least, the movie was shot on location in a bunch of places (including Pakistan, India, Turkey, New York), which really adds to the movie.

I have quite ambivalent feelings about this movie. The movie flew by in no time, so it is not lacking in entertainment value. But when I started reflecting about what I had just seen, the shortcomings of the movie became more apparent to me. The screening where I saw this at (E Street Landmark Theatre in Washington, DC) was very well attended, which I found encouraging. Bottom line, warts and all, I would encourage you to check out ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"", be it in the theatre or on DVD, so that you can see and judge for yourself.",1368403200,6,3423,4.741610738255034
5720943,3,B00CERJIOG,"I read the book a few years ago after reading a review in the Wall Street Journal or the Economist. The book was wonderful and very nuanced. The movie by about halfway displays none of the nuance or subtlety of the book and really scene after scene shows Americans (principally in the form of the CIA, FBI and police) as simple-minded thugs ignorant of the truth, which of course Changez and everyone else in his circle in Pakistan has cornered the market in with their superior intellect and sense of justice.  In this sense the movie was a let-down because the novel was far more complex than this and the screenwriter failed to really bring the book to the screen. At times I felt like I could be watching an anti-America propaganda film- the scenes were that overt.
  Still, the cinematography was excellent, the story was interest if too one dimensional, the acting was good and I really enjoyed the Pakistani folk music.",1368316800,14,926,4.668711656441718
