8753779,5,B01CQC7DL8,"Although somewhat dated, this documentary is applicable to what is happening to persons with mental disorders in prisons.  After deinstitutionalization of state mental hospitals, we entered a period of transinstitutionalization, which resulted in the criminalization of persons with mental disorders.  Despite Ohio's positive efforts, we are missing the mark in our society with regard to persons with mental disorders.  Our government, policy makers, and the media have created a damaging myth that persons with mental disorders are violent and dangerous.  Although a few are, most are not.  This myth has allowed federal and state governments to marginalize and ostracize persons with mental disorders by incarcerating them.  This video is outstanding in demonstrating this tragedy.",1515369600,,784,5.833333333333333
