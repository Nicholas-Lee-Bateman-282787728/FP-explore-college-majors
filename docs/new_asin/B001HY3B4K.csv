3645299,2,B001HY3B4K,"If your expecting high qulaity films the you have come to the wrong place cause you will not find any in this collection. I thought I knew what letterbox video was till I watched the first 2 films on disk 2, also so films taken from VHS as you have the video roll, and even the dirty heads with no picture in some of these film. If your a spagetti Western film collector what can yuou do,. this is just the nature of the beast. Added to my collection, but if I wasn't a collector and just a watcher I would pass this deal up unless I cam across it in the 3 dollar bin.  (1-28-13)",1359331200,,579,3.9913793103448274
3645300,2,B001HY3B4K,"Unfortunately, not all the films on this DVD are in good condition. BLOOD AT SUNDOWN comes from a VHS copy that has been preserved on DVD before tape drop ruins it entirely. SARTANA ANGEL OF DEATH freezes ten minutes before the end and, as another post has noted, one Hunt Powers version has been recorded from TV with the channel logo clearly visible on the right bottom and is also cropped like the first.",1305590400,3,407,4.513513513513513
3645301,4,B001HY3B4K,"The picture quality varies from film to film, but all are watchable (excepting  ~30 seconds lost in Blood at Sundown) and some are very good.

Although this set doesn't contain every film with Sartana in the title or referencing the character Sartana, it does include every one starring Gianni Garko, and eight of the ten movies included are ranked in [...] members' poll of the top 148.  Only one of the ""missing Sartanas"" appear in this list of favorites.  I think the producers are entitled to call this the complete saga because of the inclusion of all ""offical"" Sartana flicks.

There can be title confusion, so here is my list of the ten movies in this collection:

1. Django and Sartana's Showdown in the West/ One Damned Day at Dawn: Django Meets Sartana/Django and Sartana
2. Django and Sartana are Coming, It's the End/Django vs. Sartana
3. Have a Good Funeral, My Friend, Sartana Will Pay
4. I am Sartana, Your Angel of Death
5. Blood at Sundown/A Thousand Dollars on the Black/Sartana (Germany)
6. If You Meet Sartana, Pray for Your Death
7. Price of Death
8. Sartana in the Valley of Death
9. Light the Fuse, Sartana is Coming
10. Sartana's here: Trade Your Pistols for a Coffin/ A Fistful of Lead",1245628800,24,1210,4.630841121495327
3645302,4,B001HY3B4K,"I haven't watched all the movies yet, just spot-checked them, but since Video Asia is known for bad quality I figured it might be helpful to give a quality heads-up.  As Video Asia collections go, the quality on this one was much better than most of their products... but, it's still Video Asia, so don't expect too much.  I checked these on a regular old tube TV... if you have a high-def flatscreen it'll probably look worse.

Have A Good Funeral, Amigo... - runs 1 hr. 32 min. 11 sec.  Sharp widescreen picture.

Sartana: Angel of Death - runs 1 hr. 33 min. 46 sec.  Sharp, widescreen.

Blood At Sundown - runs 1 hr. 39 min. 44 sec.  Slightly faded reddish print, mastered off a VHS with some tape damage, causing jittering and some digitization of the picture.  Slightly letterboxed.

If You Meet Sartana, Pray For Your Death - 1 hr. 30 min. 30 sec.  Letterboxed, sharp, maybe a bit greenish.

Light The Fuse, Sartana is Coming - 1 hr. 35 min. 24 sec.  Sharp, letterboxed.

I Am Sartana Trade Your Guns for a Coffin - 1 hr. 31 min. 14 sec.  Full-frame, picture's slightly soft and faded

Price of Death - 1 hr. 28 min. 30 sec.  Letterboxed, sharp.

Sartana in the Valley of Death - 1 hr. 18 min. 43 sec. Letterboxed, sharp.

One Damed Day At Dawn Django Meets Sartana - 1 hr. 21 min. 55 sec. Sharp and letterboxed (but the letterboxing may be fake matting, since it looks a bit odd)

Django & Sartana Are Coming, It's The End - 1 hr. 23 min. 42 sec.  Full frame, not very sharp but not terrible.  There's a ""7"" bug in the lower right corner all the time, burned into whatever tape this was dubbed from.  If you're one of those people who lose their mind over watermarking, this will make you apoplectic.

This is hardly the ""complete"" Satana, since there's no ""Django Challenges Sartana,"" no ""Sartana Kills Them All,"" no ""Sartana Does Not Forgive""... not even ""Trinity & Sartana, Those Dirty S.O.B.'s"" which is readily available on cheap DVD collections.  But, since most of these films are hard to track down otherwise and was raised in the days of VHS bootlegs so can handle less-than-pristine quality, I was quite happy with this set, more so than any other Video Asia product I've bought.  It still wouldn't stop me from buying these films again should a more reputable company like Wild East decide to release better prints.  For now, though, it'll do.",1243209600,52,2361,4.4941176470588236

8309949,5,B001HY3B4K,"Sartana was the closest thing to a rogue James Bond in the spaghetti western genre (Closely followed up by Sabata). Chintzy, cheesy, and ultimately satisfying; having this collected edition is a Grindhouse goldmine!",1509840000,,215,5.545454545454546

8309951,3,B001HY3B4K,"If you haven't seen the Sartana films, do. Now. This set contains the 5 official films, as well as two knockoffs and the film that introduced Gianni Garko as an evil psychopath named Sartana. See my review for LIGHT THE FUSE...SARTANA IS COMING for background on this classic character.

You can find better transfers of the first, third and fifth films fairly easily. This is more of a last resort, this set. Hopefully, somebody will give us a good region one set of all the Sartanas soon.",1401062400,,490,4.632183908045977
8309952,5,B001HY3B4K,"Sartana the Complete Saga has a bunch of Sartana movies on it that tell the tales of the calm, clever, and collective hero known as Sartana. A slick gunfighter that always has the edge, and always a step ahead of the enemy. Sometimes he can do amazing things like magic tricks, and also has stealthy ways to him. Don't try to fool Sartana he will find out the truth. Most prints on this set are decent, and worth it for the value. Sartana is a legend of the spaghetti western era. If you are a collector this non HD set will keep you entertained if you are into these types of westerns from Europe. The original Sartana films are with Gianni Garko, and there is some spin off films included as well.",1400716800,,699,4.303030303030303

8309955,2,B001HY3B4K,"Sure, if you can get this for under $10 it's hard to be angry at what's going on here. Most of the original Sartana are unavailable in other formats and a handful of these titles are literally nowhere else. For that, this set is worth it. For a few of the films, however, there are alternatives. Pricier, but much better, alternatives.

For DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST, check out the absolute steal of Shout/Timeless Media's double feature:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Django-Double-Feature-A-Man-Called-Django-Django-and-Sartana-s-Showdown-in-the-West-Spaghetti-Westerns/dp/B0097L29IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Django!

8309956,3,B001HY3B4K,"A couple of reviews note the correct titles in this collection, but either do so without listing the films in their proper order, or - imo - lacking some necessary clarification.

The bottom line is that the film identified on the box and disc as DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST, is NOT that film, though SHOWDOWN is on the same disc, misidentified as DJANGO VS. SARTANA.

In short, the film identified in this collection as DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST is actually ONE DAMNED DAY AT DAWN... DJANGO MEETS SARTANA, while the film identified as DJANGO VS. SARTANA is actually DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST (aka Django and Sartana are Coming... It's the End).",1362873600,4,691,4.75
