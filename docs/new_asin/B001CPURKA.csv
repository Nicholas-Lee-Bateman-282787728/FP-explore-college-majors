8288566,2,B001CPURKA,"We just got this well made DVD and forwarded to a random spot in the middle.

I would reprimand an employee that called our guests ""folks"" or opened a bottle of wine, without a clean napkin on the table, without the label facing the guest (or off the table with their back facing the guest @ 18:00). It's a cute DVD but we can't use this in our training program.

But this DVD would work for many medium service related venues.

All in all? Worth the money. No doubt.

If we had the technology, we would edit out a few small spots and use it within our training program.

Hope they clean up some small mistakes and lengthen.",1272758400,,624,4.254237288135593
8288567,5,B001CPURKA,"I use this DVD to orientate the new hires at the two restaurant that I own. Just plunk the new-hire down in front of the TV, turn on the movie and viola! They learn all the basic service standards, and also some extra steps they can take REALLY impress the customers! The steps of service are communicated quickly and effectively in a manner that the new generation of employees can relate to. The use of humor in demonstrating what NOT to do also helps to hold their attention. And the Hawaiian setting is fantastic! I tell my staff that I'm sending them on a mini-vacation to Hawaii for hiring on with us. They love it! Over-all, a valuable addition to our training program, and an excellent value!",1243468800,,700,4.519685039370079
