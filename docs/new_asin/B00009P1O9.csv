1887627,5,B00009P1O9,"EXCELSIOR is a dated work . The musical score , by Marenco , is very poor as melodic lines . The plot is old fashioned and naf . But the dance ........ Mainly the dancers .......... How gorgeous they are !!!!
All the soloists are fantastic . Ricardo Massimi are great .
Roberto Bolle are a living sculpture . Only his passages worth buying this DVD !",1203206400,2,350,4.2388059701492535
1887628,4,B00009P1O9,"I think it is fair to say that the performance of Excelsior contained on this DVD will be unlike almost anything that most people have seen previously. While there are elements and steps that will be similar to those found in many well known works, it is the overall effect that has to be seen to be believed. Sometimes the stage has only two dancers, the male in black and the female in white, but at other times there appear to be many, many dozens of performers in brightly colored costumes making intricate maneuvers and formations across the whole stage. Many of the costumes and some of the choreography appear to reflect the era of the ballet's creation and, to this inexperienced eye, take a little getting used to. It reminded me of the `ballet performance' that the Queen and Prince attend in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake.

The whole performance is a little unusual, but also hugely entertaining to watch, helped no doubt by the very tuneful and somehow familiar melodies that accompany the dancing. In some scenes the choreography seems extremely modern and, whether old or modern, the caliber and skill of the soloists is never in question. As a finale to the work, the parading, swinging and dancing with national flags is somewhat reminiscent of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ballet is recommended for those that have seen one too many performances of Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake or Giselle and have an open mind and are looking for something different.",1201132800,6,1482,4.811764705882353
1887629,5,B00009P1O9,"I have seen articles and reviews that disparage the style of the solo dancing in ""Excelsior"" as too modern and/or bland to suit this piece which, despite its dedication to technological and scientific advances that pointed the way to the 20th century, does in fact date from the high Romantic era of the 1880s.  The choreography has also been described as corny and pass, or even racist and reactionary.  These sorts of comments come from seasoned aficionados of classical dance, and while knowledge is a commendable thing, and I don't wish to be associated with ""obscurantism,"" I think that my relative lack of such preconceptions concerning dance allow me to look at ""Excelsior"" with a less jaundiced eye.  All this is my way of saying how much of a delight it was to discover the DVD of this production.

The music certainly caught me by surprise.  The first dance for the female ensemble left me a bit puzzled, as it sounded like something from the soundtrack of an Italian comedy film of the early 1960s, but then seemed to morph into something more akin to Offenbach at times.  The costumes and scenery are delightfully retro in style and struck me as a bit quaint and campy in a fun way.  Though others who have written about the production seem to think they managed to avoid this campy quality for purposes of good taste, I feel that it is there, and intentionally so.  Why spoil something this good with ""good taste?""

And speaking of good taste - Some have decried the old-fashioned ""Orientalism"" in this production, the depiction of Arabs, Turks, Indians, and especially the comic ""Chinaman"" of the Suez Canal scene.  Well, we manage to wink and have a little giggle at the silly costumes and C.B DeMille spectacle aspects of ""Excelsior,"" and I think all that national stereotyping is part and parcel of the piece.  The national stereotypes depicted in this ballet are so cartoonish and ridiculous, I can scarcely believe that anyone takes them seriously enough to take offence.  The ""Ugly American"" has been depicted many times in literature, TV, and films, and is sometimes quite funny.  I wouldn't dream of taking offence at it.  Please, people, reach behind you and remove that stick!

I particularly loved the last scene, a ""ballet of nations"" in which the flags of many different nations are paraded around the stage in intricate formations by high-stepping dancers in national costumes.  Anyone familiar with the finale of the 1930 film ""The King of Jazz,"" where Paul Whiteman presents a great melting pot of national stereotypes in their native costumes, will find this oddly familiar.  It made me both laugh and cry.  The touching naivety of the idea that science and technology was the magic that would finally bring all nations and peoples together in loving harmony is such a sweet and lovely delusion, and it's so heartbreakingly sad that it just isn't so.

I found ""Excelsior"" wonderfully entertaining, and while there is some impressive dancing by the male soloists, it seems to me a particularly good showcase for the strikingly lovely women of La Scala's corps de ballet.  I wish I could take them all home with me (alas, my apartment just isn't big enough).",1139184000,13,3187,4.845018450184502
1887630,5,B00009P1O9,"This is an astounding production. The ballet dancers are superb. Also the music is great. I first viewed Excelsior when Italian television broadcast La Scala's version to North America some time ago. I videotaped it, but I was more than happy when I saw that Amazon offered it on DVD. Any one who purchases this might want to go to the Internet and read what Excelsior is all about before they watch it.

7992216,5,B00009P1O9,"Manzotti's spectacle on the triumph of progress debuted at La Scala in 1881 where and when it was an overwhelming success which toured the world and which has never been totally out of the repertory in Italy. As the only existing example of 19th Century Italian dance it is valuable beyond measure. As an (admittedly a recreation in many parts, and much, much reduced, as here we have only about 100 dancers - as opposed to the original 600) entertainment, we can only regret that times have made an extravaganza like this virtually impossible to stage outside of special occasions.

With colors in keeping with the period, and also using appropriate stage machinery and painted drops, this production is a succession of marvelous precision mass dancing ensembles interspersed with a series of varied pas for the two principle couples (and other equally fine principle dances too). The score, by frequent Manzotti collaborator, Romualdo Marenco is zippy in the extreme with propulsive irresistibly forward moving rhythms and neon orchestration (much diddled with for this production).

Some of the transformations via translucent scrims and drops are gasp inducing, or would be if the idiot television director didn't usually choose to cut away to some dippy close up of an obvious acting gesture at exactly the moment when the major magic is occurring. The changes from the prologue to that sort-of Mt. Olympus, and the one from Volta in his lab to telegraph girls in Washington DC are the most jaw dropping.

The material is illuminating - this is the beginning of art being itself transformed into overt propaganda. 'Progress' is light, and conservatism is darkness, and we all know how that turned out. Isnt it funny (haha) how Utopias always turn into something like our own spiritually, morally and intellectually bankrupt environment? That is something to think about - and that the simplicity of the message is in no ways any simpler than that of our own time, is something else to maybe consider.

That is, if you have the time to think about anything as your eyes and ears are delighted and dazzled by the really fun music, the brilliant decors and the riot of color, fringed costumes and fine, enthusiastic dancing that never stops.

This is hard to find but really worth the effort. This isn't Giselle and it isn't Napoli either, but for what it is, it's near unique and a totally exhilarating experience.

There is another DVD performance of the same production - I think it is on Hardy classics. Well worth checking out as the relentless conquest of Italian Opera and Ballet productions by moron television directors (most of whom are what appear to be the Italian equavilant of equal-opportunity women) was only in its infancy then. In other words the earlier performance has longer takes for the dances.  There should be as close to no cutting in photographing dance as is possible - as Fred Astaire figured out as far back and 1935 - but which the persons who make Ballet videos have not.

Another reason to get the earlier version is that the dancers are all different, all Italian and all very good. Fracci is fine in this earlier performance (and quite nice to look at - she was a very pretty woman) here, not past her prime at all. Also, the actual production is a little different and considerably more elaborate, with more dancers, more costumes, some slightly different sets and even an actual deux ex machina in the last scene to deliver Fracci into the arms of the now freed (and in his spiffy military outfit) slave. That slave, while danced by a very fine, and very famous dancer, is not the gorgeous, gigantic, magnificent and supreme nobile dancer, Roberto Bolle, and while it's not his fault (the earlier guy), when he's romping around near nekked, he's no Bolle, and when he's all gussied up in his gold braid, he's no Bolle either. But then again, nobody else is either, or ever will be, or can be. What a looker!

The Hardy Classic performance does have a flaw - at the point when the lights go down in the DC telegraph scene so that the electric flashes and circles can do their thing...for some reason, they (the lights) never come back up to anywhere near sufficient illumination. Something went seriously wrong in the videotaping. But, if you love Excelsior - and who in the world is stoopid and sour enough to not love it - then get the earlier one too.",1425513600,,4392,4.783641160949868
7992217,4,B00009P1O9,"Ballet from La Scala Milan, The dancing and the entire story line were completely banal. The only thing it had going for it was Roberto Bolle in his prime. Not really worth having. Quick stepping ballet score in conventional tuneful style. Dreadful sets, very second rate stuff indeed. If you are into Roberto Bolle you may stomach this but if not leave it alone. Its The wonderful Bolle and the wonderful Bolle pity his principal ballerina left much to be desired as well..

7992219,5,B00009P1O9,"In addition to Roberto Bolles ...uh hmm .. Rather spectacular asserts he is a rather more than a fine ballet dancer .. This while not the role to examine that dancing for extended periods because his performance is very short, one can see his plush feline grace and beautiful line .. that perfectly aligned fingertip-to-toe tip stretch so vital to classical ballet.  In addition, if you can tear your eyes away, look at his beautifully arched feet, his use of his arms and hands (especially in his pas de tois with Romagna and Massimi compare the two men) his exquisite extension, his lighter than air jumps and landings and his quite formidable flexibility for so large a man.

Also check out Elisabetta Arimato in the ""Arabian dance"".  And as was mentioned in an earlier review the never ending balances of Elisabeth Seabra .. I would recommend buying this from Amazon .. La Scala is in deep trouble and I am sure every penny helps.",1390262400,3,934,4.682926829268292
7992220,5,B00009P1O9,"Interesting to watch old workhorse ballet from the late 19th. century.  Lots of dancing mostly old fashioned and a sign of the times when it was produced lavishly at La Scala with 500 dancers, elephants and who knows what else!.  This is a simplified complete version of the original ballet and as it goes with re-staging works not seen in over 100 years, hard to imaging can be ever close to the original.

7992221,5,B00009P1O9,"This ballet demonstrates that Ballet, a unique art form, can make learning history a fun event.  This ballet, first performed by La Scala Milan in 1881, highlights the scientific advances made in the 19th century, por ejemplo (Arthur is showing off):  the steamboat, the Brooklyn Bridge, opening the Cenisio Tunnel between France and Italy, building the Suez Canal and advances in the discovery of the practical workings of electricity, as demonstrated by the work of Alessandro Volta (voltage is named after him).  Dry stuff, right?  Not as created by Luigi Manzotti with music by Romualdo Marenco.  The ballet is played as a contest between Advancement/Progress, here called ""Light"", danced with vibrancy by a gifted and beautiful Marta Romagna, and Darkness/Backwardness, here called Obscurantism, and danced with matching skills, including fine miming, by Ricardo Massimi.  My favorite Danseur, Roberto Bolle, plays the role of Slave, almost nude.  His female fans may swoon at seeing him so unclad.  The ballet is a spectacle of fabulous sets, lighting and - - - Ladies and Gentlemen:  Come See 100 Beautiful Dancing Girls 100! (Well I didn't really count 'em, but I'm sure the entire Corps de Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala was gainfully employed - and in great form - when this magnificently dressed and staged ballet was performed during La Scala's 2002 Season).  This is a great ballet to use to introduce ballet to people who say:  ""Ballet?  Who needs it.  It's a bore!"")  Well, I can heartily say:  ""Not This One!"". Buy it, make Amazon happy.

7992222,4,B00009P1O9,"Caveat emptor: This 2002 performance was released on DVD by TDK in 2003, and now in 2010 by Arthaus Musik. The Amazon reviews for the earlier release still are relevant.

This ballet spectacle premiered in 1881 and was performed as late as 1916. Its documentation, discovered in 1967, led to its revival in modified form. Critical balletomanes may cry Help! as this italianate Red White Green Sea closes over their hoary heads, but if you're a Normal Person with a big heart, insatiable eyes and ears, and a tough butt, enjoy the show!

Now to unload my personal nitty-gritty: This show was a lot of work and expense, and LaScala applied full resources. Everyone on the roster gets to dance according to his/her level. Some kaleidoscopic dance sequences seem to go  on too long. Many costume changes.

Everybody's Italian, except the London-born conductor, David Coleman, and probably the asst. choreographer. My impression is that some other ballet companies are more inclusive of foreigners.

The music is unashamedly balletic and punchy. You with 5.1 channel sound may go into shock.

THE SOLO ROLES

The character Darkness (also perversely called Obscurantism in the booklet) is powerfully mimed, rather than full-out danced, and is the old-fashioned evil villain. He appears frequently to gloat over momentary crises, or to carry on before the frontdrop while sets are changed.

Light, supremely confident, always defeats him in half a minute. This ballerina can hold those suspenseful balances on pointe to make you marvel.

The ballerina Civilisation is strikingly capable. At one place, she does so many spins on pointe I thought I would heave. She's Roberto Bolle's partner in a series of variations constituting the triumph of the evening. I'm confident she has elected cosmetic dentistry by now.

The ballerinas Thunderbolt and (Subcontinental) Indian each get an eye-catching specialty.

Roberto Bolle is the real reason I bought this DVD, and even back in 2002 he has IT!--the danseur extraordinaire, inner and outer; handsome, honed, trained and dedicated; that natural finesse and uninhibited bravura that guarantee international reputation. In variations, as in Part II, I feel the male body can surpass the female in broader, breath-taking feats (yes, I admit the viewer's sexual orientation may prejudice).

The perfect flow of this huge production is a tribute to the choreographic and directorial beings who planned and drilled all these performances. (Well, one little boy did stumble when filing offstage, but his mother, his instructor, and even I immediately forgave him: indeed, it is the different one who may very well become tomorrow's star.)",1268438400,24,2670,5.2564705882352944
