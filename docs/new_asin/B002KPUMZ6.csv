3943836,4,B002KPUMZ6,"The Series was exactly what I remember, the Shipper's products arrived as it was supposed to. Great Addition to my DVD wall",1260057600,,123,4.636363636363637
3943837,2,B002KPUMZ6,"If you like the original Japanese then this only has dubtitles (i.e. the subtitles are for the English adaptation which do not always match the original). And if you like the English dub, the final scene (after the credits) in the final episode is only in Japanese even though it was broadcast in English. Whoever did the DVDs likely treated this final scene like the previews after each episode which are also only in Japanese.

So we have a high priced item, especially considering that prices have come down in the Anime market, and they didn't even do a good job on it. And so far there is no word if Sony will allow us to exchange the final disk for one that gets the English dub correct. So I'm dinging them for it. If they do respond favorably I will create a new review with a better rating.

The series itself of course is really good, it's just too bad Sony didn't put more effort into a decent DVD boxed set. My advice for now is to wait till the price comes down or you can find it on sale.

Update 2009-11-10: Word is that Sony will *not* be addressing the English dub issue in the final scene of the series, so my two-star review stands. :-(",1257379200,65,1155,4.2889908256880735
3943838,4,B002KPUMZ6,"well, finaly they release the 2nd part of blood+, my fave anime, but i think that they were in a hurry to get it done, while overall it is good, there were a few things that dod bother me, 1. they left the previews and the final part of the final episode in japanese with english subs, while i have no problem with watching it that way, i kinda just would have liked to see it in english as well, 2. i dunno if it was just me, but when i had to change the language to enlgish and turn subs off, again no problem watching it in japanese but its just the way i watch it the 1st time, and there seemed to be long pauses at the begining of each episode and after break, unless it was just me, also the interviews are kinda messed up, the translator (sp?) seems boring and i don't think he is translating everything right and also, this is the 2nd part, so why do some of the questions seem like they dunno about 2nd part at all, well if you love blood+ you should get this for sure, but they are a few minor problems to those who want their anime expierence to be perfect, like me

like i said, it seems they were in kind of a hurry to get it out

and one last thing, they labeled the final episode name wrong, yes it is correct in the english translation, but the true name is Nan-kuru-nai-sah",1256774400,16,1290,4.03515625
3943839,5,B002KPUMZ6,"If you have seen the first half then this is a must see.
 Many questions are answered..Who the Schiff are and how they came about. Why Saya was killing everybody in Vietnam 30 years ago. What was the promise Haji made to Saya. As with the first half of the series the music(execellent) makes the mood and the animation remains true from start to finish of the series. There are twists to keep interested. This half takes you to Paris,London and New York on Saya's quest to kill Diva. I will not tell you what happens as you need to see it for yourself. I hate reading reviews that give away to much of the story. There is no real nudity/fan service and next to zero foul language. Fight scenes are great and still a far amount of Blood.
 This is the same style box set as the fist half. You get a total of 5 DVD's (full screen format) in 3 thin-pak DVD's-one on each side. Also you get Manga sampler and a knit hat,instead of a T-Shirt. Extras..only on disc 5 which is interviews and a few previews of Live Action movies. When you watch the Writer/Director interview you get the feeling that he wants to do more of Blood +.
 Even though it is rather expensive I highly recommend this entire series.
  In the product discription it says ""Languages-JAPANESE"" I ordered from AMAZON and mine has both ENGLISH & JAPANESE and as far as the subtitles I had English and French(did not check the French). When it comes to the subtitles the English version is pretty much word for word with the voice overs. Also there are still no English credits as was the first half....for me all those things are minor...still an Excellent show!!",1256601600,12,1624,4.436241610738255
3943840,5,B002KPUMZ6,"I first want to clear something up, this second half (episodes 26-50) of Blood+ is in English and/or Japanese. There was a comment left giving 3 stars bashing the Japanese producers and crying about how it's only available in the Japanese language. This is not true so if you're holding back on buying this because of that you are being misled. This last half is awesome and comes with a beanie cap and a small booklet. The sound is in stereo only like the first half and the picture is in full screen as well.

The beany cap that comes with it is pretty sweet even for somebody like me.

So 5 stars all the way. An absolutely must have to finalize your Blood+ craving.",1256256000,4,669,4.344
3943841,5,B002KPUMZ6,"I love this series and have been waiting patiently for them to release the second part. This is an awesome series but most of the best episodes are in the second part of the series as we get to see some of the history between Saya and Haji as well as the history of Diva. You also get to see the growth of characters like Kai, Maio(hope I spelled that right),David, Julia, and the reporter who's name escape me at the moment. The whole series comes to a close that's all at once sad but beautiful at the same time. I CAN'T WAIT TO FINALLY OWN THE WHOLE SERIES!!!!",1253750400,,563,4.174311926605505
3943842,5,B002KPUMZ6,"I was beginning to think that the second half of the Blood+ series wasn't going to come out.  For a moment (more like months) my thoughts were WTF happened to Blood+: Part Two, how long does a guy have to wait for one of the best vampire anime series in the history of anime to come out already.  Where was I going with this review again... oh yeah! long story short like the person before stated if you purchased the first half of the Blood+ series, or the individual 5 volumes released then part two is a must have to complete this remarkable series.",1252627200,2,552,4.298076923076923

If you watched Blood+ on adult swim and own part one(and have been waiting VERY PATIENTLY as I have for part 2)then you don't really need a review. This is episodes 26-50, FINALLY (SONY). I think this is definatly the better part of the series. It's darker, we meet the schiff, oh.. what happens to Riku is sad, and we really see how cruel Diva can be before being made to almost feel sorry for her. And we also see just how loyal Solomon is to Diva, not, loved it. The fight between Amshel and Haji is not to be missed. But the Final battle of the ""two queens"", As Nathan would say, Superb, Bravo. This has been too long a wait, I will be counting down the days till oct. 20th.

3943851,5,B002KPUMZ6,"I remember seeing this series for the first time on adult swim, in 2008 I think it was...and I was instantly hooked from the first episode! I've felt more emotions with this animated show, than I feel watching movies with real actors. I don't like a lot of anime, but I do like it. Especially the shows I've seen. The summary of the story/plot is basically this: a girl who appears to look no older than a 16 year old, who simply goes by the name Saya, has been adopted into a family, after awakening from a 30 year slumber. She appears to be a normal human girl, in other words, she ""fits in"" when her foster father, is connected with an undercover investigation group known as: 'the red shield', who specifically hunt cryptic, vampire-like creatures. As the story proceeds further, she soon begins to discover her connection to the blood suckers, & unravel everything about her past, present, and future. She is the only weapon in the world who can wipe the creatures called ""chiropterans"" into extinction, and you will find out why.

Each small case has cool artwork and the images on the discs are intruiging. The covers of the cases are also nice. There are five episodes on each disc. The package also came with a beanie that I absolutely love! There are a few small issues, but nothing big enough to make me unhappy. There are very short pauses in between scenes when watching English dub, and the previews for the next episodes are in Japanese with the English subtitles. Sometimes the subtitles are a little different as well, when watching in English with the subs on, but it usually isn't too different. These are all minor issues that aren't too bothersome. Everything else was great! I was really happy to get so much for such a cheap price, when I usually get only a few episodes for the same price.

3943874,5,B002KPUMZ6,"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~

Saya Otanashi is so far just an amnesiac teenage girl. Yet, behind the surface she comes to discover in an event that will change her life forever that she isn't human at all. Saya is a member of chiropracterans (vampires but like the type you'd never expect at all, way freakier). Thse chiropterans live on blood and murder humans. She's also one of the few of her species. She alone can destroy these ugly monsters. Her blood contains amazing attributes that eventually destroy them. Saya must for the most part throughout struggle to recall her origins along with her very attractive protector Haji. Who I should say is bound to her most of the time. Nobody is willing who knows of what Saya is capable to tell her because as you soon realize is a closely guarded secret for a reason. That's until, BAM!, we are introduced to Diva. Diva is Saya's sister. She couldn't not be bothered. What she reveals to Saya and not at all gently turns Saya's world into a void of uncertainty. Saya somehow finds the strength to get over her past which is very turbulent. As we travel with Saya in the series, her adoptive human family, also make themselves available to assist her in destroying the chiropterans that are very bloodthirsty. Blood + has some of the most appealing animation I have witnessed. Contains the best drama which includes plot twists just so you know. In short an amazing anime watch that fans of anime with a taste of Science Fiction will love forever. Recommend so much!

3943875,5,B002KPUMZ6,"I can honestly say that Blood+ Part II is among my favorite anime ever, just behind Wolf's Rain. I bought both Part I & II back in 2009 and just never got around to writing review, but there's no time like the present so here goes!!! For the sake of time and my sanity, I'm going to assume that everyone has seen Part I. If you haven't seen it yet and need a good review, E.A. Solinas wrote a great one under the Part I Box Set page here on Amazon.

In Part II, we see a new version of Saya, resigned to her fate and a series that is obviously racing towards its climax. Whereas sometimes Part I seemed a bit ponderous, most of Part II (with the exception of a couple of episodes) is packed with more battles, intrigue, secrets you won't even see coming, betrayal, blood, and thankfully MUCH less Kai (seriously if I had to hear that boy scream ""SAAAAYYYYAAA one more time it was not going to end well for him, even if he is just a cartoon). All the secrets and conspiracies of the first 26 episodes begin to be answered and a whole slew of newer and much crazier secrets and conspiracies arise to take their place. This isn't a show that ends with a lot of unanswered questions. You may not like the answers to the questions, or you may find the way they get to the answers completely confusing, but at least you don't feel cheated. Less like Lost and more like the X Files when that show was good.

Part II is all about confrontations... Saya and Diva, Haji and Amshel, Haji and Solomon, David and himself, the Schiff vs. Diva and her Chevaliers... and best of all - the confrontation between Saya and Haji. Confrontation is the core of this season - confronting your demons and putting the past behind you so that you can live in the present. Let me tell ya, without trying to spoil your dinner with too much dessert, the Haji/Solomon, Haji/Amshel & Saya/Haji confrontations are worth the price of the box set. Seriously.

As for the DVDs, yes, Sony rushed them. The extras are minimal at best. There are interviews but only with the Japanese cast and crew which is interesting, but the English dub on this anime is really great for the most part. A lot of these English actors also worked on anime like Ghost in the Shell and Wolf's Rain. The subtitles are a direct English translation, which is lazy in my opinion. And yes, the final scene after the credits is only in Japanese. Lazy, but thank heaven they included it at all.

The music is great. Diva's theme is outstanding. It reminds me a bit of that aria from The Fifth Element. My favorite of the themes is the opening from season 2 (there are 4 seasons even though there are only 2 box sets). This is one of two sound tracks that I own - the other being both sound tracks by Yoko Kanno for Wolf's Rain.

So, to sum up, in my opinion Blood+ is a fantastic anime and more than worth your time. Part II is much more intense than Part I. It's a very well balanced show. It's a great action show, a great love story, beautiful animation, pretty well written, and beautiful music. My complaints are: that I'd like a real English subtitle track; I wish they'd fix the final scene so that it's in English; since the series was so popular, I'd like to see some really good extras aimed at the American market; and last but not least, despite the bluray controversy, I'd really like to see it on bluray since Sony owns both the series and the technology.

*** One last note on the Blood+ series***

  If you haven't seen it and you're considering buying it without watching it, I suggest getting a free trial to Netflix first. It's part of their streaming service if you're a member. You get like 10 days with your free trial. Hopefully, you'll be able to get far enough into the series to figure out if you really want it or not because buying the box sets for both Blood+ I & II is really expensive. Trust me.

Hope my review helps! :)",1302307200,6,3889,4.329670329670329
3943876,5,B002KPUMZ6,"If you own Blood + part one. The first 25 episodes left me wanting more out of Saya. When I say more I mean a stronger, more tough character. One that could hold her own. In part two, I was quite happy to see how Saya's character had transformed into a fighting machine. Even her little girl school outfit changes into some thing more kwel. I would definitely recommend part two the last 25 episodes. The ending is a little strange but it is an ending.

When it aired on Adult Swim, I saw the first episode and was not impressed with it.  Later flipping through channels one night I caught an episode that was much later in the series and the show had really become interesting.

8372180,3,B002KPUMZ6,"Saya's younger foster brother Riku survives the attack from the queen of chiropterans Diva whom is none other than Saya's younger sister. Barely surviving the battle herself, Saya regroups on the flagship of the organization called the Red Shield whose mission is to exterminate chiropterans and to kill Diva. Things become more complicated when another faction joins the fray seeking Saya's blood, and Diva's bigger plan comes to light. -summary

Blood+ Part Two contains the last 25 episodes out of 50 of Blood+. This second story arc continues to stick with the formula found in the first arc, which is far more drama than action; and like the previous arc it features side stories and characters galore. It also runs into the same problem as the previous arc by trying to accurately juggle all these things without giving off an incoherent feel. Everything does work out and make sense by the end, but due to the pacing issues, and certain characters who seriously just needed to go away, numerous times I found myself pretty bored and impatiently waiting for this story to end.

The plot follows Saya and her servant Hagi as they seek to confront and kill Diva putting an end to the Chiropteran menace. Along the way new alliances are formed, characters are killed off, and sides are switched. Everything soon leads into a huge showdown between the groups with the fate of the world at stake.

Blood+ focuses heavily on drama and its characters, and it works out here most of the time since a majority of the characters are very well written, possessing plenty of potential for drama which makes them into believable people. Their drives are very realistic and I enjoyed how this worked into the main story, providing an ample amount of suspense and plot twist. It's quite amazing how this large list of characters were developed well enough. One can easily find themselves attached to many, and very concerned on where their chosen paths take them. The character interactions have moments, very, very, good moments of excitement and intrigue, and this also plays very well into the ending. Blood+ definitely ends on a strong note making the trip somewhat worth it.

Now the rest of the anime is a mixed bag at best, since it does suffer from some pacing issues. There are way too many side plots taking place, and finding time for all these events and character interactions were sometimes distracting. I think several characters and situations could have been left on the cutting room floor, and this would have helped the story move a lot more fluid. I understand that a lot of these things played into Saya's character development, but this was one of those cases of too much character development, and as a result, it gave away Saya's actions in the final cut. The foreshadowing was so strong to the point where it heavily took away from the ""deciding moment"". I praised the series for its use of drama, however, due to the obvious I felt that a certain dramatic moment wasn't as strong as it should have been. In addition, some of these elements began to repeat themselves over and over as if the point wasn't made clear the first couple of times.

Even though the drama and characters are the main focus, there's plenty of action to be found here, and the scenes are still violent and brutal with lots of sword play resulting in dismemberments. The battles are a welcome treat no doubt. However, they can also be the series weakness. There are too many confrontations that ends with both sides withdrawing, and eventually I got sick and tired of seeing the same faces battling over and over. On the plus side, at least the battles had a point, and they delivered small parts of the story that would either play into the big picture or tie up side stories. Still though, after awhile they began to bore me. One thing about the battles that really annoyed me was Saya. As a lead protagonist when concerning her skill in battle, I didn't like her as much as I wanted to. Her weakness reminded me too much of Miyu from Vampire Princess Miyu, a very weak character who always relied on her servant. I need my heroes to be strong, and I need them to hold their own in battle. It's fine to come away from battle scathed, but I have an issue when the hero appears to be weaker than everyone.

The production values are still outstanding with some amazing visuals. There are some very beautiful backgrounds, and the night time and sunsets are simply gorgeous. There are some very nice character designs, and some of the more powerful chiropterans have freakish appearances. The animation during the battles are very good with nice choreography. Unfortunately, there are various shortcuts taken straight out of Dragonball Z, with the super speed and unseen action garbage and I didn't like that at all. The soundtrack is still nice, but the songs are the same ones found in the previous arc which are made up of piano laden backgrounds and synthesized scores.

Blood+ could have been an amazing anime. It's far from a bad title, and it heavily makes up for the original movie. However, due to several issues in the storyline it just comes off as an average title. I've seen far better in the action/drama genre. There are plenty of other action filled series out there to choose from. I only recommend this to serious anime fans.

Pros: Ending, production values, some interesting characters

Cons: Pacing issues that bogs down the middle portion",1451260800,,5448,4.750528541226216
