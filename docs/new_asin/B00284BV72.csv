8355659,5,B00284BV72,"This dvd is a straight forward excellent math class provided in short, easy to grasp lessons.  We use it for grades 7-8 algebra.  We have pretty advanced standards though, and I believe the lessons on this dvd  do extend to grades 9-10  and cover some advanced algebra.  The teacher is clear and explains like a perfect teacher.  We use this before or after doing the same or similar concept in our text books.  My kids really like this dvd.",1438905600,,441,4.506329113924051
