6426546,5,B00KH57U6K,"I love this box set because it shows the final battle between Ichigo & Aizen, a truly Epic Battle even though it's not very long. Before you get to the main event, the first episode is a Halloween special, which is fitting considering it's October. After the main event it goes on to show many other episodes that do not start a new chapter, some are not bad, but others are just weird. Anyone who has watched or collected the Series so far knows what I mean.",1412553600,,459,4.287356321839081
6426547,4,B00KH57U6K,"If you have been following the series, you'll likely already know that this sums up the Aizen Arc that has been going on since the first season (technically). As much as I love this series, and as much as I've waited to see the Aizen Arc's conclusion, I feel the action was a bit of a let down. The first disc in this 2 disc set has conclusion of the fight with Ichigo and Aizen, the second disc has a bunch of filler and has nothing to do with the story Arc, The fight itself is really pretty short, and for a 300 episode build up, I just didn't feel like I got the closure I wanted. I think if the action had been spread out over more than just one disc, I would have liked it a little better. For the finale, I was expecting maybe 1 filler episode and 12 high octane action packed episodes, what I got instead was 1 episode of high octane fighting, 3 episodes of plot revelations, 2 buildup episodes, and 7 post-Arc filler episodes. There are some major plot developments that do get resolved in this set, but on the whole, I was pretty disappointed with the conclusion of the main story line thus far. That isn't to say that this isn't a great set to own. In fact, it is one of the best seasons of the show in terms of good episodes. However it just didn't live up to my expectations as a conclusion of a main story line. I won't go into too much detail as not to spoil any of the episodes.

Where the first season had that sort of feeling of the unknown where the characters had limited power, this set has an overwhelming feeling of omnipotence with the main characters. This sets up the god vs god type of fight we see in Ichigo and Aizen for the final confrontation. This fight alone makes all the other trials seem pretty insignificant by comparison. It fits the timeline, but it also nerfs the rest of the whole series by a huge margin, almost as if to say that none of the other fights meant anything at all. The power levels of Ichigo and Aizen in this set are so far advanced that they don't come close to comparison even Ichigo's total hollow power seems insignificant. Depending on your point of view, this may be a good thing or a bad thing.

There is the same attention to detail with sound quality, art and art style. The box itself is almost identical to the sets released just after the Bount Arc; plastic multi DVD case without many extras. There aren't any new actors, and the only new characters are really just new forms of existing characters. There isn't anything that should surprise any fan that has watched all the previous episodes, we all knew this encounter was coming. In a show for me that is a 5 star show, this is a less than average set at 4 stars. But even a less than average set for the whole series is still a 4 star set on its own.

If you are considering buying this or not, let's be realistic here. If you've devoted time to watch all the other episodes, it wouldn't matter if this was the worst set of the entire series, you'd still probably get it. For collection's sake alone, this is a worth while purchase. I just consider it a bonus that the episodes are pretty decent too. While I was personally disappointed with the way the Arc ended, it does end smoothly and without a hitch. This is a must for a collector, and a pretty good buy for an average fan too.",1412121600,9,3307,4.254372019077901

6426551,5,B00KH57U6K,"I haven't gotten the Box Set yet, but I've watched the whole 366 episodes of the Bleach series and this box set contains, what is essentially the Pinnacle battle for the WHOLE SERIES!  The Main Character, Ichigo Kurosaki achieves ultimate power as does the main villain of the series S. Aizen.  It has been a long time coming, but I was not disappointed!  The battle between Kurosaki and Aizen is truly epic!  The story 'arches' after the battles in Episodes 307-309, are all anti-climatic in my opinion.  This box set is a must have for any Bleach fan!",1406764800,24,553,4.6020408163265305

6426585,5,B00KH57U6K,"The end of the Aizen saga. Its pretty good. Aizen thinks he's so badass, but Ichigo surpasses him as a transcendent being, that's cool to see, unfortunately he loses his spiritual powers as a result. Ichigo's final form is pretty rad looking. I would have liked to see more of him in this form. I have 3 more sets to get to complete the collection. It irritates me that VIZ originally released the seasons in larger box sets, but then scaled down to smaller sets with only 12 episodes. I guess from a business point of view it was prudent, but definitely bad for fanservice. after I complete the anime collection, I will move on to the manga to continue the story line.",1456790400,4,669,4.4471544715447155
