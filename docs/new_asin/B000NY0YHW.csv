8182278,5,B000NY0YHW,"Got this DVD in 2007 for our son, then 3. Basically more for the toy that came with it (I believe this character is called ""Jack"") then for the DVD itslef. At the same time we also got him one of the Thomas playsets. It was the introduction to Thomas and Friends toys for him. At the time he wasn't much interested in the DVD. But he played a lot with Jack (still does) together with the ohter trains he got with the set. It wasn't until about one year later that he actually started to watch the DVD. The movie he used to watch a lot prior to that was Cars from Pixar (still one of his favorites). When he did start watching Thomas Thrusty Friends, he liked it a lot. He watches it, and then wants to play with his Thomas playsets. He wants to keep the DVD playing when he's playing with the set. From this DVD he learned a the names of Thoams friends.

Now most of the times he watches Hero of the Rails, but occasionally he ask to watch Thomas Thrusty Friends.",1276041600,4,1169,4.85

8182281,5,B000NY0YHW,My grandson enjoyed viewing this. It explains on a juvenile level that though we may be different it is something to be celebrated.,1198800000,,131,4.739130434782608
8182282,5,B000NY0YHW,"My son used to be obsessed with Thomas, but now he loves to go to construction sites to watch the big machines dig, so this DVD is perfect.  Like ""On Site with Thomas"", this DVD features Thomas, and Miss Jenny's pack:  Jack the front loader, Alfie the excavator, Byron the bulldozer, Buster the steam roller, Ned the steam shovel, Max and Monty the dump trucks, and others.  His only criticism of this DVD is that it comes to an end.
