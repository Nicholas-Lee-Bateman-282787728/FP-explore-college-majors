723493,4,630386483X,"These are all good westerns, but there are many issues with the prints used.  Marshall of Gunsmoke has a lot of minor print damage and could be about a minute short.  No Universal logo and the title card has been replaced with the Commonwealth re-issue card.  End title is ok.  Oklahoma Raiders is worse.  Besides the usual print damage there is one dialogue splice.  The worst part is that every reference to Universal has been removed.  The opening title card has been replaced with one that has no id as to who re-issued this film.  Even the end title was replaced with a generic one.  Arizona Days has fared better.  The print is decent with one spot where the picture froze for a second(may have been a layer change).  Sources indicate different running times, so it is hard to be sure about that.  The Grand National logo is intact.  Trouble in Texas is missing the opening Grand National logo, but continues with the original credits.  Print quality is acceptable, but there are many minor splices during dialogue.  There is a better print available that is without all the splices and is two minutes longer.  It is also not as dark as the VCI print and is much easier on the eyes.  It is on a set titled ""Rita"" from Image Ent.  The bad news is that this is a 1940's re-issue where the ENTIRE opening credits have been replaced in order to give Rita Hayworth top billing.  All VCI had to do was put the original credits onto the body of this other edition.  If they are not willing to do something as simple as that, I question their supposed dedication to classic film.",1356566400,4,1577,4.485915492957746
723494,2,630386483X,"Arizona Days, 1937 film

The story begins with two riders on the road. Tex sings about Tombstone Arizona. An arbitrary critter? The sheriff wants to collect from McGill for unpaid bills. Tex pays, and joins the show. Grass plays a trombone like you never heard before. Eight men go in without paying. Grass introduces the singer. Tex has a surprise for the audience! He collects the price of admission. Next we see Tex collecting taxes in a new way. Later Tex sings about a trail. A shot is fired and hits Billy. People are warned, the tax collector is in town.

Tex collects from Price and gives him a receipt. Now he has to bring the cash back to Tombstone. Price and his men ambush Tex and Grass. Many shots are fired. Grass returns for help. Tex plays dead, then surprises the gang who finds straw instead of cash. There is a fist fight. Price and his gang leave just before the posse arrives. There is a chase and a final fight. The tax money was saved. There is a final song while Tex and his bride ride along the road.

This is just an average movie. The version I saw had some scenes chopped out, which detracts from the story.",1293580800,,1135,4.369668246445498

723498,5,630386483X,"Grand National presents ""ARIZONA DAYS"" (30 January 1937) (57 mins/B&W) -- Tex Ritter was an American country singer and actor --- From his very first film in 1936 through some of his best loved singing Westerns of the mid '40s, he gave the American public some of the best B-Westerns of that era --- Ritter also worked on various radio programs --- In 1932, he starred on the WOR Radio show The Lone Star Rangers, which was New York's first broadcast western --- He sang songs and told tales of the Old West --- Ritter wrote and starred in Cowboy Tom's Roundup on WINS Radio in New York in 1933 --- This daily children's cowboy radio program aired over three stations on the East Coast for three years --- These shows marked the beginning of Ritter's popularity in radio, which paved the way for his upcoming singing career --- He also performed on the radio show WHN ""Barndance"" and sang on NBC Radio --- He appeared in several radio dramas, including CBS's ""Bobby Benson's Adventures"" and ""Death Valley Days"".

Ritter began recording for American Record Company (Columbia Records) in 1933 --- His first released recording was ""Goodbye Ole Paint."", also recorded ""Rye Whiskey"" at that label.

Our story line and plot, Tex Malinson (Tex Ritter) and sidekick Grass (Syd Saylor) join McGill's (William Faversham) traveling show --- When Price (Forrest Taylor) has McGill's wagons burned, Tex becomes the county tax collector to earn money --- This leads to trouble as one of those owing money is Price who says he will not pay --- As a studio Grand National Pictures only lasted for a couple of years -- Seeing what success Republic had with Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, they signed Tex Ritter from The Grand Old Opry as their singing cowboy --- The production values aren't as good as Republic oaters, but very original within the framework of B-Westerns --- One thing that was original with Arizona Days, Tex took on the job of tax collector for the Tombstone Arizona area -- That has to be unique in the annals of western films -- Imagine outlaws who not only rob, pillage and kill, but don't file their 1040s -- Ritter sings a couple of nice songs and the taxes do get collected -- Something unheard of in western films is the up front killing of a child, the kid brother of Eleanor Stewart who Tex is courting -- Tommy Bupp (Billy Workman) is killed when the outlaws ambush Tex and Eleanor and miss Tex, but kill young Tommy -- Don't how that one got through the censors of 1937.

723500,5,630386483X,"VCI Entertainment gives us a fine DVD release of four of the better and more representative little B Westerns that the legendary Tex Ritter made in the 1930s and 1940s. As usual, VCI has found good prints for its release. At the very reasonable price for these four movies, no one should be disappointed. Two of Ritter's Universal-released oaters are included, as are two earlier vehicles. No one with an interest in classic B Westerns should be disappointed. Ritter, of course, includes several musical numbers in each production; after all, he had one of the finest voices around. But these little films are not musicals, but rough-and-ready shoot-'em ups, bound to please the most discriminating Western fan.

723501,4,630386483X,"This Grand National release from 1937 is a little bit different from your usual Tex Ritter B-western. In Arizona Days, Tex departs from the normal cowboy life, isn't a marshal of some sorts in disguise, and he doesn't even wind up in jail for a crime he didn't commit. Tex Malison (Ritter) is tired of chasing dogies all over the range; he would rather sing, and he gets a chance to do just that when he bails out Professor McGill's traveling minstrel show of its debts. When a bunch of ornery cowpokes sneak into the first show in Tombstone, Ritter adds a little something special to his repertoire - and makes some enemies in the process of Harry Price (Forrest Taylor) and his thugs. Before you can say Wild Bill Hickock, the show's wagons are burning. It doesn't really take a genius to figure out who was behind the fire, and Tex sets out to save the show and bring the bad guys to justice. He lands a job as, of all things, a tax collector; the money's good, the job pits him against Price and his tax-evading fellows, and he gets to stay on the Workman ranch in close proximity to Marjorie Workman (Eleanor Stewart) - and Tex especially likes the sound of that. Price's gang doesn't take kindly to Tex's new duties, and that means trouble is a brewing.

Arizona Days is a pretty good film featuring a number of Tex Ritter songs. Salty Holmes' unusual harmonica-playing doesn't do much for me, though. Syd Saylor tags along as Tex's sidekick Claude ""Grass"" Hopper, but he doesn't serve much of a purpose apart from his funny name. Then there's young Billy Workman, a slightly problematic piece in the film's puzzle. In the end, Arizona Days is nothing all that special, but it is a little different, and that makes it an interesting and enjoyable Tex Ritter classic.",1107129600,,1772,4.572327044025157
