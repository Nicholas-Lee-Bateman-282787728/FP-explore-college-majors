5312619,5,B009B82G2W,"Level E is a smart, fun, twisted anime. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, my only regret is that it isn't longer! I have watched it in both the Japanese and the English, and I have to say Vic's Baka is brilliant. SO MANY VOICES.",1356739200,7,228,4.204545454545454
5312620,5,B009B82G2W,"If you've been to any of his con appearances lately, chances are you've heard about Level E, his newest voice acting role. I attended AWA 2012 and as soon as I had internet access I preordered this series. It is absolutely HILARIOUS! Prince Baka is all over the place doing crazy things and sometimes even having crazy mood swings. Even though it's a very short series (only 13 episodes), I would definitely reccommend it to everyone.",1356048000,7,434,4.723684210526316
5312621,4,B009B82G2W,"Tsutsui Yukitaka is a high school freshman living on his own. Or at least he thought he would be on his own. When he arrived at his new apartment, he finds it occupied - by a young man claiming to have amnesia... and to be an alien. Should Yukitaka believe him - on either count?

Level E is a short series from the author of Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter, but it is quite different from his big hits. It works out as a series of short stories, around 2-3 episodes in length (the series is 13 episodes total). The main character is quite probably insane, but lots of fun to watch. I've read the manga and watched the anime. The manga has a bit more of a horror aspect, while the anime is almost pure comedy, but the stories are the same (as far as I remember).

5312653,4,B009B82G2W,"and the humor is good, but suffers, like a number of other anime titles, due to the 13 episode format. If it had the full 24-26 episode format in which to really develop the characters and allow the writers to have fun within the arc, the show would outrageously funny. And with more character developing (mainly Prince Baka) the ending, decent as it is, would be that more satisfactory.
Over all, I'm glad to have it in my collection.",1401840000,,435,4.518987341772152
5312654,5,B009B82G2W,"...but Level E delivers an excellent blend of humor, intrigue, intellectual/moral provocation, introspection, and good old wantonly hilarious deconstruction of classic tropes any Japan-exposed child of the '80s-'00s will be at least passingly familiar with.  This series definitely makes my short-list, and even the dubbing (for those so inclined) seems well-done and loses very little of the charm and character of the subs I was first exposed to (the same cannot be said of the painfully long and unskippable plug for an English dub of Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka at the start of the disc).",1387238400,,587,5.114583333333333

5312658,5,B009B82G2W,"My 16 year-old daughter, who bought the series, wrote the following review:

Honestly, I really enjoyed Level E. It's very hard not to spoil the series and explain the plot, so don't try to look it up online. Let me tell you that it's about aliens, and the Baka(the main character; the blondie) is very witty and clever. He really makes the series. I also really enjoyed Vic Mignogna's performance. He really made the character seem alive, despite the emotionless animation. Let me sum up with:

Pros:
+ Excellent Voice Casting (Both the Japanese & the English)
+ Witty Plot
+ Medium-Short Length
+ Extremely Original
+ Blu-Ray Combo Pack (I really like combo packs)

Cons:
- Ending (I didn't like it, but that's just my opinion.)
- Not Enough Baka

Overall, I absolutely loved this series! If some more excitement could build up, I really think this could be the next Ouran Highschool Host Club (or something like that).",1368057600,,921,4.7375
5312659,4,B009B82G2W,over the last two years I became an anime fan and this one is a odd tale but is really good I have bought some I would only watch once but this one will be in my circle of re-watch again and again,1364083200,,196,3.5813953488372094
5312660,5,B009B82G2W,"The storyline really was consistant, didn't seem to be at times, but it was.  The visual styles were all over the place (kind of like the main character).  I loved it!  Especially the twists and turns at the end.  It's now in my rotation of series to rewatch.",1363564800,,259,4.333333333333333
5312661,3,B009B82G2W,"I love this anime.  It's witty and beautifully drawn, and I watched it when it was simulcast on Crunchyroll.  I was so happy to hear that it was going to be available in the US.  We bought it, and watched the dubbed version.  As with all anime, if you've watched the subtitled version, it takes a while to get used to the new voices in the dubbed version.  And things were going well, until we got to my favorite arc, the Color Rangers.  In the original, the kids were funny and quick, with great buddy-type repartee.  In the dubbed version, they sounded stupid.  It was so disappointing.  I also found, as the dubbed series wore on, that Prince Baka's hilarious weirdness was considerably diminished in comparison to the original.  Whomever worked on the script for the dub took considerable license with the original script.  Because I can watch either version with this set, I'm still very pleased to own it.",1356912000,2,911,4.63125
8539243,3,B009B82G2W,"Not really what I thought it would be.... especially considering how the first episode went.
It was kinda like it did a 180.

There are some humorous aspect to it and I kinda learned not to take the show seriously especially considering that the show is aware of it's own humor and kinda poking fun at itself in some aspects.

Overall I guess it's different enough that I would say I'm glad I watched just for the experience of something different than same old stuff.",1511395200,,468,4.4941176470588236

8539245,5,B009B82G2W,"- Synopsis: A tale of an alien genius that treats Earth like his own source of comedy. This alien just loves pranking humans and watching their expressions from his pranks. Not only that, this anime also alludes to many shows, video games, and superhero that many viewers grew up with. A nostalgic anime that hits close to home for many anime viewers. Tune in to see the whacky adventures of one of the biggest trolls to come to planet Earth.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Hilarious anime. Nice and inexpensive. Interesting coexistence between alien species and humans. One of the main characters, Baka, is a huge troll. Very fun watching him mess with others, whether intentional or accidental. He's just a born/natural troll. I wonder if you can become a certified troll.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 13 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for some language and suggestive scenes.

- Conclusions: If you want to relax and have some laughs with an old-school-like anime, go ahead and give this one a try. Great to enjoy with friends too. This anime is a nice break from most animes that are out there. I guess you really can't beat a classic. There's just some nostalgia to them that make them very enticing. As well, as being refreshing, which adds to the entertainment factor.

8539246,4,B009B82G2W,"The first thing I'd like to address are a few misconceptionseconds.  Some have complained this series isn't long enough, that it should have been 26 episodes to flesh out the characters.. this is just nonsense.  This anime is an adaption of a 16 chapter manga written in 1995 by Togashi Yoshihiro, creator of Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter X Hunter.  16 chapters of a comic at approximately 20 pages each is a short read.  This is something you can read in under an hour.  Many anime adoptions of manga stick to a 2-3 chapters per episode format.  The fact that this series can even be 13 episodes is impressive as it could have easily been adapted in 5-6 episodes or even just a movie.  This is Togashi, legendary mangaka.  No one would go back and rewrite his series just to make it longer as an anime.

Secondly, the dubbing is terrible.  I understand so many Americans seem to think Victoria Mignogna is God's gift to anime, but he's just awful.  He comes across as a manic middle aged man with multiple personality disorder rather than the genius intellect perennial prankster/borderline sociopath that he is.

While I would highly discourage the English dub, I can't recommend the Japanese version more.  The series is clever, interesting, engrossing and hilarious.  It's a shame that the Amazon product description is essentially a massive spoiler to the first 3 episodes of the series.",1473120000,,1387,4.773109243697479

It was done very well, the story always stayed fresh and I could never really see the twists that it continued to throw out, and the voice work is some of the best I have ever heard in an anime.
