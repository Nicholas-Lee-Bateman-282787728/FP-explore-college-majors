2204969,5,B00078MDB4,These programs are great! Just wait for used ones to come along for a reasonable price and you won't be disappointed. I have volumes 1-6 and love them!,1178841600,4,151,4.428571428571429
2204970,1,B00078MDB4,"A great 50's show, perhaps the prototye for ""The 70's Show"", a series with the TV's most beautiful golddigging goddess Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld), Maynard G Krebs (""Work!"" Bob Denver, aka Gilligan), clothes-hound Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty), dwarfish Zelda Gilroy (propinquity) and let's not forget the rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr (Family motto ""Never dip into Capital"").

However for $18+ you get only 2 twenty-five minute (without commercials) episodes. Poor quality print.

Poor value for the money.",1151280000,14,510,5.697368421052632
2204971,5,B00078MDB4,"The picture and sound quality of the DVDs in this box set are very good considering the source material the producer had to work from.  It is much superior to the inferior bootleg videos that were the only option available to fans searching for this series.  THANK YOU ""SHOUT FACTORY"" for releasing this funny, funny series.  I hope younger generations will take the time to watch and enjoy the ""situations"" their parents and grandparents experienced in the 60's.",1401321600,3,463,4.910256410256411
2204972,5,B00078MDB4,"I bought season1 of Dobie Gillis,because I never saw the series before&when I watched it I was in for a treat! Thats when I decided to get season2,still in for a treat! Very good show!",1395792000,4,184,4.285714285714286
2204973,5,B00078MDB4,This is so so great!  I can not wait for the release of season 3.  This is a really great dvd set!  You will love it!  Great show!,1393718400,2,130,3.5357142857142856
2204974,5,B00078MDB4,"How great to see Dobie and Maynard on DVD.  I've been waiting for a volume set like this for years.
Like Groovy.  They don't make tv shows like these anymore.",1269820800,2,158,4.233333333333333
2204975,4,B00078MDB4,"""Speedy Delivery...exactly what was describe...it's a gift for my uncle who misses the way TV used to be...he's going to LOVE IT!!!""",1245974400,3,132,5.045454545454546
2204976,3,B00078MDB4,"I have not yet watched all of them, but those I have gave me the impression that this is a collection of episodes that didn't make the original cut for airing, because I watched Dobie when it was aired and don't remember any of these; and they aren't as funny as I remember the series.

Good video transfer, though.",1239235200,3,315,4.338983050847458
2204977,5,B00078MDB4,"this series was very special in the 50s
as it is today
i feel anybody from my age group will love the nostelgia
happy viewing",1226188800,3,125,4.04
2204978,5,B00078MDB4,"The high moral values that the first TV reared generation learned, by the early sixties, started to get some serious writer support in this often socially satirical popular sit-com.  Contrast the sexual and so-called work ethic values in Dobie Gillis as opposed to the ones written about in series, of the same years, like ""Leave It To Beaver.""  A friend of mine's mother's friend helped write some the the last of the Bever episodes, and she was having trouble in the 60s still portraying the by then old fashioned and Puritan-like sexual mores the show had always portrayed.  Though the writers of both series still got in some pretty caustic comments about the sordid ways of the world, the transfer of the an open attitude toward sexuality had not yet gone from Playboy Magazine to general public participation in a general US popular ""sexual revolution"" on the part of the WWII baby boom generation.

""Love That Bob"" had co-starred Dwane Hickman as Comming's nephew, and that show made a playboy-like lifestyle seem benign.  The self-hatred of the religious concept of ""original sin,"" the means by which God enables people to be born into this world, is still one of the means by which, still, religions and politicians brainwash the young and mostly poor to fight wars enriching even the already wealthy, lead by the old, dynastic families, corporations and assorted Manmmon and Mars worshippers.

Even though Maynord G. Krebs was an attempt to co-opt and ridicule an anti-war and anti-alienated work-yourself-to-death capitalistic life, portraying the already disappearing beatnik culture, even jazz, an art form generally hated by fascist reactionaries like J. Edgar Hover, as stupid and lazy goof-offs, the mid sixties Hippies founded a lifestyle that reminded me of the Hebrews as portrayed in ""The Ten Commandments.""  They paired up fast, were extreamly faithful to partners, and large numbers joined the ""back to the land movement,"" many eventually becoming like the Johnny Carson produced movie homeowners in ""The Big Chill.""

In the late 1980s, during the Reagan fascist spell, the ""Captan"" from the ""Gilligan's Island"" series came to our town to help in a charity event, and David Faustino was there too.  I walked up to the captan, even more rotund than when he was on the island, and said ""Hey now sir, how'd you like working with Maynard G. Krebs, and he smiled very broadly, shook my hand regularly Roman fashion, indicating we had no sword in our right hands, and then immediatly switch me into the thumb embraced clasping handshake so popular in the 1960s amon the hip young people then.

No words needed, just two souls meeting at a mind oasis, in the midst of the myopic intellectual, moral desert created by the right-wing Milton Friedman ""new economics,"" started in the mid-sixtiers falacy, that there's no difference between economic wants and needs, everything is just a want.

""Repeal the sixties,"" as President Reagan said he'd do, has been largely done  And the Bush-Clinton-BushII presidencies have repealed the 1930s, except to adopt many of the same measures enacted by Nazi Germany in the early 30s.",1224892800,8,3133,5.038684719535784
2204979,4,B00078MDB4,"""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" remains one of my all-time favorite TV series (along with ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and The Twilight Zone""), so I was delighted to find the entire series on one set.  Unfortunately, these prints are no better than my old Beta and VHS copies recorded from the old Christian Broadcasting Network and TV Land.  In fact, that's exactly where many of these recordings come from -- dubbed from cable TV broadcasts, complete with network logos on the screen.  The syndicated versions have several minutes cut to make way for extra commercials, so you're not getting complete episodes in many cases.  Despite the less than stellar quality of the prints, this series is still one of the all-time greats in terms of writing and performance, so until Fox (or whichever company now holds the rights) gets around to an official release, this bootleg set is as good as you're likely to find.  The copyright on each of these episodes was renewed, by the way, so the films are not in the public domain, which makes it all the more surprising that none are available legitimately.",1224028800,31,1095,4.742105263157895
2204980,5,B00078MDB4,"I barely remember these, as a seven year old - but I am delighted to state that they have held up far better than expected. For writing that is fifty years old, they seem as if they were produced yesterday. Tuesday Weld is remarkable - funny, nuanced, peppery, intelligent and stunning. The entire cast is perfection. To my knowledge, this is one of the first TV shows where characters addressed the camera in Shakespearean asides or soliloquies. Very effective and very fresh. The pacing is fast, the jokes dead on and droll and of course Bob Denver, as the beatnick Maynard, is the looney but eerily, culturally presaging Maynard. The prints are not restored, but they are completely watchable and look exactly like I recall them on our black and white TV. Run out and find these - and you will laugh out loud, they way my world-weary twelve year old nephews did. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1214784000,34,886,4.72258064516129

8045834,5,B00078MDB4,"The series is great! Superb! Innovative! BUT the last season is inferior to the first three.
They began to remove Dobie from the plots. They tried replacing him with a younger actor. Then they got rid of the kid and made it the Maynard show! What a mistake. They say that Dwayne looked too old. No he didn't. Not at all. When the series ended he was 28 years old. But hey, he still looked young and the viewers saw him as Dobie and the STAR.
The worst segment in season four is Maynard's pet monkey painting  Whistler's Mother!  It's sad to see such a talented cast used so badly in those episodes.
Toward the end of the season they tried to resurrect the old cast and formula. It was too late. The public was now watching The Virginian on NBC. Sad.
Get the other seasons. A lot of this series is genius.",1472947200,,804,4.248366013071895
