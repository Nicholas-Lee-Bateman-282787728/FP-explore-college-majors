I'm a Kapuso and I'm not a fan of the Horror/Suspense genre so I was really cynic to watch this movie. But I'm glad I did because for almost two hours, it scared the hell out of me.
Like any other horror movie, I thought it had a simple plot. A local girl (Empress Schuck) was raped and murdered in an old pension house, which has been turned into an inn in present time. Her ghost haunts rapists, pedophiles, and murderers - like a vigilante in their vicinity. Fast forward to present time, a family moves in after a very tragic accident. Headed by a widowed housewife Rosa (Angel Aquino) decides to take her two sons - visually impaired Amiel (Martin del Rosario) and rebellious Rommel (Enrique Gil) to manage the haunted inn, not knowing the inn's terrible past and the ghost that lurk the place.
Simple plot, right? What a cliche. But this isn't just the deal. There are twists along this simple plot which explains why Rommel hates his Mother, why the ghost is appearing more often now, why at Rosa only, why Rosa is under medication, why Amiel is such a calm and soothing figure, and a lot of other whys. But in the right pace, everything will be revealed in such a well-woven way. Well, I know there will be twists because something is very wrong with the characters but the shocking revelations will take this movie apart from the other stereotype horror films we have all seen in the past. That's when you'll say, `Aaaaahhhh....'
I'd like to start my critique on the house. I've researched it was located in Tanay, Rizal. The fog adds an eery mystery, which is just perfect for a horror film's setting. The cast was perfectly assembled. But I have to tip my hat to Enrique Gil, who was quite a revelation. I thought Gil is just another teen star who came to limelight in 2010. I haven't seen his previous works but he really did a decent job playing Rommel, my favorite character in the story. I don't think any other actor his age and tenure could have given justice to Rommel's fast change of moods and character building from a hateful son full of angst to a guy in love with his kababata. He obviously proves in this movie that he is not just another handsome face and he is more than his `doggie' moves.
The film is directed by Topel Lee, known for horror films and like Sidney Sheldon, loves strong female protagonists. In Amorosa, he again showed a woman's strength and vulnerability in Rosa, who although scarred from a tragic accident will summon all her strength to protect her sons. The two reasons why anyone would want to watch this movie aside from the fact that you want to be scared, are the subplot and twists. The real heart of the movie is the relationship of a mother and son with all its ups and downs. If you don't believe in ghosts, at least you believe in that bond.",1365120000,,2820,4.467054263565892
