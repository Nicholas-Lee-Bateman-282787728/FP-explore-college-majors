2171534,5,B00067BBVE,"This collection of 20 segments includes vintage television appearances, live concert footage from Opryland, music videos and a pair of TV commercials. It's a superb look at Jennings as both a live performer and a commercial commodity. The program opens as then-defunct hippie affectations were cropping up in the oddest of mainstream places. The 1970 appearance on the Johnny Cash show still finds Jennings Nashville-slick with his well-kempt hair, but the band displays extra-Nashville influences with a double-neck guitar and a flower-power sticker on the electric bass.

The leap to track 2 picks up four years later with a signature appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert television program. These segments find Jennings' hair and beard grown out, and his music and band tuned to fit a rock audience. Jennings plays country rock (including excellent versions of Billy Joe Shaver's ""Honky Tonk Heroes"" and ""Slow Rollin' Low""), but with the showmanship of a rock band. Aside from Red Rhodes western shirt, Jennings' group looks like a rock band, and they play with enough aggression to please the longhairs, headbands and rednecks in the audience. The staging and camera work are superb.

Next up are five segments taken from Jack Clement's TV show that feature a similar band, but with a different vibe. Set in a studio Jennings and band pull back ever so slightly, playing as much for each other as for the cameras. Jennings smiles his way through an extended take of ""I'm a Ramblin' Man,"" offering up some awesome lead guitar as the band jams; Willie Nelson's ""It's Not Suppose to be That Way"" shows Jennings gripping presence as a ballad singer. A sit-down solo acoustic take of ""Waymore's Blues,"" complete with lit cigarette in his guitar's headstock, is mesmerizing in the ease with which he segues from singing to chatting with his wife, Jessi Colter. The camerawork isn't up to that of the Kirshner shows, with zooms and tight close-ups that create more of a documentary feel.

Film of a 1978 Opryland concert finds Jennings still a potent force on stage, but working through a catalog of chart-topping hits is simply a less urgent showcase. The difference between the Kirshner and Opryland audiences is stark, with the former standing and hollering their encouragement, and the latter (primarily industry executives) seated, listening and applauding politely. ""Are You Sure Hank Done it This Way"" would surely have had the crowd on their feet just about anywhere but Opryland. The video is well shot and edited, with multiple cameras, video overlays and dissolves.

The mid-80s music video for ""The Conversation"" features Jennings and Hank Jr. in a barroom, engaged in a musical discussion about Hank Sr. ""Never Could Toe the Mark"" is choreographed as an intimate band sound check and ""America"" is a highly-produced piece whose stock images seem more like the director's vision that Jennings'. All three are interesting additions, but none of them pack the charge of the live appearances. The closing pair of TV commercials, particularly the 1976 spot for ""Wanted! The Outlaws,"" are a treat, particularly for those who came to Jennings after his mid-70s peak.

This DVD is a superb companion to RCA/Legacy's recently released 4-CD Waylon Jennings box set. The earlier segments demonstrate the rock-like edginess Jennings brought to his music and the stage, and the later segments show the mainstream eventually catching up. Throughout, Jennings comes through as an individual bent on playing his music his way. The video transfers are excellent, and the sound is very good throughout. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]

Note to Jennings collectors: this is *not* the 1966 American International Pictures film of the same title.",1164067200,20,3734,5.153465346534653

CANNOT ADD MUCH TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID ABOUT ITS CONTENT, THE QUALITY OF SOUND AND PICTURE IS WONDERFUL, AND A GREAT ADDITION FOR ANY FAN OF OUTLAW,COUNTRY, OR JUST DAMM GOOD MUSIC.MOST FANS WILL ALREADY HAVE THE LOST OUTLAW CONCERT,SO MAYBE DON'T NEED THEM AGAIN, BUT ITS SO GOOD WHO CAN COMPLAIN. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A STARTER FOR SOME MORE MATERIAL TO BE MADE AVAILABLE,MUST BE A LOT OUT THERE, SO LETS ALL SUPPORT THIS RELEASE--YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",1163808000,12,558,4.534653465346534
2171536,5,B00067BBVE,"First off, I'd like to begin by clearing up a couple misconceptions:

1) this is NOT the 1966 film of the same name;

2) there is NOT a 100-page booklet included.

Both these points have erroneously appeared on a number of online-retailer websites.

This IS a companion piece to the acclaimed 4-CD box set of the same title.

The DVD menu opens with the flipping thru of a Waylon scrapbook...flipping a bit too fast to really study the pix but that's OK as most are included in the lavish 144 page book that comes with this DVD's big brother box set of the same title, also in stores now.

Here's what you'll see:

1. Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line

- from the Johnny Cash Show, 1970. Waylon had just won a Grammy for MacArthur Park and JRC congratulates him on that significant accomplishment. Waylon throws in that even JR ain't done that yet. Before launching into 'ONLY DADDY' they exchange the now-familiar comments about the time they shared a room at the Fontaine Bleu apartments in Madison -- where JR points out that during that era he felt that 'Waylon wouldn't ever amount to nuthin...'. He was sure wrong about that!! ;-)

2. Honky Tonk Heroes

3. Louisiana Woman

4. This Time

5. Slow Rollin Low

- trax 2-5 are from ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"", 1974. Sounds a helluvalot like the September recordings in Texas that same year. As opposed to the August 1978 'Lost Outlaw Performance' -which was attended exclusively by a very boring bunch of industry executives- these songs were recorded before a typical 70's crowd!!! :-)

6. Lonesome, Onry & Mean

7. Ramblin Man

8. It's Not Supposed To Be That Way

9. Amanda

10. Waymore's Blues

- now, for the real treat....when he was producing Waylon's 'DREAMING MY DREAMS' album, brother-in-law/outlaw Cowboy Jack Clement was also doing a bit of taping. We've previously seen only but a clip of 'LONESOME, ON'RY & MEAN' in Waylon's official vid-ography -- but now, we get the song in its entirety as well as the 4 others listed above. For those fascinated with Waylon's formidable geetar-pickin, you'll find the extended version of 'RAMBLIN' MAN' to be well worth the price of admission. I especially enjoyed 'WAYMORE'S BLUES' which has Waylon sitting on a park bench, playing his acoustic, alongside Lil Miss Jessi. There's some great banter between the two --- as well as a real good hint that there's more to come!!!

11. Luckenbach, TX

12. Mammas, Don't Let Your....

13. Good Hearted Woman

14. Are You Ready...

15. Are You Sure Hank....

- trax 11-15 are from the aforementioned 'Lost Outlaw Performance' taped at Opryland, 1978.08.12

16. The Conversation (w/ Hank Jr)

17. Never Could Toe The Mark

18. America

- while many have seen these music vids before, they are great examples of the post-crazy-year portion of this fabulous sampling of the 14 year period in Waylon's career covered by this disc.

19. Commercial for Waylon's Greatest Hits

20. Commercial for Outlaws album

- while not in chrono-order [?] the inclusion of these rare TV spots is a great way to finish off the collection...especially with so many of Waylon's die-harder fans not having even been born when they originally aired.

I'm still hoping that RCA/Legacy will release a deluxe version of the NASHVILLE REBEL music and vid set -- as they did with Cash's THE LEGEND. Considerably more expensive, the deluxe version of that title includes a 12x16 hard-cover coffee table book, additional music and vids as well as s limited edition litho and some other goodies.

Hummm, and wouldn't it be great if it all were packaged in a real, hand-tooled leather coat!!

Be sure and get this DVD as soon as you're able. I believe the retail is 12.99 and can be had for as little as 9.99 -- so be sure to shop around to find the best buy.",1162684800,59,3774,4.701219512195122
2171537,5,B00067BBVE,"Finally available! Waylon fans that appreciate his early Nashville sound RCA years will enjoy this. The story is of course good ol'corny fun because this was a promo movie - no brilliant writing here!  Waylon stars as Arlen Grove, who's just out of the service and needs a job and a home. He gets that, and a girl, and a gig at the local honky tonk where he gets ""discovered"" by a smarmy Nashville talent manager. What follows are the tribulations of his rise to fame. In addition to being a fun look at Waylon acting the good hearted, exploited ""hunk"", there's some nifty footage of Nashville & the Opry back in the day - Loretta Lynn, the Wilburn Brothers, Porter Wagoner, Faron Young (at an outdoor venue complete with live crowd shots), Tex Ritter performing Hillbilly Heaven, shots of the famous Tootsie's and more. Features the Waylon tunes Green River, I'm A Long Way From Home, Nashville Bum, Nashville Rebel, and Tennessee. If you're a die-hard Waylon fan like me - and you don't limit yourself to his later sound - you gotta have it!",1144281600,5,1043,4.60752688172043

2171616,5,B00067BBVE,"First off...why they'd called this DVD ""Nashville Rebel"" when in 1967 Waylon starred in a film under the same name is sorta odd and confusing.
  Great Gem of a DVD which classic LIVE peformances and a few Videos. Waylon was a true superstar and a country/rock legend. Young people, get this DVD and see some real great music!
  All the clips are in pristine quality, as good as you can get from vintage tv.
These are all LIVE performances, no Lip sync (except the Videos ""The Conversation"" and ""America"").
  You get a 1969 or 70 clip from the Johnny Cash show doing ""Only Daddy that'll walk the line"".
You get a great 1974 live show from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, then 1976 Jack Clement's show, then a 1978 Live show from the Grand Ole Opry.  Then the two videos and some promo spots. This is a RCA release, it's too bad they didn't get the rights to include 1990 Epic Video of ""Wrong"" and later video ""The Wild Ones"".
This is a GREAT DVD you can enjoy and see again and again, the songs are full length and not cut short like so many new DVD's these days.  Enjoy!",1310860800,6,1067,4.326633165829146

have always loved Waylon, especially after seeing that movie !!!I had no problem returning the product and was refunded my money very quickly. Thank you Amazon",1294531200,,426,4.023529411764706

2171645,2,B00067BBVE,"I was disappointed with this video.  Waylon Jennings is surely a major figure in real country music, but this compilation, at least for me, does not reflect his later exciting performances.  And most of the cuts the video and audio were poor.

Better to buy his Live From Austin concert.  This I give five stars to.

Not enough songs on the DVD, tho - even tho 20 is quite a bit.  Loved the first one with his clean cut look, but it just wasnt't the look we've all been used to.

2171649,5,B00067BBVE,"First let me say that I am an absolute diehard Hoss fan, so my review may be a tad slanted.  I received the boxed set and the DVD for Christmas.  I haven't watched the DVD yet, but I have listened to cds - over & over.  I love the way the discographers put this box set together.  The songs run in chronological order from the admittedly phonetic (and sometimes pigdin Cajun) rendering of ""Jole Blon"" (thank Buddy Holley for this recording)to the final years of his career.  This chronology allows the listener to truly appreciate Waylon's growth not just as a singer, but also as a songwriter, a musician, and a man.  While I have always loved Waymore's ""Lonesome, Onry, & Mean"" era (I go crazy over his growls and whup whups), I have now become a fan of his early years - the years when his voice, smooth as velvet, was a far cry from what it became.  The man was awesome throughout his life and this box cd set is the best way for the newbie Waylon fan to learn his music and old fans such as myself to put it all into perspective.

The biggest regret of my life is not seeing Hoss on stage.  Don't make the mistake of not buying this cd set - it will set you on the path to real country music - country music as it is meant to be.  If you listen to 98.1 and adore Keith Urban, maybe this set will liberate you from the clutches of Music Row's clones.",1169164800,5,1354,4.153256704980843
