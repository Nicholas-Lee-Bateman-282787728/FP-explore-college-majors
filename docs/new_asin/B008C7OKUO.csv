I had originally watched the movie a couple of years ago at my University. I absolutely loved it. Ever since I've recommended it to many of my friends, but it is hard to find. I'm really grateful that I just ordered a copy on Blu ray! Most of it takes place in Taipei, Taiwan and there are many famous actors in the movie. 3 of my favorites are also in this movie. Mark Chao, Zhao Wei and Amber Kuo. Prior to watching this movie I was not familiar with the country Taiwan. After watching this movie it has been part of my inspiration to travel to Taiwan and in learning Mandarin Chinese. A must own for anyone even if you have never seen an Asian movie or drama before. I can't wait for this to come in so I can re-watch it myself and with my close friends!",1424908800,,872,4.165680473372781
