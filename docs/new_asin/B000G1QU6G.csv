8486810,2,B000G1QU6G,"I am disappointed with this documentary.  Firstly, the picture quality is not consistently good.  Secondly, the content is mostly biographical, which is to be expected, of course, but is overall rather staid.  Indeed, the information on the political, industrial, and social developments of the Bronte period is satisfactory, albeit presented in a sullen tone.  Lively interviews with scholars, writers, and students of the Bronte works would have introduced a variety of view points on the Bronte sisters.  Also, such interviews would have breathed some life into this documentary which relies almost exclusively on a narrator's voice with occasional and somewhat dull dramatizations of journals and novel excerpts.  Only the view of the Yorkshire moors and their influence on the Bronte Sisters' work make this documentary worth some attention.",1171843200,11,846,5.5703125
