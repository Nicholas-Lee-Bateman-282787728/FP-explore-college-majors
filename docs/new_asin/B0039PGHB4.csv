4097199,5,B0039PGHB4,"I happened on to this movie yesterday on Lifetime.  Decided to check it out for a couple of moments before I was going to turn the channel.  To my surprise, I was immediately hooked.  This is such an unexpected beautiful and endearing movie. It touches on so many levels of humanity.  I loved it so much and can not believe I never even heard anything about it.  How could such a great story (movie) like this go unnoticed, maybe it is going to be one of those soon to be cult films.  It really is a special movie that everyone can fully enjoy of all age groups.  I even now have it on my wish list and can not wait until it is released in October.",1281830400,4,648,4.095238095238095
4097200,5,B0039PGHB4,"We happened upon this movie on a ""chick-flick"" channel, not expecting too much. It stars one of my favorite actors, Joe Mantegna, so we tuned in to check it out. What a gem! My entire family and I got hooked from the very beginning, and were mesmerized until the end. The male lead, Max Minghella, was absolutely charming and we could not take our eyes off of the screen when he was in the shot. The entire cast was excellent, as was the directing. I am still thinking about this unique and extremely well-done movie. I highly recommend it.",1281657600,22,540,4.4646464646464645

4097209,5,B0039PGHB4,"I cannot believe that I have never seen this movie. Apparently it was made before Blake lively was even cast in Gossip Girls, but she began starring in that before this was actually released. That is apparently what helped this movie - her stardom.

For me, however, this movie is beyond Blake Lively. It is a movie about two people with flaws and pasts that have crept into their present lives.

Annabelle and Elvis trying to navigate this world and discovering that you can't run away forever. At some point you have to face things. But that doesn't mean you have to face them alone.

I rather wish we knew what happened to them. Do they ever find out they each saved each other from suicide?

What happens with Annabelle's mother...",1465689600,3,735,4.587786259541985

I kept wanting to turn this off and wish my money back !! But she is all lovey-dovey with it . I have to somehow sell this to someone out there -- who is more like my wife -- and goes for this crap ! I think the only reason this would sell to anybody , is the clever trick the writers pulled on everyone , by putting the name ELVIS in its title . They should be ashamed of themselves !!!",1405641600,,560,3.5609756097560976

4097244,4,B0039PGHB4,"I saw this on the IFC channel and found it very enjoyable. It was shot around Austin, Texas which I could identify with since my Dad lived in the Hill Country since the early 1980's.  Good acting all around; several nice plot twists, just a solid story line, for not expecting much I got much more.",1377993600,,298,4.321428571428571

4097246,5,B0039PGHB4,"Just a different kind of story!  I enjoyed it; passed it around the family and they all loved it.  Take a chance on this one,  I think you will be surprised.",1377388800,,157,4.0
4097247,3,B0039PGHB4,I don't hate it but I don't like it either because of the color image so I'm indifferent about it,1376006400,,97,3.9
4097248,4,B0039PGHB4,"I liked Elvis and Anabelle. The plot was not as predictable as most romance movies, it had a different slant that was intriguing. It also had an uplifting message in the end.",1374192000,,174,4.46875
4097249,4,B0039PGHB4,"I may be a little biased. I attended the premier of this movie in Austin, Texas because I have a relative in the film. No spoilers - I will just say he appears in the opening scenes and has no lines. So I went to the premier to see him, I was pleasantly surprised by this little movie. As a early horror film fan, the subtle homage to many of my favorites was a nice little bonus. The score and 'background' noise brought a smile to my face on during several scenes. Fans of Edgar Allen Poe will delight at his themes being explored amidst a 'sea' of sunflowers.

This is not a horror flick though, it is a sweet little romance. Growing up in Texas I feel like I went to high school with some of these people. The prom/beauty queen, the pervert step father, the mother living her beauty pageant dreams through the daughter, the quiet boy who sits in the back of class and is likely the most interesting person in the room.

Watch it for the fun of it.",1373587200,2,951,4.191256830601093
4097250,5,B0039PGHB4,"I recorded this movie during a free-movie-channel weekend after reading the weird synopsis... WHAT A CUTE MOVIE! I watched it three times that weekend and found myself talking about it to everyone who would listen! I had no idea who Max Minghella was but WOW. I suspect he will go on to do a lot more amazing movies. Joe Montanega is fantastic.
I immediately decided I needed to own this film and since recieving it, have watched it a few more times. It doesn't get old. My old ""go to"" was Baz's Romeo and Juliet, so I guess you can say I'm a dark romantic type anyway. I'm a sucker for love stories!!
Do yourself a favor and watch this movie! You won't be disappointed.",1372896000,4,670,4.368
4097251,5,B0039PGHB4,I loved this movie and have already recommended it to many people. I have no idea why this movie didn't make more noise when it came out. I am a Blake Lively fan and she proved why in her role for this movie. Watch it. Now.,1370908800,,223,3.869565217391304
4097252,4,B0039PGHB4,The story on this one is a little different which is why I ultimately liked it.  The relationship and chemistry between the leads is good and the story in many ways is very sweet.  This was a surprising and happy add to my movie collection.,1370563200,,240,4.311111111111111
4097253,5,B0039PGHB4,This is such a sweet love story.  I like that its not your average love story.  Must have for your movie collection.,1369180800,,116,4.2272727272727275
4097254,5,B0039PGHB4,"OK I was somewhat skeptical about this movie before I saw it, and I generally do not enjoy nor endorse independent films. But Elvis and Anabelle was a movie that I simply had to own after seeing it the first time.  It started out a little confusing because I was not sure whether it was syfi, or fantasy or what. But soon enough the story got me sucked in. Max Minghella and Blake Lively do such a good job and they are both EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE in their roles, both in appearance and in character personality.  They are true and realistic characters. I recommend this movie to anyone!",1369094400,4,585,4.457943925233645
4097255,5,B0039PGHB4,"There's something incredibly profound about this movie. Make sure you buy tissues, too. May I suggest an economy sized pack? Even though most people have not taken the measures these two have, we can all identify with the feeling that encompasses this movie.",1367452800,,258,5.023255813953488
4097256,4,B0039PGHB4,I was supprised by this movie. It is very good. The title does not give a clue and it turned me off until I actually sat down to watch. It is a very strong movie. I must recommend it.,1366588800,,183,3.717948717948718
4097257,2,B0039PGHB4,"I felt it was too dry and it dragged in parts. It could have had a stronger story line, parts of it was really boring.",1365120000,,118,3.76
4097258,5,B0039PGHB4,"Great movie, Initially saw it on TV and loved it! Such a great story line, not your typical romance...loved the main characters.",1365033600,,128,4.863636363636363
4097259,5,B0039PGHB4,"Great off-shoot of an old tale, told in sort of a black humor manner.  I thought it was cute and the actors did a good job.  Some parts were as expected, but the finale was quite nice the way they finished.",1364515200,,206,4.0

4097262,4,B0039PGHB4,"I had seen this wonderful film once before and just caught it again on one of the cable channels.  This is one of those films where the synopsis might fail to reveal what a good film it really is.  With a cast which includes Blake Lively, Mary Steenbergen, Keith Carradine and Max Minghella, along with a very different performance by Joe Mantegna, who is one of my favotite actors, as alocal mortician with a hunch back, this movie works on so many levels.  It is a combination of happy, sad, funny and occassionally strange.  I totally enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend it to anyone (not only women) who likes good heart warming films.  It may be thought of as a 'chick-flick' but it most definitely is more than that.  Watch  it and ENJOY.",1358380800,,756,4.555555555555555
4097263,3,B0039PGHB4,"I happened upon this little known/reviewed movie and saw the good reviews on Amazon - figured I'd watch. Elvis & Anabelle is a weird, twisted sort of love story. It's hardly your traditional, ""Notebook"" love. But it certainly plays to the classic romance cliche of not judging a book by its cover.

With a father that suffers from memory loss and a happenstance, posthumous burial of a beauty queen, Elvis (the lead) kisses the the girl and she comes alive. In this magical realism, ala Sleeping Beauty, she awakens. With her second life, Anabelle searches for herself and finds Elvis as an intriguing companion.

With deeply moving scenes about death and suicide, this movie had such potential to balance reality and magic. Instead, the movie was incredibly average and nearly became Romeo & Juliet towards the end. Solid B flick.",1346630400,,831,4.928571428571429
4097264,5,B0039PGHB4,"This movie is such an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Not only does it probe life as often experienced by real people, it conveys such a depth of appreciation for the ties we have with others that I could not possibly express in words how moving some moments are in this gem of a film.

Sadly, almost no-one has even heard about this movie. That is tragic, as it should be a must-see for everyone. While cleverly skirting a spiritual message, this script manages to also not exclude those of us who love to see the everyday moments that keep us longing to live. Truly, the most moving and touching moments in life are those that may, at first blush, seem mundane. Yet these are often the moments that live forever in your memory.

And they are sometimes the moments that represent the Great Turning Points in life. This film captures that fact in ways that are all too often lacking in any form of entertainment.

Can lying in a field of sunflowers change your life? You bet it can!

See this film!!!",1345334400,,1002,4.489010989010989
4097265,4,B0039PGHB4,"Fell a bit in love with this movie. It's a little on the surreal side at times, but the acting is amazing. Love both of the main characters and the vibe from this movie. Watch it if you want to get pulled into a sweet love story.",1342483200,,229,3.893617021276596
4097266,3,B0039PGHB4,"I was very excited to see this movie after reading all the wonderful reviews, but frankly I was disappointed. Blake Lively and Max Minghella were excellent, but Joe Mantegna was almost laughable. It seemed as if he wasn't sure how to play this role and just decided to take it as far as possible.

The visual feel of this film was lovely even if the plot was a bit unbelieveable. The ending however was much too far-fetched and tied together too nicely, and the subtle hints that Annabelle's stepfather was abusing her were never explained. I appreciated this movie for what it was, a chick-flick with a bit of a dark twist, but in my opinion this movie is deserving of three stars, not five.",1341878400,,692,4.536
4097267,5,B0039PGHB4,"Great Movie!!!  This is definitely a chick flick...I don't remember this in the theater...but if I had known about it, I would have paid to see it more than once. Glad I found it on Amazon!!!",1339027200,,191,4.305555555555555

4097271,5,B0039PGHB4,"This movie was a total delight...an unlikely love story between two very different people.  It touched my heart and made me feel good about life's happy endings.  I have shown this movie to several women, and they all loved it!",1314921600,6,227,4.65
4097272,5,B0039PGHB4,I absolutely fell in love with this film from the second I heard the concept. I have watched many crappy quality versions of this film to sate my addiction and am ecstatic that it is finally on DVD. I would prefer Blu-ray but it's a small price to pay for such a wonderful film. LOVE LOVE LOVE,1311120000,,293,4.157894736842105
4097273,5,B0039PGHB4,Great movie that I could watch with my 14 year old daughter and not feel uncomfortable. No F bombs or out of control sex scenes. I love the way the director shot this film. Beautiful imagery!,1304208000,,191,4.333333333333333
4097274,5,B0039PGHB4,"I rented this on Netflix, it was so good I had to have it for my DVD collection. It starts off a little dark and creepy, but it ends well. As odd as it is, the handsome (Max Minghella) Elvis is a lovable character. I was really surprised by Blake Lively's acting, it was surprisingly good. Each shot is as beautiful as it is on the cover.

EDIT: so I bought this movie again, having lent out my copy, arrived fast and Im great condition, excited to watch it with the hubby and step daughter, Im sure theyll love it. As one reader said Im sure Max Minghella will go on to do great things. Honestly hes the reason I stuck with A Handmaids Tale on Hulu.",1304121600,,650,4.118110236220472

This is the first movie in quite some time, catching my interest enough to keep me awake the whole time.  Love stories don't usually do the trick, so I can't exactly categorize it in that way.  I am ordering it for my friend who spends his retirement growing and loving sunflowers.  He too believes in miracles.",1300579200,,389,4.361111111111111

4097278,5,B0039PGHB4,"This is my first review, but so worth it for this movie. I saw this movie a little over a year ago on Lifetime. This channel is a last resort on long rainy days when there's nothing else on. It was the first time they were showing a movie that wasn't about some extremely dramatic situation; ie. young woman abused by father grows up and kills husbands for money until her mother breaks her legs and leaves her wheel chair bound at which point she meets an older doctor and marries who keeps her in the basement and raises their children. So this movie's story line was a welcome relief; enjoyable and very romantic, without being too sappy.
I've waited all this time for it to go on sale and it was well-worth the wait!",1286928000,3,720,4.340740740740741
4097279,3,B0039PGHB4,"I got this for my store due to all of the stellar reviews here and elsewhere, and I can see where some people might get a few things out of it, but there were way too many faults for it to be the 5-star listed here.

The story follows an unlicensed embalmer played by Minghella that while under the brain-damaged eye of his father (adequately filled by Joe Mantegna) miraculously brings back to life the beautiful dead-girl client played by Lively. No explanations are given either way regarding faith/science so the movie focuses more on the resulting love story. Carradine and Steenburgen overact their bits, and the amount of flubs are prevalent throughout (crew members in reflections, 10' rain circles around characters for mood while it is sunny out - multiple times, bad stock in some scenes where there is a film line right through their face, indoor sequences that were supposed to be at night but it is sunny outside, sound mix off, bad CGI at the end, etc.). The story does have some touching moments, but it is almost a minimalist film with the amount of slow build and deliberate heart-string moments.

The picture quality varies throughout but maintains overall and the sound is an average 5.1. The only special feature is an eight minute director interview laden with film clips so there are only a few informative moments. 3.5 stars for the film, one extra and seeing Blake Lively for 105 minutes. A rental at most.",1286582400,5,1431,4.742971887550201
4097280,5,B0039PGHB4,"I've never reviewed anything on Amazon or elsewhere online but this film has spurred me to. My wife had seen a trailer of this on another DVD and decided to rent it. She watched it for the first time and loved it so much she watched it a second time straight away that same evening; then for a third time with me. I didn't expect much but, like the previous two reviewers, was hooked at once. The central characters are so likeable and played so deftly and delicately by leads Max Minghella and Blake Lively that I couldn't help be drawn into their simple but compellingly romantic story of young love. I understand this film took a while to get greenlit and didn't get a theatrical release, which is a great shame. Minghella and Lively have deservedly gone on to plenty of jobs, but writer/director Will Geiger seems not to have to the same extent - he deserves to get many more films made.",1283644800,13,891,4.439024390243903
8392219,5,B0039PGHB4,"Great if you want to see Blake Lively before her plastic surgery. When she first appeared I didn't recognize her. Psychologist David Buss, at UT Austin, said babies of all races think that the same people are the beautiful people.",1525478400,,230,4.775

THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR FAILURE IN MARRIAGE AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IS INSUFFICIENT COMMUNICATION. MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY SHARES COMMUNICATION FAILURES MADE BY ME AND SMALLVILLE'S CLARK KENT. THE EXCELLENT ""ROME"" SERIES SHOWS THAT SUCH FAILURE CAN EVEN RESULT IN SUICIDE AND DESTROYED OFFSPRING (NOT TO MENTION FAILURES IN OUR CAREER WHICH IN ""ROME"" LED TO CEASAR'S DEATH).
WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT THE WORLD IS INCREASINGLY TEARING APART RELATIONSHIPS. SOULMATES MUST COMMUNICATE FULLY AND PRIVATELY TO PREVENT OUTSIDE DAMAGE AND TO DEVELOP THE HABIT OF DEFERRING ANSWERS UNTIL SUCH PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS CAN OCCUR. SOME SAY THAT MONEY IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DIVORCE, BUT THIS IS REALLY A LACK OF COMMUNICATION IN PLANNING AND COMPROMISING.
IN ELVIS AND ANABELLE, A FAIRLY ISOLATED ELVIS TAKES CARE OF HIS MENTALLY DISABLED FATHER, EVEN DOING HIS UNDERTAKER WORK FOR HIM.  IN TOWN, A GORGEOUS GIRL NAMED ANABELLE, PLAYED BY GODESS BLAKE LIVELY, IS STARVING HERSELF TO TRY TO BE A BEAUTY PAGENT WINNER. THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF EATING DISORDERS ARE THAT THE GIRLS ARE OFTEN WAY TOO SKINNY AND EVEN DIE FROM THE DISORDER.  ANABELLE DROPS DEAD. ELVIS IS ABOUT TO EMBALM HER, BUT FIRST FEELS LED TO KISS HER. SUDDENLY, A WIND BLOWS THE WINDOWS OPEN AND ANABELLE COMES BACK TO LIFE.
I BELIEVE THAT NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES ARE SOMETIMES GIVEN BY OUR LOVING GOD TO GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER LIFE THAT WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE. CERTAINLY THIS WAS THE CASE FOR ANNABELLE AS HER LIFE WAS ABOUT AS EXCITING AS THAT OF TITANIC'S ROSE DEWITT BUKATER WITH CAL HOCKLEY!
DUE TO YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE AND PERHAPS A BIT OF A LONER, ELVIS DOES NOTHING TO ROMANCE ANNABELLE, WHO EVEN RUNS AWAY FROM HOME TO COME BACK TO THE EXACT SPOT SHE WAS RESURRECTED. LATER LAYING NEXT TO HIM ON A SCENIC QUIET, RURAL BRIDGE, ANNABELLE'S BODY LANGUAGE SENDS SIGNALS TO HIM. (I KNOW THAT I CAN'T RESIST LIVELY'S PHEREMONE SCENT!).  NO RESPONSE, SO SHE STARTS TO CARESS HIM. A BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE DEVELOPS WITH THE DANGERS OF HER APPARENTLY BEING UNDERAGED, AND HIS BRYANESQUE/CLARKESQUE FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE THE TRUTH OF HIS CURRENT FEELINGS FOR THIS SOULMATE AND THE FULL TRUTH OF THE MIRACOUS AND ROMANTIC KISS THAT ""SAVED HER IN EVERY WAY THAT A WOMAN CAN BE SAVED.""  GOD HIMSELF WANTED THIS ONE IN ONE THOUSAND RELATIONSHIP TO OCCUR, AND  SUPERNATURALLY INTERVENED TWICE TO MAKE IT SO!!  HIS WORD TELLS US THAT ONLY 1 IN 1000 PERSONS ARE GOOD. I DEFINITELY BELIEVE HIM!  AND I DEFINITELY ELECT TO BE SUCH A PERSON OF GREAT INNER BEAUTY!  IF THERE ARE ANY BOO'S OUT THERE (SINGLES WITH INNER BEAUTY AND A PERIOD), PLEASE SURPRISE ME BY COMING TO SAMISHBAY TO STAY AS MY GUEST! YOU WILL DEFINITELY BE TREATED LIKE A DAUGHTER OR BEST FRIEND OR MORE IF YOU HAVE LIVEBOO'S MOVES!
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE UNDERAGED, I AM OK WITH IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ADULT EQUIVALENCY LIKE THE VIRGIN MARY DID WHEN SHE WAS BETROTHED TO JOSEPH.  ONE OR MORE BOOBOO'S ARE WELCOME AT MY HOUSE ON SAMISHBAY WHERE THE GOAL IS TO MAKE EVERYDAY CHRISTMAS!
WITH LOVE,
