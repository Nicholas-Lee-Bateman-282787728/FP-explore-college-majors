2794849,5,B000OHZJSC,"The people associated with this film and project have certainly given us new material to consider recently!!  This is such a good, professionally done film with beautiful scenes and views of Jerusalem, the southern Talpiot hills, etc. What a wonderful 'travelogue'!! Gives you a good idea of past and present there.  Makes you see that these people really lived then, and the film gives a clear presentation of all the archeological evidence as it has been analyzed so far. And coming from guys who have researched major archeological and crime-scene sites in the recent past, this is just exceptional.  That people of their calibre would spend so much time and energy to try to bring us all the possible stories of truth in this matter, and not bury it in some dusty warehouse, is just a great testament to their faith and courage that the truth can triumph.  Keep up the good work, guys!!!  We have just one Question:  did anyone in 1980 possibly look at the heel bones of the ""Jesus, son of Joseph"" ossuary before giving them up to the Jewish authorities for reburial?????  we just cannot imagine that they would be so disinterested that they would let that examination pass by??. . . maybe someone did, and that's being covered up????  That info would surely change the statistical analysis!!!",1180051200,12,1297,4.8108108108108105
2794850,5,B000OHZJSC,"The work of an archeologist is to uncover the past. The work of a forensic investigator is to establish identity and causes of death when earthly remains are present..Given a name and a place and scientific testing and the results establish facts that cannot be altered. Science is truthful and religions,myths and legends can decieve.

A cluster of names matching the New Testament family of Jesus(Yeshua---Hebrew Form of his name)in a tomb containing ten ossuaries with six names etched on them including the name of Jesus-son of Joseph dating two thousand years ago and the right location for an extended family tomb containing family members from several generations would conclude and prove this find.

I enjoyed the movie as much as I enjoyed reading the book. I recommend the film viewing to anyone who is interested in Bible Archeology. But beware that it can change your view point about the origins of the Christian religion and the fact that there was no physical ressurection--just a spiritual one. Sad but true. I give the movie a five star rating for education,presentation and enlghtenment. Thank you for this great production. The book THE JESUS FAMILY TOMB is an eye-opening read enjoy both. I'm proud to include the book and the movie in my library collection. I'll be able to enjoy them for years to come.",1179964800,8,1324,4.932735426008969
2794851,4,B000OHZJSC,I can't rate it. I haven't had time to watch it yet. You insisted that I rate this product and I might have given it 5 stars but I haven't seen it yet!,1178928000,,151,3.606060606060606
2794852,4,B000OHZJSC,"Critics of this documentary, as to it's observations and conclusions, make essentially the following arguments:

1. That the Jesus family would be buried in Nazareth, not Talpiot;
2. That the Jesus family couldn't have afforded a tomb like the Talpiot tomb;
3. That the ""Jesus son of Joseph"" ossuary is not inscribed ""Yeshua"" (Jesus) at all;
4. That the ""Mariamne"" ossuary didn't contain the remains of Mary Magdalene, but of two other women.

I believe the first three of these allegations against the documentary's premise don't carry much water. The fourth argument actually supports the conclusion that this is the real thing. My comments on these points:

1. Talpiot is the right place for Jesus' family tomb- Per Luke, 2:3-4, the family's LEGAL residence was Bethlehem, not Nazareth. The fact that Joseph and the pregnant Mary could not take the census in Nazareth but had to take it in Bethlehem indicates that Bethlehem was their DOMICILIUM under Roman Law. That basically means that they had no intention to reside in Nazareth permanently. Therefore it would have made little sense for them to have a family tomb in Nazareth, that they wouldn't be able to frequently visit at a later stage in their lives. They would have wanted a family tomb close to Bethlehem and Jerusalem, easily accessible also to future generations of the family. The fact is indeed that Mary and her children moved to Jerusalem around 30 AD.

The traditional name of Jesus in Hebrew, as reflected also in the Talmud, is ""Yeshu Hanotzri."" This appellation stemms from ""Netzer"" (Shoot or Branch). It alludes clearly to Isaiah 11:1, indicating the Royal birth of Jesus, to substantiate his claim for Jewish messianship. Not to indicate the place he comes from ( to indicate that Jesus supposedly originates from Nazareth, he would have been called ""Yeshua Minatzeret."" But he wasn't called so.) In any event Jesus was born in Bethlehem, even though he grew up in Nazareth. Even when a person was called by a place in Herbew/Aramaic at that time, that appellation would refer to his place of birth, not to where he happens to live at a certain moment in his life. Thus if Jesus were to be called by a place, he would logically be called ""Jesus of Bethlehem.""

There's actually no evidence in Jewish sources, such as the Old Testament or the Mishna and Talmud, that a place called ""Nazareth"" even existed in or before the first century. I'm not disputing the evidence per the NT, that there was indeed a place called Nazareth. But to the best of my knowledge, there's no mention of Nazareth at all in any ancient writings outside the New Testament. So the place existed, but nobody knew about it. Therefore there was no reason to call Jesus ""of Nazareth."" Either in life or on an ossuary. He was called ""Jesus the Branch"" (of David) in Hebrew/Aramaic. It sounds almost the same as ""Jesus of Nazareth"" when pronounced in Hebrew/Aramaic, and therefore would easily confuse any person whose mother tongue isn't Hebrew/Aramaic. But it shouldn't confuse native Hebrew/Aramaic speakers.

The line of argumentation detracting this discovery around the supposed Nazareth origin of Jesus' family may therefore be based on a very shaky foundation.

2. Talpiot is located about 2.5 miles North of Bethlehem. Jesus' family, of Davidic descent according to the New Testament, could have held the burial cave there even before it moved to Nazareth. Davidic birth was absolutely the most exalted in Judaism, always. The suggestion that any person of Davidic descent could be of the lowest social echelon, that couldn't fund or get funding for a burial cave, doesn't make much sense, if any. There's substantial evidence to the contrary, e.g. 1. Jesus had some very wealthy active supporters like Joseph of Arimatea and Nicodemus (known as Nakdimon ben Gorion in post biblical Jewish sources-one of the richest Jews in Judea); 2. Josephus A.J.,XX, 9:1. Note the prominence of James brother of Jesus.

3. The inscription on the Jesus ossuary does say ""Yeshua bar Yehosef"" (""Jesus son of Joseph"")to my eye. All letters but one are quite clearly there. The only letter which is somewhat more difficult to discern at first blush is the second letter- ""Shin"". That's because it's written in a somewhat irregular form (in a regular Shin there are three teeth in the fork, pointing upwards. Here there are two teeth, pointing sideways to the right.) But that particular irregularity appears also on other ossuaries- notably numbers 9 (this one has two ""Shin""- one with three teeth pointing to the right, and one with TWO teeth pointing to the right. Exactly like the subject inscription) and 121 in the Rahmani catalogue, which both feature also a ""Yeshua."" All this is NOT difficult for a Hebrew speaking person to identify.

4. Mr. Huston on 3/13/07 made the following comment to my post regarding Jacobovici's book:

""The inscription, Pfann said, is made up of two names inscribed by two different hands: the first, ""Mariame,'' was inscribed in a formal Greek script, and later, when the bones of another woman were added to the box, another scribe using a different cursive script added the words ""kai Mara,'' meaning ""and Mara.'' Mara is a different form of the name Martha.

According to Pfann's reading, the ossuary did not house the bones of ""Mary the teacher,'' but rather of two women, ""Mary and Martha.'""

Here's my answer to him:

""If the Mariamne ossuary indeed housed the bones of Mary and Martha, these are two sisters of NT fame. Another hit. One of them could have been married to ""Jesus son of Joseph."" -Whether or not she was Mary Magdalene (Maybe the Mary who ointed Jesus feet and then dried them with her hair- very intimate scene.) The other sister would than also automatically belong in the family. It still fits. Actually it increases the statistical odds that this is the real thing quite substantially.""

This is a very intriguing possibility indeed, fitting perfectly with John 12:3. Some posters on an internet group where I participate actually suggested once that similar anointing was part of pre-wedding ritual of a Davidic King, per certain passages in the Song of Songs. Reminds me of the reaction to this find of a BBC reporter in 1996- It seems like all pieces of a puzzle coming together.

Two other matters raised by the documentaray relate to the meaning of the inscription ""Mara"" on one of the ossuaries, and to a proposition that the ""James brother of Jesus"" ossuary originated from the same Talpiot tomb. My comments:

5. Any Jew in the first century would probably know instinctively that ""Mara"" is a very exalted appellation indeed. The Dead Sea Scrolls in at least two places that I saw have the expression ""Mara Alma""- the exact equivalent of ""Adon Olam"" in Hebrew (""Master of the World"".) That is one of the most common substitute names for ""Yahwe"", the ineffable name of God, in Judaism, to this day. Jews repeat this substitute name many times every day, in prayers.

6. Oded Golan is on trial in Israel at this time for alleged forgery of the ""James brother of Jesus"" ossuary. If Mr. Golan believes or knows that the James ossuary is authentic, his defense lawyer should and could get a court order for comparative DNA tests of the James remains with the Jesus remains. The court will most probably grant such an order, because it's material to his defense in a felony case. If this test shows these are siblings, that would constitute sufficient ""reasonable doubt"" to acquit Golan. (And of course enhance the statistical odds that the Talpiot tomb is the real thing.) If it doesn't show they're siblings, the result would be inadmissible as evidence. Therefore there's only an upside on this for Defense.

Incidentally, I believe that the Documentary's story about the ""Jesus"" and other bones having supposedly been buried together in a common grave has to be taken with a grain of salt. It appears to contradict certain burial rules under Jewish Law. In a different context, a poster elsewhere on the net pointed out to me a second century ruling regarding common burials. Seems to me that common burials of unrelated adults are prohibited, where the bones are found separately. Therefore the remains in the ossuaries would be buried separately.

BOTTOM LINE- Ask yourself inversely a hypothetical question- If the Talpiot tomb hadn't yet been found, how would Jesus' family tomb have looked , which ossuaries would it have contained, to when would it have been dated and where would it have been located. Even if, like me, you're not formally educated specifically in any field related to this subject, anyone with general education and common sense who's curious enough could educate himself to form a perfectly valid opinion. I would have thought of a tomb just like the tomb we're discussing. It fits perfectly with what I'd have expected Jesus' family tomb to be. Right place, right period, right names. (Even some important evidence supporting the same expectation that this documentary omits.)

That doesn't mean that the Talpiot tomb is the real thing beyond reasonable doubt, only that if you had a jury of completely unbiased people, either way, and that jury were presented with all material evidence, pro and con, it could quite logically have found that this is the real thing by preponderance of the evidence.

2794853,5,B000OHZJSC,"Devout Christians who consider the physical, bodily resurrection of Jesus to be a necessary and integral part of their beliefs would probably do well to not watch ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"".  However, those who can accept the Resurrection as having spiritual meaning instead or who can approach the subject in a nonreligious context will find this documentary an enthralling presentation about an archaeological discovery made near Jerusalem in 1980: the tomb and physical remains of Jesus of Nazareth and his family, or at the very least that is what the film-makers believe (and they make a persuasive case for their views).  This DVD is the ""director's cut"" version of a documentary originally shown in the US on The Discovery Channel; additional interviews concerning several topics have been added.

This is not some wooly New Age or supernatural-leaning show, heavy on ill-supported speculation and short on hard evidence, but rather a careful documentary laying out the case that the tomb of Jesus (and family) has indeed been found.  I think this to be one of the most fascinating historical television documentaries I have ever seen.

2794855,5,B000OHZJSC,"I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to watch an advance copy of this film, and finding it to be nothing short of fantastic, I had to post this review...

This Directors Cut version of the Discovery Channel Special is one of the finest documentaries I have ever had the chance to watch. Not only does it perform as a content-laden doc, but from a production stand-point, in my opinion, it is a spectacular watch from start to finish, for it feels like a feature film during the viewing, a mystery of the highest caliber as the story develops and unfolds. I sat riveted during the entire experience.

At the root of the story-line is the 1980 uncovering of an underground tomb, found during a construction project in Jerusalem following the bulldozing of an area by developers planning the building of an apartment complex. Two children entered through an entrance-way emblazoned with a ancient chevron and found the extensive, built-out site that contained 10 limestone ossuaries (coffins). Of the ten, 6 had hand-written inscriptions.

The discovery of the tomb in and of itself was not that uncommon. Others had been discovered, so the Israeli authorities were contacted as would be expected. The contents of the tomb were cataloged and brought to a storage facility.

What took place 25 years later lays the groundwork for the film, for upon further inspection of the inscriptions, it came to light that the 6 readable names all related to members of Jesus' family, something that originally was not put together.

As the Director lets the story unfold, the claims themselves are presented as a mystery. Recreations are mixed with expert interviews and scientific corroboration i.e. DNA testing of scrapings from the ossuaries. The filmmaking itself makes use of current technology on numerous fronts including the use of robotic cameras to first enter the tombs (which had been resealed after the contents had been removed).

Adding to all of this is Director Simcha Jocabovici's persona, one that can be compared to an archaeologist on a phenomenal hunt and journey. His personal excitement really adds an incredible dimension to the production. I am not convinced that another Director could have pulled this off with such verve.

Forgetting for a moment the religious ramifications that this film poses, the viewing experience alone is of incredible value on a human-interest level. Adding in the film's claims that have not only a religious bend to them, but also a major historical discovery angle for all people, the film becomes one that certainly leads to, if nothing else, a debate of the highest order.  Jocabovici, an expert filmmaker for sure, has produced a program that is riveting to watch, enlightening to experience and historical to digest.

I recommend this film for all to see.",1175212800,31,2820,5.034334763948498

2794857,3,B000OHZJSC,"I watched this video with an open mind because it's subject matter has been at the center of a lot of controversy, mainly between Joe Zias and the Naked Archeologist Simcha Jacobovici.  There was a big court battle between the two gentlemen, with Jacobovici being accused of falsifying material which is in this documentary.  I read it was a long and drawn out battle with Jacobovici winning the case in the end.

For me personally, and this is just me, I question a couple of things.  After watching this documentary, one of the big question marks for me is that the historicity of crucifixion wasn't mentioned.  It is my understanding that crucifixion by the Roman Empire did not involve burial.  It makes sense that other members of Christ's family may have been buried, but in regards to Christ's burial in a tomb, I have to start with what Roman history teaches about that practice in general and go from there.

One of the other things that I question is the town itself, the town of Talpiot.  And again this may be just me, but I'm not sure that I understand how Christ and his family would be buried in Talpiot when Christ was executed in Jerusalem, and the rest of his family was from Nazareth.

And lastly and probably the biggest problem that I personally had with this documentary was the discovery of the James ossuary that was also supposed to be in the tomb, but was missing and eventually ended up on the antiquities black market by Oded Golan. The inscription on the ossuary supposedly reads, ""James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"".  Since it's discovery, or ""recovery"" - how ever you want to look at it - it's been challenged as a forgery, and Oded Golan did time for it, and the Israeli museum closed the exhibit surrounding it.  So, I suppose my point is, if the James ossuary is a forgery, and it came from the Talpiot tomb, how do they know the others aren't fake as well.

For the time being, for me personally, I'm going to go with what makes sense to me ... or at least until someone can prove without a shadow of a doubt that the Talpiot tomb was the tomb of Christ and his family.",1471564800,,2109,4.463541666666667

Solid people who wanted the best for the others, and were willing to die for it.

2794874,4,B000OHZJSC,"REVIEWING JOINTLY JAMES CAMERON'S AND JOHN ANKERBERG'S VIDEOS ABOUT THE TALPIOT TOMB SUPPOSEDLY OF JESUS AND HIS FAMILY

As a lifelong Christian (except for a short stint of my family in L.D.S. Mormonism as a child), I've been mostly a devout, Confessional Lutheran in convictions, however personal practice has varied from decade to decade. I have to confree, however, that James Cameron's documentary, ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"", initially shook me up a bit. Evangelist and Christian intellectual John Ankerberg is a sectary (having hit close to bottom, his affiliation is essentially Baptist) and a professional apologist for (i.e., defender of) Christianity, at least of sectarian Christianity, but whom, on the whole, genuine, believing Protestants (i.e., Lutherans, Presbyterian/Reformed, Moravian, and Anglican) also can respect, at least to a large degree, however guardedly. Both videos have their origin in broadcast material.

This review is most directly of Ankerberg's video refutation, ""The John Anerberg Show's Response to 'The Lost Tomb of Jesus'"", James Cameron's DVD documentary about the ""lost"" tomb of Jesus and of his family at Talbiot (located within greater al-Quds, in the near region of what is a.k.a. Jerusalem), but it also reviews, albeit less directly, Cameron's own video production. Ankerberg ventures further afield into matters about Gnostic writings and other related topics, as Cameron's video itself also does, but here I am concentrating on what Cameron's and Ankerberg's videos have to say most directly concerning the Talpiot discoveries.

I need to delve into these matters which Cameron's video, featuring primarily the comments and analysis of Simcha Jacobovici and those in his circle, for myself, ""pro"" and ""con"". I would feel more at ease with Cameron's ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"" video, to which Ankerberg responds at times merely in his own too limitingly selective way, if there had been fewer Jews who were involved in Cameron's and Jacobovici's project, since such religionists tend to have very good reasons to desire to undermine Christian claims. That said, those involved in that documentary do not seem to be behaving deviously in that kind of way, at least not obviously, but that is not so easy (if at all possible) to assess on the basis of this video documentary alone.

It is worth noting here that since Amazon-U.S.' sole associated source (not Amazon itself) for Ankerberg's DVD on the subject of the Talpiot tomb being unavailable for delivery to customers here in Canada, that I had to make resort to numerous YouTube videos of various portions from Ankerberg's DVD or from the programme from which the Ankerberg DVD derives (probably together comprising most or all of what is on Ankerberg's own documentary). It takes some effort to ferret out all of these segments from other videos about the Talpilot tomb, but it is well worth the effort. Ankerberg's ministry's own sales arm can provide the material on DVD, on CD, or in transcript form in print, but the fees to send it to our Dominion of Canada are so utterly exorbitant that I had to abandon any hope of obtaining the DVD itself. Thus I have had to content myself with what I can find on the Web of Ankerberg's programming about the Talpiot family tomb.

In print as well as even on the Web, there are numerous well-reasoned textual and video refutations, e.g., on YouTube and elsewhere (Ankerberg's among many) of what the archeological evidence which Cameron, Jacobovici, et al. assess may mean (or not) on their own DVD. An example, just for starters, could be to read young Dillon Burroughts' ""The Jesus Family Tomb Controversy: How the Evidence Falls Short"" (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Nimble Books, 2007, 140 p.; ISBN 978-0-9788138-7-1), as a short book-length discussion, as well as other monographs, articles, and Web resources concerning the Talpiot tomb, including among them, of course, Simcha Jacobovici's own monograph about the Talpiot tomb which, like Burroughs' book, also saw publication in 2007. A good Web article (on the ""Y-Jesus"" site) is ""The Jesus Family Tomb: Fact or Fiction? Jesus' Bones Discovered?"" There is so much more available to those who wish to read or to view further on the controversy. A lot of questions rightly arise with which those involved in the DVD documentary of Cameron and Jacobovici do not deal at all adequately. More research and verification need to be carried out and, indeed, that process has started. The presence of such a radically doubting roguish Catholic scholar as the infamous Domenic Crossan (who once posited an hypothesis that the crucified body of Jesus was thrown out as refuse, which dogs probably devoured), or of any other radical but at least nominally Christian-identifying experts, is less helpful than some might suppose. Ankerberg's videos rightly excoriate ""stacking the deck"" with such scholars, whose bias is always against the reliability of the Holy Scriptures. There should have been more orthodox Christians also involved in the project to pose questions in addition to the sordid likes of Crossan. Ankerberg's video does an excellent job in demolishing the speculations of those who conjecture aloud on Cameron's video about history-of-doctrine and early Christian theology, Christology especially, thoroughly putting to route the speculations of Crossan and of musings on early Christianity that Cameron's and Jacobovici's team cite.

Ankerberg also skillfully casts doubt on the viability of some of the evidence, such as the legibility of the inscription on the ossuary of Jesus Himself. However important such reservations are, however, they are not conclusive, but they are quite significant to take into consideration. It needs to be noted, too, that many of the experts whom the viewer sees and hears speaking on the documentary which Cameron sponsored have stated that they were misrepresented on the Jacobovici-Cameron documentary; others have retracted what they previously had claimed.

Ankerberg's team on video state that the crushing statistical probabilities that the team for Cameron's and Jacobovici's documentary cite in favour of their case are much less than stated there, if the evidence as Ankerberg's team examines it is taken into account. Ankerberg and his guest explain their reasons in some rather convincing detail but they present no mathematically stated alternative to what the recalculated statistical odds would amount. However, there is some brief mention of a few alternative statistical calculations of probability that have been made. Still, that is of limited help, mathematically speaking, to inquirers who might like to compare mutually opposed tallies of probability on the part of Ankerberg's team as they would compare to those of the mathematician whom Simcha Jacobovici consulted. It is clear, from reading about this matter, that discounting and excluding the ossuary of St. James, Jesus' brother, which almost certainly should not have been reckoned among those pertaining to the Talpiot site, very greatly would alter the tally of probabilities that Jacobovici et al. have had calculated on their project's behalf. It is time to state some alternatives, however provisional, in statistical form to cement that difference!

An historical site exists, one that few Roman Catholic, Protestant, or sectarian scholars of the West have investigated since the 20th century and afterwards, and which is very remote, located in an area of high and ruggd terrain in Turkish Kurdistan, quite arduous to gain access to, namely the jointly Christian (apparently Armenian Orthodox) and Islamic holy site of Egil (pronounced ""EH-yil""), which, roughly speaking, is in the mostly rural (and much of it only very sparsely inhabited) area that surrounds the major city of Diyarbakir. Egil had been a pilgrimage destination, of Christians and Muslims alike, in centuries past, but, except on the part of the Muslim population in the vicinity of Dyarbakir and of Egil itself, is little known today. The Turkish government, to avoid potential flooding, due to a large project affecting the Tigris River's flow, relocated Egil's antiquities to the present site near the mountain top of the steep slope that lies facing Egil across a steep chasm (on the holy site's side). The apex of the mountain top is only a short walk away and overlooks, straight down thousands of feet past, over a precipitous cliff, the Tigris River and its banks and, back above and across the divide, a massive fortress from Assyrian times atop the opposite more sloping side of the chasm. The town of Egil had been the site of a very ancient Armenian Orthodox church, which the Turkish government, in its effort to efface the historic Armenian presence within Turkey, destroyed (in the 1960s, as I recall). The holy site of Egil, among other things, purports to be where several of the Holy Women around Jesus are buried (but not His Mother, St. Mary the Blessd Virgin, who, unlike the other women, returned to Jerusalem, present day al-Quds). These are the ladies of Jesus' close personal circle mentioned in the N.T. Gospels, such as St. Joanna (mentioned in St. Luke 8:3), much venerated among the Armenian Orthodox, and those women who stood at the foot of his Cross at the Crucifixion (vid. St. Mark 15:40, St. John 19: 25, which name them, as well as St. Luke 23:49). When Jesus confided His Mother to the care of His belovd male disciple, the only man, apart from a Roman guard, present at the foot of the Cross, that righteous man took them to the remote location, which has become known as the town of Egil, to protect them from persecution.

I have been at this Egil site, during my Lutheran humanitarian mission in Turkish Kurdistan, but, alas, my translators were unable to add so many details to the hearsay and their anecdotes as I would have liked to know further to the explanatory texts variously in Turkish and Arabic, apart from a then still relatively recent Turkish newspaper report (about weirdly frightening physical and psychic phenomena which were purported to occur upon an attempt to open one of the sarcophagi), posted there at the time of my visit there in the mid-1990s, but which were able to confirm to me some of what is there, the most certain being the presence of St. Joanna in one of the ground graves. Their humble graves thus are unlike the two Old Testament figures and a post-Quranic saint or two buried within the sarcophagi in the modest Islamic worship structure itself at Egil. Certainly, that is, if the holy ground graves at Egil include that of St. Mary Magdalene and possibly others reputed to be in the Talpiot tomb, so that the lore about Egil is right, then the reports about the Talpiot tomb, especially as this concerns St. Mary Magdalene, would turn out to be false.

Anyway, Cameron's documentary with Simcha Jacobovici is an interesting one and deserves more than merely instant dismissal. I need to find out more for myself! However, although there is further and better work to be done defending Christian claims (which I believe to be the truth) with apologetics that face head-on those issues about the Talpiot tomb with which Ankerberg and his team do not deal sufficiently or convincingly enough.

Curious to pursue this subject further, I've ordered one book already on the subject from Amazon, since I am finding that the Ankerberg video is rather too shallow and lacking in substance on this issue to be of much help, and I also have put aside some other tomes on the subject to order later on. Ankerberg tends at critical points  often to argue theologically against the evidence of the Talpiot tomb; he does not rise quite fully to the challenge and to the need to address more of the archaeological evidence from antiquity that supports or, hopefully, that may invalidate the claims made for the Talpiot burial site. Ankerberg thus essentially shirks or approches too glibly some aspects, although certainly not all, of the real issue. Christianity is an historical religion and if archaeology, early documentation, and other such evidence seriously can undermines its claims, then the whole structure collapses, no matter how cunningly crafted is the theology that has arisen from it. Thankfully, there is unlikely to be any need for such a collapse, but Ankerberg and others need to continue research and apologetics about these discoveries and developments.

Ankerberg's videos on the subject of the Talpiot tomb do a good job at examining logical implications of and for Christian views and of many of the dubious assumptions which participants express in Cameron's documentary. However, this exercise of logic, in Ankerberg's videos on the subject, is useful only up to a point, after which archaeology and documentary explorations of the question really need to be examined afresh, without taking too much for granted at the outset, or by too patly refusing to examine anew, the entire validity of what the New Testament text (even keeping in mind how solidly historical its writings are), has to say on these matters. This is not to say that the N.T. is defective; it is just that, as always in apologetics, that assumption needs to be opened and to be defended by one side, contested by another, as it pertains to what the N.T. writings have to say about Jesus' burial and resurrection. I am very interested in finding out how others (whose conclusions would be less pre-determined in advance than those of Ankerberg's somewhat ""triumphalising"" apologetics apparently are). I wish to react to ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"" and to the archaeological finds that motivated that video's release on the basis of yet more than these videos provide.

I can think, unaided, of several matters for which the exercise of logic, or the undue reliance upon it divorced from other lines of inquiry, on Ankerberg's part could be quite flawed. Mentioning too many of them in the context of a review would lead to inappropriate length; this already is quite lengthy! To take one example, however, as reasonable as it may seem, as Ankerberg argues, that Jesus' family surely would have maintained a tomb in Nazareth, there is no evidence for such a burial site there of which I am aware, whereas the Talbiot tomb, as possible physical evidence indeed does exist, however inconveniently for apologists such as Ankerberg and those around him. For that matter, the Talpiot tomb is far closer to Bethlehem, the town of origin of Jesus' ancestors, which is situated close to al-Quds (Jerusalem). The identities of those ancestors are traceable, on the family sides both of Joseph and of Mary, for many centuries. How long had the family been living and working in Nazareth, anyway? Long enough really, one has to wonder, to have set up a family tomb there?

There is even more on this aspect of the controversy that bears stating and investigating, but I shall refrain from protracting the like here, except for one further such observation of what should be obvious. Another objection of Ankerberg's team is that some names on the ossuaries in the Talpiot tomb are not listed as among Jesus' forbears and contempories in the family in known geneologies. The obvious problem with this objection is that there would have been family members, past and then-present, in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and perhaps elsewhere in ancient Palestine, such as aunts, uncles, or cousins, who would not be directly among Jesus' most direct ancestors and family if shown on the kind of more uncomplicated ""family tree"" diagramme (such as one would find in combining the simple paternal and maternal family geneologies of Jesus found in two of the N.T. Gospels). Such forbears of Jesus still could have been related to Him within His extended family, and hence likely to be found in a family tomb.

As a Lutheran pastor, of long years in the ministry and of solidly Confessional convictions and a good mind, once cautioned inquirers, ""Keep your powder dry!"" (as in gunpowder, of course) in such a disquieting controversy, which is part of spiritual warfare; face the issues candidly and be prepared for further skirmishes and battles. Ankerberg and his team advise, basically, that same patience and caution, albeit in less colourful and less strong wording as that of the old Lutheran pastor. A Christian, or any other inquirer, for that matter, should not capitulate to the first alarming counter-proposition to Christian claims that comes along, even to one that seems so well grounded, at first glance, as the work of Cameron's team seems to be; nor should one so react to any others which come along after that first experience, for that matter. One must examine such phenomena such as the Jesus family tomb patiently, taking in the evidence and exerting thought to consider it from all angles, before forming some working conclusion, which, in such a profoundly significant matter, would be a stance that would affect the very values by which to live one's very life.

These are preliminary observations. I hope to return to this review, perhaps even several times more than already, after I have learned more, to improve or even, within reason, to amplify it. John Ankerberg has given my Christian faith a boost of confidence, just as I had come so recently to encounter Cameron's and Jacobovici's disturbing and, as it has turned out, not totally reliable findings, tenuously riddled with ""special pleading"" explanations, as they present what the artifacts, to them, seem to attest. While I wish to learn more about the issues that theTalpiot tomb raises, Ankerberg's videos and DVD do provide a strong beginning to do just that.",1444003200,,17657,5.081006549465702
2794875,4,B000OHZJSC,"This very well done feature-length Directors Cut of the Discovery Channel Special is a visual spin-off of the book The Jesus Tomb by Professor Tabor of Chapel Hill at University of North Carolina, who is interviewed extensively during the film.
For those that have read and comprehended his revealing book all this material is reviewed but it is very nice to actually view the places especially the Talpiot site between Jerusalem and Bethlehem where this tomb was uncovered during residential building in 1980.  This story presented maybe the most controversial archaeological find of all time and dangerous to the film creators.
The film attempts to avoid any religious revelations and plays down the fact  the discovered ossuary box in the tomb with the name in Hebrew, Jesus bar Joseph is Jesus the Nazarenes remains and bends the New Testament scriptures that his spirit must have left his earthy body and transcended to heaven.  Most modern day Christians may have difficulty with this Catharian position, seeing the Church murdered over 30,000 individuals during 1209-1243 who possessed this similar idea.
The film does provide a treasure hunt aura which many may appreciate, but it provides a look into the 1st Century Hebrew burials and how the tombs were constructed.

As a Christian minister, this discovery has done nothing to diminish my Christian faith; in fact it has made it stronger and makes Christianity even more exciting to me. To be able to be excited by it, however, one needs to be willing to let go of theology for a moment and look at history instead. There is every rational reason to believe that this is the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth and his family -- to me, that could not be more exciting. It also shows that there were plenty of followers of early Christianity who were likely involved directly with Jesus' family after his crucifixion. To me, this enforces that what Jesus was teaching was very powerful and that whatever happened after his death was transforming enough to make many thousands of people believers in him and his teachings. I believe we are very blessed to have this discovery happen in our lifetimes.",1441152000,6,929,4.602409638554217

Unfortunately, when some people react to new ideas as if they were a personal attack on their deepest faith, their response is only ad hominem, not a quest for deeper and broader data.  That type of critic does not see or experience the thrills and excitements of direct debate, but locks his or her mind in a dark room where one-sided proclamations make only noise, not advancements of any kind.

Simcha Jacobovici's great gift and future legacy is forcing people to think, whether they want to or not, because for those folk, ""thinking"" is unsettling.
For people with an open mind, ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus"" keeps you on the edge of your seat and prevents channel-changing until the very end.  THEN argue Simcha's speculations, theories and conclusions.  Additional information is bound to develop.

I'm eagerly awaiting the second coming video biopic Simcha must be pondering as the heat he generated with this first production converts to light.

Stated before, believe his speculations, theories and conclusions or not, Simcha Jacobovici's persona, personality and achievements over the decades have compelled people worldwide who love archaeology's science and intrigues -- academics, professionals and amateurs -- to THINK new and exciting possibilities about ancient peoples and how they influenced the development of modern societies.

""The Book of Death"" DVD) from ancient time even untill 18 century. Tht's why thr were reformers & martyrs. Conspiracy among priests & king to opress their own people to make more money (eg. amazingdiscoveries.com DVD). Jesus heavily critised Jewish priests for making so many laws & rules even they themself couldn't bear it.

Jesus was given last chance to defent himself (which could give him a freedom) in front of Pontius Pilate but He choosed to be quiet (bible says Pontius is very upset) & surender to His destiny. It's like a father who was tortured & killed by his enemy to tell where is his son/ family hiding but he refused to tell.

Without ""Treat others as yourself want to be treated"" human still live under dark ages/ jungle law. The strong ones opress the weakers.

It was found by a construction crew building an apartment complex in Talpiot, Jerusalem in March of 1980 and sealed by the IAA but rediscovered by Jacobovici and his team in 2005. The ten ossuaries it held were stored in the IAA warehouse, but all the bones were poured out and supposedly given to ultra-orthodox rabbis to be buried somewhere in a hole in the ground. This means that the skeletons of Jesus, his mother, his lover Mary Magdalene and her son, and the brothers of Jesus, James and Yoseh, lie somewhere in an unmarked impromptu grave. Other remarkable historical facts are revealed in this documentary. But why the secrecy? This DVD, shown only once in a simpler version by the Discovery Channel needs to be seen by everyone who knows that it wil have an impact on world religion.

2794981,2,B000OHZJSC,"Experts who have dedicated their lives to study the great myths of Christianity and other religions are scholars who can tell you anything you want to know about the basis for the religion except whether or not it is true.  Experts, scholars and propagandists put together documentaries as if they have some idea about what happened.  As with many other documentaries concerning the origins of Christianity, those who make them are story tellers, many of whom profess that no personal beliefs were expressed in the telling of their story.  If this is true, why put the energy into the creation of a documentary at all?  To label parts of these documentaries as ""recreations"" is absurd.  What are they recreating?  Is it some version of the myth with which the director's or producer's disagreed and had a better idea of what happened 2,000 years ago?  If Jesus existed, it was too long ago for anyone to think they got the story ""right"".  There is nothing remaining that provides us with ""the"" truth.

We all have played the game at one time or another where a very short story or scenario is whispered to the person next to us going around a table and by the time it gets back to us it has changed, sometimes significantly.  Imagine this process going on for at least 100 generations and the person who started the story is long gone.  Where can we make a credible start?  Those who want or need to believe will try to fit these documentaries in with their personal beliefs, and it they do not fit, they will be rejected.  I do not think or believe they really add anything to our knowledge.  Because of this, I can only rate this documentary with 2 stars, just for the effort.",1257897600,2,1678,4.568561872909699

The production values were good, much of it was filmed in the Middle East, many of the actors were apparently Middle Eastern, the ancient scenes weren't filmed in English, and the story reads like a detective piece.
  Now, for the negative part.  This documentary apparenty shook people's faiths for no good reason.  Yes I have watched the documentary.  I also looked at some evidence listed in favor of it printed from the web (including either or both the Discovery Channel's website and the documentarie's).  I have also seen people writing in defense of it.  However, I also looked at numerous views from the opposing side and found out why so many biblical scholars trashed the film's claims.  The term half-truth doesn't do justice to the level of overblown speculation seen in the film.  Frankly, I have better things to do than write a book of my own on its failures.  However, I will provide some resources in case anyone wants to check for themselves.

2795008,5,B000OHZJSC,"I took it for granted that there was something fundamentally flawed and overblown to the story of ""The Lost Tomb of Jesus."" But, actually, this film is a compelling piece of detective work. The filmmakers consult experts and piece together an intriguing thesis. And their admirable tracking down of the original tomb (buried under an apartment complex), makes for compelling filming. The film's thesis is very far from ""airtight,"" but it is, nevertheless, quite interesting.

Usually, if a scientific thesis bypasses the scientific community, and scientific journals, and is laid out before the general public in the form of a popular film or book, you can bet that it probably has very little real evidence to support it. But in this case, it seems that the investigators have succeeded, by making a popular film about the Talpiot tomb, in renewing a debate among Biblical scholars, statisticians, and archaeologists about the nature of the Talpiot tomb.

On the downside, there are elements of sensationalism to the film, and there is no real attempt to cast serious doubt on the filmmakers' thesis. After watching the film, if one wants to follow current academic discussions of the Talpiot tomb, James Tabor's blog is a place to go (Tabor is one of the experts who appears in the film, and he seems inclined to favor the film's thesis). Just Google ""James Tabor"" and ""Jesus Dynasty"" and that should get you to his website.",1209254400,6,1426,4.96234309623431
2795009,2,B000OHZJSC,"I consider myself quite open-minded when it comes to these type of religious historical documentaries. In fact, I am usually thrilled at the idea that someone discovered archaeological evidence of a religious person. Thus, it's strange for this documentary to really turn me off.

I'm mainly annoyed by the narration and structure of the documentary. I think if it wasn't for that, I might have liked it more. Two things bothered me in particular: one was the way the documentary presented its arguments and the other was the omnipresence of the director, Simcha Jacobovici.

The documentary does a very misleading thing. Whenever it encounters a potential piece of evidence that doesn't fit into their argument, they find a way of suggesting that it could potentially fit, and then thereafter refer to it as if they've proven their point. For example, they bring up the problem of ""Mariamne"" - who could she be? Her mention in the Acts of Philip in reference to Mary Magdalene was cited as evidence that this could mean the real Mary Magdalene (never for once questioning the historical validity of the Acts of Philip). Then they show you a dramatic reconstruction of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus, and from that point on, the documentary acts as if they've proven without a doubt that Mariamne is Mary Magdalene. They continue doing that with all the pieces of evidence that don't quite fit, without nothing that these evidence are all linked, so if even one of them is false, then the rest of their case falls apart.

Consider this line of thinking: You want to find out who stole your bicycle. You see a footprint that belongs to a shoe that maybe Billy wore, and maybe he was in your neighborhood even though he lives an hour away, and maybe his bicycle broke down which is why he needed yours, and maybe he liked your bicycle among all the others in the neighborhood. Well, if any one of these ""maybe's"" are false, your case falls apart.

I know they try to do the statistical argument, but what does 1 in 60,000 mean? It sounds like a huge possibility but they never to bother elaborating on that.

The other thing, and perhaps the most annoying thing, about the documentary is Simcha Jacobovici, who comes across as biased as Michael Moore (whom, incidentally, I actually like). His bias is so obvious that it puts into question the entire construction of the project, including how the film was edited, who and what did they leave out, and so on.

As I said, I would really like to believe the arguments in this documentary, and some of it is quite convincing, but the flawed line of thinking and the bias of the director makes it very suspect. There was some good production values, but other than that, it was a poorly conceived project on a potentially fascinating find.",1207958400,55,2788,4.702868852459017

Anyone who enjoys investigative documentaries will certainly enjoy THIS DVD.

2795013,5,B000OHZJSC,"Let me start this review with a recap of what we know from the DVD.  We found the tomb of a person named Jesus who had a father named Joseph.  We have a Maria, a Miriamne, a Jose and a Matthew.  So, having stated that, have we found the tomb of the Historical Jesus?  We feel we know what happened to the Biblical Jesus based on the Gospels.  Based on this, is it possible to find a Jesus tomb?  Granted, it does not say ""Jesus, son of Joesph, from Nazereth"" on the ossuary.  As one of the experts comments in the show (paraphrased) ""...If we find the bones of Jesus of Nazereth, does that destroy faith in Christianity?  It does not destroy MY faith.  I leave what happens to bodies after they die to God.""  That is also my take on this.  If we can prove that this is the Historical Jesus' body, it does not ruin my faith.  It just offers a little more faith that this person who has numerous texts actually set foot on earth and said all these wonderful things.  As far as those who may say, ""well if there is a body then he could not have resurrected"", why not?  We all go under the assumption he physically rose from the dead and went human body and all to heaven.  He could have done that, why not?  He's the Son of God after all.  It could also have been a strictly spiritual resurrection.  Again, he's the Son of God, if his spirit body went to heaven and He wanted to show himself to his disciples to prove he ""resurrected"", he could do that as well and even let the disciples touch him.
Of course it is also possible that Jesus lived and died, said and did most of these wonderful things the Gospels attribute to him, then when they committed story to paper, they embellished it to make him a God-like being.
In the end, I don't know whether this is the tomb of the Historical Jesus or not.  And this is not totally set out to prove one way or the other.  What Simcha is trying to do, from my opinion, is set the evidence in front of the viewer and let the viewer decide if we found the tomb of Jesus of Nazereth or if we just found the biggest coincidence in recorded history. Either way, it is a great show.",1189296000,40,2118,4.144607843137255

Also, having now watched several episodes of 'The Naked Archaeologist' which follow the archaeological exploits of Simcha Jacobovici (same individual who leads the expedition on the Talpoit tomb), I must say that I am not at all impressed by his 'fly by the seat of his pants' methods for diliniating archaeological data.

2795017,5,B000OHZJSC,"By the title of this film, one expects controversy, so I should start of by saying that I am not devoutly religious in any way shape or form.  I never went to Sunday school, am not an expert in the Bible or in the history of the world around the time of Christ.  I watched this DVD purely out of interest, and I came away very impressed with it.

This movie examines the contents of a tomb accidentally discovered in Jerusalem in 1980 by construction workers.  Inside the tomb were 10 ossuaries, and six of them were inscribed with names, supposedly, from Jesus Christ's family.  They include Maria (Virgin Mary), Jesus son of Joseph (Jesus Christ), Mariamne (Mary Magdelene), Matthew (brother of Jesus), Jose (another brother of Jesus), and Judah (son of Jesus).  Yes, that's right, this movie hints that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had a son named Judah.  The movie takes pains to show how these names were read, and interpreted to correlate with names from the Bible.  The movie also shows how the relationship between some of the names changes depending on which part of the Bible one is reading.  Most importantly, the movie provides arguments as to why its conclusions are not supported by mainstream Western theology; i.e. why Mary Magdelene could have been Jesus's wife, yet she is never mentioned as such in the Bible.

External sources are cited, such as ancient literary works.  The movie is told like a detective story, with the filmaker leading the way as principle investigator.  Many of the clues are found real time with the camera taping it the entire time.  The movie follows scientists as they examine evidence such as sediments on the ossuaries, ancient texts, maps and drawings, etc...  The movie even has a professional statistician go through the odds of another family at that time having the same set of names and being buried together.  The point of the movie is that we, humans, have found the tomb of Jesus Christ and his family members, and that he had fathered a son with Mary Magdalene.

The movie and the special features include interviews with many Biblical experts, archaelogists, forensic experts, historians, linguists, and even religious officials from multiple countries and institutions.  All are given lots of time to voice their doubts, opinions, and biases as to the evidence and the conclusions.

There are several questions that the movie does not address, and should have in order to improve its believability.  First, what about the other ossuaries?  Ten were found in the tomb, but only six are examined as part of this movie.  Second, this viewer assumes that bones were found in all 10 ossuaries.  Why was DNA evidence not extracted from all 10?  Third, the movie producers should have tried and dated the age of death for all 10 skeletons, and see if these ages corresponded to what is in the Bible.  Fourth and last, the movie, or one of the extra features, should have spent some time showing how the tomb was dated to about 0 (Zero) AD.  But even with these drawbacks, this was a great movie.  I consider it as one of the best documentaries to have been released this decade.  The narration is great, the interviews seem frank, engaging and unscripted, the facts presented are convincing, and the pacing of the movie was perfect.  Facts were presented like a well-crafted lawyer's argument.  Overall, I highly recommend this movie.",1181520000,9,3382,4.83304347826087

8184936,4,B000OHZJSC,"Before viewing this film, I was skeptical about the claims I suspected it would make. After all, names like Jesus, Mary, Joseph, etc were commonplace in first century Israel. But as the movie points out, it is the conjunction of the names and the unique spelling of some of the names as well as other factors that make the likelihood of this ossuary site being the burial site of someone other than the Jesus of Gospels remote. One statistician places the odds at 1 out of 30,000 that the site isn't the burial site of Jesus of the Gospels.

My only issue with the film is that it tries to make the case that if the burial site is the burial site of Jesus of the Gospels, then no major doctrine of Christianity is threatened. It just means that Jesus' resurrection was spiritual and not physical. That's unfortunate and rather cowardly because the bone fragments of Jesus mean that no resurrection occurred at all. But the good news is that evidence arguably lays to rest the skepticism, vogue in some circles, about the existence of the ""Jesus"" mentioned in the Gospels.
