8375098,3,B002NKMCXI,"""Assassination"" a 1967 Eurospy film filmed on location in the U.S. and Hungary by Italians and Cinecitta (perhaps once again the man credited as director is really an Italian with an Americanized name ""Hal Brady"") is mostly problematic because of the lead actor, Henry Silva has no charisma except as the ""assassin"" completely lacking humor. The original source of this Sinister Cinema output is much improved over a lot of their product making for good viewing, but without any relief, the film becomes rather tiresome as useless plot developments become trite.  As one other reviewer termed it ""drivel"" ""Assassination"" sadly has an otherwise pretty good script but ultimately does not deliver that intangible something to make it a worthwhile purchase.  Evelyn Stewart becomes like Margaret Lee a name to watch for in European cinema as she is quite good.  The music by Robby Poitevin is derivative of other music but otherwise pretty good. The producers at Cinegai-Jolly Films have scored better. Great Technicolor and Techniscope.",1338854400,,1034,5.254545454545455
8375099,3,B002NKMCXI,"[ASSASSINATION -(1967)- Widescreen presentation - Directed by Hal Brady]  Interesting, slightly above-average Eurospy offering from Italy starring the great character actor Henry Silva (The Manchurian Candidate) - it's too bad his looks prohibited him from better roles and wider recognition, but he looks too much like a villain to be cast as anything else - as an actor, he has a face for radio...

Death-row inmate John Chandler (Silva), his last murder charge appeal denied, is visited by his wife Barbara (the always luscious Evelyn Stewart aka Ida Galli) for the last time, and he promptly throws her out, screaming ""Take a good long, last look - now get out!"" He's then taken for his 'Dead Man Walk', strapped to the big chair and we witness the grisly details as the lights dim from excessive voltage use. Brrr...

At the reading of the will, his wife is left a pittance and the house and its entire contents are left to his brother - his wife knew no such brother even existed. As is somewhat typical in 60's spy yarns, Johnny boy didn't meet his maker in the high chair after all, he's being utilized for a mission, being sent back to Barbara as Phillip, a long-lost brother from Capetown, Africa, who's a ringer for the newly departed John. Needless to say, Barbara's aghast.

There's a wild nightclub scene with go-go girls aplenty, quite a few ""Groovy"" and ""Baby""'s thrown about before the guns come out to play. Some alleyway fisticuffs, another bar peppered with mob guys and scantily-clad servers, a funeral ceremony for dear departed John, a few more espionage clichs and a 60's fashion show that's tre chic, and no one is who they appear to be. All spy flicks should come with score cards.

Phillip takes a flight to Hamburg only to find Barbara's already there, a motorcycle encounter and a brutal beat-down with the Aryan equivalent of 'The Wild Ones' ensues, some target practice at a 'Man From U.N.C.L.E.' (or possibly T.H.R.U.S.H.) facility takes place, and (finally) some interesting facts are exchanged before Phillip exposes himself to Barbara (no, no, not that way) and we find out a flight of world delegates is endangered by the Aryan cult.

Will Phillip/John save the day to live happily ever after with Barbara? Will the delegates survive the deadly threat? Will Phillip get found out by his new friends who want to upset world order? Will the bad guys escape in a helicopter for a sequel? Are you still caring about any of this drivel? All joking aside, the ending served up is a fine one and brings decent closure to this 'Assassination'. Fans of 60's Eurospy flicks might not see this as essential but should find this one enjoyable and entertaining in spite of the fact that Evelyn Stewart keeps her clothes on throughout.
A solid 3 1/2 stars.",1312416000,,2778,4.777083333333334
8375100,4,B002NKMCXI,"This is a first rate version of this 1967 movie,and the picture as well as the soundquality is stunning!(worth mentioning since Sinister cinema seldom has a chance to make transfers like this one, and is often critisised for their products) Legendary Henry Silva, known mostly for his superb bad guy parts, here has a rare, ordinary guy (Well, not exactly..) starring role, as an american agent with a death sentence over his head, who gets a second chanse taking over his brothers identity, in order to kill an important politician. This is a diffrent and exciting movie that looks fantastic. Its well made in every department, and it has a really groovy soundtrack! The story takes place mostly in the U.S and Germany, but its an italian production also starring the talanted and beutiful ""Evelyn Stewart"" (Ida Galli)
From Jolly film productions, who also produced ""A Fistful of dollars"" and ""Grand slam"" They made some great movies, and this is one of them! Strongly recomended!!!",1287360000,6,983,4.963636363636364
