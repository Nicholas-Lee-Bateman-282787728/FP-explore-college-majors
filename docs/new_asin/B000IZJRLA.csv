8325237,1,B000IZJRLA,"My experience with this ""manufactured on demand"" dvd was: (1)  the disc stopped playing after 1hr and 15mins and would not play again until 10 mins further on into the movie; (2) the 'subtitle' function, although it worked, was really hit and miss; (3) the soundtrack was full of background hissing; (4) the visual quality was really really poor.

I am returning this disc for a refund and will not buy another ""manufactured on demand"" disc again.",1425081600,,447,4.792207792207792
