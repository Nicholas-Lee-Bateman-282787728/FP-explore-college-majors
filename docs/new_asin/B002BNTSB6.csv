The other reviewers criticized the DVD menu system and overall theme/production. The menus weren't a problem for me, you just have to hit the Skip or fast-forward on your DVD remote, then play 3 times to get past all the commercial intro stuff). It is a bit unusual, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.

This is not glamours video, rather a traditional practice with Indian students (one male, one female) in a small, simple studio. The setting consists of bright blue floors, bright yellow mat, and bright orange wall displays showing various stick-figure graphic yoga postures. The 2 students wear simple orange short sleeve shirts with dark blue pants. I love the practice it's self and it reminds me of ""Yin Yoga"" in that it is some-what passive by hold the pose, reflecting within, and connecting your mind with your body. It's a short enough practice that it doesn't take a big chuck of your time and is easily completed in the morning or evening.

Once you get to the main menu, you have two choices:

1. How to perform the Asanas.
This section has a menu selection for each of the postures in the ""Real Time Yoga Session, plus a section about meditation. This section helps to explain the postures if you have never done yoga before or need a refresher. This section will help you to actually understand the individual postures. The individual segments provide some rather interesting perspective of each of the postures. At first it seemed rather dramatic, but it really is helpful for explaining the background, benefits, and how to get into the posture. It explains how it affects the digestive system. Since the actual session does not explain verbally, it's very helpful that they included this section where you can practice each posture.

2. The Real Time Yoga Session. I LOVE this practice mainly because it does not include any verbal instruction. Each posture is first shown with the Sanskrit name and a stick-figure illustration, then a real person demonstrates how to get into the posture, then a bell rings to begin the hold of the pose. Each pose is held for 1-2 or more minutes, then the bell rings again. At first the bell startled me, but once I got used to it (and turned the volume down) I really enjoyed this non-verbal practice. There is no distraction of verbal cues and I was able to focus more on myself and my practice than the television screen. Once you go thru it a few times, you barely have to lookup to follow the sequencing..

I will use this DVD for years to come and follow the practice and re-play the verbal instruction portions as well.

Please check out my yoga DVD reviews on the other 2 in the series. Highly recommended as a different format than most Yoga DVD's on Amazon!  Namaste'",1356307200,4,3273,5.222857142857142
8361667,1,B002BNTSB6,This is more or less a beginning yoga cd with the navigation of this DVD so horrible that you won't want to use it.,1322956800,2,115,3.8333333333333335
8361668,2,B002BNTSB6,"I bought this DVD and the Back and Spine DVD by the same company, and I wish I had not.

First, the navigation on these DVD's is the worst I have ever seen. There is no menu at the beginning, and no index of exercise. You only option is to push play. Then you get a long spiel about how wonderful yoga is, and you only option is to FF through it. There are also some text slides that you have to go through by hitting the right arrow and then enter, several times. If you do this all correctly you will be taken to a two option menu. If you didn't do it correctly, or tried to use the menu, prev, or next buttons, you'll end up having to start the whole process over.  At the two option menu you are given the choice of viewing the asanas, or doing the real-time workout.  There is no instruction during the actual workout, so you will need to view the asanas if you want instructions.

Now, I had expected there to be specific instruction and care given to the body parts mentioned in the titles, but there is not. What you get is a set of asanas, and instructions on how to do them. From having both DVD's, it is clear that they filmed each asana once and just insert that part into each DVD where needed. So, basically, the same asana on each DVD is the same clip. It appears that the idea was to take the stock footage of the individual asanas and put them together in a group that will help strengthen certain body parts. The listing of the asanas is a muddled mess.  They are listed only by there Sanskrit names, and the longer names push over the next column so the alignment is practically non existent. There's no real order to it, and it doesn't remember you spot so there's no orderly way to view them. You have to scroll back up to where you left off...if you can remember the Sanskrit name and find it in that jumble of names. There are more asanas on this DVD than on the Back and Spine DVD, so the list is much worse. There are instructions on how to do the asanas, which in general is not too bad, but this is an Indian made DVD, filmed in India, using young native Indian people who have probably been doing these asanas for a good many years. There is no consideration given to the fact that many people will not be nearly that flexible, or that the reason they bought the DVD was because the body parts in question may be injured in some way. In other words, you really need to be pretty flexible and uninjured to begin with. No special instructions are given for the body parts listed in the title.  It's all generic.

As for the workout itself, that is just the poses held for a certain length of time, and when it's done, the next asana is spliced in from the generic pool.  There are no instructions, or talking of any kind. This may be good for some people, but if you have knee or hip problems and were hoping for special instructions to help you do the poses you won't find any on these DVD's. I'm sure healthy, flexible people will improve their leg and knee strength and flexibility, but even then, the navigation of this DVD would probably drive many people crazy. Oh, and if you want to skip to the next asana, you have to use FF. Trying to use the Next button will take you to the end of the DVD. It's almost as bad as using a VCR.

For those that have knee problems, I have found the book ""Yoga for Healthy Knees"" very helpful.",1281052800,10,3359,4.195348837209302
