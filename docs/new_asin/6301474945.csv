7813230,5,6301474945,"AWESOME cheese in this Japanese/American Sci-Fi monster flick ! If you love Godzilla then Guilala will put you over the edge. The movie takes a while to get going, the acting is typically horrible & the story line is sketchy but once it gets on track its a CLASSIC as good as any early ToHo released movie out there ! Once the monster Guilala emerges and escapes from this tiny orb that was found clogging up the spaceships exhaust and he starts wolfing down energy sources and destroying city after city the fun really begins. I won't give this movie away, all I can say is buy this movie and watch away ! I give it 5 stars so be rest assured you won't be sorry purchasing this flick !",1231632000,2,686,4.2846153846153845
7813231,5,6301474945,"If you like/love monster movies and have a sense of humor this movie is an absolute must! I happen to think most Godzilla movies are well made. True, I first saw them as a (small) child and as such they presented an awesome spectacle to me from that perspective/point of view but this movie is so bad it's good! Even X's attacks are hysterical! Godzilla's movements/attacks at least looked like a lumbering, menacing dinosaur's (especially in the 50's, 60's, and early 70's); X's rampages truly look like a two year old throwing  temper tantrums or a toddler pitching a fit. The best part was the jet plane attack on X. I won't give it away but it had my seven year old nephew and even my three year old niece in hysterics. Nuff said.",1225670400,,734,4.477611940298507

7813233,1,6301474945,"I watched this film the other day,and well i know that Godzilla was bad,but this is far worse. The story is so much beyond anything i have seen before. Once the monster is first seen,you can't help but laugh. It looks like a overgrown green budgie with red eyes,and wires on the top of it's head. Most people think that Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst film ever,but watch this and you will change your mind. I dare you to watch it. If anybody can think of a worse film than this,then i want to know.",995587200,2,504,4.153061224489796
