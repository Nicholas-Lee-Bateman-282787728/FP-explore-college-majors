3893660,4,B002BFBAWE,My daughter and grandaughter said they thought it was a great movie. They did say they would watch it again for sure.,1265241600,,117,4.363636363636363
3893661,1,B002BFBAWE,"Sneaky Disney marketing strikes again!!  While my daughter enjoys the show, we were very disappointed to purchase this and find that it only contained 4 episodes...far from a whole season, not even a half season!

To be fair, the amazon reviews here do make that clear.  Unfortunately, we bought the DVD set in a retail store.  And looking just at the package it was FAR from clear that ""Volume 1"" was not only NOT a ""Season 1"" compilation, but that it was a measly 4 episodes!  We could have bought any 4 individual episodes on iTunes for less (and forget about the measly ""extras""!)

So, 4 stars for the show (my daughter would say, although I wouldn't rate it quite as high as an adult), but 0 stars for the DVD packaging.",1252108800,14,725,4.454545454545454
3893662,5,B002BFBAWE,"The young stars of Sonny with a Chance don't necessarily know the classic TV they are channeling -- The Dick Van Dyke Show, Your Show of Shows -- but perhaps the creatives behind the show do, because of all the Disney Channel shows, this is probably has the most appeal to all ages, including those who might not look twice at tween comedies.

Yes, it can be silly, but the silliness is inspired. As I learned when I interviewed several cast members, there's a chemistry between them and a junior Mary Tyler Moore/Jack Benny attitude evidenced by Demi Lovato's willingness to play the ""straight man"" and allow her costars to share the jokes.

The bonus episode, ""Sonny in the Middle,"" is a good example, in which the two comic costars (Brandon Smith and Doug Brochu) have a fight and Demi's Sonny character replaces them as pals. it's the oldest gag in the book -- the sandwich chef is given gag names to call over the loudspeaker, but it's surefire and Lovato plays it with skillful timing.

This DVD contains four episodes, including the pilot, as well as Lovato's screen test. Apparently she was testing for this show and Camp Rock came along before she was given the series lead. Not surprising when you consider how many months Miley Cyrus had to test and re-test for Hannah Montana.

Sonny With a Chance is two ""shows within a show:"" the sketch comedy ""So Random,"" and the wonderfully overwrought teen drama, ""McKenzie Falls,"" starring the show's rival/love interest Stirling Knight, another young actor with comic skill beyond his years.

It will be interesting to see how this show develops over the next few seasons, between the three premises and the cast, which by the way, includes a Richard Deacon ""Mel Cooley"" type producer!",1251936000,,1738,4.78
3893663,5,B002BFBAWE,"From the writer and producer who has worked on popular animated titles such as ""The Fairly Odd Parents"", ""Danny Phantom"" and ""Family Guy"" comes the Disney Channel series ""Sonny with a Chance"" starring pop star Demi Lovato.

The series started airing on February 2009 and I have to admit that among the Disney Channel shows that I have watched with my son, ""Sonny with a Chance"" is actually quite enjoyable and highly entertaining.

The series revolves around an Internet star named Sonny Munroe (Demi Lovato) who is from Wisconsin.  She and her mother Connie (Nancy McKeon, ""Facts of Life"") move to Hollywood for Sonny's first major television role, to be part of the popular sketch comedy show ""So Random!"".  Joining her on the show is the diva Tawni Hart (Tiffany Thornton), the comedic best friends Nico (Brandon Smith) and Grady (Doug Brochu) and the youngest member of the group, and also quite odd at times, Zora (Alllisyn Ashley Arm).  Along with the show's producer Marshall Pike (Michael Kostroff), the group comes up ideas for their sketch show for the week and trying to maintain their grades in school.

But all is not easy for Sonny, which she soon discovers.  Her castmate Tawni who likes all the attention to her self is not so thrilled she has to share the show with another girl and also, the cast of the teen drama ""Mackenzie Falls"" led by actor and teen hearthtrob Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight) have been at war with the cast of ""So Random!"".  Testing Sonny's allegiance since she is a big fan of Chad but now part of a show despised by him and his castmates.

For ""Sonny with a Chance: Sonny's Big Break Vol. 1', the series comes with the following episodes which are not in broadcast or production order.  Here are spoiler-less summaries:

  * EPISODE 1 - SKETCHY BEGINNINGS - Sonny joins the cast of ""So Random!"" and meets her castmates for the first time.
  * EPISODE 2 - WEST COAST STORY - Sonny meets actor Chad Dylan Cooper (who she admires) of the teenage drama ""MacKenzie Falls"" but quickly learns of the rivalry between the cast of ""So Random!"" and ""MacKenzie Falls"".
  * EPISODE 5 - CHEATER GIRLS - Sonny and Tawni have a great idea for a sketch for ""So Random!"" but because of Sonny's bad grade in a class, she is pulled off the show unless she shows improvement.
  * EPISODE 3 - SONNY AT THE FALLS - Chad Dylan Cooper and the cast of ""MacKenzie Falls"" come up with an idea to get back at ""So Random!"" by causing friction with Sonny and her castmates.

""Sonny's Big Break Vol. 1' also comes with a bonus episode:

  * UNAIRED EPISODE - SONNY IN THE MIDDLE - Sonny buys Nico and Grady a video game chair as a present for their birthday but the guys get into an argument over who will play in the chair that their friendship becomes torn and each of them look towards Sonny to be their new best friend.  As of this time, this episode is only on this DVD and has only been shown on Delta flights and has not aired on television yet.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Sonny with a Chance: Sonny's Big Break Vol. 1' is presented in full screen (1:33:1) and audio is presented in Dolby Digital Stereo Sound (and also includes the Spanish language track).  Subtitles are in Spanish.

It's important to note that ""Sonny with a Chance"" is the first Disney Channel Original Series to be shot and aired in High Definition.  It would be great to see Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment possibly release the whole series on Blu-ray in the near future.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Sonny with a Chance: Sonny's Big Break Vol. 1' includes the following special features:

  *
  * A BONUS EPISODE - The DVD comes with an episode titled ""Sonny in the Middle"".
  * Demi's Big Break - (3:28) Before Demi Lovato did ""Camp Rock"" and became a big pop star, she auditioned for ""Sonny with a Chance"" in July 2007.  This clip features Demi auditioning for the role.
  * Mackenzie Falls Season Finale Cliffhanger - (7:03) Literally the cliffhanger finale starring Chad Dylan Cooper and fellow cast members.
  * Dylan & Cole Sprouse: Blu-ray is Suite - (5:57) A promotion for Disney's Blu-ray featuring the Sprouse twins and Kim Rhodes (who plays their mother Carey on their show).

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first watched ""Sonny with a Chance"", I was actually quite impressed.  Personally, the whole show based around a sketch comedy was quite intriguing, especially since I grew up watching shows like ""You Can't Do that on Television"" and it helps that one of the executive producer's for the show also was involved with a real sketch comedy show ""All That"".  The characters are fun and wacky and the rivalry with another teen show also makes up for interesting storylines for the show.

So, as an adult watching this comedy series, I was highly entertained.  As for children, my son absolutely loves the show and the fact that the cast has many hilarious moments definitely keeps the series fun and entertaining from beginning to end.

For the most part, I think fans of ""Sonny with a Chance"" or the stars of the show will enjoy the DVD.  If I had one thing to nitpick, its the fact that other DVD releases include two bonus episodes, for this release, you only get one.

But other than that, I really enjoyed the series and of the majority of the teen or children comedy shows that I have watched and reviewed, ""Sonny with a Chance"" is high on my list for recommendation!

Parents looking for a safe and hilarious show for their  children or fans of Demi Lovato or the cast members of the show, ""Sonny with a Chance: Sonny's Big Break Vol. 1' is highly recommended!",1251504000,17,5556,4.586802030456853
3893664,5,B002BFBAWE,"I seen the series, I recommend people watching this show on the air.  This show reminds me of All That, what the characters are like on and off the air.  Sonny Monroe reminds me of Amanda Bynes of So Random.  Nico and Grady are like Drake Bell and Josh Peck of so Random.  Zora reminds me of Miranda Cosgrove of So Random. Tawny is like the London Tipton and Alex Russo in So Random. So Random is like between the Amanda Show and ALl That on Nickelodeon.  Sonny with a chance reminds of iCarly and Cake TV.  Mackenzie Falls is Gossip Girl and Dawson's Creek all at once.  Chad Corey Dylan Cooper is the atangionist of the show, his character reminds me of Steve Stifler of Mackenzie Falls.  Demi Lovato did an excellent job in this show, she has the greatest resemblance of The House Bunny Emma Stone and Michelle Monaghan.",1248652800,,823,4.403973509933775
3893665,5,B002BFBAWE,"This is my favorite Disney Channel show in a long time. The cast is great at playing their characters; especially Demi Lovato, Sterling Knight, and Tiffany Thornton. I have to say the love/hate relationship between Sonny and Chad alone makes this show worthwile and almost gives it a means to reach an adult audience. I'll definitely be buying the dvd.",1246406400,19,352,4.883333333333334
