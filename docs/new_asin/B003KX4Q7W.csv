8399043,5,B003KX4Q7W,"There's this place in NY's Central Park called Strawberry Fields - done up in honor of John Lennon, who lived nearby with Yoko. And people come every day year round. Just to be there, to sing, even create art. Just to Imagine. Another anniversary of John's birthday or assassination or whatever just happened. And tears flow, just like kids today go through over Kurt Cobain.  There's this homeless guy (or, more politically correct, coop-challenged) who basically runs the little park. Is he Sergeant Pepper? Is his wife Eleanor Rigby? Who knows, but he is a walking encyclopedia of Beatle-lore, and gives tours and lectures and gets singers going and does art. John would have loved him. And you will too - in this short documentary we meet the Mayor of Strawberry Fields and all his subjects. If you care about the Beatles or John, I'd definitely suggest this flick.",1295913600,,869,4.832214765100671
8399044,5,B003KX4Q7W,I've seen this documentary many times and it always seems to reveal something new.  Great film to watch with groups of people-- the rawness and beauty that unfolds ends up prompting a lot of discussion afterward.

8399045,5,B003KX4Q7W,"The Mayor of Strawberry Fields is a trip!  Truly a unique look into a disregarded microcosm through the eyes of Gary, a man who has mastered the art of living in the now.  The soundtrack fits perfectly.",1282867200,,202,4.4324324324324325
8399046,5,B003KX4Q7W,"Not just any Beatles fan, but any music fan.  ""The Mayor"" brings together images from one of NYC's most famous landmarks, and it is done in a way that honors Lennon, Gary and Central Park perfectly.  Torre has an incredible future ahead of him, so take the opportunity to get in on the ground floor.",1282867200,,299,4.418181818181818
8399047,5,B003KX4Q7W,"I was completely blown away by this sleeper of a documentary.  A brilliant piece of filmmaking that cuts to the core of art, homelessness and music.  It will make you question you're own ideas, beliefs and preconceptions.  A definite must-see.",1282780800,,243,5.025
8399048,4,B003KX4Q7W,"It was wonderful that so many artistic expressions were compiled into one movie. Great music, amazing directing, John Lennon's story and a homeless guy named Gary creating masterpieces with day old flowers. Just a very unique story that made me think what I felt art was....",1282608000,,274,4.978260869565218
8399049,4,B003KX4Q7W,I found the character in this film quite interesting and heart warming. The music was also great,1282176000,,96,4.705882352941177
8399050,4,B003KX4Q7W,Very interesting film about a quirky character and his dedication to serving the memory of John Lennon's 'Imagine' memorial with his own style of artistic commitment on a daily basis.  This is made even more intriguing due to the fact that Gary is homeless and managing his own struggles to survive in New York's Central Park every day.  Great music too!!,1281484800,4,355,4.80327868852459
