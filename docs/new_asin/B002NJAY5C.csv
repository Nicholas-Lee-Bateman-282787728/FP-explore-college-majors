It seems like the directors have tried to squeeze as many dramatical moments as possible into the last part (without further thought), which makes me give the drama only 4 stars. But it is definetely worth watching for its good story developement through most of the episodes, its funny parts and its sad parts.",1386979200,,431,4.6103896103896105
8375073,5,B002NJAY5C,"I really enjoyed this drama, it was very romantic and sweet. I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the wig Rainie Yang was wearing, it was weird and distracting. Jiro Wang made up for it though, I thought he was great in this drama, quite different from his role in MoMo Love. This role brought out his acting skills more and his character is what really made the show for me. He could easily go between the over the top arrogant superstar to sweet, genuine, and down to earth.

I found Rainie's character to be kind of blah, if it wasn't for Rainie playing it I would have not liked the character much at all. Her character is a bit of a Debbie downer and self sabotages her life, like she feels she is not worthy of her own happiness. Luckily Jiro's character is persistent.

This drama is enjoyable and in my opinion a must watch for any Jiro Wang fan. It is one I actually want to buy and add to my own collection, but search it watch it on one of the many Asian drama sites before investing in it.",1331164800,,1013,4.216494845360825
