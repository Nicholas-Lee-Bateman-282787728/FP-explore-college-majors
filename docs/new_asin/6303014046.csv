531613,1,6303014046,"Clark Gable was sure lucky that this mess of a movie didn't end his career, being that it was his first venture after returning from active duty in WWII.  The main trouble with the movie is his attitude; for some reason, Metro tried to revive the style of the younger carefree Gable in this film, the sort of fellow he was in ""It Happened One Night""--even Metro's memory was faulty, because that persona had already been replaced by the mature man of 1939' ""Gone with the Wind"". Here, he's just too old and had been through too much in real life (the war and the earlier death of his wife Carole Lomabard) to cavort around like he does in the movie, and with Greer Garson no less!  I don't understand why the studio, having taken such pains to shape her image as a gentlewoman, had her buffooning around either. Check out the better post-war Gable of ""Homecoming"" and ""The Hucksters"", and leave ""Adventure"" on the shelf.",995760000,6,920,4.536144578313253
531614,5,6303014046,"...and neither did Leonard Maltin. This movie is better with each passing year... I think it is a pre-noir, pre-""reality"" - psychological drama of intense beauty. Clark Gable stars as a staunchly confirmed sea dog, crew leader (called a bos'n) and womanizer who is totally unprepared to meet Greer Garson's character, who forever changes his vision of what is possible in finding love with a woman. Academy Award winner, and beloved character actor Thomas Mitchell (""Uncle Billy"" in ""It's A Wonderful Life (1946)"") plays his too-sensitive-for-this-world sidekick, who becomes Gable's conscience, but at a price. The script of this drama is lyrically sublime, subtle and quite deep. The fire between the stars is evident and haunting. True 'soul-mate' love is the overt theme of this movie. Existence, conscience, and facing the pain and limits of life, so that you may truly pass into adulthood, are more themes explored here. I view this film regularly once a year and am always inspired by its deep message and raw powerful performances. This isn't your stock Gable. This is a bittersweet post-war love poem.(Really! E. B. Browning is quoted to great effect!) ***Gable's ""Harry Patterson"" has seen tragedy and loss (as had Gable himself, recently losing the love of his life, wife Carole Lombard).  He is made restless in search of ""it"" which he believes only exists in the danger and perils of sea voyaging. He is sickened by the way shipwrecked people, alive and on edge, once resued, quickly become bored and lose that passionate awareness of their own lives.  He is searching for that life where he stays excited and in the passionate present (probably true of many returning war soldiers in 1945). ***In Garson's ""Emily Sears"" he sees ""it"" for the first time in a woman's eyes. He is intrigued by her equivalent strength and wit, and simultaeously threatened by the risk of pain in losing her. Their love develops as a series of intense battles. She sees a ""caged animal"" and for the first time a man she might really respect, even though she feels he needs to be reached through all of his rebellion...and rescued.  His actions are escapist (and make great movie scenes)...but sailing away to forget his new ""queen,"" he finds things have changed and we know, as do the other characters, that it is the end of his former life ...even if he doesn't. ""Emily"" bravely allows ""Harry"" to figure it out for himself. She doesn't demand any change in him, instead she sends him off to find ""it"" and risks being without the man that she loves for the rest of her life. Her majesty the queen of MGM, Greer Garson, has never been lovelier. ***Joan Blondel is a juicy, ripe 'tomato'. ***Lina Romay makes an incredible ""girl in distant port"" and even sings a bit! ***Thomas Mitchell is the stand out support. He plays Mudge, the soul and conscience of the free spirited Gable and perhaps of the whole film. He brilliantly helps unite a lost sailor & seeker with what his heart truely seeks.  Watch this film and let it be poetry... just let it play as you marvel at the writing and the actors' eyes.  I predict that this movie is about to be rediscovered in a big way.

Leonard Maltin is right as usual! I only wished I'd checked his guide before wasting two hours out of my life. This one sinks under it's own weight! A running time of just over 2 hours doesn't help. Gable is such an unsympathetic jerk in this role that it's hard to relate to him, hard to understand why any sane and intelligent woman like the Garson character would want to put up with him over ten minutes. The ending is simplistic, silly and unbelievable and why the film is called ""Adventure"" is beyond me. There is about as much ""adventure"" here as in a Three Stooges short...which by the way would be much more entertaining! A major misfire from MGM!

531697,2,6303014046,"While liking both Gable and Garson immensely, this movie is a chore to get through.  The character that is more of a ""caricature"" of Gable is so unlikable that you spend most of the film rooting for Garson to wake up and run away from him.  Sure it plays on the good girl attracted to bad boy formula, but Gable's character is written to be so miserable that his eventual ""excuse"" scene for being such a jerk doesn't cut it.  Garson is as usual very sincere in her portrayal but comes off as a dumb character for seeing anything in Gable's lowlife personality.  Thomas Mitchell does some solid supporting work but Joan Blondell is over the top in her part most of the film.  I wanted to like this one, but it is clearly near the bottom of both Gable & Garson's work.  This being Gable's return role after the war and losing a wife you wonder whether he just wanted to portray a guy who didn't give a darn about anything including the quality of his acting (see drunk scenes).  If that was his goal, he was on target.",1376352000,2,1016,4.315789473684211

There's about 25 minutes into the picture to wonder about that.  It's one of Gable's footloose roles.  If they wanted to pair the two, even his fast talking reporter persona would better fit than this knockabout character. Just nuts. Can see Garson in the Kerr role in ""The Hucksters"" or something where he's at least housebroken.  Rough and tumble doesn't suit her. Things don't ring true until Joan Blondell shows up.  Now, that makes sense, but it turns out a brief interlude. She's the only normalcy available in this crazy quilt. With Emily and Harry, it's uphill for a while, then back downhill again. He thinks she's the one that's off the beam and doesn't mind saying so. What a roughneck.  Handsome is as handsome does, and he does the crass lummox all too well in this.

531794,4,6303014046,"""Gable's back, and Garson's got him!"" That line is in the trailer, on the posters, and it runs through my mind every time I think of this film. This is Clark Gable's first film after coming home from WWII, and the studio made a big to-do about the king's return.

This movie toggles between his transition from romantic leading man to a more serious, older actor. He's still wonderful when he woos the ladies, but there is something hidden behind the smile, something that would become more pronounced later in his career.

Here Gable is a sailor who comes ashore and begins flirting with beautiful women, as he always does. The saying, ""a girl in every port"" applies to him, and he's got the tattoos to prove it. But when he stumbles into a library with a friend (Thomas Mitchell), he spies an elegant lady (Greer Garson) and her brassy friend (Joan Blondell). His collector's brain makes him follow them, but he comes much more deeply entangled than he ever intended.

The pairing with Garson is a bit strange, but it works. Gable could be a leading man to any woman because he refused to adapt to them. His masculinity shines so brightly, it is no wonder that every woman is attracted to him, which is why Gable is such a legend. And it is his personality which carries the film and makes it so enjoyable. The other cast members are wonderful in their own rights, but he is the reason to watch. Without him, this movie wouldn't stand the test of time.",1328054400,2,1454,4.520912547528517

531797,3,6303014046,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""ADVENTURE"" (1945) (135 min/B&W) -- Starring Clark Gable, Greer Garson, Joan Blondell, Thomas Mitchell, Tom Tully & John Qualen

Directed by Victor Fleming

Harry Patterson (Clark Gable) is the bos'ns mate on a merchant marine vessel, a tough sailor and fighter with a girl in every port. But while in a San Francisco library, looking up a book on the human soul for his sidekick Mudgin (Thomas Mitchell), Harry meets librarian Emily Sears (Greer Garson), whom he woos, marries, and leaves to sail off on another freighter. When he returns, Emily has retreated to an old farm to await the birth of their child. Harry continues to resent staying in one place, but he ultimately changes his tune when his baby's life hangs in the balance.

Greer Garson and Joan Blondell, playing her outspoken best friend, are both terrific, and Gable gives a less heroic performance that's a thoughtful change for him.

This film was Clark Gable's first after he returned to Hollywood following his service in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He had joined in August 1942, following the death of his wife Carole Lombard. MGM hyped this film as Gable's big comeback, using the line, ""Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him!"" in the advertising. Audiences at first lined up to see the King back in action, but the novelty wore off and the film flopped.

The film was a critical and commercial disaster upon release, effectively ending its star Clark Gable's reign as ""The King of Hollywood"" and his viability as a box office champion. He was so disappointed by the finished film that he did not agree to act again until more than a year had passed.

531798,5,6303014046,"I am a BIG Greer Garson fan, and I think this movie was superb! I thought the chemistry between Gable and Garson was wonderful. I really believed every moment of this movie.

  This film marks the only teaming of Greer Garson and Clark Gable.  It was so good that I'm sad they didn't do more movies together.

  This movie is all about a sailor named Harry Patterson (Gable) who finally decides to take leave in San Francisco. There, he meets the beautiful Emily Sears (Garson), a librarian, who seems very content with her life: single and miserable. After awhile, the two realize they love each other, and get married in Reno. But Harry can't fight his love of the sea, and he leaves his wife, not knowing when he will return.

  I cry every time I see this movie. It's so heart-warming and real, despite the fact that it was made during WWII and times have definatly changed.

  Don't forget to look for the part where Harry and Emily steal the chickens! It's funny to watch Greer Garson make chicken sounds!

  This movie has a magnificent cast including Joan Blondell and Thomas Mitchell. A must see!",1104364800,29,1105,4.561224489795919

I love Clark Gable, and Greer Garson is a good actress as well, but they disliked each other and had very poor chemistry in the movie.  Even worse, the script is horrible and combines ponderous philosophizing on the subject of a man's soul with would-be screwball comedy that is more bizarre than funny.  This film was Gable's return to moviemaking after his long absence during World War II (after the shock of Carole Lombard's death, he fulfilled her final wish that he serve in the war by joining the Air Force).  MGM plugged the film heavily, but it was such a bad flop that the studio didn't make another Gable film for over a year.
