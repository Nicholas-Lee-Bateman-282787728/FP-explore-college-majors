No one could play this part better than John Goodman. As a history buff, this is one of the best portrayals of one of the most interesting politicians in American history.",1020556800,5,321,4.333333333333333
661634,4,6303477151,"This film produced for TNT in 1995 would deserve attention if only for John Goodman's bravura performance.  He is fascinating to watch here.  One seldom sees an screen actor (on large or small screen) get to sink his  teeth so completely into a character. Leonard Maltin's review above,  however, suggests that Goodman IS the sole reason to watch this film.  I'd  have to disagree.  The direction by noted TV director Thomas Schlamme is  solid, and the script by Paul Monash is compelling.  The sets, lighting and  cinematography capture that 30s aura perfectly.  And the rest of the cast  is fine, particularly Ann Dowd, Anne Heche, Matt Craven, Hoyt Axton and  Jeff Perry.  Goodman dominates--as well he should--but this is overall a  well-acted, serious and intelligent film.  It's significant, for instance,  that actors like Goodman and Heche are as good here or better as they've  been in any number of cinematic releases.  We occasionally hear from actors  that in this era of big budgets and special effects,the meatier roles are  on the small screen. A film like KINGFISH certainly helps prove the point.",962928000,14,1113,5.0054945054945055

directed by Thomas Schlamme
approximately 1 hour 36 minutes

This is a TV movie about the controversial Louisiana populist Huey Long.  I believe it was originally produced for TNT.  The best part of the movie is John Goodman's performance as the title character.  The director, Thomas Schlamme, is best-known for the comedy 'So I Married an Axe Murderer'.

We see more or less everything Long is known for, from his rowdy stump speeches condemning big oil to his behind the scenes deals to amass political strength.  We watch his ambitions swell as he goes from the Governorship to the U.S. Senate.  With each step, he made more and more enemies.  His actions mobilized an anti-Long coalition of business interests and politicians in his home state.  There was also a lot of tension within the Democratic Party about Long's potential challenge to FDR.  In some ways, Huey Long represents the best and worst aspects of American political savvy, a fact that this movie shows well.

The movie is subtitled ""a story of Huey P Long"", but there are more than a few stories that have been thrown in for dramatic effect.  One of the conflicts in the movie shows the long-married Huey having an affair with a woman named ""Aileen Dumont"".  This woman did not exist in real life, but in the movie she becomes the Louisiana Secretary of State!  Also, the movie portrays Huey's brother Earl as a doofus sidekick.  While Earl Long may not have been the most intelligent man in politics, he was very quick on his feet and was later elected Governor of Louisiana three times!  He was no slouch.

Huey Long was a larger than life individual who led a very interesting life.  He was a huckster to some and a messianic figure to others.  There are plenty of stories about him from his fans and from his critics.  He is not somebody whose story need to be made ""more interesting"" with imaginary characters or speculation.  This is an alright movie with great acting (particularly from Goodman), but if you are interested a somewhat more accurate narrative about the man you should probably see the Life and Assassination of Kingfish with Ed Asner.",1236988800,3,2143,4.753387533875339
7848375,5,6303477151,"Goodman was good in ""The Babe"" but this film was his best.

I remember seeing it on television when it first came out, but its journey to VHS took forever, and we are yet to see the DVD version (why not?)

As he did with Babe Ruth, Goodman immerses himself in the role and you end up thinking you're really looking at Huey Long.

This is a must-see for anyone with a sense of political history.",1168041600,,394,4.157894736842105
