4504402,3,B004Z1HY4U,"Someone else already mentioned Final Destination...  same plot going on here ( essentially )

The movie as a whole fell pretty flat for me...  I didn't particularly care for any of our protagonists...  Much of the acting was on the poorish / silly side.  Special effects were not anything special for the kill shots...  In fact many of the death scenes happen ""off camera"", so we don't even know exactly what happened...

Just as the movie finally started to take an interesting twist ( like last 10-15 mins ), they go ahead and end the movie leaving a lot of the ""explanation"" unexplained...

Hey, for a freebee on Prime, it was ""o...k..."".  Would I watch it again?  Probably not...  but I'll go ahead and go with 3 stars.",1517961600,,723,4.5703125
4504403,3,B004Z1HY4U,I have tried to watch this movie twice but every time I start it a documentary about life starts instead. I don't believe it's part of the movie at all because I fast forward and it was talking about babies lol I wish it could be fixed so that I can watch it.,1516665600,2,259,3.9056603773584904
4504404,1,B004Z1HY4U,Amazon this is not the movie Smile....this is some documentary from the 1970s...please get it together and put the right movie that matches the title...some people may want to watch the actual film Smile...,1516406400,,206,5.088235294117647
4504405,3,B004Z1HY4U,"Smile 2009 is a great movie that didn't deserve a 3.4 on imdb.com,, Smile has Harriet MacMasters-green and armand Assante the perfect mystery horror film which deserves a sequel",1400198400,,177,5.137931034482759
4504406,3,B004Z1HY4U,"""Take lots of pictures of your friends, what is a great moment if you can't prove that you had it?""  A group of friends on vacation lose thier camera.  They meet a nice dealer (Assante) who give them a great deal on an old polariod camera.  After the friends begin to wind up dead they wonder if the camera is the cause.  I will start by saying that this was better then I expected.  That said this is also nothing that hasn't been done before.  Group of kids...evil guy...group gets killed off...yada yada yada.  Much like a ""Final Destination"" type movie where you know who will die next and you just wait for it to happen.  The best part of the movie hands down is the last 2 minutes, an average movie with a sweet ending.  Overall, this plot has been done 1,000 times, but this time a camera is involved.  This version is not that bad though. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - Not this one, but next month I'm sure another version will some out.",1313193600,5,955,4.220994475138122
8449212,1,B004Z1HY4U,terrible acting. i couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes. do not waste your time.,1524960000,,87,4.5

8449214,1,B004Z1HY4U,"Basically a tale of  what not to do lost in a  forest, i.e., panic when confronted with something you can't face, scream loudly  in rage at your friends to expose your location, walk alone into said spooky woods on personal business  unaccompanied  and so forth. All the acting was done poorly by much older people who were supposed to be college age, . AND the stitched face woman image with the title' 'Smile' did not showcase this movie at all.",1521331200,,447,4.5375

8449220,3,B004Z1HY4U,"The acting is a bit mundane, but not overly bad. They spent too much time leading up to the interesting stuff, then the movie was over. A decent way to waste a bit of time.",1518998400,,172,3.942857142857143
