I loved the characters such as Dante, Randal, Jay, and Silent Bob. The  storyline with Dante's love life had twists and turns that I found very  laughable. And Silent Bob's quote was the best.

As you look at the way  Kevin Smith put all of this together it is very obvious that there were  items of interelatedness to it all.  He has created themes and stuck to  them so there is obvious continuity.
The humor was great, and the  premise was strong.  The swearing was a bit much, but it was real.  All in  all this is a great film to see even if it is just so that you can see what  life is like for a bunch of bored kids.",913593600,,623,3.873015873015873

Bottom line, this movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious with a lot of great social commentary.  This, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy are Kevin Smith's best.",1462233600,,405,5.412698412698413

Before Kevin Smith found his true calling as a podcaster, he made a splash on the indie film scene with this shoestring-budget comedy.  The screenplay was clearly written by a young man, painfully earnest and self-satisfied with some pretty mundane insights into the adult world that the protagonists are growing into.  However, its honest, unguarded nature also has a lot of charm, and it features some very good dialog.  It deserves a place on the pantheon of American workplace comedies.",1462060800,,733,5.177966101694915

But if you're not familiar with the documentary that is on here, definitely check it out.  It is outstanding.  To see these young guys take such a huge risk is very encouraging.  You don't have to be an aspiring filmmaker to enjoy it.  It can be for anyone who is thinking about taking a leap of faith for your dreams.  If you are an aspiring filmmaker or struggling filmmaker this will give you the jolt to keep on going for it.

Now, many years later, I have a Blu-ray disc of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the director's and actors' commentary that the DVD has. The DVD commentary gave a little bit of insight about how the movie was made, but I found that listening the VERY drunk actor who played Randall made up for the lack of info about the movie! Despite his hilarious performance, he went back to his day job at the post office; he eventually married the girl who played Caitlin--watch the movie carefully when they have scenes together, and you can tell that she really caught his eye.

This movie was great when it came out over 20 years ago and it's great now! Just comic brilliance and one of the most wonderful indie films of all time. (And it's a true indie film. Not this modern day ""I only had a budge of $7 million and had to release under the FOX Searchlight banner"" nonsense. This movie was made for $30,000 by a guy who had his friends as the production staff (and half the cast)

From Randal pining on what bothered him about Return of the Jedi to Olaf signing Berserker this movie is just fantastic. And it holds up over time!

If you've buying this on disc, and it's WELL worth the money to do so, get the Clerks X anniversary version with all the special features. It's the only way to go.

651781,2,6303430570,"Where do I begin with ""Clerks?"" I saw it when it originally came out on video. My first impression (which still stands) is that the filmmaker, Kevin Smith, managed to make a coherent, compactly told movie, in spite of it being very low budget. What Smith was trying to say came nicely to the forefront. That message was ""This is what kids in their teens and twenties act like in Red Bank, New Jersey."" Sadly, that is everything good I have to say about this movie.

When I first watched it, it also struck me that this movie just barely worked, as it completely banked on the idea of being obscene and dirty. In fact, the whole movie was an excuse just to do that: be obscene and dirty. Once you peeled back that layer, there was really nothing underneath. There was somewhat of a ""love story"" between Dante and his girlfriend, but it was just barely there, and just barely stopped this movie from being a pure obscenity-fest.

Movies like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" brilliantly wove in a story of two best friends who need each other: Ferris to have an audience and sidekick, and Cameron to have someone to help him live his life. It wove together a really fun comedy together with a rather heartfelt drama. There is a really nice drama under the surface of that movie that gives it a depth. Comedies either need to do that, or be a hilarious romp that just makes you laugh with wittiness the whole way through. If you're not especially blown away by vulgarity (like I'm not), you're going to find that this movie doesn't really have much of a foundation. The whole thing is just an excuse to throw some potty-mouth humor out there. That's true whether you love this movie or hate it.

I remember watching ""Clerks"" with other teens in the mid-'90s, and they erupted with disgust and laughter every time something gross was said, but it really wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of George Carlin, Dave Attell, and a few others. When someone can blend together wittiness and vulgarity, it can be awesome, but I am more attracted to the wittiness myself. To me, disgusting and funny are two different things. They can be weaved together, but disgusting by itself is just disgusting and not really funny. That's what ""Clerks"" is.

Anyways-to the people who just love disgusting by itself, I'd say ""play on,"" but it's not my thing. I think anyone would have to admit that some of the premises for the scenes in here are childishly stupid, and plenty of the acting is ridiculously bad. I just remember watching ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" and really wanting my money back. When Mark Hamill entered and got into a light saber duel, I remember thinking ""This was a serious waste of time."" When Kevin Smith runs out of ideas, then there is nothing left, and it is boring and painful to watch. The guy rides the line of being amateur and slips under it pretty often. In any event, I didn't like ""Clerks"" (although ""Chasing Amy"" was near-brilliant, and ""Cop Out"" was one of my favorite comedies since the year 2000). However, I won't quite give ""Clerks"" one star. I see what Smith was doing and the gross out comedy was vaguely funny. I'd probably give this 1.5 stars if that were possible. Since it wasn't abysmally bad, I give it two stars. I have spoken, and there is no arguing with me.",1427846400,3,3302,4.516722408026756

CLERKS: Dante (O'Halloran) isn't even supposed to be there today, but he shows up at the convenience store to fill in for a friend. And he spends the day in Convenience Store Hell, forced to deal with his ambitious, obnoxious girlfriend, his anti-ambitious best-bud Randal (Anderson), who works (yeah, right, ""works"") in the video store next door, and his idealized ex-girlfriend, who dumped him years ago but now wants to make up. Not to mention the nutjob customers, shoplifters and smokers (of all ages), his rooftop roller hockey league, his ex-g'friend's love monkey, his dead friend, and his basic life-in-a-senseless-funk-going-down-the-toilet attitude. Worst of all--he's not even supposed to BE there today!

Discussion: It's a triumph of ""BOB"" (""Brains Over Budget""). When you've got no money to make a movie, you've got only one thing to depend on: talent. Smith has it in abundance. The dialog is archetypal, distilled Gen X: overeducated, undermotivated, overanalyzed, underachieving. It's a movie about slackers with no resources except a brain, a mouth and other sex organs, by a guy who knows them inside out. The film is built on its dialog, and it's outrageous, brilliant and hilarious. But...37?",1421798400,,1473,5.05761316872428

In fact, having watched Clerks 2 having been filmed in color thinks that if it was an artistic choice, it was brilliant(but it wasn't an artistic choice). The bulk of this movie occurs within a Convenience store. It is hilariously written, the acting is adequate but serves the purpose.

Black and White was a budgetary decision on the producers part. There are scenes here and there which have cuts which seemingly make no sense, but make you laugh anyways. As it turns out, the fillers were used due to film processing or production issues cropping up from time to time.

This movie is well worth watching, once , twice, thrice and even more. I love the whole success story of this producer who maxed out credit cards, and borrowed heavily to produce this.",1418169600,,874,4.560509554140127

There is no real action or sight gags - the entire movie is centered around one day in the life (if you can call it that) of two clerks in a convenience store and adjacent video store. The language and discussion topics are continuously raunchy and provides very few funny moments. In fact this movie was originally given an NC-17 rating based almost entirely on the language and subject matter. One item of note, and the only thing that precipitated the second star, is the initial appearance of Jay & Silent Bob - although Jay is also raunchy, the interplay between these two is a brief island of humor in a sea of muck. Of interest - Silent Bob is not always.",1413849600,,800,4.448979591836735

652276,5,6303430570,"This is the review I gave this film on tv.com

The View Askewniverse is one of the best comedy film series around. The first film Clerks, was the vision of Kevin Smith who maxed out credit cards and even sold his comic book collection to see it through.

The film is about Dante Hicks who has to work at Quickstop Groceries on his day off. He interacts with his best friend Randal Grave who works at RST Video and often messes with customers. And of course this film introduces Jay and Silent Bob, one of the greatest comedy duos around.

Over the course of the film, Dante has to deal with a chewing gum representative making an anti-smoking campaign, playing hockey on the roof, going to an ex-girlfriend's funeral, dealing with annoying customers, dealing with his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree getting married to an Asian design major, and his feelings for his current girlfriend, which ends with Caitlin accidentally having sex with a dead man and his girlfriend dumping him.",1408579200,2,977,4.769230769230769

As stated above, it does have moments of amusing and/or insightful bits but these are few and far between. I did laugh during the film, but not nearly as much as it seems it wanted me to. There is evident skill in a variety of areas poking through in this film. Again, we know what this team eventually achieves.

652668,5,6303430570,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie and have for years.  I think Kevin Smith and crew did a great job of capturing the clerks crowd (or people in the service industry) and 20 ""somthings"" in general. I enjoy the interactions between the characters and the crazy, ""from left field"" topics discussed.  For example, Dante and Randall are talking about the difference between the Death Star being blown up in Star Wars versus in Return of the Jedi.  An individual, who happens to be an independent contractor, overhears them, joins the conversation and actually makes a compelling argument... I won't spoil it for you.

This movie is not an action packed rollick it is, however, a slice of life from the '90s.  The focus is on the dialogue and the experiences of the characters throughout their day.  Kevin did appear to use friends and local talent as evidenced in the delivery of some of the lines but I think it added a certain charm to the overall experience.

Bottom line:  This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  If you have seen Clerks 2 do not expect the same thing from this movie.  By the time Kevin Smith made #2 his style and skill as a writer/director had really developed.",1394582400,,1180,4.6298076923076925

652672,5,6303430570,"I adored this low budget, independent film, which is a really good comedy, even if the humour doesn't always fly very high... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), a 22-year-old retail clerk at a local Quick Stop convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey, is called to work on his day off by his boss to cover a few hours for another employee who is sick. Disgusted but not daring to refuse, Dante comes to work and opens shop.

During the rest of the film we will watch him working, facing all kind of weird customers but also converse with his best (only?) friend, Randal Graves, who in principle works at the neighboring video store, RST Video, but spends almost the entire day at the Quick Stop. His present and past girlfriends will also come visiting at one moment...

As it was already said, this is an independent film, which cost barely 27 500 USD to make (yes, it is twenty seven thousand five hundred). It was also the first film the director, Kevin Smith (barely 24 at this time), ever made... Because Smith was broke at that point, he cut the costs to the minimum by turning it in black and white and by casting his friends and family members in most secondary roles - he also took numerous low limit credit cards and maxed them out... The film became a minor hit and made more than 3 millions USD in the cinemas - and much, much more since with DVD sales.

The charm of this film resides entirely in the dialogs and in strange and sometimes weird (even creepy) situations. The conversations between Dante and Randall cover a large variety of topics, including but not limited to ""Star Wars"" and life in general... The conversations they have with various customers are even better...))) Two small time marijuana dealers, Jay and Silent Bob, who make their sales in front of the two shops, intervene in a couple of occasions - they don't say much, but their contributions are important.

The language is very strong and the humour occasionally doesn't fly very high but still, this film has considerable charm and some gags are simply irresistible. Cynical and lucid Randal is a character somehow more appealing that Dante, on whom the whole story focuses, but ultimately I grew fond of both of them. I didn't see the 92 minutes pass and at the end I was really sorry that it was over...

Let's get some things straight:
Considering that Kevin Smith funded Clerks all on his own (using his credit cards) and filming at the Convenience Store he worked at, makes Kevin Smith and the movie ""Clerks"" ingenious in its own right.
The dialogue (although raunchy, and hilarious I might add) is truthful and honest.  Come on, anyone in the retail industry would love to spit water in a customer's face, or ""lash out"" at the common customer. ""Cute cat, what's its name?"" ""Annoying customer.""  Priceless stuff.
Fast forward to Mallrats (which, don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed).
Mallrats was funded by Miramax and provided (I believe) a $3M budget and it bombed at the box office.  It wasn't until release on video that this movie began making money.
So what does this tell us?  That Kevin Smith kept it simplistic with clever writing, used friends as actors and made a fortune with ""Clerks"". And I respect him enormously for what he accomplished with this film.
Sure, not everyone will get it, but that's what makes this film a class in itself.

653098,5,6303430570,"Clerks was/is his first film of director Kevin Smith. Coming from a fan of Smith's, I have to admit, this film is just hilarious, no matter what generation you're from (whether it be X, Y, or Z). The film follows the daily life of two best friends, Randall Graves (played by Jeff Anderson), who runs the non-fictional video store, R.S.T. Video, which is right next door to his friend Dante Hicks' (Brian Christoper O'Halloran) workplace, the Quick Stop Groceries convenience store. Outside both their stores, ""live"" 2 drug peddlers, Jay (played by Jay Mewes, Kevin Smith's best friend) & Silent Bob (played by the film's director, Kevin Smith).

About the DVD: This 10th Anniversary DVD is just awesome, loaded with hrs. of extras, including the very 1st cut of the film, before it hit theaters in 1994.

Although this film is in B&W, it is still funny, regardless of whether or not it's in living colour (sorry, NBC and FOX, I just had to say that.) If you love Kevin Smith, buy and watch Clerks.",1353369600,,997,4.691428571428571

653103,5,6303430570,"You ever deeply contemplate what it would be like to work at a Quick Stop or a video store? Well reflect on this deep rooted concept no more: here is Clerks. It is really hard to explain how awesome this film is. Clerks was the first feature film directed by Kevin Smith. It was the voice of a generation and the beginning of an era: slacker cinema.  The plot couldn't be more simple and the dialogue couldn't be more genius.  The story follows the average day of a guy who gets called in to work on his day off.  He has to go in and he hates it. That pretty much sums up the entire movie.  Kevin Smith's uncanny ability to make this unfortunate turn of events seem interesting and funny is nothing short of amazing. There is a zen like quality to the conversations that take place in this film.  There are probably over a 1000 lines in Clerks that will be quoted for a very long time. Which quote is the best and what does it even mean? That is totally up to each individual person that takes the time to watch this movie. If you love this film (and you should) that means one thing: you are alive and you have a very healthy sense of humor. It is important to note that this film was shot for $27,575 in the convenience store where director Kevin Smith worked in real life. It went on to gross over $3 million in theaters and launched Smith's career.  it goes to show that good writing and a little bit of realism can go a long way.

Its a movie about life and when one has a few moments to step back and really look at what we are doing, saying, where we are going, and how we are getting there you can really see the utter humor of it all. ""I'm not even supposed to be here today"" is/was the moniker of us all at one point or another in our lives and this movie is about those funny, odd, trying to act grownup moments we have all had.

653185,4,6303430570,"Long before Kevin Smith became the self-important Hollywood type that he is today, he was an average schmoe like the rest of us. He worked dead end jobs post high school until his calling came. Through sacrifice, hard work, and a crap-load of credit card debt, he wrote, directed, and financed the penultimate guerilla film ""Clerks"".

This film, some exaggeration not withstanding, is LIFE. The tedium, the bouts of immature and petty jealousy, the absurd conversations among friends at work...it's all here in spades. We all have gone through times in our lives where we question everything..Is she the right one?....Is this what I'll be doing the rest of my life?...What smells like shoe polish?....

The dialogue, as has been stated by numerous critics, is brutally frank...but HONEST. Often funny and to the point, Smith's script flows lucidly and, for a group of untried actors, lines are delivered with surgical precision. Watch the first lengthy conversation between Randall and Dante and see how there isn't a single cut in the midst of it. That's an awful lot of dialogue to get in one steady shot. It really is impressive and speaks volumes for O'Halloran and Anderson.

The somewhat grainy black and white look adds to the vibe. I couldn't imagine this film in color. It's basically little more than a student film (production-wise), but it really does surpass one's expectations. It's a film of it's time...and easily one of the BEST films of it's time. Fortunately, it still remains relevant on many levels. How many cookie-cutter movies does Hollywood make these days that leave absolutely no mark on the art form?

This movie didn't leave a mark....it left a vulgar little spray painted tattoo on it...and that's okay by me.",1325203200,3,1739,4.9862068965517246

This edition, from what I know, is just a bulky before Blu-Ray DVD package. I've heard that on the 15th anniversary edition (Blu-Ray) there is more, but it's also the same features as this one.

Now about how I received it; when I opened it, it was perfect. Not opened, or anything. Then on closer look, it looks like someone dropped it down 50 stairs. The disks are fine, but the package was dent and cracked. Disappointed at the way it was shipped.

So it's worth it only if you don't have Blu-Ray, or if you, Like me, Collect limited editions and Blu-Ray Editions.
I give it three stars (This product should have a four star rating, but I was displeased with shipping.)",1310342400,,1365,4.679166666666666

I don't need to gush about Kevin Smith or talk about how much I love Clerks or any of his other work. His work speaks for itself.
Having never purchased Clerks X, which I've wanted to do for so very long (for the funeral scene alone) I was happy to pick this up and see that added scene and much, much more. There are more special features than you can shake a stick at, including the F-bomb counter (way more than 37) or tidbits of facts that pop up as you re-watch this classic tale of jockeying a register.

653219,5,6303430570,"It's been awhile, so I don't know who recommended this movie to me, but whoever you are (and I hope you're reading this) - thank you!

I really thought I was going to be too old to really appreciate Clerks and I didn't expect much more than another mindless teen comedy, but wow was I wrong and what a treat this movie was! This was one of the most intelligent and funniest comedies I've ever seen. No relying on sight gags for a laugh, no outrageous set pieces leading up to a (usually poorly written) joke, no gross out American Pie type of humor, no relying on swearing for a laugh, no mocking humor. Clerks is pure genius and every scene is an absolute gem. I could go on and on about this movie, but I won't do that other than to say that while I still think Al Pacino's Scarface is still the best quotable movie ever, Clerks is a really, really close second.

It's just so refreshing after watching some of the dumbed down movies that get passed off as comedy nowadays to see something as awesome as this movie. On the scale of smart comedies, I rank this right up there with something like Jack Benny's To Be or Not to Be.

After I watch the movie again I'll know for certain, but right now I think Randall might be one of my most favorite movie characters of all time.

I'd recommend Clerks to anyone to watch over and over again.

Fortunately, all his films have been given grand treatment on blu-ray (Jersey Girl, a non askewaverse film has not yet showed up on the format) his first film is over-due.

First of all, Clerks is a first-rate silly-movie full of some of the best dialogue ever put on the screen - Smith is like a non-violent Tarintino. It's not for everyone, firstly it's a bit dated and second it's not the go for endless laughs sort of film like Superbad or 40 Year Old Vergin that people are now used to.

So why put a film shot on cheap cameras, edited in a video store on a table during working hours and shot on Smith's credit-card budget? Because, you're HDTV has 1080 lines of resolution and your DVD has 480. Can Clerks ever look chrystal clear and razor sharp, nope, but can it look just like the best possible print projected on a large screen? Yes! Watching Clerks on DVD on an HDTV is going to introduce jaggeed lines and added distortion to an already grainy film, watching it on blu-ray, you see exactly what is on the original film, just like it looks on the film.

Brilliant independent cult comedy which marked the debut of writer-director-actor Kevin Smith is one of the 90's best and original comedies. Here this movie gives us original characters that no one will forget including the live-action equalant to Beavis and Butt-Head known as Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) and Jay (Jason Mews) who are badass stoner characters. I love how the clerks in this movie are speaking to each other about movies including on which Star Wars is better and how they goof around when they are suppose to work.

After watching that crazy/sincere and original movie, I wanted to see what else director Kevin Smith had made. ""Clerks,"" his first film, made on the cheap, is roughly shot in black on white. It is over-written and horribly acted. But there is something fascinating and real about the film. ""Clerks"" is set almost exclusively inside a North Jersey mini-market and next door video store. Writer Kevin Smith seems to have thrown every gross conversation idea he had into the film. It vibrates with the familiar (and pathetic) issues of the post-high-school-pre-marriage school crowd, living away from home and letting loose on each other to try to arrange their private lives. Main character Dante Hicks is a 24-year-old store clerk. He and and current floozy girlfriend Caitlin are on fairly good terms until the conversation turns to the number of other lovers each has had. Meanwhile, Dante pines for old flame Veronica, whose engagement notice just appeared in the paper. Slacker friend Randal clerks the (mostly customer-free) video store next door until he gets bored and pops into the markeet to annoy Dante and insult his customers. There are rooftop street hockey games, a fiaso in a funeral parlor, a list of porn titles raw enough to curdle sewage, a renewed romance and a dead guy in a bathroom. Just another day at the mini-mart.

""Clerks"" is foul-mouthed, disgusting, yet over-the-top fascinating. The cast of slackers, losers, half-wits and yokels has potential, not always actualized. Smith's classic duo -- the ever-enigmatic Silent Bob and a particularly potty-mouthed Jay -- make their debut. With ""Clerks,"" Smith shows that he has an eye for character and the absurdity of normal life. A plot twist involving a dead girl and a casket is well done, thouh all the action takes place off screen.

""Clerks"" is not a family film or even a date film by any stretch of the imagination. My wife was not impressed, not say the least. And one piece of writing will leave a really bad taste in your mouth. But the film is a fine document of one filmmaker's starting point in the business. A special stop for any Kevin Smith fan.",1232150400,,2158,4.874659400544959

[first lines]
Dante Hicks: [phone rings and Dante falls out of a closet] Hello. What? No I don't work today, I'm playing hockey at two.
=====================

'Clerks' is the debut film of Kevin Smith, inspired by Richard Linklater's 'Slackers;' and it is the first movie in the 'View Askew' universe, a series of Kevin Smith films with interlocking characters and references. 'Clerks' is a student film financed with credit cards and loans from friends. An interesting bit of trivia is that the entire production cost only $26,000 and securing the rights to the music cost $27,000, more than the cost of making the film. With over 50% of the budget in the music, you'd think they'd have some really great songs, but you'd be wrong. Just run-of-the-mill punk and metal.

--------------
Coroner: What kind of convenience store do you run here?
=====================

Based loosely on ""The Divine Comedy"" by Dante Alighieri, there are nine breaks in the movie to signify the nine rings of hell. Did I mention loosely? James Joyce's 'Ulysses' and the Coen Brothers' 'O, Brother, Where Art Thou?' were both based on Homer, and they were based loosely, I'd say--but to really say 'Clerks' is based on Dante's 'Inferno' is a bit of a stretch.

--------------
Blue Collar Man: Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but, uh, what are you talking about?
Randal Graves: The ending of ""Return of the Jedi"".
Dante Hicks: My friend here's trying to convince me that any independent contractors who were working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the Rebels.
=====================

The clerks in 'Clerks' are Dante and Randal. Dante is the slightly more responsible of the pair. Though he resents being forced to clerk at Quick Mart on his day off instead of playing hockey, as he was looking forward to, he soldiers on--albeit closing the store briefly to play an ad hoc game of hockey on the roof and to attend a funeral. Customers constantly interrupt his reveries.

--------------
Cold Coffee Lover: What do you mean there's no ice? You mean I gotta drink this coffee hot?
=====================

Randal, who works at a nearby video store, is slightly less responsible. He embodies 'customer disservice' throughout. He leaves his video store because he wants to rent a video, a good video at a good video store--NOT the one he works at. The rest of the time he spends shooting the breeze with Dante at Quick Mart, or abusing his customers.

--------------
Indecisive Video Customer: These are the same two movies! You weren't paying any attention!
Randal Graves: No, I wasn't.
Indecisive Video Customer: I don't think your manager would appreciate it if-
Randal Graves: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Indecisive Video Customer: I beg your pardon?
Randal Graves: Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Indecisive Video Customer: I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Randal Graves: And I hope it feels good.
Indecisive Video Customer: You hope *what* feels good?
Randal Graves: I hope it feels so good to be right. There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Indecisive Video Customer: Well, this is the last time I rent here.
Randal Graves: You'll be missed.
=====================

Kevin Smith actually worked at the Quick Mart where 'Clerks' was filmed, and he was only allowed to film at night. Thus, the shutters had to be drawn and the premise for this was that pranksters had put gum in the locks of the shutters. He makes a sign with shoe polish so people will know the store is open which leads to a running gag about how he smells like shoe polish. It wasn't funny the first time, and gets less so with each repetition. But that is how he rolls, improvising around obstacles and limitations.

--------------
Dante Hicks: This is different, this is important. How many?
[long pause as customer buys something]
Dante Hicks: Well?
Veronica Loughran: Something like... 36.
Dante Hicks: What? Something like 36?
Veronica Loughran: Lower your voice.
Dante Hicks: Wait, what is that anyway, something like 36? Does that INCLUDE me?
Veronica Loughran: Ummm... 37.
Dante Hicks: I'm 37?
=====================

'Clerks' introduces the characters of Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang around in front of the Quick Mart. Silent Bob is played by director Kevin Smith himself, and he says little, to allow motor mouth Jay more airtime. When he does speak on occasion, you listen. curious as to what he will finally say.

--------------
Silent Bob: [His only line] You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.
=====================

Dante's dilemma, apart from him being dissatisfied with his station in life and being forced to clerk on his day off, is that he has a girlfriend but can't get his ex-girlfriend out of his mind. He has been communicating with her, and they may get back together again, but he is conflicted.

--------------
Caitlin Bree: I'm offering you my body and you're offering me semantics.
=====================

'Clerks' is an interesting student film with loads of flaws--yet it has a certain charm and promises better things to come. The acting is terrible. No one is experienced, and it shows. But the real tragedy is that I wasn't even supposed to be here today.

----------------
Dante Hicks: You know what the real tragedy about all this is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!

This is one of the comedies that echo truth that exists in you that you can only understand if you have actually worked as a convenience store clerk.  The lead character Dante Hicks has to deal with irate customers, a girlfriend that has issues with his stature in life, an nymphomatic ex-girlfriend, and a best friend that almost wants to see him fail.

This is one of the ultimate slacker comedies.  I was first aware of because of an article in Details magazine hailing it as one the latest and greatest independent films released.  I went out to Suncoast Video (do those even exist anymore?) and purchased the VHS tape for 29.99 and went home and immediately popped it in the video tape.

This is one the best movie for one liners that you repeat to your friends.  This is one of the movies where either you get it or you don't.  It's one of the greatest slacker comedies made.  If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing and go out and get it.

653468,5,6303430570,"Kevin Smith's first movie in ""The Jersey Trilogy"" is arguably still his all-time best! Shot in Black & White on a low budget, it features content over flash.  It chronicles a day in the life of Dante Hicks, a convenience store clerk who gets called in to work on his day off.  His friend Randall Graves works at the low-rate video store across the way.  Randall is a bitter, cynical young guy who doesn't like or respect anyone or anything (except maybe hermaphorditic porn).  Through all his trials in this day, Dante keeps whining his tag phrase, ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!""  This movie was everyone's first introduction to the characters, Jay and Silent Bob.  Writer/director Kevin Smith is excellent in the role of Silent Bob.  J & SB are great as minor, background silly, obscene characters to lighten the plot (which is brilliant...but even this heavily real comedy benefits from the comic relief).  But in other movies where Kevin has tried to feature J & SB as main characters (such as ""Mallrats"", ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back""), the plots get silly, juvenile and aimed at teenagers.  This is a more mature and real comedy aimed at adults.  Please, Kevin.......for the sake of the part of your audience that has a brain, keep Jay and Silent Bob as minor side characters in all upcoming flicks.  This is a stark, vulgar, real comedy that looks at life from the vantage point of someone who has grown up a little.  It's funny, because it's real.  Kevin's co-producer Scott Mosier also takes 2 small roles in the film.  Mosier plays a stoner who is knicknamed Snowball because of a sex practice he likes.  Scott also plays an irate customer who gets mad that Dante closed the store to play hockey on the roof.  This irate customer bullies his way into the game.  And when Dante gets fined for selling cigarettes to small children (even though he's innocent?) and a college girl accidentally has sex with a dead guy in the bathroom, the authorities are left to wonder, ""What kind of a store are you running here, anyway?""  There is nothing dirty or nasty that happens on-screen.  But due to adult language and frank discussions of adult subjects, this film is not for general audiences.  With the possible exception of ""Chasing Amy"", this is by far Kevin Smith's best film (and that includes all 5 or 6 flicks that comprise ""The Jersey Trilogy""), because it is vulgar and raw and very real.

I say ""might have been."" As it happens, ""Clerks"" turned out to be an impressively funny film that warrants a place in our memories for artistic reasons, not backstage controversies. Now that time has passed, everyone knows ""Clerks,"" but most have forgotten the rating debate that almost overshadowed it.

""Clerks"" was made cheap, and it shows. The film stock is inexpensive, and most of the actors aren't actors. Some of them play multiple roles with little attempt to change their appearance. The performances are amateurish, though the two leads are passable. One is amazed that such unprofessionalism could make it to the silver screen, until one hears Kevin Smith's wonderful dialogue. His characters are among the funniest, most intelligent speakers in the film world, mixing terms like ""managerial control"" and ""insubordinate"" with every profanity you can name.

The film covers a day in the life of Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), an uninspired convenience store clerk who is called in on his day off and must work the entire day, from open to close. (""I'm not even supposed to be here today!"" becomes his mantra after each mishap.) Dante has little regard for the general public, but he maintains a semi-polite (if not altogether professional) demeanor. At one point, he lies on the floor behind the counter to talk to his girlfriend, but leaves a sign up instructing customers to pay for the purchases on the honor system (which they do, because they think they're being watched).

This is in contrast to his best friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who works at the tiny video store across the street. Randal has the best lines in the movie, thanks to his wise misanthropy and blatant cynicism toward every stranger he encounters. ""I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class,"" he says. ""Especially since I rule.""

The driving plot point is Dante's discovery that his ex-girlfriend Caitlin (Lisa Spoonhauer) is getting married, while his current flame Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) is pressuring him to quit the convenience store and go to college. There are other problems, too, like a funeral everyone's supposed to go to, and a street hockey game that Dante's supposed to play in. Randal has no problem closing the video store for a couple hours, but Dante has that nagging work ethic to deal with.

Kevin Smith grew as a writer and a director as time went on. ""Clerks,"" while featuring fine dialogue, has some problems. Two major events are both said to have happened at 4 p.m., for example, and Veronica has college classes despite it being a Saturday. The film, while only 90 minutes or so, runs the risk of getting old before it's finished; no matter how pithy the dialogue may be, a movie with nothing but talking is still just a movie with nothing but talking.

But you overlook that because of what's here. There are wonderful jabs at retail jobs, with Randal and Dante each describing the typical morons they have to deal with (like the guy who comes into the video store and says, ""Do you have that one with that guy who is in that movie last year?,"" or the woman who looks through every gallon of milk in search of the one with an expiration date in the next century). As such, ""Clerks"" has become a particular favorite among young, semi-ambitious kids stuck in dead-end jobs like these.

When a customer asks what the store's pet cat is called, and Randal says she's named ""Annoying Customer,"" I don't think I'm overstating it to suggest he's saying what everyone in America would LIKE to say.",1195257600,,3747,4.807453416149069

Clerks was Kevin Smiths first movie, but it takes place second in the timeline of the ""New Jersey Cronicles"" just a few days after the events of Mallrats.

Clerks was filmed in black and white with a $27000 budget, but don't let that steer you away. the low budget adds some sense of charm to the movie i haven't found in many others. the black and white adds a sense of artsiness to the cheap film style. its mostly a series of long conversations between the main character working at the quick stop randall next door at the video store. the conversations run everywhere from the contractors who built the Death Star to what they're going to do with the rest of their lives to a lot funny sex talk that has probably offended lots of people since its release.

Expoloding on the scene the same year as Pulp Fiction many people may not realize just how much Clerks has added to pop culture.  One of the best independent films to date.

And the DVD is wonderful.  There's the very interesting commentary, the beavy of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and even a music video which, ironically, is done in color.

This is a film to love, laugh, and just outright have a good time.  It indeed gets my recommendation.

  What i think is as intresting as the dialouge, is the making of the movie. It was basically made by a couple of clerks filming in the store after closing hours. It gives Inspiration to wannabe filmmakers like me.

We rated it as one of the best comedies we'd ever seen.

I now have the DVD. Yes, it's still funny and stands head and shoulders above a lot of the garbage that tries to pass itself off as comedy these days, but is it still 'that' funny? Sadly, I don't think it is. A lot of the fun I gleaned from it on first viewing was in the recognition of situations/dialogues my friend and I had found ourselves in - e.g. an argument with a customer over using our staff-only toilet! Okay, so it isn't the funniest film ever made, so how good is it? Well, nothing really happens by way of plot; there's no 'character development', but then that's no problem; there are some wickedly funny lines/scenarios... but the dialogue is so goddamn awful at times it's beyond belief. No one talks like this. Sometimes it's just so incredibly stilted and over-blown. Okay, it's not a documentary on real life, so it artifcially crafted for specific effects, but even so, some of the lines are so long and awkward, it really does grate, and makes you wonder why they weren't edited long before the camera rolled.

653680,4,6303430570,"If you like Kevin Smith, you like Clerks. I realize that every rule has millions of exceptions, but Smiths low budget indie feature from 1994 reveals everything great (and not so great) about this director/writer/actor (if you call Silent Bob acting).

Clerks came out during an early 90's time-period when culture was taking a step sideways instead of forward. A generation brought up with 80's hair metal, Eddie Murphy movies and The Cosby Show wanted something different. Instead of moving forward, our culture wanted smarter versions of the established entertainment, music fans embraced Nirvana and Pearl Jam, television watchers tuned into Seinfeld and film embraced new visions from the likes of Quentin Tarantino. Enter Kevin Smith into this time with his no budget masterpiece that probably wouldn't have been seen if it were made five years later.

What made Clerks stand out was its revelation that a great script is all you need to make a great movie.  You didn't enjoy Clerks because of its A- list actors, big budget action sequences or filmmaking tricks that director's greatly over hype; you liked Clerks because it was funny and relatable.  Smith's writing captured the everyday feel of his early 20's life as his main characters Dante and Randal's shift at the Quick Stop and RST Video becomes an unexpectedly crazy journey. Dante's struggle with his inability to resolve the issues in his life is what lies at the heart of every great Kevin Smith film. Right up to Clerks II he is a master at writing a realistic interpretation of male insecurity. Dante and Randal both remain believable male characters even while revealing feelings that many males may never actually talk about.  Randal becomes the voice of the audience watching the shenanigans of Dante's life unfold trying to make Dante realize his life is ultimately up to him, while cracking the comments and flipping the bird to his work commitments that both the audience and Dante envy.

The 10th Anniversary DVD holds up surprisingly well as the makers realized that most followers of Smith's had seen this film dozens of time (if not more). Instead of simply providing a nicer looking version of the original, the package contains two must haves for collectors. The first is the original version of Clerks that appeared at New York's Independent Feature Film Market, which started the ball rolling on Clerk's eventually being picked up by Miramax. The original version reveals the dark tone that Smith was originally going for an ending that reveals Dante's struggles to be very small in life's grand scheme (if you see it you'll understand).  The other added element is The Snowball Effect, a documentary about the making of Clerks that takes you from Smith's humble beginnings in New Jersey to his the joy of his $27,000 flick being picked up. The documentary is as addictive as the original Clerks as the sheer audacity and long shot reality of Smith's venture, a young man mortgaging his future on a small flick, is an amazing feat to revisit.

With the release of Clerks II there might be more of an audience for Smith's original. If you wish to indulge in this deluxe package it is worth it, unless of course you are one of the million of exceptions to the originally stated rule.",1155081600,8,3267,4.905797101449275
653681,4,6303430570,"- REVIEW

One way or another, we as people can relate to the Jersey folks in ""Clerks.""  For me, I may not have lived in NJ, or work in a crappy job, or have a girlfriend who gave oral-sex to 37 guys (38 if I was included), but I can understand one key perspective from one of the main characters: life is full of disappointments.  ""Clerks"" is not a disappointment, but it is a reminding tale of how disappointments lead to resentment, or at least lead to whining.

I find it impossible to give a lengthy opinion to a film like this without hinting any repetition.  What else about this film that hasn't been said already?  Some acknowledge the effort that Kevin Smith has put for this project, through the sacrifice of selling everything he has, and the result leads to this certifiable piece of indie.

I do have one constructive criticism about ""Clerks"", and I'm sure that's been irked many times, but still that's the one thing which hold the film back from what I think would be truly awesome: the acting.  I don't mean the obvious-amateur audacity of the flaw, it's the script.  The script is smart and cleverly-written, but when people are actually reading the lines, the dialogue is a bit farfetched.  Some characters are alright with their acts, but others act like they're just reading the script and only hastened their performance just to hide that fact.  Randall is sadly one of the others, and though his role is natural, his cohesive monologues are anything but.  Seriously, no one ever talks that like.  Then again, I'm criticizing at people who have no cinematic experience whatsoever.

Other than that, ""Clerks"" is a likable film with likable characters, if you can handle the harsh obscenity, which it has...a lot.  I certainly like Randall, despite my issue with him, mostly because of his outrageous personality.  He can say whatever he want and do whatever he likes, and he doesn't give a damn about anyone, except for Dante; he's free-spirited in a crass manner and very unapologetic.  He's an a-hole that fans are rooting for.  Dante's not so bad as the other half, his ""I'm not suppose to be here"" mentality makes him a relatable character.  This film is just a taste of the ""snootch-to-the-nooch-ness"" of things to come, which created the insane iconic duo that is Jay and Silent Bob: say what you will about them, these two won't stop.

""Clerks"" dealt not only with Star Wars references that made geeks have nerdgasms, but it dealt with the most thought-provoking subjects ever discussed, like 'not sucking your own ****'.  No wonder the movie was a cult hit in the mid 90s; of course, I was only in elementary school back then, so I didn't know much of it.  But watching the movie proves that to this day, it's still fresh, absurdly funny, and insightful to handle the new generation.

This is Del Keyes, saying ""They might not like us, but we like them.""",1154736000,,2882,4.674603174603175
653682,4,6303430570,"Like many others, I believe, I got hold of the original 1994 ""Clerks"" because of the recently release sequel. What I found in this first installment is a good, authentic, sometimes quirky, sometimes hilarious comedy which I think we should take a bit more seriously that it takes itself.

Despite being shot pretty much in its entirety in the same two basic settings - a convenience store and a video rental store - ""Clerks"" manages not to get stale as it progresses because Kevin Smith is inventive in the way he shoots. The fact that this movie was done in a real life setting, where Kevin Smith actually worked at the time, lends it a lot of authenticity. The dialogue contributes for that and even the grainy amateurish black and white picture helps it.

According to Smith - who has this brilliant little role as an actor himself - this was meant to be the proverbial ""movie about nothing"", with a lot of F-word jokes. In theory, and then in practice, this kind of sounds like an R rated version of Seinfeld. Instead of Seinfeld's place and the coffee shop you have both stores, the relationship problems are also ever present even if in a much more earthly fashion. The real difference is that you get a lot of cursing. Other than that, it's just a day in the life of these two guys running two rusty little stores in Central Jersey.

Dante is the main character and his day shouldn't have gone down this way in the first place. He's just covering for a colleague at the store and all hell breaks loose throughout the day. Who really steals the movie for me is Randal, his partner at the video rental store right next door, with his acid view of life. The way he messes up with the head of all his costumers - including Dante's - is brilliant and funny. Nevermind if he should act like he does.

The dialogue ranges from fascinating to downright boring sometimes and it's definitely Tarantinoesque when at its best. It does suffer a bit on the acting department, which could have benefited from being a little more natural - seems rushed some of the time - but overall it's a great insight into the minds and state of affairs of Generation X America of mid 90s.

Which leads me to ask, where are we now? Maybe ""Clerks II"" will answer that, but I haven't seen it yet as I write this.",1154563200,,2288,4.451073985680191
653683,5,6303430570,"I watched this one after I'd seen all of Kevin Smith's other films,so I caught the humor pretty quickly. I loved the fact that these two had such a blatant disregard for their customers and got to act however they wanted. It also occured to me that the whole film was in black and white. I loved it anyway. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson were quite experienced for their first time out. Escapade after escapade ensues as these two store clerks get wrapped up in just about every misfortune you can think of. Clerks rocks!",1154476800,,525,4.536842105263158
653684,4,6303430570,"Clerks is American filmmaker Kevin Smith's directual debut. The film cost about 25,000 to make, and went on to gross 3 million at the box office -not bad at all for a first movie. Today, the movie is viewed as a cult classic, quoted by many, and revered as Kevin Smith's best film to date -even after movies with bigger budgets.

Dante Hicks, played by Brian O'Halloran, is called in to work at a New Jersey convenient store on a Saturday. He gets there to find that the shutters won't open, the customers that will walk in on that particular day all have major issues, two stoners Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith respectively, that hang around right outside his door all day, and his next door video store clerk buddy Randal, played by Jeff Anderson, is less excited about being at work than he is. In additon to that, he had arranged plans that day to play hockey - which he ends up doing on the roof of the store, and finds out a dirty secret from his woman that explodes into a fight and a possible affair with an old flame.

The film's plot might seem pointless, but Kevin Smith's hilarious dialogue makes Clerks an enjoyable film, plus the movie is shot in black and wite that gives it a sense of coolness. The movie also introduced the world to the quirky characters Jay and Silent Bob, who would end up appearing in all of Smith's future films.

Most importantly, Clerks has become an inspiration for many young American directors to make their mark with the smallest and most affordable budget possible.

653685,4,6303430570,"This is a question that I sometimes ask myself when I'm whatching a Kevin Smith film. Kevin Smith as a writer and filmmaker is kind of hard to describe, but here goes; I think the dialog in his films are intelligent, not quite brilliant. I think his films are far from bad, but far from great. I think he's a lot like Spike Lee in that regard, but even Lee has been able to muster up two great films(""Do The Right Thing"",""Malcom X"") in a long line of hit and misses. In my opinion, Smith has yet to make one ""great"" film(and yes that includes ""Chasing Amy"").

  I thought this movie was a great START for Kevin. The movie is about, obviously, a day in the life, a day at the job, of two friends who work as clerks named Dante and Randle. Dante is an insecure, nice guy, who works in the convenience store, isn't really doing much with his life, and can't really get over a girl named Catlin, who broke up with him when he was still a senior in High School, despite the fact that she cheated on him basically every chance she could. Randle on the other hand, is a rude, lazy, always showing up late for work, unapoligetic smart a** who works in the video store right next to Dante. This is also the debut of two of my favarite movie characters, Jay and Silent Bob. Of  course Jason Mewes( Whose  playing himself basically) provides that silly, immature, homaphobic humer that we all love and relate to. silent Bob played his typical silent comedic role with that oh so important and impactful thing to say during that one point in every movie that Smith has written him in. I'm not going to explain any more of the plot because I don't want to accidentally spoil it for any one who hasn't seen it.

  I'll admit it, I found myself relating a lot to the Dante Hicks's  character in this movie in terms of his temperment and personality. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie and like I said great start for Kevin Smith. As far as extras on the DvD, it's the usuall, deleted scenes, Trailers, blah, but they have an alternate ending, that when I first saw it, part of me thought that it probley would have ruin the film, thus a great decision to cut it out, and another part of me who thinks that had they not cut out the full original ending, it may have gone down as one of the more bizzare, different, and , dare I say, brillient endings, that a movie of that type of Genre has ever had.",1153785600,3,2397,4.262114537444934

Throw around that, Dante's ex and present girlfriends and Jay and Silent Bob hanging out in front and you have a movie about ""nothing.""

For what it cost to make (about $27,000) this movie has a lot more funny and witty scene than most of the high-priced, overblown comedies that Hollywood seems to churn out.  The hockey game on the roof of the store is priceless.  The actor who plays Dante appears to be so talented, that you wonder why he hasn't been in a lot more films after this one.

653729,5,6303430570,"Clerks in many ways is one of those kind of films where the memory of it may be more funnier or effecting than the film itself. Don't get me wrong, the film is funny but I remember it at one point being hysterical. Whether or not it's as good as people say it is, that's beside the point. Point is it's an entertaining movie that people should see regardless of how well(or badly) it's aged.

Dante, the embarassingly pathetic clerk at a local Quick Stop, is called into work on his day off with his boss promising he'll be there by lunch. So Dante goes in and basically has a really terrible day. 2 losers, Jay and Silent Bob, deal outside of the store. He overreacts about his girlfriend's past...""escapades"", his best friend often comes over to bug him and he finds out the former girlfriend/love of his life is getting married. And more happens than that in one day in the life of a convenience store clerk.

Now first off, I'm going to have to tell the film's flaws. One: the acting. Now it's not terrible but it's merely serviceable. Many characters just seem to be reciting their lines, as if the saying of the dialogue was more important than the delivery itself. And the dialogue at times has that ""too smart for its own good"" feel to it. And like I said before, some parts are not as funny anymore. Although some are outright hilarious (""37?!""), other jokes kinda fall flat in a way but it still manages to be entertaining without eye-rolling.

This package quite frankly is packed. Disc 1 has the version we all know as well as commentary. Disc 2 has the original version as well as an optional video commentary. Disc 3 is where everything is: reviews, documentaries, specials and more. For some it's rather overkill, and it kind of is, the superior Chasing Amy Criterion Edition had less features than this. It's great to see everything on a release for a change without resorting to double-dips though. (I'm looking at you Black Hawk Down which has count-em 4(!) separate releases on DVD.

Here he has to deal with the oddies and unreasonable demands of customers, his wiseass sidekick Randal from the video store, and Jay and Silent Bob's loitering.  He tries and tries to be the voice of reason, but keeps being shot down by one after another after another obsticle.

The raunchy humor (Jay and Silent Bob's banter, Randal's listing of porn tapes, and the dead customer in the bathroom, just to name a few) is what makes it edgy.  But the point of this film is perhaps Dante's repeated saying ""I'm not supposed to be here today"".  Is that what it's all about?  Maybe it's about thumbing your nose at the stupid people, and having jobs where I am exposed to the general public all day, everyday, I can relate.  It's a working man's anthem.",1145404800,7,1498,4.569288389513108
653733,2,6303430570,"No doubt I'm going to  get smacked up and down for saying this but, ""What is all the HYPE about?!?!"" I agree with one user who said ""This is quite possibly the most over-rated film of all time."" Sure, this is an indie flick that was basically Kevin Smith's audition for Hollywood, and if that's where it ended, I would judge it simply on that basis. But the fact that this has become a cult hit just baffles me. There are a whole lot of indie films out there made for less money that beat this into the ground. But hey, I can't diss everything about it...there are, in fact, some very GOOD things. The plot is fun and off-beat, the characters are sick, twisted and morally bankrupt, even the dialogue ain't all the bad. But that's where the good stuff ends. Since Clerks is now considered a ""hit,"" let's judge it based on those terms. The acting is horrid. Unbelievably elementary. Auditions, anyone? The best acting involves Jay and Silent Bob standing outside the store jacking around. Anything with dialogue is on par with your local Jr. High School play. And the sad part is, had Smith edited a little better, he could've at least improved the dialogue a little. It seems like they did about two takes a scene -- most of which were long running dialogues with a locked-off camera -- then apparently gave themselves about a day to edit the whole darn thing. The entire film is a compilation of two-shots...they rarely cut to someone reacting to what another person is saying, and the term ""over the shoulder shot"" seems to be lost on Smith. The shots are flat, most dead-on straight, the camera finds nothing interesting in the scenes, nor does it work hard to put the scene in context or create a mood. These guys went to a lot of work to create something that looks like it took no work whatsoever. In short, A for effort, given that he was a new director and had no cash. But this should've remained exactly as it was meant to be: an application form for Tinseltown. For my money, Smith should've stuck to writing, and left directing to people with eyes.",1141084800,9,2060,4.493333333333333
653734,5,6303430570,"No matter how many times I watch Clerks, it is just as funny and good as it was the first time. The movie is fun and foul-mouthed, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It shows that life isn't always an easy street, but it is full of struggle. No one has learned this in one day more than Dante Hicks, a store clerk who isn't even supposed to work today, and who doesn't let his buddy Randal or the audience forget it.

The acting in this brilliant film is fantastic, everyone takes to their role and are very believable people. Being 22 years old, the story sadly relates to my life in more ways than one. Jay and Silent Bob were spawned from this flick, they are quite possibly the greatest duo to grace the silver screen, call it fanboyism but I don't care. This movie just speaks to everyone and it's something everyone can relate to, that's why this film will be around forever and will gain new fans every day.

653735,5,6303430570,"To anyone who's seen the movie, that line makes sense.

Of all the movie's that Kevin Smith has made, this one if by far the best. People say it's overrated, including Kevin Smith, if you caught the interviews on the Chasing Amy disc.

What makes this movie great? First of all, I like the fact that it was shot on a next to nothing budget. No-name actors go hand in hand with the budget. The blatant mistakes on screen don't bother me; I think that these imperfections add to the whole ""indie film"" experience of this movie.

The next thing that's great is, of course, the story. A slacker 20-something gets called early in the morning to fill in at a job he hates. But relax, he only has to work until noon.

Upon getting to work, things start to go wrong, in the form of chewing gum jammed in the padlocks of the store's protective shutters. So, to assure customers that the store is open, Dante, the pseudo-protagonist of the story, makes a sign out a tarp and shoe polish. So begins his tortured day.

The person scheduled to work at noon doesn't show up. In fact, he leaves the state. So, Dante gets stuck working later than planned. He did have a hockey game scheduled... so on, and so on, and bad things happen to Dante. Worst synopsis ever.

The other really captivating thing was the dialogue. The characters in the movie seem to take the simplest things and add a new level of intelligence to it.

-Can the independent contractors constructing the Death Star be considered ""innocents"" when the Death Star was destroyed in The Empire Strikes Back?

 -What counts as infidelity?

 -Is it ethical to simply close a store for a hockey game?

This is also Jay and Silent Bob's first movie. For the most part, they hang around in front of the convenience store where Dante works. The events that follow are essentially a conversation involving a Russian metal singer, lots of cursing, and the roots of Jay's ambiguous sexuality.

If you think this review makes the film sound terrible, you might be right. It's hard to write a review that encompasses how great this film truly is. You have to see it to know its value. So do that.",1140134400,3,2135,4.514285714285714

The characters are all likeable and flawed, and to anyone who went to a public high school, you will surely recognize some of your friends (and enemies) in these characters. The insights they offer are crude and crass at times, but nearly always funny and memorable.

The big disappointment is with the bonus features. Kevin Smith truly made a masterpiece with this simple black-and-white movie, which is, by no stretch, one of the best movies of the 1990's. Unfortunately, Kevin and the other cast members seem so impressed with themselves that they just talk and talk and talk about how great they are. ""The snowball effect,"" which others rave about (I don't know why), is a waste of time. The cast interviews are merely a testament to how well written the movie must have been to succeed despite only having two people (Dante and Veronica) who know how to act. Smith and his admiring cast drone on about how great this movie was, how great being a slacker was, how cool they were when they were high, how great blah blah blah. You learn what huge egos everyone has, and how greatly impressed they all are with themselves. They spend lots of time stroking their own and each others pride, but you are never really treated to insights about THE MOVIE! The extra footage and the extra features are huge disappointments, and the commentary tracks are just self-indulgent. Kevin Smith's mom says it best, ""You spent $27,000 for this?""

My honest advice? Rent the three-disc edition. Watch Kevin Smith's ""introductions"" to various parts of the DVDs, and if you actually like it, think about getting the three disc edition. Otherwise, you can get the same movie on DVD (1-disc edition) or on VHS for half the price. The picture quality/sound quality is no different, as it's a low budget black and white film.

However, in the span of a work day Dante and the other eclectic patrons, friends, ex's, groupies, and fellow clerks experience almost all of the ups and downs that life has to offer.

Kevin Smith successfully placed the everyday convenient store in the social conscious with this film as a place of all kinds of emotions.  He accomplishes this with ruggedness, which is equally opposed by wit.  You feel for the characters, and you'll laugh at the humor, but mainly it is a simple story of life boiled down to a clerk's job.

""Clerks"" was the first Kevin Smith movie I ever saw, and I guess it still holds a special place in my heart. The script is by the funniest thing Smith has written, we meet our heros Jay and Silent Bob for the first time, Dante and Randal are hilarious, and the situations the characters are put in are just out and out funny. Only Smith's experience working at a Quick Stop in New Jersey could have helped him write such a funny movie (which if you read the booklet with the DVD Smith says himself.)

The tenth anniversary addition is well worth owning, even if you already have the movie. The bonuses are a great buy for the price. Disc one is of course the full theatrical version of ""Clerks"", Disc two is the first cut of the movie which is fun to watch if you've already seen it to see what's left out or changed, and disc three is all about the story of ""Clerks"". If you don't already own the movie, you now have even more motavation to buy the anniversary addition. For those who haven't seen the movie, ""Clerks"" is a story about a guy named Dante. Dante works at a convience store called, oddly enough, Quick Stop. The movie follows his odd encounters of working behind the counter dealing with troublesome customers and annoying bosses. His buddy Randal works at the video store next door to the Quick Stop (both owned by the same owner) and frequently comes in to stir some things up. The ideas and situations in the movie are just so funny, and so true to life, that everyone can appreciate what Dante is going through. The hilariously funny dou of Jay and Silent Bob only add to the laughs even more.

I strongly encourage you to buy this DVD. Even if you already own it, the bonuses are just too good to pass up. And with a price tag of around $20 (considering that you buy it from somewhere like Wal-mart or Target) is well worth the price of admission. If you love Kevin Smith movies, or Jay and Silent Bob, and somehow all the years you've just managed to elude ""Clerks"", then what are you doing still reading this?

Sure the movie takes place nearly entirely inside of a convenience store but through the characters that we meet we feel that we are travelling outside the store meeting all sorts of weird an something along the lines of idiotic people. Of course we don't have to travel because all the weirdos come into the store and challange on a relentless basis Dante the store clerk and Randal the clerk of a video store next door who spends all his time inside the convenience store hanging with Dante.

The quality of the dialogue is similar to Tarantino in the way that characters don't really talk about anything in particular that is plot defining at the time but later we learn that it was all intricately placed. Sometimes hilarious, crude, annoying and above all else real. We believe the characters, this is dialogue that people use in everyday life. This is the way people behave in everyday life and it is so refreshing to see something like this on screen even though it for me it came 10 years late.

People relate to this film, I certainly do. Im sure at one point or another we were young, working somewhere that we didn't want to be working and going nowhere fast while it seemed everyone else was going places. This is the true essense of the film, its abily to relate to a large audience out there. It sure has related to me in a big way. One of my favorite films ever and higly recommened.",1097452800,8,2260,4.386634844868735

Case in point:

Disc One contains the original version of the film with the classic commentary track from the first DVD release, for purists.

Also on the first disc is an animated short about what really happened at the funeral, a short film called Flying Cars featuring Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran (Randal and Dante from Clerks), and all the MTV spots the the terrible twosome Jay and Silent Bob appeared in.

Disc Two features the first cut of the film that appeared at Sundance before Mirimax optioned the film and added a new soundtrack. It also features a new commentary track with Kevin and all the usual suspects, and a feature where you can actually watch the commentators rather than the film if you so desire.

The third disc sports a ton of extra material, including a bit on the restoration of the film, a documentary on how Kevin became the director we all know and love, the student film by Kevin and Scott Mosier, and a Q&A with the cast and crew for the tenth anniversary. The questions asked at the Q&A were a bit dissappointing, but Kevin and his cohorts maintain their usual level of wit.",1096502400,7,1295,4.637554585152839
654065,5,6303430570,"Clerks is the little film that could. Made with a shoestring budget using black & white 16mm film stock, Clerks is the shining example of how a film with no funding or exposure can achieve success with great writing, an original premise, and word-of-mouth buzz.

Since 1994 Clerks has become a gigantic cult hit, and Miramax did a great thing by releasing this 10 year anniversary set, for it contains tons of extras, more than enough for any Clerks fan to crap his pants in joy. The second disc contains the first cut of Clerks, with extra footage. The extras disc has a whopping hour and a half documentary taking the viewer from Kevin Smith's childhood all the way through the making of Clerks and it's purchase by Miramax. There is an animated version of ""the lost scene"" at the Wake. There is also a Q&A with Kevin Smith and cast, Kevin Smith's journals, and even his student film from his days at the Vancouver Film School.

The picture quality for the first cut is grainy, but the quality of the theatrical cut is superb, and will probably be the best Clerks will ever look since it was originally shot on 16mm.

Anyone who is a fan of Clerks should definitely pick this up, it gives you a new perspective on the film and lets you in on the behind the scenes details on the making of the movie. If you are new to Clerks, you should also pick this up, for it is only slightly more expensive than the regular DVD but has superior quality and tons of extras.",1096156800,2,1462,4.407407407407407

Anyway, I'm here to talk to film Auteurs anyway. If you want to know how to make your own film, on your own budget and make it big in Hollywood, this is the film for you. This film was made on a budget that included nothing more than maxed out credit cards and a sold comic book collection. And while you can tell that it was a cheap film, it's not the camera work that makes you enthralled with this movie, it's the dialogue which is fresh and whitty.

And in this anniversary edition you'll find it all, even a documentary about the film making of Clerks that cost more than the movie itself!!! On the DVD ROM they've got the 168 page original screenplay for the film.

One day my friend comes over with this movie, says it's funny but it's in black and white.  I didn't think this movie would be all that good, but since I love, crude and sexual humor alot, this movie was just my ticket for comedy.

This was a independent low-budget film with a lot of petential inside it.  Joke after joke in this movie, I found myself laughing over and over again.

And it has a feel to it, as if, this could accually happen to a couple of people running a couple of convineonce stores.

It does a superb, hilarious job of how a lot of bad things can happen to someone who isn't suppose to be at work that day(Donte), and a man who is just a let's everything loose at the costomers that come in his, or his friends Donte's store(Randal).

I'll be keeping my old DVD because, while the deleted scenes on the old DVD are included in the first cut of the movie on disc 2 of this set (plus many other differences from the theatrical release), the first cut was taken from the SVHS copy submitted to IFFM for review, which means the video and audio quality is not very good (I guess no better copy was available of that version, so this is mainly for historical interest), and the deleted scenes on the old DVD are actually of better quality.  Also, Kevin Smith's introductions to each deleted scene on the old DVD are unique to that release, too (if that matters to you), although some elements are reflected in the new commentary track accompanying the first cut in this set.  So, unless I get hard up for cash some day, I'll hang on to my old DVD yet.  But, even if these aren't reasons enough for you to keep your old DVD, this 10th anniversary set is still worth getting for the restoration of the theatrical version, the historically interesting first cut, the documentary, and the slew of other goodies in this set -- you can always give your old DVD to a friend, or whatever.

654070,4,6303430570,"Kevin Smith's first film Clerks.  The first time we'd see the mildly-entertaining Jay and Silent Bob.

This show had some good lines in it, but all in all, it wasn't that good.  The guy who ran the video store was okay I thought, until I saw his same character in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" - then I realized how much of a dork he was.  As for the guy who ran the Quick-Stop Store - I've never been one to watch shows about pathetic people.  I love to make fun of them in real life, so why would I want to watch them in movies?

The scene where the customer is asking the video-store guy about some movies she wants to rent, and the guy isn't paying attention is classic.  I've ripped off the ""You gotta tear into the occasional customer"" line so many times to my fellow co-workers, so I have Clerks to thank for that.

As far as the store workers' love spats go, it's just boring.  I mean maybe it was meant to shock the first-time viewer, but it just makes the movie that much more boring when you watch again and again.

As far as the extras on this DVD goes, there are three discs for this release.  I read from a source that they spent $200,000 on one of the documentaries on this set called 'Snowball Effect' (which is reference to a gross-situation in the film, which I've heard about in real life).  Some may say:  ""Wow, $200,000, but they only spent $28,000 to make the film!""",1095033600,,1391,4.223484848484849
654071,5,6303430570,"History

So it's been ten years since the little indy film that could won the Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals.  Back then, no one knew who Kevin Smith was, and if someone were to utter the names ""Jay and Silent Bob"", they wouldn't have any meaning at all.  Back then, Smith was a comic-book-collecting convenience store worker with dreams of becoming a screenwriter (he had already written Dogma, but he decided to shelve it until he became a competant film maker).  He decided to make a movie about his job, the clerk at a local convenience store.  He cast his friends in the main roles, many of whom had never acted before, and, if this movie had never been made, probably never would have been in a movie (Jason Mewes was left of the promotional materials because ad execs thought he was too ""strange-looking"").  He paid for this movie with his credit cards and loans from friends.  It cost just under $27,000, and had it been any more expensive, it probably wouldn't have been made.

Plot

The ""story"" revolves around Dante Hicks (Brian o'Halloran), a clerk at a Quick Stop in New Jersey.  Dante is a slacker who, despite hating his career, won't do anything to improve his situation.  His best friend/worst enemy Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) works at the video store next to the Quick Stop and is an even bigger slacker than Dante.  Not only that, but where Dante is professional (most of the time) and a pushover, Randal lets no one take advantage of him, and he takes every opportunity to insult, degrade, offend, and embarass the customers of both stores.  Outside the stores reside drug dealing buddies Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), who scare away customers as well as pester the clerks.  Finally, the two women in Dante's life round out the cast.  There is his girlfriend Veronica Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) who is a very committed girl with some ""dirty laundry"" that Dante has trouble accepting.  Then, there is his old flame Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer).  When they were dating, she cheated on him 8.5 times (Dante explains the half time to Randal), yet he can't get her out of his system.  As the day goes on, many surreal, bizzare, and downright hilarious events occur, such as the gum rep who pretends to be a normal customer, the hockey game on the roof, the ""shell-shocked"" guidance counselor, a botched funeral, and the sale of tobacco to a four-year-old girl.  And the best part is, this was supposed to be Dante's day off!

Acting

This is definitely the movie's weakest point.  As I said earlier, many of these people had never acted before, and it is apparent.  Many times, it seems that the actors aren't interacting, they are merely reciting their lines.  As distracting as this can be, it doesn't affect the movie too terribly.

Extras

On this 10th Anniversary edition, we are treated to more extra material than we know what to do with.  There are two cuts of the film, the theatrical cut and the director's cut.  As of writing this review, I have only watched the theatrical cut, but I did watch the end of the director's cut in order to see the extended ending.  Let me say two things about the extended cut: 1. The video and audio are far inferior to the normal cut.  2. I'm glad Kevin Smith decided not to use the extended ending of the film.  While it did provide a good deal of irony, it was extremely depressing and it wasn't done very well either.  Another extra is the ""lost scence"" that took place within the funeral home.  There is an intro by Smith and Scott Mosier (the producer) explaining why it was cut.  The scene is animated, in the style of the Clerks cartoon, and it does get some laughs.  Not only that, but it introduces Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a character who is only alluded to in this movie (she is introduced in Chasing Amy).  However, I think that Kevin Smith was right when he said that, maybe things were better left to our imagination.

Conclusion

This is a very funny movie from a writer/director/actor whose early work is somewhat underappreciated.  Although, from what I've heard, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma are the best films he's made, while Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Jersey Girl were all so-so or bad.  Smith is obviously a competent writer.  This film is definitely worth a look if you've never seen it before.  Be warned however; there is almost non-stop profanity and sexual allusions.",1094774400,15,4401,4.6697009102730815

654141,3,6303430570,"In 1994 a small black & white success story of a film ended up taking home awards from both Cannes and Sundance all while staying on a meager budget and having nearly zero content.  That movie was Clerks, loved by teens and stoners alike, which combines witty dialogue with the wonderful feeling that grows inside any person who's ever worked retail before and wishes they could do what these guys do.

Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) had a decent life, just not much of a future: he has a great and beautiful girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) but he lives at home and works full time at a the local Quik Stop Convenience Store.  His best friend Randall Graves (Jeff Anderson) is even worse, making Dante's life look incredible by the fact that Randall doesn't have a girl, can't manage to open RST Video on time (11:00 AM), and keeps the store locked half the time because he's next door talking to Randall.  As boring as the plotline sounds, this movie has it all.  The incredible events that occur combined with witty dialogue on truly ascenine situations not only amuses smart @$$es everywhere but ends up teaching us life lessons in the process.

Considering the incredible feats that Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier did to put this movie together in such a great way on such a small budget you truly have to stand back in awe.  Kevin Smith has a knack for witty dialogue and he's got this way of making all his lowlife characters that seem on the bottom rung of the ladder life speak like they're educated scholars of english.  The character development can be weak at times, especially with the odd ways Smith goes about doing this (ex: we learn of Dante's defeatest attitude during a discussion of why Empire Strikes Back is the better of the Star Wars Trilogy) but he meant well.  His responses can also be hokey and sometimes obviously fake or forced just make his joke happen, which I didn't notice when I was 15 but is much more apparent now.  The movie is clearly rough, and Smith will be the first to tell you that this film is filled with flaws, but this IS his first attempt at a film so it is to be expected.  I personally want to give this movie four stars, but as I get older and show it to a more diverse crowd it's becoming obvious to me that the endless banter in a script that goes nowhere and its characters riding along with it that general audiences may not appreciate this film quite as much as me and my friends.

The DVD is quite impressive for an independent Miramax $27,000 film (kinda makes me want them to drop the price now that I think about it) and ignoring my side comments about the price is definitely worth the money for fans and those who are entertained by this fun and clever film.  The picture looks horrendously grainy and for those fans of DVD that expect everything to look like Episode II or T2: Ultimate Edition, this will let you down.  As I describe in my Chasing Amy review, the filmstock used was a weak 16mm black and white stock and therefore will appear grainy even though the transfer is a super sharp 100% digital signal.  You can't IMPROVE the quality of film already shot and without a professional 35mm camera and matching $1,000 per foot film you'll never get the quality that today's high budget films present and this movie has equal quality to a student filmstock!  The special features explore the other directions he was going with the film and has some fun featurettes and DVD info for fans.  If you know this film and like it, you probably already own it.  If you're not sure about Smith or if you found Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back to be his only good film (but you also kinda liked Mallrats) I'd definitely recommend this as a rental because it does deliver the jokes from those films but the style is definitely more independent and (dare I say it) has more depth.

654143,5,6303430570,"""Clerks,"" director/writer Kevin Smith's film-making debut, shot after-hours in the convenience store he worked in, on a shoe-string budget, with various friends playing random parts, is pure comic gold. It has struck a chord with so many people (mostly Gen-X slackers) for a reason: it's honest, and unrelentingly hilarious. Shot in completely black & white, ""Clerks"" has a down-home, gritty feeling that works well (even if unintentionally) with the tone of the film. The movie revolves around a day in the life of two clerks who also happen to be friends: Dante, who runs the convenience store (Quik Stop), is a self-pitying everyday joe, stuck in a rut. Randall is almost his polar opposite. He runs the video-store next door and although both hate their jobs, Randall seems to find the fun in it, while Dante seems to focus on the drama of everything in his life --from arguing with his girlfriend about school, to pining for a past flame, to simply being degraded on a day to day basis. Most of their time is spent inside Quik Stop, while Randall keeps would-be customers locked outside for half of the day. They anger customers with their foul language (well, Randall does), they close the store to play hockey on the roof (only to return 12 minutes later after losing the ball) and to go to a wake, learn about ""snowballing"" and even find a surprise in the employee bathroom. For all of it's vulgar humor, ""Clerks"" is very easy to relate to and enjoy, and for anyone who has had a job serving the public, much of what is presented in this movie rings true. This movie is a landmark to not only me, but to every Kevin Smith fan. His great sense of humor and talent for writing interesting dialogue for his characters is all established in this one movie. Not to mention it also marks the debut of the infamous Jay & Silent Bob. If you hate your job, or are finding yourself in a rut, ""Clerks"" may be the movie you need to see. The DVD is only satisfactory. The alternate ending is, well, interesting to say the least, and the commentary with Kevin Smith & crew is always interesting -- be sure to keep an ear out for Jason Mewes (Jay) falling asleep during the recording session.",1092614400,3,2185,4.59079283887468

When I first saw it I was still working in retail and laughed so hard I thought I was going to be sick. I loved the DVD version which has the original ending. (Won't give it away if you haven't seen it). I thought that the original ending would have been better. Just that extra punctuation to the day.

Granted,Clerks will have you laughing from beginning to end(such phrases as Chewlies Gum,37,____mopper,Berzerker,shoe polish,& salsa shark bring to mind this film),but it's the look at Gen X 20-somethings in the 90's. The bad job, stagnation and indecisiveness of life at that age.

 Brian O'Halloran plays Dante Hicks,the convienience store jockey with all the whiny""I HATE MY LIFE BUT DON""T WANT TO CHANGE IT"" attitude heard among Gen-Xer's. But Randell Graves (Jeff Anderson ) the clerk at the ajacent video store and the ultimate slacker. He hates his job, but not his life. He disregards his responsibility to his job because he knows it's a dead end and just something to do in the meanwhile.

 After a day in the life of Dante where he's conned and complaining about working on his day off(as well as other bizarre circumstances)Randell sets Dante straight telling him that he overdramatise things to make his life seem more interesting than what it is.

 Kevin Smith is a genius. Even though his movies fall on the wayside sometimes(Mallrats,Dogma),his skewed vision has brought him a following.

Everyone I have recommended it to has loved it and I can easily see why. I know that some people attack the movie as being vulgar and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper).

654209,3,6303430570,"Getting this movie caused a lot of arguments. In the UK, we tend to pronounce it with an 'a' - so Clarks! But I'm being American, so I pronounce it Clerks, which sounds right to me, but wrong to everyone else. So I still say ""clerks"" but then correct myself afterwards. (Hey, I'm easily confused, they say ""clerks"" in the damn movie!)
If you've ever worked as a 'clerk', then you'll really identify with this film. I'm currently working as a waitress, so I didn't identify so much with Dante (although I do get a lot of stupid questions), but I did see a lot of a guy I know, who works in a video store, in Randal, the video store clerk! Much of his lines resulted in me laughing out loud, and saying that they were exactly the same! (Or I imagine them to be the same). My favourite line has to be where Dante says to Randal that he has a customer, and he turns round, with this expression on his face, and says ""What? What do you want?""
This was one of the first outings for Jay & Silent Bob, who are both legends. I already have Chasing Amy, Dogma, and now this on DVD, and am now after Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back (I've seen it, just don't have it), and Mallrats. Both of which are proving very hard to get hold of, particularly Mallrats. I officially love Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith), and despite him speaking in nearly every film in which he plays Silent Bob, I still get a shock when he does speak!
This film is very low budget, and filmed entirely in black & white - which really annoyed me, as I thought my DVD player had gone wrong! (I've actually watched a whole film in black & white - 8 Mile - thinking it was actually in black & white, but my DVD player had decided to be stupid) The entire production costs for this film were $26,800. Combined, the cost of Clerks production and soundtrack was $50,000. This is approximately the cost per second of making Titanic! Also, there are not a lot of sets, and there are a lot of the same actors included. It's very much a film involving two main characters, who talk back & forth. It can get quite tedious, between funny lines, and Jay dancing and singing (yeh!) yet again!
There's an alternate ending on the DVD, but I have to say I preferred the original ending. There are also a lot of deleted scenes, with introductions from Kevin Smith. I tend to skip most of these, as boy, does this guy like the sound of his own voice!
There are some terrific and extremely quotable lines (if only I could remember them, to quote to people!) in this! Some of the best are:
Dante Hicks: Are there any balls down there?
Jay: About the biggest pair you ever seen, dingleberry!
Randal Graves: You know who I could do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Dante Hicks: Which ones?
Randal Graves: All of them.

There's a few more, but I suppose it depends on your sense of humour.

654211,5,6303430570,"""Clerks"" is a movie written and directed by Kevin Smith. I have almost seen all of Smiths works. He has made six movies in total. The ones I have seen are ""Clerks,"" ""Mallrats,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Dogma,"" and ""Jersey Girl."" The one I didn't see was ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" but I plan on seeing that. I have already rewarded ""Dogma"" with five stars, and this is probably the second best movie that he has made. The difference is that this movie is probably more realistic. The entire movie is just conversations between these characters except for one scene one the roof with a hockey match. The entire film is shot in black and white and the movie works better with the black and white. The color could describe the lives of the characters. There lives aren't so great to have everything in color, and the black and white shows how everything is the same. Every day for these characters is the same. ""Clerks"" is hilarious, fun, and provides some very insightful dialouge. Interesting dialouge is things about ""Star Wars"", the customers, and just everyday things. It is very interesting to hear what these people have to say. They are saying things that me and you would say.
The movie is a day in the life of two grocery store clerks. Dante and Randall. Dante has to get up every mourning, clean the grafitti off the side of the store, and have to deal with various customers. Some make him angry, and some of the them aren't a problem at all. Randall is the wise cracking and insightful guy who works right next door at the video store. The only thing is, he works in the video store, but he is always hanging out with Dante at the grocery store with the name Quick Stop. Throughout the movie, we get a look at the character's personal lives. Dante is dating Veronica Loughran, but he really wants to go out with Caitlin Bree, who he has liked since high school. As the day goes on, Dante and Randall have encounters with a hocket game that Dante has to go play, a funeral, and Jay and Silent Bob, who are two drug addicts. Jay, who is always talking and using profanity in his dialouge, while Silent Bob never talks. Every now and then he'll say one word or so, but mostly he just stands there and smokes with Jay. Dante knows that the day will end soon, but it's getting there that'll be hard.
""Clerks"" was a great movie. It was one of the most entertaining movies that I have ever seen, and at a 90 minute running time, it felt that it was very fast. Some of the conversations were very interesting, my favorite being the one about Star Wars, and which movie is better. ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" or ""Return of the Jedi."" It is very interesting to hear what Dante and Randall have to say about each movie. ""Clerks"" has been around for about ten years now, and a Ten Year Anniversary DVD is coming this year. Be sure to check it out once it comes out. The movie was originally going to be NC-17 only because of the dialouge, but an appeal brought it down to an R. I didn't think that the dialouge was that bad or explicit, but in 1994 it was a different time, and this movie is very different from others.
ENJOY!

654213,4,6303430570,"Clerks was a low-budget movie, lacks any special effects and was shot in black and white. That all works perfectly in this case though. Clever dialogue between the main characters and the wide variety of customers they encounter while at work make this movie very worthwhile seeing. No, there is no real plot but it surrounds Dante and Randall at work one day. Dante runs the convenience store on a day when he is supposed to be off, since his boss left town. Randall runs the crappy video store next door, but rarely stays there. He is usually in the store offending customers and it is just hilarious. For anyone who has ever had a job dealing with customers like that, you know how tempting it is to say what you want to the customers. Many humorous things go on in the store such as Randall selling cigarettes to a 5 year old, Dante and Randall attending a funeral only to knock over the casket within 5 minutes, and Dante closing the store to play hockey on the roof. There are so many classic lines in the movie such as the one we all know, ""I'm not even supposed to be here today."" When the two have a conversation about Star Wars with a customer, more like a serious discussion I was cracked up. So you have an everyday situation with believable things that happen between the workers and the customers, witty dialogue with many memorable lines (""This job would be great if it weren't for the f****** customers""), and to top it off a few great scenes with Jay and Silent Bob. This movie is not centered on those two, but Dante and Randall and the everyday battle with customers that will crack you up for sure. This is just an ordinary low-budget movie made great by the dialogue, but at the same time it is what a movie should be---entertaining. Kevin Smith has made some great movies, but this one is my favorite. It is an amazing movie considering Smith worked with so little money to make this great film. So you should watch this no matter what at least once. If you work in a store like Dante or a video store like Randall, I'm sure you will appreciate the humor in their way with saying what they want to customers even if it is offensive. It is a normal and believable situation that doesn't fail to entertain, and has everything you want to say to a customer but can't.",1087689600,,2286,4.40661938534279

Plot Summary: Two guys spend a day at work in adjacent stores, and a lot of weird things happen.
Review and Comments: Like that summary? Very concise. The problem with writing a review of this movie is that what happens is an overview of a day at work for these two characters, and anything I say can and will ruin the jokes that make this film worth seeing. I'll attempt to apply my vast amounts of reviewing skill to this review in order to convince you why this movie is worth seeing WITHOUT giving away every single thing that happens.
So. Has anyone here ever worked a crappy, low-paying service job that required immense amounts of patience and customer service skills not to wring the necks of everyone that came into the place asking stupid questions? This movie is for you. Here lies a collection of anecdotes about all the things that can happen throughout the years working at a convenience store (and a video rental place) all set in the timeframe of one incredible day at work. The customers that ask stupid questions, the things that break and must be fixed, everything that can and will go wrong at once, it's all here. To give away the little things that happen would be to rob the viewer of the enjoyment of watching it happen, so I'll say no more. There are several exaggerated things that happen, comedic moments that we hope are fictional, but at its core what works about the comedy is that there are recognizable hilarious moments that we recognize if we've worked these kinds of jobs before.
Holding this film together, there is a relationship between the main character, Dante, (played by Brian O'Halloran) and his girlfriend Marilyn, (played by Veronica Loughran). Their relationship has lasted awhile, and they're hitting some rough spots in trying to see whether it should continue or end immediately. Most relationships hit such a spot, and the revelations they make to each other and the reactions that occur should be recognizable to anyone who's ever had a relationship that hit some rough spots (""I can't believe you never told me that..."" ""You're overreacting...""). Again, I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that much of the dialogue here is funny because it's true.
So throughout the day, strange things happen, the main characters react, and the relationship problems are discussed. The problems get worse, the tension mounts, and at the end, everything is resolved in such a way that the characters may or may not have learned something. The plot follows the standard film school outline, but the twist is that the whole story occurs in the midst of vignettes that follow the quirky things that can happen throughout a day at a customer service job (with a few fantastical, exaggerated situations) and the little stories are interwoven with the main character's dilemma in a way that I found highly entertaining.
The grainy, black and white style of this movie (slightly above surveillance camera quality...no joke) belies the small budget, but I found it effective. It may annoy a lot of people, though, so be forewarned. This movie doesn't look slick and polished. This movie is full of ""inappropriate"" language. Don't let your four-year-old watch this movie unless you want him to get kicked out or preschool for repeating the dialogue. Lots of people don't like this movie (or any of Smith's movies, come to think of it) because they complain that it has no plot and it's not funny-it's annoying. Keep that in mind. If you don't like the comedy, you won't like the movie.
The Bottom Line: I loved it.",1086048000,,3861,4.851515151515152
654216,5,6303430570,"The highly talked about movie ""Clerks"" was an independent film that Kevin Smith funded with ten credit cards, by selling his comic book collection, money from an insurance claim, money from his friends, and from paychecks working at Quick Stop. I expected the film to be comedic, mostly because anything with Jay and Silent Bob is hilarious. Clerks started out at the IFFM (Independent Feature Film Market) where it was viewed and liked by Bob Hawk, a member of the Sundance Advisory Committee. It was then shown at Sundance in 1994 where Miramax Films picked it up. From there they did advertising.
 The movie is a comedy and has a relationship story with the main character caught between two girls. His old high school sweetheart and his current girlfriend. The movie is basically about Dante who is somewhat of a loser by society's standards. He works at a local Quick Stop and comes across several characters including Jay and Silent Bob. The love story is what holds the movie together and gives it some body. Without it the movie would have been a disaster. The movie gives you relaxed vibes and has a chilled out atmosphere about it, which is helped by the great soundtrack.
 The main characters are Dante, Randal, Veronica, Caitlin and Silent Bob. Jay (Jason Mewes) dances around like an idiot and sells drugs; Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), of course, just stands there. Dante (Brian O' Halloran) thinks he is really something special and that his job needs him. He thinks he's the only man for the job and things will fall apart without him. Randal (Jeff Anderson) recognizes that anyone can do their job and that they are just two losers working at a video and local liquor store. The acting isn't super but I think its meets the standards for an independent flick.
 This of course was Kevin Smith's first movie. He is also known for his other works titled, ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Mallrats"". The film does get somewhat slow during some parts, such as the love scenes but I think its somewhat unavoidable when it comes to those things. The film was all black and white with settings in the Video Store, the Quick Stop along with the roof, outside the Quick Stop and at Dante's House. Technical camera angles weren't really in effect due to the fact that it was an Independent film and released back in 1994.
  All in all I enjoyed the film. The good points had to be the classic petty arguments and wide range of vocabulary used in Kevin Smith films and Jay's crazy antics. The only bad point for me was the black and white. Some people might like it but I'm a man of the color age. If your into comedy and you enjoy any of the other Kevin Smith films this movie is a must see!",1078790400,2,2679,4.572916666666667
654286,4,6303430570,"If you look at this movie the right way, it is impressive.  In particular, it shows how to break into hollywood on a shoestring budget.  Does the script take a lot of cheesy cheapshots?  Sure. Which is a means to an end wrt achieving that ""entertainment value thing"" for the average viewer.  This movie led to so many others & helped create enough real stars that it's almost a classic textbook example of how to break into hollywood without directly going through hollywood.

The thing Randal says about working would be great if there were no customers is soo true. Another thing this movie points out is how many things can happen in one day, its amazoning; i've never seen such a sequential movie like this before.

654288,1,6303430570,"First off, I'd just like to say that I'm a huge fan of most of Kevin Smith's work and usually love every View Askew film, but there's something about Clerks that I just never liked. Perhaps it was the fact that the whole film is black and white, or maybe it's because the plot was pointless and dumb. Actually, most View Askew films have a dumb plot, but Kevin Smith usually always finds a way to make them funny. Smith failed here, because Clerks rarely made me laugh.
(*Small spoilers*)
The plot is about two Clerks named Dante and Randall who work in a convienince store. Randall can be funny at times, but it seems like Dante is just whiny throughout the whole film and really makes me despise this movie. Throughout the day, Dante and Randall basically just talk to each other about different topics, such as the dangers of working on the death star in Star Wars, Caitlin Bree (Dante's ex-girlfriend), and how Dante finds the customers to be annoying. The whole film is basically just two guys sitting behind a counter and rambling on about stuff that no one even cares about. I'm sorry, but I really have no idea how this film became so popular and why some consider it to be ""Groundbreaking"".

Many of the characters become recycled in the follow up films to rehash the empire of brilliant personalities.  Jay and Silent Bob are the two definate stand outs that come to be used numerous times in the other Kevin Smith films, after watching Clerks you will understand why.
Clerks is fully filmed in Black and White, no Dolby 5.1 surround, no special effects, not even marquee actors.  This film is totally dependant on character interaction and secondmost, the storyline.  Entertaining to the Nth degree, the interaction of the primary two characters Randall and Dante guide you through their day in the life of a Video store and a Convenience store clerk.

Clerks is witty, sharply and cleverly written, with energetically laid-back performances. It's structured as vignettes, or screen cuts if you will, from the lives of two retail clerks -- one a general store and the other a video rental -- and the moments spent in their day to day life, the oddball customers they frequently deal with, the doozy way they themselves handle their customers etc.

He is a whiny, goody two shoes, that puts up with all of the customer's crap. The day before, he had to work an open to close shift. The boss called him on his day off, and promised that he would be in at 12:00 noon to take over. He stands Dante up, making him work back to back open-to-close shifts. ""But I'm not even supposed to be here today!"" Next you have Randal. Randal works next door at the video store. Randal goes out of his way to upset customers and does what he wants, when he wants. Everything from spitting water in their faces, to watching pornography in the store. Randal and Dante make the perfect pair. They are so different, but make you laugh the same. ""Clerks"" also marks the first time appearance of the two lazy drug dealers named Jay ( Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob ( Kevin Smith). They either stand around outside and sell, or come in and make Dante and Randall miserable. Thrown into the mix are the two most important women in Dante's life. There is his ex girlfriend Katlin (Lisa Spoonhauer)who cheated on Dante nine times, and is getting married. Despite all the bad treatment, Dante still wants her. Then there is his present girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti). She loves Dante dearly, and is the best choice. But she unfortunately has a long lost of ex boyfriends, that has caused her to have a high number ""sexual favors"". ""I'm number 37?!!""
Most of the time, people save the best for last. But in this case, Clerks was Kevin Smith's first and best film. In fact, the film almost did not get made. Smith sold his comic book collection for $27,000 to make it happen. That makes "" Clerks"" one of the most profitable films ever made. The story is one that anyone can relate to. It is every person's dream to be able to tell the customers what you think of them, and do anything that you want when you are working. This is the reason why the film is so funny. It offers a no holds barred look at perfecting the art of ignoring the rule ""the customer is always right"". Jeff Anderson summed up the idea behind the film perfectly when he said ""This job would be great, if it weren't for the customers"". The film is shot brilliantly because it is in black and white to give the appearance of watching through a security camera. The entire cast did an outstanding job in this film, despite the fact that they were all relatively all unknown.
""Clerks"" is an unforgettable film. The cast is incredible, and the story couldn't be better. The Collector's Series DVD is amazing. Kevin Smith likes to offer the best possible extras. You get commentary from Kevin Smith as well as the cast, deleted scenes, and a hillarious alternate ending. This DVD is a must own, that you can watch over and over again!",1068336000,,2903,4.5

654374,4,6303430570,"This is an indie film (VideoHound gives a $27,575 budget) filmed in not so glorious black and white that is strikingly original, and I mean strikingly, and funny.  Depicting the early twenties slacker set in suburban New Jersey a decade ago, it focuses on convenience store clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), who is adrift in that never-never land between high school and Making Something of Himself.  He still pines for his high school hottie Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), especially when he learns that his current girl friend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) has, shall we say, had intimate rocket knowledge of thirty-seven different guys, although she had sex with only three of them, including him.  Ah, well, what's a snowball or two between friends?
Next door to the convenience store is a video rental store clerked by Dante's best bud, Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson).  Randal scares off the customers, rents his videos elsewhere and just generally slacks off and offends at all times, except when giving career and sexual advice to Dante.  Hanging out outside and dealing are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  Kevin Smith also directed and wrote the script and probably did the catering and clean up as well.  He is one very clever and talented dude who told it like it almost was while mildly satirizing the New Jersey denizens and the slacker mentality, but with affection and a kind of light-hearted aplomb.
There's some absurdity, Caitlin making love to a dead man and not realizing he's dead, the guys playing stick ball hockey on the roof of the convenience store, Randal selling cigs to a four-year-old who lights up, etc., mixed with the pathos of making minimum wage and going nowhere, and some sight gags and a whole lot of spiffy, crude, and dead-panned one-liners.  Nothing is taken too seriously, including Kevin Smith and his film, so that when they run the final credits we are pleased with this slice of indeterminate life in the Garden State.
I was reminded of some other low budget films made about the same time including Bang (1995), Floundering (1994) and The Unbelievable Truth (1990), especially the latter, but none are as outrageously funny as Clerks.  Incidentally, this is currently ranked in IMDb's Top 250.",1061337600,2,2260,4.98936170212766
654375,5,6303430570,"This classic low-budget, rudely humorous, 1994 film was the first done by director Kevin Smith. Most of the movie takes place in a small local convience store. Dante, the only clerk working in their was called in despite the other goings on that were happening that day. His girlfriend comes to cheer him up, only to have him find out that his girlfriend has (well, actually I can't say it here) to multiple other people. To annoy him even more is the irresponsible Randal who works in a video rental store across the street, even though he likes to go to another one miles away and is bearily in the one he works in. Randal spends the whole day pissing off both Dante and the customers, and also trying to get Jay and Silent Bob to stop dealing drugs outside of his video store with their heavy metal singing Russian friend.
Shot in black and white on an extreme low budget, this film would lead Kevin Smith into the mainstream eye, and he would begin to work with big name actors including George Carlin, Chris Rock, even Ben and Matt. With his follow ups Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, he would prove himself as one of the most independently influenced directors iin mainstream Hollywood (these movies are also hilarious). Smith would also continue to star in his moovies as the ever-quiet Silent Bob, who teamed up with his partner Jay (they would become the main interest in the movie because of their quick and vulger humor and classic one-liners).

654440,5,6303430570,"Let's get one thing straight: for the most part, I HATE independent films. Really. When I hear those words, I always think of a five-hour, beatnik-friendly black-and-white film of two french people talking and smoking cigarettes, while their conversation is subtitled in English, and the end card reads ""Fin"". Sometimes I think ""independent film"" refers to the movie being independent from having to make a lick of sense. Yes, this movie is in black-and-white, but in all honestly, that's the only thing it has in common with other ""independent films"". This movie is real, funny, and raw, and it helped to boost the career of a young filmmaker in the rough, Mr. Kevin P. Smith of Red Bank, NJ.
The movie focuses on the comings and goings and comings of the Quick Stop Convienience Store, and its head clerk, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran). It is Dante's day off, but unfortunately for him, he gets called in to work. (I know how that feels, and believe me, it bites.) Hence his catchphrase: ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!"" The next 90 minutes deal with Dante's love life (37?!), his sarcastic (and witty as hell) friend Randal Graves who works at the nearby video store (Jeff Anderson), and of course, the dumb customers he gets. I am a cashier at a grocery store as well, so I know exactly what it's like to have to deal with these people. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten people like that and I just wanted to use one of Randal's lines against them. Also, watch the scene at the video store, when a mother asks Randal for a kid's video for her daughter (who is with her). What ensues... classic. Oh yeah, and how can I forget, this is also the flick that introduced America to Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith). Snoochie Boochie Noochies!
All in all, if you're a cashier/clerk, or even if you're not, this is a great movie, and should be seen by everyone, along with the rest of the movies in the View Askew-niverse.",1059436800,,1946,4.562857142857143
654441,5,6303430570,"Clerks is one of the funniest movies ever. Even for a debut, Kevin Smith proves that he is a comedic genius.
The cast of characters in Clerks is very diverse and realistic. The 'protagonist,' or 'main character' of the movie is Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), who is a college dropout who has no ambition, and overcompensates for having to come to work on his day off (his ctach phrase throughout the movie: ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!""). He's like Holden Caufield: he has potential, he is intelligent, he sees the problems wrong w/ society ""Dealing with every backwards [person] on the planet"" at one day of work, but, like Caufield, feels content with just lamenting about it, even though his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti in her only known movie role), encourages him to get out of the rut he is in and return to school.
Then there is Randall (Jeff Anderson, a regular in Kevin Smith movies), the misanthropic employee of an adjacent video store, who is known for telling off customers, and regularly closing the video store to hang out w/ Dante and harass his customers. In a literary sense, you can see him as Nietzsche: he denounces his fellow man, believes that women are inferior (proven by his bizarre tastes in adult videos) and questions authority. He also tries his best to give his friend, Dante, a sense of direction in his life.
Throughout the movie, you are exposed to Dante's everyday problems, like the struggle of dealing with his situation (working in a convenient store for minimum wage), his girlfriend's rather promiscuous sex life (37!), and the feelings he still has for his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Dante is exposed to a variety of people during his day at work, including a gum representative who incites a riot against cigarettes, his hokcey player friends, former high school classmates, and two regular stoners who spend their time hanging around the store harassing people (Jay and Silent Bob).
Clerks is a comedy classic that will be legendary. The free use of adult language and sexual themes may turn off some people, but the humor of this movie is undeniable. It's hilarious, as it is philosophical. This movie contains many notable quotes, and whether you like it or hate it, you will remember it.",1059350400,,2279,4.876288659793815

I mean Dogma was good, but  a lot of it  wasn't all that funny which would leave that at a 9.1/10. Chasing Amy was good too, but it was my least favorite Jay and Silent Bob movie because they were only in it 1 time which would leave that movie at a 8.9 or a 9.0 out of 10. As for Mallrats that to was an excellent film  , but it just wasn't as good as Clerks. the scene where Jay and Silent  Bob were running from  the LaFours was great and so was the dis on Batman, but Mallrats still wasn't as good as Clerks, I would give it a 9.5/10. As for Jay and Silent Bob Strike back that was equally as good because of the amount of other celeberties (Will Ferell,Jason Biggs,Seann William Scott,Shannon Elizabeth, ,Ben Affleck,Chris Rock and Jamie Kennedy being my personal favorites) (due to the many other good movies they have starred in) Anyway Clerks is on my top 5 best movies.

The movie itself is dialogue propelled, and it works very well.  The jokes are constent yet never getting in the way of the plot.  Smith's direction, often criticized, is rather good here.  The dull setting of the Quick Stop is kept fresh using diferrent locations of the store, both outside and in.
The dvd is also worth getting for the commentary.  Rather than sounding like many of the elitist directors that record commentaries these days, Smith sounds comfortable and casual, as if he was just one of your buddies.",1056240000,,734,4.7936507936507935

Being a former electronics store ""clerk"", I figured the humor in this might appeal more. Clerks really stands apart, and is quite enjoyable. The dialog is actually intelligent and entertaining, not this pseudo-intellectual garbage going around in most movies. And I like how it never really goes too far.
None of the dialog is there just to be there, it's quite believable that these two guys would say all this. Maybe not in one day, but it's a film after all. Entertainment is more important than realism. For anyone who is still empty headed enough to think the clerks at your local store are just slack jawed idiots, this film should be a real eye opener. Kevin Smith himself was a clerk, and the movie was shot where he worked on a shoestring budget. He's also Silent Bob.

654508,4,6303430570,"Even though 'Clerks' will probably go down (amongst critics) as the best Kevin Smith film, I think there's much that can be brought up to argue that. Sure, the fact it was made for merely $27,000 and the fact that it's black & white make it impressive; seeing as how it became (is) so popular so effortlessly. But as attractive as it is for some people, it may not be as pleasing for others. I will say this from the start: Kevin Smith is my favorite director. And I think that's very true for many people; as his infamous character Silent Bob makes him more famous than directing probably ever will. I think there'll be a lot of ""Kevin Smith fans"" that won't appreciate his next movie, 'Jersey Girl' (out at the end of summer). Even though Kevin is my favorite director, he's not my favorite actor. He never talks; how can he be anyone's favorite actor? I think Silent Bob is so admired that it overshadows the fact that he's an inspired director. The simplicity of 'Clerks' makes this movie more than brilliant, in its entirety, but does not make it perfect (in the list of View Askew and/or Kevin Smith movies).
The characters of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) are probably the best character duo to appear in any movie. They are so incredibly different, yet they have almost too much in common for them to like each other. Bothersome or even everyday customers are something that anyone who's worked behind a counter can relate to. The way that Randal deals with those customers is particularly enjoyable; yet no one in their right mind would ever do the things he does (though we can still relate). Dante's troubles are brought out by Randal as the two contrast more and more as the movie goes on. The idea that the film's stupid or a funny-to-watch-when-you're-high-type movie is an ill-advised way to view it. The character's habits bring near perfection to the screen. However, the infamous roles of Jay and Silent Bob are rather weak. They're as funny as they come, but still a bit weak in comparison with the other parts. Now, when you watch movies like 'Dogma' or 'Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back', you can clearly see how Jason Mewes (and even Smith, himself) has matured as an actor. But nevertheless those infamous ""dxck and fart jokes"" still remain the same. The acting from the two girlfriends in the film (Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonauer) takes the cake here. They tackle the late-teen stereotypes with ease. Whether that was intended or not, it works wonders here. They probably make the movie watchable for girls; as 'Clerks' seems to be aimed, mainly, at the male audience. As I've hinted to, the development of Smith and his ""team"" have really progressed with each of his six movies. That is the main reason I cite 'Clerks' as the weaker of the six. But for the type of movie this is: a slacker/deadbeat generation comedy, there is nothing better. This is no question a must-see movie for anyone and everyone out there. And although not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did (and many, many others), you can proudly say you watched it.
On my listmania list for my top 100 movies ever, 'Clerks' sits nonchalantly at around #37; yet it moves up every time I rewrite the list (Mallrats is #1; J&SBSB is #6; Dogma is #8; Amy is #22). Some people might say that too much money can ruin someone. But in Kevin Smith's case, it only makes him better. There has been a constant increase in his films with the acting, directing, and design. Do not let my review lead you to believe this movie is bad. It's not at all. And it's only weak in the universe of View Askew; overall it's noteworthingly intelligent. I give it a strong 4.25 stars, deservingly, as it is better than just a plain 4-star rank. People who give this five stars and just say something to the effect of 'it's the coolest movie because Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious' aren't really aware of what makes a true movie. If you like movies with promise and originality, then 'Clerks' will become an instant favorite of yours. And if you are a Kevin Smith ""fan"" and haven't seen this movie, you're not really a fan. This is where it all started; at a little convenience store in New Jersey (as the Star Wars epoch may cite: the saga begins here). This movie is not perfect; though it's not far from it. And if you haven't seen it at least once, you're missing out on a turning point for film; and a great look into the youthful mind of Kevin Smith.",1049155200,,4451,4.544209215442092

654513,5,6303430570,"One of the most talked about debuts that is loved by both critics and the public, 'Clerks' is Kevin Smith's masterpiece that was made on such a low budget.  The budget might've been low, but the quality turned out to be very high.  If you haven't seen this film yet, then you are missing out big time.  This is the one that started it all, and gave us the impression of a new and talented filmmaker.
Most of the film takes place at a convenient store.  Dante isn't supposed to be working, but he is.  What was supposed to be his day off turns into a day filled with chaos, disaster, and outrageous conflicts, (and all because he decided to come to work).  Randall, who works at the video store, spends most of the time at the convenient store.  He's as rude as they come and isn't afraid to get in a customer's face if he feels the need to do so.  You add all this up along with the crazy shoppers who do nothing but drive the two nuts and you get a film filled with unpredictable twists and hilarity.
Smith's real talent is in his writing.  He is a great director, but he is an even better writer.  The dialogue that you hear from the movie is very realistic. The characters aren't talking for the only purpose of moving the movie along.  They actually talk like you and me talk.  (Well, maybe some of us don't curse as much, but you know what I mean.)  And as outrageous or unbelievable the movie becomes, it is all constructed in a manner in which we could actually see this going on in real life. The writing is effective, the acting is top-notch, and the directing is very well-executed.
The DVD has some cool extra features that are bound to make you happy.  It's not a 'fully-loaded' special edition, but it's a lot better than most of the DVDs that are out right now.  The picture and sound quality is really good, considering how low budget the film was.  Being shot in black and white adds a raw and realistic feel to it that wouldn't had been as affective if it were done in color.  (Yes, it is black and white.  It is black and white because that was how it was shot.  I've read a few reviews saying that they're waiting for a colored version to come out.  No such thing exists.)  The special features are deleted scenes, an alternate ending, audio commentary done by the cast and crew, the theatrical trailer, and a Soul Asylum music video.
'Clerks' is a hilarious film that will surprise you every time.  Be warned, there is a lot of offensive and rude language in it, so if you don't like films with a lot of that then you better skip it.  This is a film that continues to be a favorite of mine and is one I have yet to become sick of.  This is a movie that shows you that while 'serving' you is required in the job, 'liking' you is not.

The characters are simply unbelievable, with all sorts of zingers/puns/""wits"" filling their speeches to the brim(and they speak in COMPLETE and grammatically CORRECT phrases, only filled with F-word here and there as if to make them sound natural), proving over and over again that Kev Smith is a shame of the slacker generation cinematographers.",1042675200,10,515,5.45
654550,4,6303430570,"One day, after an exhaustingly excrutiating day working at the local retail store (I won't say the name, but it rhymes with Shmal-Smart) dealing with insane customers and idiot bosses, I dragged myself to the video store to rent a movie. I found myself in the dollar section, when I spotted ""Clerks"". I'd been told many times over the years that I should watch this flick, but I'd never gotten around to it. So I rented it, figured it'd be good for a laugh. Was it ever. It lifted my spirits in knowing I wasn't alone in thinking the retail world was insane. Dante was the guy I felt like I was and Randall was the guy I wish I could be.
It starts off rather slow, and really doesn't start to pick up until Randall comes into the picture. The interaction between Dante and Randall makes the whole picture, and without either one, the entire movie wouldn't have been as much fun. From Randall's Death Star theory to Dante's ex-girlfriend appearing, from the hockey game to the funeral parlor, to the final confrontation between Dante and Randall, the movie is extremely funny. It does drag in a few spots though, usually when Dante or Randall are separated. Like I said, these two NEED each other.
Also making their first appearance are Jay and Silent Bob, though they are notedly less funny than in their future appearances, but still enjoyable.
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hates their job or likes Kevin Smith movies. Or both.",1042675200,2,1449,4.598455598455598

654552,5,6303430570,"As rude, low-brow, and dirty as his first movie was Kevin Smith captures a certain spark that he would keep for his later movies (with the exception of Mallrats, which was his comic slump) that were later known as the Jersey Trilogy.
  In his first movie, Kevin lets us meet Dante. Dante is the clerk at the local Quick Stop store. He has a girl friend (Veronica,) a pretty good friendship with the next-door, movie store clerk (Randal,) and a pretty good grip on reality.
  The whole film is shot over the course of the day, and we begin with Dante being called into work on his day off.
  He's exhausted from the night before, and has a hockey game that day. The locks on the metal *shudders* are jamed with gum, so there is no sunlight in the store, and he is forced to make a sign to stick to the front of the store (assuring that the store is in-fact open) out of shoe polish, a smell that people comment on almost every five minutes.
  The first customer of the day happens to be a gum representative trying to scare everyone from smoking, and instead, chewing his company's gum. He eventually gets soo many people interested that they start to throw cigarettes at him.
  Later, Dante learns of the sex life of his girlfriend, which shocks and disgusts him to no end.
  Then we meet the later stars of the next couple movies, Jay and Silent Bob. Already we have the main factors of their lives down; the obsession of pot, hot chicks, beer, heavy metal, drug dealing, foul language, and Silent Bob's one line *inlightenment* that we get, sooner or later, in ever movie.
  I don't want to give away the whole movie, but the next hour or so, is one roller coaster after another. Between selling cigs to 4-year-olds, dead ex-girlfriends, hockey games on roof tops, Russian metalheads, weddings, and a lot more, you leave thinking how boring your life is compared to your own.
  Although the sound and picture are definatly not the best, they have to due, since this WAS after all, a cheap, underground movie.
  All together, I'd say that the movie, as a whole, if very entertaining, and extremely funny. Although, there are some plot holes, and short commings, this movie is incredibly insightful and whitty, for a first movie, and show the true genius of Kevin Smith and what to look forward to in the future from him.",1041552000,,2321,4.525179856115108

As qouted in his newest dvd ""An Evening With Kevin Smith"" he says, ""In my world, everyone has really long conversations about interesting [stuff] or just pick apart pop cultur to death and everyone talks in monologue,"". That quote perfectly describes Clerks more than any othe Kevin Smith movie as whether they are talking about their sex life, Star Wars, or annoying costomers, they do it in not only an intellectual way but do it indirectly. Another high point of the movie is the social issues he tries to tackle, as even though he is a smoker, he makes a point about people's isues with smoking going as far as having a four year old succesfully buying ciggarettes at a point. Also, compared to other Kevin Smith movies there is less fart jokes. Overall, while the movie is great the extras are what makes this dvd. Even though Kevin Smith plays a quiet character in his movies, he is the complete opposite as he always talks and talks very informatively about everything. While the actual movie looks bad the deleted scenes are worse but are still entertaining. Especially the alternate ending as it is completely unlike Kevin Smith.

There's not one boring character in this movie; my favorites are Jay and Silent Bob.  The ending, in which Silent Bob finally speaks, is a scream!  Totally realistic look at the nickel-and-dime drudgery of lower-rung retail jobs.",1039996800,,511,5.035714285714286

This might be a turn off for some people but I assure you that what's in the movie is what really counts like story itself, the comedy and everything else.

Yeah, the acting is bad. The sound isn't great. And there are no special effects or big explosions. If that's what you need for a good movie; go rent the fast and the furious.

In fact with so many references to Star Wars in Kevin Smith films (Jay/C-3P0 Silent bob/R2-D2) its no wonder it has become almost as popular.
I enjoy this film because it is subtle but very true. Kevin Smith has a knack for writing films that hit close to home and are down to earth. None of his movies are completely far fetched (Strike Back and Dogma were a little far fetched, but none the less very good movies with Dogma being the better film) Mallrats which is the worst of them all is not nearly as comical or true as Clerks.

654634,5,6303430570,"After seeing all of Kevin Smith's other movies, Clerks was the last one I saw. And I admit, I thought that it would be pretty outdated and probably not AS funny as his other movies (especially the humor from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, his latest and last of his Jersey Trilogy) mainly on the purpose that it's black and white, and seems old and all...but I was wrong. Clerks stands out as one of the funniest comedies available still today, and Kevin Smith's humor hasn't changed a bit, just evolved. Clerks is best compared with ""Office Space"" by Mike Judge (the guy who created Beavis and Butt-Head) for it's accuracy for portraying working employees. We follow Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran, who's also in many of Kevin Smith's other movies) and his day at the convience store as a clerk working on his day off. And there's Randal Graves, his next door working buddy who constantly shows up next to Dante behind the couter and they both pursue the meaning of life and more. And of course right around the corner we have Jay and Silent Bob, a couple of known drug dealers who constantly show up here and there in this flick, but more limited than in other Kevin Smith movies (for those who love the two heroic icons).
Clerks is a simple, insanely low-budget comedy that focuses on something that we all look for in a movie: smart dialogue. The way that Kevin Smith writes the dialogue in between his characters are pure original and genious, and Clerks is no exception.
So if you are looking for a graphically enhanced and special-effects filled flick, turn away from Clerks as far as you can, but if you like a good movie with excellent dialogue (although filled with extreme profanity and humor), Clerks is an ideal choice. It's a slacker and funny comedy.",1030406400,,1765,4.624203821656051
654730,5,6303430570,"Clerks made a big splash when it first came out. And I can see why. Kevin Smith made a good movie on a tiny budget. It's an entertaining movie about nothing.
It has its faults. You can tell an inexperienced filmmaker made the film. The camera work and editing isn't up to the standards of a 'Hollywood' film, but it does have its charm. What really carries it is the snappy dialogue. Smith has written an excellent script, and his writing is what really carries the movie (that and a great performance by Jeff Anderson). And of course Jay and Silent Bob.
Smith also makes a great dvd. There is a commentary by Kevin Smith and members of the cast and crew. The commentary isn't as good as I've heard on other dvds. They talk about making the movie, but it's more like they just got together. Yeah, you get the feel of their comraderie, but not enough time on the movie (and Jason Mewes should have just not been allowed to be on the commentary track--I love his character, but he just laid around drunk on the commentary track, and when he spoke, it was disruptive). There are delted scenes and an alternate ending introduced by Kevin Smith. And the Soul Asylum music video that Smith directed.
It's a solid movie and a solid dvd. And an important film. Any film student or filmmaker should have it. And even if you aren't a film student, it is still a great movie.",1030233600,3,1364,4.416666666666667

I was about 16 when i first saw clerks, a recommendation by an older friend, in fact it was just before mallrats made its video debut here.
I was instantly hooked, here was a humour that didn't revolve around jim carrey looking stupid, and it was loud and crude without being dumb in the way a lot of vulgar comedies are (see austin powers).
Shot for peanuts it was nonetheless an excellent showcase for Kevin's unique writing ability, yes his movies are wordy, and so sometimes some scenes are pretentious but this is just an every day guy making every day movies and putting his friends in them (even today) and something about that was real and touching.
The acting by Brian O Halloran and Jeff Anderson in Clerks is excellent considering neither are professional actors, the dialogue and wit just flows and they play off each other with a chemistry many hollywood directors cant even get with $25 million a film actors - its realistic, like two witty friends in a series of endless conversations, quick firing and crude, which if we are realistic, most young people today are, i know i can barely get through a sentence without cursing ;)
it doesnt mean they don't have anything more intelligent to say, as is the excuse in a lot of movies, or for most peoples use of curse words, as Smith's wonderfull dialog shows, its just who they are, and it brings it more down to earth than a lot of these movies or tv shows that strive for realism yet nobody smokes, swears, or does anything really bad.
Anyway, the plot follows the day in the life of two convenience store clerks in a day that ever gets worse - theres the plot right there, thin yes, but also brilliantly simple and achingly funny.
Now, the main purpose of this review is to review the dvd itself, its not as good as the other DVD's by Smith, but it has very good features (including the original (and better) ending) and a directors commentary, that while probably being the worst of all commentaries by Smith Et Al, is still very funny and insightfull - watch out for Jason Mewes passed out for most of the track and just waking up every few minutes to mumble something into the mic.

654733,4,6303430570,"Clerks is the story of two foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed 20-something men, one of whom works in a convenience store and the other who works in the video store next door.  Since their jobs are mind-numbingly dull, they entertain each other with arguments about which Star Wars film is the best, the sexual exploits of their girlfriends, and complaining about their dim-witted customers (one of which checks every egg on the shelf, trying to find ""the perfect dozen,"" and another that asks for ""that movie that was out last year, you know, with that guy in it."")  The convenience store clerk, Dante, is also in midst of a relationship crisis with the return of an ex-girlfriend.  Rounding out the regulars (I hesitate to call them ""stars"") are Jay and Silent Bob, the drug dealers that hang out in front of the store.
This film is very funny - I laughed often.  However, the humour is quite crude (it originally got an NC-17 for the language alone!), and is therefore not for everyone.  However, people in my (and Kevin Smith's) generation will certainly recognise the kernal of truth in the characters - we've all known a drug dealer, had a foul-mouthed slacker friend, and worked in tedious jobs.  That's not to say the film is realistic, more of a parody of real life that is great fun at the same time.
Nothing much happens in the film, but the screenplay by director Kevin Smith (who also plays Silent Bob) is so much fun that nothing needs to happen.  It's great fun to watch the amateur actors put in better performances than a many of Hollywood stars, especially in the long takes (often 5+ minutes) that is a trademark of this film.  The quality of the filming is poor - it is grainy and barely focussed - and the sound isn't great either.  However, that's part of the charm (almost like watching through the stores' surveillance comeras), and this DVD edition makes no attempt to clean the material up.
This DVD has a few neat extras, like the original ending (basically, the same ending with 30 seconds more footage), a music video by Soul Asylum (that Smith directed and in which Jay lip-synchs and Silent Bob plays guitar), and some cut scenes.  The commentary is a little disappointing, although it does include some neat tidbits on casting, the identities of the actors (for example, Smith's mother is in the film), etc.",1029110400,3,2330,4.702702702702703

654735,5,6303430570,"Kevin Smith writes some of the best scripts in today's cinema world.  Sure, he can be crude and even a little too descriptive, but he can also be clever and insightful.  ""Clerks"" was his first attempt at movie making, and it created such a splash that he now has the money and ego of one of today's top director.
""Clerks,"" a black-and-white, not necessarily visually-pleasing film, tells the story of Dante (Brian O'Halloran), an unhappy convenience store clerk with relationship troubles.  His carefree video store worker pal Randal (Jeff Anderson) provides advice, good or bad, and comic relief to try and brighten Dante's day.  This movie was sort of a behind-the-scenes at the Quick Stop in addition to being a comedy about Dante's lovelife.  We get a look at annoying customers, being stuck at work on your day off, drug dealers making sales outside the store, and challenging authority.  These are all issues clerks deal with, although maybe not everyday.  After all, it's not everyday that an old man has a heart attack in the employee restroom.  But for comedic purposes, Smith crammed as much as he could into this sort of mockumentary, giving Dante and Randal plenty to deal with and keeping the plot going.
This movie is kind of an acquired taste.  A lot of people don't like the long dialogues between Randal and Dante, such as the one about independent contractors in the Death Star.  But I found them to be to funny.  Lots of people sit around and talk about nothing like these two guys do.  Therefore, those conversations are something audience members should relate to.  But to each his own.  Some viewers want more action in lieu of long, intelligent dialogue.
The DVD has some good stuff on it, including commentary by the director, cast and crew, and extended scenes.  One of the coolest features is the original ending.  I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.  For the record, I like the way the movie ended in the final cut better.

654736,3,6303430570,"Kevin Smith's films are distinguished by a comic sensibility that is at once eminently urbane and pathetically puerile, fueled by a worldview that overflows with offhanded insight and yet remains too quick to acknowledge this insight for its own benefit. Examining his debut feature seriously, what can we ascertain from a film about grocery-store clerks who endlessly pontificate on sex, ethics, politics, and the architectural intricacies of Lucas's Death Star? Judging from the dialogue, at least, we can immediately sense a talent desperate to be qualified as ""intelligent,"" in the strictest sense of the term, and though it would be grossly inconsiderate to dismiss Clerks as a ""stupid"" motion picture (it is indeed almost as canny and clever as it makes itself out to be), it's difficult to ignore a side of Smith's brainy, sesquipedalian screenplay that emerges slightly cloying alongside his unique brand of scatological humor. Nonetheless, we can still appreciate and enjoy Smith's pretensions for what they are, especially considering the fact that ""Clerks""' most dominant virtue is the sheer presence of its characters, lovingly worked out from the forge of the writer-director's experience with eccentricity.",1027900800,,1220,5.49468085106383

It's perfect. Dante is a whiny loser, and he's great as the central character. Randal is a cynical video clerk; hates his customers; even sells children cigarrettes.
This is the first movie to feature Jay and Silent Bob and they are quite different from their later appearances. They are much rougher than in MALLRATS, for example. In Mallrats, they are cartoonish characters, but in this one, they are loud (Well, Jay is) and drug dealers. They're drug dealers in all the movies, but this one features it at the most prominent.

The DVD is quite good. It has a great commentary (In which Jay sleeps through most of it), deleted scenes, and a music video. Sure, it's a direct port from the Laserdisc, but the laserdisc was a good one.

654820,5,6303430570,"Dante Hicks' oft-repeated lament sets the tone for probably the worst day in his life, something that we the viewer are privy to.
And who would ever have thought of filming in two convenience stores and making interactions with customers funny, not to mention the ordeals Dante has to go through to make it to closing?  The events themselves are creative juices of Kevin Smith.
A close second place is the dialogue, which is snappy, refreshing, profane, and laugh-until-your-lungs-ache funny.  In fact there are times when I read the screenplay just to get laughs and simply marvel at Kevin Smith's genius.  And nearly every line illuminated that light inside me.  Randal has the lion's share of them.  His conversation to the distribution center when placing an order is classic, especially as a young mother has asked for Happy Scrappy Hero Pup for her little one.  After he goes down his list, he asks the now bewildered mother, ""What was that title again?""  And his conversation with Dante about how much j-zz moppers make ending with his flashing a nude magazine to a customer is another gem.  The Star Wars conversation involving his difference between the two Death Stars in Star Wars and Jedi are actually philosophically sound while being entertaining.  His statement that people dictate their own behavior is pure, refreshing Enlightenment philosophy.
Examples of exceptional Randal lines:  ""This job would be great if it wasn't for the f-----g customers.""  ""I could do without the customers in the video store.""  Dante asks, ""Which ones?""  Randal replies, ""All of them.""
I can relate to those two pieces of dialogue.  At my workplace, I'm an introvert, not comfortable in talking to people or selling them something they don't need, but having no problem when fellow employees consult my expertise on a piece of product.  Also, I'm a Jedi Master when it comes to tasks and shipment.  Needless to say, my rhythm is comes to a jarring halt when some customer asks me for help.  The way I see it, if they need help, let them initiate contact first--the scars from rude customers are many and deep, and I don't want to reopen any of them, so I punish them by ignoring them, unless they want my help.  A variation of Dante's ""I don't bother them and they don't bother me.""
And third place goes to the choice of characters, convincing and never miscast.  Fourth goes to Silent Bob's pearl of wisdom to Dante.
Veronica, Dante's patient and caring girlfriend, has the right idea--education.  ""You have so much potential that's goint to waste in this place.""  You go, girl!  She's a better alternative to Caitlin, the ex-girlfriend who cheated on the same number of times as Fellini's best and best-known movie.  (Cinephiles will know what I'm talking about).
The cat has a good scene when he does his business in front of a clearly befuddled customer.  Dante then sniffs the air, after which an offscreen meow is heard.  And it's the cat who perks up after Dante interrogates Veronica ""how many..."" mirroring the anticipation we feel in wanting to know the answer.
Pairs seem to come into play as a motif-e.g. Dante and Randal, Dante and Veronica, Dante and Caitlin, Dante and customer, Randal and customer, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob.  And as for triangles, one is enough!
There's one continuity error that I'm sure most fans have already spotted, but is worth mentioning.  It's the timing factor involving the little girl who bought the cigarettes, the hockey game, the old guy dying in the store.  Dante claims that the hockey game ended at 3:30 and that they returned from the funeral at 4:00.  However, that is the time the city employee claimed the girl bought the cigarettes, which was actually earlier in the movie.  Also, it's dark by the time Dante and Randal return from the funeral, so it must have been six or seven at the latest.  To really confuse things, the coroner claims the old man died at 3:20, ten minutes before the game ended.  Well, the old man came in AFTER the game ended.
But does this deflect enjoyment from the movie?  No way, it serves as an interesting forum of discussion among cinephiles.  And the black and white reflecting the bleak lackluster life at a convenience store and Dante's miserable life is sheer genius.  Filming it in colour is cinematic blasphemy.",1026950400,,4307,4.813605442176871

There's no real plot--basically, it's a day in the life of a couple of clerks and the assorted oddballs who populate their lives--but ""Clerks"" has ten times the energy and originality of nearly every big-budget, small-minded Hollywood production in recent memory. This is due in large part to Smith's profane, irreverent dialogue, surefooted direction, and some convincing performances. Many memorable, laugh-out-loud moments; my favorites have to be the ""Star Wars"" discussion, and the ""sexual revelations"" bit. (It's a riot hearing people discuss ""Star Wars"" as seriously as some would debate Plato's ""Republic""). The low budget means this looks more like ""The Blair Witch Project"" than ""The Matrix,"" but big production values do not a great film make (see ""Pearl Harbor"" for a prime example).

with one of my former housemates! There are so many funny scenes
in this! I love that part where that Russian guy sings the song
BERSERKER and the scene where that Chewley's rep gets all the
customers riled up about smoking, the hockey scene on the roof-

off that customer in the video scene! The dialogue is perfect and
I like how JAY puts an exclamation point at the end of it! There
are many funny characters, but I would have to say that my favor-
ite is SNOWBALL. He just kind of wanders around in the movie,
showing up at various times and the deleted scene with him is
hilarious. I really enjoyed the DVD version of this, with all the

654894,5,6303430570,"Winner of Sundance's Filmmakers Trophy in 1994, Kevin Smith's Clerks has a certain humor about it that shines through the whole film. Shot entirely in black-and-white, the film revolves around the characters Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson). The film, although incredibly funny, deals with some serious emotional issues such as death, relationships, odd sexual fetishes, and hockey (the most serious of all emotional disorders). Yet, it is Kevin Smith's ability to make these heavy issues funny that makes this movie work.
Clerks is the first of the five movies in the New Jersey series (the others being Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). If you've enjoyed any of Kevin Smith's other movies, I really recommend seeing Clerks. It lays the basis for a few of the characters in the other films: Jay and Silent Bob, the men of the Hicks family (Brian O'Halloran plays a different Hicks in each movie), Rick Derris, Julie Dwyer, Heather Jones (sister of Tricia Jones in Mallrats), Caitlin Bree, and the cousin Walter that Randall and Brodie share.
Clerks really is a remarkable film, especially considering that it was shot from start to finish in one day. Sure it's raw, but that's part of its charm, and that's why it's so enjoyable. While Kevin Smith has made four movies since this one, I still keep coming back to watch Clerks more than any of the others.",1022025600,3,1408,4.920168067226891

You have deprived yourself of one of the best indie films of the 1990s, not to mention one of the better gut buster comedies ever!  ""Clerks"" is the first (major) project by Kevin Smith and it follows the lives of a few New Jersey based characters, but mainly Dante.  Dante is a clerk in a convenience store and he pretty much hates his miserable job, which is destroying him slowly.  His spicy little girlfriend encourages him to go back to school.  Randal, his outspoken best friend and a worker at the video store next door, tires to help out his bud but often helps to paint Dante into a corner.  Also, Randal's definition of friendship is wavy. You wouldn't think that a little quick-stop store would be much for an exciting adventure, but craziness does ensue as both Dante and Randal meet an annoying cast of customers (most notably Jay and Silent Bob) and somehow manage to squeeze a hockey game and a funeral into the day.  And I haven't even told you just some of the snide sarcastic jabs that keep getting thrown around.  Comedy is a defense mechanism and it works!

The great thing about Clerks is that it doesn't try for cheap laughs, yet just every movement and line is great comedy.  Of course, its not like ""Clerks"" is a drama, but its just that nearly everything about it gets you.  Yes, it's all in a rough black and white and the budget is nill, but the material is so strong that it doesn't matter!  ""Clerks"" is the rare gem of a comedy that, luckily, never got a real squeal.  There was the little seen yet entreating ""Clerks"" cartoon, but it really left you wanting more.  Of course, Kevin did continue to use the characters again (Jay and Silent Bob mostly), but never totally rehashed the Clerks story that much.  ""Clerks"", the movie is classically irreverent and real, not like most of the insufferable sight gag shtick that people are so attracted to.  The DVD has a hilarious audio commentary, a Soul Asylum video (ah, remember them!) and deleted scenes and s shocking alternate ending.  The audio commentary is funny and gives us a lot of insight as to how the movie was made, some of the people in it and give us a few laughs along the way.

This film, like other Kevin Smith films, is carried largely by the quality of the screenplay's dialogue and the quality of actors chosen for it.  While the acting in this film, being his first, independently produced, film, does not approach the level of Chasing Amy or Dogma, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran, it does not need to.  The comedy in the film manages to be new and entertaining despite its seemingly base, retread topics: drugs, sex, and of course, hockey and Star Wars.  Smith's mastery of comedic dialogue is evident in this film, his very first, and Anderson and O'Halloran are the perfect comedic duo to carry the material.  The film exhibits Smith's great potential both as a writer and a director.",1019606400,,785,4.87218045112782
655030,5,6303430570,"CLERKS is a film that a bunch of buddies and I watched repeatedly in college.  Even after having seen the film more times that I can count, there's still something there that can make me laugh.  If you haven't seen it, then you certainly should, as long as you aren't one to be easily offended.  However, a word of warning to the uninitiated: the movie originally received an NC-17 rating based purely on the raunchy dialog.
The characters in CLERKS are some of the most memorable and entertaining people that you'll ever see in a movie.  Becoming more familiar with the film after multiple viewings, it may surprise you when you realize exactly how small the roles are of some of the unforgettable inhabitants of Clerksworld.  Olaf the Berserker, Snowball, the various angry, irritable customers, and others don't really have all that much screen-time, but I'll wager that many people will be quoting their favorite lines and insults to their friends for weeks after seeing the film.
Of course, the main selling points of the film are the two lead characters, the eponymous Dante and Randall.  Relatively speaking, they both have the same job.  Dante works in a convenience store, Randall in a video store.  Because he lets his boss walk all over him, Dante always gets stuck with the worst shifts, and dealing with the worst customers.  He can't make up his mind over his love life or his future.  He has no idea what he wants to make of himself.  On the other hand, Randall delights in showing up late for work, temporarily closing the store any time he wants to hang out in the convenience store (which is practically the entire movie), and ""ripping into the occasional customer"".  He is in exactly the place he wants to be, as the low ambitions he sets for himself have been achieved.  The two characters play off of each other perfectly.  One is angry, but content to mutter and complain about the terrible hand of fate, while the other is satisfied by hanging out with his friend on company time and wasting as much of the work day as possible.
The commentary track on the DVD (originally recorded during a break in the filming of MALLRATS and meant for the Laserdisc edition of the film) offers quite a bit of insight in the script, the background, and the filming.  Unfortunately, the recording took place using only a single microphone that was passed around to the various people sitting in the room.  So while the DVD box claims that a lot of the cast and crew were involved, it is actually made up primarily of Kevin Smith with only cameos from the rest of the participants. Still, Smith does offer quite a bit of behind the scenes trivia, and after starting in a faintly overly-defensive mood, really loosens up and gives one the impression of someone who is still quite proud of his work, but isn't blind to all faults.
The most notable person on the commentary track without the initials K.S. is Jason Mewes, who spends the entirety in a drunken stupor, only waking up briefly to swear, to claim that he loves chicks, and to incorrectly quote his own lines from MALLRATS.  The primitive method of recording the commentary means that when other people in the room remark on parts of the movie, we can hear Smith responding to them, but we can't hear the original comment that inspired the reply.  It's a fairly frustrating listening experience, but ultimately one that is still rewarding.
The other DVD extras are well worth viewing as well.  There's a whole bunch of scenes that were cut from the final version of the film and there is also an alternative ending that, thankfully, Kevin Smith had the good sense to remove before releasing the film to theatres.  The Soul Asylum music video is entertaining enough, and lets you watch a short version of the CLERKS hockey game sequence in color and with the band members playing along.
Buy this DVD.  It's a whole lot of fun.  It's got comedy, romance, action, idiots, stoners, and geeks talking about science fiction.  It's also got Jay and Silent Bob, who are worth the price of admission just by themselves.",1019520000,10,4074,4.683029453015428

Unfortunately Clerks was the first and last good movie he has created (with the slight exception of the Clerks Cartoon which was average).
The story is about two young clerks, Dante and Randall, who are stuck in the mundane aspects of their lives and although they are obviously discontent they will not, or cannot escape this ""Waiting for Godot"" mentality.
The story is amusing the the conversations are (pseudo)inteltually amusing.
My only complaint about Clerks is how Kevin Smith changed the ending. I think the original ending was much better than the one that he finally chose for the theater. It simply was the ""perfect"" ending to a ""perfect"" day.

It is really unusal, for one thing it's in black and white which really added to the tone, it made it better.  Also it's funney, but for whatever reason I was not laughing.  I could kind of relate to some of these clerks mostly because they deal with ideot customers, I have been there and anyone who has held a job at Fastfood, Convienvce, or rentals knows this as well.

Number 1 was the fact that the entire film is shot in black and white. I realize the K. Smith was probably trying for an artistic deviation from todays movies but it made the film harder to watch. The lack of color gave me a headache and I was ready to turn it off midway through the flick. It'd be different if the film was shot on the true, old, black and white cameras. These had definition, shades, and hues that can't be replicated.
The cameras used in Clerks remind me of watching a cheap, fuzzy, security surveillance camera.
Number 2, except for the opening scenes, the director never takes the viewer outside of the mini-mart. I felt trapped in a convenient store, devoid of colors, for a long 90 minutes! I would've liked to see what was going on outside of the Quickiemart.
Number 3, there was no real plot, just a series of events. A day in the life of a clerk at a convenient store. Except for the man who passed away in the bathroom, this leads to a very boring motion picture.
This has to be my least favorite of Kevin Smith's films. Even Jay and Silent Bob, and their antics, couldn't save this flick. In my opinion, the director tried way too hard to make his film stand out amongst others.
If you're considering buying this movie, and you haven't seen it, I recommend that you rent it first!! It's hard to believe that this ...came from the mind of the director who wrote Dogma, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and SB Strike Back!",1015545600,2,1601,4.412162162162162

The grittiness of this little film would indeed have been murkier had I compared it to its glossier decendants.  Since it was a sketchy, low-budget-type movie, it would understandably be deemed ""unrefined"" in light of Smith's big-money movies like Dogma.
Being twenty-something, I found a lot of the humor was based on pop-culture I was in tune with (there's a a couple of funny dialogues about the Star Wars trilogy, for example). However, those who are averse to vulgar locker-room language should probably skip this one. There's plenty of talk about sex, porn and drugs. Those who aren't thus offended will find good one-liners and witty exchanges.  The acting, I'll admit, was somewhat cheesy.",1010620800,2,778,4.969230769230769

Instead, I was totally bored and had no trouble keeping myself from even a chuckle.  The dialog between the characters was not particularly interesting---just mainly vulgar which bores me to death.  My wife left the room after a half hour of it as she felt it was too offensive.  I think I turned it off after 45 minutes.

The dialog is really what kills this movie. The actors are pretty amateurish, and the delivery of lines is wooden and completely unnatural. The whole movie is based around conversations, and while the actual text of the script is good, the actors don't pull it off.
It's pretty easy to make me laugh. But, as this movie stands, it only evoked a few chuckles. Not worth the price tag.",1010102400,4,606,4.468468468468468
655143,4,6303430570,"...boy, ain't THAT the truth! Being a comic-book / Stars Wars geek , Kevin Smith's movies are pretty much required viewing for me and my ilk. Although I loved ""Chasing Amy"" the most, my past experiences as a till jockey (at a comic book & collectibles shop, no less!) makes ""Clerks"" the Smith-flick I identify with the most.
Thanks (or rather, NO thanks) to my misadventures in the retail trade, I can really relate to Dante & Randall as they spend their respective shifts dealing with rude, obnoxious, and just-plain-weird customers & hangers-on as well as their own boredom during lulls in the action. I especially enjoyed Randall's attitude of indifference & apathy, and his rude & smart-alecky behavior towards the video store patrons he rings up. There were times when I wanted to do the exact same things to the more unsavory regulars that'd pop up at the shop I worked at! Unfortunately, the boss was almost always present, so I had to watch myself or I'd be lectured about ""not alienating the big-spender customers with my attitude problem"" or some such nonsense.
But I digress. Being a fairly ardent Star Wars aficionado, I found Randall's attempt to put the builders of the Death Stars into a real-world perspective quite entertaining. Who knew there were independent contractors and labor unions in a galaxy far, far away? Then there's the rooftop street-hockey game, our heroes' all-too-brief paying of their respects to a dearly departed ex-girlfriend, one young woman's catatonic-state-inducing experience (a moment that will be referred to in ""Chasing Amy""), and a bunch of other stuff I can't really put into words `cuz it's pretty raw.

655144,4,6303430570,"This is the movie that you could say started it all. Definitely a good movie for Kevin Smith fans and just a fun movie to watch. Especially if you plan on watching the other films, which have interlacing themes/stories and references. Gives you a ""small town"" coincidental feeling.

It is filmed all in black and white, almost if it was seen through the security camera. It's a neat effect that plays well for the theme of the movie. The basic premise is that the two main characters are Clerks at a convenience store and the next door Video rental. The encounters with different patrons and of course the weed peddling Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious. The story as it unfolds is both smart and vulgar, and has several reoccurring themes that you can catch as you go through the story. There are a lot of fast exchanges of dialogue that you'll have to pay attention to, which all comes to a bunch of hard-hitting revelations and conclusions for most of the main-characters.
Kevin Smith enjoys displaying both the intelligent and vulgar/fart/genetalia joke sides in his films. Whether debating hardcore midget p0rn, the Star Wars movies, smoking, or delving into what every clerk has to go through on a daily basis, it'll be delivered in it's own style.

And if you enjoy Clerks:
Definitely recommend watching: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II.",1004313600,,1387,4.799163179916318

>
There isn't much of a plot to give away, really...young man with dead-end job juggles romantic crises, wiseassed friends, and ball hockey commitments around a (slightly les than typical) day behind the counter at his place of employment, a convenience store in New Jersey. If you are easily offended, you probably won't make it through the first 15-20 minutes of this movie... it's one of my favorite flicks of all time, but it definitely has its off-color moments.

The DVD presentation itself I'm less than satisfied with, though...the commentary is obviously dated (I lost track of how many ""we're in the process of making 'Mallrats'"" references there were...and that let-down of a follow-up was three movies ago) and could have been re-done for the sake of this ""Collector's Edition"" DVD release. At the time I bought this DVD, it was priced far more extravagantly than it is now, but I credit Kevin Smith for creating a movie that's so fantastic that it was able to set and maintain its own mark. If you have a DVD player and a VHS player, you may no longer find youself contemplating the VHS version simply for the sake of saving a few dollars.  All the same, the DVD transfer isn't really that much better (unless you just can't live without the 1.85:1 ratio and dig the extra features) than what I remember the VHS presentation to be...but I definitely recommend this movie to be purchased and watched as often as possible, regardless of the format chosen...it really is that good.",1003881600,,1775,4.7817589576547235
655221,5,6303430570,"Kevin Smith is quick to be pigeonholed as a writer of vulgarity and immaturity.  Underneath the language, however, he has always shined with his insightful ""askewed views"" of life and reality.
 CLERKS, Smith's debut effort, was a realistic (sometimes not) look at what can happen in the daily routines of a convenience store employee.  Rather than rely on special effects or dramatic plots, CLERKS delivers pure meaning without all the fizz and sugary icing.  Unfortunately he spent too much money on MALLRATS, the next movie which didn't have nearly the charisma of this one.
Who can forget an anti-smoking advocate accusing a clerk of ""just following orders""?  Would you ever imagine going into a movie store to request a film, only to have the names of pornos recited in your face?  Have you ever had the desire to play hockey (or any other field sport) on the roof of a building?  Are you the type that wishes you could attack your customers?  A ""yes"" answer to any of the above means you should see this movie.
It's profane and not for little kids, but for intellectual teenagers and liberal-minded adults, CLERKS is a gem you won't forget soon.  Kevin Smith is the Misfits of movies!!!",1003795200,2,1191,4.770731707317073
655222,4,6303430570,"(Insert all general, well-deserved, and standard superlatives about Kevin Smith and ""Clerks"" here).
As for the DVD itself, a hallmark of ANY DVD with Kevin's name on it is the excellent value for your money -- you get not only the movie, but many concominant ""bonus features"" that are fantastic enough to warrant purchasing the DVD on their presence alone.
Another guaranteed feature of any Kevin Smith DVD is the ""commentary"" section (although there's one minor criticism I have on this point).  Kevin, who invariably has many people connected to the movie (on-screen and off), leads a VERY funny running commentary (this applies not only to ""Clerks,"" but any DVD).  Side stories, heads-up pointers, and general analysis are all peppered with funny and insightful thoughts.  One feels almost as if you were watching a favorite movie with a bunch of friends who are making an effort to ensure that you're in on the joke.
(Minor criticism time:  One (unfortunate) side effect of a KS doing DVD commentary is his habit of naming what seems like each and every actor who appears on screen, no matter how minor.  It can have the effect (and at times did have the effect on the Clerks DVD) of making it feel like you were watching a home movie.  I don't care that the guy who watched Lenin's Tomb take a sandbox break owned the theater where auditions were held, nor that his wife played opposite Jeff Anderson's famous ""I don't appreciate your ruse"" scene.  Still, it's a VERY minor point in the whole big scheme of things, although I note that Kev's still doing it even as recent as the Clerks: Animated Series DVDs (those are even funnier than the ""Clerks"" DVD, by the way)).

655224,5,6303430570,"Clerks was made on a low budget and it shows, but it's still much more enjoyable, witty, smart, and hilarious than numerous movies on a big budget. The movie follows a day in the lives of two ""clerks"", one in a convience store (Dante) and one in the ""crappy video store"" (Randall). The story centers around Dante's troubled love life: he's has a girlfriend he loves (Veronica), but he longs for an ex-girlfriend (Caitlin) who cheated on him numerous times. Dante finds out his ex is engaged and tries desperately to find out if it's true and why he wasn't informed before hand. In the midst of this, Randall and Dante discuss Star Wars, make clever observations on life and the world around them, go to a wake that ends with Dante and Randall being chased out of the funeral home by a mob of angry guests, play hockey on the convience store roof, and put up with some clueless and annoying customers (""You expect me to drink this coffee hot?"").
The dialog from writer/director Kevin Smith carries the movie as there is little action, but it works. You get a sense that the characters are real people as opposed to many movies in which the characters are empty and emotionless. Dante and Randall are smart and witty, and you get the sense that they have some kind of great talent that they don't know what to do with. Dante is especially unsure of what he wants to do with his life, and it takes Randall to point him towards the source of his problems. Anyone who has worked retail (including me) can relate to some of the annoying customers and how at times the job can become mind-numbingly and painfully boring.
I will not spoil the most notable scene for those that haven't seen the film. It happens off screen, but will still leave you with a look of shock when you find out what happened. Clerks is not for those who are easily offended by strong language or those uncomfortable with talk about sex (including ""snowballing"" and deadly means of self-gratification). But the movie works without resorting to crude, sickening humor. And of course, the infamous Jay and Silent Bob make their debut.

1.  Smith originally wanted to play Randall, but decided that he couldn't be a major character and direct the film without going nuts.  Instead, he became Silent Bob.  The world hasn't been the same since.
2.  The idea for Mallrats came out of a guy at Sundance wanting to re-shoot Clerks as an A-movie, with color.  That's one big reason that Mallrats is just as much a ""buddy movie"" as Clerks is.
3.  The scenes with Randall randomly driving through town are completely incorrect--they're going nowhere near the funeral home they end up defacing later on in the movie.

I work overnight at a truck stop in Pennsylvania, and my co-workers and I have quoted lines from this movie several times a day; most notably ""This job would be great if it wasn't for the _______ customers"". This is not a big money Hollywood flick. This is an independant, black and white movie, and the first of what would later be refered to as ""The Jersey Trilogy"" (Clerks, Mallrats & Chasing Amy).

""Clerks"" is a departure from the mainstream Hollywood hoo-ha, not sporting any big-name actors, high production values, and superficial characters.  Heck, this movie cost about $27,000 to make and was filmed in the same Quik Stop that Smith was working in at the time, taking advantage of meal breaks and off-hours to film the movie.  The film was edited in the nextdoor video store where the character Randal was employed in the movie.  So don't expect breathtaking cinematography, flashy special effects, or revolutionary surround-sound technology.  The ""plot"", so to say, is a day in the life of a convenience store clerk, Dante, who has been called in to work on his day off.  It portrays how dealing with picky and sometimes downright rude customers can drive even the simplest person to the brink of insanity.  If you work as a cashier at a convenience or grocery store, like me, this film lets you know that you're not alone.  The antics the customers pull off are hilarious, ranging from the man trying to find the ""perfect dozen of eggs"" by emptying all the egg cartons, the elderly man who takes an adult magazine into the bathroom, only to die while looking at it, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob, who tape comic book-style voice bubbles containing pleas for homosexual sex favors to the entrance door so that when Randal opens the door, it appears he's actually saying it.  Jay (played by Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith himself) have appeared in all of Smith's films, proving to be possibly the funniest on-screen duo ever.  While this film is non-stop, rolling on the floor, teary-eyed comedy, it also has a very strong yet often overlooked moral that I got from it: Make the most out of every day, and if your life is in a rut, don't let it stay that way.  Now I'm not going to say that was the point Smith was trying to get across, because I have no place to dictate his artistic vision.  It's just what I got from the film.  The humor in this movie is all pretty much what you would call high school locker room humor, but the way in which it is presented (the black and white film makes it seem much more human), makes it impossible not to laugh.  So, all in all, ""Clerks"" is an extremely funny movie that proves as a nice abandon from the recent string of superficial pre-pubescent bubble-gum flicks and over-the-top ""Die Hard"" clones.

655325,5,6303430570,"The story of the making of Clerks is outstanding. It is amazing that the young filmaker Kevin Smith would risk making a movie that no one might see, and be drowned in credit card bills for years. ""Clerks"" cost under thirty thousand dollars, which would be peanuts to any film production company. Smith was in the habbit of collecting credit cards, so he charged all of the expenses to those. He hired some actors and used lots of his friends in the making of the movie. The Quik Stop that was used in ""Clerks"" was actually the place that he worked at. The film is really based off his experience as a worker there.
""Clerks"" is the story of a full day in the job of a store clerk. Dante Hicks(Brian O'Halloran) is called into work on an off day, and because he always gives in, he agrees to come in on the basis that he will be able to leave by twelve. Right when he gets to work, his problems begin. First off, the shades for the windows will not open because some punks jammed the locks with gum. He therefore has to remind customers that the store is now open, with the sign: I ASSURE YOU WE ARE OPEN.
He is then harassed by such customers as a cigarette hater, who rallies the cigarette buying customers against the seller of the cancer sticks. Randal(Jeff Anderson), who works next store in the video shop, spends more time doing his own thing instead of working. He also hangs out with Dante and takes pride in heckling the customers that make him tick, and there are many.
The customers that come into the Quick Stop are extremely wierd. One guy is obsessed with finding the perfect dozen of eggs, and on top of that, there are the milkmaids, the girl who obviously can't read, and a strange old man who is interested in adult magazines.
There is really no plot, but just an unusual day in the life of a store clerk. Dante is a college dropout, and his girlfriend tries to push him back into school. He really likes her, but he has trouble with the type of things that she has done with past boyfriends. He has gotten the news that his old girlfiend is getting married, and he becomes jealous.
Jay and Silent Bob: Possibly the funniest duo in a comedy. The pair are drug dealers, but they have trouble selling their product. Jay shoots his mouth off, steals, and marks his spot right in front of the Quick Stop. Silent Bob is just about the exact opposite. It is true that he marks his spot in front of the Quick Stop with Jay, but he does not speak. This may be to give what he finally does say some sort of insightment. The pair are played by Jason Mewes and the director himself; Kevin Smith. Kevin originally was going to play the part of Randal, but he didn't want to juggle director duty and play a part with so many lines, so he opted to play the non speaking role. Jay and Silent Bob are the funniest part of the movie, mainly because of the way that they are suited for each other. Jay calls Silent Bob his heterosexual lifemate.
""Clerks"" was originally NC-17 not for nudity or violence, but for the language which describes various sexual situations in great detail. It grossed 3 million in theaters for Miramax and they had bought it for 227,000 dollars. Therefore, it was a giant success. ""Clerks"" is not about achieving a certain visual style as it is with many films, but about the conversations and relationships between the characters. The production of ""Clerks"" and the film itself should serve as a standard to other independent filmakers who are out there trying to make it in an already overcrowded business.",994377600,5,3534,4.438461538461539

I think that's the point.  You have to want to know more about the artists and the craft than just watch a parade of light and shadow on a screen.  You want to know how and why this picture was made.  ""Clerks"" is a perfect movie for this purpose.
The commentary track is made during the filming of Mallrats, where none of the cast or crew really know how the second of the five ""Jersey"" films would gross or play to the audience.  Its a time of innocence and excitement for Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier and the View Askew crew as they talk up their great, groundbreaking film.  There is none of the resentment or bad ju-ju you can hear in the ""Mallrats"" or ""Chasing Amy"" commentaries about how the critics were overly harsh with it.  There is just joy in the idea that ""Clerks"" did so well and that, though changes were made, it was all for the best.  Only with DVD can you go back and hear Smith and Mosier ""back in the day"" like this and compare it to today.  Their honesty and frankness make the track work.
In addition, it is great to be able to see the lost scenes of Clerks, even if you agree they don't really add to the film.  They are extra bits of coolness to enjoy while waiting for ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" to hit theaters for new material.  The video for ""Can't Even Tell"" is the first time, I believe, you get to see the Clerks crew in color as well...a little bit of Askew history there, too.

The movie is in black and white which disappointed me at first, but you'll later learn that its really not a big deal.
The setting rarely goes past the convient/video store in which our clerks work. Seems odd yes, but fits with the story well.

655409,4,6303430570,"I wish I could give this film four and a half stars because it almost deserves five.  Some people will argue that this picture has no point and is light on story.  I totally disagree.  The message of this film is simple: if you are dissatisfied with your situation in life, stop complaining and do something to improve things.  The main character, Dante, is incapable of changing his life for the better.  Although he is sick of working at a convenient store and making nothing of himself, he has a tremendous fear of change.  Randall, who is seemingly afraid of nothing and operates the video store across the street, lacks the desire to do something more important with his life.  Both characters are smart malcontents who are obviously not getting nearly enough out of their potential.  Randall's poor treatment of the video store customers may irritate some of the film's viewers, but as a former video store employee who knows how stupid those types of customers can be, I found his behavior hilarious and I could certainly relate to it.  In a way, Randall is the person everyone would like to be -- rude, obnoxious, unafraid to piss stupid people off, outspoken, and irresponsible.  Dante, however, represents the type of person most of us are -- compromising, reluctant to take big steps in life, scared of confrontation, and dissatisfied with life.  Clerks is one day in the life of two kids in their early twenties and the bizarre events that happen around them.  The dialogue is great and the fact that the acting is not always great seems to actually help the movie in some strange way.  The black and white in which the film is shot is probably indicative of the dull lives these young clerks live, although there is nothing dull about this day.  Without a doubt, Kevin Smith's best film.  The cathartic speech Randall delivers to Dante at the end of the film makes for the perfect ending and adds a level of depth to the picture.  Though the awful language employed by the characters will not be enjoyed by many older viewers, Gen-Xers can certainly relate to the unique jargon used by those in the picture.

The trials and tribulations of some of the most inconspicuous drone workers of our times ('some' being clerks everywhere) are thoughtfully and hilariously revealed as more than just a worker, but a WORKING CLASS HERO!  Smith also has a amazing knack of rediculling society in all it's obvious folly. He proved this also in 'Dogma' by poking fun at, OH NO, HEAVENS, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, and before that 'CLERKS'. Smith is a pop culture treasure and 'CLERKS' years after its modest release proves to audiences today just how good Smith is.

I just this last week reviewed it for the first time since it came out, and I am delighted to be able to report that it was even funnier than I remembered it.
Now, this movie isn't for everyone.  I learned a long time ago that an awful lot of people don't like black and white films.  And a lot of folks don't like low budget films.  If either applies to you, just hold out for the next Hollywood blockbuster.
For the rest of us, who love and appreciate Independent film, this is just a great flick.  There are a lot of really hysterical characters, funny incidents, and, most of all, awesome dialog.  In fact, the only thing that really happens in this film is people talk a lot.  Luckily, it is GREAT talk.

Dante (O'Halloran) is the guy whose life just can't go right.  He is stuck in a low-paying no respect job that he hates.  He is forced to deal with idiots from the time he comes in until the time the store closes, on his scheduled day off no less.
The characters in this movie deal with more stuff in one day than most people will in their life.  A hockey game on the roof of the store, a funeral, and Dante's ex-girlfriend has sex in the bathroom with a corpse.
It is well-known that the movie was made on a shoestring budget, but it is great anyway.  The black and white is an added bonus.  I bought the video for $2.99 when a local rental store when it went out of business a few years ago.  My brother made fun of me then, but then last year he paid over $30 for the DVD.

655417,5,6303430570,"There is no denying it: ""Clerks"" is one of the funniest movies ever made, from the tiny snicker that escapes everyone's throat when Dante falls out of his closet to answer the phone to its very satisfying ending. It is almost nonstop funny, even when it decides to take little pitstops for moments of philosophy. It is very well acted, with more memorable quotes than a Shakespeare play, and it marks the beginning of one of the best and funniest comic directors ever to march onto a film set. Kevin Smith is a comic genius, sharply drawing all of his characters and giving each of them just the right edge for the actors to play on. Each character is an interesting individual, they aren't just play-offs of each other. Dante and Randal could've just been like any ordinary Abbott and Costello clones, and Jay and Silent Bob could've been exact duplicates of Cheech and Chong, but that would've been taking the easy/cliched way out. Smith is much smarter than that, and it shows in his hilarious and, at times, brilliant dialogue.
The plot of the film is fairly easy to explain. Dante and Randal are employees of the Quick Stop Convenience Store and RST Video Store. Dante gets called in on his day off because one of his co-workers falls ill, and because of Dante's hockey game at 2, the boss promises to be in the store to take over at noon. Dante accepts the deal and goes into work only to find gum jammed in the locks (""Buncha savages in this town"") to the steel shutters, the Asbury Press didn't arrive that morning, and in order to not lose business, he uses shoe polish to make a sign that he masking tapes to the side of the store that proudly proclaims, ""I ASSURE YOU WE'RE OPEN!"" That's just the first fifteen minutes of his day. Randal shows up late after an unruly costumer talks a mob into throwing cigarettes at Dante, and one costumer attempts to belittle Dante's existence but forgets something rather important to him (""No time for love, Dr. Jones""). This is a quite a start for a day off, but it only becomes more complicated when we find out about Dante having a girlfriend named Veronica who was a lot more busy in high school than he thought (""THIRTY-SEVEN!""), and he still carries a torch for the girl he dated for five years who cheated on him 8 1/2 times and is allegedly engaged to an Asian design major. WOW! Then we have the brief interludes of a pornoholic old man, a short-lived hockey game, and a funeral for ""one of the illustrious twelve"" women Dante has been with. All of this goes on while Jay and Silent Bob are dealing drugs and singing Russian metal songs, and ""Clerks"" never gets confused, it never steps off the point, and it never stops being funny. This is a monumental achievement for a director to make such extraordinary entertainment on his first try. As an aspiring filmmaker and video store clerk, myself, my hat is off to Kevin Smith, and I can't wait for the lightsaber fight between Jay, Silent Bob, and Mark Hamill. But until then, we have four great movies from this director who snuck in under the radar six years ago and delivered one of the truly great comedy films of all time.",984355200,3,3135,4.52112676056338

The movie, set up almost as a series of vignettes, plots through a somewhat unusual day in Retail Hell.  The film is definitely a first, independent effort, set up  to showcase talent to the Money.  But it definitely has that DIY sensibility, as well as Smith's consistent and dead-on view of people making their way in the world, and making their foolish mistakes.

655515,5,6303430570,"Because of budget restraints, ""Clerks"" is filmed in grainy black-and-white.  Fortuitously, the audience feels like they're eavesdropping on the action through the convenience store's closed-circuit camera.  And what are we privy to?  An over-the-top, crude, rude, and bitingly funny look at the nihilistic existence of a cynical, twenty-something, cash register jockey.  Kevin Smith is a masterful screenwriter (not so much as a director).  He has a flair for dialogue almost unparalleled in contemporary cinema.  Only Tarantino can match his wealth of pop-culture references and his characters' philosophical, id-obsessed personalities.
Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is woken from a disheveled slumber, and reluctantly summoned to cover a shift at his job down at the Quick Stop, a.k.a. Purgatory (by the way, the title card references to Dante Alighieri's ""Inferno"" give the film a hilarious air of pretentiousness, which perfectly meshes with the personalities of the characters).  He is the sane centre of the film, providing much of the film's humour with his incredulous reactions to the customers who come into his store.  Add to that his nihilistic mantra (""I'm not even supposed to be here today"") and what you get is the epitome of the indie-cinema put-upon anti-hero.  O'Halloran, who I believe is more a friend of director Smith's than a real actor, does well showing Dante's slow-burning mania.  Dante's main source of anguish is Video Store clerk Randal (Jeff Anderson), anarchist, hyper-cynic, s**t-disturber, and self-professed best friend.  Anderson, also an obviously amateur actor, delivers Randal's warped logic adequately enough.  His shining moment comes when he places a phone order for a series of ridiculously titled porno movies in front of a mother and her young child.
In hindsight, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) are the stars of Kevin Smith's movies.  Here, their first outing, they do little more than brighten up the background.  Although, all the staples of their later appearances are here: Jay's hyperactive motor mouth; the obsession with pot and women; Silent Bob's Zen-Buddhist aura and his one moment of vocal clarity.  You wish they had more screen time here, but are consoled in the knowledge that they dominate the later Smith movies.  Luckily, this film is full of Smith's sense of black humour and entertaining obsessions.  And if you can get past the fact that most of the acting is stiff and that the convenience store windows are dark in what should be the middle of the day (Smith was forced to film at night), you'll find ""Clerks"" an addictive, low-rent treasure.",980726400,11,2631,5.270983213429257

There is no plot per se, but essentially the movie centers around Dante, the convenience store clerk who has no direction in life and dreams about dumping his girlfriend Veronica, who is combative but loyal and caring, for his ex-girlfriend Caitlin, who cheated on him repeatedly when they were dating.  His buddy Randall, who works (sort of) at the nearby video store is the ultimate cool guy whose zen like observations about Dante's life are so on the mark.  Clerks is filled with funny and vulgar exchanges that I cannot repeat here, ... .  Also memorable is Silent Bob, played by the film maker Kevin Smith, who speaks only once but has the most profound line in the entire movie.

My favorite scenes:  1) the chewing gum salesman trying to turn kids off of cigarette smoking,  2) the man who wants to use the rest room,  3) Randall ordering porno flicks over the phone in the presence of a young lady and her daughter, and 4) Dante and Veronica talking about how many people they have been with and their argument that ensues from it.

To me, some of the greatest things in the movie are the little errors were people might trip on a word for a second. That's so real, that it give the movie a sense of reality that is missing in so many other movies. People have complained that Randall sounds like he's reading from cue cards. So what! Haven't you ever met anyone like that? I have.
Jay and Silent Bob are the kings of loitering. What class they possess. Dante and Randall are a shining example of what can happen to you after working too long in a convience and rental store, respectively.
There is nothing far fetched about the story of a guy having a bad day at work. I had many days almost that bad when I did retail. The dialogue is brilliant. Nice little insights about life and your place in it.

Pity me I did let a person talk me into watching the sequel Mall Rats, but once again the story failed, due to the fact that the only real thing that the two films have in common is the return of some of the original cast members.

655691,4,6303430570,"Hmm... I could have very easily given this film a five star rating but I didn't.... why?  Well before we go into the negatives, lets dwell on the  positives.
First of all, this is an excellent film.  Fast, witty  dialogue, great back to back scenes, boardering on the surreal without ever  escaping into the ridiculous.  Kevin Smith manages to write a script which,  despite all improbability, manages to create plausability.  And some of the  debates, such as the one about whether the construction workers making the  death star in The Return of the Jedi were actually innocent bystanders, and  hence whether the victory for the rebel alliance was marred are hilarious.  Not only for how seriously these characters take the ideas within these  films, but also for where their logic leads them. A script like this just  doesn't come along all that often and that is the core reason for watching  this great movie.
Filmed predominantly at night after hours in an actual  store, this film is also an icon to all low budget wannabe film directors.  Made on the proverbial shoestring budget it is another great demonstration  that it is not necessary for there to be huge special effect budgets in  order to create a great film.
However, it is not without its faults,  particularly the quality of acting.  Smith has brought in friends to play  the main characters, as one would expect from a fledgling production, and  it shows.  Jay is particularly bad and although some would say that this  adds to the naivety of the film, that it's seediness in places is what  makes it so good, I would have to marginally disagree (although I see  exactly where people are coming from on this one).
On top of this,  although the scenes are great individual sketches, you get the feeling that  the film is a compilation of the best stuff that Smith had written and just  all jammed on to one video.  This was supported by the low quality of the  sequal Mallrats.  There is no overriding emotional plot, no great theme,  apart from the girlfriend trouble idea which, frankly, does not involve the  viewer.  I did not care about the protagonists problems although I  definitely had a ton of fun watching him suffer and all the difficulties  that came with it.",965433600,4,2241,4.724675324675324

And just as Star Wars was the best of the ""Holy Trilogy"", this was the best of the ""(Un)Holy Trilogy"". Great flick, but my only complaint is the price.  I can kind of see the justification for it due to the added content, but it still seems a rather hefty premium for only a so-so translation from VHS.

Well, I wouldn't say it's one of the best but it's pretty good.  First, hats off to Kevin Smith for the unique  perspective of a movie about clerks.  Also, a hats off to the actors  because I don't know if regular actors can do something like this.  These  actors are a lot more believable than say if you get big name actors to  play the characters parts.  Last, hats off for making an entertaining movie  without the big budget.
That's where ""Clerks"" is a winner.  It's not big-budgeted, you get non major names to play roles.  The acting  is not top notch but they look as if they do fit those parts.  The more  believable these actors are to their characters, the more humorous the  movie was for me.
As for quality video and audio, this was a low budget  movie, so I wasn't going to expect any major video/audio at all.  As for  the special features, the audio commentary was funny but terrible in a way  that you can't really hear the actors speak.  It's like one microphone was  being used. This was a big minus for the DVD.  Why put it in there if you  can't hear it that well.  The alternate ending was a shock and it's very  good they didn't include it in the final release.  It would of made the  movie very depressing.  The Soul Asylum music video rocked and how it stays  with the ""Clerks"" theme made watching the music video that much  more enjoyable.  If there was anything very negative about this DVD, it's  that this DVD continues to be one of the most expensive ones out there.  Otherwise, thank God for DVD coupons.

655804,5,6303430570,"Financed largely by credit cards and money borrowed on good will from his family and close friends, ""Clerks"" was a surprise hit for independent filmmaker Kevin Smith in 1994, winning the Young Cinema Award at the Sundance Film Festival and later that year a Filmmakers Trophy at Cannes.  It would eventually spawn an animated series that only aired two episodes (a DVD that was released included all six episodes that were made, along with several special features for the most devoted fans).  On a budget barely tipping the scale at $27,000, the film grossed $3.1 million in the states and Smith created a cult classic, earning a devoted fan base that would analyze, collect and quote his films for years to come.

The story is based loosely on Smith himself, the movie filmed at QuickStop Groceries in Red Bank, NJ (the same convenience store at which he was employed at the time).  Because he was only allowed to film outside of business hours, the plot included a ""shoe polish"" scenario (which manufactured a brilliant recurring joke throughout the film) to explain the perpetually closed shutters.

Smith's alter ego is Dante Hicks (O'Halloran), a store clerk for QuickStop Groceries who gets called in on his day off after the employee assigned to the shift phones in sick.  He proceeds to spend the entire day kvetching with his friend Randall (Anderson), the clerk of a video store adjoined to QuickStop, pining over ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Spoonhauer) while placating his current squeeze Veronica (Ghigliotti).  In between monologues on Star Wars, sex and various other wild and random topics, Randall and Dante attend - and sabotage - a funeral, play hockey on the roof, watch hermaphroditic porn and discover a dead guy in their employee bathroom.  As his day transforms from bad to worse, Dante continuously and contemptuously yells, ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!""

The script is the film's strongest point - it's obvious that a lot of Smith's cast is pretty green and he cut corners by placing his actors in multiple roles as the many quirky personalities that happen upon the QuickStop throughout the day.  O'Halloran is the least stiff, making Dante a mewling but memorable character.  Anderson is meager but nevertheless entertaining as Randall - most of the time he sounds as if he's reading off of cue cards.  Spoonhauer and Ghigliotti are fair, whilst Mewes probably improvised most of his dialogue (not to mention being incredibly shy; the guy has the most loud and obnoxious role and he got really nervous when he and Smith had to dance).  Smith plays a part as well as Silent Bob to Mewes's Jay, two miscreants who hang out in front of the QuickStop from dawn to dusk and smoke pot, sell pot, yell salacious comments towards women, dance to a boombox and generally amuse themselves by harassing not only customers but also Randall and Dante themselves (by the way, it's Jay that does most of this - Silent Bob says little and dances well).

The Miramax Collector's Series DVD has some fairly good bonus material, including deleted scenes (with introductions by Kevin Smith) and an alternate ending that will have people either raising an eyebrow, dropping their jaw or just laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all.  Also included is a music video by Soul Asylum that has lead singer Dave Pirner making a cameo but Jay and Silent Bob pantomiming the song (this song plays during the end credits).  Audio commentary from Kevin Smith and cast/crew and a theatrical trailer round out the rest.

If you're looking to start a Kevin Smith anthology of your own, ""Clerks"" is a good start.  Your next best bet is his magnum opus thus far: ""Chasing Amy"" (and buy the Criterion Collection DVD - the bonus material is well worth the price for Smith fans).",957916800,,3785,4.850931677018633

Filmed in B&W due to budget limitations, this helps the movie to conjur up an depressive atmosphere for the movies main participants Dante (O'Hallaran) and Randall (Anderson).

The DVD has some fine additions aswell, including deleted  scenes and the alternate ending.  A bonus is the commentary given by Smith  and some crew members that can be added over the move - at times it moves a  bit too slow and can be a bit monotonous but it's in there and some nice  information can be gained from taking the time to watch it.",946944000,,789,4.6521739130434785

The characters seem alive and the set ups are hilarious.  It is a film so filled with quotable lines that it needs to be watched  weekly, in order to remind yourself of the ones you've forgotten.

I knew beforehand that it was  black-and-white and that Kevin Smith sold his comic book collection to get  the film made. Knowing that, I was already impressed. Though not as  outright slapstick humor-like as ""Mallrats"", ""Clerks""  is amusing...in that sickening sort of way. It is twenty-something  independent film at its best...complete with actors who are not in the  least ""quintessential Hollywood"" (and never will be).

It isn't a pretty picture, this movie is gritty and challenging, at times.  I couldn't stand  it the first time I watched it.  It is difficult to choose whether to like  or hate Dante, the main character.  The same can be said of his anti-social  compatriots, as well as the vast majority of the characters, though some  are easier to hate than others.

I was also jolted  by the consistently bad direction, and trite dialog.
I do admire the fact  that the film was made by a guy with a dream, and I am pleased that Kevin  Smith is becoming a mainstream hollywood type.  He certainly deserves it  more than 90% of the Joel Schumackers of the world, and as a student film,  my expectations would have been met, but after reading all the reviews here  and elswhere, I was really shocked at how bad this film turned out.",943747200,11,800,4.246666666666667

Yes, you can  really only appreciate it if you've worked retail before, otherwise the  jokes will most likely fly over your head.

This one is very dear to my  heart, for it captures the exact feel of the young working class. Yes, of  course, the dialogue is contrived. Yes, the acting is amateur night.
