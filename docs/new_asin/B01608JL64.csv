7454781,1,B01608JL64,You have to wonder at people who do a sequel to a successful movie that is a total flop the license it on Amazon as buy only and overpriced at that. Hell I'm not sure I would download a torrent for free much less rent this if the option was available.,1451260800,,251,3.9411764705882355
7454782,1,B01608JL64,LOVED the first one..This movie was just awful and so stupid,1451260800,3,60,4.545454545454546
7454783,3,B01608JL64,"The first SINISTER was SO scary, I think it would be almost impossible to put together a sequel that was equally terrifying. This movie, SINISTER 2 wasn't a bad movie at all, but with what came before it, it was almost certainly doomed to be much less satisfying and it was.
It still had that creepy music, which I thought added so much to the first film, but it just didn't deliver the chills and scares that the first one did. With that said, it was still an okay horror movie on it's own, if the first Sinister hadn't existed. The actors were good, the score was great and the storyline was fairly creative, considering where the movie needed to be started and that would be after the writer, Ellison Oswalt and his family were killed by the daughter, which personally I thought was a brilliant and disturbing way to end the first film. I liked that the part of ""Deputy So-and-So"" was back, but for me, I just couldn't help comparing the 2 movies and unfortunately, I think that that was ultimately what made me feel it was merely an okay movie and not a great movie. Sometimes, movies don't always need sequels, no matter how much money the first one made at the box office.and in this case, I wish that they had just left SINISTER, to stand alone because it was so great!",1451174400,,1276,4.411016949152542
7454784,4,B01608JL64,"This is a challenging review to write because its difficult to evaluate on its own merits. All sequels suffer from that. Sinister was one of the most effective horror movies of its decade and that makes it even harder. One of the best things about Sinister is its creation. It breaks new ground with its iconic boogey man. Once that cat is out of the bag, as with any sequel, at least half of the suspense and the intrigue is defeated because we already know the monster. Nonetheless, Sinister 2 is a good movie on its own. It has big shoes to fill though, so of course there are going to be criticisms. I'm not going to say mine because its really irrelevant. Everyone will have their own. The film is well acted, the movies continue to be grotesque. The addition of the spirit children was an interesting touch, with both strengths and weaknesses. I am not a fan of horror films with kid protagonists. They tend not to do it for me. So having so many kids around was not my cup of tea in general. Still, the apparitions got more ghoulish and clearer antagonists so better for me. They were sinister from the beginning but not as much as they got. The splitting of the 2 brothers was a also a good call. It made it more interesting, believable, and kept it away from PG 13 territory. I liked how the youngest kid, at the climax, would just not quit. Man, he was determined. Anyhow, there was tension, atmosphere, and visual imagery appropriate for horror. I love the aesthetics of Sinister's Bagul, and I liked how the story itself referenced aesthetics. The acting was solid, creating believable characters. I liked the insertion of a sacrificial despicable lamb. I was hoping he'd at least get his. Overall, I'm glad this film got made and I'm glad I bought it. I know it will get a lot of flack, as sequels are great targets for haters to begin with. Add to that a sequel of such a great film as Sinister. It won't stand much of a chance. Its a worthy horror film and I am not sorry I bought it. I will definitely watch it again. Any horror junkie worth his or her salt will watch it regardless of any review. I hope you can appreciate it as much as I did. 4.5 for I really like it. Bagul is a sequel worthy creation if I ever saw one, and even if nothing matches the original and they never do, I'm glad he got resurrected and at the caliber it did.",1450915200,13,2354,4.328054298642534

7454804,2,B01608JL64,"As a followup to the movie ""Sinister,"" this sequel is lacking severely. It almost seems like the story came from completely different writers. The movie took the same basic principles of children, Super 8 snuff films, and a Pagan deity. The movie explains nothing further than the first movie, other than burning the homes protects other people from falling into the same trap, and the overall plot seems inconsistent with its predecessor. In the first movie, Bughuul makes Ashley kill her family, allegedly by means of possession, in order to taint her innocence and devour her soul. However, Zach in Sinister 2 WANTS to kill his family even before his possession in order to gain favor with Bughuul. Why? It's never explained why Zach is always mean to his brother, save for the half-assed implication that Dylan and Courtney are weak. The point of a sequel is to immerse the viewer further into the story. Instead, this sequel was only made to make more mock-Super 8 snuff films.",1499731200,,982,4.851190476190476
7454805,2,B01608JL64,"Fleeing an abusive husband, Courtney (Shannyn Sossamon; Wayward Pines, Sleepy Hollow, One Missed Call, The Day) secretly moves to a family-owned property with her twin sons, Dylan and Zach.  Little did she know, something awful happened at the property.

Her sons are the worst twins ever.  They fight constantly and rely on each other for nothing.  Dylan is a special boy.  Hes been seeing the boogeymen in his closet, having freaky nightmares and macabre daytime visions, and he has some ghostly young friends who share old 8mm family snuff films.  For whatever reason, Zach not only knows about all this, but hes jealous!

Our now-ex-deputy (James Ransone; Sinister, Prom Night) senses the horrors that befell the Oswalt family (in part 1) will somehow happen again at Courtneys hideaway.  He befriends, warns, and protects Courtney and the boys.  Then, you know, things get worse.

Even when we see them coming, some of the death scenes are unexpectedly shocking.  They feature immolation, alligator attack, electrocutionbut they seem to fall short of the horrifying impact they had in part 1.  We seem to just be going through the motions.  It feels like the filmmakers tried, but were just less inspired than the original Sinister (2012) team.  Moreover, Bughuul just didn't feel right.  He seemed more human.  Less other-worldly; less demonic.  Bughuul, the eater of children, remains unnaturally unnerving.  But however creepy he is in this film, its still notably less than he once was.

Another downgraded aspect of this sequel is that everything seems too organized.  Bughuul has hired kid ghost interns to do his recruiting and he seems to be running an undead kinder-horror school complete with a home video film curriculum.  Theres practically a schedule and demerit system.  The terror of discovery (previously endured by Ethan Hawke) just isn't here, and its the very thing that gave the original its gut-punching impact.  At least its rated-Ras horror should be.

None of part 1s soul-rattling magic is to be found here in director Ciar&aacute;n Foys (Citadel) sequel, and the third act is most disappointing of this sequel.  Sigh oh well.  The film was mildly entertaining and I don't regret giving it a shot.  But, that said, Im not recommending this to anyone.  It really has no merits.  Shame.",1495152000,,2314,5.079787234042553
7454806,3,B01608JL64,Some movies don't need a part 2. It was not very scary and predictable. The new films in the attic offered more gore. The plot was thinly stretched and bordered on ridiculous.

7454816,3,B01608JL64,"The upside of this movie is that the producers managed to find two good child actors to play the roles of the twins. Child actors almost always overact, and it just ruins everything. These guys were good; seemed like the two normal kids they were supposed to seem. But the story wasn't interesting, and I think that's because the characters were so static; there was no hope of redemption because there was nothing to redeem. The fact that this family was haunted felt random. The subplot involving a jealous ex-husband had hope but wasn't compelling or compellingly played, except as a disposable character we won't care about too much when (SPOILER ALERT) he gets fried in the end.",1484438400,2,683,4.796610169491525

Really what I think made this movie though two sub plots.  One the guy trying to find what it was that killed his friend and destroy it.  Two the abusive relationship of a women and her ex and the guy avenging his friend becomes the hero and saves said madden from the bad experience. The main sequence is alright to, it has more to do with how the demon works.  I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you've seen the first and understood it entirely otherwise you won't get this one.  I like how they still kind of made it not so Christy, there were christian elements in it but it was more like ""yeah Christianity and others what about them"". It is scary in the since of build up terror tension as well as jump. I recommend this if you like good paranormal ghostish type movies.",1476403200,,930,4.358381502890174

7454831,2,B01608JL64,"Tries to be too many things at once and doesn't succeed at any of them. Not scary nor creepy, but also lacks depth in the mythology... Seriously, we learn nothing new that we didn't already know from the first installment. The next one better involve getting trapped in Baghoul's realm and having to find our way back.

The only good thing about this movie is James Ransone. He's so hot that it makes it worth it just to see his adorable face. His character has gotten so bland after the first one, though. They should have kept some of his comedic qualities, instead of failing so hard at a fake, cookie cutter almost-romance (so blah and overdone, not to mention feeling incredibly forced).",1473811200,,692,4.626016260162602
7454832,5,B01608JL64,"I'm very much biased towards Bughuul (Mr. Boogie whatever), as in I like the idea of a dark god of an ancient pagan religion. I like that it focus on the kid side of things where as the first focused on the adult perspective. The Christian add on was a little unnecessary, but since it was centered off of modern time then I can see why Deputy went to a church in the beginning. I'm frustrated that we really don't learn anything new about Bughuul. Everything that they stated that he feeds off of innocence stolen from children was kinda off. Especially since they have him a bit more of a Trickster in the first one.

But from me on a serious note. The movie offers nothing new except from a different point of view which makes it interesting to see how it was with Ashley and Trevor in the first movie. The first movie doesn't hide the obvious hint that Bughuul or something other supernatural did the Professor in. Mr. Deputy seemed like a forced addition, and I really don't see why he was a suspect to the killings in the first movie. The relationship between the children's mother, and him was SERIOUSLY forced. Like getting high on the night he's staying over. OH-kay. The washing between the aggressiveness between the kids and them being afraid of Bughuul at times was forced too.

Overall, the movie is VERY easily to overlook, sleep through, and overall ignore if you're not attached to anything of the sequel.",1473292800,,1422,4.55078125

7454837,4,B01608JL64,"The first ""Sinister"" film seemed to rival the still unsurpassed ""Session 9"" by Brad Anderson to me when I saw it in the theater.

It relies more on gimmicks, of course, the ""tapes"" that Ethan Hawke finds and the more obviously occult component, but when I saw it I had to actually conceal the amount of terror I'd absorbed.  ""Bagul"", the professional wrestling looking supernatural creature who eats the souls of children.

Somehow the atmosphere of ""true crime"" writing (meant indeed for metaphysical punishment) and the character's drivenness despite his family's need really ratchets it up to a terrifying movie.

I am not in the majority.  I think this is scary too, even though it doesn't quite match the first.  Ziggy from the Wire is in it as the ex deputy sheriff of the town that the ill fated Ethan Hawke tried to leave, and the lady from the Insidious movie plays the mom of the kids related to his kids.

  The director pulls no punches.

The ending was stupid.  A ham radio has what to do with what?  And they use Bagul himself too often.

7454849,5,B01608JL64,"Maybe I shouldn't review Sinister 2 since I've never seen Sinister 1, but this movie was SO good, pretty easy to follow along to the story (once it gets going that is- pretty confusing for the first 20-30 minutes), has TREMENDOUS atmosphere and doesn't seem to have any requirements in watching the first Sinister film first since I never got lost, I can't help but talk about it!

I just love those country farmhouse settings!  In this movie two sons (Dartanian Sloan and Robert Daniel Sloan who are apparently real-life brothers) are living with a single mother (the cute Shannyn Sossamon).  At first the mother and her two sons are confronted by a deputy(James Ransone) at the downtown grocery store.  The family somehow knows who James is based on the way he's looking at them apparently... or perhaps Shannyn senses he's eyeing her for a reason- that being James knows about the mysteriousness of her farmhouse and is digging around for more clues.

Anyway James becomes a central part of the story.  Turns out he's investigating the murders related to this really creepy demonic creature that goes by the name Bughuul (hehe, Bughuul *cues Beavis and Butthead joke*) but actually the spelling should be Bagul... which is spelled in a way that opens up the door to yet ANOTHER joke (want some butter for your bagul?)... okay enough of that!  He's basically a boogeyman.

Anyway this Bughuul character is haunting James- he even sees Bughuul's reflection through his computer monitor in one scene approaching closer and closer every time James turns towards his computer which is very creepy.  It should be noted that James is absolutely *terrified* of Bughuul which results in him getting incredibly nervous whenever he feels he's in the presence of Bughuul (the part where Bughuul enters an inactive church by the farmhouse comes to mind) but it's okay because the movie really delivers with the scary atmosphere.  Like constantly! This movie is quality atmosphere and writing from the beginning all the way to the end.  Don't walk away even for a moment.  I walked away to take a pee in the beginning and sort of regretted it.  Considering most movies drag at times I thought it would be okay to miss a few seconds but I was wrong.  I should have peed right there in the living room!

Anyway the bigger element to this story is that the youngest son -Robert Daniel Sloan- is being lured to the basement (not the attic which is supposedly where the setting takes place for the first movie- again I haven't seen that one) by ghostly children who DEMAND that he watch some of the most graphic violence imaginable involving a family.  One video shows the family hanging upside down as an alligator comes out of the water and bites their heads (which reminds me of that one stage in Earthworm Jim though obviously meant for chilling effect in the movie) and another is that the family is being buried in the snow forced to persevere the cold weather.

The strangest of the family murders involves hot coals being placed on top of metal buckets after the buckets are placed on each of the family members heads.  When the coal burns through the bucket the family's faces get burned enough to create giant holes through their skin which enables a rat to enter... and escape through the side of the dead family members necks!  Really bizarre!  Almost *too* bizarre to the point of being unrealistic, but maybe this can actually happen.  If so I'll take your word for it!  I don't want to experience it firsthand or anything.  Anyway not sure if this is the same family getting tortured in different ways or different families altogether.  Perhaps watching the first Sinister would help me better understand this one.

Anyway the little boy is sick of being woken up each night and approached/encouraged by these ghostly children to head to the basement and forced to watch these really sick movies, so he often gets frustrated and walks back to bed.  REALLY terrifying stuff seriously, especially the scene that shows the boy returning to bed, hiding under his blanket and shivering.  I was thinking ""Are those ghostly kids going to do something MORE?"" but they never do.  However after a while it's revealed to the boy that if he doesn't obey and watch the movies, he'll be forced to deal with Bughuul.  He doesn't want that. Nobody wants that!  Bughuul relies on his scary presence alone to scare the kids.  It's assumed he lives in the abandoned church.  By the way, how scary is the scene where James shines a flashlight towards the other side of the hallway and sees shadow images of the children!  REALLY good special effects here.

Another part of the story is that Dartanian, the older brother, also sees the ghostly children but they don't want anything to do with him.  At least not yet.  He's not smart enough apparently.  However that changes later when Dartanian continues to treat his younger brother like crap and and punishes him sadistically using his fists (seriously, seeing THAT kind of behavior coming from children is too much to bear!)  Shannyn Sossamon and James Ransone try to hit off a relationship but those plans never develop thanks to Lea Coco's character (LOL, not exactly a name that fits the abusive guy character!  Then again all the actors names are spelled weird in this movie).  Anyway yeah, he's the abusive ex-husband who returns and demands the two boys come with him at once or they'll get mashed potatoes to the face!  And Shannyn has to go as well since she has nowhere else to go apparently.  Knowing what kind of person this man is, the youngest son tries to reach out for help prompting James to come to the rescue.

This movie is really awesome I think.  I can't wait to see the first one.  It's just a nonstop thrill ride from beginning to end.  Farmhouses are ideal locations for horrors.  I wouldn't want them anywhere else!  The abandoned church in the backyard is really creepy too.  The ghostly children are fantastic, and the way they're written into the story without the mother suspecting anything going on in the basement is really memorable writing.  I was fully expecting Shannyn to encounter these kids but she never does.  Highly recommended.",1466294400,,6200,4.769230769230769

7454914,5,B01608JL64,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

This is actually more of a four but I wanted to give this movie a boost for its average. First off, this is an *excellent* sequel that takes a fuzzy idea from the first movie and really brings it to life. We get to see ""Deputy So and So"" from the first picture, this time playing the leading man. The actor deserves that; he's better than just comic relief. In this movie we get to see how a kid gets recruited into murdering his/her own family. They could have done more with this, but they did include enough for us to guess at more: Dylan is the mom's favorite, the dad may have preferred Zachary but that probably didn't save him from his share of beatings, there was doubtless a lot of resentment against the mom for allowing the beatings but also resentment for making the kids leave home and live on the run, and the ghost children played Zachary like a fiddle in letting him think they chose Dylan over him until Zachary felt desperate to prove himself.

We also learn more about Buguul or whatever its name is, what it is, how it is summoned, how our ex-Deputy has been interfering by breaking the chain of house to house (you live in a house where Buguul killed then you move, then Buguul kills you in your new home; then a new family moves into the home where you were killed and then they move, and Buguul kills them in their new home). Ex-Deputy has been burning down houses before they can be occupied again, which has earned him some creepy moments from Buguul.

So seeing what must have been happening behind the scenes with the girl from the first movie (and she makes an appearance in this one) is interesting, and knowing a little more about the requirements for summoning the demon are more clear. Still unclear is why a kid would want to do this at all? The ghost children are eager to get new recruits, but they are terrified of Buguul. Maybe the rule is, if you can get a new one, he won't bother you.

Overall, fun movie with an interesting story.",1455753600,,1999,4.394594594594595

First off, I didn't see it in theaters because it got such low ratings on review sites, instead I waited until it came to Redbox and even then I used a coupon to get to see it for free.

Okay, what made the first movie so scary was the creepy demon Buguhuul (Or however you spell his name, from here on out I will just refer to him as ""the demon"").  So in the first movie the demon makes several appearances and our main character watches these films on the 8mm film reels and sees these horrible murders.  Slowly he pieces together what the demon's plans are and tries to flee to safety but is too late and he is killed when the demon takes over his own child and she kills her parents.

Well this movie instead focuses on a bitter custody battle over 2 little boys, one who is a psychopath, the other is a complete wimp, the mom is a total doormat and the father is an egotistical psychopathic control freak who beats his kids and his wife.  Oh and once in a while some ghost kids show up and watch ""scary"" movies with the 2 boys.  And the demon from the first movie?  I think he shows up like 3 or 4 times and each time he showed up, he wasn't scary at all, he was just kind of there.  The movie tried to make him scary by putting in orchestra stings when he would suddenly appear and try to scare the viewer but it wasn't scary at all, it was just predictable.

This movie is just a complete waste of time and money.  If you liked the first movie, don't bother seeing this one, it is no where near as good as the original movie.  Give this one a pass.",1455408000,2,1787,3.991549295774648

7454945,2,B01608JL64,"The opportunity and potential to make a sequel to a relatively good movie even better existed for the movie ""Sinister"" and I believed that from the moment I saw that movie a few months ago. In fact, I recall that I was pleased when I saw the first trailer for ""Sinister 2"" shortly after having seen Sinister.

Obviously, Sinister had been released a year or so before I even knew the movie existed. Last night, I decided to rent the movie ""Sinister 2"" but I first decided to see what kind of reviews had been written about it. I must admit that the reviews were not very flattering and as a result, I decided not to spend the extra money for the high definition version.

I must admit that the movie actually started out good. I would say that it opened in a 'tongue-in-cheek' way and was actually progressing quite well. Unfortunately, the fact that the potential for the sequel to have at the very least, as good a script and plot as its predecessor, makes it even that much more of a shame at the way the writers inexplicably missed that opportunity and potential, just that much worse.

It seemed as if the writers didn't know what they really wanted to base the foundation of this movie on. Some of the professionally written reviews about the movie believed that the writers should have played on the child-abuse angle. Frankly, I disagree and believe that the writers should have stayed with the less tangible, ""unknown origin"" approach that the first movie seem to be based on.

Many of the original versions of Japanese horror films often don't include an explanation of any kind for whatever caused a particular apparition to become malevolent or even exist in the first place. Some acclaimed horror movies like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" in their original, ""native Japanese, version actually offered no explanation for the evil forces that drove the apparition's action.

When those movies were redone in an English version, they were rewritten to add an explanation into the story. This is particularly so with ""The Ring"". For those of you who haven't seen the original version of that movie, (subtitles and all), I strongly recommend you do. I think you may find the movie seems to be more potent in its original form without the explanation for the malevolent, evil spirit's behavior.

Sinister 2 is in no danger of reaching the status of the other two movies I mentioned. Ethan Hawk of course, was not in this sequel because he was killed, (by his own child), along with the other members of the family in the first movie, Sinister. Nevertheless, even if he had been brought into the sequel somehow, (it wouldnt have been the first time), it wouldnt have helped the plot in this sequel.

I've given the movie two stars and in fact would have given it two and a half if I could. However, the two star credit is for the acting and filming/editing of the movie. However, no matter how good the acting or how well it was filmed and edited, the story had a ""vaporous"" plot and nothing else about the movie couldve saved it.

Obviously, I don't recommend the movie and certainly don't recommend paying anything to see it. You won't miss much if you just wait and watch the ""edited for TV"" version. If you do wait, I promise that won't feel as bad about having lost an hour and a half of your time.

It loses out on the surprise and discovery elements that the first movie had, since we already know about the corruption and collection cycles Bughuul employs for feeding, but it still manages to have a nice twist to it and a whole new assortment of horrific family murder videos from another of the cruel god's cycles.
It was a pleasant surprise to see former Deputy So-and-So back again, and to discover that he has been busy since the death (and related disappearance) of Ellison's family. He explored far deeper into the history and lore associated with Bughuul than Ellison had a chance to, and has been tracking down more and more of the locations associated with cycles outside of the one that claimed Ellison's daughter and has been torching the homes to bring these to a close.
The sequel benefits from something the first movie didn't really have while focusing on unraveling the mystery, the ability to genuinely get to know the children and develop sympathy for the soon-to-be victims...and that makes it all the more disturbing.",1453939200,,1155,4.838383838383838

7455065,2,B01608JL64,"""Sinister 2"" falls way short of the first film in a few different ways. For one thing the story and plot this time around is very convoluted, almost to the point of confusion. I can understand the writers wanting to add layers to the stories' foundation, but it was not done in a way that makes the film interesting. I think the plot really took a big step back in this one, because you don't get the feeling that Baghuul is the central cause of fright and terror. The first film does this very effectively. Baghuul is more of an afterthought in this sequel. The film further loses it's scariness due to the dead children (Baghuul's victims) being seen and heard throughout the ENTIRE movie. This really takes the mystery and suspense away -- even though we already know why Baghuul hunts and collects them from the original story. The way these children interact with the twin boys also makes it less of a scary situation in general.

**Note: There is slight spoiler information in the following comments!

I thought the acting was subpar -- not horrible, but definitely could have been better. Many of the choices the characters made, especially in the second-half of the movie, did not make much sense and were pretty unrealistic. **For an example, the behavior of one of the twins drastically changes all of a sudden. He goes from being a normal boy, being a good brother and son, to becoming completely evil in nature. It was a very drastic and baffling change in behavior and personality that really had no explanation. In the original we come to understand that the children taken by Baghuul were not inherently evil. Rather they were merely being influenced by him to do his wicked deeds (i.e. taking part in the murder of their families). The filmmakers kind of deviate from that concept in the sequel, and again, it's not effective or compelling.

Overall ""Sinister 2"" is convoluted and flat. There is no real mystery and the chilling mood and atmosphere is missing from this one. If they are planning to make a third installment I just hope they go back and revisit the ideas and concepts that made the first one a very disturbing horror film. And of course it needs to be better communicated than this movie tries to do. I didn't hate ""Sinister 2,"" but at the same time it also is pretty forgettable and not worth the current price of rental.",1452988800,,2354,4.640287769784172

7455072,2,B01608JL64,"Sinister 2 dispenses with the atmosphere and relegates the perennial baddie, Bughuul, to essentially a running cameo since he has maybe 20 seconds of overall screen time (all of which are jump scares telegraphed so well in advance that it zaps them of even the most basic fear factor of surprise).

Instead the focus is on his kiddie minions, who are as frightening as the Muppets. Heck, even the two boys being ""haunted"" by them aren't scared in the least by their presence, and even fight for their attention.  And they're so poorly introduced that it takes awhile to even realize they're ghosts. The ghost children wish to recruit one of the boys, so they visit him nightly with a choice to either be tormented by nightmares, or watch a series of snuff films that each of them has made. He's informed he must watch ""every one"" with no explanation as to why.

The ""scares"" are few and far between...and pretty lame. A symbol of Bughuul pops up on a laptop screen and starts to drip blood, an antique radio-thingy jumps to life with ghostly voices, people run down halls that are ridiculously streaked with blood (presumably to give the impression that something REALLY BAD must have happened there)... it's all pretty pedestrian and I'd think only frightening to children under the age of 7.

The plot is paper thin, and since they gave more screen time to super8 films of random people getting murdered in preposterous ways rather than building up any actual character development, I won't even bother talking about it. However, in the brief time Bughuul was actually on-screen, I was so unengaged from the film that I had time to ponder just why a Babylonian demon who eats children would be dressed in a modern fitted suit (with the shirt collar fashionably left open for those seeking a titillating flash of demon clavicle). Perhaps he shops at JoS. A. Bughuul.",1452729600,8,1867,4.753086419753086

7455076,3,B01608JL64,"I have to preface this review by saying I loved Sinister.  I like mystery and jumps more than blood and gore.  Sinister fulfilled my preferences and kept most of the brutality off-camera.  I was nervous they would make the sequel more violent because they didn't have the star power they had for the original.  Happily they didn't.

James Ransone IS the movie.  I'm so glad they brought back the earnest, sincere, nervous, funny and lovable Deputy So and So.  Watching him is almost like seeing yourself in the situation.  I'd be terrified and so is our Deputy.  He's so relatable which brings something special to the film.  The rest of the cast is good (including the twins).  The film is slightly more violent than the original.  You do see a little more of the home movies content but not everything.  The one misstep in the film were Baghul's ghost children.  Like Baghul I think they were more frightening when they didn't speak.  Their quiet presence in the original was unnerving.  In the sequel their conversations actually destroy the tension built to those points in the film.  At times their dialogue is unintentionally funny.  They come off more like self-serving brats than Baghul's victims.  Sometimes less is more and if they are considering Sinister 3 the writers might want to keep that in mind.  Just imagine Baghul speaking; it would destroy the mystery.  Despite this misstep I enjoyed the movie.  I considered Sinister five star and I would have given this four if the ghost children's dialogue had been edited out.",1452556800,,1537,4.8307692307692305
