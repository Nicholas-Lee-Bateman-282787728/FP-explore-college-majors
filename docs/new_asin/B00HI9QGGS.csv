6166559,5,B00HI9QGGS,This was such a fantastic movie the vision and wonderful human spirit jono Oliver has directing this film was beautiful.

6166561,5,B00HI9QGGS,"From an action-filled beginning through to an anguishing resolution, Home pulls you into an intense drama. A psychiatrist says it is a sensitive portrayal of the struggle of the mentally ill. All viewers will really care about these characters.  I saw this film as a study of great personal struggle, failure and possibility for triumph. home is a ""must see"".",1392249600,3,359,4.983333333333333
6166562,5,B00HI9QGGS,This film has been at about 40 film festivals and the director got nominated for the NAACP Image award. It's the most realistic movie out there about mental illness I've seen since Cuckoo's Nest. The performances are outstanding. The characters are so real.,1392249600,3,257,5.0
6166563,5,B00HI9QGGS,Need more movies like this......pure and honest enough to tell the stories of mental illness and the lives of the people it affects. Bravo!!!,1426464000,,141,4.916666666666667
6166564,5,B00HI9QGGS,Very inspiring. It gives hope to those who may have relatives suffering from mental illness. I loved this movie.,1413417600,,112,4.947368421052632

6166570,5,B00HI9QGGS,"""Home"" gave me a snapshot of the lives of people with troubled minds. I was taken inside a group home for people with mental illness and given access to the group sessions and daily struggles of not only the residents, but the also the staff. I felt their pain of being called ""you people"" and being looked down upon by other people. It was not difficult to understand why one of the residents felt more comfortable and secure remaining in the group home, rather than having to face the insensitivity of so called normal people. ""Home"" will touch your heart and move you to compassion for people whose minds have been injured, weakening their ability to care for themselves. The main character will inspire you by his determination and perseverance to start his life over, living independently outside the group home. In spite of all the obstacles and doubting by some of those closest to him, he continues to move toward that goal. There are some who believe he can make it, but most of all he knows he will make it.  It was not clear to me whether or not his mental illness was hereditary (mother), caused by drugs, or something else.  Details of what triggered his psychotic episodes would have been helpful as well. The directing and acting are outstanding leading to believable characters. Gbenga Akinnagbe (The Wire) as the main character Jack Hall, and Isiah Whitlock, Jr. (The Wire) as Sam give convincing performances as people suffering from mental illness, which is quite a turn from their roles in ""The Wire"".  ""Home"" will reach deep into your emotions, from the lows to the highs. By the end of the movie you will be cheering for Jack Hall and his new beginning. He made it!",1405123200,,1687,4.673400673400673
6166571,4,B00HI9QGGS,"Very touching and very real. The opening sequence is very disorienting, but effective in building empathy with the main character, and brings you into his world.",1403654400,,161,5.230769230769231
6166572,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Although shot on a small budget, the resulting movie is powerful! Home gives great insight into the world of the mentally challenged without becoming dark or depressing. The characters are endearing, making you care about them, and wanting to know so much more about each of them than the movie has time to give.",1400284800,,312,4.796296296296297
6166573,5,B00HI9QGGS,"It takes courage on the part of actors to accept stepping into the characters presented in this film. And, then to pull it off. Kudos!",1398470400,,134,4.4
6166574,4,B00HI9QGGS,A beautiful and poignant film about a difficult and too often misunderstood topic. Gbenga Akinagbe's acting is brilliant! A must see!!!,1397692800,,135,5.476190476190476
6166575,5,B00HI9QGGS,The acting was phenomenal.  The story is one which portrays real life circumstances and challenges.  Thought provoking and endearing.  A must see movie.,1397433600,,152,5.521739130434782
6166576,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Home:_____ is a striking movie from start to finish. Heartwarming & inspirational writing (Jono Oliver) coupled with masterfully played characters overflowing with valor & grit, this movie shines a light on the stigma attached to mental health issues.  Played ingeniously by Gbenga Akinnagbe, the breadth and depth of main character Jack Halls essence is stunning.  Director Jono Olivers eye for detail cannot be overstated.  No wonder it earned a nomination for a 2014 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing as well as multiple film festival awards!  You will not be disappointed!!!",1396483200,,588,5.428571428571429
6166577,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This movie was sooooo good! Highly recomend if you or a loved 1 have mental illness issues, it touches so many areas of the reality of it. If you liked the movie Silver Linings, you won't be disappointed by this movie, you will like it better!!",1396483200,,244,4.326086956521739
6166578,5,B00HI9QGGS,"HOME is a powerful and thoughtful look at one man's attempt to move beyond mental illness, rebuild a life for himself and re-establish a connection with his son. It's a simple story, but it is brought to life in such a dramatic and emotionally resonant way that few viewers will be unaffected. The performances are all first rate. Supporting cast members include many faces familiar from popular shows, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scandal-Season-3/dp/B00FR23S3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scandal: Season 3</a>'s Joe Morton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Cards-Season-2/dp/B00J5LXT44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Cards: Season 2</a>'s Tawny Cypress, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-The-Complete-Series/dp/B005NFJAWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire: The Complete Series</a>'s Isiah Whitlock Jr. But the movie is made truly unforgettable by the performance of Gbenga Akinnagbe as Jack Hall. Akinnagbe, who played the ruthless Chris Partlow in The Wire and is now Erik Ritter on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Live-Another-Day-HD/dp/B00JIX8C0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24: Live Another Day [HD</a>], is so utterly convincing, so immersed in this character that the movie takes on a level of realism that it almost feels like a documentary. This is the kind of portrayal of mental illness not normally seen in a feature movie and writer-director Jono Oliver lets the story unfold in a way that both heightens the tension and feels completely natural. Don't let the seemingly ""heavy"" topic fool you. HOME is riveting and unforgettable. A must-see.",1396483200,3,1769,7.388625592417061
6166579,5,B00HI9QGGS,Amazing film! The director does an exceptional job depicting mental illness and the struggles individuals face. A must see film!,1395705600,,128,5.45
6166580,5,B00HI9QGGS,"It was brilliantly written, directed and acted.  The whole feel of the movie down to the set dressing, costume design and the content of the subject matter of how a man with mental illness struggles to make his life better.  It is honest and truly touching.  This is right up there with all the Oscar nominated films.  The cast is phenomenal and get out the tissues.  You WILL cry!",1395705600,,381,4.463768115942029
6166581,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This is a wonderful story, beautifully told. Jack's story could be almost anyone's. You root for him, cry with him, and hold your breath as he faces each new challenge.  The acting is powerful and the direction is stellar.  Highly recommended!",1392768000,2,243,4.902439024390244
6166582,5,B00HI9QGGS,"""Home"" this sensitive, brilliantly acted film reminds us how often we take our own home for granted. ""Home"" let's us see a population that works so hard to live in their own home. A must-see movie.",1392768000,3,197,4.5
6166583,5,B00HI9QGGS,"I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice last year, once at a screening and once at a NY film festival.  I have a family member with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and I felt this movie pretty accurately portrayed life in NYC for someone with a mental health disorder.  Most importantly though, I found the movie fast paced and entertaining.  Home is a hidden gem amongst the indie films of 2013.",1392595200,9,406,4.45945945945946
6166584,5,B00HI9QGGS,"""Home:___"" had me captivated from beginning to end. You are so drawn in to each and every character but most of all you desperately want Jack to succeed.

It's truly a gift.",1392595200,10,339,4.666666666666667
6166585,5,B00HI9QGGS,"I have not been able to find many films that connect and inspire on multiple levels like this. Incredibly well-crafted story of adversity, hope and triumph that brings light to a subject much too often kept in the dark. A must see!",1392595200,5,231,4.523809523809524

6166587,5,B00HI9QGGS,I've seen this film seven times and every time it resonates with emotional impact for me. Can't wait to see it again.,1392508800,6,117,4.363636363636363
6166588,5,B00HI9QGGS,"There is a reason that Home was nominated by the NAACP Image Awards for best directing alongside films like Mandela, 12 Years a Slave, and The Butler. It is one of the best ensemble pieces of acting I've seen in quite a while and the writing and directing (by Jono Oliver) managed to present a subject which is heavily stigmatized (mental illness) in a realistic, sympathetic, and highly affirming manner. The film is positively brimming with nuanced and engaging performances from true artists like Joe Morton, James McDaniel, Tawny Cypress, Victor Williams and Isaiah Whitlock - not to mention that Gbenga Akinnagbe turns in an amazingly human and sensitive portrayal of a man wrestling with the consequences of his own past and psychotic breaks as well as the system which only adds to the difficulties of re-entry into mainstream society while walking a tightrope over a blazing fire to reach his son - metaphorically. An uncommon film, uncommonly well done. Keep an eye out for Theo Stockman's scene in which he relates the pain of being casually marginalized by his date. One of many favorites in this amazingly well-acted movie. You can do a lot worse than adding this one to your collection.",1392422400,16,1199,4.911330049261084
6166589,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This movie totally deserved an NAACP Image award for director Jono Oliver. I was particularly moved by the cast's ability to take on such a difficult topic and present it with grace, beauty and care. I would recommend this movie to all viewers- it is a story about a father and a son, a story about overcoming adversity, a story about hope. Give Home a chance- you'll be so glad you did!",1392422400,6,387,4.388888888888889
6166590,5,B00HI9QGGS,A heavy subject that leaves us feeling light hearted. It's a real feel good movie and I loved it from the first scene 'till the last. Thank you Jono Oliver!,1392422400,3,156,4.233333333333333
6166591,5,B00HI9QGGS,This movie captured my attention from the beginning to the end. I could not help but empathize with Jack as strived to make his life better; this movie puts a personal face on the struggles faced by those who have mental illness. I encourage everyone to see this movie.,1392336000,4,269,4.510204081632653

8632976,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Great story, heartfelt and touching. Great acting by a talented cast. You really thought the lead actor was a little slow on the uptick. This movie is a keeper for my library and I'll watch it over and over again.",1470614400,,213,4.35
8632977,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Excellent slice of life from a man struggling with mental illness. The stigma tied to the disease makes it difficult to move ahead in his life but he perseveres. I could not help but want to cheer him on, getting upset when anyone called him ""crazy"" or such.  Interesting side story lines complete the movie. I highly recommend watching!",1462752000,,337,4.711864406779661
8632978,5,B00HI9QGGS,This is a very moving and realistic portrayal of recovery from mental illness.  It shows very poignantly and accurately what the individual goes through and what the family experiences.  The acting is outstanding.  I wish everyone in America would see this film.  I think it would  greatly reduce the stigma attached to serious mental illness and humanize  those coping with it.,1459382400,,378,5.114754098360656
8632979,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This is as elegant a telling of a painful story as possible. Gripping from the opening scene until the end. Did not see a single flaw, no pretense, nothing trite or clever -- just exquisite storytelling. Some reviewers will say ""gritty,"" ""tough"" or whatnot, but ignore their too-refined vision. The real story here is the web of passions and dreams, fears and hopes among the characters, the invisible threads among which they are entangled and their true-hearted struggles to find home. And superb acting across the board.",1453852800,,523,5.022988505747127
8632980,5,B00HI9QGGS,"I just watched the film on Netflix and immediately came here to purchase.  Excellent film - with an amazing cast.  Everyone did a wonderful job with their characters, very realistic.  Gbenga Akinnagbe is awesome as Jack - he plays the character with such sympathy and emotion that you can't help but want things to work out for his character.  A must see film.",1445904000,,360,4.666666666666667
8632981,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This is a very well-done film that digs deeply and explores city life and race from a very mature and sophisticated viewpoint.  The characters are drawn with care, and are far from being stereotypical.  Nicely acted and directed--a winner!",1435622400,,239,5.102564102564102
8632982,5,B00HI9QGGS,"This movie captivated me from the opening scenes.  It's an eye-opening entry into a world that I only casually know about - those with mental health issues and how one man fights to regain a normal life and find a true 'home' for himself after leaving a group home.  Gbenga Akinnagbe is such a great actor who I had my eye on since his menacing portrayal of an enforcer on THE WIRE; his portrayal had me in tears as he struggles to achieve his goal while making amends to his son.  Everything about this film is excellent - the actors, the writing, the production is just top notch and I'd highly advise anyone who enjoys character-driven stories to check this movie out.",1433548800,,671,4.483606557377049
8632983,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Great Movie! Very well put together, good acting and production but overall a refreshing story of a human issue, struggle, and determination in the life of an African American man.",1428192000,,180,5.033333333333333
8632984,5,B00HI9QGGS,"Writer/Director Jono Oliver tells a story about mental illness and how its reality is spreading across the world; some cases are severe while others are not, some are being treated while others are not.  Jack Hill played by Gbenga Akinnagbe's (The Wire) life seemed to be normal and on track, he was going along with his life and his family until one day his life begins to spiral out of control.  As he looks back he saw the signs of abnormality but did not really think about it (i.e. leaving his five year old on the bus by himself), times when he would black out and not remember things and when he would truly get out of control.

When Jack begins to spin totally out of control on a regular basis it was then realized by him and his loved ones that he was having psychotic episodes and was later diagnosed with a  mental illness.  During this time is when he lost the life that he knew and his family.  Now he must begin to take medication and be housed in a in-home treatment facility with others battling the similar type of mental illnesses but Jack wants his old life back. Jack begins a journey of taking the challenge of independence and being a father again to his son who is now a pre-teen and explain to his son the challenges that he is facing on a daily basis in combating mental illness.

I loved this movie because we all know of someone (or it may be you) that is experiencing mental illness; its real and need to be treated.  But one thing that we have to begin paying attention to is our own behavior in dealing with others with this illness including statements that we make.  They are people just like us but they have an imbalance that causes their brains to fire off differently. I am more conscious about whenever I  encounter someone especially someone that I don't know and they appear to be doing something that I believe to be abnormal I now just
say a prayer for them and thank God that He did not let this be a cross for me to bear.
