8466269,5,B005D3J43I,Lee Min Ho is awesome. Loved Boys over Flowers and looking to buy more CDS. Wish he would come to the states! Korean Dramas & Music. Very relaxing to listen to and dramas I've seen are very clean. No R to X like USA. I wish it wasn't so expensive to buy in the States but it's worth every penny to buy it. I hope we see them soon. If the shows I've watched are awesome and highly rated in Korea etc why are there no sequels to anything?,1466294400,,436,3.9101123595505616

The scenes are lovely and funny any LMH fan will love it lots of content. Haven't watched disk 2 yet but I'm sure will be as good as disk 1 the English subs are really good.  If you are a fan then this is for you enjoy I did hope this review helps.  Just watched 2nd disk 2nd fan meeting lots of guests kim bum yoona singing and others cf filming back stage stuff it was really funny and lovely I thinks it's worth every penny so much content if your a fan this is for you hope this review helps .",1402704000,,840,4.005988023952096

I love Lee Min-Ho and might be interested in buying this, but don't know exactly what's included. Can someone please include what I would be buying??",1346889600,5,281,4.529411764705882
