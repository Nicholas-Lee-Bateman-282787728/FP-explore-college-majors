This is a must have for us collectors.  You'll love this.  Put it in the DVD player and crank up the surround sound.  Top Notch Quality audio and visual.

2139968,3,B0002Y4T9W,"I have to say.....being at IT, seeing Phish, watching them play atop the tower and seeing all the fans was tons of fun. However, to those people who say that Phish was ""at their best"" for this one certainly haven't seen Phish at their best. It is always great to get together and share the fun of live shows and touring, but when it's the same show at a different location over and over, it gets tiring (variety is the spice of life).....maybe Phish will learn from this and stay in ""retirement"".",1142467200,,496,4.4021739130434785

2139970,5,B0002Y4T9W,"True I know many things.

ive read all your reviews which are scattered all other the place...and some of you talk about the members as if you're intimate with them or you talk about the scene and how someone or another has ruined the scene and the band itself.  Some of you also mention that you know what PHISH is capable of...my question that i would like to have an answer to and which ill have to post somewhere that is postable is:

Why can't I just walk into any reasonable store and buy a CD or a DVD that shows exactly what PHISH is capable of? Why is something that is so rare and magical and true...and AND..that can be easily and electronically captured/recorded at any time not out there for the world to buy and share?  What's this fascination with anti-mainstream?  I can only assume that since i have never been to a concert but can still clearly see the magic within ""IT"", that maybe i'm not well schooled in the art of ""it"".  But I beg to differ. This ""It"" thing has been my life's mission.  I also understand that with this DVD, finally an attempt to explain why a person would travel thousands of miles with no ticket in hand with just a chance for a miracle would do such a thing.  Please if anyone knows of any media that tries to explain the allure of PHISH any better, then by all means let me know...post it somewhere anywhere. I keep my eyes out for every PHISH release but with constant dissapointment until now...because finally someone is trying to explain the unexplainable and what ""it"" is all about and trying to actually show it on a DVD.

Despite your opinions about the production quality or the various annoyances that are caused by editing...something is there that i can see, that i have never seen in any product released by PHISH. I cant buy or share your memories of a certain concert.  In fact even your own memories (yes im talking to you sitting there) are even gone to you and are more like a dream which cant be remembered with only faint feelings and time warped images. And perhaps if you went back to that concert and stood outside yourself, by yourself, but be in a different mood, like the mood you are in now...would the concert be the same to you?  Maybe the concert really wasn't that great as you thought...maybe it was the chemicals...maybe it was just a moment in time for you.  Or perhaps it was even better...or the same.

I digress.

So please, if there is some product out there that maybe i haven't heard of, then please let me know....

...through telepathy apparently.  And if that doesnt work then become a production company and follow every move PHISH makes so you can capture it...and edit it to your liking.

Or if you are a true to the bone phish head and you must know the band intimately, then help explain to the band itself/thierself, the importance of thier music and that maybe they shouldnt rest until they definitively capture that moment that says ""hey! look here! this is what this whole thing is all about.""  Bamm right here and undeniable.  Just help the Band catch a clue.  So the rest of the world with all the mainstreamers might also catch a clue.  PHISH heads live in a very small world that is surrounded by countless other worlds that go on everday with or with out them.

Its about perspective, hard work, and something thats called ""it"" and then spreading it!...ie producing, packaging, marketing and selling it!

Get with it!!!!!!",1141084800,2,3422,4.501618122977346
2139971,4,B0002Y4T9W,"Good DVD/Movie. Viewer need not know a lot about the band. Kind of short. Would have loved to see more behind-the-scenes footage. Irritating at times how the band interviews cut into songs. Overall, good DVD.",1138406400,,208,4.9714285714285715

2139974,5,B0002Y4T9W,"I purchased ""Phish: Live in Las Vegas"" a while ago, and I was somewhat shocked at the poor quality video throughout the DVD.

This DVD, however, is excellent.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this concert. It is particularly of interest to those who have never been to a Phish concert (like myself), as this DVD provides not just video from the concert, but interviews of the band and clips from around the festival.  I feel that it was designed as a work of art of sorts, as it includes a lot of artistic video effects, such as slow-motion, and granulation. The jams are cut short, and there are some interviews that come up during spacier jams, but it keeps things interesting. If you want to hear the band jam, listen to a Live Phish cd.  If you want to have a look at what goes on during a Phish concert, buy this DVD.

  Some claim that the band is not having any fun while they are playing, and so the concert is not a good one.  I feel differently, as i think the band is really concentrating on making the music to be art, and not just spur of the moment jam.

  The DVD is not perfect, but i am sure that in any DVD, there will be some minor errors pertaining to sync and what not. The errors made are only aggrivating to those who are looking for something to be angry with. It is obvious that the producer spent large amounts of time working on this DVD, and it shows thanks to how well every aspect of the DVD is worked together, from the interviews to the clips of random sightings at the festival to set up for the festival, etc.

  The point is, this high quality DVD captures an incredible concert, giving the viewer a taste of the entire festival.",1126051200,3,1667,4.284345047923322

The dvd is interspersed with statements from the band members about what IT is, and what their music stands for.

2139988,1,B0002Y4T9W,"I Feel bad for all the people who said that the show rocked just from watching the DVD.  IT was a mess from the word go.  The parking situation was horrible.  The scene was all pharmies and no fun.  Most of the people there (including Trey and the rest of the band) were less than interested in the music.  The whole concert was obviuosly an excuse to peddle this awful DVD.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy into IT.",1111622400,2,415,4.189873417721519
2139989,2,B0002Y4T9W,"Be warned...this dvd doesn't even include whole songs! Obviously the director learned nothing from the great rock concert docs of the past (Last Waltz, Gimme Shelter, The Wall Live, etc.). This is essentially various songs (heavily edited) interspersed with talking head interviews with the band. I would rather see/hear 3 or 4 songs in their entirety than just snippets of 10. And what the hell is with the slo-mo, zoom, out-of-focus, shots throughout. A great band doesn't need effects, just put the camera on 'em and record. THAT'S IT. On the plus side, the photography is breathtaking and the picture quality is A+. Overall it's worth it as a document of a HUGELY underrated band and their last great big show (before 2004 where they essentially became parodies of themselves).",1107820800,7,781,5.015384615384615

2139991,4,B0002Y4T9W,"...the first cd kills this dvd.  It's a PBS show with badly synched audio/video, little actual music, and a band, whose publicist shouldn't allow them to speak in public, giving their thoughts on life.  These guys are great musicians and everything, but try to understand what they're saying (not the words, but the actual meaning of the sentences) and you'll get a nosebleed.
  ON THE OTHER HAND... I haven't been able to finish the second cd in 2 weeks because it's so freakin' good.  Trey Anastasio is phenominal, and his name's cool.  The keyboard player is kinda annoying musically/conversationally.  Mike Fishman is kind of bland to share the name of the band.  ...and what's up with the drummer??  He seems intelligent but wears muumuus?!",1104624000,3,745,4.943548387096774
2139992,5,B0002Y4T9W,"I just got this DVD for Christmas and I am just blown away.  I unfortunately came into appreciating Phish at the tail end of it all.  This DVD is a great glimpse into the band as a whole, their philosophies and takes on the music.  Bittersweet Motel was a great DVD, but this DVD actually takes the time to talk to the other members, which is essential.  That aside, the interviews with Trey during the main feature on Disc 1 really show his passion for the music and fans.  Just look at his eyes when he's talking about sharing the moment with the fans.  Personally, that really did it for me.  But anyways, its an amazing DVD, great quality, top-notch!",1103846400,3,654,4.4
2139993,3,B0002Y4T9W,"After reading all of the rave reviews already here, I decided to point out a few of the GLARING screw-ups on this DVD, as well as a few things that I didn't like. First of all, I cannot believe that no one has mentioned the HUGE mistake in Seven Below. Whenever the DVD cuts to the close-up shot of Trey's hands, the video isn't timed right with the audio. I was absolutely shocked when I first saw this. How could such a high budget production make such a huge error? It's extremely annoying to see Trey play something three or four seconds before it is actually played. Another mistake (more proof that it was hastely rushed to release) is the fact that it says Aug. 2 & 3 2004 on the DVD case when the festival took place in 2003. While this doesn't REALLY make a difference, it is an error that you wouldn't expect to see.

Other than this, I was disapointed with the poor job they did cutting out long jam sections. While I am personally against cutting out a jam no matter what the circumstances, I understand why it has to be done. That being said, there is a right and a wrong way to do it. For example, in Chalkdust Torture on disc 1 most of the jam is cut for time. This would be alright except for the fact that the outro lick in Chalkdust was played  at a very fast pace at IT. This makes for an extremely abrupt cut from the begining to the jam to the end of the jam, resulting in a sudden change in beat that just sounds extremely awkward.

Another complaint is the speed at which all of the cuts are made. When watching a DVD of a concert I like to focus as much as possible on the music. However, with all of the really fast cuts and weird effects and stuff that were put on this DVD, it's very hard to do. I found them distracting and annoying throughout disc 1. Disc 2 was much less manicured and I enjoyed it much more.

Lastly, Page, as usual, gets very little attention. But I've grown to accept the fact that Page never gets the attention he derseves on any DVD.",1101945600,40,1984,4.18586387434555
2139994,5,B0002Y4T9W,"Clearly, this show rocked.  I wish I could have been there.  Watching it on DVD is not a bad second option fortunately.  For those out there looking for a DVD that combines incredible music, stunning video, and excellent mastering, this is the DVD to buy.  The 5.1 audio mix doesn't make you feel as though you're in the audience - it makes you feel like you're on stage.  Having spent too much building a great home theater system, I have been waiting for IT to be released, and I was not disappointed.  Just make sure your neighbors are gone when you watch this - because you will want to crank the volume.  This is a must own for Phans and audiophiles.",1101513600,2,655,4.363636363636363
2139995,4,B0002Y4T9W,"I was at this festival in early August in the summer of 03 and I can tell you that the next best thing to being there is this dvd.  The documentary is really great because unlike Bittersweet Motel it gets everybody from the band talking and not just Trey.  I've been a huge Phish fan for a long time and I can honestly say that this is the best that they performed post hiatus.  The IT festival was the true farewell in respects to the music because to be honest it didn't get this good ever again.  I'm sure Coventry was amazingly emotional but I've heard and they mess up quite a bit.  Anyway...  I would strongly suggest buying this over the vegas dvd because the vegas dvd just sucks.  The picture quality is awful and the music blows, I cant even believe Phish released this show on dvd.  With the exception of the curtain and  a day in the life the show was awful, and you can tell they are not having a good time.. I mean seriously Trey is usually always smiling but not at this show.  The only reason I give this dvd four stars is frankly because I was there and they didn't include some of my favorite songs from that weekend on the dvd.  For example a really cool meatstick where they got the whole crowd dancing, a very cool ac/dc bag, the entire version of ghost(because it may have been one of the best in Phish history ranking up there with the live Phishs vol. 11 in denver).  Other than that the dvd has touched all bases.",1100736000,3,1438,4.227106227106227
2139996,5,B0002Y4T9W,"Like a lot of others, my phish experience started winding down well before the hiatus, never mind Coventry. Years pass, obligations accumulate, the thrill fades . . . as did the musicianship.

I remember several years ago thinking that even at 60%, PHiSH would blow away anything else out there. It seemed so obviously true. Then they actually went out and hit 60%, if that, and I wasn't so sure.

As overwhelming as Coventry was emotionally, it was underwhelming musically (at least as heard via cinema simulcast). Enter IT. This is how IT would have ended had the end been scripted. This is phish at their finest. The highest compliment I can pay is that slipping into this DVD is like stepping back to 1993 or 1995. The band is on. The scene is alive. The songs soar. 10 years from now, this is the farewell that I'll remember. As Fishman put it, at IT PHiSH was a band that could still earn ITs keep --  that deserved to be where it was. For all the memories Phish gave me, they deserve to be remembered as they were at this show. This performance may not have been the last. But, then, in some respects, IT was. $.02",1099872000,24,1121,4.405797101449275
2139997,4,B0002Y4T9W,"Watching this DVD brought back some memories...I wasn't at this particular Maine festival, but I did attend the one in '97 (aka The Great Went), so I can definitely recognize & appreciate the effort that went into what was surely another unforgettable weekend.

Nothing could actually top being at a Phish show in person, but this 2-DVD set does a pretty remarkable job recreating the vibe. Not much on here is filler...even the photo gallery is worth checking out, as it is accompanied by audio from ""IT Radio"". The PBS documentary is well done, and all four bandmembers get a fair amount of interview time. The camerawork is top-notch, and it carries over to the bonus tracks on the second disc as well...BTW, the video absolutely buries the Live at Vegas DVD, and you'll notice right away.

Some unlikely MVP performances (from the second disc) are included here, including a fiery ""Julius"" jam, an exploratory ""Chalkdust Torture"" (clocking in at 24 minutes, never derailing), and a worthy payoff from the buildup in ""Pebbles and Marbles"".

One negative is that you may notice the audio is out of sync during ""Seven Below""...it can be fixed by changing the audio settings, but it's still a minor inconvenience. And honestly, I wish some of the song highlights from the PBS special were included in their entirety on the second disc...it woulda been nice to have a complete ""Antelope"", ""Bug"", or ""You Enjoy Myself"" to round things out.

Nonetheless, ""It"" should satisfy Phish fans, and might even entice non-fans to look into the band...",1099785600,4,1539,4.907692307692308

I found it to be much more useful as a documentary than Todd Phillips' ""Bittersweet Motel.""  It focuses equal attention on every member of the band, which is nice to see in place of Trey-worshipping.  The cinematography is sometimes flashy, but always tasteful and useful in the purpose of presenting the music in its live element.

The camera work is very good (shot in HD), and the sound is pristine. Disc Two gives you straight up songs (uncut), and once again, the camera work/sound is dazzling. I like the selection of songs throughout both discs, and although I wasn't at the festival, the crowd and venue shots really give a good representation of what it must have been like. Another great thing about this DVD is the packaging. I have about 20 concert DVD's in collection, and the packaging on this is hands-down the best and most professional I've seen.

Nonetheless I purchased it when it came out and although the festival represented some very tight jamming, and a high quality second set both nights, the idea you get from the video is much different.  The interviews with the band that they go back and forth to in between songs I think is what irritates me the most.  Trey is clearly jammed through the entire production, you can hear it in the way he is talking out of the back of his throat and in the content of his interviews.

Then put it away.  Or use it as a coaster.  Or maybe use it as a wedge under a wobbly table... solving two annoyances at once.

Here's an even better suggestion: Skip this one and buy ""Phish Live in Brooklyn.""

It's hard to find anything redeeming in the concert footage on DVD #1.  The bonus material and interviews are interesting enough, but the short shots and effects of the concert footage give me a headache.  The editors of this seem to have decided that their target audience have attention spans equal to or shorter than 3 seconds (which in my estimation is about the average length of each shot on disk 1.)  In some cases, they chose to include shots where the camera was focusing on a subject (e.g. Page), but didn't manage to get focused before a cut to the next shot.  Why in the world would a documetary film editor think they needed to add their special effects?  It's about the music, man! (not cheesy editing effects)

Some might call this artistic license; I find it annoying.  Find it used for half price and skip disk #1.  Disk 2 of the fest is better.",1167264000,2,1233,4.370044052863436

Disc 1 is the special and contains a few songs with the jam sessions cut out. When i first got the DVD I watched this disc once and then never again. Not that it's bad, but the 2nd Disc is where the magic happens.

Disc 2 is uncut songs. The camera and sound are fantastic, and for the record, the audio is dead on in ""Seven Below"". The video confuses people because of the way Trey slides up to each note to get the necessary reverb for the sound he needs in the song. Back to the DVD, the only complaints I have would be that you don't get enough shots of the crowd rockin out, which is a big part of the concerts for me. All in all the shows is great and if you are a Phish fan, you should definately get this DVD.",1144886400,2,737,3.9066666666666667
