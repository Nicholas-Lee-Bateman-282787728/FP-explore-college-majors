8039214,4,B00066FA94,"York has done it again, made another budget effective horror film that has the gore and comic value any fan of horror could ask for. Was great to see Jeff Fahey go over the top in his 'terminator-esque' finale of the movie, I didn't see it coming. Tiffany Shepis was as usual just a delight to view, boy does she have spunk and sex appeal that goes way beyond zombie movies. If I had to be stuck in a coffin with anyone it certainly would be her! Couple of nasty gore scenes with exceptionally good makeup effects. All in all a good DVD. Wish there were more of them.",1246492800,,567,4.2110091743119265
8039215,4,B00066FA94,"I'm not that big of a zombie fan but this was a great little zombie comedy/horror film. A mortician creates a serum that can revive the dead for one hour and he uses them to do his bidding. As the story unfolds, the mortician plans to get revenge on his ex-wife for attempting to ruin his life and it is up to his assistant to stop him.

A B-movie in every sense of the word, it isn't meant to be taken seriously. A good movie to sit down and laugh at. Not because it's bad but because it's hilarious.

Highlighted by great performances by Tiffany Shepis, Jeff Fahey and Robert Donavan.",1240099200,,586,4.27027027027027
8039216,4,B00066FA94,"This movie is about a mortician who made a serum to bring back the dead to do his biding. He ultimately tries to use them to get back at his ex-wife for cheating on him with the town sheriff. I know it sounds weak, but there is a decent cast including my favorite scream queen, Tiffany Shepis, who plays the sheriff's daughter.
Yeah we're not looking at Oscar material, but for a zombie film with a budget, it actually has a nice plot and does what I think every zombie movie should do. It makes fun of itself.",1221264000,2,510,4.214285714285714
8039217,4,B00066FA94,"OK So its pretty much a rip-off of Re-Animator....the crazy Doctor/Mortician with a serum that can raise the dead he accidently made while trying to invent a new embalming fluid... and its fluorescent green too. Only thing is it only last for an hour...so he has to keep injecting the corpses and they become addicted to it, but in order for them to get their fix, they need to do his evil bidding...killing off the townspeople, including his ex-wife, who are trying to shut his mortuary down to build a shopping mall. It is more of a Comedy, and i did get a few chuckles out of it (a zombie with a boner...funny stuff!). The zombies look good, and there is plenty of gore, many severed limbs and even some flesh eating! Some of the Zombies can talk and they are able to understand and take orders (the morticain explains that there is some Brain damage, depending on how long they were dead) The movie was entertaining and I didn't have my finger on the fast forward button (unlike some of the other so called zombie films that I have seen lately). I will gladly add this to my Zombie DVD collection! The DVD itself is bare bones... There Isn't even a Title Menu, No scene selection, and No extras. Just one Trailer at the begining, and then goes right into the movie (there are some chapter stops) I also Don't know why this is hard to find, I only seen it at Amazon (not even any on eBay) the ship date was 5-6 weeks, then the day my copy was shipped from Amazon they changed its status to ""Currently Unavailable""....hmmm?...wonder why??? I would say if your a Zombie fan check it out, its at least worth a rental...if you can find it anywhere.",1126224000,14,1647,4.421052631578948
