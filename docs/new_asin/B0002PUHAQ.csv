2113352,5,B0002PUHAQ,The DVD is great! Seeing the English and Welsh countryside made me feel like I just went on a short trip. The DVD is not only beautiful but also informative. I can't wait to see another travel guide made by the producer of this video about another country.,1187740800,11,256,4.354166666666667

2113354,5,B0002PUHAQ,"This video covers a wide range of sites including: London - see the changing of the Guard, Buckingham Palace, beautiful parks and London's nightlife and museums.

From the parks of London to the cliffs of Dover, the mystery of Stonehenge, and the majestic castles of Edinburgh, Scotland, this release also doubles as a great vacation planner for those looking to explore foreign lands.""",1178841600,6,910,5.363636363636363
2113355,4,B0002PUHAQ,"Can be a bit dull and the background music leaves much to be desired; however, it is an excellent guide to England.",1171152000,16,115,4.2727272727272725
8030407,5,B0002PUHAQ,Old style but covers a wild range sites.,1502064000,,40,4.125
8030408,3,B0002PUHAQ,I was a little disappointed the dvd wasn't longer.  It seems there could have been much more to show in something like this,1369872000,,123,4.3478260869565215
8030409,1,B0002PUHAQ,"This looks like a high school production, please save your $8... you'd be better off bludgeoning yourself to death with a Frommer's guide.",1338422400,,138,5.043478260869565
8030410,1,B0002PUHAQ,Total waste of money.  The photographer was more interested in swans and soldiers than actual sites.  The music was really annoying as was the voice over.,1307232000,,154,4.884615384615385
8030411,5,B0002PUHAQ,"This video was spectacular! It included Britain's most famous cities and introduced me to the local people and their daily lives. The background music was beautiful including classical melodies, which perfectly matched the contents of the videos. The narration was vivid and interesting especially because I enjoyed the narrator's voice.",1244937600,3,337,5.76
8030412,1,B0002PUHAQ,"I was so looking forward to sitting down and watching this video and was irritated from the get-go.  First, the background music is obnoxious and does not fit the mood of the video. Second, if you can get past the cutesy phrases, the narrators voice is annoying.  Third, there are some incorrect facts.  Fourth, I have no idea why we were subjected to footage of Desert Storm.  And finally, I think by now, that any of us who have an interest in England, have seen at least a hundred times the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.  It is not necessary to belabor that point twice in the video.  There were a couple of interesting video shots of a few towns in England, but they were too limited to give you a real feel for the place.  Overall, very disappointing.  I am sure that England has so much more to offer.",1240272000,4,821,4.355263157894737
8030413,2,B0002PUHAQ,"It's a basic, old-style, fairly jolly ""let's go to Britain"" video. Not exactly ""globetrekker"", but it does the job.",1229212800,3,115,5.105263157894737
8030414,5,B0002PUHAQ,"If you haven't been to Britain, then you MUST have this video. You'll feel like you're there -- and it will make you want to go!

If you have been to Britain, then this video reminds you of all the photos and videos you should have taken!

Either way, it's a Must Have.",1221264000,5,269,4.056603773584905
8030415,5,B0002PUHAQ,This DVD is absolutely wonderful. I have really enjoyed viewing all the sites and it makes me want to visit my roots even more. The photography was amazing and it is something that I have enjoyed watching more than once.,1191110400,12,220,4.525
8030416,5,B0002PUHAQ,A Five Star video that involves much of the British Isles!  It is highly recommended for first time visitors and also provides an enjoyable reminder for those who have already visited Britain. The video quality is excellent. I had been there when I was in the Navy.,1191024000,7,265,4.638297872340425
