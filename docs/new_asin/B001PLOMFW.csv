8333721,5,B001PLOMFW,"The picture you see on the cover of this DVD is Maya Plisetskaya in a pose as she dances in the ballet ""The Fountain of Bakhchisarai"". Maya really loved this ballet, but she only liked to dance the part of Zarema, the once favorite concubine of Khan Girzi (also spelled Girey).  In a fit of jealosy, Zarema has killed Maris (also called Maria), who the Khan kidnapped and subsequently fell in love with. What we see here, is Zarema offering her breast to the Khan's knife. I won't tell you any more of the story, except to say that this is the only known ballet where the two prima ballerinas of the Bolshoi, Galina Ulanova and Maya Plisetskaya dance together in the same ballet. But guess what? The Fountain of Bakhchisarai ballet is not on this disc. It is on another DVD called Stars of the Russian Ballet, true, but not this one. It's on Kultur D1199.

Now, I'm going to give you a lot of information you won't find any where else, so pay attention. This is another DVD called Stars of the Russian Ballet. In the lower left corner it says Vol. 1. Every word on the keepcase and disc is in the Russian language, except the disc does have Stars of the Russian Ballet in English. You will have to buy the DVD to get this information, and then only if you select the chapters menu. I will give you the chapter number, title, date filmed, music composer, and the dancers.

Some of the color is a bit faded the sound is good but you will have to turn the volume down quite a bit. There are dances on these discs which can be found on other DVDs, but there is also some very good new stuff here also. The total running time is 121 mnhyT (whatever that means). It's in the 3:4 ratio video format, naturally. I liked everything on the DVD. I think you will too........Richard.",1262649600,15,3725,5.429065743944637
