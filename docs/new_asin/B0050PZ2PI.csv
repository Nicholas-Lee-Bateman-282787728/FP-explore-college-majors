These 2 are why I bought both movies. Cary didn't seem to be used much,but he was great here.",1405382400,,278,4.6938775510204085
8451636,5,B0050PZ2PI,"These two films THE SONG OF SONGS, and THIS IS THE NIGHT are often compared to films by Josef Von Sternberg and Ernst Lubitsch respectively. Mostly I think, because the first stars Marlene Dietrich and the second is a romantic comedy filmed in Venice. It is also likely that the directors were instructed by Paramount to copy the styles of the more popular directors. Whether this is the case or not, both films ended up as unique and entertaining products.

  SONG OF SONGS  features a remarkable performance by Dietrich as a wide-eyed orphan on the cusp of womanhood, who meets her true love in a bohemian sculptor,(Brian Ahern); but he is unsure if he wants to marry such a naive country girl. When he turns her over to a control-freak Baron, creapily played by Lionel Atwill, she is transformed by Atwill-Pygmalion into a stylish and cultured Baroness, but her broken heart turns her cold and vindictive. Dietrich excells as both the viginal girl and the dragon lady and makes this an engrossing film. Atwill and Ahern, likewise are excellent. This does sound like a von Sternberg story and it is hard not to make comparisons. SONG OF SONGS is less visually dramatic than a Sternberg film but is also softer and more emotionally accessible. Von Sternberg inhabits a rarified environment where art is a dark and lofty goddess, but this film inhabits a more human world.

  THIS IS THE NIGHT has an odd, avante garde opening of seemingly random images and extreme camera angles in which everything is dyed blue, as in a silent film. The silent film flavor is heightened when words are replaced by sound effects. Then a woman has her dress ripped off by a car door and the whole thing resolves into a short and quirky musical number which exclaims, ""Madame has lost her dress!"". (This is the only musical number in the film.) This all leaves the viewer rather unbalanced and searching for a foothold until madame gets in the car and enters into a relatively normal conversation with her boyfreind, about her husband. After this odd opening the film becomes a Lubitsch-y romantic comedy in the vein of TROUBLE IN PARADISE. Although the similarity again, goes only so far. THIS IS THE NIGHT doesn't display the subtlty of Lubitsch, nor the playful yet skillful use of language. You do however, get playful, and rather experimental, visual flourishes throughout which hearken back to the best of the silent films and make this film an unique and very enjoyable experience.

Both of these films abound is pre-code naughtiness and should be a treat for anyone who loves 1930's cinema. Watching them made me sad for all the great films that are rotting away in their cans instead of being digitalized and released to the fans. This release is part of the TCM Vault Series, which, like the Warner Archive series, releases DVD-Rs of films that we otherwise would not get to own. Don't whine about the less durable nature of DVD-r or the lack of special features. (This set actually does have bonus features and pretty nice packaging.) Just buy them so that great, forgotten films will continue to be released. You won't be sorry.",1322697600,10,3122,4.779220779220779
