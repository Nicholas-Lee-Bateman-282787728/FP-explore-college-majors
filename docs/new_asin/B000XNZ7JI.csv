8228841,5,B000XNZ7JI,"This is a long DVD in three parts each very well done. First the history of surface naval fighting ships from sail through ""ironclads"" and steam to modern ships. Another third is the history of naval air with amazing pictures of early landings on ships to modern aircraft carriers. Thirdly, submarines from earliest ones the Turtle of our Revolutionary War and one in the Civil War, many in the World Wars, and nuclear attacks and boomers. Highly recommended.",1410480000,2,459,4.897435897435898
8228842,4,B000XNZ7JI,"This is a good set of DVDs. It is basically the updating of BBC's seminal 1970s ""Sailor"" aboard HMS Ark Royal, a name to conjure with if ever there was one. They are surprisingly parallel in their examinations of an old, decrepit girl heading out to try her hand at showing the flag, come what may, with a crew of...whatever we can get. ""Warship"" suffers from an annoying, chirpy voice-over that, allied with the editorial decisions, undermines the content. I recommend these DVDs, and hope you will have a look. This is a serious, or at least officially-approved, look at the Royal Navy in 2007-8, but from a particular point of view. And this particular point of view may damage the vista. But is the vista damaged by what the RN has truly become, or just the petty, dumb-ass decisions of the producers (with the RN's permission)? That is in your purview, dear viewer.

The Royal Navy's seriousness and professionalism has always been the goal of the US Navy, until, perhaps, the US Navy surpassed it. Perhaps because both ""Sailor"" and ""Warship"" have edited their programmes so that carriers are ""on deployment"" with ""carrier aviators"" landing on a ship for the first time in their lives, with all of the attendant failure, tends to understate the professionalism of the RN, or at least the RAF knuckle-heads they allow to land on their ships. And a lot of this may be terminology. In the US Navy, all carrier aviators undergo CarQuals, and the ship undergoes pre-deployment work-ups BEFORE they depart on cruise, so that when they pull off the pier, they are ready to do what they need to do. Perhaps in the RN the ""deployment"" begins when they leave port to start the work-ups and other readiness exercises. If so, this terminological distinction makes a crucial difference in these videos, which is that this, like ""Sailor"" before it, tends to make ""Warship"" present the RN as somewhat amateurish.

Similarly, there is the fact that these videos are made from the ""everyman"" perspective (e.g., a landlubber dumb-ass like you or me), so that most of the characters they focus on are newbies rather than professionals. This yields a certain charm, when it works correctly, although a certain contempt at the other times when it doesn't.

The net effect is that the makes the RN look amateurish. This is painful. When you compare it to USN series such as the PBS ""Carrier,"" the difference is painful and shocking. Whether you want to say that this is the ACTUAL difference between the USN and RN today, or simply the difference between how the USN and RN allow film-makers to portray them is up to you. Nonetheless, this DVD set will allow you to ask that question. It is a shame that the female sailors in ""Warship"" are, with one great exception (the engineer LCDR) a pack of quitters or too-young romantic dilettantes. Say what you will about the reason (truth or approved editing), women in USN documentaries fare better.

And here's the sad part. HMS Illustrious is an Invincible-class ""through-deck cruiser,"" or ""aircraft carrier"" or whatever terminology was accepted at a given time. She was built to host an air wing of 22 helicopters and Harriers, not the ""six Merlins"" plus whatever number of Harriers (four in this series) can be bothered to show up on their way to Afghanistan. On the one hand this a sign of the low ebb to which Her Majesty's Armed Forces have fallen, but on the other a sign of how high those same armed forces, in today's constrained economic environment, are still striving, and a credit to them. However, just a couple short years after ""Warship"" was filmed, all British Harriers were retired from service en masse, and two of the three Invincible-class carriers were retired as well, all for economic reasons. During this 30th anniversary year of the Falklands War, it is hard not to compare the 1982 operations of Invincible and Hermes, and their embarked air wings, with this lower ebb displayed in 2008. (It is worth remembering that Britain was struggling with money in 1982 as well: Invincible was to be sold, brand-new to the Australians until the Falklands invasion forced changes to those plans.) But we all do what we can, with the money available.

Bless 'em all.

Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves, Britons, never, never, never shall be involved in a coalition without the United States Navy. But the USN learned it from Britannia, and to Britannia goes all the credit.",1351900800,4,4425,4.808147174770039
8228843,5,B000XNZ7JI,"This is a wonderful introduction to the history of the warship since 1800.  They used a lot of ship museums from around the world; interviews with renowned naval historians; historic film clips; and occasionally they used some reenactment scenes.  The narration was well researched and written.  They wove a number of lesser known important facts into the story.

The first segment were about the evolution of the sailing ship into a steam powered ironclad.  This segment included the lesser known stories about the early steamship USS Demologos; the battle of Sinope, Turkey in 1853; and the use of ironclad barges in the Crimean War, 1854-55.

The second segment was about the evolution of the ironclad into the dreadnought.  This has an interesting film clip on the museum ship ironclad Huascar in Chile.  There are also discussions about the augment between the British naval designers Cowper Coles and Edward Reed.  Another section talks about the impotents of Charles Parson's yacht Turbinia.

The third segment is about the development of the Submarine.  This starts with the USS Turtle in 1776 and the CSS Hunley in 1864.  It then talks about the Whitehead torpedo and John Holland's primitive submarines.  It then talks about the effectiveness of the German u-boats in both wars. Finally there is a good discussion of the development of the nuclear submarine with the USS Nautilus and USS Albacore.

The Final Segment  is about the development of the aircraft carrier.  This starts with the early experiments of Eugene Ely in 1910.  There was much experimentation with helping a plane to safely land on a flight deck even to our modern day.  The British navy made several attempts to use seaborne aircraft to attack German Zeppelin hangers, but they were not successful until 1918.  There is a well balanced discussion of the carrier evolution from the 1920s to the Jet Age.

Overall this is a very enjoyable and educational documentary.

Anyone interested in the Battleship will also enjoy the two part documentary ""The Complete History of the Battleship"".  This excellent series has a lot of information not covered in the PBS Warship film.",1325721600,3,2186,5.1331444759206795

seen one in a great while. Anyone interested in ships
should buy this!",1311638400,,121,4.304347826086956
8228845,5,B000XNZ7JI,"Very, very good I thought. It not only goes into the well known history of warships it pulls together elements required to bring a ship to the sea; politics, science, economics, the degree a country strives to be a World Power and more. The information is facinating, the sacrifices men made to build ships inspiring, and the courage of sailors manning the ships heatbreaking. At around 4 hours total, this series flies by and the narration by actor Stacy Keech is terrific. I own a lot of PBS documentaries and I would rate this as one of the best--and you can watch it with your kids and you'll both learn something!",1283558400,3,618,4.576576576576577
