4709341,4,B005IF7HJY,"Well written and acted British sitcom. A very dysfunctional family going through well thought out story lines each episode.
Good that the same 4 main actors grew up with the show. I look on it as a diverting start to an evening's viewing.",1362700800,,238,4.558139534883721
4709342,5,B005IF7HJY,"Great price for the entire series! Hilarious show, I bought it for my sister for Christmas & asked my dad to buy a multi-regional DVD player so she could watch it.",1452211200,,163,4.290322580645161
4709343,5,B005IF7HJY,"First of all, we have an ""All-Regions"" DVD player to handle the UK DVDs.  I have been a fan of this show since it first appeared on PBS, and it's great to watch the shows again.",1440115200,,177,3.9166666666666665

4709346,5,B005IF7HJY,I love this series. It's not compatible with US regional DVD players but I have a non-regional player just so I can buy things like this that are not available in US format. We sit and laugh hysterically at the antics of this oh so dysfunctional family. If you've every seen the US series Still Standing and liked it you will like this British series as well.,1426896000,,359,4.373134328358209
4709347,5,B005IF7HJY,"Made it through Season 1 and started Season 2 last night. Wonderful show. The performances of the entire cast are a pleasure to watch. Kris Marshall as Nick is especially charming. As long as you have a Region-free DVD player, I can't recommend this series enough.",1424044800,,264,4.760869565217392
4709348,3,B005IF7HJY,"Although it's alright, if I had to live with a family like this, I would be in prison.  I would have shot them all, save Michael and Ben.  As for the Series, it is funny in some places, but the stupidity of it all, seems too much.  With the addition of the cousin, Abi, it only makes the show worse.  Susan is a Neurotic Control Freak, Janey is shallow, and Nick is so stupid, I would have aborted him had I know how he would turn out. There more I watch it, the more I hate it.  I should have saved my money.",1419724800,,509,3.9029126213592233
4709349,4,B005IF7HJY,Verry funny,1416355200,,11,5.0
4709350,5,B005IF7HJY,I was completely chuffed until the last episode. Rolf ( the paedophile ) Harris was in it. Need I say more.,1416182400,,107,4.142857142857143
4709351,5,B005IF7HJY,Nice set and quick delivery!,1412121600,,28,4.8
4709352,4,B005IF7HJY,"I LOVE the ""My Family"" series and I hope to be able to watch it ALL someday, but not with this set. I blame rough shipping on ruining this product. The physical discs were broken and parts of the disc folders were not intact. Little pieces of plastic that are supposed to hold the dvds in place were shattered. I feel so bad for the person I tried to purchase these from. I do NOT blame the seller. I blame the person(s) that treated the package like a soccer ball on its way to me. I am still waiting for the US format dvd sets to be completed. The SELLER WAS WONDERFUL and gave me a FULL refund.",1402876800,,597,4.067796610169491
4709353,5,B005IF7HJY,"I purchased this dvd set at the same time I ordered a region-free player. I had seen episodes of My Family on PBS and enjoyed it very much. Ben and Susan Harper are so good together, they really do have chemistry. The rest of the cast is also good, with some leaving the show as others are added on. I thought the price was a bit high (for me) but you really do get your money's worth, as there are 11 seasons of the show plus two dvds of Christmas episodes. I'm about halfway through watching the set now. I recommend it, but remember, in order to watch this you do need an all-regions player.",1394064000,4,594,4.173913043478261
4709354,5,B005IF7HJY,"This is the best British sitcom to hit the airwaves and although many good British sitcoms have been broadcast in the U.S. quite successfully I don't know why this one is so hard to find. As I understand it the first four seasons have been published in the U.S. as region 1 conversions, however the remaining 7 seasons cannot be found in region 1 form. I use one of my laptops hooked up to my TV to watch them - I can convert my laptop DVD drive to read region 2 DVD's, although I am restricted to 4 switches from region 1 to region 2. I think I will just keep one laptop DVD drive as region 2, the other one to standard U.S. region 1.",1389916800,6,635,4.0476190476190474
4709355,5,B005IF7HJY,My daughter was so excited when she got this for Christmas! My Family is one of the funniest shows and one of our favorite shows. We used to watch it on BBC AMERICA but they stopped airing it after the 4th season. I was very happy to find the whole series in one box set! It was my daughters most favorite gift!!,1388620800,3,312,4.048387096774194
4709356,1,B005IF7HJY,"I didn't know it couldn't be played on a dvd player in America. I gave it as a gift and couldn't even return it. Disappointing all around.

4709357,5,B005IF7HJY,"Got this and an all region dvd player for my wife's birthday.  She loves the show, but has only been able to catch random episodes on pbs.  And unfortunately last time I checked only the first season (maybe 2) were available to buy in US format.  So I figured she wouldn't expect something she didn't think she could have.  I've already double checked that the disks work in the new dvd player, and she has a week until she can enjoy.  But I see pj's, a warm blanket with a cuddly dog and some pizza in her future while enjoying a show she loves.",1379980800,4,546,4.211538461538462
4709358,5,B005IF7HJY,"My Family is one of the funniest sit-coms I've ever seen.  I saw the few few seasons on BBC-America, but they stopped airing the show.  Finding the full season was great.  I can watch the format just fine on my laptop (although i did need to install some free players to view it).",1374451200,6,280,4.245283018867925
4709359,5,B005IF7HJY,"I used to watch this show when it was on BBC America and then I bought the first four series on DVD.  I couldn't wait to see the further adventures of the Harpers but the following series never appeared, so when I saw the complete series available I ordered it immediately.  I discovered that my Mac computer will happily play these region 2 discs and I am currently enjoying them immensely.  Black's Books and My Hero are next on my agenda.  Why can't American tv produce shows this good?",1374192000,,489,4.46067415730337
4709360,5,B005IF7HJY,I love this Brit-Com and was so happy to find this boxed set. I have a Sony non-region DVD player which works great!,1367366400,,116,4.086956521739131

8474555,4,B005IF7HJY,Like this show so much I bought a region-free player in order to view seasons 5-11. It's a shame at how much content is not accessible to us in the US.,1489968000,,151,3.903225806451613

8474557,5,B005IF7HJY,"I live in the United States but saw this show once  on PBS and never forgot it. I was so happy to be able to buy the complete series here. This is a great TV show and I wish it would go on forever! I love the characters and the actors that protray them, and best of all the humor.",1474502400,,280,3.6666666666666665
8474558,5,B005IF7HJY,"Love this show to death, its too funny. I wish this box-set was for the US format. I had to buy from Amazon a regional DVD player for all zones in the DVD formats that was versatile for US standard component plugs (Samsung Multi Region Code Zone 4 PAL/NTSC DVD Player (2014 Model). I watch it all the time almost every weekend. BBC needs more family shows like this one.",1468195200,,370,4.3

8474562,5,B005IF7HJY,I have watched My Family on You Tube (no longer available) and a limited run on PBS.  I would so like to have the entire series but It is not available in US format.  Do you think in the near future it will be included in the US format.  I can watch episodes over and over and still laugh out loud.  I miss the fun.,1454716800,2,315,3.8
