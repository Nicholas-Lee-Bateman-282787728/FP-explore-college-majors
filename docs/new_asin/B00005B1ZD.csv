1420044,2,B00005B1ZD,"I like this tape series, but the DVD scans are VERY POOR quality. They are grainy and almost blurred. The quality of the VHS tapes are much better. There is no reason for this.
Save your money. Buy the tapes if you want this series. We can't support people who put out a poor quality product to save money on decent DVD scanning.",1034726400,55,329,4.238095238095238

1420058,5,B00005B1ZD,"When I found out that you have it in CDs I do not hesitate to get it.  As matter fact I have the collection on video tape cassette and one of the  cassets was damage inside the video machine. So for me was a good purchase, because of the way Mr Heston told the stories but also is useful in my church group classes.",1379376000,,315,3.90625
1420059,5,B00005B1ZD,Charlton Heston was the perfect choice in the making of this series. You are taken to various parts of the Holy land and he comments as well as reads from the bible as only he can. I am glad I bought the DVDs.,1372118400,2,209,3.883720930232558
1420060,5,B00005B1ZD,"So peaceful it put my girlfriend and myself to sleep.  LOL
Actually we both had long days at work and we were tired.
What I really like about this series is the history and pics of the Holy Land, not to mention Charlton Heston as the narrator.
I would recommend this series to everyone.
It is really great!",1366243200,5,306,4.275862068965517
1420061,5,B00005B1ZD,Love the voice of Charlton Heston.  This is the Best narration I have heard.  The presentation of the Bible is just Beautiful and he has done a fantastic job readin the Bible.  This is a must have DVD.  Showing my younger Grandkids the meaning of Faith through this DVD that is done perfect.,1344902400,2,291,4.433962264150943
1420062,5,B00005B1ZD,"Charlton Heston brings the words of the Bible to life through the natural inflections of his voice. Passages I've read have a deeper meaning as I hear the words spoken with eloquence: anger as he spoke of Jesus turning over the money changers tables, and compassion as he tells the story of Mary. He walks where Jesus walked, and one gets a feel not just for the stories, but also for the land in which they took place. Makes me want to go and see them for myself. Well done.",1303430400,,475,4.288888888888889
1420063,4,B00005B1ZD,"I am reviewing the VHS tape edition. I have not seen the DVD version but have read here that the quality is questionable.

Actor Charlton Heston, well known for playing Moses, delves into the Bible. In a combination of terrific oratory filmed in the Holy Land and classic paintings we hear readings from the King James version of the Bible. Heston is very good dramatically reading passages from the Scritures. Any Heston fan will find his majestic discourse very engaging as he speaks the lines from the most famous book on Earth. It is somewhat strange that he has a table set up at the location of ancient ruins, somewhat calling up images of John Cleese at a desk in a field on Mony Python, but it does seem to work. Heston still conveyed a great screen presence when this was filmed and he captures the essence of the Holy Books.",1272240000,8,834,4.52317880794702
1420064,5,B00005B1ZD,One of the best purchases I've made. Mr Heston is fantastic reading the scriptures and acting out Biblical events. You can tell that he had a passion for God. I would recommend this item to anyone who has an interest in the Bible.,1246320000,6,230,4.372093023255814
