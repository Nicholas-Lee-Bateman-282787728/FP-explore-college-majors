8139351,3,B000HEVZL2,"As any movie this work targets foremost own locals-and has broadened a foreign reviewer's knowledge of a region if even not so perfectly.

A street drug-seller and a good Catholic brother and son of a single mom (on terms of terrorizing a sister from communicating the young males themselves following, actually, his own sex-explorations) was caught and forcedly conscripted into the Venezuelan army, a board protection guard particularly.

As he made some usual business at a Colombian side of the boarder and deserted, a funny story of Venezuelan-Colombian affairs on a landscape of environment grounding started, a devoted Colombian soldier-enemy-turned-friend, rebels, gorillas, military, drug syndicates and sex in.

Factually, a comedy collapses into a tragedy, and a movie is rather educative than entertaining also sexism ruled.",1298592000,2,836,5.619047619047619
8139352,3,B000HEVZL2,"I bought this movie because I like Edgar Ramierez. I wasn't expecting it to be so funny. I really like the relationship between the 2 main characters. If you have a problem with subtitles I wouldn't say this is for you, but other wise see it.",1242691200,,242,4.282608695652174
8139353,4,B000HEVZL2,"Cheito is a small time street hustler who is attempting to desert from the Venezuelan army. Pedro is a simple but honorable country boy from the Colombian army. They come across one another in the jungle and end up forming an odd but close friendship before falling victim to tragic circumstances.

This is truly one of the stranger films I have ever seen. It is an odd mixture of slapstick comedy and anti-war drama with plenty of sex and violence thrown in for good measure. Cheito is a cynical city dweller who is constantly challenging the religious and patriotic values of Pedro. Then, in one of the movie's more bizzare twists, Pedro loses his virginity to Cheito's sister while Cheito sleeps with Pedro's fiancee. In the end, it's hard to say what this movie is all about except it's clear challenge to the absurdity of war.

The film was shot on an extremely low budget and the production values reflect this. But still I found it interesting, definitely more original than your typical Hollywood product. It's worth watching for those seeking something different and unique.",1186617600,4,1083,4.848648648648648
8139354,4,B000HEVZL2,"""Dot & Line,"" as ""Punto Y Raya"" is loosely translated, was a sweet surprise.  Roque Valero as Cheito is funny as the unprincipled hustler who gets drafted into the army and sent to the front where he keeps hustling everything from booze to smokes to make money.  Edgar Ramirez who capitalized on this role to also appear in ""Domino"" and the soon to be released ""Bourne Ultimatum"" does a good job as the illiterate honorable volunteer Pedro.  The smaller roles are also well done with Ramiro Meneses as the Chief Guerilla, Daniela Alvarado as Cheito's sister who sleeps with Pedro & Daniela Bascope as Lutecia, Pedro's fiancee who sleeps with Cheito.  While the production values are very low budget, looking like poorly lighted video, the script is an interesting anti-war statement.  The two armies of Colombia & Venezuela fight over a border dispute, while Pedro & Cheito have made friends and refuse to fire at each other.  The film is a strong statement that soldiers probably have far more in common than they do in opposition with their enemies.  A strong film by Elia Schneider deserves a big audience here in the United States.  Enjoy!",1176940800,3,1143,4.825641025641025
8139355,4,B000HEVZL2,"PUNTO Y RAYA ('A Dot and a Line') is a touching little film from Venezuela, a movie with low budget and high aspirations that manages to explore friendship and bonding between two warring factions in a most sensitive way.  Director Elia Schneider and writer Henry Herrera deserve their 2005 Oscar consideration for Best Foreign Film, Venezuela and we can hope this talented team partners for other outings.  Shot with a digital camera that bleeds the color to almost black and white, the production values may at first put off the audiences used to either classy black and white movies or richly colored ones, but this slight flaw should not deter the enthusiastic craftsmanship on the part of everyone involved in making this terrific little film.

The film opens and closes with battle scenes, setting the tension that exists along the river that divides Venezuela from Colombia, two countries who not only have the innate political differences but also are involved in the internationally significant war on drugs - primarily cocaine and its many derivatives.  Cheito (Roque Valero) is a young small time but smart and wily drug dealer from Caracas who is captured by the police and 'sentenced' to the Venezuelan army to patrol the border of Colombia.  He has a beautiful sister Yosmar (Daniela Alvarado) whom he protects like a watchdog.  Simultaneously  a serious, naive, conservative young Colombian named Pedro (the hunky and very fine Edgar Ramirez), 'saving himself' for his beloved girlfriend Lutecia (Daniela Bascope), volunteers for the Colombian army to combat drugs and fight the guerillas responsible for the drug trafficking along the border.

Through a continuing series of circumstances Cheito and Pedro are thrown together and it is Cheito's cunning and 'smarts' that keep the two men surviving - though at most time they are personally at odds.  Their involvement in the drug cartels they engage and the varying sides of the two armies they dodge result in some hilarious comic bits.  In their quieter moments the illiterate Pedro asks Cheito to read his letters from his Lutecia and write return correspondence - a chance for Cheito to voice his warped libidinous nature unknown to the naive Pedro.  The two young men bond, survive dangerous situations, and eventually find some quirky changes in their plans for the future.  The ending of the film is both sad and tender: by the time the story is over we have taken the two misfit buddies into our hearts.

Both Roque Valero and Edgar Ramirez are strong actors and manage to make credible this complex relationship that vacillates between enemy and comrade.  They create a chemistry on screen that makes the movie work very well indeed.  Not only is the story an entertaining one, it also gives an insight to the magnitude of the drug problems that cruelly determine lifestyles in South America.  While it never preaches, it delivers strong messages for outsiders to consider.  And in the end it is a very fine little film that deserves audience wide attention.
