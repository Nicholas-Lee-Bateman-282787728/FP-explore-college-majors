Quality varies, but that's part of the nostalgia! It's amazing that television actually caught on considering how truly AWFUL some of these shows were! But if you're ""of an age"" to remember them, you'll get a kick out of the trip down memory lane, and you'll probably appreciate today's television more (as bad as it usually is!).

In a few of the episodes, the commercials are shown as well and they're almost as entertaining as the shows!",1198281600,,825,4.843971631205674
