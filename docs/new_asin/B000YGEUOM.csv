8232643,5,B000YGEUOM,"I just love Steve Coogan. The writing and dialog on this show is so funny and original. ""I've got a wide car for my wide woman"".",1517875200,,128,3.9615384615384617
8232644,5,B000YGEUOM,"Steve Coogan is amazing in this series. The humor is multilayered and stands up to 3 and 4 times through. Ruth Jones, is as always, amazing.",1484697600,,140,4.423076923076923
8232645,5,B000YGEUOM,"Very entertaining, Steve Coogan's best character !",1461628800,,50,6.285714285714286
8232646,5,B000YGEUOM,"Even better than Coogan's ""Alan Partridge"", Saxondale had become one of my favorite characters, rather caricatures. There's so much subtle wit involved (think British Arrested Development) that you can only truly appreciate what Coogan has done here by watching it multiple times. The first character development ploy in the first scene of the first episode is a brief flash of a bumper sticker on Tommy Saxondale's yellow and black Boss Mustang that reads ""Flight 93-Let's Roll!"" Which is a delicious example of Coogan's comedic style. If you find MST3K boring, or Evil Dead dumb this show isn't for you. For those that AREN'T as deep as a puddle give this show a try! This is a strong second place, behind another underrated series- Peep Show, of British comedy over the last decade.",1451088000,,785,4.954545454545454
8232647,1,B000YGEUOM,Awful and no real reason to view it. Fooled by interesting Title.,1438646400,,65,4.5
8232648,5,B000YGEUOM,Steve Coogan is fantastic!  I can't believe he doesn't have a higher profile in America. This is in regard to the streaming version so I don't know the video quality of the disc version.,1329004800,,186,4.470588235294118
8232649,4,B000YGEUOM,"Saxondale was a bit a curates egg as TV comedy goes. One minute a moment of absolute genius from Steve Coogan but then sometimes it could leave you laughterless.

However Tommy IS a another brilliant creation from Steve Coogan. A 50something ex-roadie with a love of things 1970's, an anger management problem and a habit of speaking his mind. For me the best scenes were the openings to each episode where Tommy is shown attending anger management classes, which he continually disrupts and succeeds in upsetting other people.

Another favourite moment is when Tommy goes into a HiFi shop and debates the merits of sub-woofers etc with the shop assitant, whilst his aid Raymond is looking for evidence of pests in some form or another. After leading the shop assistant a merry dance for a number of minutes Tommy eventually leaves having bought absolutely nothing.

Of the remaining cast Rasmus Hardiker as Raymond and Ruth Jones as Magz are both good but its Morwenna Banks as the sniping Vicky who almost steals the series from Coogan. She just winds Tommy up everytime they meet.

The series is very well written, and if you seen it you'll know thats its worth buying. It improves with every viewing....",1210809600,2,1207,4.844660194174757
