2474453,5,B000CSUNTS,"I had the privilege of seeing LOLLILOVE at the 2005 Slamdance Festival in Park City, Utah.

I was surprised at how much the audience laughed during the film.  Of course, all of the free-flowing ale may have had something to do with that.

The crowd was hysterical!  The film is done in a cool home-video style that feels very real.  This is one reason that the film has such a fresh feeling to it.

Jenna Fischer and James Gunn do such a great job and are both SO funny in the film.  This was a first-time directing venture for Jenna which turned out well.  I had the privilege of being in the cast and working with Jenna, so I got to experience her directing style, firsthand.  Jenna is a very relaxed director, which allows the comedy and improv. to develop into MORE funny stuff!  I knew, at the time, that this film was a labor of love being done with a tiny budget.  So, I wasn't sure of what the final film would look like. I think everyone involved is thrilled with the outcome!

I play Kathy Rohl, a ""benefactor"" of Jenna's misguided charity work!

See LOLLILOVE, if you can!",1139616000,7,1083,4.355
2474454,5,B000CSUNTS,"This mocumentary is so well done that I found myself having an emotional reaction to it, as if it were a true documentary. Funny, filled with irony and yet socially relevant, this movie is one that everyone should see and will thoroughly enjoy.",1139356800,13,244,4.6976744186046515
2474455,5,B000CSUNTS,"Directed by and starring Jenna Fischer who most people will know from her role in the American version of The Office tv series. Her very natural acting abilities make it very easy to forget that the documentary LolliLove you are watching, is actually a skillfully scripted and directed film. Fischer wrote her directorial debut with Peter Alton and (uncredited) her real-life husband James Gunn (writer of the Scooby Doo films, Dawn of the Dead remake and Tromeo and Juliet and writer/director of Slither) . Gunn also plays her husband in the film as well, and as he has shown briefly in Tromeo & Juliet, his acting is of the same lifelike quality as Jenna's.
Lollilove is about those people who try to do the right thing by devoting themselves to a charity project for all the wrong reasons and without any genuine knowledge or understanding of the badly treated individuals in our society they try to help, and even worse so: without any interest in them apart from the opportunity to show off as a better person themselves. And the saddest thing is that they don't even know or realize this themselves.
A very dark comedy that is never too funny and sometimes gut-wrenchingly showing the mental poverty of those who are looked upon as being well off.
With this film as her debut as a film director, it should only be common sense to be confident that Jenna Fischer has a rich career ahead of her.
The feature film is done justice with a rich collection of extra's on Troma's dvd presentation that would make Criterion proud. A very informative and entertaining audio-commentary by Fisher and Gunn with Peter Alton and producer Stephen Blackeheart (100 million BCfriends, a very detailed behind the scenes documentary and a rich collection of deleted scenes and interviews with the Gunns, but also historic film introductions with James Gunn and Stephen Blackeheart from various Troma films, exclusive footage from the set of  James Gunn's Slither and much more.
Also starring Linda Cardellini (E.R., Broke Back Mountain), Jason Segel (CSI), Joan M. Blair (Donnie Darko, E.R.), Lloyd Kaufman (Terror Firmer) and many more, this is a star studded film that would have been a huge hit if it wasn't released by a blacklisted small independent film studio. Do yourself a favor and see this film. Buy it. Enjoy it.
Highly recommended!",1202169600,4,2331,4.886363636363637
2474456,4,B000CSUNTS,"Like all Office fans (American version) we pull for the Jim and Pam characters, being charmed by her reluctance, shyness and self-consciousness.  Who knew that inside Pam Beasley (actress Jenna Fischer) was the talent to pull off Lollilove, a scathingly mocumentary about well-meaning yuppies with a social conscious, no clues, and and inflated sense of self-importance.

Fischer and real-life hubby James Gunn portray a young married couple with a warped sense of charity, who decide they can help the homeless problem by giving the downtrodden lollipops, each with a specially designed piece of artwork  intended to uplift the homeless with their message.  That's right:  no shelter, no nourishment, no clothing or job opportunities, just the important concept of art's uplifting message.

In lesser hands, this would make for a decent 10 minute SNL skit.  Showing deft comedic talents, the Gunns succeed",1183334400,,906,5.382978723404255
2474457,5,B000CSUNTS,"Yes, this movie is short, only an hour long. That kind of pissed me off the first time I watched this movie. Believe me, the rest of the DVD makes up for that, as the cover boasts ""over 3 hours of extra features"", I didn't actually keep track of time watching the extras, but there is an overwhelming amount. There is a video diary from Lloyd Kaufmann (of Troma) on the set of SLiTHER (James directed/wrote this movie). There is a scene from ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"" with James and Lloyd. I might be confusing my DVDs, but I think there is the scene from ""Tromeo and Juliet"" (a movie that James wrote) that James was in (the actor that was supposed to play the part was sick that day). There is plenty of deleted scenes. There is also my favorite kind of commentaries, the kind where its a video of the people talking rather than bringing myself to watch the movie with people talking over it (although I think that is there too). I feel like there is probably more.

Anyway, if that didn't convince you to buy this movie. Here is an interesting fact: Not only are James and Jenna the nicest people in Hollywood, they are also the most talented. That is a fact, not an opinion. Buy this DVD.",1182816000,,1193,4.325892857142857
2474458,5,B000CSUNTS,"I had to laugh out loud many times as I watched Lollilove on my Video ipod while flying from New York to Denver this weekend.  My neighbor probably wondered what was so funny.  Lollilove is a great indictment on well-meaning do-gooders who have no idea how to really make a difference.  (re: liberals...).  Jenna Fischer and James Gunn pull off their roles fantastically, and seeing Linda Cardinelli as herself was a riot.  With the exception of the language (which is bleeped), Lollilove is appropriate for teens and up.  - Joel Comm, Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-AdSense-Code-What-Google-Never-Told-You-About-Making-Money-with-AdSense/dp/1933596708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The AdSense Code: What Google Never Told You About Making Money with AdSense</a>",1180915200,,818,6.527777777777778
2474459,2,B000CSUNTS,"We love Jenna Fischer's acting, but we found this quite slow and awkward, like a high-end student film. The pacing was slow and the gags just not that amusing. It was essentially one extended not-terribly-funny joke, and rather painful to watch. We couldn't make it through more than half of the movie; it just felt like an uncomfortable waste of time and money.",1179360000,2,362,4.761904761904762
2474460,3,B000CSUNTS,"I enjoyed this movie well enough, but it seemed at times like they were grasping at straws for ideas. I only laughed out loud a few times, and they were mainly at one-liners. Interesting premise, and it was executed fairly well.",1178928000,,228,4.585365853658536
2474461,5,B000CSUNTS,"Jenna Fischer is a lovely and talented lady with an awsome sense of humor that shines out in this fun independent mockumentary.  It's like watching the Jenna and James home movie show with lots of fun little bits thrown in.  Plus, its got a great message for the world, and that's always nice.  I own it and I love it.",1175212800,2,318,4.266666666666667
2474462,5,B000CSUNTS,"Wow, this movie really hits the spot. Whether you love lollipops or not, the subtle (and sometimes blatantly in-your-face) humor of this short, one hour film is is brilliant! Now I know why I love Jenna Fischer's fun character on ""The Office"" (U.S. version) and James Gunn. They sell this movie so well it'll make you want to, occasionally, hate them both enough to want to slap them across the head! Jenna Fischer and James Gunn play a married couple who want to give back to the community and all that jazz. So Fischer creates Lollilove, a charity to get the homeless back on their feet by giving each of them a lollipop. In essence, the lives of these homeless people will suddenly turn around and get back in gear because of a lollipop with Gunn's imaginative (and pretty ignorant) art on the wrappers. This movie is definitely smart, so check it out if you are looking for a good mockumentary. It follows the likes of ""The Office,"" but with the more subtle humor of ""Series 7: The Contenders,"" another subtle and smart low budget film.

The whole film has Jenna and James followed around by a camera as they are interviewed about Lollilove as well as their journey to their confident success. Written, produced, and directed by Fischer herself, you will not regret this purchase. Plus, the DVD has tons of goodies in the special features area, so you can have tons of fun even after the hilarity of the movie is over.",1174867200,2,1422,4.5984251968503935

2474464,3,B000CSUNTS,"My feelings for this film are a bit ambiguous. I really wanted to like it, and I thought there were parts that were really funny. The scenes where Jenna and James fought were terrific, such as the scene in the parking garage. Also, both of their characters reminded me of people I know, especially Jenna's. There were also things that needed work. I would have liked to see a little more character development and/or interviews with more people, such as some interviews with homeless people. I think Jenna Fischer's next film will have some of the kinks worked out.",1164585600,,565,4.717171717171717
2474465,5,B000CSUNTS,"This movie was incredibly funny.  It is a must-see for any fan of the mockumentary format.  Anyone who has ever lived in L.A. or even knows a handful of people from L.A., knows someone like this couple.  It is defintiely the kind of movie you can watch again and again.  Very cool that they were able to put it together on a limited budget -- it was a lot better than most MAJOR motion pictures.",1162512000,2,395,4.226666666666667
2474466,5,B000CSUNTS,I have never laughed so hard.  Director/Writer/Actress Jenna and Actor James Gunn are brilliantly funny.

2474467,5,B000CSUNTS,Simply the most entertaining mockumentary / film I've seen in years and one of the best ever.

2474468,5,B000CSUNTS,"Jenna Fishcer and James Gunn have such a natural chemistry with each other in Lollilove it spills over into every inch of this film.  Their improv with each other is so unrehearsed, it could only come from two people who are truly connecting while performing.

Watch the extra features on the DVD and see what a true labor of love this was for everyone involved.  You find yourself belly laughing out loud at things.  The outrageous social commentary will keep you watching to see what happens next.  They'll shock you, and they'll get inside your head.",1154044800,4,553,4.71875
2474469,4,B000CSUNTS,"Jenna Fischer of NBC'S The Office unleashes a Troma-distributed mockumentary about a wealthy couple ( Fischer and Gunn ) who decide to help the homeless. How, you may ask? By giving them money? Providing housing? Working in a soup kitchen? No. Handing out suckers.  Armed with inspirational phrases, these lollipops are distributed to the homeless.  What follows is a mockumentary that skewers the lengths people go to for notoriety, and the seemingly well-intentioned, yet narcissistic nature of a couple who see the world through different lenses.  The charity becomes a production to them, with a television crew and celebrity endorsements gleaming in their eyes, as they view social causes casually, aiming to find the ""perfect charity"" to bestow their generosity upon..  In doing so, they fail to spot the problems in their own marriage and lives.",1153440000,2,852,5.242647058823529
2474470,1,B000CSUNTS,"I am a big fan of the Office, and of the mockumentaries mentioned, and of just good old regular documentaries, which are often funny unintentionally.

I thought there were a few bright moments in this otherwise strained mockumentary. But not nearly enough to make it worth watching.

I just didn't like it at all. Although I must say it mocked everything bad about today's affluent yuppie culture.  For my money I'll take the utterly horrid couple in Best in Show  - the Lawyers with Braces!  on My Mac, at Starbucks!  It was sooo good.  (Best in Show)

Lolli-love was not.",1152662400,5,573,4.66
2474471,5,B000CSUNTS,"Going into viewing LolliLove, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I admit that I had some concerns that the positive reviews were just coming from fans of The Office who weren't being very objective. But that fear was quickly laid to rest -- this is a very clever and funny film, and I can honestly say that I would enjoy it just as much if I'd never heard of any of the actors. It's very well written (or written/improvised), and the actors do a great job of seeming completely sincere while saying ridiculous things.

Lollilove is definitely a low-budget production, and it shows in some ways. The sound isn't great in some scenes, and the video quality isn't up to what you may be used to seeing in major studio DVDs (shot on film). But that really ended up adding to my enjoyment of the film, rather than detracting from it. This really feels like a documentary, rather than a studio movie posing as a documentary.

The thing that amazes me most about LolliLove is how much talent it really shows. It's easy to look at big budget Hollywood films and think, ""I could do that if I had millions of dollars to work with."" But LolliLove was made with almost no money, almost no equipment and a relatively inexperienced cast and crew. I look at LolliLove and I can't fool myself into thinking I could have made it -- the only things they had that I don't are amazing creativity and talent.

I think LolliLove is worth checking out not just for fans of Jenna Fischer or James Gunn, but for anyone who likes the mockumentary style of comedy.",1152403200,25,1537,4.462633451957295
2474472,4,B000CSUNTS,"Director/co-writer/star Jenna Fischer may be the on the recieving end of Steve Carell's self-important antics in ""The Office"" but in ""Lollilove"" she plays a role akin to Carell's egocentric boss on that show/ The mockumentary goes after those who think of giving to charity (individuals and companies) as a way to gain attention, as well as mocking the marriage between Jenna and James Gunn (her real-life husband, hilariously playing a germ-phobe who has problems being near homeless people). Since this real life couple play a spoof of themselves one might fear that the film would cave in on itself and lose its edge if the film seemed far too ""inside"" and come off as its own exercise of attention to its stars. Luckily the film is tightly wound around its premise and nuances of the couple (they're quibles are at times very rich and hilarious) that you feel settled into watching realized characters rather than real people playing characters. A great comedy that deserves to become a cult hit. Definately worth seeking out!",1144108800,2,1030,4.959537572254336
2474473,5,B000CSUNTS,"The best mockumentaries are the ones so deadpan, so serious, that you almost feel uncomfortable while watching it because the situations seem so believable and awkward.  That's always the problem with Christopher Guest's films like The Mighty Wind and Waiting for Guffman - they're just absurd enough that you can laugh merrily.

Jenna Fischer and James Gunn did an outstanding job making this a darkly humorous, painful to watch, hilarious documentary.  As a fan of Jenna's character Pam on The Office, and after reading an interview with her and finding her to be as funny and sarcastic as her character, I was intrigued when I heard about Lollilove.  And I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Anyone who is a fan of black humor and deadpan comedy should give this a shot.",1143417600,7,762,4.875968992248062
2474474,5,B000CSUNTS,"This Mockumentary is written, directed and stars Jenna Fischer.  Where do you know Jenna from?  Why, The Office!  I admit I viewed this DVD because I love Jenna on The Office and Lollilove did not disappoint at all.  It is similar in the mockumentary sense, but also very different.  It is hilariously done and Jenna & her husband, James Gunn, are spot on. There are also great cameos from Linda Cardellini and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks.

The context of the mockumentary is a couple who wants to start a charity but the couple (Jenna and James) are somewhat shallow and self-centered.  The idea they come up with involves handing out lollipops with uplifting mesages to the homeless and of course being self-serving by featuring James artwork.",1142467200,7,751,4.8203125
8102248,2,B000CSUNTS,"I gave it half an hour to see where it would go with the preposterous idea of lollipops for the homeless. The humor in this mockumentary is of one kind only: well to do people who have no idea what the needs of the very poor are, and whose concern is mostly to promote themselves. (Especially true of the man the artist.) I was increasingly both annoyed and bored. So, I quit. 1 1/2 stars",1475539200,,388,4.1866666666666665
8102249,5,B000CSUNTS,"I thought this was one of the very best Troma films I have ever seen. They have an amazing cast, and starring as one of the main character's, Jenna Fischer, really propels this film. An other cast member in the film who is a personal favorite of mine Judy Greer. Now this is not to mention an appearance by Jason Segel.

The movie is shot in a mocumentary style. The content of the film is completely nudity free which is something different from a Troma movie, yet the jokes made in the film hold nothing back from 9/11, Gays, The Homeless, Jesus, racism and many more possible hot topic buttons issues. I was blown away to hear Jenna Fischer say some of these things on film from knowing her being a bigger time T.V. and now Film Star. I would chalk it up to the first time you ever heard say a Drew Carey or Chris Rock stand up compared to their T.V. persona. Hearing them spew out obscenity's at every turn.

I felt this was a breath of fresh air for Troma and I hope there are other gem's in the Troma catalogue like this for me to discover. To touch back quickly on the jokes, there nothing shocking if you know Troma movies and actually nothing shocking more than you will hear at any turn on the internet but I believe from only knowing Jenna Fischer as this cute girl from the T.V. show the Office I was a little surprised to see her in this type of role. As for Judy Greer she played a solid role as always and looked amazing as always with or with out her dyed red hair color.

To wrap this up this movie isn't your typical Troma Team Production. There is no gore, or nudity, and its written as a mocumentary with some narrating in parts. If your only into the whole costumes, blood and guts, and/or nudity from Troma films then I wouldn't bother with Lollilove.

Simplified and streamlined sum of the plot-
A young married couple, well off financially, decide to make a list, including some of them written in a very demeaning way, of causes they can give back to as charity. They decide on giving back to the homeless in a manner of giving them lollipops with artwork hand drawn on the lollipop wrapper by the husband of the duo with demeaning homeless looking characters or racist characters with a positive slogan. Funds are needed to support there cause and this is were Jason Segel comes into play with his girlfriend at a dinner and is offered to support the cause by a small $200,000 donation. Denied the couple set up a pitch with prototype to a funder and succeed. Needing help in production Judy Greer and others step in to help out the duo and also help distribute the lollipops to homeless as a news T.V. anchor will film them distributing them out. The whole charity becomes a failure caused by not only the couple's internal fighting, but with a homeless actor threatening to rape Jenna Fischer, which then restores the love in the couples marriage that was beginning to unravel. Finally returning to their normal lives and briefly looking back on the positive (in there own minds) impact they have made through there brief charity work the duo lives out there now happy marriage with stronger bond than ever before.",1446076800,,3142,4.459130434782609

I have known actual people who think and behave almost exactly like the characters Jenna Fischer and James Gunn portray, and since I have a huge thing against people who do charity for the wrong reasons, this film (and it's spot-on dialogue and plot) totally resonated with me.

It's funny how much of her sense of humor seems to translate to The Office (of which she currently plays Pam Beesley). It's subtle and funny and hilariously absurd. The movie is about a rich yuppie couple who decide to ""give back"" and make their mark by becoming philanthropists, helping the homeless by giving them lollipops wrapped in James' ""art."" Of course being selfish, deluded, idiots, Jenna and James (they use their real names as their character's names) end up fighting and growing apart over various problems with their bizarre idea.
