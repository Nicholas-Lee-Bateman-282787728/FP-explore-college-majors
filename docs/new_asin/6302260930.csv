442588,3,6302260930,"1992 Royal Rumble

January 19, 1992

Knickerboxer Arena

Albany, New York

New Foundation V. Orient Express

Good opener that got the crowd into it. The New Foundation win. ***1/4

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

The Mountie (Champion) V. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper

ok match that saw Piper winning his olny WWF Gold. WOW. Thats weird to think about. *3/4

Bushwaackers V. Beverly Brothers

13 minutes and 57 second of boringness and than 3 second of it's about time as the wackers win. DUD those 3 second were the 3 count.

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Legion Of Doom (Champions) V. Natural Disaters

boring match that had the Doom getting countedout for no reason. *1/2

Royal Rumble Match for the WWF Championship:

God, I love Pat Patterson...wait...i don't mean sexually...i mean...well, you know what I mean. Excellent booking and finally, someone who is not Hogan wins. Ric Flair enters number 3 and wins the Rumble and the WWF Championship! Yes...Yes! four words...BEST RUMBLE MATCH EVER. *****

Overall, a forgetable show except the rumble match which is the best rumble ever.",1138924800,,1081,5.091428571428572
442589,2,6302260930,"This PPV was bad.  The vacant World Title was decided in the Royal Rumble match.  The undercard was horrible.

The Mountie vs. Roddy Piper for the IC Title.  This was a boring match but the only good thing about it is that Roddy Piper finally wins a title. (2/5)

Legion of Doom vs. Natural Disater for the World Tag Team Titles.  This match was utter garbage.  The Legion of Doom should have faced somebody better.  The Natural Disaters take a win by countout. (1/5)

New Foundation vs. Orient Express was the best match opf the night so far and that's not saying much but still it was very good.  The New Foundation picks up the win. (3.5/5)

Beverly Brothers vs. The Bushwhackers was as boring as boring gets and I literally almost fell asleep.  The Beverly Brothers win and I don't care. (0/5)

Royal Rumble Match for the World Title.  Everybody says this was the greatest Rumble ever nope that goes to 2004 believe it or not.  Flair wins the Rumble and he is the new World Champion. (2.5/5)

Overall this PPV is very boring and it will not entertain you so just don't even rent this garbage.",1103846400,,1096,4.459595959595959
442590,4,6302260930,"This WWF Royal Rumble took place in Albany, New York, in January of 1992 where, for the first time, this year's winner would lay claim to the vacant WWF World Championship. Also, among the other four matches on the card, the Mountie defended the WWF Intercontinental Title vs. Roddy Piper and the Road Warriors put the WWF Tag Team Championship up against the Natural Disasters. In all, the rumble alone gave WWF fans their absolute money's worth.

1. New Foundation (Jim Neidhart & Owen Hart) vs. the Orient Express: 3 stars ..... In a slightly above-average match, the Hart boys (despite their gaudy costumes) display some solid in-ring chemistry together as they manage to deep-six the Express.

2. Roddy Piper vs. I-C Champion The Mountie: 3 stars ...... After a flashback to Bret Hart's recent title loss, Piper easily blows past the Mountie and Jimmy Hart to win his first and only WWF gold. While the match is relatively decent, it is also heavily pushed that Piper will be the first-ever competitor to have a chance at winning the I-C and World Titles on the same night.

3. Bushwhackers (with a geek) vs. the Beverly Brothers (with Lanny Poffo): A total zero ...... Watching a blank screen for 15 minutes is far more rewarding than forcing yourself to sit through this awful match. It is recommended that you immediately hit your fast-forward button when this one comes across your tv screen.

4. WWF World Tag Team Champions: The Road Warriors (aka the Legion of Doom) vs. the Natural Disasters: 2 stars .... Not even the Warriors are able to drag much excitement out of this routine match with such inferior competition (when the Nasty Boys or the Powers of Pain could have been available). The dismal Disasters take the win with a dubious count-out and feel cheated afterwards. You should, too.

5. The Royal Rumble participants: Hulk Hogan, Sid Vicious, Ric Flair, new I-C Champion Roddy Piper, the Undertaker, Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Kerry von Erich, the British Bulldog, Hercules, the Warlord, Shawn Michaels, Tito Santana, Mike Rotundo, Ted DiBiase, Big Bossman, Sgt. Slaughter, Nikolai Volkoff, Jimmy Snuka, Greg Valentine, Rick Martel, Repo Man, the Nasty Boys, Hacksaw Duggan, Haku, the Barbarian, the Berzerker, Virgil, and Skinner.

5 stars ...... Just about every major WWF star of the time (minus Bret Hart & the Road Warriors) makes an appearance sometime during the match. The in-ring chemistry among the wrestlers is outstanding from beginning to finish, especially Flair's willingness to take almost everyone's best shots during his hour-long stay in the rumble. In the end, it comes down to the four men who would headline the double main event at Wrestlemania VIII a few months later.

As a side note, announcer Bobby Heenan's ringside commentary, which alternates between hyperventilating and flagrant cheering for Flair, is really amusing. The drawback is: the announcers end up so heavily hinting at who the eventual winner will be that it becomes a foregone conclusion.

If you are able to find this vhs for a reasonable price, it is well worth the investment to see some of the best WWF players ever assembled in one match for the most valuable prize in pro wrestling.",1099526400,4,3206,4.946096654275093
442591,4,6302260930,"Back when the WWF still understood the significance of the Royal Rumble event. The once classic hour-long battle royal really hasn't been much since the emergence of the ""Attitude"" era but in 1992, it wasn't just about which big-name stars could clear the ring of all the mid-carders. To those who aren't familiar with the pre-Austin WWF, this is a must-see.
Ric Flair gave an ""Ironman"" performance here. The commentary was on point here as well as Bobby Heenan's blatantly-biased broadcasting made for some amusing moments as he and Gorilla Monsoon trade shots back and forth. This was long before there was so much emphasis on commentators spending the whole show talking about one or two big main event wrestlers until they arrive in the Rumble. Clearly, Hulk Hogan is the big favorite here but the broadcasters take the time to acknowledge other feuds and storylines such as the one between the Macho Man and Jake Roberts and so on. This was one of the last great classic Rumbles before the WWF started going the predictable route. This was also the first and only Royal Rumble where the winner would get the WWF Title, a strange stipulation though it made it that much more intruiging, and the last one before they began rewarding the winner with a shot at the WWF Title at Wrestlemania.
The undercard for the '92 ""Rumble"" was not one of the better ones though Roddy Piper's only title win is a plus. He comes in as a substitute for Bret Hart, who is out due to illness, to challenge The Mountie for the Intercontinetal Title. There are also two tag team matches, one of which features the short-lived ""New Foundation"", a tag team featuring Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart.
If you can find Royal Rumble 1992 at any video store, I recommend that you pick it up.",1062460800,5,1760,4.662379421221865
442592,4,6302260930,"Possibly the greatest Royal Rumble match produced to date, the 1992 edition is at least the most star studded.  The list of former and future World Champions in this event is enormous.  Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage in his last significant run in the WWF, Hulk Hogan, also  in his last significant run in the company before his 2002 return, Sid Justice, ""The Heartbreak Kid"" Shawn Michaels, ""The Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich in his last major wrestling PPV appearance before his death, The Undertaker, all these performers were significant World Champions in the 80's and or 90's, some of them (Hogan, Savage) in both decades.  Of course, the star of the show is Ric Flair, who lasts over 62 minutes (wrestlers draw numbers and enter the ring in 2 minute intervals, the match itself is fought like an over the top rope battle royal) to win the event and become the WWF World Champion, making him the only wrestler ever to be recognized as World Champ by the NWA, WCW, and WWF.  Other notable main event stars include ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, Tito Santana, ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, and The British Bulldog.  Flair takes an incredible amount of punishment and is exhausted at the end. A true classic match up.  The rest of the card is ordinary at best.",1054857600,,1307,4.7312775330396475
442593,4,6302260930,"The Man made his first appearance here.  That is all ye need know.
We start with the New Foundation vs. Orient Express - The New Foundation was OWEN HART~ and Jim Neidhart.  The Orient Express used to be a good tag team by the name of Bad Company.  Neither of them are from the Orient.  This is a very solid match with Owen showcasing his stuff.  That's always good to see.***3/4
IC Title - The Mountie vs. Roddy Piper - Not a good match by any means, but Piper was so popular at the time it was nice to see him get his first (only?) title.  The Mountie fluked into the title when Bret Hart got injured days before.* match **** nostalgia.
Beverly Bros. vs. Bushwhackers - Ecch!  Fast forward.
Royal Rumble - The title was held up a month before so this is for the WWF Title.  Undertaker and Hogan were given ""preferential treatment"" since they were feuding over the title.  Ric Flair made his debut a few months earlier with the NWA Title in tow.  He claimed to be the REAL champion.  Bobby Heenan became his manager and Mr. Perfect was the executive consultant.  Heenan is announcing tonight and is hilarious in his blatant cheering for Flair (who draws #3 btw).  This is an absolutely awesome performance by the best in the business.  The Rumble Match is the only real reason to buy this.  It is the best rumble ever and one of the best matches the WWF has ever produced.  Period.  The Foundation/Orient Express is serviceable, but not really worth going out of your way to find.
Hopefully, the WWF comes to its senses and releases the previous Royal Rumbles much like they did with Wrestlemania in 1999.
Great match, but not really worth the ""rental only"" price.",1020816000,,1665,4.4784053156146175
7823024,4,6302260930,The beginning match is kinda messed up as far as the tape quality but it's the Piper/Mountie match and already have it on DVDs. Other then that everything is up to par.,1360195200,,168,4.28125
7823025,1,6302260930,The only good/memorable match in the vhs is the 40 man battle royal. The rest are pathetically forgettable. The cowboy movie vignettes with Bobby Heenan & Gorilla Monsoon are very funny but fail to save this mess of a tape. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.,1352073600,,255,4.224489795918367

It was also the first & only Royal Rumble to have the WWF(WWE)world title on the line. The rest were pretty forgettable. I give this PPV a 8 and a half out of 10.,1279411200,,341,4.104477611940299
7823028,4,6302260930,"While many wrestling fans and writers state the 1992 Royal Rumble was the greatest Rumble ever, I can agree but the undercard was beyond horrible.
Monsoon and Heenan are on there game here and make the whole event enjoyable despite some bad matches.

Jim Neidhart and Owen Hart VS the Orient Express in the first of the trio of horrific tag team matches. Hart is very green in this match and does an alright job but this match still sucked.

Roddy Piper VS Mountie: It was suppose to be Bret Hart, but he was sick and lost to The Mountie a few days earlier. I'd rather see Hart but this match was short and enjoyable.

Bushwackers (with Jamison) VS Beverly Brothers (with Genius): This is by far the worst match i've ever seen on a PPV. With all the talent WWF had at the time they could have picked a much better match.

The Road Warriors VS Natural Diseasters: I couldn't wait for this match and it was the final in the horrific trio of tag matches. The ending sucked and Hawk delivered one of the worst chair shots in the history of wrestling. Animal made up for it as Hawk whipped Earthquake into Animal, who hit him with a great chair shot.

The Rumble: I enjoyed the Rumble but it was far from my favorite of all time. If you listen thru out the entire PPV you know Flair is going win the world title.

Overall, the Rumble is only saved due to the main event. The trio of tag matches were atrocious and Mountie-Piper was short but enjoyable. The commentating was excellent thru out the event.",1232323200,,1498,4.370503597122302
7823029,5,6302260930,"Many people criticize this Royal Rumble because of the main focus of the event being on Ric Flair's performance in the Rumble Match. But it truly was/is a tremendous event. Really, the only way you are going to get anything out of this particular review is if you are a die-hard fan of this era in the World Wrestling Federation. In my opinion, this is one of the top two greatest Royal Rumbles of all time (right behind 1995.)One of the reasons is the uniqueness of the Rumble match. The stipulation was that whoever won the match won the vacant WWF Championship. It would be a year later that the company would include the stipulation that whoever won got a main event title shot at WrestleMania. If you followed the WWF in the early 90's, you are probably aware of how different an attitude the company had then. It was really a time when you either had to get wrapped in a particular storyline, or you just didn't get it. This Rumble was all about building Ric Flair as a WWF guy, but that is where the company needed to go since Flair had been the face of NWA/WCW for so long. Some of my personal highlights from this event include the commentary of Bobby ""the Brain"" Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon as relates to whether or not Flair could go the distance. Heenan is so excited and nervous every time Flair is close to elimination that you just have to laugh and admire Heenan's ability to be the best heel commentator in the business. The New Foundation and The Orient Express have a phenominal tag team match and do a great job of kicking things off at the event. Roddy Piper gives a hilarious interview about The Mountie, and there is so much more. Buy this event from Amazon. It is awesome. I give it five stars and a whole lot more.",1188691200,,1738,4.400621118012422
7823030,4,6302260930,"This was one of the strangest ppv's in history!  The undercard was alright at the very best. The whole focus of the event was the Royal Rumble match. I am going to tell u the contreversy behind the Rumble starting with Survivor Series 91

Undertaker fought hogan and beat him with the help of  whooooooo

Ric Flair.  This lead to a rematch a week later where Hogan defeated the Undertaker by cheating.  That made the title vacant and then at the Rumble the title would be won by the winner of the 30 man battle royal.

So at the Rumble Flair lasted a while throwing a few people out

Undertaker threw out around 3 people also.

Hogan threw out taker and a few others

flair eliminated Pshyco Sid last and hogan to win the title!

Simply the best Rumble match ever! and the biggest build up!

This is a classic so buy it for $13 before it goes for $40- $50.

Buy this video!",1152662400,,873,4.25
