8621551,1,B001L4B14S,"I wouldn't recomend this DVD to anyone. I bought this in preparation for getting a Vizsla puppy, and I was expecting more in depth information about the breed. The narrator held one Vizsla puppy through the entire DVD, and there was a second actor that dressed like a vetrinarian to provide health information about the breed. The narrator often paused awkwardly as if he was reading from a script and did not seem knowledgeable about this breed of dog at all. I was also expecting to see some adult Vizslas, and there was only one Vizsla puppy shown in the entire DVD. The dog in the puppy training bonus appeared to be a Border Collie. The DVD reminded me of a high school project, and did not seem professional. I'm going to have to look elsewhere for more information about this breed. I think that there is better information available for free elsewhere (youtube, the library). I wouldn't purchase again.",1397520000,,910,4.69375
