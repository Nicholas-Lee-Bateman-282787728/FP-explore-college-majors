I have come to love Daniel Boone series circa 1965. As a teen I watched Daniel Boone but as an adult I had forgotten about it until my wife gave me one of the (6) six seasons. Immediately I fell in love witht the series even more so than as a teen. Subsequently, I have purchased the other (5) seasons and I am in the middle of season (4) four as I write this review. I love the ""Mingo"" seasons and as Fess Parker stated in the bonus parts of the CDs he was sorry that Ed Ames couln't have finished the balance of the series becuase of his singing career. What an awesome actor and singer Ed Ames is. All of the season's thus far keep improving in story lines. I suggest that you try seasons (1 and 2)amd you too will come to fall in love with the Daniel Boone TV series. Considering how poor most of TV is today this series is great.",1301356800,,969,4.052083333333333
8297306,5,B001EAPI5M,"These stories are hours and hours of good old-fashioned entertainment. They are very family oriented and brings back memories of what television used to be. These have the orginal cast: Fess Parker, Patricia Blair, Ed Ames. If you are a child of the fifties you will probably recognize quite a few of the popular guest stars that appear in the series.

Season one (1964-65) is 28 episodes of very nicely restored black and white and includes special features, one of which is the 2006 cast reunion photos and interviews with the cast. Season two (1965-66) is 29 episodes in color and also includes more special features. In my opinion, these DVDs are great entertainment value for the money.",1264032000,5,691,4.8559322033898304
