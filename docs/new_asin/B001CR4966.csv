3517075,5,B001CR4966,"After 1945, Joel McCrea, like his friend and contemporary ""cowboy"" Randy Scott, acted almost exclusively in Westerns. Several of those he made for Universal stand out---CATTLE DRIVE, SADDlE TRAMP, and BORDER RIVER, in particular. But he also made THE OUTRIDERS (MGM), WICHITA (Allied Artists), and several others of very good quality [let's hope these get released on silver disc soon!]. STRANGER ON HORSEBACK is one of McCrea's best, perhaps his best outing between CATTLE DRIVE and RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY. His taciturn but entirely engaging manner is on full display. Add to this good casting of John McIntyre, Kevin McCarthy, and others, and you have the makings of a fine oater. Thanks to VCI for releasing this little gem!  Let's hope more McCrea will follow...what about it Universal? And WICHITA certainly merits release, as well.",1218758400,33,836,5.192592592592592

3517098,3,B001CR4966,"Since I'm a Louis L'Amour junkie, any book [he] writes that is converted to film, I want for my collection. Always liked Joel McCrea's acting, but when you have seen Louis L'Amour films starring Tom Selleck or Sam Elliott as the main characters, this film pales. I took into consideration the year it was made plus how the writers of that time interpreted the book for the screen. As compared to the realism of what the west and cowboys were really like as portrayed in films with Selleck and Elliot - dirty streets, dirty cowboys and rugged attitutes and action, I was a  bit bored by the lack of realism in the film. It was a bit mild mannered and pristine. If you're a Joel McCrea fan, you'll at least like watching the film because he's the hero.",1393632000,2,750,4.434782608695652
3517099,5,B001CR4966,A wonderful western.  Love Joe McCrae.  A well done film and the picture is very clear - wonderful!!!  Great -,1393286400,,110,4.4
3517100,4,B001CR4966,"Off-beat ""B"" western. Adult, or rather a mature and smart story not of white hats vs black hats, but of the frontier coming to terms with civilization. A good company of actors supporting Joel McCrea. Shot on location, it has a far more expansive visual style (in color) than most ""B"" westerns. If you are a Western fan, it should be seen.",1393027200,2,339,4.483870967741935
3517111,3,B001CR4966,"I find that it is a good western with a tough guy with a soft heart. It is like a-lot of westerns of the time making it predictable. I also find that the actor is okay with one liners and the manufacturing is ""okay"". But I would still put it in a ""B"" category and good to have it in a collection to view again!",1389916800,2,310,3.7846153846153845
3517112,3,B001CR4966,"Joel McCrey is always the same on  screen and if the script is as good as the director you will enjoy it. This one is not his best, but the movie is entertaining.",1368057600,2,162,3.909090909090909
3517113,5,B001CR4966,"Joel McCrea is made for this role being a rancher & cowboy.  His kick back way that he has about him. As I've repeatably said Joel McCrea was made to play westerns.  He can ride, act, & his good looks & build is in his favor. I think that the writer Louise L'Amour sometimes gets carried away with his pen or something but Joel does great with what material he has & makes the movie top notch",1334188800,2,392,4.077922077922078
3517114,5,B001CR4966,"Joel McCrea could do this stuff in his sleep but always manages to bring a sense of conviction and sincerity to his Western characterizations. McCrea's judge Thorne is a mature, level-headed man up against impossible odds yet goes about his job as though it were daily routine. One could see why McCrea wanted Jacques Tourneur to direct as his character is similar to the one he played in Tourneur's STARS IN MY CROWN, a man of deep convictions who straps on his guns only when there is no other way.

Surprisingly, this film actually has the feel of an early Spaghetti Western, in that our hero faces several situations in which he is vastly out-numbered (as in DJANGO) yet easily deals with the situation. The photography and locales (Sedona) greatly enhance the experience. As for odd touches, I personally like the wide-angle shot in the marshal's office with the cat just off to the right cleaning itself while important dialogue is being discussed...you're focused on the cat until you realise that you'd better pay attention here.

It seems that Tom Bannerman (well played by Kevin McCarthy) has shot and killed an innocent man who objected to Tom molesting his wife. The Bannermans run the whole valley (much like the Barkleys, only they're not as nice) and Josiah Bannerman (another great John McIntire performance) doesn't want his only son standing trial for murder and he sets his minions against McCrea's Thorne, a man committed to uphold the law and bring Tom to trial at all costs. This plays like RIO BRAVO before RIO BRAVO, with touches of GUNMAN'S WALK and Burt Lancaster's later (1970's) LAWMAN thrown in.

Emile Meyer also gives an excellent performance as the Town Marshal who sides with McCrea. It's a nicely played low-keyed role of a  complex character on the fringe of things. And Miroslava just overflows with sexuality in a striking (OUCH!) performance. I had never heard of her and sadly the extras on the dvd tell of her committing suicide shortly after making this film.

I won't give it away, but the final confrontation is no less than outstanding. A superior Western all around, a classic example of quality 1950's Western fare, a keeper to your dvd library. The color process was a cheap Technicolor substitute (Anscocolor) but the restoration has brought us a vivid, quality presentation with many scenes looking just fantastic. It's mostly the night scenes that don't fare as well, the fault of the Ansco process, not the restoration. So for those of you who are going to nit-pick about Technicolor imperfections, just be glad that this rarely seen (almost lost forever) and important McCrea Western is now available for us to enjoy. And it's a good one, one of Joel's best, maybe a belt notch below FOUR FACES WEST and RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, but that alone is praise enough.",1333411200,3,2811,4.860125260960334

3517116,4,B001CR4966,"STRANGER ON HORSEBACK is the least known of Jacques Tourneur's westerns, which include two other Joel McCrea vehicles, WICHITA and STARS IN MY CROWN (not really a western in my view, but widely regarded as such), and the justly celebrated CANYON PASSAGE. The tightly-constructed story involves a circuit-riding judge with high standards of personal and public behavior faced with some difficult decision-making when he runs up against the renegade son of a too-powerful rancher. This is one of the best examples of the way Tourneur uses windows and doors as referents for different planes of vision and passages between diverse systems of moral value. This disk appears to have been reproduced from a television broadcast, and isn't as pretty as the film deserves, but for now it's all we've got and we're sure lucky to have it.",1313020800,9,828,5.0510948905109485
3517117,2,B001CR4966,"The most impressive thing about this movie is the location work around Sedona, Arizona.  Sadly, the poor quality of the print and lackluster DVD transfer do a serious injustice to the photography, and I therefore can't recommend it.  Several seconds are missing at a critical moment, and that's distracting too.  The story -- which other reviews describe in more detail -- is fairly standard; if you're a fan of westerns, you've seen it many times with many variations: the good guy has to bring a bad guy to trial against overwhelming odds.  There are a few good scenes in the first half, and watching John Carradine as an overblown windbag is a pleasure.  The other bad guys are one-note cliches, but the biggest problem is the miscasting of the Czech born Miroslava as the female lead.  I've never read the original Louis L'Amour story, but it seems pretty clear that she was supposed to be the daughter of the wealthy rancher.  However, her accent made that impossible, so she's now his niece.  It still isn't believable.  McCrea is a bit stiff and 20 years older than she is, so the love story doesn't work very well.  It's not a terrible film, and at 65 minutes, it doesn't lag.  But your time is better spend watching a great western a second time instead of watching this one at all.",1273017600,2,1291,4.618421052631579
3517118,5,B001CR4966,"We are Louis L'amour fans and this is classic Louis L'amour, with the usual twists and turns and a surprise ending.",1262131200,,115,4.523809523809524
3517119,3,B001CR4966,"Admittedly, I am not a Joel McCrea fan by any means.  I do snap up any films based on stories from Louie Lamour and this film was classic Lamour.  Joel McCrea did a good job with his character and that says a lot when you consider that I have never been a fan of this particular actor.  John Carradine was fantastic as always and much younger in this film.

The quality of this DVD was poor.  The original film negative was lost at some point in time and this DVD was produced off a copy of a film that survived.  Dispite being ""remastered"" there are fluctuations in color and film quality from scene to scene with a heavy emphasis on the red hues which I found to be distracting.",1231286400,,680,4.232558139534884

8288877,5,B001CR4966,"Joel McCrea is an actor who proved to portray the good old west with upstanding & GOD fearing values. Values that allow us to take necessary steps to stop someone from hurting or even killing us &/or our families. This movie presents such a different way we once lived. Justice unfortunately does not always prevail but in the movie land kingdom, I believe, it should. We don't, or should I say I & my family don't go to the movies to see more of the disgusting injustice we now have. Going to the movies used to be a kind of getting away for as brief a moment in time as it could. Where right wins out over evil. I won't disappoint & tell how this movie ends as you might be surprised, especially the way I have just expressed my beliefs. All in all, however the ending, you will see superb acting with a great & simple story line. Yes, I Highly recommend Joel McCrea movies, such as this one.",1444608000,3,894,4.264705882352941
