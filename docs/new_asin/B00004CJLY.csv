Just wish I could get it in Blu Ray, or even DVD.",1294099200,6,107,4.095238095238095
7920379,1,B00004CJLY,"Very, very disappointed.  I only wanted to get this DVD because my husband was in the movie.  It didn't show the part that he was in and it didn't show the dedication to the unit that was in the movie.  My husband said the original version had everything because the unit viewed the movie.  Guess they had to take out something giving credit to an army unit.",1273449600,3,358,4.298507462686567
7920380,3,B00004CJLY,It's a pretty good movie. I've seen it a few times and I still like it. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. The general in the movie shows us just how arrogant some of our military leaders can be.,1178928000,7,200,3.7857142857142856
7920381,1,B00004CJLY,this is one of the worst war movies i have ever seen. how can you make a war movie that has little fights in it and not one person in the movie that you can like. this one felt like it went on forever. skip it.,1148342400,,210,3.5869565217391304
