3704363,2,B001MZVZGA,"The listing at Amazon says not available until March 30, 2009 but it is on sale at Costco now (March 2, 2009). I purchased a set because it was my favorite Western growing up. This DVD set includes just the colorized episodes.
I found the DVD's to be either poorly made or all 3 were damaged somehow because they played poorly and there were mismatched video throughout with the audio. Too bad for the stories themselves were just as good as they were when I was growing up.",1236124800,19,474,4.3977272727272725

3704365,3,B001MZVZGA,"Laramie was my all-time favorite tv western series - and I watched them all!  If you just want to have an archival copy, this is currently your only choice.  Beware:  the quality of the dvd is absolutely terrible!  Images are blurred and sometimes unstable.  Color is washed out.  If you get GRIT tv, their episodes are just like new!",1493251200,2,334,4.576271186440678
3704366,1,B001MZVZGA,"This is the worst quality DVD copy I have ever purchased! To start, the color is so far from the original that it's hard to tell what you're looking at. Second, the sound is so completely off from the picture on disc 4 that the entire disc is a complete waste and can't be watched. Third, all of the discs are grainy as though you are watching a VHS tape that has been taped over 100 times...and these are DVD'S!!! Finally, some of the episodes are so off that the picture quality actually look like somebody set up a camcorder in front of their TV to tape it!! I have never seen anything so poorly done in my life. It's disgusting that ""Timeless"" production company is actually trying to pass themselves off as professionals. These DVD's are the most amateur edited copies you could purchase. A total waste of money.",1491436800,4,817,4.453333333333333

One reason she likes this season so much is the appearance of the matriarch character, Miss Daisy, portrayed by actress Spring Byington.  As with all the other episodes there is a wonderful display of great human traits to strive for like truth and honesty",1486425600,,427,4.379746835443038

3704402,5,B001MZVZGA,"I have read many reviews on this and I just want to put my 2 cents in.  Even though these DVD of Laramie Season 1, 2 & 3 are not crystal clear and are not in HD, you gotta remember that this television program was made in the early 1960's.  I own all three seasons and have ordered Season 4 too.  I love watching this Western Series and I'm just glad I had the opportunity to purchase these DVD's and watch them as many times as I want to.  The picture and sound are not perfect, but they are a lot better than what I had been watching which was a copy of a copy of the series recordered from a television channel.  If you are a die hard fan of Laramie these DVD's are well worth the money.  98% of the episodes are very clear and crisp and Robert Fuller is great to look at anyway!",1451952000,5,782,3.949044585987261

3704413,1,B001MZVZGA,"This review is purely for the video quality of this set. The show itself was a solid show with 2 solid starring characters, fine story lines, and excellent guests, some of them legendary. The show itself ranks around 3 to 4 stars out of 5. This review, however, is for the embarrasing video quality of this set, probably ranking 5 stars out of 10, a grade of F. In this age of Bluray, who would want to play this set, the terrible video quality hurts the eyes to watch. I am a collector of thousands of tv shows, and I would say that this is the worst retail issue I have ever seen. If you can buy this set cheaply buy it, it is worth having to have a look at this classic show, but I am sorry to say, you will only view it once because of the terrible quality.",1437782400,2,761,4.046357615894039
3704414,1,B001MZVZGA,I love this show so ordered the 3rd season. Was very disappointed in the quality of this DVDs. It really sucks. Very grainy and very clear. Could do a huge better job. Now not sure I want to invest another 30 bucks for another season. Almost unwatchable and I was very disappointed.,1432425600,,282,4.4423076923076925

3704417,1,B001MZVZGA,"The quality was so poor It wasn't watchable. I returned it, but would buy it again if Amazon could guarantee good quality. I was really looking forward to seeing Season 3.",1428019200,2,171,4.548387096774194
3704418,3,B001MZVZGA,"This season sees the return of a child and introduction of a female character to mother the child and tend to the needs of the main characters. Season two saw the loss of the young man that was Slim's brother along with the loss of Hoagie Carmichael. Season three tries to reinvent itself by bringing us back to having a male child and caretaker, through the introduction of Mike a 9 year old boy who is left with no family to take care of him. Then there is Daisy who ends up as caretaker for Mike and the boys. The writers still fall short of what makes this story great in that they  tell too many stories with the main characters separately. To the point that sometimes you do not even see the other characters during the whole episode.  Timeless Media did a very poor job of video transfer on this, hence the 3 stars and not more. Some of the episodes were taken from poor quality VHS tapes.

The writing remains solid, the stories good though repetitive (as I mentioned in another review of season 1). Colorizing just shows how poorly the quality of the video really is.

The case/jewelbox fell apart as I opened it for every disk, the discs are all loose and unable to be secured due to the crappy jewel cases.

Wait for it to go on sale, due to the quality of the video and the packaging, it's just not worth the full price to buy these sets.

3704423,1,B001MZVZGA,I really have enjoyed the show and also bought season one and two which are actually not bad at all. But season 3 & 4 in color are absolutely horrendous. The picture is blurred looks like a VHS bootleg copy to me. Wild hissing that makes the audio even hard to pick up at times. This one went right back to Amazon. They should be ashamed to put their name on something like this it shouldn't even have been released if that's the best quality I could get.,1424304000,4,455,4.181818181818182

3704428,5,B001MZVZGA,"I just purchased all four seasons of Laramie and have wanted them for 4 years now. I had previously downloaded them from YouTube and the quality from YouTube was horrible.  I was worried when I read the reviews about the bad video and audio quality and after suffering through extremely terrible videos of Laramie for 4 years, I was thrilled when I put the DVD in my Playstation and pressed play, I could actually see Robert Fullers face clearly.  The video quality was 100 times better. Yes, there is some minor quality issues but that often occurs with all the old shows I have received.  People who except 1080dpi quality from an old show will be disappointed.  Those of us who know better will be thrilled with what we have gotten. I have collected shows such as Trackdown & Johnny Ringo, which were never put on VHS or DVD so you accept any quality of video you can get.  You just want to preserve the history and the sheer joy of the show. Once these show does become available on DVD,  I purchase it. My love for westerns and the appreciation for the work it takes to restore them, means that we should realize we will never get perfection.  I will agree that they could box the DVD's better. Both my Season 2 and my Season 3 were loose and easily fall out of its holders. I also purchased ""The Deputy"", ""The Tall Man"", and""The Restless Gun"" at the same time and they all came in good packages and in excellent condition.",1414713600,2,1428,4.427480916030534

3704431,2,B001MZVZGA,"I just received this item today and was immediately disappointed to find the outer cardboard case damaged in 2 places and that they had used 3 of those horrible slimline plastic DVD cases each holding 2 DVD discs - however, I have found before, as I did with this item, that the spindle just inside each DVD slimline case is so small that they cannot hold the disc in place!  I had a loose disc floating about inside each of the 3 cases and those discs had accumulated some scratches as a result!

Now, onto my impressions of the video quality - in a word, BAD - poor colour, over saturated/fading at the edges and quite unclear/almost fuzzy images at times as I looked at my TV screen  - I was also not all that happy with the sound and felt it really needs to be cleaned up too - as a result I am NOT going to enjoy watching this at all (if I do watch it that is) - I was so upset that they decided to release such a poor quality version of Laramie Season 3 that I just contacted Amazon to relay my concerns and I was offered a partial refund but I insisted (nicely of course) that I should be entitled to a full refund for such a poor quality and badly packaged item and they ended up giving me a full refund.  I live in Australia so international postage to return the item would be fairly expensive and when I explain this to Amazon they understand and don't require me to return the defective item.

Yes, I did read the reviews here before I bought this item and admit to being concerned but there were some fairly positive reviews and because I really wanted this season I bit the bullet and recently bought it when it was over 50% off - so it wasn't a big outlay - but overall I would never had bought it if I knew what I now do having since received the item.  Yes, TMG does say at the beginning of the DVDs that there are some imperfections and they've used the best quality available etc etc but my view is that they simply should not release such poor quality versions and I'd much rather wait till they can get this series digitally restored/re-mastered or that they simply sell such inferior quality products at a heavily reduced price along with very clear messages to potential buyers about the poor quality.  It is such a shame because I really like this series and want to own good copies of all the seasons.  I would gladly buy it again IF it eventually gets digitally restored/remastered.",1407628800,9,2408,4.288546255506608

3704436,4,B001MZVZGA,"The quality of these DVD's is much better than in season 1 and 2.  The color is not bad , the sound is more even and the overall quality is better than i thought it would be.  Actually, I think that Timeless did a fairly good job with a very old show,  It is, however, extremely frustrating that the packaging remains cheap with most of the center tines broken in each case.  This means the DVD's are floating around in their cases getting scratched and they are very difficult to put away.  This is the only series of DVD's I have ordered that have this as a consistent problem.
  The show itself seems to be back on track as  family entertainment with the addition of Dennis Holmes, a really cute little boy, and Spring Byington, veteran actress for a bit of a motherly influence.  The shows center around the main characters of Jess Harper and Slim Sherman seen more often together than in the 2nd season where it seemed they took turns as the main characters each show.  A new regular character has been introduced by way of the Laramie Sharif.  It seems more natural to have one Sharif than a series of different ones in the first and second season.  Overall, the 3rd season is easy and fun to watch.  Good memories!",1391731200,2,1221,4.42152466367713

I've read reviews on line which criticize the quality of these color episodes, but I personally have no criticisms of them.  I'm approaching the end of these discs, and so far I've been able to enjoy all episodes without any real distractions.  Understandably, they have a dated look due to 60's production values, plus they were planned for no larger than 25"" TV screens.

As usual this series is less about these characters as it is about the leads John Smith and Robert Fuller.  Again most of the stories are sold refreshing wholesome family entertainment in the form of a hour long Western.

While season three saw Laramie switch into a color format, Timeless Media's release quality is actually less than season 1 and 2 in black and white.  While those seasons did have a few episodes where the picture quality was just ""ok"" (a couple episodes looked like from bad video tape quality) this season is actually worse.  Not only are the colors extremely faded in some episodes, there appears to be a lot of cropping of the picture and the sound is extremely muffled.  It really does look like the quality of recordings come from video tape recorded in SLP format.  It is also a real tragedy because this was a great series and it's difficult to make it through the season.  I struggled because I love the show so much but it took a lot of effort.  Compare the picture quality here to any season of the Virginian also released by Timeless...there really isn't any comparison.  It's a shame.  Like other reviewers I highly recommend purchasing this at a steep discount with the advice that buyer beware.  If you love Laramie then you should get it because you may not get a better release EVER!  I for one purchased because the thought of missing out on a classic show when the opportunity is there is one I can't pass up.

It really should be 2.5 stars but I can't bring myself to round up to 3.  I'm glad the episodes are available, I just wish someone would put the effort into this series.",1374537600,3,1983,4.543661971830986

Again from what I've been told, season 3 and 4 were not able to be found and Timeless had to source their copies through other means. There is an apology at the start of the DVDs warning us that the picture quality may not be great. Lets remember though, we are watching a TV show that was  produced from 1959 - 1963 so to be able to watch this show at all is something I am grateful for. These days we are all used to the life-like quality of HD TV, but don't expect anything close to that from these DVDS. I love Laramie, I am a fan, so am just glad to be able to watch the show at all.

3704453,5,B001MZVZGA,"Thank God, ""Laramie"" was shown on German TV on Saturday afternoons, so I never missed it. ""Bonanza"" was aired every Sunday at 5 p.m. and unfortunately my parents never quite made it back with me from visiting my grandmother who lived about an hour ago in the mountains, so I continued missing the first 30 minutes of ""Bonanza"" most of the time.

I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,2,1187,4.959798994974874

3704456,5,B001MZVZGA,"One could say if you are a Laramie fan, you couldn't wait until Universal Studios or Timeless Media Group would release this wonderful 1960's western on DVD. However, in reading some of the comments, there may be a few issues with some of the Laramie episodes playing right on your DVD player &/or quality from both seasons. I understand that Laramie was filmed on 35mm film (16mm film for TV Stations) back in the 1960's when they didn't have all this fancy equipment the studios have now to film in high definition etc.. I think Timeless Media Group did the best they could in providing the Laramie television show on DVDs. At least, we have the opportunity to see this wonderful western again after 50 years. Hang in there! And hopefully Universal Studios will bring this 1960's television show back to life again !!! Until then, thanks TMG for Laramie Season 3 and 4 !!!",1269388800,,874,4.645161290322581
3704457,5,B001MZVZGA,"I was unfamiliar with Laramie until a friend shared this show with me. Robert Fuller started as a stuntman on westerns and then branched into acting. For those fans of his familiar with Emergancy! you will be in for a wonderful treat to see him as Jess. Unlike other westerns were you wonder how the actors are staying on the horse Robert can really ride, also when the horse falls it's really him on it. The show shows its age in picture quality, and its portrayal of indians but overall the scripts are well crafted.

This DVD is the complete third season of Laramie and stands well on its own for those who have missed season 1 & 2.",1269216000,2,635,4.336134453781512
3704458,5,B001MZVZGA,"I first encountered ""Laramie"" in reruns soon after it had gone off the air, loved it, and greeted with delight its appearance on DVD, since (of course) it's impossible to find uncut classic Westerns on TV anymore.  And, like most of the older series (which were made by people who cared about entertainment, not just the Almighty Dollar), it holds up well even 40-odd years later.  Of these 28 episodes, I had seen all but five.  John Smith plays Slim Sherman, a 30-some Union veteran who inherited a small ranch and stagecoach swing station outside Laramie from his pioneering father; Robert Fuller is Jess Harper, the fast gun from Texas who became his friend and partner; Dennis Holmes is Mike Williams, the orphan they take in; and Spring Byington is their housekeeper, Daisy Cooper, a widow from back East who served as a nurse during the Civil War.  ""Laramie"" is almost unique among not only Westerns but all dramatic series of its day: the overwhelming majority of the former, and most of the latter, focused on either a single main character (with or without a sidekick), as in ""The Rifleman"" or ""Gunsmoke,"" or a duo of an older, mentor-type character and an attractive male ingenue (as in ""Wagon Train"" or ""Rawhide""), but here we see two men of nearly an age who interact as equals and derive their success not from a student/teacher relationship but from a meshing of individual strengths and weaknesses.  Slim is steady and serious, shaped by his father's death and several years as the guardian of a younger brother; Jess is quick-tempered and still only half-domesticated, a former Confederate, POW, and, as he admits, ""on a Wanted poster a long time ago,"" prone to exploding when he runs into unpleasant reminders of his own past, but loyal and capable of real compassion.  (In the episode ""The Replacement"" Fuller displays his real skill as an actor when Jess finds himself torn between Slim and a long-ago oath to kill a man.)  Between them--sometimes one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both, often serving as deputies to Sheriff Mort Corey (Stuart Randall)--they cope with outlaws, Indians, crooked lawmen, old friends in trouble and old enemies looking for it, ex-cons trying to make new lives, accusations of murder, people in crises of conscience, rebellious teenagers, people who turn out not to be what they claim, and assorted other difficulties with style and humor.

Like many of the quality A-list Westerns of its era, ""Laramie"" attracted a long list of good guest stars: veterans like Harry Carey, Jr., character actors like Arthur Hunnicutt, Warren Kemmerling, Karl Swenson, Dabbs Greer, Kevin Hagen, John Anderson, Bing Russell, Trevor Bardette, Walter Sande, Willis Bouchey, R. G. Armstrong, Kathleen Freeman, Sean McClory, Henry Beckman, Harry Lauter, Jason Evers, William Fawcett, perpetual Indian Frank deKova, and the inimitable L. Q. Jones, long-time heavies like Robert J. Willkie (who at least once plays it straight as a lawman), Lyle Bettger, Hal Baylor, John Larch, Barton MacLane, Mort Mills, Lane Bradford, Anthony Caruso, George Keymas, and Dennis Patrick, perpetual backups like William Boyett, later stars-in-their-own-right like Leonard Nimoy, Gary Clarke (who became Steve in ""The Virginian""), Russell Johnson (of ""Gilligan's Island""), John Lupton (who plays an Indian-hating character quite unlike his Tom Jeffords of ""Broken Arrow""), Robert Blake (the former ""Little Beaver"" of B-movies and later Baretta), and Alex Cord (credited as Alex Viespi), B-list stars like Rod Cameron, pretty girls like Roberta Shore (Betsy Garth of ""The Virginian""), Ruta Lee, and Susan Oliver, and genuine stars like Dan Duryea and Lloyd Nolan.  The scripts are uniformly fast-moving (you can usually depend on a fistfight or two and some shooting in each one) and always leavened with at least a touch of humor, and most of the exteriors were clearly filmed outdoors.  Of course the perpetual weakness of classic Westerns is the confusion over history: though Slim and Jess agree that the action is taking place about six years after the close of the Civil War (i.e., 1871), all sorts of incongruities find their way into the scripts--mentions of actress Lily Langtry (debuted 1881), the Lincoln County War (1878), the James boys and the Daltons (said to have ridden the area ""10-15 years ago""), and the towns of Billings, MT (""20-odd years ago"") and Tascosa, TX, barbed wire (introduced 1873), and the Colt Peacemakers (ditto) that everyone carries.  There's also some confusion over what Indians the partners should be meeting up with: though Wyoming was largely Sioux territory (and the Sioux do play a part in at least two segments), Arapahoes and Blackfeet also put in appearances--and the various tribal cultures aren't always accurate.  Still, if you love old Westerns you're used to this sort of thing, and the series has the great advantage of being family-friendly, not addicted to gratuitous blood and dirty language like its modern counterparts.

Technically I found the transfer generally satisfactory, with only ""Trial by Fire"" suffering from a hiss in the soundtrack and too bright a contrast.  (Note that Timeless Media did have some difficulties with the early pressings, and if you have breakup or drop-out issues you can contact them directly and get replacements at no charge.)",1263513600,5,5331,5.140877598152425

Timeless Media apparently buys the legal rights to put some of  these TV series out but good prints or video transfers are not always available from the source (NBC Universal in this case) so TM sometimes has to scrounge whatever prints or videos it can from collectors.  They have put out some excellent quality western TV series such as ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" but this is not one of them.

After years of waiting for Laramie to come out on Video (remember that?) or DVD, I am happy to say I now own Laramie Season 3 with all 28 episodes.

Is it a H.D. type of DVD, no. Does it look kinda of old and grainy? Yes in spots. But remember this show is 50 years old and the color and technology we have now wasn't available back then. So color fades, and 35 mm scratches, and no one is going to spend the money to restore it to...wait there is nothing to restore it to cause this is how it looked.

But its great fun to watch and the bonus interview with Robert Fuller is worth the price of the set. At 75 he looks wonderful, and his stories are fun and funny to hear.

I'd love to have ALL four seasons of the series on DVD, but for now I'll happily settle for this one.  The distributor notes on screen that all care was taken to make the best possible reproduction of source material, but that some glitches are inevitable.
