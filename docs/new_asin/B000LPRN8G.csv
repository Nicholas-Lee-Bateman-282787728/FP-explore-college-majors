8163351,2,B000LPRN8G,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewers of this DVD, and I wish I had seen those reviews before wasting my money. This DVD is more of a very basic, low quality, summarized instructional video for preschool teachers. I too was expecting it to be a DVD that my son and I could follow along with, but that's not what it is at all. All of the exercise instructions are initially over-dubbed with very a very basic description of the activity and you can't really hear much from anyone in the video. There are only about 5 or 6 different exercise examples (this is an estimate from memory, I didn't count them when I had it up on the screen), and most of the exercises are cut off and are just there to show you an example. Additionally, the cover is very deceptive, since it does not appear to be the same kids, the same setting, nor does it resemble any of the activity examples on the DVD.

If you are very unaware of any ideas for activities to do with your child (sensory problems or not), this DVD has a few ideas - but it's nothing that can't be written down on a few pieces of paper instead of buying a DVD. Carol's books are MUCH more informative.",1328140800,4,1167,4.280542986425339
8163352,1,B000LPRN8G,"Don't waste your money.  I bought both this DVD, Getting Kids in Sync, and Carol Kranowitz's other DVD on Sensory Processing (The Out-of-Sync Child).  This DVD contained the same information as the Out-of-Sync Child DVD.  More useful were Kranowitz's books, The Out-of-Sync Child and the Out-of-Sync Child Has Fun.",1194566400,14,314,5.36734693877551
8163353,1,B000LPRN8G,"Basically, this is very LOW quality filming of an occupational therapy session.  You cannot even hear what the OT is saying and the narrator provides very basic, useless information.  I was hoping to get exercies ideas for my daughter with sensory issues to do and thought it would be more of a dvd for her to move along with the kids in the video.  This is not at ALL what it is.  I completely wasted twenty dollars and didn't want anyone else with the same expectations I had to do the same thing.  Hope this helps.",1178496000,22,517,4.34375
