8241479,5,B0011EDM9K,Love this DVD!  It is very very relaxing and the music is deep and ambient.  I've heard from many people that it helps them relax and sleep!,1490227200,,140,4.148148148148148
8241480,1,B0011EDM9K,"I can't believe I spent money on this.  It was so boring that I could not even watch one entire chapter and the music was like a single screeching note droning on and on and on.  Some of the chapters didn't even move.  The camera moved back and forth slightly but the jelly never even moved a tentacle. My 10 year old filmed jellies through the glass at an aquarium and it was more interesting than this.  I DO NOT recommend this to anyone.  Save your money.  Plus, it would not work in my DVD player, only on my computer.  If I turned off the sound it would probably put me to sleep but that is the only meditative quality I see.",1267660800,,630,4.114754098360656
8241481,5,B0011EDM9K,"The images are mesmerizing!  Slow moving soft blobs of color floating in outer space.  No Gravity, free flowing in  an eternal moment pf bliss.  For the longest time I was just staring in awe.  Then I realized I am totally relaxed.  These jelly fish images have somehow helped me totally break through into mindful meditation.  The music is like the ocean in an eternal chant of Om.  Fascinating video!  Highly recommended.  There are no special effects.  Honest, real and raw.  Oh, that's right, in ""The Love"" which is the third piece on the DVD, the letters L-O-V-E suddenly appeared out of nowhere and hung in mid-air for a good minute.  A message from the jelly fish to you!  Amazing.",1200960000,5,688,4.6722689075630255
