8438967,5,B004RCLVJ6,"Wow. Wetboy rips the lid off the ugly side of politics in a way politicians don't want you to see. This movie is going to have impact. It's suspenseful, well shot, slowly builds tension, and has got plenty of plot twists. The dialogue is razor sharp, and through the use of repeating motifs (such as the Wilford Brimley character having his secretary announce the hero is coming into his office four or five times in the movie) makes you re-examine just who you can trust. I really hope more people see this movie and I will be working hard to get people to see it.",1314748800,,565,4.390476190476191
