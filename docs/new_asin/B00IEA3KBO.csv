6260929,3,B00IEA3KBO,"First of all, I just gotta say, for the type of film this is and the way it looks and sounds more like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon than anything, the story for Tubby the Tuba is quite brilliant.  It doesn't follow a plot, per se, but rather a series of events that get across a very good message about how life is hard and in the end, all you can do is accept it or make it better.  The production values are nothing special, but the story and writing is fairly intelligent for something that seems to be aimed at a younger crowd.  Unfortunately, I'm guessing this film isn't that popular as it's still yet to get a good DVD.  The first time I discovered this had a DVD, I blindly purchased it without reading any customer reviews, and I wish I had because the final result seemed more like a DVD-rom as there was no way to fast-forward/rewind it, there was no scene select and, maybe it was just my copy, but every minute or so, there'd be brief static messing with the sound.  So when I saw this available for pre-order, I figured maybe they were finally going to release an official DVD, and when I popped it in, already my hopes were high.  It actually had a scene select and something else on the menu that I can't remember off the top of my head.  And as I was watching the opening credits, I was even more relieved as there was no static and the image looked better.  However, after the credits ended, it very quickly dawned on me that this wasn't an official DVD either.  Sure, there was no static, I could finally fast-forward and rewind the thing, but there were two major issues that made it kind of difficult to sit through: the image and sound quality.  The image looks like a really old VHS tape with a TV recording of the film.  Sometimes the colors are off, the images aren't as clear as they could be, but at least this was tolerable.  The sound was what really did it for me.  I had to keep my TV on low volume because the sound was too high-pitched, and even then, I still found myself having to constantly alter it because when the volume wasn't too loud, it was too quiet.  Whenever characters cheered, it sounded more like screeching and nails on a chalkboard.  Half the time when characters spoke, it sounded like the voice actors were going slightly higher than a whisper and nothing more.  And to be fair, I don't think this is the first DVD-rom I've ever bought here.  Mr. Bug Goes to Town I think might have been a DVD-rom as I've heard nothing of it getting an official DVD release, but on the other hand, the sound and image quality were both so good, I was actually fooled the first time I watched it.  I also believe my copy of the 1974 Jack and the Beanstalk film might also be a DVD-rom, but the image and sound, again, are both good enough to have had me fooled.  All I'm saying is that even if this was a bootleg/DVD-rom, I'd be okay with that if the quality was at least good, but it's not.  I give the DVD a pass because, well, I managed to get through the whole thing and, again, at least it's more well put together than the previous DVD sold here, but even so, I'd still like it better if this wonderful film finally got a good DVD for a change.  I know at the very least, music teachers would greatly appreciate it.",1400630400,9,3252,4.263843648208469

8641522,5,B00IEA3KBO,I remembered the story vaguely from my childhood.  I don't know how old I was but the story and music has stayed with me over the years. I purchased it for my grandson who is 3 1/2 . He loves it. It is a fun way to introduce the sound of various musical instruments to the very young as well as the almost old.  It would be nice if someone would re-do it with a more up to date setting.,1457308800,,386,3.8125
