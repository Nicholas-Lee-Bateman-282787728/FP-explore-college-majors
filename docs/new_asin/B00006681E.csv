1711899,5,B00006681E,"In Panic Room, Writer David Koepp and Director David Fincher manage to generate suspense from a seemingly impossible set-up: A mother & Daughter locked in an impenetrable vault (The titular ""Panic Room""), while a trio of criminals try to get in, or failing that, to coerce them into coming out. This ""Die Hard in a room"" set-up could easily have been an overwrought action dud, but Koepp and Fincher build the characters and situation slowly, giving us time to get to know the principals.
  Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart play Meg and Sarah Altman; Meg has just undergone a divorce from her Millionaire husband, and she's purchased a Manhattan ""Townstone"", complete with a Panic Room, a vault-like safe-room, with a water supply and ground phone lines, and an extensive surveillance set-up. Enter Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakum, a trio of criminals who are looking for something hidden in the house. Meg and Sarah hide out in the panic room, but.....what they want is IN the Panic Room......
  All 5 principal actors are excellent; Leto and Yoakum are appropriately menacing, Whitaker manages to be a criminal AND a human being, and Foster is superb as usual. Stewart is great as Sarah, and the resemblance between Foster and Stewart is remarkable. Great casting all around.
  David Fincher continues his streak of great Movies (Seven, Alien 3, The Game, Fight Club), and I'll be looking forward to his next.",1017446400,6,1426,4.970588235294118
1711900,5,B00006681E,"Jodie Foster did an incredible job in this movie and kudos to her and Kristen Stewart who played her daughter. I don't want to give anything away about the movie but it was definitely one that I would recommend to my friends, male and female alike. I was sitting on the edge of my theater chair during a large portion of the end. Forest Whitaker also did an excellent job in his role as a bad/good guy. You wanted to feel sorry for him but he just wouldn't do the right thing... Dwight Yoakum played an excellent bad guy and had you wishing every step of the way that someone would just knock him down a peg or two. Anyway, don't take my word for it, go see it. I don't think you'll regret it.",1017446400,,693,4.140740740740741
1711901,5,B00006681E,"There is more psychological suspense in this thriller than even Hannibal could contribute.  Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a recently divorced woman searching for a home in a wealthier area of Manhattan.  She and daughter Sarah decide on a beautiful multi-level apartment that seems to have a rather unusual lay-out.  The seriously intellectual Meg quickly notices that there seems to be square footage missing from the home.  One room seems smaller than it should.
  How interesting...Meg is right.  Behind a secret wall lies the infamous ""Panic Room"", designed it seems, to withstand (and I am partially joking here) an atomic bomb explosion. The Room is entirely self-sufficient, able to operate and sustain life independently from the outside world.  Everything needed to survive is packaged neatly behind the heavy steel doors (think War Games).  In fact, the presence of the panic room is so omnious and claustrophobic, it becomes an acting character itself.
  How lucky then, are Sarah and mother Meg when a group of burglers, headed by Burnham, (Whitaker)...break into the home in search of a cache of money supposedly hidden in the panic room.  And how unlucky are the two women when it comes to our realisation that Burnham used to be a designer and architect of ""panic rooms"" himself.  He is confident that he can break into the room, using his knowledge of a panic room's inherent design.
The real game becomes a slow evolution from -Can they escape?- and -Will they get in?-, cat and mouse style, to who is most strategic.  Burnham may seem to have the upper hand, but Meg is quick-witted and familiar with her own home.  She plays her cards well and it is exciting to see her instinctual skills come to life.
As the trailers of ""The Panic Room"" now entice you with more and more scenes, take them seriously with their new motto:  bring a friend with you to see ""The Panic Room"", because you will need to hold on to someone.  Great advice. I saw this movie alone and ""The Panic Room"" nearly gave me a panic attack!
Five stars for edge-of-your-seat action, suspense, fantasic performances, and the last minute additon of Jodie Foster to play Meg.  I really don't think Nicole Kidman has the muscle or strength to pull of the physical requirements of a movie like this (She had to bow out due to an injury). Bravo Jodie on surfacing to the limelight again to make another spectacular film!  I believe this is her first film since ""The King and I"".  She proves even a Hollywood Mommy can kick [behind] in a physically demanding role.  I am already impatient waiting for her next move in the film world.  This movie is fabulous and could be a great date flick...especially since you will feel it necessary to grab hold of someone during the intense scenes. Enjoy. I have no doubt you will.",1017446400,27,2798,4.749482401656315
1711902,2,B00006681E,"""Panic Room"" opens with one of the most stylishly elegant, visually arresting and classily designed credit sequences I have seen fronting a movie in a very long time.  Would that the rest of the film managed to live up to that high quality level.  Instead, ""Panic Room"" emerges as second-rate warmed-over Hitchcock with barely a suspenseful moment to be had for love or money.
And love and money pretty much turn out to be the two dominant ""themes"" of this claustrophobic thriller, which stars Jodie Foster as an embittered, recently divorced mother who purchases a spectacular home on the west side of Manhattan for herself and her diabetic teenaged daughter.  The great selling point of this property turns out to be an elaborately designed ""panic room,"" which theoretically will provide a place of safety should robbers ever break onto the premises.  And lo and behold, what should happen on their very first night staying in the place!  You guessed it: three armed men, intent on stealing a secret cache of loot hidden in a safe located right there in the panic room, storm the place and make the young mother and her daughter virtual prisoners in their own fortress-like sanctuary.  The majority of the movie is spent with the two terrified women stuck behind the implacable steel door while the three hoodlums work on ways of trying to ferret them out.
The single noteworthy element of ""Panic Room"" is that master cinematographer, Conrad Hall, has managed to make the house itself into something of a character - actually a far more interesting character than any of the people we encounter in the film.  He does this by having his camera move through walls, creep along air ducts and spy on the inhabitants' activities from bizarre angles, the effect of which is that we get an impressive sense of geography that helps us to map out the intricacies of the building itself.  This is not, however, enough to compensate for an underwritten screenplay filled with hackneyed plot elements, stereotypical characters and precious little in the way of nail-biting suspense.  Particularly grating is the team of three familiar burglars, consisting of the humanitarian with a heart-of-gold (Forest Whitaker), the sardonic but ineffectual ""brains"" of the operation (Jared Leto) and, of course, the trigger-happy psychotic (Dwight Yoakum) who is called in at the last moment and ends up making life just plain miserable for everyone involved, criminals and decent citizens alike.  Straight from central casting, these three men provide us with not one single surprise in the course of the film's running time.
An actress of the caliber of Jodie Foster need do little but phone in her performance in a role as shallow as this one here - which is essentially what she does.  Ms. Foster has exactly two good moments in the film: an early dinner scene between her and her daughter in which she subtly conveys the hurt and confusion occasioned by the breakup of her marriage, and a sequence later in the film when she is forced to play out the required policemen-at-the-door scene (I doubt I am giving anything away by revealing that there IS such a scene in this movie).
""Panic Room"" will probably manage to get under the skin of only the most confirmed claustrophobics.  The rest of us will probably find ourselves breaking out of the theater for quite different reasons altogether.",1017446400,3,3374,4.931216931216931
1711903,5,B00006681E,"Although I really felt again too much had been given to me by the previews the movie was a thriller. Several times I found myself jumping in my seat. Screams occasionally came from the rear of the theater, a good sign I think. The diabetes information was a bit off, incorrect responces. All an all though a good movie.",1017446400,,319,4.423728813559322
1711904,5,B00006681E,"Perhaps you saw Fight Club and could appreciate the visceral intensity but were put off by its muddled message.  Or maybe you saw Se7en and noticed the slick and grainy visual style, but couldn't handle the more grotesque aspects of that film.  Or maybe you (like me) love everything Fincher's ever done and cannot wait to be once again welcomed into his world of paranoia, pathos, and amazing visuals.  Well, no moatter who you are, you need to see Panic Room.
In Panic Room, David Fincher pulls out all the directing stops, every trick in his magic black bag of film wizadry and delivers on a simple, solid suspense story with none of the concept or pretense of his previous films.  This one goes straight for the gut, fiedishly manipulating every standard suspense contrivance, mercilessly playing with any jangly nerve, and keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
There is not one sour note in the whole film (with the exception of the possibly too Hollywood ending, but it still works).  Every aspect of Fincher's technical mastery is on full display.  His camera moves gracefully across every square inch of the house which becomes a prison for Jodie Foster and her daughter, and the three men who break in one night in search of the former owners hidden riches.  In one amazing shot, Fincher moves from the fourth floor of the house where Foster and her daughter are sleeping soundly, all the way down to the first floor where we see the intruders beginning their break-in, throught the handle of a coffee pot, and then all the way BACK UP to the fourth floor where they finaly succeed in getting in without the shot breaking once and sliding the whole time with the cool, slow, impartial grace of a cat burglar.
The premise is simple: Foster and her daughter are locked in an impenetrable room in their home, along with the loot that the 3 bad guys are looking for.  The bad guys want in, the good guys want them out of the house.  The plot is really as simple as that, but in Fincher's hands it turns into a beutifull paranoid battle of wits.  No time is wasted on anywhere and the suspense is instantly in high gear.  The performances are all perfect, with characters fully developed in their first moments of screen time.  You know who everyone is right away, with no time wasted on extraneous details, so all that's necessary is to sit and wait while the tension builds to the breaking point.  It is a terribly effective tactic as it leaves the audience totally open to watch the sparks fly without miring them in sentimentality.
Essentially, if you like suspense, see this movie.",1017446400,,2611,4.625541125541125
1711905,4,B00006681E,"I wasn't expecting much after seeing the previews, but this is the best movie I have seen all year. For those of you who saw the previews and think it looks boring or think the previews tell you the whole movie like ""Cast Away"" did, it doesn't. The acting was great and David Fincher's fresh, awesome directing made this movie great instead of good. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.",1017360000,,387,4.464788732394366
1711906,4,B00006681E,"It's surprising that a person who once directed music videos for the likes of Aerosmith, among others, has become such an exciting and refreshing presence in the demographic-driven tiger cage that is mainstream cinema.  David Fincher, who's cemented a visual style all his own, is also in tune with characters, plot, and action, seldom sacrificing one at the expense of another.  It's hard for expectations to be low for ""The Panic Room"" after films like ""Seven,"" ""The Game,"" and ""Fight Club,"" which gleefully shattered the mold of bland, conventional cinema, but Fincher pulls it off.  Jodie Foster moves into a New York brownstone with her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart), only to wind up fending for her life against three thugs searching for money in the impenetrable room of the title.  That's the basic setup, and for about two hours Fincher (and screenwriter David Koepp) mounts one terrific suspenseful scene after another, all while keeping the heroes and villains human.  Granted, there are some draggy passages, but patient viewers should be satisfied by this exercise in the Hitchcockian style.  Terrific camera choreography, expert performances, and constant twists make ""The Panic Room"" a refreshing alternative...",1017360000,,1232,5.357512953367876
1711907,3,B00006681E,"My problems with Panic Room started at the credits, a weird sort of 3D modeling where the names of the players and writers, etc., are on strange, beveled 3D letters put over New York buildings, it looked like something done in Bryce. If you are reading this it is safe to assume that you know the premise, a recently divorced mother of one is the victim of a home invasion and hides in an impenetrable cubby hole designed by the former tenant, a paranoid old man, a film like this needs three things, great actors, good directing and camera work, and a convincing story and believable dialogue, Panic room has two of these.  Jodie Foster and Forest Whiticer (Spelling)?are as good as ever, Whiticker as the long suffering ""Good crook,"" in the ""good crook, bad crook"" drama that unfolds from the first time we see the intruders.  The director of ""Seven"" gives us lots and lots of cool camera moves and great lighting, menacing blue and lots of shadows and light, but sadly this cannot cover the silly script and forced plot, we just don't believe it.  Many, many times the crooks banter floats off into unintentional humor, there was some laughing on the part of the audience at places we know were supposed to be serious, and way too often we see a character do one thing and then another, for no reason other then the script calls for it.  Foster is great at gasping, panicking and protecting her cub like the lion hearted actress we all know and love, but when she is given a chance, I thought, to do something she doesn't.  The daughter is a very fine young actress who could have been sappy as the diabetic little girl, she has spunk and some good lines but mostly she is there to be rescued.  The over done film school shots of the ""Clues"" at the beginning (The camera zooms in on the insulin in the fridge, and we see Jodie has bare feet, with a foot close up) are obvious set ups and when the pay off comes we have all seen it coming. Many, many times a phone or a gun are just out of reach, this wears thin.  Then there is the ceaseless ""suspense music"" that would have been over done in a radio drama, too much, too loud, too bad, I hope Jodie Foster does better next time, I am sure she will, it wasn't bad, but two out of three just doesn't cut it.",1017360000,,2259,4.338862559241706
1711908,5,B00006681E,"After anticipating this Thriller for so many months after delays in recasting the Lead with Jodie Foster, I finally was fortunate to view the Movie on Monday Night at the Premier. The dynamics from the very beginning are highly energized by the introduction of the Stars of the Movie: Forest Whitaker,Jodie Foster,Dwight YOAKAM,Jared Leto,Kristen Stewart<Etc,ETC. They appear to be suspended from nowhere and that ties into the premise of the Movie. A divorced Mother and twelve year old diabetic daughter in search of a new Safe Haven not too far from the Ex. Who later plays such a dramatic and poignant puzzle in the Movie, You almost can feel the termoil the poor Soul is undertaking. The Three Bad Guys who are in search of what is in the Panic Room go from funny and charasmatic to ruthless and cold blooded killers. It keeps You guessing and ideas on how it may come to an end, only to go a different route and You take a deep breath and realize what a complete RUSH of adrenaline You get when finding out what happens after They manage to get into the PANIC ROOM*",1016755200,2,1071,4.583333333333333

1712148,5,B00006681E,"Huh, I thought I had reviewed this excellent movie a long time ago.  Well it's been over 10 years since I first watched the Panic Room.  I immediately loved it.  I tried watching it again last summer but got interrupted by a phone call a few minutes in so I gave up, but I was able to watch it again last night and recall how exciting it was.

It's about a group of robbers who have knowledge that millions of dollars are kept inside an actual panic room that was built inside an apartment room, so they break in and do whatever it takes to get the money.  Forest Whitaker plays an interesting robber- he's not necessarily on the same page as the other two robbers and often they get into arguments.  He's more like a sympathetic bad guy as evident by his desire to make sure nobody gets hurt and that he just gets the money, whereas the other robbers are willing to do whatever it takes -even kill in vicious style- in order to get the money.

Meanwhile upon Jodie Foster and her daughter/son (seriously I thought it was a boy for the longest time) realizing that robbers are in the apartment with them in the middle of an eerily calm rainy night, they immediately lock themselves inside the panic room which is a tiny safe room made of steel with the intention of being impossible for anybody to break into.  Of course the robbers do everything they possibly can to break through those steel walls- they try taking a crowbar and tearing up the floor underneath, they use gas to try and get Jodie and her daughter out of the room (which backfires literally!) and they even try luring them out with messages written on paper since there's video cameras located all over many apartment ceilings that Jodie and her daughter can see from inside the panic room.

This movie makes suspense live up to its name in a big way. A film where you're constantly on the edge of your seat and don't want to be interrupted until it's over.  Without spoiling certain parts, my memory failed me on a few occasions.  I was convinced Jodie and her daughter stayed inside this panic room the entire movie but uh, no.  Sometimes Jodie escapes in an attempt to grab a cellphone which leads to a memorable slow-moving REALLY intense segment, and eventually Jodie's daughter needs insulin shots (which is clichd- come 'on, someone ALWAYS needs an insulin shot during dire circumstances in Hollywood suspense or horror films!)

Perhaps the best segment is when Jodie tries to make a phone call to her ex-husband for help as quickly as possible before Forest figures out the wires are coming from the basement and destroys them.  It's a race to see if Jodie can make that call in time.  Also when Jodie and her daughter flash Morse Code signals by way of a flashlight into their neighbors window is another magnificent part of the movie since you're curious if the neighbor will catch on.  And the scene where Jodie communicates with the cops but can't give away too much information since revealing that the robbers being in the home could very well put her daughters life in serious danger is another memorable scene.  This scene alone proves why Jodie Foster is such a phenomenal actress.  Perhaps the best segment in the film.

Overall I love the Panic Room, and if you love suspenseful movies you'll undoubtedly love it too.",1429142400,,3303,4.577249575551782

I don't know if William Goldman has a trademark on his name, but I'll tell you he's the very ""Special Guest"".

Fortunately for Meg and Sarah, the `strong room' is in fact a `panic room' built into the house for security.

The home was previously owned by a multimillionaire who installed a Safe Room which in this film is called a Panic Room.  It is a steel and concrete walled room with a steel door and wired for live video of the home, ventilation system, security and a telephone.

On the first night they move into the new home it is broken into by Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the former owner.  He has recruited Burnham (Forest Whitaker) an employee of the security company that manages the safety of the home and a sadistic gunman named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) who has experience. The alarm is set and the family is in bed.  The break in is part of a plan to steal millions of dollars of bearer bonds that are hidden in a safe in the Panic Room and nobody knows about their existence but Junior and his team.

The burglars think the home is empty but are surprised to find that they are not alone in the house.  Meg is not sleeping well and when she turns off a light she sees them in the video monitors and hears them as one of them accidently kicks a basketball.  She grabs her daughter and they run but finally make it into the Panic Room and close the steel door with just seconds to spare.  They try the  phone in the safe room and realize that they never hooked up a second line....

This is an intense and suspenseful film about a standoff between a mother protecting her child and herself and desperate criminals who will do anything to win.  Jody foster just played this role to perfection. (Doesn't she always!)  She almost always plays the intelligent protagonist in the film and this script was made for her.

1712185,1,B00006681E,"Has anyone EVER seen a freaking a movie that was like ""real life""? Even the movies that are BASED on real life get stuck with all sorts of crap to embellish the plot.

My son and I watched ""Panic Room"" the other night. At first, I thought that it would be a pretty good flick. That thought faded away rather quickly. This room was supposed to be impenetrable. By the end of the movie, there were more ways to disable the occupants of that ""impenetrable"" room than there are gates at Disney World.

Here they had a room that was supposed to be surrounded by concrete and steel yet the neighbor heard the screaming from the room and complained to police about it. The air system was compromised. There was a hole in the wall that led directly outside, wires from the outside could be reached from the inside. It was a freaking joke.

I would rather take my chances face to face than depend on a room like that. Whoever wrote the script should be barred from ever writing again. The only good thing that we got out of the movie was that we agreed it was stupid. We were just sitting there talking about how stupid it was and before we knew it, it got even MORE stupid. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 2. On the stupid scale, I would give it a 9. It wasn't totally awful, but it certainly was not good. The only thing that saved it from the bottom of the barrel was the cast, and they should be ashamed for acting in such a piece of crap.

I would rate it slightly better than getting a tooth pulled.

1712190,3,B00006681E,"I'm a rabid fan of David Fincher's work.  He has such a knack for creating sustained tension, so the grit and the aura of suspense permeate every frame of his films.  When he dwells within that niche, he rarely disappoints.

`Panic Room' is a film about just that; a panic room.  A single mother still depressed over the failing of her marriage, moves into a beautiful new home with her young daughter.  One of the big pluses to the home is a panic room; a technically efficient room that will lock itself from outside interference and serve as a safe house in case of forced entry into the home.  Well, this depressed mother soon gets an unwanted housewarming present when three armed men break into her home.  Obviously, she and her daughter immediately race for the panic room, but the shocking reality that the strange men are desperate to get into that room begins to cause sheer panic.

The film's script is a tad underwhelming in parts, but Fincher's direction is superb and the technical achievements here really elevate the film.  The tension is perfectly captured in the sound that inches into our eardrums, the way that the cinematography captures that element of fear and the way that each frame beautifully slides into the next to up the intensity.  The film can get a tad repetitive, and it certainly isn't as gritty as Fincher's previous work (`Se7en' and `Fight Club').  I had made mention to others that `Panic Room' felt like a melding of those two movies, but less successful as it intended to be.  The main issue is that the script doesn't allow us to really care about these people, and the acting comes off rather one-dimensional.  Forest Whitaker and Jodie Foster are serviceable, but they don't really emote anything but the expected.  Dwight Yoakam is kind of a clichd disaster.  Jared Leto and Kristen Stewart (yeah, the one from `Twilight') are the film's two standouts.  Stewart doesn't have a lot to do, but she is rather effective in convincing us of her dwindling health, and Leto is crazed and desperate and chaotic to perfection, actually.

Fincher knows how to push the right buttons, and so his skill certainly creates something memorable out of a skeletal script, but at the end of the day the film's major flaw remains that it is void of any real feeling.",1328832000,,2292,4.71859296482412
1712191,2,B00006681E,"There are some movies that when you watch them they feel like they were just thrown together for a thrill ride.  Jurassic Park III is a perfect example of this.  It's like the screenwriters said, ""Hey, lets throw all these characters on an island filled with dinosaurs for about an hour and a half and watch them struggle to survive, and then lets get them out so we can do another sequel.""  Good character development is thrown out the window because they just want plot.

Panic Room is much the same way.  The story is very simple.  A mother and daughter buy a new house because Daddy decided to get a new woman.  The realtor shows them the house, familirizing the viewer with the layout, gives a brief history of the panic room, which is designed to protect the house's residents in case of a burglary by encasing them in an impenetrable room. The house is on the market because a rich man had just died.

The mother and daughter buy it, and the first night there three burglars enter the house to get money in the panic room.  The women get into the room.  The rest of the film is much like a chess game, with the rules clearly established.  Who wins depends on who has the best strategy.

Panic Room shares the same flaw of Jurassic Park III.  While Panic Room does much better than Jurassic Park III, it still feels just like an excuse to see these characters thrown into a thriller where they have to survive.  The characters are not established as real people you really want to get to know but just a vehicle for the plot.

Overall, Panic Room lacks those qualities that made Hitchcock's films so memorable.  In Hitchcock, his characters never feel like just an tool to move a plot.  The plots themselves are ingeniously drawn, and the endings both shock and tantalize the viewer by tying up the plot into a neat package.  Best of all, his characters are both convincing and legitimate.

The best asset of Panic Room is Forest Whitaker, the most sympathetically drawn character in the entire movie.  He is the only one that feels like a real person instead of just one more plot device.  Had they done the other characters like his character, they would have both the suspense and the right character development to make a truly effective thriller.

As it stands, Panic Room is a film that once you see it, there's nothing to go back too.  You can always go back to a Hitchcock film.

1712192,1,B00006681E,"The title, including probably my favorite actress made me want to see this movie. The setting was brilliant, the idea was brilliant, the execution well, a little inconsistent, no, it was poor. I wasn't sure whether it was tending towards ""Die Hard"", ""Malcolm Alone---"" or ""Wait until Dark"". It seemed to have a bit of all without reaching the standard of action in the former and the suspense in the latter. It certainly ended up having a little bit of unintended comedy. The role of Forrest Whitaker seemed also to be undecided. Was he a slightly bad boy with a good heart who had mixed feelings about being with very bad boys? The bad boys were actually more stupid than intelligent. The room itself was supposed to induce a feeling of claustrophobia, but unfortunately it didn't work with me. The final 30 minutes were a ""little"" bit overdone, no, they were ridiculous. For example waiting in the line for an emergency call to the police,and when they do arrive, they are sent away by Jodie in a similar way as Brian did when asked by the crowd ""Give us a sign"" (at this moment I thought is she stupid?"") Not to forget a criminal climbing up the stairs after a 3 story fall with a half hacked-off hand held together by a rag. I was laughing at the end. Maybe this type of movie works better in the cinema as did the final minute in  ""Wait until Dark"" but I doubt it, anyway I don't want to know now.. Jodie Foster tried to save a poor movie but it was not enough.",1322352000,2,1466,4.389705882352941
1712193,5,B00006681E,"(A review of the 3-Disc Special Edition, if not necessarily the movie itself)
David Fincher, with a list of accomplished films like 'Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'Zodiac', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button', and the recent 'The Social Network', is undeniably going to be called one of the best Directors of his Generation. Its almost set in stone already. What many people don't think of, though, are the high-quality Home Video Releases of his films, particularly on DVD. Whereas 'Panic Room' may be his least-engaging film (outside of 'Alien 3', of course, but to anybody who knows anything about that film's Production, it almost shouldn't count), this 3-Disc DVD release for it contains some of the most instructive and detailed Special Features for any Movie I've yet come across. This puts a number of Criterion Releases to shame. YOU LEARN HOW THEY MADE THIS MOVIE.

Love the movie or hate it, if you're a filmmaker, or a person interested in Filmmaking, this is one of the Must-Buy DVD/Blu Ray sets to have in your collection. So much about this film's creation, from David Koepp's inception of his idea to the film's Theatrical Release, is covered here in remarkable detail. Outside of the FOUR Info-loaded commentaries on the 1st disc, the 2nd two discs contain so much that if I listed exactly what here, your mouth may drop. Let's put it this way: the Special Features are so insightful and so instructional, that they themselves have commentaries loaded with even more information. Like I said: you learn how they made this movie.

What's better? If you are a person who can catch a hint, like if you hear someone mention the phrase 'Negative Pulldown' or 'Digital Intermediate' or 'Image Latitude', and can recognize that somebody is pointing you in the direction of EVEN MORE information, this set is  even more than a must-buy: A 'BUY-THIS-NOW!' DVD set. What more can I say about the Special Features outside of the fact that it isn't one of those boring, half-assed ones that merely feature everyone who worked on the film patting each other on the back the entire time?

Regarding the movie itself, this is the best Home video release of Panic Room available right now. Mastered in HD, the movie looks and sounds great on DVD. Not a half-assed release like that Superbit release of the film. Although not Fincher's best, it isn't bad. In fact, its loads better than many Popcorn flicks, and doesn't take itself so seriously that it becomes pretentious, like so many Bottle Films of its type turn into.",1320710400,3,2516,4.844186046511628
1712194,5,B00006681E,I love love love this movie. It is very suspenseful and I love the twists and turns. Jodie foster is amazing in this one. I highly recommend it to those who like suspenseful thrillers.,1316390400,,184,4.4411764705882355
1712195,4,B00006681E,"When her very rich husband divorces her in favor of a bimbo, Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) moves into a large house in Manhatten close to Central Park and to her former home. On the two Altmans' first night in their new house three burglars (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) enter the house looking for a treasure left by the late owner. The Altmans take refuge in a ""panic room"" in the building, and it turns out that the burglars are looking for something that only the Altmans have access to, and the Altmans need something located in that part of the house which is occupied by the burglars.

Due to Jodie Foster's and Kristen Stewart's acting and outstanding camera work throughout the movie this is a very good movie warranting four stars. Jodie Foster shows just as much of her talent as she did in ""The Accused"", ""Contact"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"". At one stage Jodie Foster must convince two helpful persons to stay away from her house for the time being, and her acting at this point makes the whole movie worth watching.

Another gem is Jodie Foster's and Kristen Stewart's very convincing and moving performance together as mother and daughter. This is Jodie Foster at her best and Kristen Stewart seems to know everything there is to know about being a pain-in-the-neck-teenager who is dependent on her parents because of a chronic illness (diabetes).

Again, the camera work is absolutely extraordinary, and fortunately the crew never gets carried away by its abilities and inventiveness - the camera work is never allowed to dominate. When you see this movie for the third or fourth time, you start to notice more and more ""impossible"" camera movements, which you overlook at the first and second viewing, even though they the performance adds heavily to the suspense.

The script is good as well - nowadays Morse (now obsolete - but it was not when the movie was made) is not learned by joining the girl scouts but from quite different sources. Much has been made of a few inconsistencies in this movie, like whether propane is heavier or lighter than air, but actually there are fewer errors than in most thrillers, and for once the arrival of the Cavalry is plausible.

Unfortunately four male actors constitute a major problem. Their acting is one- or at most two-dimensional, their performances belong to a sitcom, and it is hard to believe that any of the three burglars would dare to join the two others. Another unconvincing point is, that Jodie Foster has hardly ever looked better than she does in this movie, making it very hard to imagine that her weak husband (the fourth bad guy) leaving her for a bimbo (whom we only hear once and don't see). The movie contains much more violence than it has to, and as usual the bad guys are able to survive just about any kind of weapon or fall in order to prolong the action.

A lot of the action in this movie takes place in semidarkness or on several small monitors - don't expect to enjoy the movie if you only have a small screen.",1296259200,3,3058,4.6537037037037035

Foster and daughter Karen Stewart are the home invasion victims who are menaced by three hoodlums for valuables that are stored in one of the house's special rooms built for security. The theme is cat-and-mouse with Foster and Stewart just one step ahead of the robbers. The film has a claustrophobic feel, with the principals seemingly squeezed into close quarters with no wiggle room. Forrest Whitaker stands out as a somewhat sympathetic heavy and Howard Shore's somber music is just right for the movie's pulse.",1282867200,2,668,5.027027027027027

It's only her and her son - oops, daughter, but the kid appears to be a boy until halfway through. Was that Jodie's little inside joke? Then, why do the three crooks persist when they could simply return another night to finish the job? Jodie and the kid weren't supposed to be there, remember? If Dwight Yoakam (funny!), Forrest Whitaker (another actor who is way too smart for this stuff) and the annoyingly psycho Jared Leto are so smart, why don't they just retreat and plot a way to break in when no one is home because, after all, Jodie doesn't know why they really are there, in the first place?

The pair must survive a hellish night of violence when a trio of criminals enter their fortress-like home. The badguy characters range from Jared Leto's (American Psycho, Requiem For A Dream) barely sane ""leader"" role, to Dwight Yoakam's (Slingblade) psychotic, unpredictable ""wild card"".

Fincher takes what could have been a rather dull location, and shoots it in a manic, funhouse-ride style that keeps everything jumping. We go from room to room, upstairs and down, in some pretty inventive ways! The aforementioned cast is more than able to create the right amount of building tension and madness.

I liked the eponymous panic room, a contemporary variant on the impregnable safe place whose effectiveness depends on the human element. I never mind flaws from the standpoint of the logic of reality, those of dramatic logic are more bothersome and there are some damaging ones here. In fact, one such dramatic flaw pretty well eroded my involvement with a segment of the film. One can't reference the film in the interests of fairness to potential new viewers of the DVD. However, what bothers me will probably not affect others so I discount it in judging the film for their benefit. Adding the pluses and minuses,  I believe most people will find it suspenseful entertainment with some good, edge of the seat moments. Not of the first rank, it benefits from the flawed, but, overall, effective performances by Jody Foster,  the star, and Kristen Stewart, who plays her diabetic daughter.

The woman and her daughter attempt

There's big problem.
What the intruders came for is
in that room.
The other problem is that Mom

Jodie Foster is the mom and does
a very nice job of acting the part.

There are many tense moments
and exciting sequences,

to the camera operator.

The camera-work and David Fincher's direction is very good, especially with the low-angle shots in which the camera roams around the house at about floor level. That's very cool. His direction, along with a suspenseful story, makes this film intriguing.

The film in general is just a little too politically-correct, as there are three criminals all breaking into Jodie Foster's house and the black guy, naturally, is the only one shown with a heart.  Jodie Foster isn't real likable here, either, as the liberal mom, nor is the spoiled kid. Parents take note: it's an ""R""-rated film with lots of profanity.",1238803200,,724,4.869918699186992
1712207,1,B00006681E,"David Fincher has fashioned some first-rate films since he started directing movies back in 1992.  The Colorado native called the shots on ""Se7en"" (1995), a gripping serial killer saga starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the cops and Kevin Stacey as the villain, that disturbed as much as it enthralled audiences.  He toyed mischievously with audiences in ""The Game"" (1997) toplining Michael Douglas and Sean Penn in the tradition of George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning Best Picture ""The Sting.""  The incomparable and offbeat ""Fight Club"" (1999) qualified hands down as Fincher's finest, reuniting him with Brad Pitt and co-starring Edward Norton in a pre-terrorist 9/11 opus.  Until he made the Jodie Foster crime film ""Panic Room"" (*1/2 out of ****), ""Alien 3"" ranked as Fincher's least distinguished epic, with a shaven-headed Sigourney Weaver impersonating science officer Ripley for the last time as a flesh & blood human being.  Comparatively, as the least commercial entry in the creature-feature franchise, the anemic ""Alien 3"" induced sleep rather than suspense.  No matter how atrocious ""Alien 3"" seemed, ""Panic Room"" weighs in as infinitely worse.  Only deep-fried Jodie Foster fans will savor this superficial, occasionally sadistic exercise in futility.  Actually, the producers cast Nicole Kidman, but she injured herself and pulled out.  A hopelessly miscast Jodie Foster brings a certain elegance to this unexceptional nail-biter.  Indeed, lensers Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji's atmospheric cinematography, the eerie lighting, and the looming interiors win ""Panic Room"" brownie points, not nearly enough.

This inferior feminist fable takes its title from a 12 by 12 foot, steel-plated, concrete bunker inside a four-story Brownstone in Upper West Side Manhattan.  The reclusive tycoon who owned it has died, and our divorced heroine, Meg Altman (a bespectacled Jodie Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"") now occupy the place.  Plagued by paranoia, the late millionaire equipped the townhouse with a secret room.  This impregnable bomb shelter boasts a high tech surveillance system with a cameras that scan the premises 24 hours a day from every angle inside and outside.  The chamber contains its own ventilation system and features a separate telephone line.  During the first night that Meg and Sarah sleep in their new beds, they awaken to find themselves at the mercy of three harebrained hoodlums out to steal millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds that the dead financier concealed in a vault in the safe room.

Predictably, Meg and Sarah hole up in the bunker while Junior (Jared Leto of ""Girl, Interrupted""), Burnham (Forrest Whitaker of ""Bird""), and Raoul (country singer Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade"") toil incompetently to evict them.  Aside from their vulnerability as females-at-risk with flaws--Meg suffers from claustrophobia, while Sarah requires insulin shots)--these females do little to appeal to our sympathy.  Ironically, Whitaker's character emerges as not only the most sympathetic but also the most interesting.  Poor Patrick Bauchau of ""A View to a Kill"" plays Meg's millionaire, ex-husband (no relation to the deceased tycoon) and takes a hellacious beating from Raoul in a scene which will undoubtedly sicken some viewers.

This tedious, third-rate tale unravels from the outset with a premise as contrived as it convoluted plot.  What veteran scenarist David Koepp of ""Stir of Echoes"" fame doesn't steal from his own scripts, he appropriates from the durable Audrey Hepburn thriller ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) and the exciting Sean Connery caper ""The Anderson Tapes"" (1972).  The Raoul character clearly recalls the Mafia thug in ""Anderson Tapes"" that veteran character actor Val Avery played in a ski-mask with a penchant for violence.  The ending that disposes of the bearer bonds comes straight out of John Huston's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948).  Had the ""Panic Room"" been a tenth as entertaining as any of those classics, this derivative mishmash with its unintentionally hilarious histrionics might have proven tolerable.  Instead, ""Panic Room"" resembles a heavy-handed Lifetime channel version of ""Home Alone.""  Decked out in a black, tank-top to display cleavage, Jodie Foster imitates the antics of Macaulay Culkin as she battles a trio of bungling burglars.  These clueless cretins make the Three Stooges appear like intellectual titans.  Foster is a top-flight actress who shouldn't have stooped to this one-dimensional nonsense.  Koepp's script bristles with inconsistencies.  After making a big deal about Meg's claustrophobia early in the film, Fincher and Koepp unaccountably drop it from the plot when they tighten the screws on our protagonists.  The scene with the butane gas tank elicits derision more than dread, and the flashlight batteries in another scene were clearly of the Eveready variety.

Though, I have to admit that the way they generated the drama with the location was quite impressive.

This is a movie based around the story of a robbery gone wrong.  The robbers didn't expect anyone to be in the house, but Jodi Foster's character and her daughter had already moved in early.  The house has some unusual features, such as an elevator and a panic room.  The panic room, which the movie is named after, is a small room that people can hide in and survive if attacked.  It's behind very thick steel, so it's nigh impossible to get through and it comes complete with a camera surveillance system.  Naturally the robbers were expecting the room to be empty, but Foster really throws that wrench in their plans.  What they're after is in that room, it just so happens that one of the robbers installs those kinds of rooms, thus enter Forest Whittaker.  As you can see the stage is set for a very suspenseful ride.  The whole movie takes place in this house and really doesn't go anywhere else.  That alone is fairly impressive.  Seriously, to stay on screen for two hours and not leave the same location, that takes pretty good writing and they do manage to pull it off.  Not to mention this is all done with like five actors and a sixth enters later with almost no lines.

Despite the very competent acting, the film still felt a tad drawn out.  This is a shock to hear me say because I'm usually the guy wanting more out of the movie!  The suspense was certainly great and the acting was very well done.  However, I can't see myself watching this numerous times in the future and that's what really separates a great movie from an okay movie for me.  I did like the interaction with the robbers the most once they realized their carefully laid plans weren't going very smooth.  The audience is meant to eventually sympathize with Whittaker's character, which I thought was a bit of an interesting twist, though I really don't think Whittaker would make a really good down and dirty robber with loads of violent experience.  Seriously, it's just not him, so he was perfect for this role of a man who was in over his head, so to speak.

I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing once, at the very least.  If you're a fan of Jodi Foster films I don't see how this could possibly disappoint you.  I'm not a huge fan of hers, but I typically enjoy the films she puts out.

1712215,3,B00006681E,"New York itself plays a major role in Panic Room, where the paranoid need protection from the hyper, anxiety-saturated dark element.  It's, evidently, where back-alley threats and urban terrorists attack the pure and virtuous wealthy New Yorkers.

Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) are living in a spacious Upper West Side brownstone town house, with architecture that reflects the priciest of pricy New York abodes - large and expensive enough for three or four young professionals to live in, and they'd still have to live off of ramen a few times per week.  Meg attained her home via the money-grubbing divorcee route, with real estate revenge as her sole purpose for even choosing the Richie Rich option in housing.

In this ridiculously large home in which Meg and her daughter have ten times the room they truly need, there is no real need to furnish the house.  Instead, Meg is worried about her WASPish needs such as finding the corkscrew for her wine bottle, how to steal more money from her ex-husband, and, oh yeah, making sure she has enough diabetes medicine for her daughter.  On top of all the other opulence, they have a luxury above all other needless luxuries: a panic room.  This panic room is the amenity of all amenities, and for only the filthy rich.  It acts as a barricade for an extended period of time for any and all rich occupants, and via its Ft. Knox security and armaggedon stockage, all rich occupants remain safe from all non-rich people.

In the case of this movie, I was kind of hoping that the criminals would win because the money and security clearly wasn't earned.  However, the three criminals in his movie aren't that lucky.  Burnham (Forest Whitaker) is a safe-cracking, goofy-as-hell yet somehow intelligent role tailor made for Forest Whitaker.  Junior (Jared Leto) is the ADD-riddled, get rich quick bad element generically typical in every psychological thriller.  And Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) is the heartless psychopath of the group, ubiquitous to this type of movie.  While fighting for power and control, the criminals build tension and suspense, allowing the viewer to not only choose sides between Meg and the villians, but also amongst the villians themselves.

1712216,5,B00006681E,"David Fincher's pacing and cinematography is worthy of praise. This movie written by David koepp is a stunner. Jodie and Forest whitaker shine as the stars. It is a simple cat and mouse game yet not a minute of the movie deviates from the suspense. It is the minimality of digression that is the key here. The director does not leave the story line to chase any ponderous or emotional moments. From when the burglars enter the house till the very end the suspense refuses to die. The concept of the panic room, the strong hold, the very room the burglars are after is novel. In many places in the movie the tables are turned and the movie goes from jodie's character has upper hand TO burglars have upper hand  sitation. In the end Jodie's character goes into the Bruce Willis Die hard mode. One pitted against the gang where she has to outwit them. The movie is violent and brutal in the scenes where it is necessary. The fun is in how the burglars try to get Jodie's character to come out of the panic room. Nicole Kidman was originally to star in the role of Meg Altman (Jodie), but had to back out due to a knee injury she sustained during the filming of Moulin Rouge. However, she did add her voice to the movie portraying Steven Altman's girlfriend and talking with Meg Altman on the phone. The movie is fully shot in a house and it's amazing how even without change of environments,sets and no expensive costume design,  one is still glued to the screen. The location is still the same house. So where lies the gem ?. The gem is in the suspense and plotting and in the deep seated desire of every movie goer to see the underdog win.

That's what happens when Jodie Foster (who works hard to save this film) and her daughter get stuck in the panic room of their new mansion, where three thieves have broken into. The problem, of course, is the treasure they want is in the panic room, so the two women are forced to spend quite some time in this room, which is not such a terrible problem, since it has been built for that same purpose. The room contains a toilet, flashlights, fire blankets, a medicine kit--pretty much anything you would need in an emergency, except a single piece of food. Maybe the builders of the panic room expected people to eat the blankets.

1712224,3,B00006681E,"This was a dark movie as a single mother and her pre-teen daughter, Sarah, moved to 94th Street.  It was strange to get oout and search for an apartment at night.  With the scary movie, you have to use imagination to figure out what they are doing.  The owner specifically showed them the Panic Room and explained what its purpose was, to hide from things. The secret is that $30 million was hid in this hidey hole. The rooms were pretty large as Sarah rode around on her scooter; schoolhouse lights hung from the ceiling.  Meg, (Jodie Foster in glasses) appears to be a homely type.  The intruders knew that the house had a peep-hole.

Perhaps all of the darkness makes for mystery. but it would have been more effective had the film been made in black and white.  Lighting has a lot to be desired.  Everything was dreary, no fun, no laughter.  It was most frustrating to not be able to see what is happening.  I've never liked movies filmed at night in big cities, or in the dark indoors.  We could see silhouettes of violence as the three outsiders tear the inside of the house apart with sledge hammers and noisy, loud chainsaw, looking for the stach of money.

Camera work was erratic and the conversations confrontational with no love shown.  It was verbally abusive with lots of swearing and cussing.  This was like a late-night soap opera in drag.  The visitor did not take the spoils.  Instead...  Sarah was more adult than her mom at first.  Terror and abuse is something some kids learn in an unhappy marriage.  It is possible that Meg's husband, Steve, is involved with this intrusion.

Before Sarah suffers a panic attack, after seeing her university prof father talking to the criminals, Meg becomes hysterical as her cell phone was not of much use in the Panic Room.  She had called her husband and said ""there are three...""

The concierge, French for superintendent of supplies like Mona claimed to be in a Los Angeles hotel where Nat King Cole called her Mona Lisa, was avaukabke at a fancy apartment house near Central Park.  Some way, Meg had sent a subliminal message on the phone; the police arrive at the request of Steve.  At least, they know how to treat a woman out there, as opposed to K. P. who showed me no respect or integrity to a woman who was almost killed.  After the rescue, suddenly we see color as things appear normal for the first time.

Meg and Sarah are out in the Park on a Fall day in glorious color.  How much better this movie would have been had we seen a bit of that color throughout and not relegated to the ending.  It was wasted by then.  There is no honor among thieves.",1168473600,,2620,4.479915433403805

1712226,2,B00006681E,"This review is more about the ""SuperBit"" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.

However, the transfer on to this 2002 ""SuperBit"" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and ""Making-Of"" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.

They have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.

First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.

""Panic Room"" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.

This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.

If they had encoded ""Panic Room"" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.

Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.

I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.

Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold.",1161043200,7,3428,4.4281150159744405

1712228,4,B00006681E,"Jodie Foster, director David Fincher and the rest of the cast excel at providing loads of suspense in an interesting high concept thriller.

Panic Room derives it's effectiveness and fascination from a very basic human need - the necessity of security and safety. At one point one of the bad guys played by a greasy, corn rowed Jared Leto tells his gang of bumbling burglars that women - referring to a now firmly locked up Jodie Foster in her panic room - need safety and security. He wants to play on that to psych her out of the veritable vault that's preventing him from stealing his family's wealth. I think this sums up alot of why the movie works. There are lots of bad guys out there and at night when we shut the lights and go to sleep, they just might want to break in and prey on us. By having shelter within a shelter - a virtually impenetrable vault to hide - we feel safer, more secure and maybe we're even able to sleep better.

Of course how many of us could afford a panic room? So with this film, we can live vicariously through Foster's character and her daughter as they make a stand against the intruders in their home. Fincher's direction is spot on terrific. He's a director who can evoke Hitchcock effortlessly, while never mimicking the master's style. The intricate camera work which pans over the elaborate and convincing sets may owe alot to digital magic, but it never looks synthetic.

1712230,4,B00006681E,"I remember seeing this film in the theater and being surprised at how much it differed from what I expected yet surpassed my expectations.  I expecting a scary gritty film like Fincher's previous 'Se7en' or even something more along the lines of 'Fight Club', a gritty smart film that keeps your attention and blows your mind.  Instead, I got a gritty smart film...period.  Nothing overly fantastic happens.  No revelations are disclosed before the credits roll but every frame is strategically placed together in an effort to hold the viewer in constant peril until the final frame...and for the most part it works.

The story revolves around a divorced mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Stewart) who move into a new home just in time to have it broken into by three armed men (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker & Dwight Yoakam) looking for a fortune left over by the previous owner.  These men are all different breeds and that's what adds to the layers of this film.  Leto, who to me is the star here, is the impatient flamboyant leader who knows where the money is and desires it the most.  Whitaker is trying to take care of his family and needs this money the most.  He's also the sensitive level headed one.  Yoakam is the calm and collected psychopath who might as well kill everyone to get what he wants.  When these men enter the house only to have Foster and Stewart lock themselves in 'The Panic Room', the only safe room in the house yet the only room the intruders desire to enter (that's where the money is) then the film gets extremely smart in showing how these men try and smoke them out sort-of-speak, and then turns to cat and mouse when things start to get out of hand.

For the most part this is very effective, and I might even say it were effective 100% if it weren't for the fact that it really gave me no feeling.  I didn't really care about any of the characters...and to me Leto was the only real standout as far as acting.  Foster is a great actress but a little dry here (too bad Kidman was hurt...she would have been sensational!) while I will admitt Stewart is quite convincing.  The movie has a few jump scenes but nothing that will really evoke any fear and that's too bad because with a little tweaking this could have been brilliant...just add in a touch of the underlying fear of 'Se7en' and the mind-blowing truism of 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room' would have been another Fincher classic.

1712235,4,B00006681E,"I think I'll keep this one short.  'Panic Room' is a sharp, well-executed thriller.  In terms of plot and ideas it's definitely a cut below earlier Fincher films like 'Fight Club' and 'Seven'.  (You spell it 'Se7en' and I cut you! I cut you bad!!!)  Still, Fincher's technical ability shines thru along with a reasonably plausible and intelligent script to allow this to be a very worthwhile film, even if it doesn't really have a terribly strong impact once it's all over.

You gotta already know the setup, but here it is: Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her creepy hermaphrodite child move into an absurdly massive and fancy house in New York (?), one which was inhabited by a rather eccentric old man who was particularly concerned with security.  Thus the house contains a panic room, which contains an additional phone line and various video screens and is just virtually impenetrable.  On their first night in the house a trio of burglars break into their home, and Meg and her daughter flee into the panic room.  Trouble is, they've got no way to contact the outside world, and the items the thieves are after are located in the panic room itself.  And that's about it.  As is true of most well-done thrillers, a lot more happens within this scenario than you likely would've thought possible, all with out becoming to terribly contrived.

Fincher has always been a great visual stylist, and that ability is nicely displayed here, with smooth, gliding camera movements combined with CGI for clean movement all about the house.  The whole thing is just very dark and ominous, as per usual, but in sleek, modern way rather than the clattering industrial mess you'd find in 'Seven'.  Performances are first-rate, though there is occasionally a disturbing lack of characterization.  This is particularly a concern for Foster's character, as she is, theoretically, the protagonist, but proves to be pretty flat, and didn't really draw any particular sympathy from me.  And the kid, ooh the kid is just as annoying as hell.  By the end of the film Forest Whitaker's Burnham, one of the robbers, proves to be by far the most interesting and sympathetic character of the bunch.  This allows us to sympathize with someone, I suppose, which is nice, but for much of the film I was interested in what was going to happen, but I didn't especially *care*.  A wide variety of results would've been acceptable.  The film does do a nice job of slowly revealing the true nature of the characters as we move along, but this does mean that they start out pretty faceless.

Thinking back I have a hard time remembering the particular flow of events in the film.  It is, again, a bit more plausible than your average thriller, and most of the events flow into one another smoothly enough that it seems like a fairly continuous whole.  It's harder to dissect and pick apart in my mind, which might make it hold up better on repeated viewings.

That's about it, I guess.  The DVD looks very nice, as you'd expect for a Superbit one.  Again, I dunno if this is the sorta movie that's gonna impact anyone terribly, but it's done with enough panache and professionalism that it proves very watchable, and I'll no doubt pull it out for another viewing every once in a while.

1712239,5,B00006681E,"I'm reluctant to make lengthy comments on films about which hundreds of others have already posted, it seems like a waste of time, so I will just make a few observations about ""Panic Room"".

The most important thing was that it instantly pulled me in and took me for a ride for the entire two hours. That does not happen often, particularly for a film that I was late seeing and about which I therefore had tons of preconceived notions. I was pleased with how well they established the basic premise of the film at the beginning, something that had seemed silly in the trailers was perfectly credible in the actual film. The $95 Million U.S. box office must have happened from word-of-mouth because the trailer simply does not do the film justice.

There were only minor plot holes, although the lame way that Meg and her daughter initially get into the panic room almost derails the whole thing. And I still find it inconceivable that $48 Million had to be spent on what is really a very small film. Since so little of the budget ever makes it onto the screen they would have been better served with the creative incentive of a smaller budget.

Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play Meg but hurt her knee and had to drop out. I don't think they lost anything by bringing in Jodie Foster, I can't imagine Kidman doing any better, Meg's kind of brainy stubborn scrapper is Foster's specialty. And she is much better from a physical casting perspective, as Kristen Stewart looks like she could actually be Foster's daughter. In fact, there were more that a few times when I momentarily got the two of them confused. This was very appropriate because ""Panic Room's"" heroines are not the usual film-fare mother and daughter (one strong and one weak), but rather a ""like mother-like daughter"" situation. I think Stewart has a great future in films (see ""Speak"" for a example of her ability to carry a whole feature) and it was nice that she got a chance so early in her career to work closely with Foster.

I was particularly impressed with the pacing of this story and its similarity to chess masters hiding one line of attack inside another. The battle progresses much like a chess match, as pieces are lost the layout becomes less familiar and the alternatives fewer. As the two sides use up resources and get sucked in deeper, their earlier choices limit the choices that are available to them. This chess-like process holds until the very end of the film.

""Panic Room"" is one of those DVDs you see in the rental store on Friday and decide to try out; a week later you can't remember what you saw, exactly. See? Just like carbon monoxide, the movie slaughters two of your finite hours on Planet Earth that you could have been using more enjoyably.

Yes, this is a locked-room mystery, where the locked-room in question is a high-tech secret chamber located in an Upper Eastside Manhattan townhouse, and where the mystery is why a normally gifted, edgy director like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) would direct a boring, colorless clunker like this.

Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a divorcee who with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart, who has three modes: sullen, smirking, and sick) moves into a multi-million dollar New York townhouse. Mother and daughter discuss their mutual disdain for the new digs, eat a pizza, and fall asleep.

Now: it's fortunate Jodie toys with the high-tech Panic Room before turning in, because---wouldn't ya know it---along come three villains with the vilest of intentions. Talk about a bad first night in the new pad!

It turns out the trio of thugs want the fortune stowed in the panic room by the townhouses's previous owner, and in their bumbling they manage to alert mom and daughter, who scuttle into the little fortress-within-a-fortress. So what you end up with is a 2 hour+ siege movie. Siege movies can be great, or they can be tedious; this movie takes the latter path and with, evidently, no regrets.

It doesn't help that two of the three villains are pretty much out for the count when they realize they have to take on real live people holed up in the panic room. Dwight Yoakum plays Raoul, who is the real deal, a determined psycho if there ever was one, and he rallies his team's flagging spirits and the three determine to beg, borrow or steal their way into the high-tech little broom closet.

And that's pretty much it. The much-touted CGI enhancement of camera movements in the townhouse is fine, and this is a technically competent movie. It's also a massively boring movie, and imminently forgettable; everything here has been done before, far more masterfully, in an underrated little gem called ""Wait Until Dark"". Everyone in ""Panic Room"" seems bored, and it's a contagious emotion, because by the conclusion you'll be bored too.

Jodie Foster plays Jodie Foster, who toys with claustrophobia for about 5 minutes but tosses that potentially intereting plot device aside as soon as the going gets tough. She turned down a reprisal of the Clarisse Starling role in ""Hannibal"" for this?

The incomparable and talented Jared Leto (""American Psycho"", ""Requiem for a Dream"")tries to liven up the dull proceedings, and gets a bullet in the head for his efforts. Forest Whitaker cashes a check, and Dwight Yoakum, unrecognizable until the credits, plays the sleepiest psycho in cinematic history.

If you're fine wasting two hours of your life on a dead, dull, dismal, and oddly colorless siege movie, then by all means rent ""Panic Room."" My advice: spend the time going through a brochure to build a panic room of your own---at least you'll get something out of *that* ordeal.

1712243,4,B00006681E,"Jodie Foster stars in this amazing thriller from director David Fincher (the director of Fight Club and Seven). Foster plays a divorced mother living with her daughter and they move into a large mansion in New York. But, unfortunately, while there, 3 robbers invade the house, as they didn't know that anyone was moved into the house. Foster's character and her daughter hide themselves in a ""panic room"", which no one else can get in after the door is closed because the door is so heavily reinforced. But, what the robbers want is in that room, so they will do everything possible to get in. It's a good thriller with some very suspensful moments, but if you're looking for lots of scares, this probably isn't it. It has some funny moments and some great action scenes that are memorable. Foster acts great in the film as does Forest Whitaker, who plays one of the robbers. Highly reccomended.",1119398400,,895,4.707006369426751
1712244,5,B00006681E,"It's actually kind of remarkable that David Fincher has never made an outright terrible movie. Yeah he did do Alien 3 but in all fairness: with a nagging studio, production problems and an incomplete script, it's surprising there's something at least watchable with Alien 3, particularly its ""Assembly Cut"". But for every great film from Seven to Fight Club to Zodiac, we have the pretty good films such as the Game and this one. They're not as highly regarded but they're still fun entertainment and worth a watch, even if there's nothing to be gained from watching except for a good time.

Meg and her daughter Sarah have just moved into a new house in New York. It's pretty big (maybe a bit TOO big) and it has a unique feature: a panic room, which has steel plating for walls, video surveillance system and a phone line not connected to the house's main line. It's the perfect place for a family to be safe when people try to break in. Of course that's what happens on the first night as 3 thieves: Junior, Raoul and Bernham show up and rather than wanting Meg's things, they want what's inside the panic room. The film then becomes a game of cat and mouse as Meg has to somehow outwit 3 robbers who want in.

It's often been said that a script in the hands of a talented director can be a great film regardless of the thinner qualities of the script. No more is this evident in Panic Room which had anyone else directed (or at least, anyone who's a hack) it would've been awful. Sure there's not a lot to the script and you can tell screenwriter David Koepp threw as much as he could to give characters to do but damn if it doesn't work. To keep things interesting, Fincher uses a lot of computer assisted camera moves to keep things flowing with one of the best being a long take as the robbers initially start to inspect the house. Some work while others, such as going inside a lightbulb filament seem kind of unnecessary like it was a means to be playful.

Acting-wise we have Jodie Foster who plays a great Meg; someone who's not an action superstar but is more than capable when she has to be. Kristin Stewart, who in my opinion, was the only thing that made the Messengers watchable plays the daughter Sarah and she's also quite good here. The 3 robbers played by Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam are quite a fun team to watch but have enough menace for Meg to fight with, particularly Yoakam who's quite the crazy bugger and probably also has one of the better entrances when you finally see his face since he had a ski mask a good chunk of the movie.

One might find it odd that a film like Panic Room, which is essentially a superbly made B-movie, has tons of special features, even moreso than Seven or Panic Room's. We have director's commentary, star commentary with Foster, Yoakam and Whitaker who are also directors and a screenwriter's commentary. Then we get behind the scenes looks at the making of the film to featurettes on pre-visualization to the special effects shots one by one. Some discs are packed with stuff but seem kind of light and you could get through them in one afternoon; here it's kind of daunting.

This isn't Seven or Panic Room but then again this ain't no Alien 3. It's entertainment for the sake of entertainment and considering how well it works (for some anyway), that's more than enough for a watch.",1114128000,2,3362,4.4869281045751634

Nicole Kidman was suppose to play the star role, but with her injury in Moulin Rouge, Fincher asked Jodie Foster to do it and I heard she didn't really want to play this role, but after watching the making of it on the bonus DVD's, she was really looking forward to it...I had to re-purchase this movie though in the 3-Disc Special Edition though once I found out that Columbia re-released it...Which is very much worth it if anybody owns the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Fight Club which I thought was out of print, but found about 8 copies of it at a Best Buy location.  Panic Room being a movie about home invasion and what the three men want (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, & Dwight Yoakum) are in the panic room and Foster and her kid (Kristen Stewart) do not let them in.  The three men begin to find their own ways to get into the panic room, using a small gas tank and gas them out to just giving them the finger on camera and cussing at them from outside.  Their situation gets more horrifying when Foster's husband in the movie visits them after a frightening phone call.  He gets beaten to death on camera while Foster and her kid watches painfully.  The tragic  ending involves two of the men dead and one escaping with the  money that was hidden in the floor panel of the panic room.  Foster and her kid find a new place in New York City.  Fincher made a great MAZE of a movie in this dark movie of home invasion.

The major setback is in relation to the plot, which is about average. Specifically, the mother does some pretty incredible and unrealistic things such as the setting of the propane on fire!

Or the whole wire tapping and getting the telephone to work thing...

Moreover, Kristen Stewart playing the ""daughter"" was not that wonderful.  The seemingly genderless child, who is surprisingly cool throughout the whole ordeal, is really not that great.

Panic room has an interesting story, great cast, and strong acting.  What it truly lacks is believability.  Maybe the average joe will accept some of the stupidity of the film, but I was unable to.  Firstly, why built THAT strong of a panic room, yet have a flimsy air vent to the outside?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose?  Second, and most importantly - is the undercurrent of suspense as to the health of Jodie Foster's daughter.  She supposedly has diabetes.  During their stay in the panic room, the daughter slowly but surely gets worse, because she needs insulin.  She looks through the MRE (military-style vacuum-packed meals) for something that will ""raise her blood sugar"" but is unable to find anything.  This is pure BS.  Any food will raise your blood sugar, but the contents of the MRE, which had candy, peanut butter and other items, would do a perfect job of raising her blood sugar.

All the time, I was like, ""What's gonna happen next?"", ""Don't do that!"" and all of that stuff we like to yell out loud. Jodie Foster gave a good performance and Dwight Yoakum plays the villan brilliantly. And it has its humorous moments. Overall, it's a good thriller, but still comes nowhere close to David Fincher's other thriller Se7en.

1712251,5,B00006681E,"I must admit that the premise of this flick is quite lame. Before hearing who was in the Director's chair I immediately said 'There is no way I am going to see this', a kick in my ass came shortly after a friend of mine told that David Fincher was directing it. I dig David Fincher so much that if he decided to a movie about a monkey trapped in a mental asylum, I'd still see it. Hm.. now that actually sounds like a spiffy flick.. maybe I can write a script for it. So yes, it's David Fincher folks, he is good at whatever he does, thus this movie was good as well.

This movie is quite simple, it also seems like it could be a 20 minute cartoon on the tube, but when you have David Fincher behind the camera you can't help but get plunged into it. Just the dark-gloomy visuals of this flick are absolutely breath taking. The eerie mood created by the enormous house, humorous crooks going after the panic room, it's all in here!

So here go...Meg Altman played by Jodie Foster (Silence Of The Lambs, Contact) is a divorced mother who moves into this enormous palace with her daughter Kristen Stewart (Sarah Altman). Not even fully settled in, they are awaken by three burglars played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam whose plain is to go after what is in the 'panic room'.

Not expecting anyone to be in the house, they soon find out that Meg & Sarah Altman actually moved in tad bit early. This of course gets into their way of robbing the house in peace and comfort and everything pretty much goes off the planned road.

Seeing that this movie is a 'thriller', it does however resemble Fight Club for a tad bit. It is fraught with anecdotes just like Fight Club was. I found this unbelievably cool even though some people disagreed, some were saying that the movie could have gone without the humorous incidents. I don't see the big deal, I actually thought it was kind of cool.

So what exactly is so good and so bad about this movie? The good is the way the movie was shot, the mood that was created from the story, the breath-taking visuals (blue flame explosion scene) & the opening credits (tell me that didn't look slick as all hell?) and of course the odd chemistry between the burglars. The bad is of course the plot turns, you could pretty much just sit there and call them one by one. Maybe some people will actually think that's cool, I don't know. I personally like being surprised more than  being able to tell what will happen next. The ending also left me kind of 'eh? what, no no no, ah come on' simply because I fell for one of the characters whose fate was kind of sad. The ending is not bat at all, this is purely my own opinion. Overall I was entertained by the movie and not once did I put my head down out of boredom.

When three men break into the house, Meg and Sarah take refuge in the house's unusual ""panic room"", an indoor fortress meant to serve as a hidden and impenetrable haven for its residents.  The problem is, the burglars not only know about the panic room, but they will do anything to get what is hidden inside it.  Closed off from help, the women must rely on their resourcefulness to repel the equally determined intruders. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do.  This is ""Home Alone"" with a deadly seriousness.  (The screenplay acknowledges this when one of the burglars calls another ""Joe Pesce."")

The trailers for this highly suspenseful film made it seem more terrifying than it actually is.  ""Panic Room"" relies more on tension and desperation than it does on sheer fear - and it is a much better film for it.  Jodie Foster turns in a skilled, believable performance, as does Kristen Stewart, who not only looks like she could be Foster's biological child but acts that way, too.  Forest Whitaker, as the brains of the burglary, provides complexity to a character that might otherwise have been a type; you can't help wishing that he was not a part of the operation.  The camera work (not dissimilar to that of television's ""CSI"") works to increase the tension, although often it comes across as an effect for effect's sake.

Also, like The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Panic Room's promise disappears within minutes and the film turns into a mindless mess. Jodie Foster who's known for masculine, tougher, butch-like roles plays a single mother who's normal boring world goes from ordinary to thrilling in one night. I thought this would be different but once again Hollywood pees on its own leg. We get a bratty, foul-mouthed child ( whose mother allows her to curse right in front of her ), a disillusioned mother and a couple of criminals in the dullest looking house to ever be in a film. The setting is dark and gloomy making the film as boring as watching a corpse rot.  Don't be fooled. The title is wonderful but nothing hooks you in. This is nothing different from a million other films where a woman was trapped in a house with criminals. It's been done for centuries and this is the worst version of anything similar.

But this time whats missing is a truly great story and script. We have seen this basic story before,"" Home Alone"", to ""Die Hard"". Two very different films, but both with the same premise. Our protagonist is trapped in a building with loved ones at stake by a group of theives.
  In Die Hard all the bases are covered in a fairly believable context. With Home Alone we are talking about a comedy, and kid so we have alot of room to play with what could be believable. But here we have a very intelligent adult in Jody Foster a reasonably intelligent teenage girl, and three bad guys. Two of whom aint the brightest bulbs in the box, and one who's got brains, and a decent heart. We know almost from the get go that(as the decent bad guy says) ""Everythings going to be alright.""
 Kinda kills the suspense.
 The acting is good from Forest Whitiker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakem. The teenage daughter of Fosters character played by Kristen Stewart is dead on. And as always Jody Foster is terrific.(Baring very ample and distracting cleavage this goround)
  The camara moves we've come to expect from Fincher are all here on constant display, and the CGI inhancing is flawless.
  The story and script are the problem. In a thriller our protaganist must do the same things we would reasonably do in order to extricate themselves from the situation. That is until the antagonists leave them no option except the extreme. Never happens here.

1712264,3,B00006681E,"Panic Room by David Fincher, I have seen it a couple of times, it's basically another movie involving a heist that goes awry with Foster (Meg Altman) and her daughter Sarah Altman (Kristin Stewart) thwarting the effort of three would thieves into her house.
Of course Fincher doesn't make this a typical heist movie. He adds a bit of paranoid messages into the film making it pretty interesting till the end. For instance, the heist
in question involving the three thieves Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Raul (Dwight Yoakam), and Junior (Jared Leno) breaking into an unbreakable house which has a ''panic room'' (an unbreakable room for emergency). The ''panic room'' is like the 1990's version of the 1950 version of a panic room which paranoid people in that time used because of the so called threat of nuclear war. lol
The dilemna here is that Meg and her daughter are at the house at the same time the thieves are coming in. So Meg and Sarah hide in the ''panic room'' which yes hides the fortune the thieves are after. So while the thieves are trying to break into the panic room, the Altman's are trying to break out of the room (because the room is cutting of oxygen) and to contact the police for help.
Fincher does managed to established a great clautrosphobic ( I think I spelled it right) atmosphere enabling to gasp for our breathes while Meg and Sarah try to conserve their last ones. The lighting of the movie also a certain atmosphere as well, as most of the shots in the movie look dark and gloomy giving us more chills and spills.
The acting is great Jodie Foster does another fine performance in her career, which
I have admired for a long time. Here she pulls of the single mother fighting for
the life of her daughter routine very well. She likes all her other roles, does
gives that tough edge that makes her characters so real.
Kristen Stewart is good too although she doesn't get too many lines.
Forest Whitaker as Burnham and Jared Leno as Junior are the lead thieves who gives some laughs in between especially when these collide with another as to their next plan of attack on Meg.
Burnham is a good character. Whats starts out as a typical thief, turns into a sympathetic character of a thief who perhaps is sick of the life of crime he has led, while Junior represents the most typical violent thief even, someone who continually robs and kills people with no conscience. He is another words like these guys on ''America's Most Wanted'' who gets profiled like a million times, almost taking pride in the fact that he loves being a menace to society
''Panic Room'' by David Fincher is then obviously more than just a heist movie, Fincher puts in some critical factors that prevent from being just a standard crime movie. The characters are different than you would get in a typical movie of this genre. The acting is good, the suspense is good and overall the movie is good.",1082937600,,2898,4.596525096525096

1712268,4,B00006681E,"MOVIE: David Koepp (Who wrote the screenplay) must have been seeking a challenge or something when he decided to cook this morsel up. How do you make a movie compelling when the only setting is a manhattan town home, when the main characters are stuck in one room throughout the majority of the movie, and when there are no major stunt sequences or gunfights? How do you? You get David Fincher to direct, that's how! The movie has the simplest premise yet the movie is tense and entertaining. I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and I kind of though ""what a stupid idea that is"", but I was wrong.  What Fincher did with this movie is made the house a character of its own, the audience sees the town home from almost every angle possible, and the camera never stops.  Most of the shots are CG, but the effect is astounding and without it would make this movie a sleeper.  Fincher is still an amateur in my eyes, but every movie he's done (which is only a few) have been fantastic.  The movie itself is one of the few that will keep you watching not because of the acting or the story but of the camera work, and the audience will never even know it.
VIDEO: The movie is presented in an anamorphic widescreen at a 2.40:1 ratio.  The movie is dark, very dark, and I think the video turned out great. The dark colors come out nicely. I don't see any downgrade from the Superbit version released two years ago. The video was also mastered in High Definition, so if you own a HD set and a progressive scan DVD player then you'll have the benefit. Pretty Good!
AUDIO: The mix is good it's a 5.1 DD, and the sound effects come out sharp and crisp. The real sound is from Howard Shore's subtle score that is highly effective. You can listen to the film in Spanish and French too. Overall sharp and clear and top notch!
PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The set comes in one of the most original box I've seen, and it's great. When you slide out the piece from the slip cover it opens up two flaps and in the center we have three discs one after another in a clear digipak case, and you can flip them like a book. They aren't cheaply made and look pretty sturdy.  As for the extras we get a load of them. The Superbit release two years ago only had a trailer, and that was pathetic.  Now we have one of the most extensive looks into a film ever compiled onto a DVD.  This puppy can be stacked up with LOTR and Pearl Harbor in terms of extras.  On disc 1 we get the movie and the options, and we get three commentaries by the director, stars, and writer.  We also get the trailer and plus a few other trailers for classic movies from Columbia / Tri-star.  On disc 2 we get Pre-Production which consists of 6 featurettes pre-production, interactive pre-visualizations (i.e. storyboards compared with different shots and the final). In Production we get a one hour long documentary on the principal photography, and a makeup effects featurette. On disc 3 we get the second half of Production and in that we have sequence breakdowns.  Then we have the Post-Production section that consists of 21 documentaries and featurettes that focus on post visual effects work, Sound Design featurette, Digital Intermediate featurettes, Musical Score breakdown, and some other minor things.  Overall this one is a whopper, a very well made DVD, worth the money even if you have the original. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this set highly, and if you're interested in film making then I order you to get it cause the ""making of"" doesn't get any better than this.

1712269,3,B00006681E,"Like all his movies, from the satirical ""Fight Club"" to the deep human horror of ""Se7en"" to the could've-been ""Alien 3,"" Fincher's ""Panic Room"" is a conventional thriller loaded with a layer of subtext. Unlike ""Se7en and ""Fight Club,"" however, the plot and characters in ""Panic Room"" can't survive without the subtext, and what we're left with is a slick but unfulfilling little thriller.
Freud would've loved the plot - frightened woman and her frail but tough daughter are trapped in the womb of a house while three would-be robbers (who might as well be named Id, Ego, and Superego) invade the home, seeking the treasure that's secure in the center of the fortress. Wow! Anyway, Fincher has fun with camera moves, funky angles, set pieces, and wonderfully muted colors...unfortunately, every self-conscious shot only magnifies his weakness with character development and true, human fear. Examine the moment when Jodie Foster's character discovers the trio in her house - why is it so muted, when it should be filling her - and us - with terror?
Unfortunately, I suspect Fincher was drawn to ""Panic Room"" as much for its flimsy plot (more of a situation, actually) as its symbolism - the simpler the setup, the more chances to dazzle with nifty camerawork. ""Panic Room"" could've been a nail-biter, but it's only a mildly satisfying thriller, and a waste of most of the actors' talents.",1078531200,,1388,4.96137339055794

""Panic Room"", despite the decent acting and the excellent photography and camera-tricks, doesn`t impress all that much and enters into familiar and predictable ground. It`s a watchable thriller with a couple of twists that kept me entertained for a while, but it doesn`t go beyound that. For the most part, it isn`t too difficult to figure out what is going to happen, and the lackluster ending only makes it worse. Appropriate to watch in a rainy night when there is nothing else to do, since it`s still good enough to kill a couple of hours. A rental, not a keeper.",1074470400,2,679,4.619834710743802

1712276,4,B00006681E,"Let's face it; Jodie Foster does not make bad movies.  Perhaps the greatest actress of her generation, Foster had been MIA while she was birthing her babies, and ""Panic Room"" was a welcome return for this superb thespian.  That being said, the movie isn't without it's problems.  The set-up of the plot is too rushed, and the action itself, while often high-octane, goes on too long to truly be enjoyable. In other words, too little development and too much melodrama.  For fans of the female-driven action genre, however, the movie is actually quite enjoyable, if a bit high-strung.  Foster is, as usual, incomparable, and Forest Whitaker provides his trademark low-key delivery.  Any movie that keeps a mask on Dwight Yoakam for long periods of time can only be a good thing, and he proves here that he's adept at playing incarnate evil.  Jared Leto's performance is surprisingly lacking the thoughtfulness he usually offers, as he seems to do nothing but scream and whine throughout the entire movie looking like he needs a good power-washing.
All and all a decent movie made stronger by Foster's performance.  Recommended as long as you don't go into it with high expectations.",1071878400,,1181,4.959390862944162
1712277,2,B00006681E,"While unintentional I'm sure, Panic Room and the Ben Stiller comedy Duplex share a lot of similar camera angles and site gags dealing with vertical space in New York style brownstone town home etc. Jodie Foster stars as a mother of a pre-teen young girl, both of which are booted by the rich hubby for a trophy wife.  They move into said vertical mansion which has a built in `panic room' used to hide from invaders.  Of course, that's what happens on the first night, Forrest Whitaker and a looking-worse-than-even-Slingblade Dwight Yoakam arrive to steal the millions hidden in the house in the panic room.  Jodie and daughter hide in the panic room, thwarting the invaders attempts.  Almost seems like Home Alone gone bad, and it plays that way for a while until Dwight goes loco and corks one in the third invaders' cranium.  On a side note it saddens me to see his descent from his 80's alternative country heyday.  Anyhow, Forrest must ultimately decide if he's a real bad guy, just as Jodie must go Ripley on Dwight w/ sledgehammer.

1712278,2,B00006681E,"Panic Room is one heavy movie.  Heavy colors, heavy drapes, heavy facial expressions; heavy rain, darkened corners, unfinished walls.  With all that ""atmosphere,"" you'd think we had the beginnings of a frightfully engaging film.  After all, this is a movie about a mother (and a darn good actress, Jodie Foster) and daughter (who happens to be an insulin-dependent diabetic) crammed into a small cement and steel room as some big, bad wolves lurk outside ready to jump.
But all of this lovely set-up is for naught.  Foster's acting is flat, closer to her work in the abysmal Contact.  Sure, we get to see her scientifically enhanced cleavage, but that is about the only thing that is revealed about her character.  One of the problems is that Foster's character is dimwitted and depressed, not exactly a formula for an engaging heroine.  And if Foster is rather dumb, she looks like a genius compared to the bumbling crooks who are trying to steal money from her house.
Panic Room is filled with cliches and marginal performances.  The story is trite and dumb, and simply not worth your time.  Sorry, Jodie.  Try again.",1070064000,,1119,4.842105263157895
1712279,3,B00006681E,"Film 101: a suspense thriller yarn (the genre that ""Panic Room"" whines to belong to) needs to be based around at least a semi-intelligent plot.
That's asking for too much here. A trio of the most severely knuckleheaded crooks you have ever set your eyes on (apart from Home Alone series perhaps, where it was all at least tongue-in-cheek) plan to oust a mom+daughter duo from a ""safe"" room that was created for this very occasion.
That intriguing premise turns into poppycock quicker than you can shut a door. Questions arise at almost every other minute. Without divulging too much:
* Why couldn't the crooks just come some other time when there was no one in the house?
* Why did they choose to be themselves and let all the ensuing hide-and-seek take place? Impersonation doesn't really take so much brains!
* Why did they just not smash the cameras or make up a cock-and-bull story to get access to the safe?
* How did the bad guys know that blowing up a cylinder wouldn't send the entire house in flames, and only have the desired selective impact?
* Why did the mother not bluff about calling the police with a cell phone when they snapped the phone line?
Forget about suspension of disbelief, you've seen teen horror movies with more grey matter.
I won't spoil whatever little value there may be in watching the ""surprise"" ending, but the truth is, highly predictable things happen and get resolved in perfectly imaginable ways -- barring of course the cacophany of the orchestra in the backdrop, which is the only thing that gives you the misconception of watching a thriller. Which this film definitely isn't.
Saving graces? Some clever camera work (it is David Flinch after all) and a couple of tense skip-a-beat moments strewn here and there. That doesn't save the entire movie though.
Probably an OK rental, nothing you'd want to own.",1069891200,2,1846,4.736024844720497
1712280,3,B00006681E,"I couldn't imaguine what could be so exciting about a movie of two people locked in a room. It turned out to be a great edge-of-your-seat thriller. Jodie Foster again demonstrates what a fabulous actress she really is. The film blew my mind away. Jodie Foster was so great in this film. I heard that Nicole Kidman was originally supposed to be the leading role, but she was injured while filming Moulin Rouge so she didn't have enough time to heal and be in Panic Room. I was kinda mad about that but what can you do?
It is a great suspense thriller with many twists, superb acting and wonderful camera work. The ending could be better. There is no surprise. It's quite a simple story - mother(Foster) and daughter are home alone in a big(really big, actually!)house - it's the middle of the night and three burglas come calling, after the contents of a safe kept in the 'panic room' of the house.
Mother and daughter retreat to the safety - or so they hope - of the specially built room, while the three men try various ways to get them out, and mother and daughter fight to generally survive and get help.

The same could be said for this film; just by-the-numbers, lowest-common-denominator Hollywood pulp.  It might also help if the actress who plays Foster's daughter had an actual pulse, too.

1712282,5,B00006681E,"The real star of this movie is David Fincher, the director whose exquisite use of his camera, lighting and atmosphere elevates what could have been nothing more than a variation on ""Wait Until Dark.""  However, Fincher blesses us with a taut, visually stirring suspense-filled thriller.  Jodie Foster plays a recent divorcee who moves into an elegant brownstone with her daughter, played quite well by Kristen Stewart.  One unique feature of the house is its panic room----a room to go if you're house is invaded.  And lo and behold, does it get invaded!  Seems like the former owner left behind some money in a safe--where else, but in the panic room!!!!
The trio of villains, quite reminiscent of those in ""Wait Until Dark"" have their own agenda---henchman Jared Leto (I wanted to cut off his fingers, everytime he used them to punctuate his lines); the security man who installed the panic room (a nice performance from Forest Whitaker); and the obviously demonic Dwight Yoakam, a country singer whose stone-faced evil could be called a rotten performance, but it manages to work because the character is so blatantly heartless.  I, too, had some trouble seeing Jodie's character married to such an older man, and if there is any weakness, it is the lack of any rapport between Foster, Stewart and Patrick Bauchau who plays the unfortunate ex-husband, Steven.  An especially tense, subtly so, sequence is when Foster sends two cops away who have come to answer her husband's phone call.  There is such fierce conflict in Foster's attempts to get rid of them so the two remaining villains won't ice her daughter.
In another vein, I really admired the opening credits, the way the names appeared to be signs on some of the buildings.  Clever, indeed.
Director Fincher has given us two quite exceptional movies--this one and the 1995 chiller, ""Seven.""  Let's hope he continues to do so in the future.

Some of the elements are highly nuanced -- especially scenes like the retrieving the cell-phone.  I would hope that in 25 more years such scenes will continue to work as well as they seem to right now.

1712284,3,B00006681E,"America's sweatheart, Jodie Foster, plays a recently- divorced mother who moves into a huge (the kind you only see in movies) New York City apartment with a ""panic room""-- a self- contained, steel-walled room built for protection in the case of home invasion. Shortly after moving into the new place, claustrophobic Jodie and her strangely androgynous-looking 11-year old daughter get the unfortunate experience of testing the room out, when they're invaded by a trio of robbers. For most of the movie, the invaders try to get Jodie to come out (ahem...), because there's supposedly money in the panic room,left there by the apartment's wealthy former owner. Eventually, Jodie does come out (ahem...), only to face more danger when her daughter, on the verge of a diabetic coma, is now trapped in the panic room with two of the robbers. ""The Panic Room"" is a psychological thriller with Jodie in a role which has become too common in movies lately: the vulnerable, fragile woman who rises to the occasion and gets tough when she or her family is threatened. Jodie is perfectly adequate in the role, but a hundred other actresses could have done just as well. And the movie, while it does have some thrills, isn't exactly the nail-biter that it was hyped to be-- leaving the audience's mind to wander and think about unimportant details...for example, why is Jodie's ex-husband in the movie so blatantly unattractive? Personally I'd like to have seen the tragically underused Ms. Foster in a character that better accentuates her charms: her brains, her matter-of-fact attractiveness, and most of all, her enigmatic persona.

1712285,5,B00006681E,"The Egyptian pharaohs had it right all along; the only way to make your sanctuary, your abode of eternal rest, your panic room truly impregnable and safe is to kill the guys who build it as soon as the job is done.  Of course, you can't go around killing construction and security people willy-nilly, and that leads to the kind of situation we find in this movie.  When the newly-divorced and emotionally scarred Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) manage to barricade themselves inside their new home's super-nifty panic room, they think they are safe from the three guys who have broken into the house.  They are wrong.  The paranoid, rich, recently deceased guy who owned the home before the Altmens had millions of dollars hidden inside a safe in that very panic room; these guys know it, and one of them helped build the darn panic room and safe himself.  So begins a standoff that never flags in intensity or leaves the viewer more than a few precious seconds in which to come up for air.
Meg, despite her claustrophobic tendencies, proves herself to be quite the clever survivor, engaging the bad guys in a mental chess game of ingenuity, desperation, and the type of bravery that can only come from a parent's instinctual necessity to protect his/her child.  It's strange to think that Nicole Kidman was cast to play the role of Meg, bowing out a week or so into the project as a result of some type of injury.  As with any Jodie Foster role, I can't imagine anyone else playing this main character.  I love Nicole Kidman to death, but I think Jodie was much better suited for the part of Meg.  Of course, Jodie can't do everything herself; the movie's overall effectiveness also hinges on the performance of the three bad guys.  Jared Leto is quite good in a weasel sort of way, but Dwight Yoakam was quite unconvincing as the cold and hard ""Raoul.""  Luckily, Forest Whitaker more than takes up the slack to give a performance worthy of a Jodie Foster film.  He is the proverbial criminal with a conscience, and he plays the role extremely well, thereby churning up some additional emotions and feelings in the audience, creating more conflict in one's hopes of final resolution, and ensuring that the audience remains mesmerized in front of the screen until the credits roll.
The DVD heralds itself as a Superbit DVD, which means it optimizes sound and video at a much more impressive level than normal DVDs.  I suppose this only adds to the effectiveness of the unusual camera angles and long camera pans moving from one story of the building to the others in long continuous shots.  I'm just a regular movie watcher, though, so I can't tell much difference in Superbit vs. regular DVDs.  I do know, albeit rather vaguely, that the Superbit technology works by using extra layers of the DVD to encode more technological whatsits and wossnames, extra layers that are often used for such things as extra features.  This helps explain why Panic Room comes with virtually no special features at all, only a trailer for the movie and short filmographies of a few of the actors and filmmakers.  Personally, I'd rather have a commentary and miscellaneous goodies.  Ultimately, though, this movie is so good that it's really all you need to make you happy.  Panic Room is a suspenseful thriller, but it really doesn't make any effort to scare the audience, making this a movie that all sorts of fans can marvel at and enjoy.",1065744000,,3458,4.714285714285714

Basically these 2 people hide in a panic room, when 3 guys come into their house. You find out why they are there, and eventually come to like the black guy as an ally. Rawul is pretty cool too.
I don't want to tell you the whole plot, just that it is enough to make the movie have a point. The sound is excellent. The best thing about it is DTS. DTS was a great addition, and it makes this movie an enjoyable renter. Watch it at night. Its not that much of a thriller but it does do a good job of entertainment.

(The Panic Room's built like a bank-vault.) It also had a 72-hour kit which comes complete with all the the things you'd need in case of an emergency, and an ample-supply of food for sustenance.
The intruders managed to break holes in the concrete walls of the Panic Room, eventually exposing the telephone lines which are vital for communication to the outside world. They ended-up cutting the telephone-lines thereby rendering the phone system in the home useless, to anyone wanting to call the cops to notify them about what's going-on with the dire-circumstances the unsuspecting mother and her daughters found themselves in. ""Panic Room"" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The vigilant mother desperatly-tries to outmaneuver these intruders by doing all she can do, to protecting her prized- assets, by attempting to free herself and her daughters from an imminent-disaster.
The mother and her daughters eventually comes-out of the Panic Room unscathed, from the aforementioned intruders. With the help of friends, and the cop's who show-up way-late to arresting these scum-bags; the timing of the cop's arrival to offer them assistance seems pretty pathetic to me. It's not the best horror-flick I've seen. Because of the paltry action-sequencing, the mediocre special-effects with the dude having earned the dubious-distinction of having survived the initial blows to the face with a sledgehammer, being able to penetrate the concrete-ediface of the Panic Room, by eventually getting shot and killed after many illogical-attempts by his attackers, is why I give this movie ***3-stars***. This movie was hair-rasing and suspenseful, alright. The ""Panic Room"" is rated [R] for: Language, Violence, and Gore.

1712297,4,B00006681E,"Recently divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her teenage daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) are looking for a new place to live, and they decide on a majestic Manhattan mansion. The mansion is unlike anything they've ever seen, but its most distinguishing feature is a secret ""panic room,"" a secure shelter just off the master bedroom.  The room is complete with impenetrable walls, a ventilation system and phone line of its own, and an array of surveillance monitors showing most of the home's interior.
Meg and Sarah settle in, impressed by the panic room but not intending to use it anytime soon. On their first night in their new home, however, a determined trio of robbers breaks in (played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakum), and they won't leave until they get just what they want from the panic room.
Directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"", ""Fight Club""), ""Panic Room"" isn't the most brilliant movie you'll ever see, but it's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Although the idea of an entire movie taking place in one house sounds pretty restricted, Fincher still manages to make it a vastly entertaining film.  The majority of the film focuses on Burnham, Junior, and Raoul (the criminals) trying to lure Meg and Sarah out of the room in order to get what they want there, while Meg and Sarah try to get help from outside sources.  This leads to a relentless assault of suspenseful cat-and-mouse scenes upon the viewer, and the various complications along the way make the film even more fun to watch.
The musical score, composed by Howard Shore (who would later compose the Oscar-winning music for ""The Fellowship of the Ring""), is suitably suspenseful, and the sound effects also work well to increase the film's tension-particularly those of the omnipresent sledgehammer.  But by far, the film's most distinguishing feature is the dazzling camera work.  The camera is almost always moving and often swoops around the house for a bird's-eye view.  This includes zooming into ventilation shafts, downward through the floors, and even straight into a keyhole.  The use of lighting is also effective, as virtually the entire film takes place in the home with a ""dark and stormy night"" setting, so most of the lighting is created with fluorescent lamps.  And, with the addition of a *very* attractive opening title sequence, ""Panic Room"" is surely a visually triumphant film from beginning to end.
The acting is also fairly good, especially considering how cheesy most other films of this genre are.  Forest Whitaker delivers an especially moving performance as the one criminal whom the audience actually learns to like by the film's end.
One of the film's weaknesses, however, lies in the smart but occasionally rough script.  While the criminals are realistic and appropriately unlikeable, their dialogue suffers from a few really corny lines.  Comic relief is understandable in a suspense/thriller like this, but one rather inane scene involves Junior repeatedly slamming a mirrored door while yelling about twenty expletives in a row, which leads Raoul to say, ""That's seven years bad luck.""
What's more significant, however, is the considerable lack of credibility that develops in the last third of the film.  One scene involving an encounter with the cops is rather silly, and doesn't help to explain a later scene when the cops return to the home.  Also, one character seems to have somehow developed bones of steel near the end, as he/she is able to survive a tremendous blow to the head, and then still manage to avoid getting shot several times and then wrestle another character to the ground.  Finally, a third character's fate is not fully explained, as that character is not present in the film's final scene.
Overall, however, ""Panic Room"" is a very fun film to watch, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants good, solid entertainment that won't exactly expand your mind, but also doesn't insult your intelligence like most action films do.  Just be prepared to suspend disbelief for the ending.",1052784000,3,4048,4.983679525222552

This all comes into play when three robbers (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakum) come to get a treasure from the house, that happens to be in the panic room, which the mother and daughter escape to when the robbers come.
Seem interesting?  Yeah, I loved the synopsis, but when I first watched the film, I found it mediocre, slow, and boring.  Then I watched it again.  I loved it.  Sure, it follows the same template of most thrillers, but it held my attention and had my heart racing.  Also, there was some solid, but predictable acting and script-writing.

One of my favorite modern screenwriters, Koepp just seems to 'pump' this one out.  The dialogue is dry and cheesy at points and the plot is pretty plain with no 'real' twists and turns.

1712309,4,B00006681E,"It's finally here, the age where movies are hyped not just for the next pretty star that's in them but for the next serious actor that's in them and for the director's reputation.  In a similar vein to Insomnia, Punch Drunk Love and About Schmidt, the hype surrounding Panic Room surrounded not only its premise but also the question as to whether it would live up to the expectations produced by Fight Club?  The answer is a kind of, which certainly isn't to say that Panic Room isn't a highly efficient, taut genre piece.  It is.  The premise is pretty basic, having Meg (Foster) and Sarah move into a new house after Meg's painful divorce with her husband.  The house contains a so-called 'panic room' where occupants can hide should burglars break into the house, a room that's inpenetrable and completely safe.  Of course, burglars do break in looking for $6 million that is hidden in...you guessed it, the panic room.
It's not really in the premise of the film that you expect Fincher to pull all this off but in the psychological struggle between mother/daughter and robbers.  Given this it's perhaps a pity that the two groups are allowed little interaction bar a few 'get out of my house'-type comments.  In fact, Fincher doesn't veer from the formula much at all.  The obligatory efforts to contact the outside world are all present and intact, although it's a shame that later plot devices are so clearly pinpointed to the audience beforehand that they're not anywhere near as surprising as they could have been.  Take for instance the long take of Meg placing her mobile phone on the charger by her bed, or the explanation of the house's unique elevator system.  The heavyhandedness of this ensures that little suspense is generated when Meg finally realises she has a cell phone about half an hour after the audience does so.  That said, this is a distinctly Fincher picture, something that is nowhere as evident as in the camera work.  Remember the title credits of Fight Club where the camera zoomed outwards from the inside of the brain?  Here the camera zooms across surfaces, through keyholes and up stairwells so effortlessly that there's a real sense of voyeurism built up, and such a nod to classic thriller Rear Window is certainly appreciated.  It's Hitchcock that Fincher truly evokes here, pumping life into a very familiar formula, making a genre film exciting without really moving out of the boundaries of it.  In many ways a comparison can be made to Chrisopher Nolan's Insomnia, which disappointed many as it wasn't as unconventional or groundbreaking as his previous work Memento had been.  Here Panic Room is the lesser partner, but the fact that it isn't as original as Fight Club can't really be said to be a necessarily bad thing.  Of course there are many flaws here but Fincher's style is just so effortless that you should be able to sit back and enjoy the show rather than worrying that this isn't as thought-provoking as you might like it to be.
As for the acting, Jodie Foster again proves what a resourceful actress she is within tight limits, and the girl who plays Sarah is very good indeed considering she's playing a highly stereotyped role of angsty teenage girl.  Jared Leto, playing a completely different role yet again (compare his character here with the ones he played in Fight Club and Requiem For A Dream), shows off his amazing talent in an unsympathetic role compared to Forrest Whittaker's wisely restrained performance as the burglar with a conscience.  Also watch out for a cameo from Nicole Kidman, who was originally cast to play the lead but had to drop out due to a leg injury sustained whilst filming Moulin Rouge, as Meg's ex-husband's new girlfriend on the telephone.
All in all Panic Room is one of the best movies of last year and although it may not deserve any Oscars for originality, it's an intelligently written and nicely character-driven film that despite lack of tension in some areas does manage to develop some suspense when things are up and running.  Never going for the easy option it should be similarly noted that apart from the prologue and epilogue, the camera never leaves the house, leading to an intense claustrophobia that only heightens our panic for the central characters.",1045612800,4,4265,4.807113543091655
1712310,5,B00006681E,"It's embarassing to me how some of ""Panic room"" reviewers enjoy to attack this movie's plot and script. They say: ""Jodie Foster's character should have done this, should have done that, the bad guys didn't notice this and that, there's a plot-hole in this part..."".
I just want to remind them that ""Panic room"" is a FICTION MOVIE. THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REAL. That's what enterteinment is about. ""Panic room"" is a thriller, right? So, in a thriller, the script is written in such a way that the viewers WILL BE THRILLED. Of course, the writers attempt to attain their script to reality as long as they can, but sometimes they have to forsake reality to provide their movie with some parts that will simply be transformed in scenes that will create on the audience the effect they expect.
I just want to know what do reviewers that gave poor rating to this movie on grounds of plot-incredibility think of movies like ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the rings"" and others alike. If they are coherent, they also despise these movies, and all they want to watch are czech-polish movies about the lives of two old seamstresses escaping Lithuania during the second world war (this is an example, I'm not saying that czech movies or polish movies are bad, they just usually are not  action thrillers). What I want to say is, ""Panic room"" is good enterteinment, it's a movie that leaves you with your eyes wide open every scene, and you just want to know what's going to happen next. The acting is excellent, as well as director David Fincher, the action sequences are good... What more could you expect from a thriller? If thrillers were supposed to be real, there would be  a Ferrari-Lamborghini chase through the streets of San Francisco every ten minutes, there would be a terrorist attack in O'Hare airport every hour, a subway-train wreck coming up in Fifth Avenue every week, etc.
Just relax and enjoy ""Panic room"". It's very cool.

1712311,1,B00006681E,"There were so many inconsistencies from what would happen in the ""real world "" versus what occured in the movie.  Case in point:  Foster eventually calls 911.  What normally happens (even though I am not in law enforcement, but happen to watch TV every now and then) is dialed on a land line, the cops will show up, ask for ID and search the house, regardless of why the call was made...it's protocol.  When they do arrive, Foster spends several minutes dissuading the police from coming into the house (for reason's explained in the moview).  Foster's character somehow 'forgot' that although the robbers could see her via the surveillance cameras, they could not hear her.  It would have been decent forshadowing on the writers' part if they had used this as a mechanism on how she eventually saves her family.  Why not just tell the police, ""My family is in a life-or-death situation.  If you enter the house, we die.  So figure something else out on how to help us"" or something to that effect.  She had the ability to relay to them as much info as they wanted, since the robbers couldn't hear a thing.  Unfortunately, the main character was a bit on the dim side.
The main characters' actions were unbelievable, unless she had severe mental disabilities that would prevent her from acting in an even remotely rational way.  Granted they were in a panic situation, they still had many opportunities to call for help.  If you do happen to watch this movie, you may end up asking these questions:  Why hang up on 911?  (note:  911 will arrive, even if it's a crank call).  Why phone your ex-husband and spend precious seconds providing information with no context instead of just screaming out ""We're being robbed!  Call the cops!""?  Also, if you have a cell phone that doesn't work in a room (e.g. the panic room) and yet you're able to exit that room on more than one occasion...why not bring that cell phone out with you and make a call?  You don't even have to step too far.  You can even pre-dial the number and keep your finger on send.

Not only are Yoakam and Leto discordant compared to Whitaker's acting realism, but their characters are right out the formula book.  Leto is the braggart that wants to run things when Whitaker is clearly the intelligent one, and Yoakam is the token loose cannon that Leto brings along unannounced.  The ending is decent, which is usually tough for movies like this.
Having said that, I think Panic Room could become something of a minor classic with two good actors and inventive direction from David Fincher.  Fincher reminds me of the young Brian DePalma who always did well with average material.

The previous owner Mr Perlstien, a wealthy financier, has died, leaving behind disgruntled relatives and a Panic Room ( a safe haven from attackers).
Mother and daughter settle in, to be disturbed shortly afterwards by three men who break into the house. One of them is the grandson of Mr Perlstien who knows that the old man has hidden his loot in a safe in the Panic Rom. Another is a security contractor familiar with the Panic Room. The third is a hired gun, brought along by the grandson without the second man's foreknowledge.
The grandson hadn't reckoned on their being anyone at home, because of the time it should  have taken for the property to change ownership. The mother and daughter escape into the Panic Room, just in time. And the intruders have to get them out, for they have no way to breach the poured concrete, and three-inch-thick steel.
Because this film had gotten such poor reviews I hadn't bothered going to see it at the cinema. But after watching in on DVD, I have to say that I found it to be much better than the reviewers had claimed.

Although the plot is a touch rough around the edges, the film moves along smoothly enough to gloss over these defects. Then again, when you've got Jodie Foster heading up the cast, the defects shouldn't really be there.
Okay ... gripes over with. Go watch it.",1042934400,,1674,4.655405405405405
1712317,3,B00006681E,"I read that Jodie Foster didn't want to do PANIC ROOM, but somehow got caught up in it. The movie does provide much suspense, and although quite ridiculous in some parts, is worthy of a place in any top 20 suspense thriller list. Jodi is excellent in the role of a lady who has purchased a home fitted with a panic room off the main bedroom.  I felt they should have waited before introducing the home invasion - it just seemed too far-fetched to have that happen on her first night in her new home.  It's a minor issue, but it just seemed to spoil it.  It would have been good to build up to it to give the viewer more of a feel for the home.
DVD EVALUATION - Be careful, like many new DVD's, the greedy film companies are bringing out one version, then a few months later another version.  A good example is the new ""Superbit"" version of Panic Room with improved picture quality and more special features.  It's annoying, but if you have the original DVD version you probably aren't missing out on too much.",1042502400,,1009,4.317460317460317
1712318,2,B00006681E,"Panic Room is OK movie, nothing new here, but not that old either.  I did admire the camera work, and the angles that were used on some of the shots.  But, at the same time I found that I was more interested in the camera work than the actually story, which is pretty much none existant.
Set up, mother and daughter move into huge apartment with 50 rooms and 12 stories, and hundreds of video cameras.  Of course, the first night robbers try to break in.  Couldn't it have been a week later at least?  The rest of the movie is pretty unbelievable.  The robbers break in, three of them.  Larry, Moe and Curly.  One is an idiot, one is psycho and the other is a professor of everything.  Long story short, the mother and daughter go into the panic room only to find that that is where the robbers want to go too.  Sadly, the mother forgot her daughter's diabetes meds.  So, while they are stuck on the 12th floor, the meds are on the 2nd floor.  Of course her daughter starts to get low blood sugar.  So, instead of getting out of the room and getting out the window while the robbers are on the first floor, they stay there.  When I asked my friend, why don't they just get out while the robbers are downstairs she said, ""because the door would make a lot of noise and the robbers would know that they are opening the door.""  Wrong, they opened the door and there wasn't a sound at all.  Totally illogical when you know they want to get into the room that your hiding in.  The ending, well it was like the rest of the movie, dumb.  Panic Room is a good rental when you've seen every other movie in the store.  But, really, it's not that great a movie.",1041984000,2,1650,4.214057507987221
1712319,4,B00006681E,"Fans who were disappointed by the filmed adaptation of the novel Sliver will find much recompense in this taut Ira Levinesque thriller. Jodie Foster (at her most assured and compelling in years) plays a newly divorced mother (to Kristen Stewart) who buys a new Manhattan home based on its spacious rooms, many floors and a nifty bedroom feature: a completely secure, foolproof panic room, designed in case of emergencies like burglaries and the like. Foster dismisses the room as a useless novelty, the product of the corrupted mind of the paranoid millionaire who owned the home before she did. Unfortunately, her sentiments obviously fall on deaf karma, since on the very night of her moving in a trio of robbers (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam) break in to her house, thinking the place still empty. Now, mother and daughter are trapped in a well-equipped but tiny little space with no way of escape, hoping that the gentlemen will just take what they want and leave. However, what they want turns out to be in that very room, and just because it's impossible to enter it doesn't mean the bad guys won't try. Tight as all hell, the film is about as scary as any film you'll ever see, directed with incredible precision by crafty David Fincher (The Game, Fight Club), who just seems to be getting better and better at this kind of film every time he tries it. Gorgeously shot by both Conrad L. Hall and Darius Khondji (who was fired during the shoot for having a level of perfectionism that made the film run way over schedule, which in turn was getting in the way of pregnant Foster's growing belly), the film was written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Death Becomes Her), and is safely acknowledgeable as his best script to date. The lead role was originally to be played by Nicole Kidman, who thanks to an injury she sustained while filming Moulin Rouge was unable to fulfill her commitment to this film, prompting Foster to drop out of her duties as president of the 2002 Cannes Film Festival Jury at last minute's notice and take over the role (Liv Ullmann later took Foster's position at Cannes and Foster made a small presentation during the Cannes Award ceremonies). Kidman's voice makes a tiny cameo as the voice of Foster's ex-husband's new wife.",1041984000,4,2270,4.749367088607595

The rest of the movie is filled with the burglars cussing one another because they can't break in. There's also many other plot holes, for instance, when Foster is finally able to call 911, they put her on hold! unbelievable! After the movie ended I hoped for some interesting features on the making of, but nothing. All you get is a trailer and some worthless filmographies.

1712323,3,B00006681E,"Following the huge success of the excellent SE7EN and FIGHT CLUB, David Fincher's latest thriller is perhaps somewhat less impressive than his previous efforts, but there are still some gripping moments in the film that make it worthwhile. The premise provides from some effective boo! scares and shocking twists, but as a follow-up to FIGHT CLUB, this one is somewhat underwhelming. Jodie Foster shows that she's still good when it comes to this genre, and Howard Shore's brooding score racks up the tension. Creepy music is one of the key elements to making films like this scary, and Shore has proven that he can do tense, nail-biting scores (THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) and large-scale adventure (THE LORD OF THE RINGS). Fincher's trademark stylistic M.O is full bore here, with some fantastic visual flourishes. The anti-climactic ending is the only letdown, but it's worth renting out from Blockbuster to witness another notch is Fincher's increasingly impressive style.
The DVD extras are dissapointing, with only trailers. With the popular re-re-release pattern of most DVDs, it would be advisable to wait until a 'Special Edition' comes along.",1040515200,,1150,5.221621621621622

The characters just had nowhere to go.  It was entertaining enough to justify renting, however, and I wouldn't say it wasn't worth watching.
Often the problem with these type of ""premise"" movies is that they just don't have enough to make a full length feature film.  What happens is the audience is expected to accept as possible a bunch of ""why would they do that?"" or ""could that really happen?"" situations and as they pile up they end up making the story too unbelievable.",1039046400,,641,4.5

Afterall, the thugs holding her daughter can't hear what she's saying. And then, not taking the damn gun herself and shooting. Finally, if I see one more ""dead man rising back to life"" in any movie, I think I will throw up. Raoul, who already has a bashed arm and is bleeding quite badly, is smashed over the head with a sledge hammer. That would be enough to do any mortal in. But no, he pops up back to life, full of vim and vigor...well, I wish they might have put a realistic ending on it.",1038009600,4,795,4.566433566433567
1712329,4,B00006681E,"This movie is more action centered than character centered, so one might wonder why a two-time best actress winner was cast in the lead role. Perhaps the answer is that Jodie Foster likes to play some roles of this sort as well as more intense characters of focus. I hope that is the explanation, for if she's doing something she likes to do here, that's fine, not as if she's wasted in roles not so demanding on her talent without her being much interested in them. That said, she and the rest of the cast do quite a sufficient job of doing what the story demands of them. A few things did surprise me about this movie. A minor one was the pervasive mirky darkness of the mood throughout. Seeing occasional light of day or more brightly lit rooms wouldn't have disrupted the needed theme here, but instead the movie dwells in a pervasive darkness that gets a bit taxing. But the main surprise was in plot contrivances. Previews and some reviews I'd heard before seeing it made me expect a movie about how the house's occupants fare in the title panic room during a typical burglary. The title strongly fortified room, supposedly essentially burglary-proof was designed as a retreat to protect occupants during such a home-invasion. I did get some idea before seeing the movie that the panic room becomes more of a trap that a protection. A general weakness of the whole principle behind a panic room? I expected the movie to imply that. But what happens instead is a plot so contrived for making all intentions of the panic room backfire, that no real light is shed on what a help the panic room would or would not be in a more typical burgalry. The story that does happen is interesting, but it's glaring contrivances can leave one wanting a story of how the title room would work in a more routine siege. One learns from previews and/or reviews that the burglary occurs on the first night the mother and daughter spend in their new house. Does this mean they live in a very high crime area, or is it a highly coincidental happening? That was the question that seemed obvious, but in fact the answer is neither. They moved into the house earlier than expected, and the burglars, who knew what valuables were in the house, were targeting it at a time when they expected it to be unoccupied. Why would the previous occupants have left their valuables behind? That is only the beginning of the contrivances. Furthermore the burglar who is the brains of the heist is none other than the designer of the panic room! That's how he knows just what they are looking for and where, and what the logistics of getting there are, for the safe holding the valuables is IN the panic room. That, at least is one aspect of the movie that has a lesson regarding preparedness against burglaries in general, not just this highly contrived one. If you're going to have a panic room and a safe for valuables, don't put the safe in the panic room! That can just make your place of intended refuge the very target of the burglars!",1038009600,12,3009,4.543278084714549

""Home"" is a large, beautiful place in Manhatten which comes complete with a panic room, an inpenetrable place reinforced with steel and guaranteed to keep out anyone who wants to get in.  Of course, someone does want to get in.  Three someones, in fact, are determined to get in and retrieve the millions of dollars they know are locked up in a safe in the room.  Foster and Stewart manage to get into the room when the men break into their house, but the crooks play a game of cat-and-mouse with them, while trying to flush them out.  Foster matches wits with the bad guys while trying to take care of her diabetic daughter and it all adds up to a taut thriller.",1037318400,3,892,4.469135802469136
1712332,2,B00006681E,"The plot for Panic Room would make for an adequate made-for-tv film. However, turning it into a theatrical release stretches the storyline well beyond the breaking point.
A freshly divorced mom and her teenage daughter move into a new house. In the heart of the house is a panic room - a fortified room that is impossible to get into, and provides absolute safety for the occupants. This premise already begins to grind down the flimsy plot.
When three crooks break into the house looking for a specific set of valuables, Foster and her daughter take refuge in the panic room. So all they have to do is wait for the cops to come, right? Wrong. To keep the story moving along another twenty paces, like some desert castaway dragging himself a few more yards to an oasis, the scriptwriter throws in one contrived plot device after another. Why can't the crooks loot the rest of house? Because what they want is in the panic room. Why can't the crooks just tell the girls to hand over the valuables so they can leave? Because the intercom only works one way. Why can't the girls call the police? Because the phone hasn't been hooked up. Why can't the girls just wait out the crooks? Because some life threatening illness occurs.
I assume the director is trying to make the point that the panic room serves as both refuge and prison. But can you really develop a full-length film based on this premise? Why don't the girls hide out in a walk-in closet or a meat locker? Because the title ""Walk-in Closet"" or ""Meat Locker"" just isn't as catchy as ""Panic Room.""
Foster is a bit lifeless, Forest Whitaker does an acceptable job conjuring up sympathy, and the rest of the cast is adequate. The artsy camera maneuvers are interesting for twenty seconds, but is certainly not enough to save this film from the realm of wait-until-its-on-video movies.",1036800000,3,1840,4.647239263803681
1712333,3,B00006681E,"This has just about everything in place as far as expectations going into the movie.  A major star, some recognizable minor stars, a good director, a good premise.  This is the story of a recently separated mother and teenage daughter who buy what has to be a multi-million dollar residence in Manhattan.  It is equipped with something called a ""Panic Room"", which is a fortified room in the middle of the house to protect the inhabitants from home invaders.  The fact that the Panic Room gets a workout right away is the plot of the film.
This film has a lot of things going for it, but doesn't offer us anything that special.  On the good side, we get a trio of believable bad guys of varying degrees of badness.  We get to see Jodie Foster thinking of how to get out of a nasty situation, which reminds us a bit of dueling Buffalo Bob in a dark house in that ""Lamb"" movie.  And we get some plot twists that force here to actually make a truce with the bad guys at a crucial moment.
It's just that there's nothing that is that special.  I suppose if you have a movie called ""Panic Room"", which has a Panic Room, you should use the Panic Room.  Coincidently, they need it on their very first night, which is necessary to the plot, as the fact that it isn't all hooked up properly makes in only a marginally effective device.  And there is a problem with one of the bad guys not being as bad as the other bad guys.  You just know this will be the one that will be turned to for help, and it's so obvious I'm not really revealing anything here.  Finally, why have all the tensions when the final act to solve the issue would have solved it no matter when it came.

It moves.
Jody Foster and Forest Wittaker do their job well here, as do the other actors to a lesser extent, but the movie's nothing special. It's something to stick in the dvd player on a Friday night if you've already seen all the really good movies released lately.
But it does, of course, have Fincher's normal visual flair, which is sort of entertaining in and of itself. The camera work is great.

#1 The Performances. Jodie Foster's in paticular. She brings great depth to her character of a single mom who's as tough-as-nails.
Her daughter also is terrific. Just a tough as her mom and you get the impression that they really could be mother and daughter in real life. Forest Whitaker leads the trio of robbers who for some reason have to get into the panic room where Jodie Foster's character and her daughter hide while waiting for the trio to depart, which they don't intend on doing. Their performances are all more than credible with Dwight Yokam playing a mysterious robber who ends up taking control of trying to get into the room.
#2 The Direction. David Fincher surely does some of his best work here and it is so cool to see the camera zooming into an object then coming out on the other side.
Case-in-point: At one particular scene the camera zooms into the keyhole in the knob of a door, coming out on the other side.
Another has the camera going through an exhaust fan and coming out in a different room. This creates for quite a thrilling sensation.
The story itself is good, a simple enough plot pieced together and while it is quite predictable, it is also a lot of fun just watching it unfold. The ending is twisty enough, and one paticular event even caught me off guard a bit.

The perpertrators are so bland and typical that I was thinking of the thugs in ""Home Alone"" trying to be serious.  Did not recognize Dwight Yokum.

Thanks to all these fine individuals, we are treated to an experiment in articulate camerawork and methodical acting abilities.
The biggest hole in ""Panic Room"" is its plotline. Filled with a couple loose ends and misconceptions (911 would never put you on hold), it's the most noticeable problem with the movie. Like I've said before, the camerawork and acting more than makes up for that.  The dialogue within the screenplay is important, witty, and intense, with excellent performances all around (including the other two robbers Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam; Jodie Foster's daughter Kristen Stewart; and a special cameo appearance by Nicole Kidman).
Unfortunatley, I must not recommend purchasing the DVD. Your best bet is to wait. David Fincher has had a history of releasing his movies with next to nothing in the way of special features. Wait a couple years, and he'll probably release a two-disc special edition like he did with ""Fight Club"" and ""Seven"".

With the possible acception of Jared Leto, everyone was perfect in their perspective roles. Leto chewed a little scenery, but he looks good in his corn rolls. Foster does what she does best, and so does Forrest. Taught and scary with a little black humor thrown in, directed as only David Fincher can, it's sure to please.

1712344,5,B00006681E,"Okay, as some of the negative reviews have pointed out, this isn't quite a thrilling horror flick like the title may suggest.  To fully appreciate this excellent film, one must drop all expectations and presumptions at the door.
Now, ""Panic Room"" is no-doubt a thriller, but it has an unusual dosage of humor and unlikely castings.  Forest Whitaker's soft heart, Jared Leto's comical stupidity, and Dwight Yoakam's impulsive rage are indeed an odd combination for such a film.  Add in the the fact that this is not your typical cat-and-mouse game between a cop and a criminal, and ""Panic Room"" is truely one of the freshest productions to come along in a good while!  Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart handle their roles to a tee, but it is the villians who are the gleaming highlight.  The characters played by Leto and Whitaker both have weaknesses that make them seem almost harmless, allowing for respite from the dramatic action.  By the middle of the film, you'll realize both of them are far from the bonafide, heartless killers you may have intially thought them to be.  Nonetheless, Yoakam makes sure the viewer gets his/her share of shakes and jolts as his homocidal character progressively gets more and more out of control throughout the film.  ""Raoul"" starts off as if he's just a quiet assistant to Leto and Whitaker, but he soon takes control of the scrape with his quick instincts and cold-blooded decisions.
Overall, ""Panic Room"" doesn't contain the all-out viciousness, nor the head-scratching mystery that most thrillers live and die by.  In place of this is a creative plot and some very interesting character interaction.  The script is sharp, not wasting any time on narritives or character backgrounds. Finchner's fast-moving camera work is the icing on the cake that makes this a fine thriller.  ""Panic Room"" is smart, quick, and is sure to keep you glued!

1712345,3,B00006681E,"This movie is none too terrible, as it is none too great.  So there it is in the middle with nothing really to make it stand out from the crowded genre of suspense thrillers.  After director David Fincher has delivered such unique twisted tales shot in a highly stylized manner such as ""Seven"" and ""The Game"", we expect a little more out of ""Panic Room.""  But what really stands out from this movie is not so much the acting, plot, or mood, but instead a cool special effect in which the camera moves the viewer from room to room and gives you this quick glance at the space in between walls.  It's a grabbing omnipotent filming technique that gives you a sense of the house as a character.  But the fact that the movie highlight was a special effect is a telling hint at the overall impression of the movie itself.
For the most part the acting is good.  We get quality Foster as she seems to have a strength for this type ""strong woman in a tense situation"" roles.  It is a good thirty minutes into the movie before it strikes you that Kristen Stewart is playing a girl instead of a boy, strong performance nonetheless.  Forest Whitaker needs a bigger role.  Dwight Yoakam is menacing, but we get some pretty egregious offenses of overacting by Jared Leto playing the character Junior.  In fact it got on my nerves from the next room hearing his over-pronunciation, over-reacting, over-everything over the sound of a very loud microwave popping very loud popcorn, but alas it wasn't enough to drown out Leto's ""sledgehammer over the senses with no nuance"" performance.

For one thing, I personally didn't find it very suspenseful, I mean, two women (Well, Jodie Foster and a female Edward Furlong look-alike) being victimized by three men, you know that the women will win for the cause of being politically correct. Also, the villians (aside from ""Raoul"" played by Dwight Yoakam) weren't very threatening at all, just wanting to get into the room to get some money and scare the girls out. Jared Leto is almost unrecognizable in this movie. Half way through I thought to myself ""Hey, wasn't Jared Leto supposed to be in this movie?"" then finally I caught on that he is playing the corn-rowed leader, Junior. Forest Whitaker plays the least threatening one of them all, reminding me more of Carl Winslow from Family Matters than a criminal. The story is: Meg Altman, a divorced mom (played by Jodie Foster, who is always excellent) and her daughter (believe it or not, it is not little Eddie Furlong, but a newcomer by the name of Kristen Stewart) move into a giant house that was formerly inhabited by a paranoid shut-in. Within the house is a virtually unpenetratable safe-room with a phone line, known as the ""panic room"" where the home-owners can hide from invaders and call from help, unharmed. The room seems sort of pointless until the major plot-point comes into play: There are millions of dollars hidden under the floor of the panic room, and three intruders enter the house, not knowing that two people just moved in, with intents on grabbing the money. Of course, Meg notices the three men and her and Sarah quickly hide away into the Panic Room, causing one major problem for the intruders: They can't get the money. They try dilligently to get the girls to come out and resort to all sorts of weird tactics to try to drive the girls out. However, as things go wrong, tensions start rising, and well, I'll let you see the rest. The reason why I didn't like this movie is because of it's limited plot. This movie is what it looks like. There is nothing hidden under the surface and there is no underlying message. All this movies come across as, to me, is a 2 hour-long, spiffed up version of MTV's ""Jackass"" with the intruders trying odd stunts to draw the girls out of the room. Also, the ending, which I won't ruin for you, was extremely weak and anti-climactic. After viewing movies like Se7en and Fight Club, I expected another high-quality flick from Fincher. However, this movie is basically just recycling the odd camera techniques used in both of those films, and if you pay attention, you will notice that all of the ""impossible shots"" are computer generated. The DVD is also very weak, I had seen all these commercials for the DVD announcing this new ""Revolutionary Superbit Encoding Process"" feature, and now I realize, I have no idea what that is. Does anyone? This DVD doesn't look or sound any better than other DVDs. What makes this so special?
Overall, I suggest you check out other David Fincher films. He is a man whose name is synonymous with quality. However, everyone has that one bad film, and this is his.",1034553600,6,3378,4.659966499162479
1712347,4,B00006681E,"For most of us our home is our castle, our refuge, our sanctuary. The place we go at the end of a hard day to relax, to sleep, somewhere safe and warm but at the back of our minds is always the fear of this sanctuary being compromised and our peaceful existence being shattered.
This is the backdrop for David Fincher's latest dark and claustrophobic movie thriller `Panic Room', where single mother (Jodie Foster), recently estranged from her very rich husband, moves into a dark but rather opulent five-storey brownstone on West 94th Street on the upper west side of Manhattan, with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Apart from (surely) being too big for only two people to live in, the house comes complete with its own elevator, CCTV and an impenetrable panic room; somewhere safe to hide should the house ever be invaded. And of course inevitably on their first night in their new house that's exactly what happens and mother and daughter have to seek sanctuary in the aforementioned rather claustrophobic room. But here's the rub, what the robbers (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam) want is in the panic room and the emergency insulin shot that the daughter Sarah urgently needs is outside the panic room, and so begins a battle of wits. with Meg and Sarah's desperate attempts to attract help, whilst the criminals (in between squabbles) come up with plan after plan to drive them from their seemingly impenetrable sanctuary. As Sarah's diabetes starts to send her into a hypo-glycaemic shock, Director Fincher (Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club) expertly cranks the feelings of danger urgency and claustrophobia up notch by notch.
Although it would be fair to say that the cast of conventional characters are more than familiar; the gutsy mother and her rebellious daughter, the kindly first-time criminal (Forest Whitaker), the big-mothed idiot (Jared Leto) and the vicious psychopath (Dwight Yoakam), it must also be said that all the actors concerned bring depth, subtlety and believability to their performances, lifting their characters above and beyond stereotype. However, it is David Fincher's innovation backed up by his cinematographers, Conrad W Hall and Darius Khondji, which lift this movie above the average and ordinary, as in (what appear to be) unbroken shots, the camera swoops from room to room, down stairwells, up to skylights, along air ducts and through walls. All in all Panic Room is probably Director Fincher's most conventional film to date and certainly not as ground-breaking as Fight Club or Se7en or as clever as The Game but it is still a very enjoyable thriller, which bears many of his very dark and edgy hallmarks. If you like a good thriller in the tradition of Hitchock's Rear Window, this one is definitely for you!

The break-in occurs, in this case by the desperate trio of the grandson of the former occupant played by Jared Leto, his more than anxious friend, Dwight Yoakam, and the security expert with the treacherous insider's knowledge who has built and installed panic rooms for other wealthy and paranoid clients played by Forest Whitaker
For two hours, we watch Jodie Foster outthink and try to out manuever these intrusive interlopers while pushing aside her own anxiety regarding her recent breakup and her diabetic daughter's not-so-silent adjustment to her new status in her father's life.

Jodie Foster's character evolves before our eyes, from a vulnerable woman whose marriage has just ended to a protagonist determined to protect her daughter at all costs.  The three ""burglars""--dangerous men who want what's inside the ""Panic Room""--are masterfully played by Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto.  Indeed, Whitaker's character, whose fragile sense of compassion and decency is so instrumental to the end of this film, is particularly compelling.

1712354,4,B00006681E,"Like all of David Fincher's movies, ""Panic Room"" is more a study in cinematic style than it is cohesive storytelling. And while ""Panic Room"" lacks the surprising twists and turns of ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club"", it still succeeds as a standard suspense movie, with Jodie Foster carrying it further with her usual charm.
The story is simple enough: Forster, a recently divorced mother, moves into a spacious Manhattan house with her teenage daughter (Kristen Stewart). The house is huge, with one unique feature, a ""panic room"", which is a self-contained safe room where people can retreat if something goes awry. Well, as luck would have it, something does go awry on their first night. A gang of burglars break in, assuming that no one's there. The gang is your typical stereotype: ""The Nice One"" (Forest Whitaker), the ""The irrational one"" (Jared Leto), and ""The Psychotic One"" (Dwight Yoakam). So Foster and her daughter retreat to the panic room and lock themselves in. Here's the twist: What the burglar's want is in the panic room.
Nothing special, but for some reason, it works quite well. Many people have called ""Panic Room"" a violent, adult version of ""Home Alone"", but I think this movie deserves better. The writing is very well done, considering the mundane subject matter. The acting is first rate, with Foster doing her most believeable performance in years. Personally, I think she can make any movie good. David Fincher, ever the master of stlye, does some neat camera tricks, and the movie is kept interesting by the dark atmosphere. If you crave suspense, this movie will definitely please you. It has more than it's share of moments.
The DVD hails from the ""Superbit collection"", which boasts impeccable picture quality, but it's relatively light on the extras. There are no featurettes, no documentaries, no commentary, and no deleted scenes. Fincher's movies are so interesting that you crave the extras after you see them. I have no idea why they consider scene selection, language selection, and interactive menus to be ""Special Features"", since they are the industry standard. My guess is that there will be a special edition of ""Panic Room"" coming out sometime in the near future.",1033344000,3,2205,4.994565217391305

Even more shocking was that Jodie Foster pried herself out of the director's chair to act in a movie that wasn't powerful or thought provoking in any way.  There weren't even any striking special effects to keep me mildly amused.  It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's certainly not the best either.",1033257600,,494,4.51685393258427

1712357,5,B00006681E,"There are very few films where your mind is racing to work out what's going to happen next. Panic Room does this cleverly.
The film engages the viewer and makes them think about what they've just seen. It doesn't just come right out and explain everything to the viewer.  The film challenges its viewers to pay attention and realize the significance of what they saw.

An example is the shot of the daughter's Refrigerator in her rooom. If you're clever and paying atttention you immediately undertstand it's significance. It may become clear when Jody warns her daughter not to get too excited. Or later notice the daughter's unusual ""watch"". More clues when her daughter warns her mom she's getting hungry...
Finally, the fridge's significance finally dawns when Jody frantically looks through the boxes after the daughter's watch has gone off.
Ok, so the viewer's suspension of disbelief kinda dips when Jody reaches in the vent for the telephone wire and it's marked right there inside the vent. Would a phone line really be marked there?  And all that work Jody does to get back to the refrigerator and she gets the wrong item but the movie makes it out to be the correct one.  But the rest of the movie is so good it doesn't detract from the film's enjoyment even if it is noticed.
The shot of jody crying in the tub and gulping down a huge glass of wine.
The shot of the key in the front door going in and then out.
No explainations or dialogue. Just shots of things that actually mean something significant to the story telling.
The cinematography is likewise clever. The shot of the camera going through the kitchen table, the floor, the vents are just ways the film's technology frees itself from the fixed camera (much as the director of the Matrix proclaimed it would). It's just another enjoyable element in the film and more importantly, it still serves as a purpose to the story telling (unlike the Matrix, whose cinematography was mainly about oohs and ahhs).

1712358,4,B00006681E,"Claustrophobic. That's one way of describing this one set thriller. I wasn't a huge fan of director David Fincher at all when he first came out. Didn't like ""Alien 3"", ""Seven"", or ""Fight Club"". Things changed when I saw ""The Game"". And now, there is this. ""Panic Room"" is a fine, stylish, suspenseful thriller that is worthy of your night's entertainment. All future thrillers should take note of David Fincher's(and M. Night Shyamalan's)work. Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a single mom with a young daughter named Sarah(Kristen Stewart,who I originally thought was a boy when I first saw the trailer for this. Woops.). She and her daughter move into a spacious new place in Manhattan. The place is gigantic. Through the tour, they learn of a secret room in the main bedroom called a 'panic room'. It's a safe place to go too when someone breaks into your house, or to keep things. The girls' first night in the new house is interrupted by the intrusion of three burglars. The three are expertly played by Forrest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and country superstar Dwight Yoakam. Meg discovers them and her and Sarah race to the panic room just in time. The two females are not out of harm's way because what the burglars want is in that very room. Meg and Sarah try to think of everything they can do to get help, and to keep the burglars from somehow getting into the room. The camera work is absolutely amazing. Right from the beginning of the film where you see the opening credits look as if they were part of the New York landscape, you know this movie is going to be interesting. Not to mention look interesting. The wonderful camera work continues through the rest of the film. It passes through walls, floors, keyholes, drain pipes, lightbulbs. It looks amazing. The screenplay by David Koepp is sharp and tight and never wanders. Keeps it real. The mood and setting is supposed to be dark, like most Fincher works, and this one is no different. The setting is part of the cast in a way and Fincher knows how to film it. The actors are all great. Jodie Foster proves once again why she is one of our best, most versatile actresses, and why we like and respect her so much. Plus, she looks amazing in this. Kristen Stewart, as Sarah, was pitch perfect casting. She looks like she could actually be Jodie's daughter. She is real. Very natural. Our three burglars are just as good. No one will look at Dwight Yoakam the same way ever again after this. He's mean, nasty, and creepy as hell. You won't be able to listen to ""Guitars And Cadillacs"" again without picturing him with a sledge hammer. Jared Leto sprouts corn rows here and it isn't pretty. He's the lesser of the two, but he still does an admirable job. Forrest Whitaker is his usual solid self. And, of course, there always seems to be a nicer one in a trio of bad guys. This is one of the better thrillers I've seen in a long time. It plays this drama out in front of you and feel like you are a part of it.

1)The Game and Fight Club are by the same director and I own them as well. Both are among my top 5 movies...
2)This movie was originally released as a superbit release
3)All these reviews giving the movie a 4 or 5 star rating.
Unfortunately, I just had a slew of people over to view it in DTS on a big screen WEGA TV and it was lacking alot of what I saw in Fight Club and The Game. The movie was not a suspense film. When compared the Signs and the Sixth Sense, I would almost say there was no suspense at all. I recognize the movie as a thriller. The forever passionate Jodie Foster did have her moments in the film, but the score didn't seem matched with the acting. It's like the composer wasn't even watching the movie while they were recording.
There were alot of inconsistencies in the film. While it was noted in several scenes how much noise a footstep made in a largely empty wooden house, there were other scenes where a burgler would drop a heavy object or bag and no one heard it. I mean Jodie's awake, lying in bed and there isn't any other noise at all. At least a thud would be heard a few floors up, let alone the sound of normal and slightly raised conversation.
...In the end, it was agreed upon that the great film we bought before renting wasn't that great ...Hope that helps some of you out there who are Superbit supporters as well as Fincher. Almost forgot....the case was definately substandard.",1033171200,2,1529,4.331010452961673

I am taking this opportunity to lower your expectations of this movie in hopes that if and when you see this movie, you may be able to salvage your viewing experience.
Panic Room begins with a mother (Jodie Foster) and her daughter hunting for a new apartment as the product of a recent divorce.  They are reeled into buying the townhouse that becomes the center of the movies' attention.  Along with an extensive security system, this house also comes equiped with it's very own ""panic room""...a highly sucure room used in cases of emergency.  To make a long story short, some burglars break into the house and try to steal a load of money that happens to be hidden in the ""panic room"".  The mother hears the ""HomeAlone-esque"" criminals bumbling around in the house, grabs her daughter and hides out in the ""panic room"".
The rest of the movie is comprised of the burglars attempting to break into the ""panic room"" and Jodie Foster failing to convincingly play the part of a concerned mother in a desperate situation.
All in all, stay clear of this movie unless you are deathly bored or have seen all the other better movies that are out.

Since there are a ton of reviews already, I'll spare you the plot summary. Suffice it to say that Jodie Foster's claustrophobia needed to be way more evident and spotlighted throughout the movie. I needed to feel trapped in the panic room, as they did, or else the basic premise falls through a bit. The dialogue between the thugs was pretty amusing, but it distracted a bit from the ladies in the room. The director did some very . . . interesting? . . . visual things with wires going through walls, following the elevator as it progresses up or down, and a 90 degree camera shift as Foster lies in bed. While they were . . . interesting (?), they didn't make up for the lack of substance to the plot or the lack of ""claustrophobia"" in the movie itself. The director also used sound, or lack thereof, very effectively--one of the best scenes is virtually silent, which doesn't always work. This plot and storyline had a ton of potential, but I don't think the director or screenplay writer capitalized on it. The basic premise is very interesting, and the break-in works, but the events of the next few hours and the ending both shortchange the potential that exists.
The DVD itself was a waste, too. There were absolutely no extras (interviews, making-of, deleted/extended scences)--nothing. They might have helped a little. You might as well buy the VHS version or wait for some kind of expanded, extended, or deluxe version if you want anything other than just the movie. It didn't hold up by itself.
Jodie Foster was fine, but I think her role could have been written much better to capitalize on her incredible acting skills. Forest Whitaker was very good, considering the dialogue he had to work with, and his character was marginally compelling, even with the hokey ending (sorry). Dwight Yoakam was laugh-out-loud funny when he first appeared (I think that was good), but he was turned into somewhat of a joke by the end (did they need to make him look like Michael Keaton in BEETLEJUICE in his final scene. . . ?). The daughter was fine, the father/ex-husband seemed like an idiot, and the other thug was kind of amusing until his departure (do we want our thugs to be amusing?).
Bottom Line: somewhat inconsistent potential and delivery. Performances were inhibited by the screenplay and were also inconsistent throughout the movie. I've seen worse, but I expected much better. Rent it before you buy it. . . .",1032998400,2,2550,4.6815144766147

1712363,2,B00006681E,"Jodie Foster plays an embittered divorcee establishing her new residence after what we are to presume was a acrimonious divorce. The opening scene has a friend encouraging her to buy an obviously expensive home in New York city - because ""he can afford it"". And we also learn it is her intention to go back to Columbia University. One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits.
Enter the men. Three thieves. All, naturally of course, lacking enough collective cerebral power to exit the house on finding it is occupied and coming back at another time. The only motivation to staying is possibly that they were aware of the mother's vocation as a silver spoon divorcee and knew that her schedule between tennis lessons, random weekends in the country, classes and cappuccino would be unpredictable. So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh?
Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society. Body count? All men - two dead, one captured, and one hospitalized (guess who?). Theft and Divorce karma are obviously very gender specific phenomena.

Some reviewers have criticized many of the ""excessive"" shots as the ""camera"" zooms through floors and ceilings to follow action as thieves break into the house owned by a woman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter. But when you have a film that takes place in a confined setting, the visual tone of the film is often lifeless. Director David Fincher used the ""camera"" to capture impossible scenes of roaming through walls to help visually tell the story. And isn't that what the film media is supposed to do? Tell stories primarily through visual images?
But the visual style, while perhaps the most prominent, is by far not the heart of this film. What makes this film beat is the terrifying suspense as this woman and daughter find themselves trapped inside a ""panic room"" with murderous thieves trying to get in.

1712368,4,B00006681E,"of excellence you've come to expect from Director David Fincher.
Panic Room has been transferred to DVD using Superbit technology, and the DVD visuals and sound are superb.  Fincher  used stunning camera work to capture the almost malevolent feel of the house that luckless mom, Jodie Foster, purchases in Manhattan, following a divorce from her powerful husband.  The room in question, upstairs in the house, has been built for a siege, of solid concrete and steel, with survival contents and surveillance cameras.
Meg, Foster's character, has a teenage daughter, Sarah (Kirsten Stewart in a superb performance).  They are lucky to awake and get to the panic room on the night that three intruders invade the house.  Unfortunately, the intruders know more about the secrets held in the Panic Room than do Meg and Sarah.  The home invaders (Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam and Forest Whitaker) are an unlikely bunch, and their unfortunate partnership leads to several mishaps in their quest to unglue the women from the Panic Room, in order to obtain the fortune that lies hidden there.  Because they seem to be bunglers (and perhaps because Leto & Yoakam are miscast), viewers are shocked at the speed and nature of the violence that occurs.
Billed as a suspenseful thriller, Panic Room has its moments of suspense, but tends to disappoint as the action drags.  The brilliant filming holds your attention, and Foster is in her element as a strong woman who will fight to defend her daughter, no matter what the cost.  I think the screenwriter was unable to create the suspense the setting and the players deserved, and so instead, the viewers have several ""why did they do that....they're so stupid!"" moments.  You didn't see those moments in Hitchcock films, because he knew how to deliver suspense in a way that had you living it with the character, not able to spot actions that would lead to disaster.  Definitely worth a viewing, Panic Room may be more of a rental film than one you want to add to your collection.",1032739200,2,2014,4.87683284457478

Sceptical, I viewed this movie to be entertained with some of the action of a hunted down pair innocent of wrong doing and misunderstanding.  The story lacks a bit of creativity and has basically half-witted criminals trying to get inside a secret room in the house that contains bonds worth a fortune.  The exploding propane gas-scene was probably the best, though this movie didn't seem to have enough action as there were very little scenes.  With little scenes I would have preferred more drama and acting, but that didn't come through enough for me.  Is this a great Jodie Foster movie?  No, there has been better that she has done, but has some good suspense which makes it interesting at times.  3 Stars!",1032652800,2,826,4.734265734265734
1712370,3,B00006681E,"My opinion of ""Panic Room"" was adversely affected by my high expectations of it. It was directed by David Fincher, the man behind two of my favorite movies - ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"". It stars Jodie Foster, who was so incredibly good as Agent Starling in one of the great thrillers, ""Silence of the Lambs"". The co-stars are three of my favorite actors - Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakum. In the hands of a lesser [or lesser known] director and crew, this might have seemed like a first-rate thriller. For Fincher and company, though, this strikes me as a second-tier work.
Meg Altman [Foster], recently divorced from a very wealthy man, buys a posh townhouse in an exclusive Manhattan neighborhood. The eccentric previous owner had a 'panic room' installed off the master bedroom. Encased by concrete and steel, the room is impervious to intruders. Altman and her young daughter think of the unusual room as nothing more than a conversation piece. They think again when the house is broken into by three men on the very night they move in. They escape into the panic room just in time, only to find that what the men want is in the room itself. The ensuing cat and mouse game resembles a game of chess played by very determined adversaries.
The movie is technically brilliant - so much so that I found myself more interested in the set design and the camera work than in the story itself. That's because the script didn't work for me. I know thrillers rarely have a great deal of logic to them, but this one seemed especially absurd. For example, when one of the thieves takes a sledgehammer to the ceiling below the panic room, I wondered why a neighbor didn't call the cops. This is a townhouse in a quiet part of New York, after all, not some isolated mansion.

She obviously buys the home and we see them moving in.  She and her daughter are clearly still very distraught over the divorce.  As one of life's ironic rewards for her new home purchase, she gets three burglars on her first night in the new house.
From the moment we see the burglars coming into the home is one of the most suspenseful movies that I've seen in a long time.  Jodie Foster again shows the definition of an actress.  Forest Whitaker, what else can be said about him, he's one of the best.

1712376,3,B00006681E,"Thankfully in Panic Room David Fincher has abandoned doing a bad rip-off of Tarantino & instead does a decent take on Alfred Hitchcock.  Even the opening credits where the titles are superimposed on various New York City buildings bring to mind the credits sequence of North By Northwest. This is straight ahead storytelling, without any bad sermons and Fincher has made a better film for it.
The plot follows a woman and her daughter as they move into an elaborate New York Townhouse/Brownstone combination (so the realtor tells us in the beginning) previously owned by a wealthy, paranoid recluse.  This old man was so fearful of burglars that he had built a small panic room into his bedroom for security.
Three burglars break into the house and drive the mother and daughter into the panic room where they then engage in a battle of wits against each other.
David Fincher has yet to make a movie which did not require a bit more of a suspension of disbelief than most other movies in a similar genre.  Panic Room is no exception.  I would immediately compare this film to Rear Window and Wait Until Dark, but inferior to those masterwaorks.  There are ways in which the villains torment the heroes which seemed a stretch, as well as the rather hokey inclusion of some disabilities for the heroes.  The mother, it is implied early on, is claustrophobic.  However this is only mentioned early on in the film and never brought up again.  A bit later it turns out that the daughter is diabetic.  A plot contrivance to make it necessary for the mother to try to sneak out and get the daughter's medicine.
So try to push past that stuff, enjoy the elaborate camera angles, turn off your brain and be glad that this isn't a David Fincher movie where you also aren't getting a meandering sermon.",1032393600,3,1791,4.660317460317461

I really didn't think that a movie set up entirely in one house would be able to maintain my interest throughout. But it did.
The film works on many levels, with fine performances, an intelligent script, and adroit directing. I particularly liked the strength and resourcefulness of the mother and daughter characters who, in a less capable production, might have been written and played merely as victims. This is much more interesting and engaging when the would be victims are capable of resisting (not with unrealistic martial arts skills) but with thoughtful attempts to thwart the bad guys who are not just ""central casting"" bad guys, but interesting characters themselves",1032134400,8,1285,4.867579908675799

The story and the characters are very straight foward, but any viewer should know what they are getting into based on the movie's title alone. Like Hitchcok, Fincher takes a minimilist idea and blows it out of the water: the movie's entire setting is confined in one house, but what the director does visualy creates the most beautiful intensity that has what Fincher has established as a directoral style. This is a movie that will speak to anyone who appericates natural lighting cinematography and direction with excellent performances from everyone, including the kid (who sucsessfuly walked the fine line of being a brat type character, but one you still didn't want to die.)

The fact that Kristen Stewart was not given the critical praise she deserves says less about her performace but far more about the general public's ignorance of the diabetic condition (and the ignorance of most film-goers and film critics).  Stewart's was a trailblazing performance, as important as any that has been given by an actor playing a debilitating illness in recent past (Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, among them).  Fincher handles the most important scenes with great sensitivity and, of course, they are beautifully and accurately written by Koepp.  The rest of the movie, don't get me wrong, is also quite good--I would say one of the better movies that has been seen this year.

The house features a ""panic room"", especially designed to keep intruders out. It is not long before they will be able to test it. During their first night in the house, three intruders, led by Forest Whitaker, not knowing that the house is already inhabited, are trying to get in. Foster and her daughter realize that the only chance for them to be safe from the intruders would be to lock themselves in the ""panic room"". What they don't realize though, is that what the intruders are looking for, IS in the ""panic room""...
There were two main reasons for being eager to see 'Panic Room':
a. Jodie Foster. Having read the main points of the plot, I really thought that it would provide her with the opportunity for a performance equal to the one she gave in 'Silence of the Lambs'.
b. David Fincher. Starting from 'Seven', I have really enjoyed his filmography and there was no chance I would miss his latest work.
I was not mistaken. Foster and Fincher are surely up to the task. But they represent the two major -if not, the only- reasons to watch 'Panic Room'.
(OK, let's not ignore the always likable Forest Whitaker, who, as always, plays a likable character in a likable manner)
Panic Room is not a bad movie. But for me, it represents more of a lost opportunity.
How can a movie with such great ingredients (Foster+Fincher) in such important posts (main role+direction) miss?
The answer is simple. Screenplay. The main idea is there, but overall, the story is rather weak, with few original twists.
I am really looking forward to the next collaboration of Fincher and Foster, hoping that the result would be closer to the high expectations I have from both of them.",1026691200,3,1811,4.6802507836990594
1712395,5,B00006681E,"Every so often a an off-the-wall director plays it straight. Sometimes it blunts their edge, like Robert Altman's Grisham-by-numbers adaptation of The Gingerbread Man. Sometimes it produces an entrancing oddity, like David Lynch's The Straight Story. However it sometimes brings out the best of the director, and Panic Room is a massive example of this, showing David Fincher's class through and through.
The story revolves around Meg, a recent divorcee who moves into a cavernous property in Manhattan that looks for all the world like the dream property to take care of her daughter. However on their first night in the house a trio of burglars break in and a stand-off ensues with Meg and daughter trapped in an impenetrable bunker in the middle of the house (the titular Panic Room) and whilst the burglars trying to get in to access a hidden safe.
It is the greatest credit to the cast, writer and director that a stock genre situtation is shown in such a fresh and vital light throughout. From Forrest Whittaker's compromised morality to Jared Leto's drug addicted craziness each role seems so real it would be an injustice to attempt to describe them in a few lines. These are not characters, these are people and people can only be defined in a few sentences by a great artist, and here there is definate evidence of greatness at work.
However where the film finds real depth is in the character of Meg. After Nicole Kidman withdrew because of injuries sustained during Moulin Rouge, Jodie Foster was brought in and the character of Meg toughened up and made less glamourous. This change in the character opens up completely different areas of the film. With the absent husband / father having left for a young model, Kidman would have lent the film an air of rejected fragile beauty being slowly crushed before finding her inner strength. A classic tale of having to reach the bottom to find a way up.
However with Foster's tougher screen personna we have a battle of the rejected woman trying to re-assert her ability to function in the world alone as stronger as she did before and determined to lose no diginity along the way. The trio of intruders become like phantoms of her husband whilst her claustrophic fear of the Panic Room mirrors her fear of this strange and new world closing in around her. Given the trust of writer and director, Foster lets her body do all the acting and gives a master class in showing how dialogue should illustrate everything the character isn't saying.
Fincher's visual style builds on Fight Club, even from a credit sequence that recalls North By Northwest but stands on its own in invention and execution. The whole film seems to be shot in a new form of 3D where every object seems perfectly natural, but with heightened depths, as if you were admiring the craftsmanship of a perfectly rendered computer simulation, but without being able to see any flaws. This works perfectly in the claustrophobic confines of Panic Room where the viewer is drawn into each room of the house and left standing next to the protaganists.
Despite featuring a couple of scenes which will have you screaming at the screen because of the characters stupidity to do the sensible thing, it is hard to find fault with David Koepp's taught script. However without Fincher's obsessively bleak vision to give it an edge Panic Room would have been another slick forgetable thriller, instead it is classic film-making that truly deserves the title of 21st century Hitchcock.

The suspense wasn't there because you expect something funny to happen and the cg (computer graphics) was WAAAAY over-done. If you take out the cg you'd be left without the house. That's kinda dissappoining.
But the acting was nice though. Especially coming from Jared Leto. This film is mainly about the characters, and after establishment (which always pops back and forth for more) you have the actions taken.
David Finch's style is fine and is greatly shown in this film and like I said before, there was too much cg. This film doesn't even need any.

Jodie Foster has come a long way since starring in those Disney films ""Candleshoe"" and ""Freaky Friday"". Having been nominated for four Academy Awards (1977 for ""Taxi Driver"", 1989 for ""The Accused"", 1992 for ""The Silence of The Lambs"" and 1995 for ""Nell"") and winning twice (""The Silence of The Lambs"" and ""The Accused"") she is a versatile actor who has shown that she can hold her own against the best of them. Since her last nomination she has decided to take time and make a movie every other year. This is her first movie since 1999's ""Anna and The King"" which failed to ignite at the box office. ""Panic Room"", directed by David Fincher (""Alien 3"", ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"") is a look at what happens when your first night in new surroundings becomes a chilling battle for survival. Meg Altman (Foster) is a single mother with a daughter (Newcomer Kristen Stewart) who has just finalized a divorce from a pharmaceutical big shot. Now she and her daughter are looking to find a place to live. They settle on a quaint New York brownstone with three floors. The place is everything they need and more. There is something else that it has that puzzles Meg. You see the original owner was paranoid and never thought you could be too safe so he had a secret room put in the apartment. That room is known as a ""Panic Room"" and features virtually everything that you would need should you ever find yourself confined to that room. As Meg and her daughter settle in for the night, they have no idea that three murderous thieves (Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto) are intent on getting into the house and obtaining a cache of money hidden in the house. Fleeing to the Panic Room mom and daughter try to get the thieves to leave but they are not easily persuaded and when they reveal that what they want is located in the ""Panic Room"", they realize that they are in for a long night unless they can figure out a way to outwit the thieves who are trying to get in. One of them it is later revealed helped create the room so he tells the other's that since we can't get in we have to get her to come out. How they attempt to do so is quite suspenseful. Country Music singer Dwight Yoakam is chilling as one of the three villains. He spends the first half of the movie covered up by a mask and speaking very little. However halfway through he gets really nasty and shows his true colours. The movie has a lot of nifty camera angles that give you a spooky tour of the place. Every inch of this place looks creepy at night and during some key scenes it makes the movie all the more frightening. I also liked the whole cat and mouse aspect of the film. The thieves can't get in and mother and daughter can't get out. At one point in the story the heroine finds herself faced with a life or death situation involving her daughter. Does she risk their lives to get what is needed or does she stay in the room and hope for some help? Scary stuff indeed.

There are a few slight trips in the film, but the whole of it easily fills those gaps, letting the movie wash over you, as it should. The high-tech, only-possible-by-computer scenes (such as a shot where it goes from a third floor bedroom, down to the first floor through the center of the staircase, through room after room, and through objects that a movie camera could never pass through), the descent score, the atmosphere, and the fine performances all cumulate to form a easily watched film, without the fuss of too much plot, or too many imperfections.

The criminals are such bumbling idiots that it makes it impossible for the movie to be suspenseful. The holes in the plot are HUGE! Has it been that long since anyone has seen a Hitchcock movie? You'd think that most directors would be familiar with his work, and would have a basic idea of how to create suspense.

1712400,4,B00006681E,"PANIC ROOM could have been a Home Alone parody if not for the luminous Jodie Foster and director David Fincher to pull off an entertaining yet classy thriller. Foster is Meg Altman who finds her new residence in Connecticut invaded by a trio of robbers - and with no one in sight except for her daughter, a hysterical Meg locks herself up with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) in a vault-like room crammed with surveillance cameras and security features. The ""Panic Room"" as it is called contains unknowingly treasure bonds which the robbers have set their sights on. The criminals are played by a solemn Whitaker, a cocky Jared Leto and the psychopath-in-a-mask Yoakham. Their conflicts act on to the palpable tension.
No doubt the story is a conventional damsel-in-distress; but Fincher having helmed Seven, Fight Club and The Game stylishly creates a five-storey house on the Upper West side. He manipulates the space through fluid camera takes and swoops down with spectral camera through airducts and walls to intensify the narration. The house is immediately cavernous and sepulchural. Jodie Foster is at her best with protective maternal instincts, pounding robbers with sledgehammers in spite of her claustrophobia. Her daughter is complicated by her diabetes and requires an insulin shot urgently. Panic Room manages to grip with anxiety and atmosphere - it has substance enough to raise an alarm in us.",1022803200,2,1416,5.134199134199134
1712401,4,B00006681E,"The movie begins with a recently divorced wife and her child looking for home to buy.  They choose an expensive mansion/townhouse that has this ""panic room"" in case of emergency.  It has 3 foot thick steel walls, tv screens of all the surveilance cameras throughout the house, a separate phone line, and unknown to the new owners of the house, several million dollars worth of bonds in a hidden safe.  3 crooks did know about the bonds and all would have gone smoothly for them except for the fact that they moved into it a week early.
Jodie Foster is pretty sexy in this one, acting most of the movie wearing a tight black spagetti top.  The girl who plays her daughter is ugly and I seriously thought she was a boy for about a half an hour into the movie until she was called by the name of Sarah.
The plot is pretty engaging throughout the movie.  Three burglars break into their house, expecting it to be empty but they moved in a week early, so this creates problems.  The woman and her kid make it into the panic room just in time, in safety.  But the crooks won't leave so easily and they know more about the panic room than the new inhabitants do.  They know that the separate phone line for it isn't hooked up yet and they know there is a fortune in bonds in the safe, left behind by a deceased man that no one else knows about.  It is interesting seeing all the ways they try getting into the panic room and getting them to come out.  The unexpected pressure makes conflict break out among the three accomplices.  Two out three of them end up killed right in the house by each others hands.  I don't remember how or which crook knew of the bonds, but I was wondering why the woman or the crooks never thought of splitting it with her in exchange for her cooperation.  But that wouldn't have made much of a movie, now would it?  Like ""Ransom"", this movie shows how being rich can put one into danger by being a target.
I found it ironic that the biggest crook of the three had been some type of security person working to keep guys like them out and now he's a crook because things didn't work out the way he wanted them to, he told the kid.  It was also ironic that the guy didn't want to hurt anyone in the burglary but he came back into the house to kill the burglar who was about to kill the woman.  Had it not been for that delay, he probably would have made it out of the place, and out of the country, with 22 million dollars.  But because he spared her life, the cops got him in time.  Telling him to hold his hands up, the bonds were in his fist.  They told him they wanted to see his palms, so he had to let go of the bonds and the wind of the storm that had been going on all night blew them away.  Then the scene moved ahead and her kid is older and they are looking at houses in the classifieds again.  I was wondering what would become of that man.  I mean, yes, he's guilty of breaking and entering and stealing the bonds, and killing his accomplice, but didn't he save the life of the woman and her kid?  If it wasn't for him, the other two would've just killed them, as they nearly did several times.",1021939200,2,3126,4.164725457570715
1712402,3,B00006681E,"When we watch this kind of thriller, with its contrived and implausible premises, we had better check first the following three points: 1) director; 2) actor(s); 3) and scriptwriter.  In the case of ""Panic Room,"" the very person who gathers our most enhansed expectation is, naturally, the first one, David Fincher, and when it comes to his trademark sweeping cameraworks, you soon realize he did a good job.
First, don't be late for the show, not a minute for, you'll soon see, the most innovative part of the whole film is, rather ironically, its first five minutes in which you can see one of the most original titleback designs you ever see these days.  As we are greatly intrigued by Kyle Cooper's titles in Fincher's ""Se7en,"" so we are to be astonished to see the film's title and cast's names as if really floating in the sky of Manhattan.  It is very stylish and original, so not a blink should not allowed.  Don't let your friends talk to you or detain you in front of the box-office, thinking it's just an opening credit sequence.
And now we come to No. 2, Ms. Foster.  Replacing Nicole Kidman who bailed out from the production (but whose voice is briefly heard as a cameo), Jodie Foster gives her good, solid performance as the heroine of modern-day thriller, who, as  always, should appears ordinary at first, but later becomes incredibly tough when required.  As her daughter appears newcomer Kristen Stewart in good shape, but the real story begins when three burglers (Whitaker, Yoakam, Leto, all typecast) break into her 4-storey building equipped with ""Panic Room,"" a secret high-tech room prepared in case of emergency.
And, guys, there's a rub, I mean No. 3, the script.  Oh, if you are a fan of first-rate thrillers like me, you will be dismayed, as you easily find so many holes in David Koepp's story that you can predict what the characters are going to do the next five minutes.  Even the dialogues are barely average, one of them referring to SOS signal too banal way, making me anticipate the name of, before the character speaks, ""Titanic,"" and she says exactly the same way!  (No way!)  Seriously, David Koepp's scripts, if you remember, are always helped greatly by master directors -- see ""Spider-man"" ""Jurassic Park"" and so on and on....  Well, I admit his cat-and-mouse story is just ... adequate, but nothing more.  But what the heck is this plot hole (not a minor one, you'll notice) about door censor?  Or, how come such a rich person, who can afford to take an entire floor on the spot in today's New York City, fails to provide enough security for herself and her child?  Come on!
Those complaints aside, the director David Fincher keeps the ball rolling on pretty tactfully, not boring the viewers till the film's not a little predictable ending.  To be frank, though I do not admire his technical things so much as others, it is, I admit, something breathlesstaking to watch his sweeping camerawork -- see, for example, how the camera floats in the air, from above the floor through the dark room and even a coffee pot, too.  And it also peeps through the key hole (wow, some might say).  After all, these things remain in your memory best because, for that purpose, stylist Fincher took 40 and 50 and more takes of each scene.
In conclusion, ""Panic Room"" caters what we expect from modern thrillers based on our fears about our modern life in Western Civilization, especially about ever increasing crimes.  However, don't look for reality, just fun, and larger-than-life fun at that.",1021939200,8,3524,4.747540983606557
1712403,5,B00006681E,"Director David Fincher has given his expectant audience, who revelled in his previous works including the left of center Seven and Fight Club, a much more conventional suspense story with Panic Room. This will almost certainly give Fincher his greatest box office takings, but he can be equally proud of his latest work which will be appreciated by the masses and not only the cult followers his other works have attracted. Jodie Foster carries the film with a performance that equals her Oscar winning performance of her best work, Silence Of The Lambs. She is entirely convincing in her role of a recently divorced mother who moves into a large (too large) new house with her 12 year old daughter, only to become a target of three burglars during her first night in her new home. Country singer Dwight Yoakam is outstanding in his supporting role of burglar Raoul, and his performance is complemented by fellow criminals Forest Whittaker (this actor gains the audiences sympathy in almost every role he takes), and comic relief Jared Leto. My attention didn't waver for the entire duration of the film and both the gasping and prolonged silences of the audience in the theatre seemed to indicate that they too were both surprised and enthralled by the film's twists and turns.

Not too inaccurate for a movie!
Ah, yes, the rest of the movie was well done as well.",1021248000,,398,4.541666666666667
1712405,3,B00006681E,"The only thing that saved this movie was director David Fincher. Unfortunately, Fincher's brilliant use of camera and rare direction skills are immensely overshadowed by a very weak screenplay and rediculous dialouge. The bumbling ""bad guys"" are three stooger-like and show no signs of originality. The soundtrack is the main source of the thrills in an otherwise mediocre thriller. Throughout the film, there are obvious instances where the screenwriter ran out of ideas and just threw in ridiculous sequences to make the running time respectable.
  So if you're looking for a cheap, thoughtless thriller with no real creativity (except of course the unorthodox camera work of Fincher) this is the movie for you. But, if you're looking to see a film that keeps you interested with excellent all around acting, a realistic script, and effective suspense,(and you're a Jodie Foster fan) I recommend ""Silence of the Lambs.""

Not really, since the main purpose of thrillers & 'Action' movies is to 'thrill' & excite, not to compete with Shakspeare plays...
The plot is more or less standard: a mother and her diabetic daughter move to a new & VERY big house, which has a 'panic' or 'safe' room - a room which can only be opened from the inside once locked. On thier first night in the house, before the room is completely set up, they end up using it against 3 burgulars that come into it (thinking the house was still empty). They want something that is hidden in a safe in the panic room - and a game of cat and mouse begins.
I think that Jodie Foster was perfect for the part, especially with her Clarice Starling (Silence of the Lambs) background - with all due respect to Nicole Kidman, she would have never been able to portray such feminine yet strong character as well as Jodie.",1020729600,4,1050,4.417525773195877

And the last was impassive, collected, and unflinching at anything. It was really fun getting to watch these guys play against the good girls. I'll admit I got to wanting one of the bad guys to win!
The bad points of the movie were it had almost no plot and that lead to an almost perfectly predictability. Also from the same bad plotting came lots of completely useless scenes and scenes just plain dragged out way too far.

1712408,4,B00006681E,"I actually went to see this film with rather low expectations, but already while watching the extremely cool looking front titles (hovering as integrated parts of the surrounding cityscape) I knew I was going to love this movie.
The setup is at first glance a somewhat thin story about a newly divorced lady (Jodie Foster) and her daughter moving into a huge Manhattan residence. The apartment which has until recently been inhabited by an old paranoid plutocrat appears to be extremely well equipped including a room less ordinary - the so called ""Panic Room"" - a room to which the flats inhabitants can withdraw and withstand a burglars siege for over a week - which should be more then enough time for calling the police (from the built-in phone) and get them to take care of the intruders. At first glance mother and daughter don't  expect the Panic Room to be of much use, but without spoiling to much I can assure you it will. Unwanted guests show up and serious troubles begin...
Director David Fincher has brilliantly succeeded in taking a very simplistic story and transforming it into a great movie of intense action and extreme non-stop claustrophobic tension. Though some of the characters are quite stereotypic both Jodie Foster, Forrest Whitaker and not to forget Kristen Stewart (the daughter) delivers solid acting performances. The cinematography is very cool offering several interesting camera angels including remarkable shots from within keyholes, air ducts and gas pipes.

If you just watch this movie for the plot you will propably think it rather lame, but if you are a fan of David Fincher you will defenately be carried away by the extreemly cool finish found in every aspect the movie and you will easily be able to disregard the plot holes the simplicity of the story.",1020384000,2,1796,4.904605263157895
1712409,5,B00006681E,"David Fincher could quite possibly be the best director in the world today.
  Panic Room is incredible, without doubt the most tense, thrilling and exhilirating movie of this or indeed any year.  From the slick and professional opening sequence featuring famous and distinctive images of the Big Apple, you know you are in for a top quality picture.
  The casting has been fantastic, if I didn't know better then I'd say Kristen Stewart really was Jodie Foster's daughter.  Or clone.  The similarities in appearance is obvious but their acting is flawless, both seem genuinely frightened throughout and the chemistry between them is undeniable.  The atmosphere when they are in the panic room itself could be cut with a knife, the tension is electric.
  David Fincher's immense skill is shown by the awe-inspiring camera work in the opening half hour as Leto/Whitaker try to enter the house, instead of switching angles often, we are kept with one long continuous shot and the tension is heightened.
  Howard Shore's awesome score while send a tingle up your spine as you try to guess what will happen next and as you will Foster/Stewart to succeed.
  Panic Room is a movie which will effect you in many more ways than you can imagine.  A heartstopping rollercoaster thrill ride that doesn't let up once it takes you over entirely  and holds you to the edge of your seat.  This could be the best two hours which Hollywood brings us this year, you owe it to yourself to indulge in one of the most intense cinematic experiences possible.

1712410,2,B00006681E,"I haven't seen ""Alien 3"" since it's theatrical release, but I'm inclined to think that I'd watch that again than ""Panic Room.""
Fincher fans will no doubt love ""Panic Room"" because surely, you can't go wrong with Fincher. And you can't, cause he's not the problem here. In fact, he deserves kudos for taking up a film with so many obstacles: namely, a single location, a small number of characters, and a restricted period of time in which the story takes place. But all these challenges are ones that should've been overcome at the scripting stage. Fincher isn't fighting an up-hill battle. He's trudging through the remains of a dead script.
Fincher's strength - his dark and innovative visual style - gets completely overtaken by the boring, simple, unmotivated screenplay by Koepp that has several crippling weaknesses:
1) laughable dialogue with too much reliance on expletives and hokey name-calling
2) ineffective build-up of tension due to drawn-out, somewhat ridiculous plot devices
3) inability to believe Foster and her daughter are in any real danger because of the presence of Whitaker's character
4) a non-engaging cat-and-mouse game because too little is happening - people are just waiting for their opponents' next move
5) minimal character development that offers no surprises
That last weakness is the Achilles heel of ""Panic Room."" In Fincher's previous films, the twists and surprises come not in plot, but in character. ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" pay off at the end because of what is revealed about Tyler and John Doe. In ""Panic Room,"" not only are the characters one-dimensional, they're also extraneous. Junior serves no practical purpose in the story - he could've simply stepped in at the middle (to bring out Raoul's wild side) and stepped out. Raoul himself doesn't do much up until that point. And Foster's daughter has no effect on the events whatsoever. She would've served the same purpose (namely, as the object of Foster's maternal instinct) if she were comatose or an infant baby.
But bland characters do not doom a film. It can still be enjoyable if there's a a nice plot twist or two. Alas, there's not even a cheap surprise in store for you at the end of ""Panic Room."" And that's a shame because the premise sets up an intriguing question: what's in the panic room that these thieves are so anxious to get? Early in the film, Leto states to Whitaker (and the audience) what's supposed to be there. And guess what. The very thing they expect is exactly what they find. Yawn.
Because the screenplay is so thin and lacking, Fincher's signature camera tricks are reduced to gimmicks that fail to further the plot or create any tension. For example, it's painfully obvious that the camera enters the keyhole for no purpose other than to point out ""Look! We went into a keyhole, isn't that a hoot?""
With Fincher at the helm, ""Panic Room"" should've been an innovative, genre-defying film driven by strong, memorable characters, instead of the run-of-the-mill thriller that it is.",1020038400,9,3008,4.93491124260355

But what helped this movie was the always good performance by Jodie Foster and the stellar performance of Forrest Whitaker, who in my opinion was the best in the movie.

The story and characters are very straight foward, but any viewer should know what they are getting into based on the movie's title alone. Like Hitchcock, Fincher takes a minimilist idea and blows it out of the water: the movie's entire setting is confined in one house, but what the director does visualy creates the most beautiful intensity that has what Fincher has established as a directoral style. This is a movie that will speak to anyone who appericates natural lighting cinematography and direction with excellent performances from everyone, including the kid (who sucsessfuly walked the fine line of being a brat type character, but one you still didn't want to die.)

1712414,2,B00006681E,"Let me start off this review by saying that I originally had absolutely no intentions of watching Panic Room.  However, a few weeks after it's release, I learned that the movie was directed by the amazing David Fincher.  Being a huge fan of both Seven and Fight Club, probably Fincher's two most successful movies, I decided I could not help but give the movie a chance, despite what appeared to me to be an extremely cheesy concept.
The movie was almost exactly what I expected it to be before I discovered David Fincher directed it.  However, before I get into the bad things, I will get my positive comments in first: David Fincher's stylish directing edge was clearly visible throughout the movie.  From insanely impossible extreme close-ups to a 3-minute part of the movie in which the camera seemed to float around the house in ways that defied the laws of physics, Panic Room was never lacking in visual flair.
However, visual flair was about all the movie had going for it.  And without a good script or solid concept to back up the crazy camera tricks, the stylin' techniques Fincher applied to the movie felt more like filler then anything else.  That isn't to say the acting wasn't well done.  Jodie Foster gave a solid performance, and for some reason I always enjoy watching Jared Leto act (Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club).  However, the actors simply had nothing to work with.
The crazy plot twists usually so invasive in the scripts David Fincher chooses to work with are replaced with hollow shells of twists, such as the always expected ""oh wow that guy got killed"" surprise, to the mind-numbingly predictable ""look at the irony, first we were locked outside and now we are locked inside"" so-called ""twist.""  The characters are absolutely forgettable, as if they were pulled out of a catalogue of cliches: the recently divorced mother, the edgy-yet-caring young daughter, the insane criminal, the greedy-yet-sane criminal, and the pushed-into-a-life-of-crime-against-my-will criminal.  That's the five characters, and you won't remember a single one of them within a month of watching this movie.
While intense at certain moments, I found that most of the time I simply didn't care what happened to the characters in this movie.  This movie in no way lives up to David Fincher's past work (unless you count his first movie, the widely-hated Alien 3, which to be perfectly honest I haven't even bothered watching completely), and if you are showing up expecting another Seven or Fight Club, or even another The Game, get ready to be disappointed.

1712416,5,B00006681E,"I really enjoyed this film. The entire premise was revealed in the first 10 minutes, if you paid attention, and I was thinking that this was going to be a formula bore-fest with predictable goings-on and stock good guys & bad guys. I was right about the premise, but in the hands of David Fincher (whom I've admired greatly since ""Alien 3"" and all subsequent endeavors) the standard becomes quite unique. I consider Jodie Foster to be among the finest living actresses, and she comes through like a pro, as usual. There are certain elements in her portrayal that are gripping. She's having a hard time with the realization that she'd been dumped by hubby for a newer version, trying to understand, as well as showing genuine motherly devotion to her seemingly insensitive daughter (a fine, understated performance by Kristin Stewart...who reminded me of a young Ellen de Generes). After about an hour into the film, I realized that NONE of the 5 main characters had any discernable self-confidence, and these weaknesses added substantially to the resulting hour of the film. Though this could be compared to ""Desperate Hours"", ""Cape Fear"" or ""Wait Until Dark"", the characters in ""Panic Room"" were less sure of themselves, allowing the audience to identify to a stronger degree. Indeed, Foster's new-found courage (when daughter gets sick) gives her a strength above the others. Forrest Whittaker is best when he plays a nice guy, as he does here (the stock ""victim of circumtances""); Dwight Yoakam was strong as the true psychotic in the group, and Jered Leto, with his whining rich-kid, poor put-upon creep, made me want to find him and slap him silly. To have that effect on me made me realize that his performance was really fine. Fincher maintained a solid, steady mood; and the camera-work was reminiscent of the best of Hitchcock, though not quite as subtle. But it's Jodie Foster, with sly nuance and mild double-takes that snaps her out of her funk. It's clever, despite the predictibility of it all, and as the only material Hollywood has to deal with lately are re-hashes of old plots, you could do worse than enjoying the Filmmakers' talents involved in ""Panic Room"".",1019520000,3,2178,4.905149051490515

After the disappointment of 'The Game', we somehow knew that this interesting director would indeed attempt to out due himself, or at least show us that his casting director(s), after the dismal mistake with Michael Douglas, could redeem themselves. Let's face it, with a resume like Jodi Foster, its hard to go wrong, and this certainly was proved in ~Panic Room~. She puts in a grand performance that we've come to expect.
This film grabs you from the start - the opening credits are original and quite impressive - so much so, they're worth the price of admission alone. In fact, call me strange, but I wanted to sneak back into the theatre during the second showing to see them again.
The camera work is pure art. The planning for each shot shows an attention to detail and seamless quality that does not detract from the viewing. Confined to such a small space over months of shooting, every scene is painstakingly crafted; the editing is tight, which only adds to the suspense.
The plot is almost laughably simple, but an excellent scenario in which to get actors and crew to surpass their limits as artists. Fencher surely achieved this end, because everything but the plot itself is superlative. During the first ten minutes of viewing, I kept thinking: in terms of style what does this film remind me of? Hitchcock came to mind. ~Panic Room~ has a 'Vertigo' and 'Rope' feel to it without question. For me, at any rate, this only added to the film's enjoyment.
David Fencher set a new standard with his masterpiece, 'Seven' (another work of art in editing that won an Oscar nomination), which deserved all the acolades it received. But, unfortunately, ~Panic Room~ doesn't quite set a new standard, but more a thriller piece that should please moviegoers interested in this genre of film.

The plans that the criminals plan are intelligent, and the mother and daughter do a very well done job on dodging those attacks, and staying alive. The cast performs a fantastic job in acting, and I think the camera shots and angles are what make Panic Room, so suspenseful. If you're in the mood for a very good suspenseful movie, with great acting and just a great storyline, then see Panic Room the next time you go watch a movie.

1712419,4,B00006681E,"A stupid film this is not.  'Panic Room' is a suspense-packed, tension-filled, thinking person's thriller. It isn't dumbed-down and doesn't play stupid games with the audience.  (These days, that's hard to find in a movie.)
Jodie Foster plays a rich woman who has just bought a Manhattan townhouse for herself and her teenage daughter.  The house contains a ""panic room,"" a shelter the homeowners can use in case of a break-in or an attack.  Well...you know what happens next.  Three criminals break in looking for money during the ladies' first night in the house.  Thankfully, the women can seek refuge in the panic room.  But guess where the money is hidden?
David Fincher is a very gifted director.  He does a lot of things visually that are very subtle, such as the opening title sequence which covers the sprawling, wide-open city of New York.  (It's a nice antithesis compared to the confined space of the panic room.)  Fincher also displays some really nifty camera effects, mainly just to show you that he _can_ do them.  But what I appreciate is the fact that Fincher has made this film very approachable for a much wider audience than his previous films ('Seven' and 'Fight Club' in particular).  If you've been reluctant to see a Fincher film because of what you've heard about his other films, leave your worries outside the theatre.  Instead, walk into the theatre and expect to have a great time watching a great cast do great work.",1019433600,11,1447,4.786290322580645

Talk about a boring movie. Right from the beginning, it seemed painfully obvious that nothing would become of this film (dare I even call it that). Leto was just so awful, that I was glad to see him go - not soon enough in my opinion. Jodie Foster - what a waste of talent (probably her easiest acting job to date). And that little girl of hers - reminded me of everything I didn't like about Terminator 2. Enough cheesy one liners to make you physically ill. I personally found myself not really caring about the movie's outcome after an hour or so. It's THAT bad. This is one of those, ""Oh it's on cable for the 42nd time movies"" Why was the audience laughing aloud? Why did I get the same urge to leave that I had when watching AI ??? Probably because it's THAT bad! Yuk!",1019433600,2,929,4.138121546961326
1712421,2,B00006681E,"Three Stooges burglars add to implausibility
What started as an interesting premise and supplemented with a high-impact trailer that led you to believe that you would be experiencing a non-stop fear-induced adrenaline-high ended up being so bumbling and therefore implausible as to kill the adrenaline gland and make me wish had some chocolate from the snack bar to tide me over.
Illogical and irrational decisions, first by the burglars, as well as later by Jodi Foster's character and her `daughter' finally crumbled the reality the filmmaker was trying to portray.  Once I has seen enough really BAD decisions on both sides (bad guys and good guys), I could no longer in my mind put myself in their shoes and thereby feel their fear.  Instead I found myself saying (to myself), ""That's a stupid thing to do, why aren't you doing the obvious?""  Jodi Foster's character switched back and forth from admirably logical to extremely illogical.  I suspect that anyone in a real-life situation like that would act somewhat the same.  However, in reality, I would expect illogicalness at the onset of the situation to be followed afterwards by increasing logical decisions as the situation was better understood.  This logical/illogical swing didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason.  But the burglars' ineptitude and truly stupid thought-processes and resulting decisions finally broke the camels back of reality, and for the rest of the movie, I had to console myself with wondering what silly or illogical thing the cast would do next.
I enjoy many of Jodi Foster's roles, but this was disappointing.
Maybe okay to rent, but don't expect to get scared enough to run out and build yourself a ""panic room"" when a ""concern nook"" will do just fine.",1019433600,5,1742,5.006920415224913

Jodie's character definitely did not miss her marriage.  Her character took out hostilities on the three who broke in.  All of them.  There's fighting and there's fighting and while I love zany gore films like Army of Darkness, the cruelty displayed in this film left a sick feeling in my stomach.

1712423,4,B00006681E,"There is something to be said about PANIC ROOM, an intense thriller along the lines of STRAW DOGS and WAIT UNTIL DARK: It is an extraordinarily claustrophobic film.  But that's the beauty of films like these, because it forces us to imagine what we would do if, like the mother and daughter (Jodie Foster, Kristin Stewart) in this film, we were in that kind of a position.
The pair find themselves at the mercy of deranged burglars (Jared Leto, Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam) looking for a stash worth millions in Foster's new Manhattan townhouse.  Foster and Stewart barricade themselves in a ""panic room"", complete with TV monitors and emergency supplies.  It is a regular 21st century fallout shelter of sorts.  Unfortunately for them, it is also where the crooks want to get into.
Except for the excess of profanity in the screenplay, writer David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE) and director David Fincher (SEVEN) are able to keep the tension extraordinarily palpable throughout.  In a very good cinematic ploy, the story is set entirely during one single rainy night and early morning.  Certain moments are very hair-raising.  Foster is, not surprisingly, really good; and Whittaker makes for a convincing heavy who nevertheless seems to allow for some audience sympathy at times, while his two friends go off on psychotic rages.
An extremely good ""house under siege"" suspense item, PANIC ROOM is one of the best films of 2002.",1019433600,10,1446,5.050420168067227
1712424,1,B00006681E,"""Panic Room"" gets its name from a certain room in houses that is designed to protect its residents from danger. The panic room in this film had a door, similar to that of a bank vault, that could only be opened by those inside and had a supply of milk to last its residents for months. Jody Forster, a newly divorced woman, and her daughter move into a large house in the upper westside of Manhattan, and utilize their panic room in their first night in the house to hide from three burglers who invade their home looking for a cache of money hidden inside this room.
Without giving away any more of the plot, I found this movie to be one of the dullest ""thrillers"" I have ever seen. It seemed that the film was made up entirely of bits and pieces of similar movies of this genre that were haphazardly pasted together. Two of the three thugs were total Neanderthals and the third, who had worked on constructing such panic rooms in the past, was the typical criminal with a heart of gold. He was the true professional and was in it only for the money. He was so good to Jodie, and especially to her daughter, that someone should have nominated him for the Nobel peace prize. I could have predicted the ending even before the film began. My suggestion is not to waste your time and money on this clunker.",1019433600,8,1303,4.344262295081967
1712425,5,B00006681E,"Panic Room is a new version of an old story but is much more than it appears.  The characters are trapped by the bad guys and for some reason, the cops aren't able to help.  It's been done before and will be done again.  This movie adds a new aspect to this simple story.  The addition of the panic room to the house, a room that nobody can get in or out of, that runs completely separate from the house.  Just watching the movie made me want one for myself.  The suspense of this movie is completely based on the room itself and the two sides of defending the room and attacking the room.  The movie was a lot more interesting than it sounds.
The main character Meg Altman, played by Jodie Foster, and her daughter Sarah find themselves trapped in their new home when a group of burglars enter their home in the middle of the night.  The burglars aren't  just your run of the mill, smash and grab thieves.  One of them knows that the room exists and how the whole thing is put together.  The characters take turns having the upper hand that keeps the movie interesting throughout.  The atmosphere of the house itself also added to the suspense of the movie, taking on a creepy character all it's own.
The casting in this movie is nothing short of spectacular.  Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam all fit their respective roles to a tee.  Dwight Yoakam especially plays evil like it's second nature.  For another example check out ""Sling Blade.""  And Jodie Foster was excellent and in my mind the only move that proves that she ages at all is ""Taxi Driver.""  Kristen Stewart also did an admirable job playing Jodie Foster's daughter although I'll admit, I thought she was a boy for the first 15 minutes of the movie.

The best part of the movie was the cinematography that director David Fincher used.  You can definitely tell that the same crew worked on Fight Club and Seven and I loved both of those movies.  The way the movie was shot added volumes to how creepy it was.  And the sets were so detailed that the fact that the movie was a single setting plot didn't bother me at all.  And the movie is worth seeing for just the opening credits alone.  I've never seen anything done quite like it.  All in all a good movie to see.
The Breakdown:
1.  Plot-8 (New version of an old story)
2.  Characters-8 (Typical of these types of movies but nicely balanced)
3.  Flow-8 (Slow start but nicely paced)

1712426,4,B00006681E,"In ""Panic Room,"" directed by David Fincher, Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a woman recently divorced from her super-rich husband. Together with her daughter (Kristen Stewart), Meg moves into a luxurious four-floor Manhattan home that is equipped with a ""panic room"": a fortified, high-tech bunker for use in case of a home invasion. Of course, right after mother and daughter move in, such a home invasion occurs. This leads to a gripping chess-like contest between homeowner and criminals, and is ultimately resolved in an electrifying conclusion.
""Panic Room"" is a lean, gripping thriller that is full of intriguing plot turns and inventive gambits (by both heroes and villains). There are solid performances by the entire cast, which includes Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto (in an appalling hairdo), and Dwight Yoakam. Ian Buchanan is especially fun in his brief role as an imperious, but oh-so-charming real estate agent (a performance prominently featured in the film's memorable trailer).
Overall, I really enjoyed ""Panic Room."" But I couldn't help feeling that the film has a creepy classist and sexist flavor. I find it hard to really summon up sympathy for a super-rich woman who can afford such a uber-luxurious crib when my hard working public school teacher sister lived for years in a Manhattan efficiency! Is the subtle message here that we as a society need to work harder to protect the property of the priveleged and wealthy? And there seems to be a further subtle anti-feminist message: that if Foster's character had worked harder to please her super-rich ex-husband, he wouldn't have dumped her for another woman, and thus she wouldn't have needed the new digs and wouldn't have gotten into this mess at all.
Oh well; perhaps I overanalyze. Bottom line: ""Panic Room"" is a genuinely effective thriller with skillful direction and solid work from a terrific cast. But don't say I didn't warn you about the really creepy subtexts.",1018915200,2,1944,5.116352201257862

Kristen Stewart, who played Jodie's daughter, did a wonderful job also.  The other actors also did a good job.  The director of the film, David Fincher, did an absolutely amazing job on this movie.  No director, in my opinion could have done a better job.
Panic Room is about a youug woman, Jodie, who just got a divorce from her rich husband.  It starts off with Jodie touring a house in New York.  She goes in to one room and realizes its smaller than it should be.  When she asks the man that is showing her the house he says shes the first person to realize it.  He then opens the panic room.  Jodie finds the room intimidating but her daughter loves it.  That night Jodie's trying to set everything up in her house and then goes to sleep.

On their first night there, three guys break in looking for '3 million' dollars which is located in the panic room. Unfortunately Jodie sees them on the camers in the panic room when she goes to turn everything off in their and stuff, so she runs and gets her daughter, & they run and get in the panic room. Now since they r in it, the robbers can't get in it. So over intercom Jodie tells them to 'get out of my house' & they tell her why they're there. Jodie and her daughter refuse to ever come out. Unfortunately they try putting gas in there to scare them out, so Jodie lights a lighter & blows the gas up into the gascontainer & the guys get hurt instead.

So when Jodie thinks she can make it to her daughter's room where a refrigerator (mini one) is by her bed, the two 'remaining' guys get in there with the daughter. Luckily Jodie throws in the bag of needles and insulin bottles into the panic room right before the door shuts. One of the guys is nice enough to give the girl the shot. When the two guys aren't looking, the little girl hides the needles behind her back.

The film blew my mind away.  Jodie Foster was so great in this film.  I heard that Nicole Kidman was originally supposed to be the leading role, but she was injured while filming ""Moulin Rouge"" so she didn't have enough time to heal and be in ""Panic Room"".  I was kinda mad about that but what can you do?
Kristen Stewart was also very excellent at playing Jodie Foster's daughter.  For a newcomer, she was outstanding.

1712431,4,B00006681E,"David Fincher has always been a very visual director. He understands the most innovative and revolutionary film techniques to appeal to every sense. This is apparent in his films 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club'; however in this outing delivers a film that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for 100 minutes in the thriller 'Panic Room'.
The premise when first looked at is rather simple. Recently divorced mother Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) moves into a huge new house on Manhattan's West Side, which is not only enormous but has something most places don't; a panic room. This room is solid concrete, on top of steel, fixed out with surveillance cameras; in short nothing can get in, or out.
On their first night Meg and daughter Sarah (Kirsten Stewart), whose relationship has been strained since the divorce, are awoken by three criminals (Jared Leto, Dwight Yokam, and the socially minded Forest Whitaker) who are hell bent in entering the house. Thus Meg and Sarah run into the panic room hidden behind a mirror in the master bedroom, expecting the thieves will ransack the house and leave. The plot twists from here, as the criminals actually want the 22 million dollars in bearer bonds hidden in a floor safe in the panic room. What ensues is an intense pseudo game of `hide and seek' with Meg and Sarah trapped by the three criminals.
The characters that Fincher establishes are amazing. The film wouldn't have the same feel if Nicole Kidman (who was due to be cast) were in the role of Meg. It is the dichotomy Foster portrays between a sensitive, maternal Female, who is forced to react in a very masculine way. In this sense Foster plays a character much like Clarice in `Silence of the lambs', who's femininity in brought to the forefront but extenuous circumstances.
Perhaps the single thing that strikes the audience and appeals to them is Fincher's mind blowing camera work. He uses the camera like another member of the cast, as the importance he imbues on the camera. The viewer is taken place conventional rigs could never take the viewer before. Into locks, between banisters, even a spiraling shot down the staircase that can only be resembled to Hitchcocks shot in `Vertigo'. David Fincher is a director who truly understands film as a visual medium. Lets face it there are times where his idea's could have flopped in `Panic Room' when an entire room is reconstructed with CG then the camera moves through it could have looked really hokey... but it works to great effect.
My only criticism of the film is sometimes the pacing slows down a bit. Fincher's work always moves very quickly and I feel at times the middle of the film lagged a little; otherwise it was great.
`Panic Room' is a fantastic piece of modern cinema. A great thriller that will keep the audience of the edge of their seats. Fincher's masterful direction coupled with brilliant acting allows the film to be a stand out as one of the best this year.",1018483200,27,2942,4.7368421052631575

It was fantastic. I thought Jodie was excellent. She played the victim but you could never tell by the way she portrayed the new homeowner being burglarized during her first night. Her daughter, wonderfully done by Kristen Stewart, seemed to have a sexual identity problem. Apparently whoever decided to give Jodie a daughter, must have had a son in mind.
It's nice to see a woman, playing a victim but not being the victim. She proved to her attackers that she was not going down without a fight.
She reminded me alot of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (the 2nd one). Tough as nails and not ready to sit down and be counted out.
Dwight Yokum (sp) was evil beyond description except when he got caught in the Panic Room. <you have to see it to understand>

1712443,4,B00006681E,"Everyone likes to think that they'd know what they would do-- without hesitation, yet-- if suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a perilous, even life-threatening, situation.  It's human nature; we all want to feel, or at least believe, that we are always in control of everything that happens in our lives.  But, upon reflection, if that IS, in fact, what you think, then you're probably not being entirely honest with yourself.  Because unless you're Dirty Harry, or someone of that ilk (and take note, the key word here is ""are,"" not ""think"" you are), you're not really going to know how you'd react to any such situation until the moment of truth is actually upon you.  And it's that moment that director David Fincher enables you to experience, albeit vicariously, in ""Panic Room,"" a suspense/thriller that very quickly takes you to a very dark place-- a place few have actually ever been or would care to go, if given the choice.  But, of course, when it comes to a situation like the one depicted in this film, that's the rub:  You simply do not get to choose whether or not you want to participate.  And when you really think about it, it's a concept that is more than a bit disconcerting, to say the least.  Because whether or not you want it, if it happens, you are going to be confronted with that moment of truth; and in that moment, you will probably learn more about yourself than you've ever known before.
 As the film begins, recently divorced New Yorker Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is being shown a property, a spacious Brownstone Townhouse, which she ultimately decides upon and secures for herself and her teenage daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart).  They move in, and prepare for their first night in the new house.  What Meg cannot know, however, is that someone else has an eye on her house, but it has nothing to do with wanting to live there.  His name is Junior (Jared Leto), whom, as it happens, knew the previous tenant-- a wealthy, and apparently paranoid recluse-- more than just a bit.  He also knows (or at least thinks he does) that there is something extremely valuable hidden in that house.  And now that the previous owner has passed on, Junior wants it.
 Toward that end, he recruits a couple of acquaintances, Burnham and Raoul (Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) to help him get it.  But as fate would have it, Junior makes his move on the very night that Meg and Sarah move into the house, which as far as Junior knows, is still vacant.  They break in successfully, but it all goes south quickly when they discover the house is occupied, a situation for which Junior and his gang have no contingency plans; and their hesitation enables Meg and Sarah to make it to a safe room-- the ""Panic Room"" of the title-- a virtually impregnable room built by the previous owner as a safeguard against intruders.  And with the aid of a closed-circuit video surveillance/security system, Meg is able to monitor the movements of the trespassers throughout the house from inside her fortress, and she has no intention of emerging until they are gone.  But Junior is adamant; and he's not about to leave until he has what he came for.  And at that point, the standoff begins.
 In his previous films (especially ""Se7en"") Fincher has established his use of a dark, brooding atmosphere-- pregnant with foreboding-- to enhance the suspense and drama of his story, and this film is no exception.  Night falls, and Fincher uses the oncoming darkness and the stillness of the house to create a sense of isolation that is the subtle beginning of the tension he will continue to build and maintain throughout the film.  He also uses some imaginative camera work, slowly exploring the house from the audience's point-of-view, which-- combined with Meg's initial apparent trepidation upon entering the panic room itself-- gives it all a pointedly claustrophobic feeling.  Those with difficulties in that regard, in fact, may experience some uneasiness during a good portion of this film because of it; and it simply demonstrates what a good job Fincher did in creating the setting he wanted, and which he uses so effectively here to keep you on the edge of your seat.
 The plot is fairly basic, with an inherently narrow framework within which Fincher must work; but he sets a perfect pace and has an inventive touch both visually and psychologically that enables him to take an average screenplay (by David Koepp) to a higher level in the finished product.  Considering the storyline, some of what happens is-- some would say predictable-- though I prefer to call it inevitable (granted, a thin line differentiates the two; in this case, however, I feel ""inevitable"" is more accurate), and there are some surprises, which Fincher uses to great advantage.
 It's no surprise, however, that what really elevates this film is the totally convincing performance by Jodie Foster as Meg.  Long one of the best actors around, she has the talent and ability to turn any material she's given into so much more than any writer or director could possibly hope to expect.  What makes her so remarkable-- as she is in this film-- is not only the fact that she can create such a believable character, but that she can do it with such intelligence and resourcefulness.  You have but to look into Foster's eyes to realize how much is going on constantly behind them; this is one savvy lady whom you can readily believe is always one step ahead of everyone else in the room.  And she goes a long way in proving that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep; she's attractive to begin with, but in a pair of black, horn-rimmed glasses, she looks ravishing.  In the final analysis, ""Panic Room"" is Foster's film; and she makes it a satisfying cinematic experience for her audience.",1017792000,4,5778,4.758517034068136
1712444,4,B00006681E,"I had to wonder, coming out of the theater, if PANIC ROOM wasn't David Fincher's attempt to Keep Hollywood Happy. After his brilliant FIGHT CLUB suffered mixed reviews and box office failure, he must have been aware that he needed a Big Hit if he wanted to keep making movies.
Enter PANIC ROOM, a dark, sharp thriller which showcases the talents of Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker in a cat-and-mouse game between the new owner of a house and the builder of its security systems who is hoping to steal something the previous owner left behind: Whitaker and his crew break in, thinking the new occupants haven't yet moved in, and Foster has time to rush herself and her daughter into the house's Panic Room, an extremely secure high-tech saferoom: the room keeps the intruders out, but it also keeps their intended victims in.
Foster is brilliant as the claustrophobic mom who will do anything to keep her daughter safe, but the film comes up short when she makes choices that most of the audience will perceive as short-sighted at best and stupid at worst. Foster overcomes this script shortcoming by playing the choices convincingly--you can read the conundrum in her face and believe in her reasoning when she makes the poor choice.
It's a credit to Whitaker that his ""villain"" character remains sympathetic throughout--he's not the sort of terrorist-cum-robber that made Alan Rickman famous in DIE HARD. You find yourself hoping that some accord can be reached--that he can just get what he wants and get out safely. Unfortunately, his psychotic partners-in-crime make that an impossibility.
Fincher has always done an excellent job of taking us to the dark side of things, leading the camera into places that the human eye could never see. I'm not sure PANIC ROOM will have the staying power and rewatchability of FIGHT CLUB or SE7EN, but it's definitely the sort of taut thriller that's been missing from the A-movie circuit for years. Not quite a Popcorn Movie...more like a hint of Summer in early Spring.",1017792000,33,2012,4.885964912280702
1712445,3,B00006681E,"What exactly is a panic room? According to David Fincher's new film, appropriately titled ""Panic Room,"" these small, virtually impregnable rooms come equipped with everything from surveillance cameras to a separate, hidden phone line... everything one should need in the event of a burglary or a forced entry. And now, this latest rage in home security finds itself at the center of a thriller that delivers suspense and implausibility in equal measure.
Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a recently divorced mother in the market for a new home. She shares a slightly distanced relationship with her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart); from a conversation between the two early in the film, we gather that all Meg wants is to move on with her life. Her search ends with the purchase of spacious Manhattan home complete with four floors, four fireplaces, an elevator, and (surprise!) a hidden room found behind a mirrored panel in the master bedroom.
The movie does have the good sense to provide an explanation for the inclusion of a panic room in this otherwise normal abode. We are told that the previous owner of the house, a wealthy tycoon fearful of being robbed, had the room built in case of emergences. Coincidentally, this piece of information is followed by the revelation that a comely portion of the deceased's fortune has since been missing (three guesses as to where it's hidden).
To keep things succinct, Meg and Sarah's first night in their new house becomes quite the nightmare when three burglars (played by Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam) force their way in, unaware that the house is now occupied until it is too late. Before they have a chance to collect their reward, Meg and Sarah find refuge in the panic room, where a battle of wits, wills and intelligence ensues as they attempt the thwart the thieves' tactics to penetrate the room.
For all the positive buzz the stronghold attains, there are flaws. For instance, why is it customary that the new owner should have the emergency phone line connected upon arrival? Should it not be a permanently connected line directly to the police? And what about the room's ventilation system, that which enables Meg's aggressors to fill the room with gaseous fumes in one of the film's reality-stretching scenes? Would not such a structure be embedded within the concrete and steel walls of the room? As the attempts to enter the room become more frantic, such questions become increasingly bothersome.
The thieves themselves aren't all too challenging, either. Leto, Whitkaker, and Yoakam do fine jobs in handling the moments of humorous intervention, but this comic relief serves to lessen the suspense that surrounds it. Whitaker's character plays the token softy, while Yoakam's character is increasingly agitated, and furthermore, dimwitted. At one point, observing Meg disabling the surveillance cameras, he makes the remark, ""Why didn't we think of that?""
Director David Fincher (""Seven"") does give the film more redeeming qualities than one would think. He wears his Hitchcock pedigree proudly on his sleeve, filling the movie with an arsenal of foreboding shots that begin on one floor and end on another, sweeping through banisters and revolving throughout hallways and rooms. Underneath the film's predictability lies an undercurrent of effective suspense that holds up surprisingly well, due in part to the claustrophobic setting, and Foster, whose performance is marked by fear and determination.
In the end, a film like ""Panic Room"" is best enjoyed with a continuous suspension of disbelief. The setting is quite striking, not to mention original, but much that revolves around the implausible plot becomes increasingly conventional. For the measurable amount of shocks and energy it manages to generate, the movie qualifies as a by-the-numbers crowd pleaser, but it's by no means nothing to panic over.",1017705600,6,3892,5.159810126582278
1712446,4,B00006681E,"Few directors have the stylistic wit and independent ambition of David Fincher, whose previous films Fight Club and Se7en broke boundaries of taste and standards of what makes a film.  Both projects succeeded, and although Fincher's other works, like Alien 3 and The Game were less successful, it hasn't stopped him from picking some of the most difficult films in mainstream cinema.  Panic Room, written by David Koepp, reflects that.  Based on a slim premise - that of a woman stuck in a sealed ""panic room"" in her new apartment while a band of crooks threatens her outside - Fincher manages to direct a picture with a string-tightening tension reminiscent of Hitchcock.
The story seems a little like Home Alone for adults: after a messy divorce, Meg Altman (Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (newcomer Kristen Stewart) find what seems like a dream apartment on the Upper West Side: four stores, all the amenities, and a special ""panic room"" with its own power, phone, and video surveillance of the house.  When the son of the now-dead former owner leads a band of thugs into the apartment on the first night to recover something, Meg find the room quite useful - until she realizes what the thugs want is in that room.  The rest of the film is a contest between Meg and the thugs to try and outwit each other and live through the night.  With each dark shot, each new plan, and each whittling away of will and strength, the situation continues to get more and more desperate, and Fincher masterfully tightens the noose of suspense.
The computer-to-camera effects Fincher pioneered in Fight Club return here, taking the all-seeing eye through floors, walls, tiny drains, mug-handles, and railings.  Whereas in Fight Club it was stylistic and essential to the story, in Panic Room it seems more of a distraction.  The final ending, too, is weak: after such a gut-wrenching film, one feels let down.  Suspense films are based on the payoff at the end, and it's in those final moments that Panic Room fails to deliver.  For all Panic Room has going for it, it's a shame that it couldn't have found a better ending.",1017705600,7,2119,4.7650273224043715
1712447,3,B00006681E,"Fincher's other films (with the exception of Alien 3 - allegedly re-edited and  butchered by 20th Century Fox before release) are exciting, intelligent thrillers.  ""Panic Room"", however, is a heap of unrealized potential.  The premise is interesting but old - ""helpless"" female(s) trapped in an enclosed space with vicious intruders trying to get to them.  This could have been a tense thriller throughout, but the screenplay and Fincher lay a bit too much comic emphasis on the villains, thus robbing them of much of their fierceness. Once you can laugh at a villain, he doesn't seem very threatening anymore.
 Generally, the characters are mostly stock:  the scared but strong mother, the ill child she must protect, the villain with a heart of gold, etc.  So ""Panic Room"" is too often a re-dressing of characters and a plot many of us have already seen many times before.  Typically, Fincher uses many of his old camera and CGI tricks again, but for little reason other than to prove he can be visually stylish.  Of note, Nicole Kidman was initially cast in Jodie Foster's role, but had to drop out for health reasons.  Too bad, because I think Kidman would have been great here.  Perhaps better than Foster, who never seems to really convey vulnerability when the script called for it.  She always seems a bit smarter than her captors, so her eventual victory has little resonance or relief.  Kidman does have a voice cameo, however, as Foster's ex-husband's girlfriend.  TRIVIA NOTE FOR FINCHER FANS:  about midway through the film Foster's character and her daughter try to communicate an S.O.S. to a neighbor.  The neighbor is played by Andrew Kevin Walker, the screenwriter of Fincher's movie ""Se7en"" from 1995.
BUT....  The absolute best part of this picture (sadly) comes during the opening credits.  Clever use of CGI and aerial shots of Manhattan combine for a visually striking and original title sequence.  If only the script was as original, striking, and clever.",1017705600,,1978,4.975609756097561
1712448,3,B00006681E,"David Fincher has made a career of dealing with the outcasts, the disenfranchised, the rebellious and the denizens of the dark. But in his new film, ""The Panic Room"" he deals with the relatively safe: murderers and thieves..one even with a heart of gold.

She proceeds to move in with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). On their very first night there, three thieves  break in hoping to steal a cache of millions of dollars said to be stored in the safe of the panic room.
Jared Leto plays the erstwhile leader of the pack and as usual he does everything he can to play against type: i.e. a crazed, doped up liar with a scruffy beard and corn-rowed hair.  When is Leto going to realize that, with his matinee idol good looks, he is really the new Robert Redford not the new Steve Buscemi? He simply does not have the acting chops to be Brad Pitt and his performance here is mostly embarrassing.
Dwight Yoakum is scary and volatile as one of the theives and Forest Whitaker is the thief with the heart of gold who saves the life of Meg's diabetic daughter.
The plot is the standard ""woman in peril"" one that has been around for hundreds of years and Fincher surprisingly does very little stylistically to improve upon it.
""The Panic Room"" is business-as-usual for all concerned yet it can't help but be classy in a way that only Foster and Fincher can make it.",1017619200,,1547,4.581227436823105
1712449,4,B00006681E,"Finchers films are obsessed with everything dark.  His filmmaking career has spanned the music video and commercial realm then he dove straight into mainstream Hollywood, although one would hesitate to call Fincher mainstream.  His movies have been violent and oppressive, and this one continues the trend although not to such a high degree.  Panic Room involves Meg Altman played superbly by Jodie Foster and her androgynous daughter played by Kristen Stewart.  They are buying a Manhattan mansion in which to live after Megs divorce from her husband.  The movie never bothers with backstory, instead opting to dive straight into the action about 10 minutes in.  I admired the decision, overlong exposition at the beginning only would have hurt the movie.  And the character intros and dialogue during the first 10-15 minutes are enough for me to get a good background of the characters without it getting too detailed.  The actors portraying the robbers are Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam.  They all fit into the mechanical stereotype usually associated with a team of criminals, the hesitant one, the stupid one, and the resolute psychopath.  You can just take one look at the actors and you can tell whose who.  The performances are well done for the most part, but Jared Leto isn't exactly acting up a storm, he left me cringing with a few of his lines.  But the two others convinced me thoroughly.  And now with the action.  Fincher direction is stellar, his visual flair is stamped all over the movie.  The supurb uncut setup shot at the beginning of the robbery, to the CGI shots detailing the layout of a ventilation shaft among other things are great to look at as well as serving the story.  Fincher ratchets up the suspense like no one can these days, instead of falling into cliche after cliche, the movie sidesteps every one.  There are no ""boo"" moments, no invasive orchestral score, everything gels extremely well.  The only real complaint I have is the ending, it feels unfinished and I was curious about the other characters and what the result of the robbery was, oh well maybe I was asking too much since I didn't want any backstory.  But in all its a better thriller than most these days, and I was thoroughly entertained throughout and I might just see it again, so I recommend.",1017619200,6,2316,4.83248730964467

1712451,4,B00006681E,"'Panic room' is a taut thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of its running time. The story is simple, yet it is gripping, thanks mainly to the excellent camera angles.
Jodie Foster is a divorcee who moves into a new house with her diabetic daughter. The new house is huge, with 3 levels and many rooms. But one room (the 'Panic room') is the centre of all the action. The previous owner of the house was a very rich man and had built this panic room specifically to keep himself safe from anyone who tried to break into the house. On the very first night after Jodie and her daughter move in, 3 thugs (including Forest Whitekar) break into the house. The plot then develops nicely, as Jodie and her daughter take shelter in the panic room and thugs are unable to get into it. But whatever the thugs want from the house is inside the panic room. The rest of the story is the battle of wits between Jodie and the thugs. Jodie tries to keep the thugs away with the added headache of her daughter needing insulin shots (which are not inside the room) and Forest and his buddies try to get Jodie to open the door to the panic room. The whole film is shot inside the house and all the events happen on one night.
It seems that Jodie Foster got this role because Nicole Kidman decided to drop out, it is good for the film that Kidman did so because Jodie is a better actress than her. As always, Jodie Foster gives an even performance. Whitekar does his bit commendably and is ably supported by his buddies.
The direction is good and the cinematography deserves a special mention since it contributes most to the thrills. The film slows down a bit towards the end, but that still does not make it boring.
In the end, this is a tight thriller that is entertaining and worth watching.",1017619200,2,1796,4.332344213649852
1712452,2,B00006681E,"Panic Room (David Fincher, 2002)
I used to think David Fincher was incapable of making a bad movie. Even the last few scenes of Fight Club, as painfully hokey as they were, didn't set me up for a whole two hours of badness. And to be fair, Panic Room isn't all bad. But it's A DAVID FINCHER FILM (yes, in all caps), and that's about it. There's loads of style here, but substance suffers as a result.
Newly-divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen [The Safety of Objects] Stewart, one of the film's true highlights) move into a four-story brownstone in Manhattan. (Suspend one's disbelief, for the moment, that one could actually FIND a four-story brownstone in Manhattan on the market.) The house was equipped with a panic room by its previous owner, a paranoid and very rich financier. Needless to say, the night Meg and Sarah move in, three guys break into the house, looking for the paranoid financier's money, which, as we're told in the beginning, has never been found.
The first review of the movie I read quipped that ""one day, David Fincher will make a movie entirely without light."" The reviewer neglected to add that the same movie will probably take place completely outside in the rain. To further telegraph that this is, in fact, a David Fincher film, we get the nausea-inducing camera tricks of moving between floors, etc., through various air vents and the like (and through walls when nothing convenient is available). And while the film does ostensibly have humans in it, it's obvious within twenty minutes that the stars of this film are the dark, the rain, and the camera.
That said, there's some decent acting in here. Kristen Stewart has already been mentioned, but she deserves another mention. She's good. Jodie Foster does what she can with a limited script (we're given many signs at the beginning that she's claustrophobic, but then when they actually get themselves into the panic room, her claustrophobia magically goes away. Ain't life grand?), as does the usually brilliant Forest Whitaker. Whitaker, along with Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam, are the three invaders. Leto shows absolutely nothing of the talent that made him so watchable in Requiem for a Dream, but Yoakam (South of Heaven West of Hell, Sling Blade, etc.) gives a career-making performance as the only invader who actually seems as if he's a bad guy. (Another script point woefully underdone: loads of possible tension between Yoakam, Stewart, and Whitaker in an extended scene that, in the hands of the right director, could have been a movie in itself [think Polanski's Death and the Maiden, e.g.].) Also, Ann Magnuson's all-too-brief performance as the real estate agent at the beginning of the movie was up to, well, Ann Magnuson's usual standards. Too bad she never shows up again.
I will say in passing that, in the screening I attended, I seemed to be in the minority. The audience (one wonders if they caught Se7en, The Game, or any of Fincher's other superior films) was completely taken in, cheering for the good guys, booing the bad guys, etc. Fincher does manage enough shameless emotional manipulation to make this movie worth killing two hours of your time, but you're much better served waiting for the rental. **",1017619200,9,3251,4.880650994575046

1712454,4,B00006681E,"Jodie Foster was set to appear in David Fincher's ""The Game"" instead of Michael Douglas, but was dropped by the studio.  She finally returns to Fincherdom here, after Nicole Kidman dropped out due to injury (for my money, Kidman is the female Michael Douglas: all anti-charisma and wooden acting).  It's a shame their first collaboration didn't work out, for I thought Douglas was the only thing wrong with ""The Game"".  Imagine what Fincher's career would have looked like if Foster had been kept on:  a fluctuation from testosterone driven Brad Pitt black comedy, to intellectually driven Jodie Foster suspense thriller, and back again.  That's a career to envy, for sure.  Still, as it is, at least we have been given ""Panic Room""
Foster is note-perfect here.  Her Meg Altman is a female action hero, only not in the Ellen Ripley sense.  Meg is imperfect.  She's just trying to do right by her daughter, while keeping her contempt for her failed marriage under wraps.  Foster is strong, but also vulnerable.  She plays fear just right, attacking it with both shock and awe (""I can't believe this is happening to *me*!"" she appears to be saying, mouth agape, during some of the more tense moments).  And she's funny when she needs to be.  Her chemistry with Kristen Stewart is potent.  The two are  convincing as mother and daughter.  Stewart, for her part, gets Sarah's rebelliousness just right, while also showing her understanding that she is still a little girl who needs her mother.  The plot point, regarding Stewart's character, that ultimately makes it necessary for the two to get out of the panic room, is brought along subtly and assuredly.  They never mention the disease she has, or the well-known medication used to keep it in check.  Clues abound, but are never in your face.  The audience member who is paying close attention will appreciate this; the audience member who isn't will become confused.  Fincher trusts his audience.
Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam play the thieves who force Foster and Stewart into the panic room.  They have a definite Keystone Cops feel about them.  Which is actually a refreshing change.  Most real criminals are miles away from being masterminds.  Here, the titular mastermind is Leto's Junior, who sports cornrows in his hair, and has the intellect of a 6-year old.  Or at least that's how it appears at first.  Once Junior's reason for getting inside the room is clear, you understand the character better.  Whitaker is the compassionate brains of the bunch, a security expert with his own reasons for being on the job.  The motivations of these two characters are never plainly laid out, only alluded to as the film goes along.  I appreciate Fincher again trusting his audience, this time relying on their patience.  Yoakam, who's basically playing a quiet by severely demented psychopath with little motivation except a desire to cause havoc, is as menacing here as he was in ""Sling Blade"".  Only a lot funnier.
The film overall is surprisingly funny.  Sometimes too funny.  I'm all for comic relief, and the suspense here is neatly broken up by laughs at just the right places, but the film can't decide sometimes if it is a black comedy or a suspense thriller.  It teeters back and for the between the two, never able to make up its mind.  Fortunately, the suspense is never ruined totally by the abundant jokes.
Fincher's special effects enhanced shots were sometimes necessary and sometimes superfluous.  On the one hand, the film's first third holds several shots that allow the audience to see the size and layout of the house.  It becomes necessary later on, when the machinations of the plot bring on a sense of disorientation.  On the other hand, shots like a quick tour through the filament of a flashlight bulb, felt like the director had a hankering to show off.
Fincher, known for hyper-kinetic title sequences that are breathtaking to watch, pulls another rabbit out of hat here.  Only this one is static and simple, but no less breathtaking.  Giant white letters (I think the font is Times New Roman), three to four stories tall, appear floating in front of a series of Manhattan landmarks (Central Park, Times Square, etc.).  It is a sunny day, the letters blend seamlessly into the live action, and the whole thing is poetic and gorgeous.  It's the film's one concession to expanse, for the remainder is spent cooped up in the claustrophobic brownstone.
Darius Khondji, who quit/was fired midway through filming, usually gives Fincher's dark films a crisp look.  You can always tell what you are looking at through his lens.  Conrad Hall, whose career has been spent mostly as a camera operator (and who has worked twice -- ""Se7en"" & ""Alien: Resurrection"" -- on Khondji-lensed films), stepped up to the plate for his second turn as cinematographer.  The results are hit and miss.  He has trouble handling the shadows in Fincher's world; everything becomes murky and muddled.  However, his work inside the panic room, especially capturing the penetrating blues of Foster and Stewart's eyes, is sublime.
Up until the end, Fincher's film is near perfect, for what it is anyway.  The suspense is toned just right, the surprises jump out at you unexpectedly, and the mood is palpable.  In the final ten minutes, however, one character becomes unbelievably immortal (as ""Friday the 13th""s Jason or Freddy Krueger might), and another makes an out-of-character choice, to set up the deus es machina ending.  Still, even with these two near-fatal flaws, ""Panic Room"" is a fun and frightening good time.  It may not scale the dizzying heights of ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club"", but it's not really trying to.  At what it's trying to do it most definitely succeeds.",1017532800,30,5736,4.908523908523908
1712455,4,B00006681E,"After seeing the trailers for months, I was very eager to see ""The Panic Room,"" but feared that the trailers gave away too much of the plot.  Fortunately, the movie has many surprises and ultimately is a great popcorn movie.  It is also terrific to see Jodie Foster again after a three year absence from the screen (1999's Anna and the King), and in such an accessible movie.  Jodie plays a newly separated New Yorker who moves, with her 11-year-old daughter, into a great old Brownstone in Manhattan.  The apartment features a panic room with concrete and steel-reinforced walls.  The action starts right away and continues to build throughout the movie.  The plot is fairly simplistic, but director David Finch manages to milk it for all it's worth by employing great camera trickery, including some fantastic shots where the camera zooms from floor to floor in the house, through key holes, etc.
On the negative side, the characters are not well-developed and we know very little about Jodie and her daugher.  Action movies obviously don't need to have characters as fully developed as do dramas, but it still would be nice to have more multi-layered characters.  Also, the burglars are exceedingly stupid and single-minded, particularly Jared Leto who displays some horrific overacting.  Overall, however, I enjoyed the movie a great deal, as did the audience with whom I saw the movie.",1017446400,11,1390,4.982683982683983

7962014,4,B00006681E,"No spoilers here.  Excellent film with Jodie Foster fighting the bad guys.  The movie keeps you tense as you are trapped with Jodie and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) inside the small, gloomy panic room, which feels just as much of a prison as it is a safe place.  Having a panic room sounds interesting, but thanks to this film, it is worth asking yourself if when entering a panic room, could you be walking into your own grave?",1525046400,,436,4.493670886075949

7962019,1,B00006681E,"Great performances by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto (sp?) and Dwight Yoakum as the bad guys are the only reason to watch this turkey. When the bad guys steal the show, you know you have a problem.

The film making cheats constantly, Foster's character walks on broken glass but no blood. Her kid is diabetic, but there's not a cracker or a juice box to be found.

Jody Foster arcs between playing a zombie and channeling Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. Hint: she's only credible as a zombie, and the scene where she tells two cops there is nothing wrong is just embarrassing.

I cannot imagine anyone giving this more than two stars, Whitaker, Leto and Yoakum deserved a better writer and a better director and we deserved a better actress.",1520726400,,734,4.674418604651163
7962020,2,B00006681E,The movie was entertaining and suspenseful but suspend all disbelief while watching.  The bumbling criminals are dumb as rocks and Jodi Fosters character misses a ton of opportunities to turn the table on these idiots.  I give it 2 stars for entertainment value.  The idiotic characters were just too much for my taste so I cant rate it higher.,1520294400,,344,4.796610169491525
