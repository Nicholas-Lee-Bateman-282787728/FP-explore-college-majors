8541660,1,B009HUV97W,"The DVD itself was good quality, the movie theme was horrible, who directed this movie or made up the story line was not even close to being realistic..Don't waste your money on this one, you will be sorry if you do",1375660800,,215,4.2682926829268295
8541661,5,B009HUV97W,"You can tell that there wasn't a million dollar budget, yet the actors and crew gave it their all. I liked the story line and I think they all did a great job. Anyway, the film is like a 2013 Bonnie and Clyde with a twist. I look forward to seeing more work from Tray Chaney and the young lady I've never heard of but she was great too. And pretty!",1375315200,,348,3.915492957746479
8541662,1,B009HUV97W,"Lorenzo (Tray Chaney) and Monica (Natasha 'Breezy' Malone) go on a crime spree and like to be photographed. The opening scene is the plot spoiler ending. The film is part of a flashback told by Lorenzo. It somehow includes the subplot of Cedric, the detective (Ian Novick). Both of our criminals have poorly developed daddy issues. They rob low income mom and pop shops and hide out with a police snitch.

The film is low budget. It is ill conceived, poorly written, and with horrible dialouge used on actors who can't deliver them. The action is light and most of the film is Lorenzo and Monica talking about life etc. Even the previews are boring.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, near sex, no nudity.",1367193600,,703,4.7073170731707314
