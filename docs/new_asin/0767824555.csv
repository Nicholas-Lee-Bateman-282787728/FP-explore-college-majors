23019,3,0767824555,"Charles 'Chuck' Bronson has often been criticised for his minimalist acting style, mainly in the action thrillers he did with Michael Winner, but he is put to effective use in this solid drama, which is a solid debut  for action director, Walter Hill and it also boasts a terrific supporting  performance from that other veteran, James Coburn as the gambler who  becomes Bronson's aide. Chuck's character, Chaney, may not say much, but  you can tell just how he feels by looking at the expressions on his craggy  face, something which Bronson, like Eastwood, can convey convincingly. But  it's the fights themselves that are the highlights, the best one being the  battle in the cage between Bronson and leering, cocky punk, Robert Tessier.  The last fight is good, as well, and Bronson sure does move nimbly for a  fifty four year old!",951782400,5,836,4.872340425531915
23020,5,0767824555,"Portrayal of a quiet humble street fighter that drifts into New Orleans, hooks up with Coburn a slick but loosing gambler who sets up his street fights.  Bronson at his best.  Great settings and depictions of the area  and times.  Very Good supporting cast especially Strother Marting who plays  his cocaine addicted ex medical student role with humor and compasion.  Portrayed as violent but not nearly so by todays action picture standards.",938304000,10,442,5.069444444444445
23021,4,0767824555,"Old stone-face Bronson wasn't always like that, although he certainly was in this movie, which I think is his best by quite a long shot (although I did like ""Chato's Land"", ""Death Hunt"", and ""The Mechanic"" quite a bit).  Centered in or around New Orleans in the depression era, the film is about  men who earn their living as bare-fisted street fighters, and one of the  best is an unknown fighter played by Charles Bronson.  James Colburn is  great as his sleezy manager in trouble with the mob.  This is a highly  entertaining movie with some good performances (even Bronson's) along with  a realistic view of the era.  Between 1 and 10, ""Hard Times"" gets a  well-deserved 8.",928886400,17,677,4.661016949152542

23048,5,0767824555,"One friend found this movie drab and depressing .  Well, that's true I guess .  It is also a great movie due to its several memorable spoken lines, action scenes of bare knuckle fighting for money that put you on the edge of your seat ,  the way the hero tries to woo the woman without taking any guff from her,  the contrast between grim economic survival and living it up,  the man of appearances and the man of genuine character ....
  There is loyalty,  treachery, criminality,  kindness, courage, love,  brains  and the flavor of  Depression-era New Orleans .  Great acting .

Yes, it's about street fighting for money, but it's also about so much more -- character, honesty, loyalty... and it's a realistic reflection of the real hard times of the American Great Depression. Also, of course, there's the solid acting by James Coburn, Strother Martin, Jill Ireland, and Bronson himself. It's good to see these people in roles that exhibit their talent.",1508889600,3,585,4.634615384615385

23128,5,0767824555,"No spoliers, even though this is a 40 year old film.

Great great tough guy movie,
no more excuse to just catch 1/2 of it on TV once every few years, when the DVD is out there for $12.

I'm going back through my list of all time favorite movies searching for the DVDs, or even better Bluerays to get,
and this one is on the short list.

There's something dystopian about 1970's movies that I really like,
maybe not relating to this specific film,
but the good guy doesn't always win, and we don't always get to know why things are the way they are.

There was no presumed happy ending back then, and no assumption of a neat little 15 minute wrap up at the end of the movie.

Bad stuff happens, and we might even leave everything hanging right at the end.

Again may or may not be specific to this movie,
that's 1/2 the joy of movies from this era.

Watch this one and enjoy great acting by Bronson, Coburn and Jill Ireland
as a rental, when it comes up on Prime again,
or jusy buy the DVD to rewatch again and again like me.

23156,3,0767824555,If anyone ever made a career out of playing tough guys.  It was Charles Bronson.  He had been in a lot of classic movies like The Great Escape and Once Upon A Time In The West.  But He didn't really become a star until Death Wish when he was in his fifties or something.  So in this he plays a bare knuckle brawler trying to survive in the Great Depression.  It is a very good role for him.  And along the way he meets up with James Coburn.  They had both been in The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven.  And are a good team in this.  It shows  that Bronson iis a better actor then he was given credit for a lot of time.,1493164800,2,624,3.92

Bronson, James Coburn and Strother Martin shine in this Depression-era tale of mythmaking in action. The initial dialogue between Cheney (Bronson) and Speed (Coburn) over a tray of oysters in a New Orleans dive is one of my all-time favorite expository openings. ""Every bar's got someone in it thinks he's a tough as a nickel-steak, but they all come to Speed for the Do-Re-Mi."" I was hooked right there.",1470873600,5,591,5.040816326530612

funny thing about that old house is it sat vacant for years and years in a cow field with the windows painted over in white paint and then they use it for one of my favorite movies. You can see some of the white paint on the door glasses where they did not scrape it off . this house was located in St Bernard Parish on St Bernard Highway in Meraux La. a lot of the  French quarter scenes were shot at the cornstalk hotel in the Quarter. I have stayed there, I realized later on when watching this years later it was the Cornstalk. Unmistakable from the corn stalk detail on the fence tops.

Favorite line in the movie ""Let's go get the cat""

23436,5,0767824555,"Bronson is always good, so I thought I'd give Hard Times a try. Bronson needs to make some dough, so he agrees to do some fights, and he's good. Meanwhile, he meets a girl. So there's behind the scenes drama surrounding the fights and there's the budding relationship. All of this keeps it interesting, and the ending was a pleasant surprise. As for the characters, Bronson was as good as ever. None of the actors disappointed. --Roger Weston, author of The Recruiter",1452556800,,467,4.7073170731707314

23516,5,0767824555,"Excellent entertainment.  Set in the Depression era.  Forerunner of bare knuckle fighting movies such as Any Which Way But Loose. Stoic performance by Bronson who plays Cheney who is down and out on his luck, but is ""tough as a nickel steak"" when it comes to brawling.  James Coburn also gives us a great performance as the bookie/promoter Speed.  What a voice and quotable lines, e.g. ""They all come to Speed for the Do Re Me!!""  ""That's exactly what I thought you'd say.""  Jill Ireland [Bronson's wife] is attractive and helps set the tone of the times, but is a bit superfluous as Cheney's on and off again love interest.  Strother Martin plays the cut man Poe and pulls off another great character performance.  You will not be disappointed.",1445904000,,745,4.72093023255814

This movie derives its high rating from the two legends and of course Strother Martin is no slouch either as a supporting actor.  Otherwise, there isn't much more to it.  Four stars for the nostalgia that Coburn and Bronson bring to the table, otherwise its pretty weak.  When you compare the fight scenes in an older movie like this to something like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you can see how sophisticated the fight choreography has become over the years.

23835,5,0767824555,"Though this movie was a tiny bit formulaic designed to capitalize on Bronson's tough-guy image, we had a lot of ""tough-guy-loner"" films in the 70's apparently to supplant the ""flower power"" years of the 60's lol.  My only complaint?  Bronson has to include Jill Ireland in the cast, (not to worry Clint E did the same thing with his own not-so-talented actress/wife in the 70's) the rest of the cast was spot-on good acting that makes up for Miss Ireland's paper-plate performance.

One of the greatest character actors to ever be photographed, Strother Martin plays Poe, the hop-head med school dropout ""doctor"" to James Coburn's fast talking sleazy street-hustling fight promoter: Speed.  Charles Bronson plays the tough, mysterious Chaney... no last name... no past, future: unknown but with a present filled iron hard fists in private 'fight club"" type fights.

Though this film is some 40 years old, and I actually saw it the first time as a teen in a tough Port Arthur, Texas theater - it's a visual delight for those that enjoy the look and feel of the 1930's and stories about men caught up in the day to day struggle to survive in the bottom rungs of society in an America that was tougher, grittier, dirtier and harder than the one we live in now.

Overall the picture is a great period piece, showing the grime of Depression Era New Orleans, you can almost smell the French Quarter, and the even grittier dispositions of the hard people it took to survive the era, anyway they could beginning with the most basic two-man survival tests ever - a fight.  When his gal-pal asks Bronson what he does for a living the character replies: ""I knock people down"".  Survival at it's basest.

Two of my favorite scenes are: at the Cajun Fais Do Do, and the workmanlike, un-emotional yet charming way Bronson is forced to collect his winnings that night and then the final goodbye at the finale.

Keep an eye on Strother Martin as ""Poe"", enjoy an uncredited cameo performance by the ""Preservation Hall Band"", and try to understand Bronson's hard, loner character and the surprising ending to Hard Times.",1433203200,,2102,4.765840220385675

Never a fan of James Coburn, he did an excellent job in the role of Speed.  Strother Martin (you might have seen him in Cool Hand Luke; if not, I recommend it) is fun to watch.  Jill Ireland was...well, not at her best, but then she didn't have much of a role.  The tone of the movie is outstanding: it really captures the tough grittiness of the Great Depression era.

There has to be someone out there who was involved with the making of this film who could have given commentary...such a missed opportunity! They could have told us what Charles Bronson was like to work with,his preparation for the movie and how he stayed in shape etc(the guy was nearly 55 when he made this and looked as fit as a professional athlete). ""You had better get the money."" and ""you owe me money."" Two lines delivered by Bronson in the movie in true superstar fashion. Would love to see the deleted fight scenes one day..the DVD has stills of Charlie fighting two opponents that do not appear in any version I have seen(would have been nice if those actors had given their input on the blu ray edition)!Think Charlie should have accepted Walter Hill's ""The Driver""  after this as he would have been perfect in it.

24319,5,0767824555,"I love this movie. Arguably Charles Bronsons best and certainly a great film, a simple, compelling story that is pared down to the bone just like Bronsons chiseled physique. The man was over 50 years old when Hard Times was made and his body looks great. His face too, deeply lined and perfect for the role hes playing of a down-on-his-luck Depression-era drifter with a gift for bare-knuckles fighting.

The whole story is wonderfully understated. There are several instances, for example, when someone says something insulting or provocative to Bronson and its all set up for him to deliver a cheap quip or a comeback. In 9 out of 10 other films, youd get the predictable quip, the comeback. But in Hard Times Bronsons character Chaney doesnt say a word, he just gives a look. Or when fight promoter Speed (James Coburn) tries to rip him off, he just shakes his head sadly and says, Stupid... I love this economy of dialogue. This was Walter Hills directorial debut but he shows real mastery here.

Co-stars James Coburn and Strother Martin are superb. Coburn digs into his role as the hustler fight promoter Speed with lip-smacking relish, barely those big shiny teeth of his. And Martin is perfect as the sort-of doctor with a weakness for the needle. I wasn't so impressed with Jill Ireland, though. She looks out of place in this Depression-era story and her acting is, well, just okay. Ive since read that Bronson got on the outs with Walter Hill because he thought Hill cut out too much of Irelands performance. If so, Hill did right. Ireland isn't so great. Overall, however, the movie remains so good that I cant let this eat into my rating. I have to give Hard Times the full five stars.",1393200000,8,1698,4.6755852842809364

He is ably supported by the fast talking James Coburn and the great old character actor Strother Martin. It is a great insight into the brutal world of illegal 'pick up fights' or bare knuckle streetfighting. Set against the Depression Bronson is a drifter roaming from town to town picking up a money from fights along the way. It is a fairly basic plot, but the explosive fight scenes and the lovable rogue Coburn make this a very enjoyable film. Bronson may be 50 but he's tougher than guys half his age!

24387,5,0767824555,"First off I would like to express that I truly love this film. Secondly in my personal opinion you must have a passion for the recreation of early to mid 1930's films like Bonnie and Clyde,  The Sting, or The Emperor of the north. I have viewed this film on the average of 4 times a year if not more. The first introdution of this film starts off with an excellent musical score as the credits roll. ( A freight train rolling on into a downtown freight yard With Cheney played by Charles Bronson riding in a box car ) With no prospects or as cheney would put it ( I never look beyond the next bend in the road ) Charles Bronson and James Colburn has played together in two films ... The Great Escape and Hard Times ... Both one of the finest actors America has ever produced. With the films fine detail for authenticity like the old model T fords or the downtown streets of new Orleans on bourbon street. Makes you think that you might really be there in the 1930's with sights of the bayou in the 1930's Louisiana and the 1930's old fairy steam boats on the Mississippi river. The characters that Bronson And Colburn play are very strong and convincing. You can relate to both characters as if they were actually real life personalities. This film leaves you from beginning to end completely satisfied all the way to the musical scores final rolling credits. ... P.S. .. This is a very good Down and out, Skid row, Depression era, Hard on your luck type of film. ... I hope you enjoy !!!",1382832000,,1488,4.333333333333333

24390,5,0767824555,"Filmed as The Streetfighter but changed to Hard Times in the US to avoid confusion with Sonny Chiba's movie (though still called The Streetfighter in the UK to avoid any raised eyebrows at Bronson trying his hand at Dickens), this is a terrific little movie that never quite got the attention it deserved in the mid-70s. In many ways it's almost a kind of Depression-era Midnight Cowboy with bare-knuckle brawling replacing the sex-for-sale, as James Coburn's ducking and diving street fight promoter teams up with Bronson's drifter and sees his chance at the big time. Naturally it doesn't work out that way, but en route to the inevitable fall debuting director Walter Hill draws a vivid portrait of people trying to survive in brutal times any way they can - with added brutal fights.

The plot and characters aren't particularly complex, but they're vividly drawn, from Coburn's ability to seize financial disaster from the jaws of triumph when his passion for losing his winnings on the crap tables and borrowing from one loan shark to pay another to Strother Martin's eloquent `cut man' who patches up fighters in return for enough money to indulge his drug habit (""This month's financial condition has prevented certain journeys of the imagination""), while Bronson, as ever, says the most without words as the kind of man who never puts down any roots and never looks past the next bend in the road. There's a rich cast of familiar 70s faces among the supporting cast - Robert Tessier, Bruce Glover, Frank McRae, Felice Orlandi - and an elegant turn from Michael McGuire as Coburn's upmarket rival, almost literally a big fish in a little pond who isn't best pleased that he no longer has the best streetfighter in New Orleans. The plotting, like Hill's visual framing, is straightforward but eloquently economical with no sense of padding or waste, so perfectly crafted that you're never left feeling that you haven't got more than your money's worth.

The kind of film that people seem to have forgotten how to make these days, it's definitely more than the sum of its parts, and Twilight Time's Blu-ray release offers an outstandingly good and detailed transfer that really compliments Philip Lathrop's excellent Scope cinematography.

The rugged, taciturn persona of Bronson naturally fit this character, a character that would likely have those attributes at the time of the Depression. The supporting cast was well chosen- Strother Martin, for one, of fame for intoning the infamous, ""What we have here is failure to communicate"" line of Cool Hand Luke. He was a perfect fit for this film as well. I have only one minor problem with the film and that is an historical inaccuracy. In the opening of the film where Chaney is riding a boxcar into New Orleans, the train locomotive is a diesel. Diesel locomotives were not in use in the time of the Depression and did not appear until the 1950's. Then later, at a train station, steam locomotives are used which were, in the 1930's, in common use. Beyond that, Hard Times is a forgotten jewel of a movie, especially for Bronson fans.

It is the best of Charles Bronson perfecting his one liners. James Coburn gives a great performance as a two bit gambler/promoter addicted to gambling that causes him to lose his girlfriend and nearly his life if Charles Bronson doesn't decide to fight for it. It is one of many movies Charles Bronson has his beautiful wife (Jill Ireland ) play in a movie. The movie has a great array of supporting actors which adds to the movies fantastic script, which includes Robert Tessier, Strother Martin, Michael McGuire, Nick Dimitri, and many more.

This is a superb action movie involving hoods, gangsters and a pretty good depiction of what life was like in Louisiana and New Orleans in the height of ""The Great Depression"" era of our history. It shows the depravity of how far men would go to make enough money just to eat. Men willing to fight just so their families can eat. Cheney (Bronson) comes into town on a box car and will eventually leave on one, but the script only lets on the only thing about him is he is willing to fight dangerous men to make some money, he likes down and out women (Jill Ireland), and cats. He meets  Spencer ""Speed"" Weed (James Coburn) -- an addicted gambler who manages Chaney and facilitates Chaney's quick pocket of money by fighting bare knuckle dangerous men.

24476,5,0767824555,"I've seen this film about 17 times and I never tire of it. It's not only classic gritty 70's cinema, but it's probably Bronson's best movie as lead actor. Well directed by Walter Hill, who also directed classics like The Warriors and 48 hours. Hill brings the depression and New Orleans in the 30's to vivid life. The acting is spot-on, and personally I think this is Bronson's best performance, as well we have James Coburn who hams it up to classic measure. Struther Martin is simply perfect in his role as Poe as well. There is a lot of superbly crafted fist fighting scenes that are some of the very best I can remember ever seeing, and the film is just plain classic 70's cinema, laying somewhere between B film and Big budget 70's movies. This movie is one of those little miracles that comes along once in a long time. Bronson was just great in this as a bare knuckle boxer who seems tough as nails and merciless, but who really has a heart of gold. By the end of the film there's a beautiful message about the bonds of friendship that we can all learn a lesson from. So I've seen it many times and the film still captivates me every time I see it.

Strother Martin appears as the cut man who has a weakness for Opium. Great lost gem.,1359331200,,469,4.402298850574713

In the acutely rendered hard times of the period: Bronson, James Coburn (gambling debt ridden fight manager) and Strother Martin (drunk ex medical student trainer) team up to outwit and outfight local big shot fight promoters, debt collectors and street fighters in a series of debt laden bare knuckle fights. Love interest is provided by various distaff girlfriends (including Bronson's real life wife Jill Ireland), whose relationships with the trio last about as long as the realistic fights - not long. The New Orleans locations and authentic period details of contrasting poverty and wealth add gritty realism to the hard fights that follow. In hard times actions also speak louder than music. The musical score is unobtrusive and except for a Cajun southern gumbo musical riff unremarkable.

24538,5,0767824555,"Set during the Great Depression, Hard Times is easily Charles Bronson's best film.  Without a word, the poverty, ugliness, and grim desperation of a world turned against its people fills the screen from the very beginning.  Bronson, looking out the open door of a slow-moving freight car, watches as a family, all its members and their meager possessions loaded into an old car, waits at a railroad crossing for the train to pass.  Where are they headed?  It hardly matters.  Despair prevails everywhere.  Where is Bronson's character, known only as Chaney, headed?  Same answer.

Chaney is just trying to ""fill in the in-betweens,"" as he cryptically puts it.  As with so many others, he's looking for a way to get by until the world offers some sort of purpose, something better than hungry hopelessness.  Something better than wage labor shucking oysters for too little to live on, surrounded by the sort of stench that hits you hard the first time you walk into an old oyster bar, only worse.  The sort of foulness that gets into your clothes, your hair, your skin, so deep you eventually stop trying to wash it away.

The only things Chaney has going for him are his fists.  Yes, I agree:  it makes no sense that a guy living a hand-to-mouth existence riding the rails should be ""tough as a nickel steak"" (James Coburn's words) and strong as a well-nourished plow horse.  But it makes no sense that a guy who was fifty-four when the movie was made should have a perfect physique.  Not the bulk of a power-lifter or the almost effeminate definition of a broadly smiling, artfully posing, bare-footed body builder, but the sleek, perfectly proportioned, thick-muscled leanness of a natural, somebody who doesn't have to work at it.

Much of Hard Times' appeal is due to the effortlessly effective depiction of the overwhelmingly bleak atmosphere of the Depression Era deep south.  Even more is due to truly fine performances by James Coburn as Speed, Chaney's impulsive, hot-headed, but resourceful manager, and Strother Martin as Poe, the courtly southern gentleman cut man, with a scholarly interest in comparative religion, a fondness for opium, and an understanding of friendship.

Chaney and Speed meet by chance near a train stop in an unidentified town where Speed's muscular hitter takes a beating, losing Speed money in club fight betting.  When Chaney approaches him, Speed is dubious.  Chaney is too old, too down-and-out, too typical of out-of-luck bare-knuckled brawlers looking for sponsorship.

Against his better judgment, and with Chaney's last six dollars as collateral, Speed gets him a fight with the last man standing, the same one who just finished off Speed's current lackluster representative in the make-shift club fighting ring.  Dismissed by his much younger, confidently smirking opponent as ""grandpa,"" Chaney takes him out with one punch.  Stunned silence.

Speed takes Chaney to New Orleans, where he lives with his ""permanent fiance', ably play by a little-known actress named Maggie Bligh, one of the most appealing women I've ever seen on film.  When his live-in lady inquires as to Chaney's identity, Speed replies, ""money on the hoof.""

In New Orleans Chaney turns out to be a bit less desperate than Speed had assumed, and he's an uncompromising negotiator. After quoting going shares for club fighters and their managers, Speed accepts Chaney's terms, and he's happy to do so.

In an old-New Orleans series of encounters, set first in a Black church with a real-life chorus and then moved to a nearby cemetery, Poe is recruited as a ten percent cut man, and Speed begins deftly, and with annoyingly obvious self-satisfaction, arranging some big fights for serious money.

Sometimes Chaney is too good.  His characterization as a ""ringer"" by a quickly dispatched opponent's sponsor is used as an excuse not to pay up.  But Chaney proves to be too determined and resourceful to let that happen.

The fight scenes between Chaney and hitters played by Robert Tessier and Nick Dimitri are the best I've ever seen on film.  Whoever choreographed them deserves an Oscar.

Along the way we see that there is more to Speed than greed and impulsive recklessness; more to Poe than his ancestry (""the great Edgar Allen"") and his love of opium, and more to Chaney than good fists that he'd just as soon not use.  All this is handled in a satisfyingly low-key way, with unspoken intimations rather than in-your-face announcements and loud protestations.  The brief scene near the very end involving the warriors Tessier and Dimitri is remarkably understated and touching.

Nothing lasts forever.  Chaney leaves New Orleans, again in a freight car, as Speed and Poe, marking his departure, acknowledge that ""he was really somethin'.""

I'm pretty sure that I over-value Hard Times.  But the role of Chaney fits Charles Bronson like his bare-knuckled skin, and James Coburn and Stroher Martin are superb, as is the rest of the supporting cast.  Even Bronson's wife, Jill Ireland, whom he included in all his films until she succumbed to breast cancer, is better than usual.  Hard Times is about just that -- hard times.

24564,3,0767824555,"I've lately been buying dvd's to fill-in my Charles Bronson favorites, and watched ""Hard Times"" (1975) last night.
I suppose if you're a fan of Charles Bronson, this period piece from the Great Depression, about a bare-knuckles fighter trying to earn a few bucks from fights (to ""fill in the inbetweens"") doesn't need either another review, or any particular recommendation. The following comments are just to ""fill-in"" a few things about this relatively little-known film, from the perspective of a life-long Bronson fan, who always has thought Charlie could have been an even bigger motion-picture star than he was, given the right vehicle for his unique acting talents.

The plot of ""Hard Times"" has been well-outlined by the 70+ other reviews already posted to this site, so I won't detail that with more than a brief summary. Suffice it to say, the story is very simple, the outcome rather predictable, and the story also rather brief ( 93 minutes total), and other than for Bronson fans, is likely to have some appeal to boxing fans, and those who enjoy a well-crafted period piece. Chaney (Bronson) arrives hitching a freight-train, and quickly hooks up with Spencer Weed, aka ""Speed""- James Coburn doing his usual excellent job of yet another suave, rakish opportunist: this time as a promoter of illegal bare-knuckle fights. The rest of the story consists of no more than 4 separate fight scenes, with a concluding one against a hired-gun fighter from Chicago. In between is a side-story of Chaney's relationship with Lucy Simpson (Bronson's real life wife, actress Jill Ireland, who appeared with him in many of his films), a lonely local woman with a husband serving some jail time, and a parallel side-story of Speed's troubles with the local loan sharks, who are after his hide, as he is always in debt from his semi-successful hustling.

Many feel this is Bronson's best acting role, even though I think the Chaney character is rather underdeveloped in this film. This is quintessential Bronson: tough guy with a heart, and VERY few words. For my money, as far as Bronson's acting chops go, I thought ""Death Wish"" allowed him to display a much wider, more believable range of emotions that what he is asked to do in ""Hard Times"". However, Bronson's physical persona has always been his strength as an actor, and in ""Hard Times"", the then 54 year old Bronson displays as amazing quickness of foot, along with a pretty devastating right hand. He's a very believable pugilist, though the two main fight scenes are a bit heavy on the every-punch-hits-the-guy-right-between-the-eyes-yet-he-stays-up thing. What would have made this film a 5 star prospect for me was if the director had made this movie about 20-30 minutes longer, and devoted more time to developing not only Chaney's enigmatic, appealing character, but also those of the several other principal actors as well.

As an example: Poe (the accomplished character actor Strother Martin) is employed by Speed to be Chaney's ""ring-side doctor""- we are told in Speed's introduction that he is a good cut man, etc- yet for the rest of the movie, we never see Poe do a single thing for Chaney, during any of his fights. We are told he is an opium addict (like his literary namesake), yet that also never figures into either his character or the story, in any way.

Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland) is given almost nothing to say or do, in her relationship with Chaney. We are led to believe there must be some romantic attraction between the two, but we are never shown any actual romance. We are led to believe they eventually separate because of Chaney's stand-offishness, but that isn't developed very well in their scenes together either. I thought the whole sideline story of their brief relationship could have added a lot of depth to both Chaney's character and this movie, but unless it's lying somewhere on the editing room floor, those scenes jusy never happen in this film.

The additional supporting actors, filling out the roles of Chaney's and Speed's fighting/promoter competition (Michael McGuire as wealthy-looking promoter Chick Gandil, Robert Tessier and Nick Dimitri as Chaney's two most formidable ring opponents) are done well enough, ironically. The main characters (other than Coburn's admittedly engaging take on Speed) could have used a lot more work, though.

In all, I'd rate this a 3.5 star movie, mainly for the atmospheric recreation of the Depression Era, and the shots of New Orleans, where most of the story takes place, and yes, the acting of Bronson and Coburn, and to a much lesser extent Ireland and Martin. It's worth watching once, but probably worth purchasing only for Bronson film fans, like me.

What I'd really like to see, if it in fact even exists, is a ""director's cut"" of ""Hard Times"", with about 30 more minutes of run time. With a little more flesh and blood tacked onto a few of the main characters, this would have potential to be a real classic.",1285286400,3,4960,4.918757467144564

24570,5,0767824555,"He don't talk much, doesn't Charles Bronson. Clint Eastwood, by comparison, is considered a chatterbox. First time director Walter Hill puts Bonson's trademark laconism to very good use in HARD TIMES, probably my favorite Charles Bronson picture. HARD TIMES strays from Bronson's shoot-'em-up formulas, although it does have its share of action sequences. But this film is more a gritty period piece and a low-key character study. Its enigmatic central character plays to Bronson's tight-lipped, no-nonsense persona. Some folks don't think Charles Bronson was much of an actor. But his spare performances always led me to believe there were hidden reserves, something of consequence going on, beneath the inscrutable expression and the lack of loquaciousness. To me, this translated a subtle depth to his characters, that merely by Bronson's weathered presence, a back story is intuited.

Chaney is a drifter, riding the rails, and like everyone else struggling mightily during the Great Depression. He eventually ends up in New Orleans where he tries to build up a nest egg by engaging in bare knuckle brawls. He lands a shifty promoter named Speed, who at first looks him over and observes: ""You look a little past it."" As played by James Coburn, Speed is always working a hustle and flashes that toothy grin. Speed is a rogue, and he has an interesting dynamics with Chaney. Coburn and Bronson play off each other beautifully, Coburn's brash likable heel striking a nice counterpoint to Bronson's craggy -faced dude of few words.

We go into the film not knowing much about Chaney. He exits with us still in the dark about his past. We know that he likes cats, that money motivates him, although he does show kindness towards and even halfway courts a lovely but cynical woman (played by his real wife Jill Ireland). We learn that he does demonstrate a reluctant loyalty towards his manager pal, and that he's not as much of an underdog as initially perceived. At the end of the film we realize just how much of a hard mo-fo he is. In a way, Chaney is a precursor to other cinematic over-the-hill fighters like ""Honey"" Roy Palmer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diggstown/dp/B000035P5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diggstown</a>) and Jerry Ferro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hammer/dp/B00151QYFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hammer</a>).

Charles Bronson was one of the top box office draws in 1975, having just scored big the year before with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B0000541AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>. He was 53 years old when he shot HARD TIMES and was still in phenomenal shape. He always did have a chiseled figure, and he looks amazing here and did most of his own stunts. Yet he also sported that face that was so rugged and weathered it looked like a Thomas Guide map (but a Thomas Guide map that could smack you across the room). Somewhere Lance Henriksen is probably jealous.

I like that HARD TIMES doesn't try to sermonize about the human condition. That sort of message usually goes over better if it's not being beaten into your head. The movie allows you to read between the lines, lets you make connections without them being pounded into you with pretentious exposition. I like that there's a kind of code of honor amongst these shady characters. There's no real animosity among the fighters. It's all business, making money, surviving and moving on. When Speed fails to pay off his debt, he gets a visit from the loan shark's enforcers, who then takes it out on his car. Speed protests feebly, but he's just going thru the motions. He minds, but he doesn't really mind. It's what's expected. Chaney, by virtue of his enigmatic, laconic presence, achieves an almost mythic aura. He's not quite up there with the Man with No Name, but Chaney, a kindred spirit and fellow mysterious loner, can sidle up to a bar next to him and won't be rebuffed.

There's convincing attention to detail dedicated to the look and feel of the film. Thanks to this, a strong supporting cast, and a taut script, I could feel the palpable reek of desperation from these characters, hard men and women eking out and making do in the poverty-ridden climate of 1930s America. I like that the fights, staged in dank warehouses and on seedy piers, are well-choreographed and don't come off as too showy. Chaney and his opponents are honest fighters - even the bald and intimidating and disconcertingly grinny Jim Henry (Robert Tessier) - and I soaked in the grueling, no-nonsense brutality. HARD TIMES is an unsentimental, tough-minded period melodrama. It's also a great fight movie.",1257638400,,4744,5.26984126984127

He obviously had boxed before and knew how to box.  He liked to do his own stunt work, and this movie shows it.

I have the WS/FS version. The transfer is not very good; the soundtrack is mono, and does not do justice to the film. Technical issues aside, the movie is flawless. It has no special features.

If you're going to like this movie, you'll know it from the opening sequence: silence up to a diesel's rumble & whistle on the way into New Orleans; imagery to match.

Every element--acting, directing, writing, music, cinematography--is pitch-perfect. The music, in particular, is fabulous. Folk, cajun/zydecoe, dixieland, an extraordinary black gospel sequence. The location shooting, too: riverside warehouse, industrial interiors, barges and ferries, bayou community life, flop house, oyster house, Latin Quarter. Period street scenes, gorgeous automobiles, prohibition night life. You can practically smell the booze, sweat,  shellfish and tobacco smoke.

The leads are truly wonderful: Bronson, Coburn, Strother Martin and Jill Ireland. So is the supporting cast.

There are many comments about the fight scenes, and I suppose they are good, but that's not what makes the movie for me. The protagonist (Bronson/Chaney) fights for money, not pleasure. He prefers knocking other people down to being himself knocked down, but he doesn't enjoy it.

Chaney has the self-confidence that comes from being good at what he does. He supports himself with his fighting, but does not live for it. Chaney lives for ""the in-betweens."" He is a drifter because being settled in hard times gives him no satisfaction; Chaney is an upright man in a beat-down time. His mannerisms are not genteel, though his spirit is. He does not say much, but his actions are compelling.

""Hard Times"" is an old-fashioned movie about honor, loyalty, and decency and a great way to spend evening.",1224374400,,1788,5.249122807017544
24597,3,0767824555,"Overall, a reasonably high quality, no frills, DVD. My main criticism is that the full screen format left out a lot of detail at the periphery, for instance in the scene when Chaney (Bronson) challenges Pettibon's Cajun fighter. In the dispute after the fight all we hear is the click of a gun, we are left to assume from the there is an armed man because he is totally invisible. Likewise when Chaney shoots up Pettibon's honkytonk, some of the time he is aiming at invisible targets like the old fashioned pay phone on the wall (I only know this because I remember seeing this film at a movie theater back in the 70's. To appreciate what you are missing you have to compare the wide aspect opening scene (when Chaney hops off a freight train) with the rest of the film. I imagine they only transferred the opening scene in 2.35:1 so that you can read the titles. A wide aspect ratio is important when there is a lot of dynamic action going on and lets face it it's the fight scenes that are the most important part of the movie.

24627,5,0767824555,"""Hard Times"" a film directed by Walter Hill, takes place in New Orleans during the Great Depression.

We never really learn any of the vital statistics of Chaney (portrayed by Charles Bronson).  Like a lot of able- bodied men at this time, he is a drifter out of work.  We don't know where he is from or where he going.  His profession, relatives and family are a mystery.  He says little and only what he means to say.

Chaney idly wanders into an illicit prize fight.  This isn't a boxing arena with its Marquis of Queensbury rules.  This is bare knuckle street fighting where there are no referees and few rules.  Head butts, biting and kicking along with kidney punches are perfectly legal.  Each fighter works with a gambler.  Odds are given and bets are taken.  Then the mayhem begins.

Observing this, Chaney gets an idea.  He approaches a gambler a man named Spencer ""Speed' Weed (James Coburn in one of his greatest roles) and pitches a partnership.  Speed sets up the fights, takes up the bets, Chaney wins the fights.

Speed has his doubts about Chaney's capabilities.  Chaney is too old.  But he does have a calmly confident manner about him.  He reluctantly fronts for Chaney when Chaney puts every penny he has on the line.

One thing we learn immediately about Chaney.  This middle-aged man can obliterate opponents.  He is hard but not sadistic.  He just doesn't believe wasting time or anything else.  Chaney is the kind of man all men wished they could be.  He is cool and collected regardless of the situation.  While we immediately know he can take care of himself, the only question is will he take care of anyone else?

Speed is impressed.  With Chaney, his luck has changed for the better.  As brilliantly portrayed by James Coburn, Speed can be a pain in the behind.  He's loud, he can be irritatingly smooth.  He the kind of guy driving an expensive car, wearing a Rolex, diamonds and a silk suit with a smile that shows everyone of his 88 teeth.

But he won't have a dime in his pocket.....

The supporting cast is brilliant including Strother (...""failure to communicate."") Martin of ""Cool Hand Luke"" fame.  He plays Poe a failed junky ex-medical student hired to be Chaney's cut man distinguished intellectual gentle manner.  Jill Ireland plays Chaney's `romantic' interest, Lucy Simpson.  (This film was made not too long after Charles Bronson stole her from David McCallum while they were making ""The Great Escape"".  But I digress.)

 The ensemble cast is rounded out by Michael McGuire who plays Chick Gandil.  Chick is the arch rival of Speed.  He is wealthy but his passion is not the family business but gambling.

""Hard Times"" is about the effects of adversity not street fighting during the Depression.  The Great Depression provides the adversity.  Under adversity we all find out our substance.  We learn who we are who our enemies are and who are friends are.  In adversity, we are stripped to the core of our being.  There is no veneer left, no false fronts. Everything is out there on the table.

The fights are just a metaphor.  Just like the men in the fights, if all you had were only two hands and some guts would you triumph?  What rules would you play by? What kind of character would you show in victory?  What kind of character would you show in defeat?

As the movie progresses we see each of the principle characters bare-chested with their dukes up.  How they handle adversity and rise to the occasion is the essence of this remarkable film and its joy.",1194393600,,3505,4.660655737704918
24628,5,0767824555,"Charles Bronson plays Chaney, a street-smart, aging bare-knuckle boxer, who arrives in town as a hobo on a train.  He has little money, great brawn and grit - and enough wisdom to observe and learn with little reason for small talk.  While having coffee at a downtown diner, he notices activity in a nearby building.  Watching a no-holds barred street-fight, he realizes he can win and make some easy money.  James Coburn plays Speed, the two-bit promoter who books Chaney in street fights in small towns.  Chaney has a soft side, trying to find love and adopting a stray cat, with scenes showing he cares for it.  He is briefly involved in a love affair with the lovely Lucy, Jill Ireland - Bronson's real-life wife.  This goes nowhere, Lucy wants stability, but Speed is strong and knows one gets hurt in life by showing feelings and forming relationships, even with a cat. So, it is back to a final gut-wrenching fight to show if Chaney is really as good as he thinks.

Even though this film is focused on male prowess and survival, it pulls its weight as a great drama and has fantastic performances by all. The movie keeps a steady strong pace, and Bronson and Coburn play on each other with great synergy meant for these rolls.  Strother Martin, as Poe, is perfect sidekick and doctor of sorts.  Robert Tessier, plays a great role as the toughest fighter that Bronson floors. He has tattoos and bald head with perfect face for fighter and grit of expressions.

24651,4,0767824555,"""Hard Times"" was Walter Hill's 1975 directorial debut. He also wrote the screenplay. His preferred (more accurate and better) title was ""The Streetfighter,"" as it was/is known in Europe. Hill went on to do more popular films like ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""The Long Riders"" (1980). The reason I was interested in checking out ""Hard Times"" is because it had garnered a bit of a cult reputation over the years (although not as cult-ish as ""The Warriors"").

THE PLOT: Charles Bronson plays a poor drifter/loner, Chaney, during the Depression who travels by boxcar to New Orleans. He spies an illegal bare-knuckle fight in a warehouse and offers his fighting talents to a fast-talking gambler, Speed (James Coburn). Chaney proves himself a formidable and profitable fighter, but Speed can't hold on to money because of his gambling addiction and is in constant trouble with the mob.

One thing that's amazing is that Bronson was 53 freakin' years-old when the film was made, yet physically looks better than most guys half that age. Bronson's beautiful wife, Jill Ireland, plays his love interest (as usual) and was 39 years old at the time.

Although very little is revealed in the film about Chaney's past (we know he had experience as a coal miner), it becomes fairly certain that he had a lot of experience with bare knuckle fighting. We know this because he is supremely confident of his skills despite his age. Chaney is not big or ultra-muscular, but he's fearless, calmly self-controlled, doesn't bleed easy and expertly knows how to READ other fighters. Chaney's weakness is that he's a loner and doesn't talk much, hence he NEEDS Speed to do the talkin' for him and set up matches in order to make money from his uncommon skills.

I first saw ""Hard Times"" two years ago and thought it was decent, but I didn't quite get the 'great cult film' hoopla. Perhaps I wasn't prepared for the ugly/dirty Depression era sets and New Orleans locations; or maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a fight film. I just saw it again, however, and appreciate it more.

""Hard Times"" has numerous memorable scenes, lines and characters. I was entertained throughout its 90 minute runtime -- grinning, frequently busting out laughing and even clapping (huh?). Speaking of the runtime, I love it when pictures aren't needlessly overlong.

Here's one sample of some of the great dialogue: Chaney's date asks him what he does for a living. Chaney simply responds that he makes money by knocking people down. She mockingly asks, ""What does it feel like to knock somebody down?"" He brilliantly replies, ""It makes me feel a hell of a lot better than it does him.""

Although Chaney is depicted as a likable, honorable, bold and compassionate person, his downfall is that he is unable to make long-term commitments, preferring to be ""free"" and mysterious. [SPOILER ALERT! -- THE REMAINDER OF THIS PARAGRAPH AND THE NEXT TWO] Because of this flaw he ultimately loses his beautiful girl to someone else. He then leaves New Orleans as mysteriously as he came, albeit now a streetfighting legend and carrying a lot of cash.

The ending leaves many questions to ponder: What prompts Chaney to change his mind and try to save Speed by taking on an expert fighter from Chicago? Didn't Speed dig his own pit? Chaney himself angrily told Speed that he didn't owe him anything. Perhaps, as Chaney laid on his bed under the ceiling fan in his dump of an apartment, he realized that maybe he DID owe Speed for granting him the opportunity to utilize his talents and make money. In other words, without Speed he wouldn't have had his success. Perhaps he decided he wanted to make even MORE money in one final fight before leaving New Orleans. Possibly, it dawned on him that, although Speed is certainly to blame for his own problems, Chaney realized that he had fallen into his OWN-dug pits in the past and needed someone to help him get out. Or maybe he realized that, in all the world, he had less friends than can be counted on three fingers and felt it was his duty to help Speed (and Poe) out.

Regardless of his reasons, the ending expertly shows Chaney's loyal and generous character. He may be a man of few words, but he certainly CARED about those connected to him, even if they were severely flawed addicts and con-artists. Heck, he even LOVED his cat!

But on to a modest review....

Hill's attention to detail is so sophisticated in this film it belies his youth and inexperience (I'd imagine in 1975) as a director. Apart from the fact that Charles Bronson, at 54 years of age, has the physical presence that would shame a 25 year old fitness fanatic he manages to pull off a seminal performance portraying a mercenary character from the Kurosawa stable with authenticity.

24658,3,0767824555,"This movie earns 5 stars, but I give it a 3 because the DVD itself is a 1 or 2.

I've never been a big fan of Bronson -- who even as tough-guy action heroes go had the range of a Daisy air rifle -- but the role of Chaney in this film is perfect for his tight-lipped, minimal style.

There's no need to add further details of this great man's man cinema beyond what others have already said. Suffice to say it's a sorely needed if temporary anachronistic antidote to this emasculated age of Oprah, metrosexuals, reality shows, and self-help guides. It'd be a good double feature with Emperor of The North Pole or Fight Club. A good, tight, no-nonsense story that doesn't pull any punches or make apologies.

The problem with this DVD is the DVD itself. The print is actually decent for a straight 35mm transfer with only a handful of grainy and artifact-ridden scenes. Audio is passable. The big problem is that it's not letterboxed -- entirely pan-and-scan, and noticeably so. It's time the studio pressed a widescreen version and cleaned it up a bit.

A couple bonus features wouldn't hurt either, but that would just be the proverbial icing. Unfortunately we've lost all of the lead actors so a retrospective would be tough to put together.",1135987200,10,1242,4.606334841628959

Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Walter Hill were never better.  No car chases, no cardboard villians, no vigilante executions......just a great story deftly told.",1110067200,8,389,4.878787878787879
24686,4,0767824555,"Hard Times is a great movie that for whatever reason has never got as much attention as other Charles Bronson and James Coburn movies.  The movie tells the story of a strong, silent street figther, Chaney, who travels to New Orleans in 1933 during the midst of the Great Depression to make some money doing what he does best, ""knocking people down.""  Chaney teams up with boxing promoter and street hustler Speed Weed.  Immediately, Chaney destroys anyone he goes up against.  As Chaney's reputation continues to rise, Speed has money problems that begin to cause more problems than Chaney ever anticipated.  The street fights in this movie are brutal, vicious, knock down fights that are beautiful and horrifying at the same time.  Unlike many action movies, Hard Times does not rely solely on the action.  There is a well-told story with characters that we come to care and learn a lot about by the end of the movie. Just a great movie overall.

  Charles Bronson gives an excellent performance as Chaney, the strong, silent street fighter trying to make a buck.  Roles like this show Bronson's acting ability and that he wasn't just a tough guy, although he more than holds his own in this movie.  James Coburn is equally as good as Spencer ""Speed"" Weed, Chaney's promoter who always has trouble holding onto money.  Bronson's real-life wife Jill Ireland plays Lucy, Chaney's girlfriend who is looking for security in her life.  In a smaller role, Strother Martin plays Poe, an opium-addicted medic working with Chaney and Speed.  The movie also stars Michael McGuire as big-time gambler and heavy Chick Gandil, Felice Orlandi, Edward Walsh, Margaret Blye, Bruce Glover, Robert Tessier, and Nick Dimitri.  The DVD offers widescreen and fullscreen presentations, and trailers from Hard Times and The Stone Killer, another Bronson movie.  For an excellent movie with great performances from Bronson and Coburn with a well-told story and plenty of action, check out Hard Times!",1107043200,6,1977,5.015337423312883
24687,4,0767824555,"Walter Hill's 1975 directorial debut ""Hard Times"" is about as predictable as a ""Lone Ranger"" radio serial. It's also one of the most esthetically perfect action films you are ever going to see. I'm not sure if there is a single original idea or thought in this Depression era bare-knuckled boxing tale, but it is blessed with a style and verve that raises its level of respectability several notches.

The New Orleans' locale is magnificently used, with detours to Cajun cookouts, strolls through Louisiana graveyards and conversations on French Quarter balconies adding memorable spice to the dramatic gumbo. The trio of stars, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Strother Martin, a bit past their prime, but as comfortable as a worn leather jacket, are perfectly suited as men scarred by the hard knocks of life.

Bronson especially, is given one of the finest roles of his twilight career. He's a man of few words, riding the rails looking to make a buck in bare knuckle fighting. We never really know his past, with his screen persona filling in the gaps. That's a fault. And yet like a ghost, he silently moves in and out of the shadows of New Orleans creating a fiercely independent character we would want on our side. Coburn, as usual, is terrific as the conman who bankrolls Bronson. He's a fast talker, eventually too fast for his own good. Martin, one of the finest character actors in history, is nothing short of brilliant as the cut man struggling with the dark addictions of life. These three characters are going nowhere, but for a brief moment as a team, they buck a corrupt and brutal system.

The fight scenes themselves are nicely choreographed, but what one remembers from ""Hard Times"" are the quieter moments - Bronson having a cup of coffee in a diner with Jill Ireland, Coburn smoking a cigarette in bed with a prostitute, Martin sitting in a church listening to gospel singers. These characters are weary and tired, and the Depression has left them hopeless and forgotten.

There is really no surprise as to this film's ending. Yet in many ways it is poetically perfect as Bronson, having saved the day, disappears back into the shadows never to return. This is a street legend as old as the hills. We watch the recent film ""Sea Biscuit"" and roll our eyes at its excess. We watch ""Hard Times"" and understand this tale at heart, is a simple yet inspirational one. Rarely has the legend been more perfectly executed on film.",1104105600,16,2445,4.759433962264151
24688,5,0767824555,"A real gem ! Contrary to another review (14JAN04)- 'Hard Times' stands-out as Bronson's finest action film. A former boxer (amateur)himself; Bronson is in top form (and top shape at 52 years old !). Patrick Swayze's attempt ('Roadhouse'), to emulate Bronson never worked - simply because Mr. Bronson was an original. See this film !!!",1084233600,4,334,5.090909090909091
24689,5,0767824555,"This film is, in my opinion, one of the best Bronson films along with Honor Among Thieves, Rider on the Rain, Red Sun, and From Noon Till Three. This role is tailor made for Bronson's tough, silent persona(like Chato's Land). This film was released in 1975 but was filmed in 1974-most films, after they finish filming, go into post production, editing and then are released up to a year after they actually finish shooting the final scene. Bronson was 52 yrs old(not 54) when he appeared in Hard Times. Bronson was born in Nov. 1921 and Hard Times was shot prior to his 53rd birthday in 1974.
If you watch the scene in the meat packing plant in Clint Eastwood's film Every Which Way But Loose, it seems like a direct rip-off of the Hard Times scene in Pettibon's joint--the manager of the defeated fighter won't pay up until a gun is produced. Also, in Eastwood's sequel Any Which Way You Can, Wilson, after scouting out Philo Beddoe's fighting ability, remarks ""It's been a pleasure watching you work"". This, to me, is a direct rip-off of Gandil's line to Chaney after the final fight in Hard Times. Interesting to note that Hard Times was released 3 yrs before Every Which Way... and 5 yrs before Any Which Way...
I happen to be a Bronson ""fan"" and own most of his starring role films as well as many of his supporting role films, but even if you are not all that interested in Bronson's work, you will still probably find this an excellent film in it's own right. The DVD is, in my opinion, crystal clear both in picture and sound, and gives you the added bonus of viewing in full or widescreen formats(the widescreen is 2.35:1 and is authentic widescreen). Towards the beginning of the film, there is a scene between Bronson and Coburn which takes place in an oyster bar. At one point, when Bronson is speaking, he is cut off from the scene in the fullscreen version but is completely visible in the widescreen version. Anyway, the DVD is well worth purchasing and I trust you will enjoy the film. All the best!",1083542400,5,2015,4.523287671232877

24701,4,0767824555,"No this is hardly a genuine classic film. The performances are decent, but nothing special.  Still, this is one of those films; you just want to see again. Charles Bronson plays a drifter, down on his luck with one marketable talent.  He's a great bare-knuckle fighter who needs to earn a few bucks to live on for a while.  Nothing is ever explained who he really is, or how he became such a good fighter.  His explanation to his new found promoter (played with some flair by James Coburn) is that fighting is something he's doing just for a while.
So why is this something you'd want to see again.  Actually, it's the fighting.  Rarely has anyone filmed a movie with more innovative fist fighting styles.  I'm guessing that a lot of the actual punches thrown, would not be practical in any real fight, still they look great on film. Each of the main fights has its own array of tactics that make in interesting.  The best of which, is the second before last fight, which boasts some interesting, overhead camera work.
I'm guessing this movie obtained in character, what Patrick Swayze, was trying to accomplish in Road House.  A woman he meets treats Bronson as a shiftless drifter.  After a brief attempt to get to know her, she dumps him when she finds a man with a steady job.  He then shows himself to have some real character, (at least to himself and the audience) by putting it all on the line. Instead of leaving town, he decides to help his new promoter, who's gotten in trouble with the load sharks. This gives the movie an ending, and even somewhat of a purpose outside of the great fistfights.
The DVD looks to be a little thin on extras', which is too bad; I'd love to know more about how they staged those fight scenes. A film this old that has not quite made the bargain bins in price, means the demand is still hot.  It usually means it's worth adding to your personal collection for repeat viewings.",1074384000,4,1917,4.477011494252873
24702,5,0767824555,"Many like to laugh at Charles Bronson(myself included) because of his typecasting in 80s vigilante style action flick where he's usually portrayed as a senior citizen taking out the scum of the earth.  You won't be laughing at him in Hard Times.  Bronson made good movies, played good roles(see The Great Escape for another good example).  Hard Times is one good movie.  Bronson is the textbook definition of ""tough guy"".  He plays a street fighter in the 30s who doesn't say much, but can knock the taste right out of your mouth.  Basically, it's the Bronson version of Every Which Way But Loose, minus the laughs and the ape.  Watch him beat the snot out of guys who think they're tougher than nails, and woo Jill Ireland in the process.  Watch James Coburn give another great performance(as usual).  Watch the movie, man!!  It's astounding that Bronson was 54 when he did this.  54!!!  He's solid muscle in this film, you'd have to be crazy to want to fight the guy!  Vin Diesel?  Russell Crowe?  Amateurs!  Tough guy wannabees!  You won't see them looking like this and kicking tail when they're 54, that's for sure.  It may be an all but forgotten film now, but thank god for dvd.  That means you'd better march your butt down to the video store.  Pronto.",1065571200,20,1260,4.615384615384615
24703,4,0767824555,"""Hard Times"" stars Charles Bronson as Chaney a down and out bare knuckle boxer trying to get by in the middle of the depression.  James Coburn as Speed is the quick talking not entirely trustworthy promoter who represents Chaney in fights through out the South and Midwest.  ""Hard Times"" is the directorial debut of Walter Hill who shows off a certain realism that would become his trademark in future works.  Still, it is Bronson who is the center of this film.  Perfectly cast as the aged fighter this is perhaps Bronson at his absolute best.  Bronson displays a subtle complexity that is particularly effective in the love affair with Lucy played by real life wife Jill Ireland.  Bronson, who was about 54 at the time of filming, is remarkably fit and completely believable even when the odds are stacked against him.  The story is taught and directed in a crisp fashion by Hill.  The cast is good as an ensemble lifting this underrated feature to the level of very good.  Yet, it is Bronson and that one of a kind face that makes ""Hard Times"" a true classic of the genre.",1064275200,5,1075,4.5863874345549736

24708,5,0767824555,"Tough guy Charles Bronson often copped plenty of criticism over his selection of roles and his alleged one dimensional character range. True, a lot of Charlie's choices were ""shoot em 'up"" avenger / crime films that ended up on video shelves fairly quickly, but Bronson was a key figure in the 1970's action genre and will be remembered for some stand out ""strong, silent type"" roles. ""Hard Times"" is generally regarded as Charles Bronson's best film role and is director Walter Hill's first feature film. Set in the Depression era in and around New Orleans, Bronson portrays the quiet , but toughened drifter Chaney, seeking to make ends meet through the prowess of his fists. After drifting into town aboard a freight train, Bronson hears a commotion emanating from a near by warehouse, Bronson then witnesses a bare knuckle bout and first meets James Coburn as the smooth talking, street wise, but addicted gambler, Speed. Bronson offers his services, to which Coburn replies ""You look a little past it..."", Charlie proves his worth with a one punch knockout of an opponent and the two partner up and set about winning a few dollars taking on local fighters and hoods. Coburn enlists the services of Strother Martin, who gives another wonderful character performance as the narcotic loving, disgraced medicine man Poe. The chemistry between the three is excellent, and remarkably Bronson's laid back persona is in stark contrast to the highly animated Coburn, but they work together like bread goes with butter !
And as was so often the case, Charlie found a suitable role in ""Hard Times"" for his then wife Jill Ireland, as his love interest, Lucy
Watching the film, it's hard to believe that Bronson was 54 years old when he commenced filming...Bronson's younger years saw his physique shown off in several movies, and he was still in good enough condition to still get his shirt off and flex his muscles for ""Hard Times"". I recollect reading two interesting descriptions about Bronson...one said ""he looks like a Clark Cable that has been left out in the sun too long"", and the other likened him to a bonsai tree ""gnarled, twisted and rooted to the one spot"" !!
Hill directs the movie with an economic style and effectively captures the hardship, struggle and cheapness of life in the Depression era...and an earthy jazz soundtrack compliments the lean feel of the film.
Plus, let's not forget the gritty fight scene choreography...and Chaney's formidable opponents. Notably the bald, grinning tattoed Jim Henry played by regular on screen bad guy, Robert Tessier...and real life stuntman cum actor Nick Dimitri as the malevolent, well dressed fighter, Street.
( Look out for : The scene early in the film at which time Coburn is sitting on his balcony reading the newspaper race guide, and you can clearly see his shirt cuffs, but as the door bell rings and Coburn leaps to his feet, he is suddenly only wearing a singlet, and then reaches for his shirt to put it on !! )
A very enjoyable movie and a worthy addition to your DVD library.",971740800,,3043,4.8538461538461535
24709,4,0767824555,"""Hard Times"" is a terrific looking movie that is also pretty terrific in a low key way. Certainly the best of Bronson's starring vehicles, Hard Times features some solid supporting work by old pros James  Coburn and Strother Martin.
The film is set (and was mainly shot) in New  Orleans and I can attest (being from New Orleans myself) that most of the  art direction is in fact no art direction at all but real places and  settings that need little or no art direction to give them authenticity.  (NOTE: I don't recall even seeing a credit for an ""art director""  in the opening credits).
This is not coincedental since the city itself  is a supporting character. This film has what many of today's film lack:  flavor. Flavor in the script, in the cast, in the locale (with non  stereotypical southerners), and in the atmosphere.
The DVD version is  beautifully preserved and crisp looking for a movie that's 25 years old.  Definitely worth collecting.",955584000,8,952,4.7439024390243905
