8404012,5,B003S65CII,"Honestly, I love (and my children love since very small) all these Bee Bright DVD's!!
My kids bilingual English-Spanish but we live in Spain, so what a better way to reinforce their English learning capabilities from here than with something they enjoy (TV) and something educational (Bee Bright)!!
Besides, I also recommended it as a perfect present for any new born baby, as the 4 DVD's set will adapt to the child's age and teach him/her while providing entertainment for years.
I just adore these DVD!!! :-) Thank you guys!!",1364256000,,528,4.877777777777778
8404013,5,B003S65CII,"Both my 2 year old and 3 year old love this DVD.  We had some minor issues with the conversion from UK to US, but we are able to play the DVD on our laptop so problem solved.  Cute, educational and very entertaining.",1348099200,,216,4.0
8404014,5,B003S65CII,This is a great learning DVD.  I am very picky about what my children see and I don't let them watch very many things.  But these First Steps DVD's their favorite.  Very educational (teaching a myriad of concepts in a clear and engaging manner) and a lot of fun.  My two adore watching Buzz and Fizz and Justin.  I am glad that I found out about bee bright (from their clips on youtube) and consider the money VERY well spent!,1327708800,,426,4.275
8404015,5,B003S65CII,"We don't have a whole lot of DVD's...but we do have lots of videos on youtube playlists that are toddler appropriate that my daughter likes to watch.  THAT is where we found Bee Bright.  At first the youtube clips were enough for her, but she just kept demanding to watch more of 'the bees', and I started surfing to find them.  I was a little hesitant to order and wondered if there would be any complications with the region coding on the DVD's (since I live in the US, and the DVD's are from the UK), but the Region 0 coding works great and we can view the DVD's in every machine in our house.  I know this because it has been played in EVERY machine on our house.  My daughter doesn't get a whole lot of screen time.  She's allowed one program (DVD, PBS, or youtube) in the morning after breakfast, and sometimes one program in the afternoon depending on the weather outside.  Right now the only thing she wants to watch in the mornings is ""the bees"" (or sometimes now she's starting ask for ""Justin"").  :)  The are very well produced and pleasant for adults to watch as well (can't say the same for a lot of other toddler programming).  And there are four separate programs on one DVD so it's money well spent.  The only thing that aggravates my daughter is when they do the alphabet and call ""Z"" the British name of ""Zed"".  She always points at it and adamantly says ""zee"", and looks at me like, ""why do those bees always get z wrong?!"".  LOL!",1308700800,,1449,4.322222222222222
8404016,5,B003S65CII,"I bought the whole box set of 4 Dvd's as I have 2 sons, one aged 3 and one 18 months old. Due to their ages we have currently only watched the first 3 DVD's and I can honestly say that they are riveted by each episode. My eldest son has Down's syndrome and mostly communicates with sign language but he absolutely amazed me on only his second viewing of Bee Bright by waving at the character Buzz and actually saying 'BUZZ'. His younger brother is also a big fan and the two of them wave hello and goodbye at Buzz and Fizz at every opportunity.

I have great hopes that the DVD's will help them both to learn colours, shapes and words in a very fun way. They both seem to love the music too and have a special little dance reserved for Bee Bright viewing. From my perspective it is cleverly and very professionally put together with the right amount of repetition needed for pre schoolers. I like its simplicity and the fact that I can turn off commentary and provide that myself and whilst initially I didn't really connect with the two characters Buzz and Fizz my two boys, who are definitely the right target audience, LOVE them!

Very pleased I found this set and was even more delighted when I showed it to our Speech and Language therapist who said that she had also read about it and that it was recommended to help children progress with their language development and understanding of concepts, eg big and small, shapes and colours.

I would recommend these DVDs to anyone!",1296777600,,1482,4.4411764705882355
8404017,5,B003S65CII,We have used these DVDs for my son since he was 6 months old and he has loved every one. He has picked up most of his knowledge of colours and shapes from these and his kindergarten has even remarked on how advanced his knowledge of shapes and colours is for his age! He can also repeat the whole alphabet as it is said and sung in these DVDs - and this has been since he was aged around 22 months. The logo on these DVDs says `Give Your Child A Flying Start!' and that is definitely what they have done for my son! The DVDs are entertaining and very well made and I would thoroughly recommend them to any parent. We have also tried the Baby Einstein DVDs but our son much prefers these - and so do we!,1287100800,,702,4.021428571428571
