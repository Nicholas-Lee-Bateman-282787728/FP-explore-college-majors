6701061,5,B00O1D38EW,"This is a great little indie Christmas film. It is largely different from any other classic Christmas film out there, complete with two great roles by musician veterans, Bertie Higgins (of ""Key Largo"" fame) as Uncle Bart (the pirate) and Darren Dowler (of Paul Revere & The Raiders fame) as Eric the Elf. All in all, a great family friendly Christmas movie. Buy with confidence! Did I mention there's a flying pirate ship?",1417392000,4,422,4.794520547945205
6701062,5,B00O1D38EW,Definitely a 5 star movie.  I took this movie to a theater at church where over 30 kids gathered to watch it.  The kids were from 9 years up to 18 years old.  It held their attention from start to finish. They laughed and commented how much they loved the movie after it was over.  Great story line. great cast and great all around production.  Could very well be a classic throughout the years.,1417219200,2,395,4.283783783783784
6701063,5,B00O1D38EW,"A light hearted enjoyable story of how a Chinese boy travels around the world in a magical flying  ship on Christmas Eve! He had to save Christmas by persuading three people to believe in Christmas again. Lots of fun, magic,comedy, a great cast and good music. Features international singing stars Bertie Higgins,John Ford Coley, Darren Dowler, and Jiang Zi Long Fun for all the family and kids of all ages. A timeless classic that will never date. Strongly recommended.",1417219200,3,470,4.949367088607595

8681392,5,B00O1D38EW,"Just saw ""Christmas In Hollywood"" last night and loved it. It's for all ages, wether you have kids or not, as I don't by choice. Adults could learn a lot from the boy Charlie, who taught the adults about the true meaning of Christmas. Of course, it was Uncle Bart (Bertie) who made a believer out of Charlie. So there was a litle bit of ""Miracle On 34'th St."" in the sense of a kid who did not believe being converted into a believer. There was a bit of ""A Christmas Carol"" with the corrupt banker, who was a Scrooge. There was a bit of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the happy ending. But it's really a unique and original Christmas movie which I recommend even for adults with no kids, like me. ""Thumbs Up"" from me, though I am no Roger Ebert. I think Roger would give it the same...Miss you, Roger.",1419379200,,797,4.215686274509804
8681393,5,B00O1D38EW,"A delightful indie Christmas movie. Bertie Higgins of Key Largo fame, and Darren Dowler, the multi-talented actor and lead singer of Paul Revere and the Raiders fame, bring magic, love, and a whole  lot of Christmas spirit into this enchanting movie of believing there truly is a Santa Claus to former non believers",1419033600,,315,4.943396226415095
