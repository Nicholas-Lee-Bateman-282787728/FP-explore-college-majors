4986112,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Purchased Love Never Dies on Blu-Ray today!  Couldn't wait to get home to watch it.  I saw the production in Melbourne the week before it was filmed and was awe-struck - it was amazing.  Now, having watched it on Blu-Ray it was great - not fantastic, but great.  The editing is a little too sharp in some places, but I think that was to keep the pace going.  Ben Lewis makes an excellent Phantom and Anna O'Byrne is a wonderful Christine.  The other actors are very good and the Gustave who is in this release was much better then the one I saw live.  I really enjoyed this movie and seeing it in 2:35:1 was a thrill.  Can't believe that it is not being released around the world to much later than it's release in Australia.  Fans of TPotO should really like this production, it has wonderful songs and melodies and really can stand by itself.  Well worth the purchase on Blu-Ray.",1328486400,2,881,4.382716049382716
4986113,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw this production in Melbourne in December. Not the best thing I've ever seen, but, certainly not the worst thing I've ever seen either ( That's reserved for The Little Mermaid and Spamalot ). The costumes and sets were amazing and there were some decent musical numbers, but my 2 complaints are 1) Although Love Never Dies is a good song, ALW totally ripped himself off by taking this exact song from his musical The Beautiful Game and changing the title and lyrics, which in turn, he took from a song that was sung at his 50th birthday concert that at the time he proclaimed was something he wrote for what he hoped would be a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. Come on, Man! You couldn't have come up with a new song? It might have made it back to where you had originally intended, but, you've already used it! And 2) This is a needless sequel that never should nor needed to be written! With that being said I will be adding this BluRay to my collection because it's a nice keepsake of my trip to AU and it wasn't terrible. It just won't get many repeat viewings. And this is one show we probably will never see here in the States.",1328313600,7,1141,4.287037037037037
4986114,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Outside of England, to my knowledge, Australia where I live, is the only other country to Have Love Never Dies currently showing, that finished in Melbourne Just before Christmas and is about to open In Sydney. I have seen the show twice now, The Phantom of the Opera I saw 5 times and it is my favourite Musical. In Love Never Dies the story continues with the Phantom Fleeing to Coney Island. 10 years has past and this is where the story takes up.

I do not want to give too much away, but Christine is lured to Coney Island with her drunken husband and 10 year old son, to sing for a large sum of money which she really needs after her husband Raul has become an alcoholic, and lost all their money and wealth over the years, so this is Christine's chance to get back to the life she once enjoyed all those years ago.

There is Drama, love and sadness as there was in the original Phantom of the opera and throughout Love Never Dies there are afew subtle references back to the original show through the music score, When Christine sings her signature song the scene too my breath away. If you loved Phantom of the Opera, you will love, Love never dies, Keep and open mind as the story unfolds as you follow this musical and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.

I too had read negative reviews when the show opened in London, perhaps us Aussies do not pay much attention to other's views and would rather see it for ourselves before passing Judgement, I have no regrets spending my money to see this show, it was fantastic. Enjoy the dvd, feel the beautiful music score and enjoy the show.",1328313600,347,1596,4.367003367003367
4986115,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I have just finished watching the actual Blu-ray, that will be released in the US as indicated above. It was released in Australia yesterday, so I can give a review of the real thing - not conjecture, which applies to most of the ""reviews"" so far. Before I say anything further, if you have not pre-ordered this yet, do so immediately.

I haven't seen the now-closed London production, so I am unable to give comparisons, except in relation to comments I have read. ALW had decided that the show would open London, Melbourne, Broadway. But the Australian director discussed the weaknesses of which ALW was already aware. So he gave total control over all revisions and the show has ended up brilliantly. Made for theater release, the Blu-ray is 2.35:1, not the figure given above. As I have a habit of writing l-o-n-g posts, I will keep this short. I saw the revised stage show here in Melbourne where the film was made, thought it to be among the best musicals I have seen. I think you will find many of the objections have been dealt with.

The show, in my mind, has emerged as being among ALWs best works, although it lacks the mass-appeal of ""Phantom"", to which this is not truly a sequel. The ability to see close-ups in the disk made the balanced flow of story and music more easily recognized. Universal have done a first-rate job in transferring the show to the screen. There have been no compromises, no cuts other than handling some sene transition in a manner better suited to the screen.

The first act (the Blu-ray has no such division) is really spectacular, and the story gets darker as it progresses. Acting, singing, sets, costumes, orchestra and conductor all play their roles in a way that could not be bettered.

So, to summarise: a great show, especially for ALW fans who enjoy his more serious work, beautiful video direction, image quality good without quite managing demonstration standards. Sound is exemplary, doing real justice to voices, diction and the orchestra. And at its low price (presumably because of the inferior initial version) and good Blu-ray technical standards, why are you waiting. Order it!

Added June 2015. Apparently there are now two productions playing in London; the original, and the Australian. The Australian version has been used in the vast majority of productions around the world.",1327795200,6,2338,4.820448877805486
4986116,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Yeah! The purist will say LND is actually an aggravation to Phantom. However, having seen the rewritten London production less than a year ago, I cannot help but think that the show DOES INDEED have the makings of a spectacular musical. Yes, the story is gooey and reminds one of the soft-focus plot twists of many soap operas but having said this, let me share my appreciation of the show. I went in knowing fully well that ALW had had the whole thing redone in London. I was aware of the lame reviews by critics (which, if you have been following the development of ALW's musicals, are ALWAYS there, from JSC to Evita, Cats, Sunset, Song and Dance, ... you name it, they all got AWFUL reviews but the public spoke and they all became hugh hits). Contrary to what had been the norm in previous ALW musicals (say The Beautiful Game, Whistle Down the Wind or The Woman in White) the score of LND is simply magnificent. Except for a recurring theme from Phantom, you cannot trace most of the melodies to previous ALW works. There are some impressive orchestrations, Sierra and Karim are just EXCEPTIONAL performers (and the fact that they stuck with it through thick and thin attests to their belief in the show) and the rest of the ensemble gave a very entertaining performance. The sets are just breathtaking as are the visual effects, the costumes and the choreography. So, what is it that made this show such a disappointment to many? Maybe it was the tinkering with the original Leroux story, maybe it was making both the characters of Phantom and Christine really human (yes, the ""did it"" like two teenagers on prom night and yes, there were consequences) or maybe it was just that everyone expected to see Phantom II when there were clear warnings in the program book that this was not a sequel to Phantom but a story that borrows some of the characters and reinvents them. My take on it was that I spent a delightful evening of musical theater, saw a top-quality show with amazing performances, beautiful music and an overall excellent production which were all worth the money I paid (which was a lot, actually). I am now looking forward to the DVD and I hope to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the show.",1327622400,9,2209,4.566750629722922

4986118,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I don't think that ALW intended for LND to be directly compared to Phantom. Phantom and LND are both different, but both VERY amazing/awesome/phantastic. even if the story is different from what some people think should happen, it's still a masterpiece and deserves to be recognized for its own music and story and actors, not for its prequel. the music is amazing. the cast is amazing in both productions. it's worth buying. keep an open mind and you'll be amazed.",1327363200,135,465,4.825

4986120,1,B006GHA9VQ,"--------------------------------------UPDATED REVIEW BASED ON DVD PRODUCTION AS SHOWN ON PBS------------------------------
As promised, I am now reviewing the actual production filmed.  What I find interesting is that it was on TV 2 and a half weeks after the video release!!  This confirms my initial thoughts that most people are rejecting it.  But I am reviewing it as a second look of the show and a first look of a new production.

As with most ALW shows, the production is more sumptuous than the score.  Beautiful sets and costumes and TV direction but at the heart is a bad libretto and score (as with most ALW shows, there are great songs but the overall score is mediocre.

Early on Meg and Madame Giry sing that the night that mob came for the Phantom, they found the Phantom and smuggled him to Calais then to the US.

Next when Christine first sees the Phantom. the sing Beneath the Moonless Sky and sing about the night that they met.  Now, some think that it is a time after the initial show but I feel it refers to the time that they went to his lair in the original show (moonless sky -- sewers of Paris) makes sense.

Taking this into consideration with the song about his escape, then the only time for the ""conception"" would be that one night where she went to his lair.  And most people agree that nothing happened there!

So as I originally stated, having the boy Gustav (great French name?) being the Phntom is still a stretch beyond reason.  And this is why I stand by my one star review.

Another issue is Raoul.  Phantom begins with the auction where an old infirmed Raoul buys the music box.  It is obvious that he well off with a man servant.  But at the beginning of LND, it is stated that that Raoul has gambled away his fortune.  And later on, it is stated that he is a drunk.  Another rewrite of the original.

If ALW was not involved in the show, then I would be more forgiving but he stated in the program that he was incharge of every aspect of the show especially the book of the show.

As I have over and over stated that the issue is not the staging but the story.  The best example I have of the staging being the issue is the show that premired at the same time as Phantom, Into the Woods.

I saw the first national company of the show.  At intermission everyone was saying it was the best show they ever saw.  At the end of the show, we were all dazed on how the second act totally sunk the show.  It was so dark (in tone and texture)that it totally ruined the show. Six months later, I was in London and saw their production.  They took out the darkness and made it more of a farce.  This worked well and kept the tone very even throughout the show.  It now worked but was a bit hollow.  A few years later, I saw a production by Glen Casale in Long Beach and he combined the best of both verions and added a few improvements of his own and turned the show into the great show it is.

What I am trying to say is that the problem with ITW was the direction not the book or score.  The problem with LND is the book and score and while a great director can camaflage the flaws, they cannot remove them, especially when they are as glaring as those in this show.

---------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW based on London Production------------------------------------
I saw the show in London just before it closed.  And I can say that the subtitle should be ""but thank God the show did!""

Be warned that to tell you why this show is so bad, I will have to reveal some plot secrets.

The Phantom has escaped Paris and is now in turn of the century Coney Island where he can blend with the other side show freaks.  He has built a vaudville palace and has lured Christine Daae to perform there.  Christine married Raoul who has become a drunk.  They have a son.  Madame Giry and her daughter Meg have followed.

Meg has become the Phantom's ingenue but he still desires Christine.  When Christine is lured to Coney Island, Meg realizes that her chance at being the main attraction is slipping away.  This sets up a series of events that will end in tragedy.

Now for the spoiler, which I guessed about 20 minutes into the show. Chistine's son is not Raoul's but the Phantom's!  Now could someone tell me where in PotO did Christine and the Phantom ever make love or just have sex.  This is just ridiculous.

What's even more disappointing than the banal book is the contrived score.  Even at ALW's worst his shows usually have at least one or two show stoppers.  This score is more of a show snorer!

If you are a Phantom lover, protect your memory of that show and pass this one up. Or wait until it is shown on your local PBS station (probably in the next year) as Cats, Joseph and JC videos were.

'Love Never Dies'lives

Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, rejiggered after chilly run in London, heads to cinemas
By David Ng

Let the Andrew Lloyd Webber offensive begin.

The famed British composer a Phantom of the Opera seems to be everywhere this season with the revivals of Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita opening soon on Broadway and Phantom sequel 'Love Never Dies' hitting cinemas around the world next week.

It's hard to believe that the celebrated composer - who has multiple Tony awards - was nearly down for the count last year when the critics and audiences delivered a knockout punch to his Love Never Dies during its London run. The highly anticipated sequel received mixed to negative reviews and closed earlier than expected in August.

Lloyd Weber said in a recent phone interview from New York that the London staging ""didn't work"" and the recent Australian version that opened in Melbourne ""worked triumphantly,"" though he acknowledges that ""my involvement in Australia was that of an observer.""

""There's not a lot in terms of rewriting - no new music was written for Australia, but one or two things have been rethought,"" Lloyd Webber said. ""Very small things can make a difference. One of the things I've learned in my career is that the fine line between something being huge or not is very small.""

The Austrailian production will hit cinemas in the US starting Tuesday. It will be the first time that the US audiences will have a chance to see the musical Lloyd Webber said he isn't concerned that this screenings could you rode the chances of a Broadway transfer.
The musical will screen in about 600 venues in North America and more in Latin America, according to Omniverse Vision, the distributor.
Lloyd Webber was in New York to drum up interest or support for love never dies he said a Broadway transfer of the SDRAM production would be expensive but he remains optimistic.",1326412800,46,6723,4.522783761391881

It follows the tale of the Phanthom and Christine approximately 10 years after the Phantom of the Opera finished. Christine and Raoul are not as happy as they once were, the Phantom misses Christine terribly and he has established a new base on Coney Island. Christine makes a comeback by singing in a show on Coney Island, not knowing that the Phantom has lured her here. Christine must make the decision that will decide the future for her and her ten year old son.",1523059200,,592,4.440366972477064
4986137,1,B006GHA9VQ,"They drop you right in where all the phans want to be, with the tormented and forlorn Phantom composing at his Organ. Watch him silently write for an uncomfortably long time before anything happens, his Inevitable lament of the long gone Christine. As I watched I thought... 'Why not make. People wait for the big payoff? Why not throw them into an unfamiliar setting and add a little mystery...'
Enter Coney Island!
Holy crap, what's happening here? This is an interesting immitation of a Tim Burton art direction, not a little reminiscent of the circus in Batman Returns. But it just never really fits. You're telling me the Phantom, the angel of music, is going to scribble light-hearted music for vaudeville? Make up your mind! Is Coney Island sinister and terrifying, or a sunny beach rhomp?
The child, upset that daddy won't play inspires Christine to sing to him, Love is a curious thing. A song that gaslights the boy and the audience into accepting abusive relationships as complicated expressions of love we are luck enough to receive.
What Weber cannot do through invention or skill he will achieve with mindnumbing repetition, redundance, and reiteration of his unimaginative themes and libretto. Did we seriously need an overature?
There's more. But you could guess it all. Better to go to an online message board yourself and write your own version of what should happen next in this Hannibal Lecter version of a romance.",1521849600,,1435,4.933884297520661

I think I""ve seen every show that he has done, even the one that was even done on Roller Skates - ""The Little Train that thought  he Could"". Can't tell you how many times I've seen Cats and Phantom (every time that they come to San Antonio) and Evita (also loved the Movie with Madonna and Antonio Banderas.  Also loved the Movie of Phantom.

I can hardly wait to see the Live Stage production.  The music is incredible (as usual) and the cast was fabulous.  What marvelous voices.  They give me ""goosebumps""!!!!!

I also loved the storyline.  I always wanted Christine to end up with the Phantom, but never thought that would happen.  I""m so please that

I did not see anything even close in Love Never Dies.. and the voices were well trained,  but,  the material they were singing was not even close to the original.  In most musicals there is a lot of plot transitional singing...  think of Oklahoma..  followed by the One song that is unforgettable and becomes a trade mark of sorts...  There was just nothing unforgettable in Love Never Dies..  I would guess that they were shooting for just that in the death scene when they keep repeating the "" Love Never Dies"" line...

4986190,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I thought no one would ever approach Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom in the Royal Albert Hall 25th anniversary show. Ben Lewis did. He is equally worthy and equally heartbreaking. He conveys grief exquisitely. And from before the story's beginning to its end, there is plenty of grief to be had. The pain of loss, the pain of star-crossed circumstance, the best paternity challenge in the world, more grief, pain, tragedy and loss.

Anna O'Byrne and her voice are as lovely as Sierra Boggess. They both far surpass Sarah Brightman, who in a brief clip of ""Music of the Night"" stared wide-eyed straight ahead, like a cross between Twiggy in 1967 and a deer frozen in headlights.
Those who say ""Raoul is a jerk"" will be satisfied, as he outdoes himself.
Lest anyone jump to the conclusion that Madame Giry is a bad guy, she worked longer and harder, and sacrificed more of her life than anyone making that assumption, then was shoved aside by an accident of birth.

One of my favorite aspects is the changed bearing and personality of a powerful, successful Phantom. (Whose disfigurement still deeply affects him and his relationships.) Ben Lewis described how he tried to convey that, how the circumstances would have to change someone.

If people are objecting because it isn't the ""real"" Phantom story, well, why cling to the ""original"" with a jealous, possessive fury? The same genius composer wrote both musicals. Neither one is Gaston Leroux's novel. They are both Webber musicals! Both are superb.

Why should I bother to give it only 4 stars? I'm giving it 5 stars. Every musical has songs which are a tad too fluffy or grandiose or corny for my taste. ""Look With Your Heart"" and even ""Love Never Dies"" don't move me nearly as much as some of the other pieces, just as ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina"", or even the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" were never my favorite pieces within a cantata or opera. All these works have songs more lyrical and beautiful than the ""famous"" piece.

I like ""An open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre"" by Barbara Ellen in The Guardian. She sarcastically writes: ""With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough."" And "" I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure I speak for many when I say I left your theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt.""

So yes, paint does dry. Beautifully. It is an excellent story in its own right, with soaring music by the same master heartbreaker himself. I like it better than my other favorite Phantom story at the Royal Albert Hall.",1498262400,,2676,4.744086021505376

4986195,4,B006GHA9VQ,"Sequels by nature are unnecessary yet most people wish to know ""what happened next?""  If you are satisfied with POTO's conclusion then this may not be for you. I'm a huge ALW fan as well as a phan of all things Phantom so I couldn't resist this one. The music is fantastic (would you expect less) as well as the performers. The sets are nice and set a back drop needed for the story, which is a dark, somewhat disturbing tale  of characters that have evolved (or devolved in some cases). Be warned that some familiar characters have undergone much in the 10 years since the events of the original.  Expect no comic relief, and be prepared for some rather jolting plot twists that may alter your feelings for the characters involved. I can see why critics as well as fans are divided on this. Some of what happens is difficult to watch, so be prepared. What I did enjoy most was the music, performances, as especially the setting. The Coney Island side show adds a dark element that I found intriguing if not eerie. I do, however, feel some of the songs are extended a bit long.  This does somewhat bog down the story in the first half, but things amp up in the final part. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original but would blame no one who doesn't care for the direction taken in the overall story.  Don't expect it to rival the original.  That wasn't ever going to happen.  It will come down to your personal taste as to how you ultimately feel after you have experienced ""Love Never Dies"".",1496534400,14,1509,4.425992779783393

4986199,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Melodies so beautifully lush and bittersweet, many of them tear-inducing, permeate the continuing story of ""The Phantom of the Opera""!!! I found the story quite wonderful, but, to be sure, there will be those who have issues with it. In a nutshell, Madame Giry and Meg helped the Phantom escape the burning of the opera house in Paris. Ten years later, they have all found a new home in ""the eighth wonder of the world"", Coney Island. There, amidst the freak shows and carnival atmosphere, the Phantom reigns supreme, but without Christine his life has no meaning. The show opens with the Phantom singing the gut-wrenching, "" 'Til I Hear You Sing"", which tells how empty his life is without her. We are then introduced to a myriad of characters with the haunting ""Coney Island Waltz"". Shortly, it is revealed that the impresario, Oscar Hammerstein I, has hired Christine to open his new opera house. When she, her husband, Raoul, and their son, Gustave, dock in New York City, the Phantom's minions mislead her to Coney Island where she thinks she is awaiting Hammerstein. Soon, she discovers otherwise, and that the Phantom has ""lured"" her to him with a deal that will end his misery and let him ""Hear You Sing Once More"". More stunning music follows: ""Look With Your Heart"", ""Beneath A Moonless Sky"", ""Once Upon Another Time"", ""The Beauty Underneath"" and, of course, the title song, ""Love Never Dies"". The rest of the story, in order not to spoil it, is one you MUST see for yourself!!! Even if you don't like the turns the story takes, reveling in the exquisite music and the sumptuous staging can be most worthwhile. For me, it just doesn't get much better!!!!!",1494374400,2,1665,4.744827586206896

This sequel is too detached from the original story and left me confused. The music is good but not at the level of the first film.
 From the first film Christine die at age about 63 in the love never dies she die after about 10 year after the fire  of the Opera House and disappearance of the Phantom. In fact she dies about 10 years later when she travel to Coney Island where she see the Phantom again.
This is confusing. I would hope they will make a movie and  call again as director Joel Schumacher and Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler Patrick Wilson as cast! That would make much more and give to the film a Logic sequel. Mr Webber and Schumacher are genius in their own right and they will make a great new movie!",1491177600,,875,4.165680473372781

So, I was excited when I was finally able to get this DVD of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""follow-up/sequel"" to his first masterpiece.  I didn't think Andrew Lloyd Weber could create anything disappointing, boy was I wrong!  In all fairness, I'll provide SOME positives:  the DVD functioned properly, and the stage production quality was very well done!  The video is of a filming of a live production of Love Never Dies filmed in Sydney, Australia.  The costume design is impressive, the sets are VERY well constructed, but the subject matter, lyrics, and overall plot were HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING.  The Phantom is supposed to be this grand character of an architect, a scholar, a magician, and a ""pure genius"", so why is it when he is singing to the woman he has loved FOREVER that the best lyrical combination he can direct towards her is that she is made of ""finer stuff"".  And *MILD SPOILER* I felt uncomfortable watching a musical number about a one-night stand AND another song with a fully grown man singing to a little boy about seeing the ""beauty underneath"".  But maybe that's just me.  Overall, I would NOT watch this again, I'm disappointed I paid over $10 for it, but at least I didn't pay for a ticket to the actual show.

The ending was horrible, and not just because I wanted a different outcome, but just because it left me shaking my head and wondering w.t.f. Also, the music is nothing to get excited about.

Pieces such as 'Till I hear you sing' 'Beneth a moonless sky' and 'love never dies' still have a phantomy feel to them and the piece 'Devil take the hindmost' is corny but I found it enjoyable.

4986252,3,B006GHA9VQ,"Although delivering amazingingly creative, inventive staging/sets, the premise of this follow-on to Phantom of the Opera, while certainly can be cited for original thinking, is often based on turning the beloved characters that you knew from Phantom on their heads in what feels like very unlikely character development, to the extent that I kept shaking my head throughout the piece. Although the music is mostly pleasing, I only walked away with the melody of ""Love Never Dies"" in my mind, whereas with Phantom, so many of the melodies haunted me. There are also moments where I felt like a cheap trick was used, unworthy of Lloyd Webber. When desiring to intensify the viewer's emotional response in the moment, brief interludes of music from Phantom were brought in to tug at your memories from the original.

4986258,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I've seen both productions and Love Never Dies is a nearly perfect sequel.  The music is very memorable especially the opening song, Til I hear you sing once more.  The set designs are spectacularly colorful and the chorus music lively and very reminiscent of the circus atmosphere of Coney Island.

The story line is progressive as The Phantom isn't the same as he was in the original.  Are any of us the same after we have fallen in love???  He grows emotionally, yet still, in Love Never Dies, he resorts to old habits to trick and threaten Christine to get what he wants.  Only to be brought to his knees by a small boy.  Similarily with Raoul; originally meant to be the good guy and he still is, but is beseeched with plausible downfalls of a formerly rich, entitled man, not really wise to the real world.

Now to the not so good parts.... even in the opening song, Til I hear you sing once more, there are a couple of lines that just don't fit with the language of the time of 1905.  I even came up with better fitting replacements.  The same, later on when the Phantom is signing to Christine, to sing ""you are made of better stuff""!!  "" Leave him in the dust"" !! Are kidding me???  Those lyrics absolutely need to be revised prior to the American tour next year!
Lastly, I'm still confused about when Christine and the Phantom were to have their tryst??  After she left the lair with Raoul??  That doesn't seem plausible with the ending of the POTO.  Christine sings in the sequel that she was led to believe he was dead...that would have been after she and Raoul left the Phantom's lair; which caught fire.  Why would she go back looking for him if she thought he was dead??  I'm confused about that part.
But other than those couple of lyrics and the sequencing of the copulation, I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel!!  I streamed it from Amazon a couple of times, now I need to get the DVD to add to my collection.  I just hope ALW can get Ramin Karimloo back for the touring version of this sequel as that would be the icing on top of the cake!!",1464825600,8,2056,4.363157894736842

4986277,1,B006GHA9VQ,"If you're a Phantom of the Opera fan, do not watch this movie! I love POTO, the book, and every single stage and screen adaptation, everything and anything Phantom. But my favorite is the Andrew Lloyd Webber version, he really captured the love and longing and loneliness of both the Phantom and Christine Daae, but added a twist and made the Phantom somewhat seductive and sexy. That way Christine had more of a dilemma and Erik was her confidant instead of just a creepy kidnapper.

It was truly magical and I loved the changes he'd made from the book. But the follow-up did not work by any stretch of the imagination. I'm not going to spoil it, but really, it spoils itself. The plot was just awful, the music was a pale imitation of his original POTO score, and it ruined the romantic/scary/thrilling/longing feel that he'd created before.

The actors were great, especially given what they had to work with. But the characters were such a departure from who they were when we'd last seen them that it felt disjointed and off-kilter. No one was remotely the same except partially the Phantom, but even he wasn't quite right, mostly because his music sucks now. Maybe it was supposed to be that way because he'd lost his muse, but I don't think so. It felt like ALW had rushed this just to put it out, it didn't have the same continuity that the original did, at all. Out of all of his musicals, this was easily at the bottom.

If he had kept some essence of the characters we fell in love with, it would have saved this, somewhat. Instead Christine had changed drastically and become a shallow snob, Raul was absolutely horrible, horrid, mean and an awful husband and father. The Phantom was a totally different Phantom than the one we'd come to know and love. In the original he sacrificed what he wanted more than anything because Christine's happiness meant more to him than his own. Now we have him meddling in her life and doing things that hurt her, just for his own gain. Maybe ALW was trying to say that people do grow and change over time, but that didn't come through. Instead it was like watching an entirely new, unknown cast muddle through a half-baked plot.

I wouldn't mind this so much if it had been created by anyone other than ALW, because then it would be a kind of fan fiction and wouldn't stick in my mind the way it has. Instead it felt like this is 100% what happened to my beloved characters because ALW said so. And now when I watch POTO I'm reminded of what happens to them in the future and who they ultimately become, which has kind of tainted the feel of it for me.

Yes, I'm being a bit dramatic, but I really hate this movie. When you have such a huge fan base you can't just go around wrecking the characters we've come to love and adore. And that's what this movie did for me. I wish I'd never seen it, so here's my warning to POTO fans - skip it! You're better off having never seen it.",1456876800,12,2925,4.409259259259259

There were moments of brilliance this film like ""Beauty Underneath"" and the opening/final aria.  I am disappointed in the portrayal of Raul because it didn't give Christine the true opportunity of choosing the Phantom to give her love to.  By discounting Raul and making his character into a drunk loser, the choice to leave Raul was easy.  Christine and Phantom's love should have been strong enough for her to leave Raul without turning his character into a flake.
I loved the surprise of the child.  I know there were complaints that you ""can't just rewrite the original,"" but if you really listen to ""the music of the night"" and don't watch that part, it could be interpreted as a consummation.

4986289,3,B006GHA9VQ,"Longtime Phantom fan here. I've seen/heard/read nearly every iteration of this story, and tend to enjoy most of them, although some are obviously better than others. I'm a huge fan of Webber's original Phantom musical, and admittedly did not have high hopes for this one going in, but I tried to keep an open mind.

I watched the DVD of ""Love Never Dies"" last night. I have some very definite opinions about it. The short version (if you don't care to read to the end) is that I'd gladly watch it again - at a bad movie night.

Musically, it was sadly, surprisingly lacking. Webber used to be one of the consummate composers of musicals, with a 'never miss' record. I haven't seen everything he's done, by any stretch, but Aspects of Love and Starlight Express come easily to mind as 'swing and a miss' shows that don't have the punch, glamour or musical grab of his earlier shows. I actually hoped that this one, based as it was on something so iconic as his Phantom, would be a return to his glory days - more a 'Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell' (if you'll pardon the 'Cats' analogy). This was more 'Asparagus'.

The performers were all adequate. I can't fault anyone's delivery of the songs they were given - you can only do so much with mediocre material. The best moments musically came primarily when echoes of the first 'Phantom' score snuck in - those actually caused me to sit up and pay attention. The only other exceptions were 'The Beauty Underneath', featuring the unexpectedly modern sound of electric guitars, and the bitter ""Devil Take the Hindmost"", which were actually fun. There was nothing really *wrong* with the rest of the score - it was just ... average. Nearly dull.

The story, however, was what made me stick with it. It was challenging at first: there is no 'ta-da' moment to start the show, and one was sorely needed. Once you get past the initial dreary opening (why would you begin a musical with a scene like that?) and the nearly-as-slow 5 minutes that follow, things do pick up rather quickly. I've heard the story of this show described as 'a reimagining rather than a sequel', and also as particularly trite fan-fiction set to music. The first is not actually true - the story obviously takes place 10 years after the original events at the Opera Populaire. In fact, the '10 years later' aspect is critical to the plot. (Can't say why - spoilers!) The fan-fiction part - well, I can't disagree there. Without going into spoiler territory, I can say only that this plot provides everything that one group of fans of the original rabidly wished for. And yes, I am one of those fans - so I was fully onboard with the story, all the way through to the rather surprising resolution. (Not surprising as in 'unexpected', but rather surprising in that Webber let the story play out that way.)

Many of the characters act in ways that are frustrating and annoying, but ultimately true-to-character - if those characters lacked the ability to grow and learn. They seem to be completely stuck in the patterns they learned in the first Phantom, and unable to deviate one iota from those predetermined traits. I found myself yelling at the screen, exhorting them to stop being so stupid and predictable, but alas, they could not hear me. They did, at least, remain true to themselves enough to follow their predestined paths all the way to the end, so there was some small satisfaction in that - although it's hard to ignore that every single bad judgment call any of them made was SO huge and obvious that anyone watching would have known to avoid it and make a better choice. The moral of this story, if I had to distill it down to one thing, might be two-fold: 1) Be careful what you wish for, and 2) Learn from your past mistakes.

TL/DR summary: Music mostly disappointing; singing fine; characters locked into roles from which they cannot deviate; fairly satisfying story. Overall, it would make GREAT fodder for a bad movie night, if you enjoy cheering/jeering characters who make obvious judgment errors on a regular basis.",1452124800,,4061,4.664804469273743

I am not a huge musical person but there are some shows that have blown me away and make me appreciate this kind of art.  The Phantom of the Opera was one of those shows.  The sets, costumes, story, music, and lyrics are simply incredible.  Love Never Dies (LND) has none of these.  The actors were talented there is no question of that and i know that this is a completely different entity than Phantom.  But it is horrible.  The story, music, songs just failed.  There is a reason this show only lasted in London a year= Its bad.  I don't care what the critics thought(they also hated it too but they hated Le Miserables aswell when it opened) but the people hate it too!

It's done in the traditional style as the original musical, and the scene cuts are set as the 25th anniversary of phantom are.

4986296,2,B006GHA9VQ,"Okay; if you watched ""Phantom of the Opera"" from 2004, and got all hepped up over the new, sexy phantom, and secretly yearned that Christine had chosen him, THEN, you will love this movie. What's not to love about a guy who's watched, and obessed over you from childhood? A guy who manipulates, controls, kidnaps, murders, blackmails, and terrorizes for you? Right from the start, poor Raul was thrown under the bus, or in this case, the coach-and-four. Raul is every woman's fantasy; wealthy, attractive, loves unconditionally, to the point of willing to marry a commoner. But that was in the last movie. Here, he's gambled away his fortune and faces his responsibilities by turning to drink. But he's got an ace, his wife's talent, that he'll use to pay off the debtors. AND, their son sings a sad song about his father's neglect. What a cad. Enter...the phantom, who has tricked the family into coming to Coney Island. Wha-ha-ha. Christine reacts in fear, avoids him, but they start singing a song about one starry night that went over my head. When Gustave meets the phantom, Christine finds them together, and in a few short lines I learned that Gustave is...that Christine and the phantom...I didn't know whether to scream or puke. Hopefully he saved the burlap bag from his childhood for her to use. I kept watching, but with hope, that the story would turn around...it didn't, it got worse. Raul didn't even react with righteous anger when the phantom threw the truth in his face about Gustave. Christine is alone this time when it comes to a heavy decision. Raul makes a foolish gamble about who she'll choose, then takes off to the boat dock. And, yes, I was surprised when the lights came up, and she was standing on the stage to sing the signature song. In this story, phantom was her secret love. I couldn't wring out a single ounce of romance for that mis-matched couple. Instead of a sigh, a groan of disapointment. Webber has a sick sense of the romantic. Meg, having flipped out at being replaced to sing the title song, kills Christine, putting her out of her misery. She was unhappy anyway, with her life. After dying in phantom's arms, he grudgingly allows Raul to hold her, while Gustave, having recovered from the trauma of seeing phantom's face, lets him know that all is well, and he'd love to be groomed as phantom junior. The story's description says it takes place ""ten years later."" But I'm at a loss as to which story Webber is referring to. The 2004 movie ended in 1919, flashed back to 1870, then forward to a fancy headstone, reading that Christine died in 1917. This story is set in 1905. In a couple places, they played a few notes here and there from the 2004 movie. If it were ten years later, it'd be 1880; a little confusing. In the original book, phantom died shortly after allowing Christine and Raul to leave. In the book and the 2004 version, Christine was emotionally torn, but only because of phantom's manipulations; it was clear that her heart belonged to Raul. The music for Love Never Dies was okay, but nothing memorable. I think they hoped the title song would be a hit, but it just struck a sour note with me. And I'll tell you something else I noticed right away that really bugged me; almost ALL the actors had a visible lump in the middle of the forehead, at the hairline. It looked like a large skin tag. The phantom's was down on his left cheek. Christine's hair covered hers until they pulled her hair back. I kept starring at it. The live audience sat too far back to see it, and its been erased from the faces on the front and back of the DVD cover, but I wondered about its purpose, and why they couldn't have been more professional. When Raul was whining about what to do, I spoke to the TV, ""you could get rid of that ugly skin tag, for starters."" It was very distracting. I kept thinking of the commercial for removing skin tags. This was 2 hrs and 1 min of wasted time. There was also no explanation as to how phantom recovered financially. In closing...they are all talented actors, but I didn't feel that bond, or that magic, between them like I did with the 2004 movie. And the makeup on Christine was so heavy, she looked plastic. Maybe that's why she didn't smile, cos she couldn't.",1448236800,,4251,4.550913838120104

4986315,3,B006GHA9VQ,"3 stars is a split rating. For technical aspects of the production itself, the professional video of the actual stage performance, set design, and all of that, this is all I'd expect out of Really Useful and ALW. 5 stars for the production. For the actual story, however, I'd only land at about 2 stars, or 2.5.

The production featured on this disc is of the Australian cast and crew. The story has been revised from the original London launch, and the set design was delegated to local Australian designers. The team in Australia really delivers on the production. It is an amazing piece of work that flows well on stage. Lots of moving pieces. The same goes for the video team filming this in a live show. It really is a quality production brought to life on video for those whom can't go see it. As is the same with the original show's 25th anniversary film, you can see the mics pretty easily in some costumes, others not so much. But still fun to watch. I think the talent was great, but Ben Lewis (portrays the Phantom) has this constantly-intense look in his eyes that fits the character but sometimes just seems out of place. I don't discredit him any for it, it's just a bit odd. Even during soft, intimate scenes he looks like he's about to kill someone. Hmm.

That's about all I can say that is good without getting into details of the story. SPOILER ALERT. Don't read past this point if you don't want the story spoiled. My issues aren't with the production, but with the story itself. As a Phan, I wanted this sequel to Phantom to be great. I really did. With ALW and RU still in control, and supposedly working on it for YEARS, I thought it would be. After having seen it, I feel let down.

I can buy that the Phantom fled to Coney Island after the Opera House fire to live amongst the freaks. I can even buy that he found success managing a circus/freak show, after all he already ghost-managed an entire Opera for years. It's a stretch, but I can even buy that Madame & Meg Giry followed him to the U.S. for financially secure futures with someone they already knew (kind of - still takes a lot of guts for them to assume he wouldn't just kill them). But that's where this story starts to go horribly wrong.

Meg is the first of many character flaws I see. In the original, she is a sweet, innocent young lady whose focus is on dance. She sings some, as a chorus girl, but her focus is through her mother's experience: dance. When we arrive on Coney Island though, Meg has grown up and is all about singing and being the show's feature attraction. She is somewhat inspired but also somewhat jealous of her old friend Christine's lifelong success, and she rebels against her mother just a little too much for her own good. She also seems to have developed an unhealthy infatuation with the boss man (Phantom), and desperately seeks his approval even though he doesn't ever address them in person - and has no clue of her fancy. When she finds out Christine will be visiting New York with her now-famous family, she immediately starts speculating about her running into the Phantom there, and what may come of that. Of course we-all-know-who overhears about Christine's visit and he sets himself up for more trouble.

Christine is the only character I buy that hasn't dramatically changed or turned around 180 degrees throughout this story. She is her sweet and quiet self, now a world-famous singer/performer, a little older and more distinguished, and clearly enjoying the rich and lavish lifestyle with Raoul - through remaining very modest and humble. Raoul has gone off the deep end though, and seems to have a lot of celebrity mentality, chip on his shoulder, etc. It is speculated he gambled away his fortune and is a raging alcoholic now, and Christine is secretly unhappy. They have a son together that is just overly positive and intuitive about everything dark and morbid, and go figure - he's also musically gifted. Of course, his name is Gustav, after Christine's father.

Just twenty minutes into this story and it's pretty clear where it's headed.

Phantom sends his goons, posing as Hammerstein's people, to pick up the family from the docks and away we go. It isn't long before he distracts Raoul away from Christine and confronts her. She faints, awakens, is extremely pissed...they sing, passions re-ignite, and we're reminiscing. He claims he only wants her to sing something for her one time at his show and will pay her double what Hammerstein pays. She says no, and then they are interrupted by Gustav. Phantom likes the boy immediately and decides to blackmail her by threatening to make Gustav disappear. She hesitantly agrees to perform at his show. The piece he wants her to sing is original and believes it will convince her to come back to him and leave Raoul. What he doesn't realize is he's now double-booked Christine and Meg on the same night. Meg finds out and rightly explodes, knowing she can't come close to Christine.

Madame Giry gets pissed about the Phantom's ignorance of her own daughter and breaks the news to Raoul about whom runs the joint and wants Christine to perform. Tempers ensue, and they lose track of Gustav in the bowels of Coney Island. Of course we all know who has him. Phantom takes Gustav on a journey of the freaks, and eventually realizes the boy is musically gifted. This is where it is first speculated that he may be Phantom's child and not Raoul's. This is also the point that I really start to hate the story.

Phantom can't contain himself very long, and eventually confronts Christine about the child. She confirms that he is indeed his son. This is complete absurdity when compared to the original story. It was never suggested that Phantom and Christine made love in that way. And even if it was, there was only one time in the original story that it could have happened: ""The Music of the Night"". Unfortunately that was in the first act of POTO, where she fainted on Phantom's bed (which he was NOT anywhere near except to close the curtain for her), which took place roughly six months BEFORE the second act. The second act opens with Raoul and Christine getting engaged, and she is most agreeably NOT pregnant. Some may say it could have also happened during ""The Point of No Return"", but that took place as a play within the play during Don Juan.

At first I thought maybe she was just saying it was his son to appease things, hoping to get away fast - which would make more sense. But no, the further the story goes the more confirmation we get that he really is Phantom's son. So the whole thing just isn't making sense. Of course it all degrades and falls apart, with Raoul and Meg eventually plotting together to make something bad happen to Phantom because he somehow deserves it. Phantom confronts Raoul and tells him that they can either leave as a family without Christine performing and still get paid, or Christine performs and will leave Raoul with the money only. But by this point, Christine will have none of that and is set in her ways on performing.

Meg goes on before Christine and puts on a hell of a show, but of course Christine's piece blows everyone away. She of course decides to stay with Phantom, whom sends Raoul on his way with the money, sans wife and son. But before everyone can celebrate, Meg attempts to jump in the ocean, which finally gains the attention of Phantom she's been so desperately looking for. He tries to appease her, too little too late, and she pulls a gun threatening to shoot him. He tries to grab it from her, but in the process Meg pulls the trigger, missing Phantom and hitting Christine whom is standing in shock behind him. Phantom yells for someone to get help, Meg and Madame Giry run like criminals, and we all cry as Christine dies. Gustav returns with Raoul just in time to see her pass away in Phantom's arms, then there's an awkward silence and staring between the two men. Phantom almost jumps himself, but then the boy comforts him and convinces him to live on. The end.

I can almost agree with the timing of Christine's death based on the film version of POTO from 2004 and what her headstone says at the end of the movie. That's the only time any of this makes any sense at all, and that's not even featured in the stage production POTO. The rest of this story, I have to say, is complete disappointment. I am not discrediting anyone's work on it, sometimes sequels just don't work. And POTO is this case. It should be left as a stand-alone story. A prequel might be okay if done thoughtfully, but the sequel just doesn't click.",1442966400,,8587,4.572449642625081

Essentially the plot has the feel of a fan fiction and is one giant apologetic excuse of why the phantom should be with Christine. The plot is as predictable as it flimsy. I wish it wasn't..

Now if it was a different love triangle and showed the phantom had changed I'd give it three stars. If it was a prequel (with different supporting characters) that showed how he devolved into the monster he became I'd give it four. However in all accounts it is a disappointment that failed to deliver. However I'd still reccomend picking up the CD soundtrack if you are a huge phantom fan.

I mean, really, I can't see the Phantom happily running a theater in Coney Island. The scene in Gypsy where Mama Rose got so mad about them being asked to play in a Burlesque house came immediately to mind when I watched it. Vaudeville actors do not play Burlesque houses. The Phantom would not do a two bit side show in Coney Island.

One needs to set aside (or reserve for post-viewing discussion with friends and family) one's expectations as to what *should* happen in a sequel to the original ""Phantom"" and just go with the flow of the what the show's creators have done. All told (and forgiving a couple of numbers that don't really move the plot forward), the score is outstanding and memorable. Additionally, as befits a sequel to ""Phantom,"" the plot is appropriately both melodramatic and emotional. The lead performers received a well-deserved ovation from the theater audience at the end.  Because, unlike the theater audience, our vantage point as viewers of the video is often within the action, the emotional and musical stakes are heightened. The blu-ray image is eye-popping in its clarity, further contributing to the experience of immediacy.

4986421,1,B006GHA9VQ,"This was by far the worst of any sequel I had to sit through. In the original Phantom, despite being controlling and demented, in the end you are drawn into feeling real pity on this creature.  His motives, as twisted as they are, are drawn out of love for Christine.  Weber tries to recycle the same motive for this production, but it falls woefully short.

The story takes place 10 years after Christine encounters the Phantom.  Raul drinks too much and they are in debt.  Christine goes back into the limelight in an attempt to stabilize their lives.  They have a child, but Christine is uncertain it's Raul's because of the ""love affair"" she and the Phantom had 10 years earlier.  It's 1901 after all and DNA tests haven't been invented.  The Phantom is now wealthy and successful as a legitimate opera house owner.  He has changed for the better because of Christine.

How does he show his gratitude for her compassion?  He decides to manipulate her against her husband and seduce her into an adulterous affair, forcing her into a position to where she has to choose between him and her husband.  Worse, he does it pretty openly.  He takes Raul out for a drink to try to convince him that she's too good for him.  For such a virtuous woman, she sure gets drawn into an adulterous relationship pretty easily.

What this production does is basically destroy everything we came to love about the original.  It destroys Christine's young virtuous innocence because she's now a married woman with a son.  We could overlook her naivety before because of what she had been through growing up.  Now she comes across as unfaithful, insecure, undevoted, and just plain stupid.  Worse, she doesn't even know this guy's first name!  Raul, with as many faults as he has, is trying desperately to put their lives back together.

We had pity on the phantom in the original.  As sadistic as he was, we could overlook that and give him a second chance.  In this production, he is living his second chance.  So, he decides to manipulate the very woman who inspired him and destroy her family because he's sure he would be a better husband.  I thought after getting married, that issue isn't even up for debate.  Seriously, if you had doubts about the Phantom being a jerk in the original, those doubts are gone now.  This guy is a complete turd!",1421452800,13,2332,4.638141809290953

4986506,1,B006GHA9VQ,"When something is as great as Phantom of the Opera, it really just needs to be left alone.  We just saw the American touring company of the Broadway show and it was magnficent.  The costumes, the sets, the voices - it was perfection.  My daughter, who is a bit obsessed since we saw the show, wanted to rent this ""sequel"" and I agreed.  It says Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote it so it must be great, right?  Wrong.  Apparently Mr. Webber wrote the music but someone else wrote the book and the lyrics and it shows.  This production was filmed on stage in Australia.  I pity those who had to sit through it live.  The songs were just bad, not lyrical or hauntingly beautiful like those in Phantom of the Opera.  They lyrics work so hard at telling an alternate ending story that the musicality gets lost.  In this version, it is ten years past the ending of the original musical and the Phantom has moved to Coney Island and opened a sort of freak show.  Christine is a world famous opera singer, married to Raoul and mother to a young son.  Raoul has become a heavy drinker and gambler, losing all their fortune so Christine takes a job singing at an opera house in New York, thereby bringing her back into the path of the Phantom.  There's much more heavy drama and more to the back story but I won't spoil anything just in case you do try to watch it. The actors in this production are so overly dramatic as they sing that it's almost funny at time.  If you are a fan of the Phantom, I would advise you not to spoil the wonder that is Phantom of the Opera by watching this.  It's just dreadful.",1414972800,12,1591,4.2885906040268456

The trailer looked so good.
Anna as Christine in her beautiful white dress made it look so good.
But it was. Well. . . It was okay...
If you want it to be good I suggest you skip the first 30 minutes.
To where Meg and the Madame are talking.
Let me tell you. I wonder if Mr. Lloyd Webber ever read the original 'Phantom of the Opera.'
Raoul was a kind childhood friend who came to Christine's house as a child and listened to her Father play his violin.
He did not gamble and he was not an alcoholic.  I want to know who came up with this terrible idea.
The Phantom Eric, was a mastermind. He was a ruthless killer, He  tortured Raoul killed a  number of Opera employees kidnapped Christine and you have turned him into a family man.
He wouldn't have ran from Christine he would have taken her and kept her locked up because he had an obsessive love for her.
They made him Emo. All he did was cry or be angry.
Christine hated him in the book. She was afraid of him and he made her cry. He kept telling her he was going to burn down the opera house and kill everybody if she didn't marry him (If I remember correctly)
I highly doubt she would have willingly made love to him. In fact if she did, He probably raped her.
She loved Raoul.
Then I hated the Techno music. I hate it. I enjoy Classical music and Opera.
Then we had the Circus workers. Normally I like them. I like plays about performers but all they really did was show off that midget lady and her two creepy friends. I would have loved to see a few more of the dancing girls because they were beautiful.
I also hated how they represented Meg and the Madame.
Madame Giry, loved Christine She took her into the opera house after her father died.
She knew that Christine had nothing but she took her in. They made her greedy in this one.
She had a daughter and she would have probably understood the Phantom wanting to give everything to his son.
Meg, Meg was a nice girl. In the book after Carlotta left she jumped up and screamed the Christine would do the
part. She was not jealous. The phantom promised her mother she'd be an empress if she helped him.
In fact. Meg became the Baroness de Castelot-Barbezac. She in no way shape or form joined a circus
Why not do an interpretation of 'The Phantom of Manhattan'? It didn't have this circus nonsense and gave Raoul a good image just saying that he could not have a child. The boys name was Pierre and Christine still died at the end.
It started getting good in the middle. But The ending was terrible. Like Madam Giry would have let Meg be a prostitute. EVER.  Then it just ends abrubtly? It was okay. I guess. NOT NEVER AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! But it was okay.",1410048000,,2702,4.210424710424711

4986568,1,B006GHA9VQ,"*WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!!!!*
Having come across the filmed, Melbourne production on Amazon I was driven by curiosity to give it a try.  Being an avid POTO fan, I went into this viewing experience knowing full well that I would not receive the same chills that I feel everytime the music begins in the original musical.  I never expected the plot to rival the heart wrenching story set in the dungeons of a Parisian Opera House, nor did I expect the music to rival the beauty that is the original POTO.  Yet, even with my reality colored glasses, I was appalled by this musical.  From the convient (and at times corny) rhyming lyrics to the overuse of spoken dialogue, this musical was rubbish.

However, what was most beguiling and frustrating was the outright character assassination in this musical.  Don't get me wrong, I was rooting for Christine to end up with the phantom at the end of the original musical as much as the next person, but knowing that she chose a man who loved her enough to sacrifice his life rather than see her marry a man she did not want to, made her ending up with Raul okay.  Flash forward ten years, and now Raul is a drunken gambler who has pissed his fortune away, and shows nothing but coldness to his wife and son?  Ridiculous.  And Meg and Madame Giry somehow transformed to greedy desperate women who are manically obsessed with the phantom.  Because, it's convenient to the plot I suppose.  Finally, let's focus on the Phantom himself.  Gone is the recluse who hid away in artful solitude pining over his muse.  Instead, he has become a mogul who surrounds himself with his employees.  And the most irksome part is that he threatens to abduct Christine's son, should she choose not to perform for him.  Yes, we know that the phantom was perfectly content to toss a Punjab lasso around anybody who came between him and his muse; but it was his ultimate love for Christine that led him to set Raul free.  He realized even then that killing the man Christine loved would destroy her.  Yet somehow, after not seeing her for ten years, the first thing he does is threaten her child?  Utter garbage.  And finally, Christine herself.  Basically, it felt like her character was centered around the fact that ALW regrets not having the those two end up together in the original musical.  Her first song contains the lyrics ""love you don't understand, is love you later regret.""  And upon reconnecting with the Phantom, she professes the fact that after they slept together one night 10 years ago, she loved him and would have followed him anywhere.  It was the fact that he was gone when he woke up that caused her to shun him.  Okay, plot.  Whatever you say.  Oh, also Christine and the Phantom slept together ten years ago, and Christine's son just happens to be 10 years old...what a completely unique and in no way overdon plot twist.  Shame on you, Andret Lloyd Webber.",1408492800,7,2902,4.628180039138943

4986588,4,B006GHA9VQ,"When I first heard that ALW had written a sequel to Phantom of the Opera, I was skeptical, and when I heard what he had done with it I had no desire to see Love Never Dies at all. I thought, ""How dare he ruin the story?!"" But then, over time as I started listening to the songs and seeing more of it, I decided to give it a try. I was surprised indeed!

While LND isn't as good as PotO and I didn't care for some of the changes, I felt that the changes with some of the characters and the story were believable. Even though Raoul has sunk in the world, I still liked him better than the Phantom, who hadn't changed now bit and was just as bad as before. I felt a lot of sympathy for Raoul as a man who is struggling in the world, perhaps from his own doings, perhaps not, and he's dealing with it the best he can. True, he's not dealing with it well but I felt that Simon Gleeson did a good job at his role. Raoul did love Christine, and I still believe he loved her as much as the Phantom or perhaps more. He didn't leave Christine; he came back for her. The Phantom used Gustave as a piece in his game to get Christine to sing when she didn't want too. True love? I think not.

Speaking of Gustave, I was very impressed with Jack Lyall. Such a young and talented boy! And he could sing and act on stage for two hours! That's talent for you. I really liked his character. Anna O'Byrne was a great Christine; I wish she had been able to sing more big numbers besides ""Love Never Dies."" I must say that I didn't care for Ben Lewis as the Phantom. I mean, he was fine but compared to Ramin Karimloo he wasn't that impressive. He seemed rather stiff most of the time, and his voice wasn't as good as Ramin's. This doesn't mean he was terrible, but he's my least favorite Phantom so far. He did have an awesome coat, though! I loved it! I think it would have been more fitting for the Phantom to have died saving Christine than Christine dying, but that's just my opinion.

The music, sets, and costumes are enough to make me watch it again even if I had hated the story. The music didn't measure up to the PotO music, but it wasn't terrible. My favorite songs where ""Till I Hear You Sing,"" ""Beneath a Moonless Sky,"" and ""The Beauty Underneath."" The melodies are beautiful and haunting and I still hear them in my head.

The only things I didn't like about this is Raoul's change of character, and the fact that Christine spent a night with the Phantom while at the opera house. When did that happen?! The Christine in PotO would never gone back to the Phantom, and Raoul, who loved Christine enough to die for her, wouldn't have made a deal with the Phantom to just leave her if she sung. Of course, he did come back, and I still liked him, but I wished ALW would have left his character alone. The man who went after Christine would never have become the character portrayed here, if you want me to be blunt.

To me, while I enjoyed LND, it's not really a sequel. I mean, ALW really messed up on the two points that I've already mentioned. Also, if you really want to know what happens next just read the end of book; Christine and Raoul getting married, and the Phantom dies under the opera house.  Sorry, everyone. So while I did enjoy LND, it will never measure up to PotO. I look on it more as an alternate ending, a ""what if"" kind of story even though we know how the story really ends.",1406851200,,3389,4.1664122137404584

4986605,4,B006GHA9VQ,"""Love Never Dies"" is the authorized sequel to Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Phantom of the Opera."" (Note that it's a filmed theater production, not an actual movie.) You'll either love it or hate it. Or you'll have mixed feelings, like me! At times, it's eerily reminiscent of the original production---so much so, it will give you chills. At other times, it's like ""Phantom"" on acid. . . .

The story begins with the Phantom living in Coney Island, ten years after the events of the original musical. He owns an amusement park and is apparently quite wealthy. Still obsessed with Christine, he's desperate to hear her sing just once more. Therefore, he lures her and Raoul, and their ten-year-old son, Gustave, to America, with the promise of a very large sum of money if the ""world famous Christine Daae"" will sing at his amusement park. The plot kind of gets bewildering from there, but it involves side-show ""freaks,"" and automatons, and ""Ooh-lah-lah Girls."" Madame Giry and Meg play pivotal roles, as well, so it's like a family reunion of sorts.

I adored the original musical, so I was thrilled when they filmed a production of the sequel and released it on DVD. However, I didn't care for some of the casting choices. Meg was fine, Raoul seemed pretty good, and Christine was lovely, but the Phantom kind of creeped me out. He seemed too melodramatic, like a magician or a silent film star from the 1920s. In every production of ""Phantom"" that I've seen (and I've attended several, both in the US and the UK), I always fell in love with the Phantom, despite his flaws, despite his temper---he always had a compelling quality that made me look past his violent tendencies to the tortured soul hiding within. But in ""Love Never Dies,"" I found him too obsessive, too stalkerish, too creepy. I didn't empathize with him.

In fact, most of the characters were like caricatures of themselves. Instead of the loving, confident Raoul, we have a drunken gambler who is physically abusive of Christine and their son. Instead of the calm, protective, stoic Madame Giry, we have a jealous harpy. Instead of quiet, supportive Meg, we have an ambitious, jealous lunatic. At times, watching ""Love Never Dies"" seriously felt like reading a bad fan-fic!

But it does have some redeeming qualities.

For one thing, it has some really amazing costumes. It's supposedly set ten years after the original musical, in the early 1900s, but the problem is, ""Phantom"" wasn't set in the 1890s. The exact date is contradictory--Christine's father's tombstone suggests one year (I forget which), while the costumes mostly suggested the early 1870s, but a few were from the early 1880s, and some were from the late 1880s. According to the souvenir brochure, it's set in 1881, just like the original novel by Gaston Leroux. So placing the sequel ""ten years later"" in the early 1900s didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. But even so, the costumes are consistent (mostly) with the turn-of-the-century, and they are lavish and well-done. Really gorgeous!

The music is, for the most part, exquisite. Some pieces feel more vaudeville, while others are operatic, and some are more punk rock, but as a whole, it works. There are even hints of the original ""Phantom"" score in a few places, which was done for deliberate emotional impact. This DVD is worth it just for the Phantom's song, ""'Til I Hear You Sing Once More,"" which is incredibly powerful and poignant. The title song, ""Love Never Dies"" is quite good, too. Personally, I loved ""Under a Moonless Sky,"" as well, though some fans disagree. (If you love the music, you'll definitely want to get the soundtrack, which was recorded by Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, who played the Phantom and Christine in the 25th anniversary performance of ""Phantom."")

Overall, I enjoyed this sequel to ""Phantom,"" even if there were some moments that left me shaking my head with disbelief. I can't, in all fairness, give it five stars, because it does have some major issues with characterization and plot. But if you're a diehard fan, you'll want to give this a try. You might love it, or you might hate it, but it's worth watching at least once. I wavered between giving it three and four stars, but finally decided to err on the side of being nice and said four stars.

4986626,5,B006GHA9VQ,"""Love Never Dies"", with music by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber with Lyrics by Glenn Slater/Additional Lyrics by Charles Hart is beautiful. The original production which opened in London a few years back met with a cold response. Although I never saw it, I did end up eventually falling in love with the music and listen to the London Cast Recording often. Shortly after the show's premier, it was re-tweaked - certain plot elements removed, scenes shuffled around and although the principal songs were left intact, the changes made did impact the overall production. This new production was launched in Australia to some critical acclaim and this is the show Webber decided to immortalize here.

The plot is set 10 years after the events of the original story and centres around the 3 main characters:

The Phantom (Ben Lewis), now living in New York's Coney Island and owner of ""Phantasma"", a Coney Island amusement park.

Chrisine Daae (Anna O'Byrne), a famous French soprano. She is summoned by composer Oscar Hammerstein to sing for him in a New York opera house.

Raoul - Vicomte de Chagny, now married to Christine. They have a 10 year old son Gustave. Raoul is now an insecure, bitter alcoholic who is constantly clashing with his young wife.

Also returning from the original story are Meg Giry and Madame Giry. Meg who is no longer a ballerina, she performs in the Phantom's vaudeville show and has dreams of stardom while Madame Giry is a bit more questionable. She remains loyal to the Phantom but questions his motivations and is angered that he shows little interest in Meg.

When Christine is summoned to sing in New York by the famous composer Oscar Hammerstein, the Phantom, upon knowing Christine is in town, intercepts and has members of his troupe pick her up at the pier along with Raoul and Gustave. The Phantom, who for years has longed to be reunited with Christine, wants her to sing at his ""Phantasma"" and has written a song specifically for her. The story is laced with love, bitter love, passion, obsession and betrayal and at the centre of this is the always vulnerable Christine who again has to chose between the 2 polarizing men in her life.

Simply put. I love this show. This newer version of this relatively new show moves much better than the original staging which did have a lot of unnecessary scenes. The most obvious revision was with the Phantom's song ""Till I Hear You Sing"" which was moved from the middle of act 1 to the opening number. Although ""Love Never Dies"" is very different than the original ""Phantom"", Webber's music is varied and still majestic with its sweeping melodies and glorious orchestrations. The original was darker. Its location and time, the Paris Opera house in the late 19th century, demanded a more classical tone. Webber succeeded and created some hauntingly beautiful songs and mock operas with some dark, atmospheric music. Although ""Love Never Dies"" is a follow up, it is a totally different animal. There are lesser moments of operatic grandeur and since it takes place in the confinement of a Coney Island amusement park, there are a whole array of quirky, colorful images and characters. The music fits this scene. It is sumptuous with the Phantom and Christine, as expected, having the best tunes of the bunch but unlike the original musical where Raoul didn't really have a solo number, he is given a great tune here (""Why Does She Love Me""). The songs here are not as instantly catchy so it may take a few extra listens for the viewer/listener to appreciate the full beauty of some of these melodies but once embedded in your head, you may find yourself humming several of these tunes. Some of the score is very reminiscent of ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", even ""Cat's"" and despite some less than memorable numbers, the positives in the score far outweigh the negatives.

Many have complained about the drastic changes to the characters. Unlike some reviewers, I find these changes refreshing. As much as I love ""Phantom of the Opera"", with the exception of the Phantom and that Grande Diva ""La Carlotta"", the characters are a bit bland. Raoul and Meg for instance, were a bit boring. Meg especially is under-utilized and severely under-developed. Although Christine herself was interesting in the sense that she sang the best tunes in the show (she is in almost every scene), she spends most of her time in a trance so there is not much range of emotion and she was far too nave to excite any real sympathy (I think this is where the movie worked, because Rossum's youth made this naivet believable). That was then, this is now as Raoul, Meg and Madame Giry have been turned to more complex characters, loud, selfish, maybe not as likeable but so be it. They are the complete opposite to how they were portrayed in the original musical. Raoul's drastic transformation is believable to me because, well, we didn't really get to know him in the original piece. He was simply a stiff, rich pretty boy who was in love with Christine and who was more than willing to place her, the love of his life, in danger to try to capture the Phantom during the staging of his ""Don Juan Triumphant"". Also a lot can happen in 10 years. The guy is made more human and this is not far-fetched. The 2 main characters remain the same overall. The Phantom remains as obsessive, as dangerous, as loving as ever; although more human, we do not see many magic tricks here. Christine, although more mature, still retains the charming characteristics of a decade earlier.

The leads are great. Ben Lewis (The Phantom) and Anna O'Byrne (Christine) are both fantastic with solid vocals and great stage presence, delivering just the right amount of emotion. I am very picky with stage Christine's. After watching Rebecca Caine's (Canadian Cast) sublime performance in Toronto 2 decades ago, I have not been able to find a Christine that commanded my attention the way Caine did  (and I've seen the show 18 times). O'Byrne is almost as spellbinding. She is beautiful and the score really shows off her wonderful soprano. While the original musical was the ""Phantom's"" show, this is clearly Christine's show. Simon Gleeson is also noteworthy for portraying the sometimes really unlikeable but far more interesting-this-time around Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney. While Raoul was a cookie cutter pretty boy with no real personality the first time around, he is an embittered, angry-at-the-world failure here.

The costumes and sets are wonderful. Despite not having any crashing chandeliers or subterranean lakes, the musical is a spectacle. The Phantom's lair this time around is more modernized. Gone are the thousand, melting, flickering candles. It is now an overwhelming, crazy maze of steel, smoke and mirrors.

Some of the highlights include:

""Till I Hear You Sing"" - An emotional ballad sung by the Phantom. Beautiful and melodic. Ben Lewis' rich tones are splendid. A great opening scene.

""The Coney Island Waltz"" - Originally this was an instrumental piece. This revised version is a full blown ensemble piece with added lyrics. It is visually a spectacular number.

""Look With Your Heart"" - A lovely ditty sung by Christine and her son Gustave. A bit sugary but Webber's melody is so sweet and O'Byrne's vocals soar.

""Beneath A Moonless Sky"" and ""Once Upon Another Time"" - This entire scene between the Phantom and Christine during their first reunion is a powerful one. ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"" is one of my favorite songs from the musical and noticed changes were made to the lyrics.

""The Beauty Underneath"" - Although this song sticks out like a sore thumb since the screeching guitars and drums differs from the romantic strings of previous songs, it works. The melody is infectious and the mix of the 2 voices, the Phantom and the young Gustave, is a good combination.

""Why Does She Love Me"" - Showcases Raoul in all of his tormented glory.

""Love Never Dies""- I love this song. Christine's aria written specifically for her by the Phantom is beautifully sung by O'Byrne and here, she is a site to behold. If ever there was a number where the costume and set take centre stage, it is this one. However Webber and O'Byrne's talents ensure that we are not mesmerized just by the scenery, but the music, the voice, the performance all contribute to making this a fantastic scene.

The DVD/Blu-ray picture quality is sharp and the sound quality is fantastic. Watch this on a big screen with the volume turned up for maximum effect. A ""Making of"" documentary with cast interview is also included. Overall, a beautiful transfer.

""Love Never Dies"" works for me as a sequel and as a standalone piece despite the drastic changes. Those enamored with the syrupy romance of the original may find plenty to dislike here as this tale deviates considerably from its predecessor and as previously mentioned, the stark changes in character personalities may be hard for many to swallow. I do find this to be Webber's best musical since ""Sunset Boulevard"". Taking into account the setting, the music successfully captures the era and the love songs in typical Webber fashion are gorgeous. The score may sound repetitious at times and there are also brief moments in the score where melodies from Webber's original piece, ""Little Lotte"", ""Twisted Every Way"", are mixed in with the new, but there is no denying the beauty that permeates the score. When the Phantom burst into his songs and Christine beautifully sings her aria showcasing her delicate soprano, it all comes together to create a certain magic. The Phantoms return may not please all but if you are accepting of it, you may find yourself surrendering to the music all over again.",1400198400,,9696,4.853599516031458

4986652,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I wasn't sure what to expect the when watching this for the first time.  The Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite musicals and I feared this sequel would ruin the story.  In my opinion, it did not.  It seems you either love it, or hate it. The sets that were used were amazing, as were the costumes and actors.  The child that portrayed Gustave was outstanding!  I do have to agree with another person that submitted a review that there were far too many close up's which made the microphone's on the actor's foreheads stand out.  At times, I feel that's all I was looking at!

The music was good, but nothing like The Phantom.  Every now and then you'd hear familiar tunes from The Phantom. I must say there is a scene with Raoul and the Phantom in the bar that has become one of my favorite scenes in any musical!

The story portrays Raoul a lot more harshly than in the original but that was okay with me because I never much cared for him anyways. I would have hoped the ending was going to be happier, but I should have known better.  All in all, I don't think it was as bad as some people made it out to be.  You can't really compare it to the Phantom.  Sequel's for movies rarely turn out better than the first so for a musical sequel, I think it was very well.  It's a shame it got such negative reviews and will not be performed in the USA because I wouldn't mind seeing it live.",1394496000,,1394,4.156716417910448
4986653,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw The Phantom of the Opera when I was 12, and I heard the Original London Cast Recording of Love Never Dies when I was 16. By then my life had gone through some MAJOR changes. For one thing my Dad died 2.75 months after I saw The Phantom of the Opera on stage (believe it or not) and my life was continuing to get worse, so my personality like the characters in ""Love Never Dies"" changed with life. What I'm trying to  say is ""Misery loves company"" especially from close friends. When I was 13 I had read ""The Phantom of Manhattan"" so it was not a surprise to me when Christine died. :(!

In a class called ""Working with Young Children"" I learned that If a child is born less than a year into a marriage it most likely falls apart, which contributes WHY Christine chooses the Phantom. Furthermore, Gustave's attraction to music, and also having the same concept  of beauty as the Phantom, can be explained by the existence of the Hobby Gene. This means that because both of his parents like music, he is more likely to as well.

Also gambling was popular among rich people during the time that the Phantom of the Opera was set.  This would most likely result in a lower income, which would put stress on Raoul and Christine's marriage, Which would contribute to WHY Christine chooses the Phantom.  Raoul in the original novel is immature and immature people are impulsive, and do things like drink too much, and gamble.  I know that the dates between ""Love Never Dies"" and the auction at the beginning of ""The Phantom of the Opera are correct because alcoholism causes premature aging, by reducing the amount of collagen, (which is what makes your skin look young)  by reducing amount of the antioxidant vitamin A which is important in slowing down the signs of aging

 But what Meg said before she shot her sounded JUST like I was feeling by the time I was 16. (added to that my relationship with my sister had gone tough the same stages as Meg and Christine's in ""Love Never Dies"" the Australian production in the past eight years at the time) but I HADN'T killed anybody. Why? Because our undying love we've had since we were children, for our family (including pets) friends, jobs,our favorite media, hobbies, and interests, and ourselves enables us not to change when change is making our world fall apart around us, even over a period as long as ten years. We are the same people we always were because love never dies that's what misery causing change taught me, and ""Love Never Dies"" affirmed. When I saw the DVD The blocking for ""Please Miss Giry I Want to go Back"" made it look like Meg MEANT to shoot Christine. Also she has UNTREATED Bipolar Disorder, and has these symptoms:

1. Feeling unusually ""high"" and optimistic OR extremely irritable
2. Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about one's abilities or powers
3. Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic
4. Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next
5. Impaired judgment and impulsiveness
6. Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences
7. Delusions and hallucinations (in severe cases)

I now know why I didn't kill, because I got the emotional support and love Meg didn't get from ""Love Never Dies"", and with out it I definitely wouldn't be where I am right now.",1394409600,,3271,4.640138408304498

I also never thought of Raul as one whose character changed from loving and kind to a drunkard and leaching off his wife's money which Love Never Dies reveals.

4986671,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I've seen Phantom of the Opera in NYC, as well as the recently released blu-ray recording. This latest effort of Andrew Lloyd Webber just doesn't measure up to his earlier work. Sure, the sets are spectacular, costumes were top-notch, and musicality was excellent. I don't fault any of the cast or crew here.

Webber's music compositions here just feel uninspired. Chord progressions are so predictable and and bit bland. Lyrics fare a bit better, but there's nothing new here. There's a reason this musical only lasted 18 months in London.

I'm a fan of Webber, but I hold him to a high standard. This is not up to par in my book for him. I don't care what Webber lovers here say regarding this sequel (it's crazy to rate this 5 stars). It IS a sequel to Phantom of the Opera. By now we all know how sequels to almost anything fare these days. The track record isn't pretty.

Regarding the blu-ray quality, overall video and audio is excellent, but there are way too many editing cuts to different camera angles (like a rock concert) instead of shots of the entire stage so we could enjoy the impressive sets. I know this video was filmed to allow audiences to experience close-ups of the actors and to get more of the emotion they're trying to convey, but there were too many unnecessary cuts to different angles here. Some camera operators struggled to keep a few shots in focus as well.

There is one special feature (making-of) that was mediocre. It showed some backstage shots, but also used footage from the show itself. Basically, this was more of a love-fest for the Australian production and cast instead of a true making-of production of the musical itself.

I'd suggest a rental before committing to buy, except for the die-hard Webber fans.",1390003200,,1753,4.678571428571429

Its about everyone and how the last three years have truly changed them into the people they've become. I couldn't have imagined it any other way...well, maybe the ending; I won't spoil it but I may have changed that. I understand that people didn't like it so much but I definitely think that everyone should at least try it. This show holds so much emotion and meaning. It brings to life so much power and depth.

They were right. This adaptation feels more like a horribly rushed twisted fan-fiction in response the original Broadway, instead of a well thought-out, well composed sequel. I expected so much more from ALW. The effects and sets are BEYOND fantastic, but the actual storyline and music score are subpar.

It destroys most of the original storyline, fantasy, magic, romance and everything else you loved about the original Broadway. I regret seeing this and will recommend anyone who deeply loved the original storyline, NOT watch this.

The plot twist is unnecessary and just plain absurd!

If you do your research, you'll see ALW based the first play on the original book from the early 1900's and then made up the sequel on his own. I feel, it was to fill some strange fan boyish void he harbored for the original story.

The sequel does no justice to the original. Christine has been converted into some sort of confused lovesick girl in a loveless marriage, while Raoul goes on to become a gambling alcoholic. Their 10-year-old child is caught in the middle of the convoluted story arc.

I find the entire plot hard to swallow, stupid and unnecessary. The songs have no melody and feel rushed and jumbled. The performers are top notch, but even they cannot bring to life this terrible mush.",1388966400,8,1522,4.768060836501901

4986683,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Without giving too much away...I do find the general plot to be a *bit* of a stretch, but what saves this from a lower rating is: the GORGEOUSNESS & lushness of the score, the (IMHO) amazing acting of every member of this cast (which I've actually come to prefer over the original London cast), & the amazing set & design of the whole show.

I watched a number of clips that were amateurly recorded of the London production. I also listened to the official concept album with the original London cast. The music is good in both, however, the execution & multi-dimensional storytelling in this Australian production is truly awesome.

If you're looking for Ramin Karimloo & Sierra Boggess in the lead roles, you won't find them here. However, Ben Lewis as the Phantom & Anna O'Byrne are every bit as good, if not better.

It should also be noted that this Australian production was much more successful than the original London one. This time, they got it absolutely right.  I highly recommend it to any ""phan"" of Phantom of the Opera, Andrew Lloyd Webber, or musicals in general.

If you haven't seen Phantom of the Opera, I would suggest either reading the following Wikipedia article so you understand the background, and/or watching the ""Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall - 25th Anniversary Celebration"" either on Netflix or Amazon Instant Video.

It's very rare for me to find fault with Andrew Lloyd Webber, but this was atrocious.  It takes everything that was good and pure about Phantom of the Opera and destroys it.  The story of the Phantom by Gaston Leroux is so much more dark and disturbing.  Webber took that story and created a brilliant musical that touched hearts through the music.  What happens in this completely undermines everything beautiful about Phantom.  I have always viewed the Phantom as the dark soul that didn't understand love, only obsession.  He was the stalker who only at the end of his life realized his mistake.  Raoul was the light in the dark for Christine.  He was literally the sun in the dark world the phantom had trapped Christine in.  To turn around and try to convince the audience that Christine regretted her choice and ran back to the phantom to sleep with him that very night is wrong.  It was much like Stockholm Syndrome in that regards, which it really is if you've read the novel and know how dark it is.  Not to mention the Phantom running away because he was scared is completely out of character.  He would never have done that.  He wanted Christine at all costs.  He would never have run away if she came to him willingly, especially then.  Then there's the child he conceived with her, the drunk and gambling Raoul, and the utterly horrific carnival music.

4986705,2,B006GHA9VQ,"I actually know the answer to the question posed in this review's title.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was pure gold in every way imaginable.  And being pure gold there would most certainly be the seductive urge to nurse yet again at the teats of the cash cow.  And there might not have been anything wrong in doing a sequel!  After all, as far as cinematic sequels go BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN was a much better film than FRANKENSTEIN and GODFATHER II was likewise superior to part one of the Corleone story.  Now if a story had come along that was really and truly worth the effort of coming forth with a follow-up to Eric's sad saga, then so be it. More power to all the powers-that-be concerned!

But LOVE NEVER DIES tells a completely cliched, totally unbelievable, sappy, sloppy, silly story that seems to involve none of the characters from the original musical production, even though they may be tagged with the same names and similar costumes. If the original PHANTOM is heightened soap opera, these are the suds and suds only.  The story - and the song lyrics largely used to tell that story - absolutely reeks.

As to Sir Andrew's music, I must say that I really enjoyed a few selections.  The opening song ""Til I Hear You Sing"" is the best number in the entire show.  It is far richer and romantic than the title song itself.  ""The Beauty Underneath"" is a catchy, driven song, as is ""Devil Take the Hindmost.""  And Christine and Gustave's duet - ""Look With Your Heart"" - is touching and tender.  These melodies - not the ding-dong lyrics - are what is worth the rather low price of the DVD.  (Unfortunately, I don't think that the soundtrack to this production has been released yet on CD.)  One thing, though, about Sir Andrew's music:  beautiful as it so overwhelmingly can be, there is much in it that sounds derivative.  I remember years ago Sir Andrew was on a talk show and told the story of how his father reminded him that one of his signature songs  - ""Memory""  - sounded much like a melody from some Italian opera.  I've noted this imitative tendency also.  In the original POTO, every time I'd hear ""Music of the Night"" I couldn't help but hear the beginning melody of the song ""School Days"".  And the driving musical intro to the main song for POTO is identical to a few licks from a piece in Prokofiev's score for ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  So it is with many of the songs in LOVE NEVER DIES: the title song has much in common with Kern's ""You Are Love"" from SHOWBOAT mixed together with another source melody which title eludes me.  Even ""Til I Hear You Sing"" sounds hauntingly familiar, with a smidgen of ""Evergreen"" in it - but the refrain is definitely bugging me because I have heard it elsewhere. It will hopefully come to me - and when it does I will add to these comments. Despite these observations, Sir Andrew is still a great, great composer.  And, despite the syrupy storyline of LOVE NEVER DIES, it is still worth a look and listen - even if just to hear some rich and rewarding music.  But be forewarned: if you wish to keep your precious memories of the original magnificent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA inviolate...then pass this one by.",1381449600,10,3151,4.5132275132275135

While the original was set in an opera house it seemed like more of a sideshow. Here, set in a sideshow t's truly more of an opera than the original. The music ties in to the original score without repeating it.
If you loved ""Phantom"" and want to know what happened next, this is the only way I've found that tries to explore that and worth a look. The actors' voices are marvelous, especially the boy's.
My only criticism is the camera work. You simply can't get the intended impact of a staged production because the camera chooses t to focus on close-ups and narrow views of the stage.

4986717,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I've had a 20 year obsession with Phantom of the Opera, so when I heard about this it got my attention. But after reading details, I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. I hated the idea of the dashing, romantic Raoul being turned into a drunken gambler, of his marriage to Christine on the rocks, or of the change in the characters of Mdm Giry and Meg. But curiosity got the better of me and I rented it. I hated it, just as I suspected I would. I disliked Ben Lewis as the Phantom, thinking his facial expressions grotesque. But it consumed my every thought, and I watched it again. And again. I liked Beneath A Moonless Sky and downloaded it, then Till I Hear You Sing, Love Never Dies, then the entire soundtrack. I watched it every night, and decided I must really love hating it. Somewhere I stopped being such a mean critic, and came to truly appreciate the depth and emotion Lewis puts into the Phantom, and realized that Love Never Dies COMPLETES the story (just ignore the dates). The costumes are exquisite, the music is beautiful, and I hardly think anyone could portray the Phantom's utter heartbreak better than Lewis. His tall, lean, well dressed physique exudes confidence, quite a commanding presence, and O'Byrne displays all the grace and poise one would expect of a vicomtesse.  I'm hooked, just as I was with POTO 20 years ago, and a month after discovering it I still watch part of it every night, and listen to the CD every day. I wish I could have seen Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess as the Phantom and Christine, and I wish I could get a CD of Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne. Karimloo and Boggess have excellent voices, but Lewis has a richness and O'Byrne a sweetness that I prefer.
The only fault I can find is the mispronunciation of Pagliacci (reporter - intended, I assume) and Cherbourg (by Raoul, both soundtrack and film).",1379116800,3,1849,4.519402985074627

Second, there are some surprises in this production that are very interesting - primarily, that the attitudes of Raul (the Vicomte) and Meg Geary (the daughter of Ms Geary who rescued the Phantom from his captivity) have changed drastically from 'Phantom'; I guess time makes changes in all our characters, and you will have to accept that in order to enjoy this whole thing.  I did enjoy it; it is good, but not great as is the original 'Phantom' (what could be??).  Webber is still a marvelous composer, and although there is a different lyricist for this show, the music and the songs are very good.  If you liked (or as I did, loved) 'Phantom', you would do well to try this one - especially at the excellent price.",1379030400,2,794,4.609929078014185

The costumes, the powerful acting and singing of the main characters and the 3 clowns is superb.  Can't put it down, shut it off, leave the room.  Spellbinding. and o so dark, very sinister, frightening. Gives goosebumps.  Stresses look for the beauty underneath.  Maybe too dark for some viewers.  Probes the dark side of humans and what they choose to do to get their end. Shows the triumph of the higher side of human nature, too, when disaster stuns. It is a soap opera musical set on stage in a grand larger than very dark life way.  And it completes, is the follow up to the Phantom of the Opera.  I am ready for another  follow up!

BUT I was disappointed that Ramin was not in the film.  Neither was Sierra. Why not?!!!

I believe Gaston Leroux would be rolling over in his grave.  There were some truly amazing staging effects, thoughthe story line really didn't seem to go anywhere until the very end with heightened suspense.  The development of both the characters as well as the story line just didn't seem plausible given the original.  Without actually giving away some of the plot's secrets, it is difficult to imagine Christine Daae willing to give up all for a now sympathetic phantom character, considering his previous murderous insanity.  The music itself, though lovely, rendred no significant memorable melodies to sing along with.  Webber really should have quit while he was ahead.",1372809600,,844,5.116788321167883

4986747,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I really enjoyed this representation of the second part of the Phantom's tale. The Australian cast did a fantastic job. Of course, my favorites were Erik the Phantom and Christine Daae.

The songs ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"", ""Beautiful,"" ""The Phantom Confronts Christine,"" and ""Love Never Dies"" serve as a splendid platform with which to communicate to the audience the passion and love Erik and Christine still feel for each other.

(Spoiler Alert...) The only thing that was disappointing about the story was Christine's death at the end of the film by the actions of an enraged and disturbed Meg Giry. Though, plot twists at the end of a tale are great points of discussion and serve as thought-provoking reminders that just because an ending may appear to be heading in the fairy tale direction, doesn't necessarily mean they will end up that way.

Overall, a great addition to the realm of unrequited love. :)",1372204800,2,912,4.909090909090909

Once you've seen and heard Gerard Butler (Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raul), nobody else who plays these roles will do.  I enjoyed the story line but I couldn't help but feel something wonderful was missing and that was the three actors I mentioned.  Since the 2004 movie, I've followed these 3 actors career's and find Gerard Butler just becomes sexier and sexier.  I'm afraid I'm one of his groupies.  And I've found Patrick Wilson in many movies (not musicals) and he is quite a hottie too.

4986767,4,B006GHA9VQ,"Love never dies is the sequel to what most people consider to be ALW's masterpiece: The Phantom of the Opera. While it has some great tunes (my personal favorite being ""Till I hear you sing""), you might not want to go jumping in right away.

This production comes to us via Australia, and let me tell you there is some amazing talent down under. All of the cast members are absolutely fantastic. Even the little characters leave you wanting more. The relationship between Christine and The Phantom lives on, and the chemistry here is pretty impressive. I won't give away too much detail, but I will say that those of you who know the story will enjoy the way it's portrayed here.

That being said, fans of the original draft album will be disappointed as some of the lyrics and song order had been changed. As I said at the start, ""Till I hear you sing"" is my absolute favorite from this piece, but I do wish the lyrics to this piece had remained the same. Still, none of this takes away from the beauty of the show and I must say there is a lot to be had here.

The set and character designs look like something out of a Tim Burton movie, and I love it :). They're built beautifully and it shows that this is the Phantoms territory :). Also, there is no doll for Christine. I personally always found the doll to be kind of creepy, so I don't miss it. There is a portrait, but that's far healthier than some doll (seriously, that thing is creepy).

When I heard he was writing a new play for the phantom I was wanting to see it but after seeing this I was beyond disappointed with it and wishing that it was never written and I like both Sunset Blvd and Whistle down the wind, but this should have never been made in to a show on any stage. At least it was shot on stage like I wish they had done with Phantom so you get to see the true show as it is, doesn't save it in anyway but at least you get to see it as it should be.

But let me tell you, this is an eyes opener to both of the performance and the stage production.  It was translated and perform with greatest care.  This Love Never Dies' DVD is highly recommended for people who love excellent performance.  Eventhough it had been recorded which I does not care about the intension, but the casts and crews were amazing.

The music was fantastic as Andrew's music always is, but there were a few points where the performers vocal range was not quite as dynamic as I would have liked.

However, if you're a big follower of The Phantom of the Opera, there are going to be a few things that stick out like sore thumbs.. The main one being That Christine's child is really The Phantom's and not Raouls... It makes since to me with how ALW writes the story. I can see it annoying others though.",1363392000,,356,4.25
4986803,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I love this play. It has amazingly haunting music and the Australian sets are very stunning. Anna Obyrne and Ben Lewis are truly amazing both at singing and acting. In fact the entire cast is truly very gifted and talented. I myself love it. I long for the day I can see it live.

That being said its really not for everyone. The story is very far-fetched and forced. Fortunetly its not quite as ridiculous as the London version was. The major problems in that performance were addressed and noticeable changes were made to fill in gaps and make both the story and the characters much more likeable. Its a bandaid when it probably needed stitches, but it works.

If you can look at this peice as not meaning to be a logical in-character developmental story that continues where the original left off and accept it for what it is and laugh at the stuff that doesnt make sense without getting worked up, you will enjoy it. If you are stuck on certain characters would never do this or dates not matching up or unable to let go of your personal ship, then you will not like it.

The music is truly amazing and the costumes and sets are incredible. While the story may not make a whole lot of sense, its still a great play. Anyone who can go in with an open mind should have no problem finding something to enjoy about it.

Just think of this as an ""adaptation"" and not really a ""sequel"". To me its like trying to tie ""Wicked"" in with ""Wizard Of Oz"". There are major plot holes but they are both great musicals even if they don't tie in together perfectly. You look at them as 2 different musicals and 2 different stories even though they have essentially the same characters. And honestly thats how you have to look at ""Love Never Dies"" too.

4986806,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I knew from the first time that I heard the music that Gaston Leroux would be turning over in his grave at the direction that his characters had been taken in. That being said, in what other direction could a Phantom of the Opera sequel go? The story of the Phantom of the Opera was wrapped up so nicely, both in the book and in the Lloyd Webber telling, as to prevent a good sequel being possible.

The sequel was created anyway. And, like any good Phantom of the Opera fan, I was drawn to it, even realizing that it couldn't possibly be good. Our beloved characters became people that they never would have become and did things that they never would have done. Christine's fate seemed to be the best possible ending. It would have been a shame for her to discover that she was merely the prize in a cock fight, for lack of a better term. The final showdown between the Phantom and Raoul demonstrated, not a great love for our heroine, but a fervent desire to win.

Still, no one tells a bad story quite as well as Andrew Lloyd Webber. I enjoyed watching it, in spite of its short comings. The sets were gorgeous, a few of the songs had merit, and the singing was good.",1362960000,,1171,4.294117647058823

The singing is amazing, the sets are truly fantastic, and the songs are quite good (not as good as Phantom of the Opera, of course). My favorite song (the song that starts out the play) is ""Till I Hear You Sing"" and it is a very emotionally powerful song. The only things I didn't really like (without giving too much away, though others probably have) would mostly be Meg's character and I do not like how they made Raoul an alcoholic and a couple other things (again, don't want to give anything away).

2)  Andrew L-W personally approved and guided the production, proclaiming it to be the version he envisioned.

I like the plot, enjoyed the costumes and inventive set, and quite a few of the songs.  However some of the characters just don't ring true somehow.  Its hard to follow up a sequel that uses none of the original cast, but I think its more of a plot issue than an actor one.

I read an interview with ALW about the storyline.  Here's the scoop, Christine seeks out the Phantom and spends the night with him AFTER the end of the last story, the phantom wakes up before Christine, realizes he can't give her what she needs (or so he thinks)and he leaves and makes his way to Coney Island. You can actually pick up on most of the one-night-stand story if you listen really close to Christine's and Phantom's duet 'Beneath a Moonless Sky'.  Hence how he can look so 'surprised' when she kisses him at the end of Phantom of the Opera; it really was their first kiss.  Raoul goes from hero to zero because at heart, he's always been a spoiled rich boy and couldn't deal with Christine's talent and popularity, forcing her to give up performing for the last 5 years (you can pick up on that too if you listen carefully).  He is unhappy because he (rightfully)realizes he cannot give Christine the music that she desperately craves and because of this, she will never truly be happy with him.  This of course, drives him to excessive drinking and gambling, wracking up the debt that eventually causes him to finally let Christine perform again for a huge sum that will help the family's financial woes.  I really didn't find the one-night-stand or Raul's alchoholism huge character stretches. The music in Love Never Dies is ok but NO WHERE NEAR as good as Phantom of the Opera unfortunately.  It just didn't have the big epic emotional feel of the first score.  But, all in all, if you're a Phantom phan, I think you should at least watch this to close out the story.

4986831,3,B006GHA9VQ,"In this follow-up to Phantom of the Opera, it is a reach on so many levels.  After seeing both Broadway productions, traveling productions and the made for screen film, I have been a fan of the Webber version of Phantom.  I realize that each musical is unique, but this is not one of the great ones you come to expect from Mr. Webber.  The soundtrack does not have a single outstanding song to focus upon afterward to bring back images of the musical.
The overall story is great and grows each of the characters Phantom, Christine and Raoul.  The most talented singer from this musical was by the Phantom's Ben Lewis.  The rest of the cast was good, but not to the level expected for this size of production.
It was a good attempt by Mr. Webber, but not ever venture will be a great hit.  Watch it for what it is and do not expect too much from this musical.",1358985600,,858,4.298136645962733
4986832,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I watched Phantom of the Opera at the royal Albert Hall and fell in love with that production. I agree with some reviewers in that Love never Dies is completely different. It's style is more gothic but the score is still very memorable. I love Ben lewis' portrayal of the phantom in this particular production. I also love Ramin Karimloo in POTO. However, I prefer Ben Lewis for Love Never Dies because the whole production is so different. He is meant to sound older, darker, more masculine. At this point in the story, he is a broken man pining for his lost love. I love his deep baritone voice and the way he is stylized is almost vampiric, like he has truly become a Coney Island freak. I think Lloyd-Weber meant for that.  His facial expression and body language were particularly moving and believable. I also loved Sierra Boggess in POTO and she is incredibly talented in other productions as well. Again, this is a wholly different production. Anna O'Byrne was a perfect Christine for this production. Andrew Lloyd Weber cast the  Lewis and O'Byrne for a reason. Their voices are very complimentary. They have such great on screen chemistry. They really knew how to act for the theatre and for the camera. One thing POTO fans can appreciate is the use of dramatic entrances and exits and the use of gas lights and smoke. There are a couple of particular scenes that come to mind. When Christine first gets off the boat, and walks into the crowd of paparazzi, the music and for and lighting make it look like she's walking out of a dream...It's beautiful. Also, the phantom's entrance prior to ""Beneath a Moonless sky"" is breathtaking. There are some tid bits of POTO lyrics. For example, when the phantom sees Christine get off the boat, he sings,"" I am your angel of music, come to me angel of music.""

About the camera...I understand that they wanted a really dramatic look. They intended for it to look more like a movie, less like a theatrical show. I wish they would have zoomed out more and shown the scene changes. It seemed like there was too little time between each song to really let the songs sink in. Still, the sets, costumes, score, and performances were phenomenal. Just wish I could see it live! Definitely worth the purchase.",1358985600,2,2251,4.636591478696742

Nope, just a faint hint of the music of Masquerade to make you recall the original but definitely NOT a sequel and not meant to be. It will still leave you hanging. I think for me and many others who did not like this production the reason we watched it was because we had hoped the Phantom and Christine would have finally gotten together. It was just heart breaking to see Phantom cry at the end of the first one and Christine just walk away and run off with Raoul. The Phantom also is pretty wimpy in this one. He was just not the Phantom we have grown to love and Raoul was a mean controlling drunk. Not very creative in my honest opinion. I would stream it first as a rental before I buy it if I were you.

First let me say that what I am about to write will be SPOILERS, So read no further unless you want to know what happens.

They actually changed things about the original Phantom of the Opera (POTO) to try to make this sequel work and it was very disappointing!
Any of you who have seen POTO remember the final lair scene where Christine kisses Erik (phantom) and the look on his face is just pure shock because no one has EVER kissed him or shown him any affection at all.
Now in the sequel Love Never Dies it turns out that Christines son is actually Eriks......COME ON!!! and you find out that they actually made love one night all those years ago.
So then why did Erik act so shocked when Christine kissed him in POTO?

4986839,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I'll be honest, the first time I saw, in writing, a synopisis of Love Never dies, I wanted to go die in a hole. When I listened to the music, it did little to soothe my aching, Phantom-loving soul. Howevvveeeerrr...I got bored and watched it. That sounds really mean of me, but hey. I'm being honest. You have to watch the play to enjoy the music, in my opinion. Now, the idea (Phantom in Coney Island? Really?) is a bit crazy. You'll find that it works a lot better on stage than it does in your head. Sure, Anna O'Byrne isn't Sierra Boggess, but I think she (Anna, that is) has a bit more down to earth idea of Christine than Sierra did.
  It'll never approach the epicness of the original, but that doesn't mean this one isn't good too. It's got really emotional moments, although I do think the Phantom has softened in his old age. Meg, however, hasn't. There's a few drastic character changes in there, but I don't regret it.

To me the love story had been about Raoul & Christine and love conquers all. In this sequel it turns out that the Phantom really was nothing more than a Pedophile and a stalker. Christine had gotten pregnant by the Phantom then passed the child off as Raouls who had become a drunken gambler and had lost his fortune.

The soundtrack moves me almost immediately when I start listening to it, it draws me in quickly and keeps me entranced for the entire 2:20; this version skips any and all setup that the soundtrack has, and jumps straight into storyline, which is cut down to 2:01. Entire sections are completely different, conversations had have different characters having them.. it doesn't flow nearly as well as the original version.

Like Mr. Llyod webber is going to be able to pull off a sequel to phantom of the opera. ( which was not needed in my opinion.)I thought this muscial sequel was going to be a big flop. Boy was I wrong. Love never dies is spectacular. And it does not take away the magic of the first one. The music is so sweeping and just as powerful as the music to phantom of the opera. The sets were full of vibrant colors and I loved the opening scene of coney Island when all the freaks come out of the circus tent. It was interesting to see what happend to the characters after Phantom but at the same time I hated the changes because it was like they all did a three sixty or one eighty. For example, the phantom to me seemed less mysterious and the fact that christine apparently went back and had a child by him, dosen't really make sense especially since she seemed repulsed by him in Phantom 1 and choose Raoal over him. But then again Raoal became a bit of an ass and a drinker in the sequel, so I guess it makes some sense. And the changes in Meg and madame Giry I also hated. Why would Meg kill christine all because she now wants the phantom? This makes no sense to me since in Phantom 1 the audience was never shown any hostility between Christine andMeg. They were like best friends. Not to mention meg was terrified of the phantom. I think Love Never Dies is easier to look at as a stand alone piece rather then a sequel. But despite some flaws in the story and continuation as well as the annoying way that they had to ryhme every lyric. The sets are stupendous, the costumes wonderful, the singing and the acting are excellent. All in all a five star sequel and musical.",1357257600,,1808,4.168571428571428

4986866,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I will say that ""Love Never Dies"" has to be accepted on it's own terms; it might be considered sacrilege for a number of diehard Phans. There are people who have made up their minds to hate it without experiencing it for themselves.  What the haters refuse to acknowledge is that taste is subjective, and telling people that they ""shouldn't"" like a show because the writer doesn't like it isn't reasonable, and is very disrespectful.  A chacun son gout.  Watch the download and decide for yourself if you want to hedge your bets before buying the Blu-ray/DVD.  Consider this show independent of the 1986 ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and just enjoy the show for yourself.  If you like it, you like it, and if you don't, it's your right, but don't be presumptuous and tell other people that they don't have the right to enjoy this production.  For everyone who comes up with a dozen reasons why this version of ""Love Never Dies"" is wrong, all I can think of is how the music and the performances in this disc moved me emotionally and brought me to tears.  It's been 20 years since I saw a Phantom who made me feel what I felt when I saw this.  This Phantom reminds me why I fell in love with the character in the first place, and why my heart ached for him when he was left by Christine.  And for all the Phangirls who are ticked off saying this is Webber's version of Christine/Sarah who should have stayed with the Phantom, tell me that these same women didn't fantasize about staying with the Phantom themselves, if they had been Christine, at the end of the original show.

I admit to being one of the people who was outraged, outraged I tell you, at the thought that Andrew Lloyd Webber couldn't leave well enough alone. How dare he write a sequel to his greatest success, all for the purpose of making another bundle of cash?!!!  Truth be told, I wasn't a fan of Ramin Karimloo's snarling interpretation of the Phantom.  I'd seen the original Phantom, Michael Crawford, perform the role onstage a few times when Michael Mania ruled the theater world, and individual tickets for his performances were being scalped for thousands of dollars.  Aside from Crawford, I also saw Robert Guillome, and the later iterations of what the Times termed ""industrial strength"" tenors, where the power of the voice overwhelmed the subtle characterization that Crawford had coaxed out of the music on the stage (whatever you hear on the original cast recording, he was 100 times better in person - truly the role of a lifetime).  A trusted friend bought the ""Love Never Dies"" concept discs and derided the plot, and of course the reviews for the show in London were less than kind.  I happened to be flipping channels and caught this from the beginning for the first time on PBS and thought that I might as well watch the thing since it was rather irrational to have an absolute loathing for something without having seen more than the promotional video for one song.  I am now a huge fan thanks to this disc and cast.

I'd vaguely remembered hearing that this Australian production was a big improvement over the London company so I watched, at first with trepidation.  By the time Ben Lewis' Phantom had finished singing his opening number, ""Til I Hear You Sing Once More,"" I realized I was wrong.  I tried resisting, and then was captivated by the lush beauty of the score. Anna O'Byrne makes a wonderful Christine, with a lighter and more controlled voice than Sarah Brightman's current work, and much more measured than Sierra Boggess, who has a tendency to allow the emotion to get the better of her singing.  O'Byrne's rendition of the title song is a moment much like Magnolia in ""Show Boat"" hesitating before she sings ""After the Ball"" or original Christine's tentative first verse of ""Think of Me.""  It transitions into a powerful song with lyrics that speak to anyone who has loved deeply and lost, but survived the experience.  Simon Gleeson happens to be one of those generic interchangeable industrial strength tenors (why do all the Raouls sound exactly the same?), and he's got the thankless task of portraying a lost soul in the midst of a bad marriage.  The tension in the scenes between Raoul and Christine looks uncomfortably familiar to anyone who's been married for more than 10 years; however, Gleeson's duet with Lewis in ""Devil Take the Hindmost"" is a pretty tasty bit of theater.  Maria Mercedes channels Mrs. Danvers as a manipulative, cunning Mme Giry, and poor Sharon Millerchip also has a thankless task in showing us little Meg's descent from hopeful performer on the verge of a big break to a woman scorned in the craziest way possible.

The scenic and costume design are superb; the designer here reminds us why Australians have a reputation for imaginative, over the top design - nothing generic about what's on the stage.  The use of modular track pieces to suggest the Coney Island amusement park are brilliantly utilized, and the over-sized Phantom's mask as the proscenium arch for Phantasma's concert hall is an inspired touch.  The most amazing set pieces are the carousel in the ""Coney Island Waltz"" and the over-sized glass cases in ""The Beauty Underneath,"" as some of the side-show freaks working for the Phantom are revealed.  However, I do have to quibble a bit about the execution in the tailoring and fit of the mens frock coats.  Maria Bjornson did such a phenomenal job with her original designs in 1986, and Crawford's costumes were tailored within an inch of his life, giving the Phantom a touch of the dandy about him.  The reasoning was that since his face was hideous the Phantom used his expensive, perfectly cut clothing as a way to make himself attractive and seductive.  That exquisite tailoring should have been continued here, showing the perceived wealth of Raoul and the financial success of the Phantom.  The problem with Blu-ray on a big screen HDTV is that every pucker, wrinkle, and pull in the fabric shows in the medium and close-up shots.  I was guessing certain costumes were made of a polyester blend because of the way fabric was rippling near the seams, and that took me out of the story on subsequent viewings.  (So this is where I admit to being a former stage and television actress, and being persnickety about what the actors wear, having spent enough of my past life being pinned, poked, and fitted by costume designers 20 years ago.)

Love Never Dies is about grasping the opportunity for a last chance at redemption and healing through love.  For those who complain that it's not canon, canon is the original Leroux novel, and everything that has come after is simply another adaptation.  Like ""Scarlett,"" the Mitchell Estate approved sequel to ""Gone with the Wind,"" or ""Phantom"" by Susan Kaye, this is indeed glorified fan fiction, but what a story!  There are thousands of possibilities in the time period between the Phantom's cri de coeur, ""it's over now, the music of the night"" and the original prologue of Raoul in 1911 singing ""will you still play when all the rest of us are dead?""  Either way, Christine's fate was spelled out in 1986.  I admit that part of me feels that Ben Lewis is about 20 years too young to be playing the Phantom at this stage of life with his unlined face, considering that the Leroux character was an older man, and Crawford was 44 when he created the role.  Going by the Frederick Forsythe book as the basis for LND, the Phantom here is closer to a contemporary of Christine, so in the disconnect between the two ALW versions, unless the Phantom's magical powers included freezing or bending time, the change would have made him a teen at the time he created the maze of mirrors for the Shah of Persia in the original, but I digress.  The original Phantom has lived multiple lives in his roles as side-show freak, magician, composer, architect, and Opera Ghost.  I've found that Lewis may be young but he has the charisma and gravitas to pull it off.

Ben Lewis is truly heartbreaking as the Phantom.  He exposes the yearning soul of this tortured man who has learned to come out of the shadows and operate above ground in his park, Phantasma.  Yes, the Phantom does fall back on old methods in resorting to threats to get Christine to agree to sing in his concert hall, but on discovering the truth about little Gustave, he finds another path to redeeming himself, and his generosity of spirit is expressed here.  The monster has a heart and soul that can be mended.  I have to say that Ben Lewis has one of the truly great voices of musical theater, a breathtaking instrument, and I hope that he has the opportunity to work in the U.S., because I would love to see him from the seats of a theater, rather than on my home screen.  His use of nuance in posture, holds, and turning is well-crafted, and he's got a great crazy stare in the moments when it's warranted.  I also noticed he uses his hands in a way that echoes Crawford's original performance, and it's a lovely nostalgic touch for someone who saw the original Phantom in the flesh.  The chemistry between Lewis and Anna O'Byrne here is palpable.  You absolutely believe their history and unbreakable bond.

I highly recommend this for anyone who's willing to open up their mind and go beyond the original show, and it's a vast improvement over the travesty of the film version of Phantom with Gerard Butler.  This Angel of Music has a voice that soars and seeps into your consciousness, then remains there like the echoes of your long-lost love.  It's well worth your time and money.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-Original-1986-London-Cast/dp/B00004YTY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)</a>",1356652800,2,9768,4.7718360071301245
4986867,3,B006GHA9VQ,"At first, I thought like most others: WTF.  But then, as the story went on, I started realizing something about the ""conflicts"" in the characters.

By the end of the original musical:
Phantom - had been forced to face his own ugliness within.  With that, he found his heart truly open up and he let the one woman who brought him happiness go.  He sacrificed his music for her heart.

Christine - had believed that as long as she had music in her life, she would feel loved.  But, she learned that the music is not enough to make your heart fly - she grew up.  In the end, she sacrificed her music for her heart.

Raoul - he found himself in a position where he had to become a real man.  His love for Christine forced him to sacrifice himself.  For probably the first time in a viscount's life, he that getting what he wanted wasn't always possible.  He sacrificed his silver spoon world view for her heart.

Madame Giry - she saw a form of friendship with the Phantom and was faced with the choice of betrayal.  Did she betray Christine by leaving her to the Phantom?  Or did she betray the Phantom by helping Raoul?  In the end, she sacrificed the Phantom's trust in her for Christine and Raoul's love.

Meg - she was a talented dancer on her way to becoming a true talent.  She had no guile, no blemishes on her soul.  She was the opposite of the Phantom - pure innocent beauty.  She had no sacrifice to give.

Now, compare to this sequel:
Phantom - he was as if his final sacrifice in the original had never happened.  He wasn't the Phantom that phans sympathized with.  He was as if Christine had never been.

Christine - she turned back into that flighty little thing that jumped at spiders and couldn't hold a thought in her head.  She was as if the Phantom had never been.

Raoul -  he became an arrogant count.  He forgot that making sacrifices for others is just as important as having fun.  He was as if the Phantom had never been.

Madame Giry - she looked at the Phantom as if he were a tool to her daughter's success.  He was no longer a friend, but a means to an end.  She was as if the Phantom had never been.

Meg - she was caught up in ambition.  She connived and planned.  She tried to usurp Christine's role with the Phantom.  She was willing to kill.  She was as if she had taken the Phantom's ugliness inside her.

Why would Lloyd Webber do this?  Why would he take the characters that we all loved and turn them into their worst possibilities?  My guess:  because he could never take this story forward seriously.  Phans would never have let it be.  He would have been tortured forever.  So, turn it into a story of ""what if the illuminations of the original never happened"".  Take the characters and place them in the deepest places they might have been if they had not faced their demons in the Opera House and give that to the Phans.

I give it three stars for showing me what horrid, unworthy people they could have been.

As for the actual performances, I wonder how much control Lloyd Webber had in this casting.  Christine was awful.  Her voice croaked and cracked throughout.  It was shrill more than it was on key.  I kept saying to myself as she sang ""A toad madame?  Perhaps it is you who are the toad!""  There is no way the Phantom of the original musical would have heard that voice and wanted it for his music.  I do wonder, however, if this was done intentionally as a way to capture the real Christine.  Sarah Brightman's voice was at its best while she was with Lloyd Webber - it was true and clear and had wonderful range and yet remained just shy of controlled.

After leaving Lloyd Webber, she obviously chose to study further and turned herself into a caricature of the talent that once was.  It seems both Christine and Sarah have turned themselves into Carlottas.

Meg's voice left much to be desired also.  But I will allow it with the belief that it is a verbal sign of the loss of her innocence - a few ciggies too many.

Phantom's voice couldn't lift spirits if he had a forklift.  But, again, I will allow it with the belief that it is intentional - to take away that which made him beautiful.

Raoul's voice was the only one that didn't make me cringe. Perhaps it was an attempt to gain sympathy for him.

The songs were OK.  I never felt that pull that I get with the original - that gut wrenching jerk with the first sounds as the chandelier rises; that sense of floating with Music of the Night; that quickening of the heart as we are led to the lair.  This sequel just doesn't have the emotion.  But, when you take the emotional illumination away from the characters, how could it?

As an extra thought, there are many reviews that talk about relationships between Phantom and Christine and between Raoul and Christine.  Everyone is certain that their version is the right version.  Having seen the original musical about a dozen times, with two Christines, four Phantoms, and three Raouls, as well as having the original cast recording, I can tell you that those relationships change for each combination.  Each actor plays the Phantom with a different underlying psyche.  Some portray him as a violent monster, some as a stern father figure, others as a lover.  Their chosen psyche and the chemistry between the actors changes the story every time.  As for Raoul, the original Steve Barton was very weak.  He simply could not hold up against a Michael Crawford Phantom.  But take a strong Raoul and put him against a Phantom in despair and you can see Christine choosing Raoul.  It's all in the chemistry and the portrayals.  None is better than the other, it just changes the story a bit.  That's what makes theatre so wonderful.  The only thing that can kill the original is a poor Christine.  If the actress cannot hold her own, the story loses all hope.",1356480000,,5815,4.417374881964117

This is a masterpiece of a musical, and anyone that truly appreciates good musical Theatre will love this. Maybe some Johnny-come-lately bandwagon fans of Phantom that don't appreciate or understand musicals will complain, but it is truly magical. Yes the actors sing most of the dialog, it's supposed to be like that, duh! It emphasizes the few times that they don't, and continues in the same vein as PTO, and other classic musicals.

I never heard the score from 2 years ago, I just saw the finished version on this Blu-ray. It has been a long time since I have sat down and had my breath taken away while watching a show like this. A Great score, fantastic performances, and visually stunning as well. You'll never believe that these extraordinary sets and smooth scene changes could fit onto one stage. As a technician, I've watched it a few times and am still amazed. Whatever bugs there were in the earlier works (2010 recordings)have all been worked out and perfected in this Blu-ray. I really hope this version comes to the US. I can't wait to see it live. Please, don't be a sheep and decide based on someone else's like or dislike of it. You owe it to yourself to watch it and decide. For a few more years I will dream of playing the part of the Phantom! Thank you Mr. Webber! :)",1356220800,3,1369,4.497991967871486

4986887,4,B006GHA9VQ,"Love Never Dies--the Melbourne, Australia, production--is a beautiful musical with amazing costumes, sets, design, and production. This is all first-rate with the highest production values. Lloyd Webber's music is simply wonderful. Extremely melodic, romantic, and beautiful. I am going to buy the Blu-ray version just for the music and production. The music is characterized by LW's recognizable style, rhythms, and orchestration. He captures all the human emotions perfectly with lovely melodic and tonal music of the highest craftsmanship. I am truly in awe of his musical genius.

Although the story of Love Never Dies follows by ten years that of Phantom of the Opera, and this has been described as the sequel to Phantom by LW himself, LND is not Phantom II. The Phantom acts and appears differently here, and the characters' situations and motivations are different. This does not bother me in the least. This musical can stand on its own, and its music certainly does.

Unfortunately, I cannot give this musical five stars. What were Lloyd Webber and his librettist thinking? Why was this story set in Coney Island, New York, rather than the obvious choice of London. Aren't there plenty of carnival and sideshow performers there? Coney Island seems to me to be a remote and uncharacteristic setting for romantic musicals. I read that this musical got poor reviews and its Broadway production was canceled (although the Australian production I viewed was a revision and quite excellent). (SPOILER ALERT for what follows; details can be learned in the Wikipedia article if you wish.) The reviews and cancellation were wise decisions, since the worst aspect of this musical by far is that the ending is insufferably sad. Believe me, no one wants to come away from a musical that has this ending. Even though there is a moment of touching consolation for the Phantom at the very end, it is simply cruel to subject the protagonist (and us) to so much unwanted tragedy. What musical theater-going customer wants to pay to experience such sadness and subsequent depression? Lloyd Webber is not Verdi. He should save the tragedy for kings, queens, princes, princesses, and other classical noble figures so we lesser mortals can achieve some sort of catharsis through their tragic ends. Perhaps he thought he was composing an opera instead of a musical. In the nineteenth century, some famous operas were revised by impresarios to have happier endings to better attract the public. Although these operas are thankfully not performed with these endings today, I can see why the popular theater-going public would prefer endings that reduce the tragic and increase the romantic, and I agree. Lloyd Webber should take note.",1354406400,2,2720,5.1376975169300225
4986888,1,B006GHA9VQ,I am a HUGE fan of Phantom of the Opera but this story RUINS it.  They should have left it alone.  Not worth the $3.99 I paid to rent it.,1354406400,3,137,3.533333333333333
4986889,2,B006GHA9VQ,"Let's start out by saying that I like the Phantom of the Opera films through their various incarnations, even TV hack jobs like The Phantom of Hollywood, and I really enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical (whcih I have seen about six times), and the movie made from it...but this sequel, Love Never Dies, is one of those projects where one can't help but wonder, ""What was Webber thinking?""

If you are going to move from the Phantom out of Paris, a good place to go would likely be London...but Coney Island?  Could Webber have possibly cheapened the character any more than by taking him from the granduer of the Paris Opera House to an actual freak show on Coney Island?  I don't think so.  And it is in this new setting that the production automatically gets into trouble.  When the Phantom was the single ""freak"" in the original musical, he was someone you could sympathize with, though be repelled by physically and for his persona.  Putting him amongst a lot of evil freaks of Coney Island is something that I am sure others besides myself found not only off-putting, but repulsive.  Many of these characters are out of your worst nightmare.

And then we come to a plot that really stretches your belief.  First off, that Coney Island is where he would come to and set up shop as the mysterious owner of this carnival, but that Madame Giry and her daughter Meg would not only follow him there but work for him.  And Meg is in love with the Phantom.  Yes, I know, that is going some distance for the original musical's characters.  Then into this ugly land comes Christine and Raoul, believing herself summonded to perform for Oscar Hammerstein. Okay, now, I won't spoil any more of the plot, but where I left off is the ""point of no return"" with any possible suspension of our believing in the story.

There is one thing I have to say about the production as a whole...it's very sleep-inducing, especially the first part of the second act.  I fell asleep the first two times I tried sitting through it, and only barely made it on the third.

Music-wise, I hoped to find at least a few songs that might be nice additions to POTP, but with the slight (and I mean very slight) exception of the title tune, there is nothing here to indicate that Webber had anything to do with the music at all (except for one or two musical passages from the original POTO production that have new lyrics).  You don't come away from this humming any notable tunes.

Talent-wise, Ben Lewis makes an adequate Phantom.  Anna O'Burne is a very lovely Christine, and has a beautiful voice to match, which she gets a chance to really use in the second half.

Picture quality is excellent, as likewise is the the audio.  I ave no complaints in these departments.

The only extra is a 15-minute ""making of"" featurette, and while it is supposedly HD, it looks SD.

I wouldn't recommend this as a purchase, even to diehard Phantom musical fans.  You might like to just catch it if it shows up on Netflix or the like, but I can't guarantee you will want to see it all the way through.

4986900,1,B006GHA9VQ,"Okay, so I hate sequels on their very premise of existing, but I am a HUGE POTO fan, so I tried VERY hard to go at this with an open mind.  Epic fail.  I can tolerate what they did to Christine and MAYBE even to the Phantom (but seriously, Coney Island?  I'm an American and I still think that's dumb...which is saying a lot).  I cannot tolerate what he did to Meg, but the worst is what they did to the hero. This show butchers the role of Rauol, who's reduced to a drunkard and gambler (and I'm sorry, but after watching Hadley Fraser perfect that role, can anyone honestly see Rauol falling that far? Honestly??).  No way does he lose Christine to the Phantom in a bet, oh, spoiler I guess, but if you're still thinking about watching this crap, you deserve it.  No way, NO WAY, does Meg shoot Christine...ooops, spoiler again...seriously, don't watch this.  You'll hate yourself for wasting the 2.5 hours you could have spent watching netflix's 25 Anniversary POTO from Royal Albert Hall.

Is it all bad...fine, to be fair there is one good song, and lucky for you, it's RIGHT AWAY AT THE BEGINNING.  The Phantom's opening song.  Once you've watched it, you can turn it off.  Seriously.  Turn it off.  It's the only thing that's redeeming about the film, and that's not saying much.

Andrew: you didn't have my permission to truncate the show for Phantom Spectacular in Las Vegas (which is what they used eventually to make the film version--and again, props to Rauol for being AWESOME in that one too).  Anyway, you shouldn't have cut out critical scenes/songs for that and you CERTAINLY shouldn't have done a sequel.  It was a bad idea, a very VERY bad idea.  It's an insult to Gaston Lareoux, an insult to Sarah Brightman, a catastrophic insult to Steve Barton and Maria Bjornson, and a slap in the face of every POTO fan out there.

4986903,2,B006GHA9VQ,"I write plainly, not fancy theater talk. :)

Why hasn't anyone brought up that ALW is now recycling music? It is probably inevitable after such a long career that some melodies are reused/reminiscent of others, but to recycle an entire melody for the title song is beyond disappointing. Check out ""Our kind of love"" and ""Love never dies"". Some bits of the songs (can't remember track title right now, think it was Meg singing) remind me strongly of the woman in white.

Like all ALW productions this one is still better with better tracks than many others. However it is not a 5 star production by any stretch of the imagination.

The Phantom in this Australian production is all hardness, Christine has a soaring voice and looks like a porcelain doll. She also acts like an expressionless doll. I would have liked to see Remin and Sierra playing their parts because they may be the best Phantom/Christine ever. I'm sorry but the Australian ones just lack chemistry (in addition to acting, ugh).

Madam Giry was like Snow White's stepmother, and Meg was all nice and then suddenly turned nasty. Raoul became a loser, and ""It's beautiful"" is plain horrible without the haunting sounds of ""Past the point of no return"". If it's not a nice melody, just stop using it. I would rather ALW recycled some other nice melodies instead of using this.

I think the little boy Gustov could be the best performer of the Aussie production.

This production needs a lot of work and new soundtracks before it can make it to broadway...and please, Sierra and Remin!

4986905,4,B006GHA9VQ,"But I'm happy to see the story continued.
I've seen people here scoffing at the idea that Christine could ever have been happy to engage in...carnal relations with the Phantom, and that she was effectively date raped.
One of Erik's lines in Beneath a Moonless Sky is ""You found the place where I hid"". I think the idea is that she came back and found him, sometime between the events in PTO and her marriage to Raoul. I also think the writers were a bit too subtle on that point.
It's not the original.  But in some ways, the characters are deeper. Raoul undergoes more character development in Act 1 than he does in the entirety of PTO. Christine has a spine, relatively, anyway.  I think it's nice to see more of  Mme. and Mlle. Giry, though I wish they weren't deranged. However, Mme. Giry's anger at being cast off is kinda understandable. But I guess every story needs a villan and neither Raoul nor the Phantom can fill that role.
Some of the sets were spectacular.  I understand this production has been reworked since the London opening. I, like many others, am firmly on the Karimloo/Boggess train, and would love to hear them sing it, but I thought the actors in this production were solid, though Christine was a bit shrill from time to time.

4986907,5,B006GHA9VQ,"First of all, The Phantom Of The Opera doesn't NEED a sequel. It's perfect the way it is ended, in a mix of tragedy and love. I've always rooted for Erik (the phantom) but in all seriousness, the part that makes me love POTO so much is the fact that he ISN'T with Christine. That's what makes me cry every time I watch the 25th anniversary performance. This is NOT a true sequel. I don't think Raoul would have become a gambling drunk, I think he would have loved and taken care of Christine to the best of his ability. And that whole thing with Meg and Madame Giry? Those were NOT the same characters I know. This show also does not have the ambiance of the original Phantom. It's brighter, flashier, and much less mysterious.

 Now bear in mind, I very much enjoyed Love Never Dies. It is a great ALTERNATIVE ENDING, just as Susan Kay's Phantom had a great alternative ending. The music was good, I loved Gustave's singing parts, and the showgirl-esque tunes from Meg were interesting. I also found the Phantom's henchman delightfully creepy, even if their singing voices were not all that great. I did enjoy The Beauty Underneath, although it is certainly not a very ""Phantom"" sounding song. Devil Take The Hindmost was very good as well. Overall the music wasn't very ""opera"" at all.

Incredible cast. But the music seems to be same old, same old, no sense of novelty or invention. The only two pieces that were truly amazing is the opening scene - the Phantom solo and the theme title song - Love Never Dies. This is actually the climax everything leads to. After that there is nothing to anticipate any more.

The plot is absolutely lame. It in many ways feels like Mamma Mia - a musical, where the creators had to add some kind of subject line, however corny, to pull together brilliant pieces of music. Well, just like I said - there is not much music brilliancy in Love Never Dies and the plot is totally worthless. Besides, it robs the original musical of its meaning if you take this new creation as a sequel. Some people say that one should't view it this way, but then why did not the authors simply make a musical about another Phantom at another place rather than including old familiar characters into the story line making good people villains and so on. I am not sure.

I believe it is the actual production - that is so well done - that made the show a success Down Under. All the money poured into it, the overwhelming costumes and scenery would not leave anyone unimpressed if seen live.

Well, I might be the only one so disappointed that I even had to fast forward through some boring and monotonous music pieces. But there is this opinion, and I am the official collector of this DVD. So I guess this opinion has the right to exist. So maybe it will be helpful for some hesitant buyers.

In any event, except for ""Devil Take the Hindmost"" the music wasn't all that good, and I liked neither the plot nor the ending.

Most of the characters from the Original Phantom are in this musical. They have the same names but do not carry the emotions nor any relationships with each other as seen in the original Phantom.
I had a hard time trying to resolve the complete changes in their character. Their changes can somewhat be understood if you try. Christine is the key to these changes.

Watch it once to start down the road to enjoying it. By the forth viewing you just might really enjoy it.

If you are expecting it to be what the original Phantom was...forget it...",1349049600,,996,4.511111111111111
4986915,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I had not seen any clips nor heard any songs before buying this dvd, though I had read the original book on which the basic story was based ('The Phantom of Manhattan' by Frederick Forsyth).  So I really had no idea what to expect but I bought it because 1) I'm a POTO fan and 2) Andrew Lloyd Webber.

In short - this is a tremendous show.  Buy it immediately.

I disagree with those reviewers that say the music is nothing special.  I love the music (and have bought the cd).  Several songs in particular stand out: 'The Beauty Underneath' (a visual feast and a wonderful song sung by the Phantom and Christine's son, Gustav), 'Devil Take the Hindmost' (Raoul and a spectacularly sinister Phantom), and 'Love Never Dies' (Christine's signature song which always brings tears to my eyes).  Don't take me wrong - I don't think there's a bad song in the entire show, these are just my favorites.

I could go on and on but I won't bore you.  Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind.",1348876800,,987,4.4088397790055245

4986917,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I thought this stage production, filmed in Australia was wonderful. The vocalists, the sets and the colour excels!
My only comment that having been filmed live, the camera angles were not always accurate and in the darker scenes the blacks were a little on the grey side. There was also some distractive light wandering into the black bands at the top and bottom of my 16:9 screen. The soundtrack deserves merit.
I thoroughly recommend this blu-ray disc.",1348444800,,454,4.909090909090909
4986918,5,B006GHA9VQ,Great quality. I have problems or complaints with this product. It's an awesome continuation of the story that I think everyone should watch at least once.,1348272000,,155,5.0
4986919,5,B006GHA9VQ,"First a couple of notes to those who have never seen this production on DVD.  The characters do not all have moles on their foreheads, but microphones.  If seen live, I don't think the microphones could have been seen at all.  I just ignore them just like I ignore the concert style mics used in the Royal Albert Hall, 25th Anniversary production.  Also, there are many discrepancies in time line and in character and even in plot from the live production and the movie.  I am as willing to suspend disbelief for this production just as I did for the book, the old movies and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fantastic play.
It is not quite as good as the original Phantom.  The music is as beautiful, but the lyrics are not  as good as the the original Lloyd Webber Phantom.  Every once in a while, the lyrics jar a bit.

***Spoiler below***
However, I have read the lyrics to the original Love Never Dies, and this is a great improvement and not just in lyrics.  From what I can tell from reading those lyrics, the original play had a catastrophically bad ending.  Thank goodness the folks in Australia did quite a bit of ""cleaning up.""  I am not happy with the current ending, but at least I can use my imagination and change it.
Mr. Lewis who plays the Phantom is a bit melodramatic in his acting, more like the acting in an opera which, like everything else, is subordinate to the voice of the singer.

All of the above being said, this is a wonderful musical and a wonderful production.  I wish I could have seen it in Australia to get a much better vision of the working of the sets which I found very impressive.  The singing was magnificent and the music was as good as any by LLoyd Webber (and certainly better than JC Superstar).  Mr. Lewis has a wonderful baritone which I have always preferred to tenor anyway.  Ms O'Bryne has a beautiful voice also.  Her makeup is a bit heavy, but probably not for a theater and she is as beautiful as the Phantom thinks she is.  Maria Mercedes has a wonderful (if short) solo which shows she can belt them out as well as any Broadway legend.

I was not happy with it when I first saw it, but since then it has become an addiction and I watch it almost every day - and it gets better each time I watch it.  Ben Lewis is very good looking as the Phantom (with his mask on) and not as bad as the orignal Phantom, but worse than Gerard Butler in the movie, with it off.  You have to be able to stop the DVD at just the right spot to see him.

Whatever it's flaws this Andrew Lloyd Webber step child is a beautiful work with soaring music and singing.  It also has a very sexy duo between the Phantom and Christine that is more explicit than Past the Point of No Return.

Anyway, I now love it as much as the original Phantom which I have in three versions:  the movie, the Royal Albert Hall 25th anniversary production and the original cast album.  But this Phantom is a very calculating and dangerous man, but still more worthy of Christine than the other two.  He is less hot headed and a little more sane than the previous Phantoms.",1348012800,2,3069,4.30890052356021

4986921,5,B006GHA9VQ,"This stunningly beautiful sequel to The Phantom of the Opera is amazing. I usually do not like recordings of live productions because it takes away the spectator's freedom to look at a particular part of the scene. However, even though the camera focuses on what it wants the spectator to see, the story does not change, and it is a truly touching one. The same characters are back with the addition of Gustave, Christine's son. The mystery of who his father is brings to light all kinds of secrets- the most important one being the never dying love that the Phantom still has for Christine and her struggle to realize that she might have made the wrong decision ten years ago.

I hope someone makes this humble opinion reach the eyes of ALW.
I was surprised when I, at the extras, saw ALW talking about this musical.
WTF is that? - Even the music is not original.
The main music belongs to another musical - THE HEART IS SLOW TO LEARN.
I wasted the money, the time - but that's not the most important:
ALW, I was disappointed with you. You didn't need to do that. Really.

Man, do you need the money? If so, please re-run other musicals.
Question: How possible Christine be in love with the Phantom? And more than that, they have a son???
Did the Phantom raped Christine and she enjoyed?

Can we assume there is will the sequel to this musical - perhaps with the same score of Evita??? - I like Evita.

Now to the person willing to buy this blu-ray: - Simply DON'T. Keep loving the ALW you know. Don't taint your admiration for him.",1347580800,2,889,4.337349397590361
4986923,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I am a HUGE fan of the Phantom of the Opera (POTO) so I really wanted to love ""Love Never Dies"" (LND), the sequal to POTO.  It is a beautiful play without any comparison to POTO.  In a comparison, it still falls short of POTO.  However, since it's cheap to rent/buy this DVD, I still recommend it.

REASONS TO SEE LND - 1) The Phantom, Christine and Raoul are more ""human"" in LND.  They show more emotions so the audience can relate to them more on a personal level.  Each one of them is flawed but I still wanted all of them to be happy. The Phantom is no longer a cold Angel of Music but a feeling human being who shows his vulnerable side and fights to get back his Christine.  There is more dimension to this Raoul and I was very touched by his parting note to his wife.  Christine is very conflicted between the 2 men who love her.  Each actor portrays these characters perfectly.  2) The child actor who plays Christine's son Gustav adds to the play.  He is pint-sized but what a great voice!  3) The set is beautiful.  Many scenes remind me of Cirque du Soleil.  I was wowed by the crystal obelisks that contain live actors who are dressed up as oddities - a mermaid, a shaman, a 4 legged man, etc.  What eye candy!

REASONS I STILL LOVE POTO MORE - 1) The songs in LND never strike a chord with me the way the songs in POTO did.  There is no iconic ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""Music of the Night"", ""All I Ask of You"", or ""Masquerade"" songs.  The only two songs that are somewhat memorable are ""Devil takes the Hindmost"" and the song that the Phantom composed for Christine for her last performance (I assume it's called ""Love Never Dies"").  However, they still do not compare to any of the above songs in POTO in the music or the lyrics. 2) It's not necessarily a bad thing but the costumes in LND is so much more modern that it is hard to believe only 10 years had passed between the two plays.  It seems like a whole century had passed.

I think the key reason why LND did not do well in England and Australia is that POTO is still playing and thus it overshadows LND.  When given a choice between the well-established POTO and the newbie LND, most probably went for POTO.  I bet LND would have done MUCH better if POTO were no longer playing.",1347580800,,2250,4.217798594847775
4986924,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I've been looking forward to seeing 'Love Never Dies' for years. I finally got the chance to see it because of this DVD. I was not very amused with this Australian production. The Phantom's (Ben Lewis) voice is sometimes weaker than preferred, and Christine's (Anna O'Byrne) voice is often shriekingly annoying. However, the young son Gustave's (Jack Lyall) voice is surprisingly beautiful and it stands out. I also didn't find the sets that impressive. After watching it, I felt the songs were overall weak - far below the bar set by the original 'The Phantom of the Opera'. The great big song at the end, 'Love Never Dies', sounded like it should be a happy ballad, but O'Byrne just made me feel sad. Overall, I was quite disappointed. Later, I scoured the internet for other versions of the songs. I discovered that Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess starred in the very first showings of the musical in London in 2010. There are a few bits from that performance available on YouTube. The most of a song you can find is the opening song by the Phantom, ""'Til I Hear You Sing"", and it is so much more moving when sung by Karimloo than when sung by Lewis.

As for the story, this too is a little weak. At the end of POTO, Christine goes with Raoul instead of the Phantom, and the Phantom professes his love for Christine. In POTO, Raoul comes off as a real prince-charming-type. In 'Love Never Dies', which takes place ten years later, Raoul has become a gambling drunk. He's put his family in debt and apparently makes demands on Christine to sing wherever he chooses. She has become a world-famous singer, and he knows he can milk it. In short, Raoul has become the villain. They travel to Coney Island after they receive an invitation to sing at Phantasma, a Coney Island amusement park. They have no idea the Phantom is behind the invite. This soon changes, and the story becomes if Christine will choose Raoul or the Phantom. I think the story would have been much better if new characters were introduced. The only new character is the young boy, Gustave. Other than that, the cast is the Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Meg Giry, and Madame Giry. There are a few silly cirus-types who have a few lines, but they don't come into the plot. The story just really needed to be more fleshed-out. It felt very basic. There just needed to be more.",1347408000,2,2342,4.5894988066825775

The Phantom flees to Coney Island to start up a circus/freak-show after the events in Paris.  Madame Giry and her daughter Meg follow him.  Meg becomes a burlesque dancer and obsessed with the Phantom.  Madame Giry wants to hook them up.  Christine, Raul and their son get drawn to Cony Island to open a new opera house, but the Phantom convinces Christine to sing at his show instead.  Raul is now a mean, gambling drunk and Christine is now in love with the Phantom, who has changed from the pitiful, screwed-up, dangerous Genius of the original musical to someone who plays by the rules and is mild, self-sacrificing, and likes clowns and bad Carnival music.  Oh, and by the way, it is revealed that Christine slept with him the night before her wedding and Gustave is actually the Phantoms son!  Everything about this musical is SO, SO BAD.

4986930,2,B006GHA9VQ,"I wanted to love this show.  I was genuinely intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Phantom of the Opera, but that's what the show should have remained: an idea, and nothing more, because the show itself is a disaster.  Sure, the music is alright, the acting is decent, but it's utterly impossible to overlook the plot holes in this production.  There's just too many parts that simply don't add up.  Raoul as a drunk?  The paternity of Christine's child?  The questionable mental health of Meg Giry?  I realize that over time, people change... but the drastic, melodramatic changes we see in the characters from Phantom in Love Never Dies are just too much to believe.

I'm giving LND two stars simply because the costuming and set design are quite well done, so if you'd like to watch a show that knows how to dress its characters and place them in attractive sets, then this is the show to watch.  Beyond that, there's not much else going for this show.

My advice:  rather than spending your cash on Love Never Dies, purchase the 25th anniversary Phantom of the Opera celebration filmed at the Royal Albert Hall, starring Ramin Karimloo, Hadley Fraser, and Sierra Boggess.  You'll get beautiful costumes, gorgeous set design, incredible talents, AND a show without glaring plot/characterization issues.

4986940,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I have become aware recently that there is a well organized group of POTO fanatics who have made it their mission to sabotage LND and have been active since the play first opened in London. Apparently they feel it is sacriligious to touch Phantom in any way. Thank heaven there was no such group of fanatics of the book or we may never have seen ALW's Phantom because he certainly took many liberties with the book and in my mind if he decides to extend his Phantom, then why not? It's his to work with. I first saw a snippet of LND on PBS and became so intrigued I bought the DVD sight unseen -- I have not regretted it. If you are a fan of musical theater, you must see this, it is fantastic. There has been much written about the weak story line and I admit it is very soap operaish, but, look at Phantom. I mean, really, how plausible is it that a man could live under the opera house, menacing and threatening the opera company AND killing people and nobody does anything about it? Forget the weak story, what makes LND (and POTO) great is the music. ALW has written a marvelous score that leaves you humming and wanting to hear more. The DVD of the Australian production is beautifully filmed and the sound, at least on the blu-ray is impeccable. Everyone involved in this production has done a wonderful job from the director down to the set and costume designer, the music director, and the cast.

The music and set design have been so completely revamped since the Ramin/Sierra London show (which, although underwhelming visually, is preferable vocally to the Australian cast with the exception of the Giry's) that the lushness and spectacle so treasured in the original comes back full force. I saw it in theatres and was blown away by the dervish of colors, the post-London lyrical adjustments  la Charles Hart, and the character revisions that metamorphosed the Phantom back into his menacing/blackmailing personage.

The new production's book almost revolves more around the artistry, the craft, and the importance of music in Christine and the Phantom's lives than the seduction clung to in the original. Their relationship has matured such that music's mutual hold over them is the basis of their union, as well as the reason Raoul is so incomprehensive regarding Christine's psyche.

So yes, the story is a tad watered down, but take LND for what it is, not what people delusionally supposed it would be: a good musical.",1343865600,2,1331,5.152777777777778
4986950,2,B006GHA9VQ,"On its own, this is an OK musical.  It isn't something I would stand in line for hours for to get tickets as is its predecessor.  There are some great haunting melodies, but where Phantom was a departure from a ""typical"" Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical, Love Never Dies stays right in the center of the mix.

I understand why, on paper, having the Phantom go to Coney Island would be an interesting setting, but after watching this, and then going back and watching Phatom, it truly cheapens the entire story and its characters.  I found it predictable and boring.  I think it would have been much more interesting to increase focus on the child, and let the side stories (Meg, her mother, drunken Raoul, and even Christine)take a back seat or even eliminate them.

It has moments of promise, but much more let-down and the finale was a mess.  Throughout, there was too much exposition which led to over explaining the obvious.

If you are a huge fan of the original, you will be disappointed.  This really is a story that was better left to our imaginations, and untold.

Video quality was great, and I thought that this Australian cast would have been MUCH better suited for the 25 Year Anniversary concert.  This Christine sounded like Sarah Brightman, and this Phantom, sounded remarkably close to the mighty Michael Crawford.",1343865600,5,1326,4.771929824561403

4986953,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I have been a moderate fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, but have particular favorites, as I'm sure most people do. Love Phantom, kinda can't get into Cats, couldn't stand Jeeves. I suppose it has to do with the way Webber bounces between major and minor keys more than anything else.

However, to the point.

Love Never Dies is a sequel to a story that really can't have one. I'll explain that momentarily, but speaking of just the elements of the show other than the story, the production values are first rate, the orchestrations are lovely and, in general, the score is somewhat uneven. It might have been a mistake to open the show with undoubtedly the strongest number, ""Til I Hear You Sing, Once More"". It is this show's ""Music of the Night"" and very hard to top, especially if much of the rest of the score is a light, almost lilting collection of motifs in minor keys and odd timing. Nothing much really grabs at the emotions.

But none of that is the real reason this show never had much of a chance, regardless of the value of the various elements.

The reason this could never work or measure up to the original story is that it was mythic, culturally iconic. It is, in short an archtype. The reason no one has ever successfully written a sequel is that there is literally no story to tell. The Phantom is rendered resolved as a character at the end of the first story. There is nothing left of him worth observing.

Think of it as an archtype, a basic story that strikes at something human inside all of us, not just something that suits our personal tastes. Christine is an archtype. She represents Innocense and Purity, not just sexually, but also artistically. Raul is also an archtype, representing Brave and Noble Manhood. As an archtype story, it is inevitable they will wind up together, regardless of anything else that occurs. That is the moral, cultural, archtypal lesson: Brave and Noble Manhood deserves the prize of Innocense. In this respect, and in the way they are presented in the original Phantom show, they are rather flat, one dimensional characters, precisly because they are archtypes.

The Phantom, on the other hand, is the one everyone associates with, emotionally, because it is his tragedy that contains elements with which we all identify. He has his deep obsessive love for his own work, which can only become true ""art"", at least for him, when sung by Christine. So he faces the dilemma of what exactly he is passionate about: the female or just the mechanism of her voice.

At the end of the story he has to decide what has any true value, his own creations or human life, in the person of Raul. And we can even see the moment when he finally has his ephiphany that, between his own work and Christine being regarded as an actual person, one that does not share his dream and would be hurt badly if forced to share it, he realizes that reality is more important, and all his life's work is meaningless in comparison. Only then does he truly fall helplessly in love with Christine as herself, not just hte perfect voice. And makes the ultimate sacrifice for her, giving up his reason to exist. It's no wonder that he vanishes at the close of the story. Not to set up a possible sequel, but precisely because his story is told and he is, from this point onwards, nothing.

The actual story of Love Never Dies is a valient attempt, but it can never rise above the purity and sharp emotional impart of Phantom, and yet will always be compared to it to its detriment.

Indeed, all it can ever do is deminish the characters. In this case, Noble and Brave Raul has become pretty much a selfish jerk who gambled away all their money. Christine has now become a rather lackluster matron with not all that much to do but endure her husband's irresponsibility with stoic dignity and fuss over their ten year old son. And the change to the Phantom almost borders on the pathetic. Now he is a whiny, obsessed stalker who, when he finally reveals himself to her gets shot down rather embarrassingly. He becomes utterly powerless, unable to instill awe of any kind. In fact his interaction with Christine's son is like watching the devil bouncing a toddler on his knee and cooing over it. The image is a little bit of self-parody that can't be escaped in order to assemble the rather mundane ""who really hired Christine?"" story nonsense.

Personally I don't think there exists a follow-up story for the character of the Phantom that could ever add anything to the character or even capture the pure impact of that first tale. It says it all. Anything else would be overkill.

Still, as done here, it is very skillful overkill. You can put it on in the background to have the tunes going. Works quite well for that.",1343433600,10,4744,4.575971731448763
4986954,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I think that Andrew Lloyd Webber adapted ""Love Never Dies"" from a book ""The Phantom of New York"" by Fredrick Forseyth...We picked up the book ten years or so in an off the wall bookstore in San Diego and enjoyed it very much...It is a  continuation of Webber's ""Phantom of The Opera"" in New York City...I'm not sure the mucical ever hit Broadway, but know that it did well in London's West End...Never heard much more about it but it appeared on PBS in May 2012 and we watched and enjoyed it as well....Did not know that a CD and DVD was availible until the PBS showing....It is a good experience for Phantom fans who wonder what became of him after the Opera House in Paris....We were pleased to find it availible at Amazon....JJJ",1343347200,2,731,4.455223880597015
4986955,2,B006GHA9VQ,"I remember when I first saw the movie, The Phantom of the Opera, after reading the Leroux novel. I was completely satisfied until the end when The Phantom does not die of heartache like in the novel, but has to suffer the pain of losing Christine. This ending, of course, was one of the reasons Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to make a sequel. When I watched this Love Never Dies movie, I thought that The Phantom and Raoul had totally switched personalities. It was so strange. Nothing was much of a surprise to me until the very ending. Andrew Lloyd Webber made a worst ending than the first. I didn't feel the same message that the original musical was trying to give us. The 2 things I actually enjoyed was the music and the visuals. I don't think this DVD is worth buying. I believe you should rent this movie, if you're dying to see it.",1343260800,9,839,4.384615384615385

4986957,1,B006GHA9VQ,"I was so utterly disappointed in this ""sequel"". I had high expectations for it, considering Andrew Lloyd Webber's name was on it. The Phantom of the Opera brought chills to my bones and the music stayed in my head even when I went to sleep. The character depth was so astounding. At the end of it, despite the Phantom's madness, I was rooting for him. Which is the reason I was so excited for this sequel.

""Love Never Dies"" didn't start off too good, which left me a little uneasy with how the movie was going to progress. I didn't like how it was basically just a stage production. The music was kind of tacky, especially with the scenes with her son Gustave and her husband Raoul. The only good piece of music that I actually enjoyed was ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"", and that basically summed up the Phantom and Christine's relationship. IT was catchy and the music was fantastic, so I will give credit for that.

I watched the movie with my grandmother. She regretted buying the disc. We were tempted to just stop watching entirely, but decided to see if it got any better. It didn't.

I think my expectations were far too high for this movie and the reviews were misleading. I did not enjoy this one bit. *SPOILER ALERT:* At the end, I basically wanted to break the disc in half because Christine DIES. If I were Andrew Lloyd Webber, I would've been embarrassed to have allowed this to be sold, especially after such a great success.",1343001600,5,1435,4.490421455938697

But, as one who has read/watched/listened to so many different adaptations of the Phantom story over the years, I have to say that I truly loved this. I did also read the book this was adapted from, and was not very impressed, but Andrew Lloyd Webber has once again worked his magic. Some people had issues with the setting...Coney Island, others had issues with the music or the acting, or the fact that Raoul is not portrayed as the ""knight in shining armor"". But if you go into this expecting it to be  a continuation of the Phantom era of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, then you may very well be disappointed. It is another story entirely, one that I think works well. I loved the music, the actors were superb, and the story haunted me long after the last music note ended. Now I must go out and buy the music CD so that I can properly aggravate my husband and teenagers by listening to it and signing refrains from it until they want to pull out all their hair, they would expect nothing less.

4986973,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I read the reviews before purchasing the blu-ray and watching it.  I remember reading to ""keep an open mind.""  I was, and am, pretty opinionated on the events of the first musical.  My only solice for the first part is that it was kind of an opera.  After watching the second part, I am not sure why I should keep an open mind.  I am not sure, even now, what I thought of the ending.  What I can say, is that the story was excelent.

I went into the musical thinking how can Andrew Lloyd Webber top the music from the first part.  The Phantom of the Opera has melodies that are beyond words.  That explains the huge success of the first part.  Sadly, the music, IMHO, of the second part, is not so good.  it is okay, but it is not as rememberable and outstanding as the first one.  The glimpses that he gave to the earlier melodies made me smile, but that was a bad thing.  If watching the musical, I yearn for the old melodies instead of being swept away by the new ones, then the musical was lacking in the music department, which is what Mr. Webber did.  The title song was very good, though.

I wonder if this second part will catch on the way that the first one did.  Seems the answer is no, but the musical is new, so we shall see.  I almost did not even realize that there was a sequel.  I went to see a movie at AMC, and in the slides prior to the commencement of the previews, I saw a quick slide for a limited engagement for The Phantom of the Opera and the sequel Love Never Dies.  I went to fanthom.com and realized that, wow, there is a sequel, so I purchased the video.

The story is good, but I am disappointed that the melody was not superior to the ones introduced in the first part.  Oh yes, the part that I disliked the most was at the opening when they had the carnival at Coney Island.  Those melodies and songs are IMHO forgettable.  I could not wait for that part to end.  Maybe on subsuent listenings I will like it.  To be fair, the first part had Masquerade starting the second act.  That one is growing on me, but it is still my least favorite.

The video is definitely well worth watching and a MUST WATCH if you were left hanging from the first.  Mr. Webber said that the first one was left with a cliff hanger of sorts.  I would not have phrased it that way, but the story did not finish.

I reduced the rating to 4, because of the music and the Coney Island part at the opening.  The rest of the production made up for the lacking parts, so hence a 4.

Will there be a #3?  The story did not really finish with the sequel either.",1342051200,,2560,4.107070707070707

4986976,5,B006GHA9VQ,"This review is for Phantom fans who aren't sure about the sequel. Yes, ""Love Never Dies"" wasn't very well-loved when it opened, but that's because it is unique and has a sad ending. When I heard about the story, I initially refused to see it because I'd heard Meg and Raoul, for example, both ""go bad."" I didn't want anything changing my mind about how Phantom is ""supposed to end."" But then I heard the music. Just listen to Ramin Karimloo singing 'Till I Hear You Sing"" on YouTube, and you'll recognize Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom. That song is incredible, like others in the show. There are even some phrases and melodies (but not too many) from ""The Phantom of the Opera"" incorporated into the sequel, and it's fun to try to recognize them. After listening to the soundtrack a friend had bought, I was convinced it was good. Seeing the video was so fun because the music came alive in the story. It really isn't that bad. Raoul is a bit tense the whole time, and Meg does things you wish she hadn't. But Phantom and Christine haven't changed at all. Christine is still beautiful and sweet and gentle, and Phantom, though less blood-thirsty, will do anything to woo Christine back to him. The climax in the story is when Christine must choose to sing or not, each of her lovers trying to pull her different ways, and she is once again caught in a hard decision. Overall, this movie was well done. The story is a bit changed from the soundtrack version, but I think it's clearer, and the cast (in my opinion) is not as good. Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo (original cast) are simply amazing. So I'd suggest listening to the soundtrack first and the music will probably convince you to see the movie, as it did me. :)",1341878400,,1723,4.507987220447284

I never hated the idea of a sequel and I'm glad I kept an open mind about it. I do love the differences between the London and Australian version. Ben Lewis' deep voice was breathtaking, Anna O'Byrne's Christine was mature and believable and her Opera training came in handy, Simon Gleeson was excellent as Raoul, and I loved this version of Raoul better than the London one. The Phantom had some of his old characteristics that made him the Phantom, Ben's Baritone voice was simply beautiful.

The lyrics were so horrible they sound like a first-grader writing a nursery rhyme. The ""new"" melodies are a rip off of other musicals.

Besides lack of development, why did Meg look like Annie Potts? Why does Madame Giry look like Patti LuPone? Why does Christine look so Irish?

4987003,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I have watched ""Love Never Dies"" several times since buying the DVD and just finished reading quite a few of the reviews on Amazon.  Not surprisingly people seem to love or hate it but then one usually needs a strong opinion to be motivated to take the trouble of a review.  I would like to add a few thoughts of my own.

I wonder if many people grasp that ""Phantom of the Opera"" is at its heart the story of the love of and sometimes obsession for music that most classical composers and performers possess.  ""Love Never Dies"" is simply a continuation of this story line.  For all its faults, in this it is successful.  The transfer of the characters may be less so.

A number of reviewers have made much of the fact that the Phantom in ""Phantom of the Opera"" has declared himself denied the sins of the flesh and therefore would be unable to father children. I think it is reasonable to assume that he is simply referring to the repulsion that women would feel to his appearance not to some physical inability.  In fact, the use of a baritone voice makes the Phantom in ""Love Never Dies"" even more of a masculine, testosterone driven creature fully capable of being a passionate lover.  The one part of the continuation of the story that does not work though is that in ""Phantom of the Opera"" he was made a two time murderer.  I ran into a theatre goer recently who never noticed the bodies hanging from the rafters.  Perhaps the author wishes that to be the case for all of us. That Christine would love a murderer or that he would be worth loving just does not work.

In ""Phantom of the Opera"", I found Raul nothing but a rich, reckless, self-important jerk so I can easily go with his now being a gambler and a drunk.  He treated Christian as so much arm candy, not believing her story of the Phantom, refusing to respect her fear of performing the Phantom's opera and never appreciating her talent or what it took. He does not acknowledge that like her father, a supposedly famous Swedish folk violinist, she too had real God given talent. So now in ""Love Never Dies"" the man has a wife whose musical passion he has denied and who lives with a secret about their son that she can never share.  Psychologically abandoned, Christine simply pours her love into her son.  I found the young actor who plays the son to be delightful even if his signature melody was a bit weird for a child.  He really succeeds in pulling together the under story of a father and son's love for one another. As for Madame Giry and Meg, it is not much of a stretch to see that they would assist and follow the Phantom.  But to Coney Island?

I think Lloyd Webber says that at the turn of the century Coney Island was considered the eighth wonder of the world and that Freud said it was the only reason to visit American.  Hard to see this today and my big criticism of the cinema photography is that with their emphasis on close-ups of the principals, one cannot appreciate the stage setting that might place you there.  As for the stage settings themselves, they are in my opinion a bit too art deco in their lushness.  I certainly did not immediately get that what appeared to be a giant mirror in the hotel room was in fact supposed to be French doors leading to a balcony.  But otherwise they are wonderful in concept, color and lighting with the exception of a Christine all in blue against a too blue background singing the title song.

Webber feels this is one of his better scores.  That it is good is without question.  Listen to it a few times and the tunes will be humming in your head.  I would like to see Hart polish up the lyrics a bit more.  I think the title song especially needs more works and needs to be sung by an operatic caliber soprano.  In fact I would like to hear most of it sung with operatic quality voices.  Along with other reviewers, my favorite was ""Until I Hear You Sing Once More'.  Rather a shame it is the opening song as it sets the bar too high for the rest.  I hope ""Love Never Dies"" does make it to a New York stage.",1339804800,44,4040,4.332446808510638
4987004,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I confess to being spoiled by such greats as Michael Crawford (not to mention all time favorite Colm Wilkinson) in the original Phantom productions and audio CD set.  I have also watched the Emmy Rossom movie version many times.  I was looking forward to the sequel of Phantom, but had not listened to the soundtrack or read much about it before I purchased this dvd.

So.  The production was spectacular.  The music themes, the sets, amazing.  I wish it had been more of a ""movie version"" as opposed to a live theatre version (with applause) because that was distracting.  Having said that, if they had to do a recorded theatre production, why couldn't they have done one in, for example, London?  With more ""known"" actors?  I did not know anyone in this production, did not particularly care for the singing, and by the way, in my opinion, the Meg character completely stole the show.  She was lovely, and incredibly enjoyable to watch and listen to.

Well, I am not complaining, not trying to tred on any Australian toes :-).  If you liked Phantom of the Opera, chances are great that you will also enjoy watching this dvd!",1339545600,3,1126,4.659898477157361
4987005,3,B006GHA9VQ,"First and foremost, I don't truly believe there could ever be a successful sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. Andrew Lloyd Webber set the bar so high the first time, it's very hard to meet or exceed the expectations in a sequel.

The set is beautiful, the costumes and performances are striking and dramatic. By many measures, this is a good show. My biggest problem with Love Never Dies is that the characters have changed too much to be believable.

The Phantom has gone soft. He killed, controlled, manipulated, stalked, and terrorized people before. Now we're supposed to believe he's this sentimental softie who makes bargains with Raoul? I don't think so. And speaking of Raoul, who is this lazy, unsupportive drunk? I didn't even recognize his character this time around. I didn't find Christine likable at all and didn't even feel any real sympathy for her character. I guess the only character I did connect with was the child, Gustave, and even he could have been developed more.

I realize this takes place 10 years later and people can certainly change. But for the sake of consistency, protagonists and antagonists should not change drastically in the second installment. At least not at first. If their personality changes or evolves throughout the story, that's expected. But opening up a show with characters who are new versions of themselves is usually a bad idea. This makes it more difficult for the audience to identify (and re-identify) with the characters they've known before.

There are treats throughout the show that give a subtle nod to Phantom fans. Musical notes and lyrics have been borrowed from the first one to give a sense of familiarity to this one. It's somewhat fun to go through and identify them. You'll find yourself saying, ""Oh, I recognize that song! It samples such-and-such.""

Other than a general sense of familiarity, most of the songs are forgotten as soon as the show is over. The only one I've found stuck in my head was ""The Beauty Underneath,"" which really stood out to me. It was dark and powerful while reminiscent of the original Phantom theme.

If you're a fan of Phantom, you must see this. You may not love it, but how could you not want to see what happens next?

As far as sequels go, I really think Andrew Lloyd Webber did the best any one could do. Like I said, the first one is hard to top and I don't think it ever could be topped. So this is about as good as it gets, and even better than I'd expected! Bravo for that.",1339545600,4,2484,4.644646924829157

It truly actually made me depressed by watching it lol. It kinda reminded  me of a dark, dark version of Moulin Rouge.  Never the less, it's worth watching. Would I purchase it and watch it over And over? No.",1339459200,5,374,4.3768115942028984
4987007,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Look, I won't go into what this beautiful musical is about since others have already said plenty . My biggest issue with some other reviewers, NOT all, is that too many are stuck on the original ""Phantom of the Opera"". POTO is wonderful but I don't consider any one musical to be a masterpiece. As a matter of fact, I judge them each on its own merits and some I like more than others. Personally, I like ""Love Never Dies"" better than ""Phantom of the Opera"". It would profit others to be more open-minded to the musical.

  Furthermore, I am thoroughly impatient with snobs who are very nit picky and demand that events more closely resemble the original Gaston Leroux book. Grow up,already! So the sequel has nothing to do with Leroux's book but is based on ""Phantom of Manhattan"" which I never did read just the original. Just for your information, a sequel DOES NOT mean it should be a continuation of the same plot line. Sequels are meant to move the story along. So, LND takes place in America on Coney Island which is a place with which I am familiar. In the early 1900s it would be a perfect place to hide anonymously among people whom society deemed misfits and not fit to socialize among the rest of the population. Besides, Andrew LLoyd Webber mentioned in an interview that he always considered POTO to be a cliffhanger and he always wanted to do a follow-up musical for the past 20 years.

  Also, some have issues with how the characters have changed from the original. Well, if anyone went through a traumatic experience such as the fire at the Opera Populaire then people
do change for the better or the worse. Some become weaker, some stronger depending how deeply those individuals are affected. Christine, Erik, Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry would not be the same people as before the fire. As for the continuation of the date line and other minor points not making sense to others I say: yada, yada, yada! The Australian version was reworked and for those who DO possess an imagination pretend that there is no continuation flow. I did and it works great! Again, that falls under nit picky, nit picky, nit picky! Please DO grow up!

  Lastly, to each his own. If you've given this musical piece a chance and still don't like it, well, that's that. Nobody will like everything someone else does.

The author is a man of great talent and does not seem to realize that a one song musical just doesn't make it.  This failure is further degraded by an attempt to
follow up on the Phantom legacy.  If you are a fan of Phantom don't see this dribble.

4987009,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I'm giving this DVD a four star review despite finding the musical itself to be poorly written, ill conceived and just about wrong on every level.  I do this because from the direction of photography, to the costume and set design, to the performances, all involved really gave it their best and it shows. I think that is worth something.  The sets are really whimsical and spellbinding (despite not looking a thing like the Coney Island they are supposed to represent) and the music is exquisitely played and sung despite being tonally inconsistent, anachronistic,lacking in subtlety or nuance and even (at times) cribbed from everyone between Puccini to... old fashioned klezmer music.  This last part should come as no surprise though, considering the original Phantom is much the same.

Ultimately, the show's biggest failing is in its inability to illustrate Love (capital L) of any kind.  Hinging on the unsubstantiated notion that Christine Daae was ever more than the Phantom's hostage in (for want of a better phrase, Part One), the story of Love Never Dies presupposes that she actually loved him and even insinuates that during the eighteen minutes she was his captive, they made sweet sweet love.  But does so in such a horrific way that every character finds that line between love sick and creepy/stalker and blows right through it.

I  buy that through some heightened, 80s-rock-musical version of Stockholm Syndrome Christine could love her captor even though it's not at all supported in the text.  But when that same guy says to her ""a man as hideous as me is capable of anything...""  well, that's just layers and layers of neurosis on both sides that at best leaves me completely disinterested and at worst makes me want to find something sharp and stick it in my eye.

Ultimately though, it should not go unsaid that within this entire clown car of a script and score there is in fact ONE truly amazing moment where music, lyrics and drama all come together in a way that is not cheesy, unearned, overly clever or untrue to its characters.  And it's really quite satisfying to watch.  Which, if you consider how many mega-musicals can't even claim just one, is fairly remarkable.",1339286400,5,2199,4.879032258064516
4987010,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I was pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be much more entertaining than I expected.  Coney Island 1903 - what a great setting.  Nothing on earth could ever compare to Phantom, but this stands on it's own. The characters seem realistic considering the time-lapse.  The set design and costumes are so dazzling - I'd be surprised if they didn't get complaints from the Orchestra. It enveloped me into it's world.  The music was passionately melodic with wonderful lyrics containing universal ideas on love and life.  So much like Phantom, but with a different kind of darkness.  So much regret and longing.  I was enthralled with all my essense viewing this on Blu-ray.  The  first few songs were gorgeous and hooked me right in.  I kept waiting for it to fail and just when I thought it would, it soared!  The only thing that upsets me is that I wasn't aware of this great production to have seen it in the theatre.  I can't wait to familiarize myself with the songs.  I know over time I will grow to love it more.  Sir Andrew Loyd Webber made NO MISTAKE in taking such a risk.  It works and hopefully at some point pays off. I couldn't help but imagine Baz Lurhman reconstructing this project into a movie.  It has so many qualities I imagine he could build on.

Yes it's different than Phantom, as other reviewers have mentioned, and it's supposed to be. Superb casting of the Phantom, Christine and Meg in particular; and the young man who plays Gustav was excellent as well. I see a bright career ahead for this young man!  For me personally those were the standout performances in this production, but that isn't meant to detract from all other casting.  Musically you will hear overtones of Phantom of the Opera, but the original score from Love Never Dies by Andrew Lloyd Webber is fabulous - soul wrenching at times, eerie in some numbers, humorously entertaining in others.  As for the staging and costumes, I was very impressed also.  The final scene was definitely unexpected and a tear jerker for me.  Definitely a must own for Phans!  If you have the opportunity to see it on the big screen at special screenings in select movie theaters, definitely go, it's even more impressive!",1338854400,5,1078,4.820652173913044
4987012,4,B006GHA9VQ,"Where to begin?  I saw the LON production on its closing night, and where most fans cried (some weeped) at the end of the musical, I found myself lamenting as well--but not for the characters' fates.  Rather, I found myself sending a short text message to my Phantom phriends & phamily: ""Love SHOULD have died.""  The performances were incredible, with Ramin being 1 of only two Phantom's in my life--the other being, the untouchable Michael Crawford--but the sets were amateur-looking & ALW's dependence on video imagery was appalling.  I felt like if I was watching ALW's infamous phrase  when describing Phantom, ""rock opera"", on MTV with some fine voices thrown in there. The sets I could forgive when the singing started, but I could not tolerate the constant use of videos.  if I wnated to see videos, I could have watched played on the computer.  Phantom's deserved MUCH more than what seemed to be a hastily put together production with no cohesion.  As aforementioned, the cast was incredible--they really were too good for that somewhat scary production.

Enter LND--the DVD.  I was NOT expecting anything good from this purchase, but being a Phanatic, I had to give it to the benefit of MY doubt.  From its start, I could just smell the proper production & vision.  Songs were rearranged with less dialogue, and voila:  here is Love Never Dies as it should have been directed and produced ALL along.  The cast was ok, with only Anna O'Byrne standing out.  I would have LOVED for the original cast to have stepped in for this production.  The actresses chosen for Madame Giry and Meg were less than mediocre in their roles.  I clearly remember Summer Strallen becoming a bonafide sensation in HER performance as Meg in the West End production.  Ben Lewis may be the perfect physical size for Phantom, but he doesn't have the star quality, vocal chops, or presence as RK or MC.

One thing is for certain:  you get the full full spectrum of worst (Mercedes as Giry, that horror as Meg) to somewhat bearable (Lewis as Phantom) to excellent (the remaining cast and O'Byrne as Christine).",1338854400,4,2092,4.790502793296089
4987013,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I just finished watching Love Never Dies, and it is a spectacular production. I was excited from the second I heard that it was being shown in theaters (albeit for a limited time), but I was disappointed when I realised I couldn't go see it. So, one of my relatives was kind enough to pre-order it for me on DVD.

In spite of what Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber said, I think it's absolutely vital to see The Phantom Of The Opera (the stage show AND the 2004 film version) before viewing Love Never Dies, as the original is referenced several times throughout Love Never Dies, in dialogue, music and song. Some songs even sound like the musical equivalents of several songs from The Phantom Of The Opera (I don't mean that as a put-down in any way; merely an observation on a brilliant choice of music and lyrics by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and Glenn Slater).

The story is absolutely gripping. Plenty of drama, story, spectacle and show-stopping songs in the vein of The Phantom Of The Opera. A job bloody well-done.

My favourite songs from this production are Til I Hear You Sing, Look With Your Heart, Beneath A Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, The Beauty Underneath, Devil Take The Hindmost and Love Never Dies. However, every song is top-notch. Well-written sequel. I highly recommend it.

Surrender to the pull of The Beauty Underneath, and find that Love Never Dies.",1338768000,6,1371,4.652892561983471
4987014,1,B006GHA9VQ,"Where to start, where to start? OK, the beginning.

Like a lot of Phantom fans, I was nervously expectant when I heard that ALW was fashioning a sequal to Phantom of the Opera. Now let me say that I am not a fan of musicals per se. The ONE exception was Phantom, which I fell in love with and saw several times. From the special effects, to the performances of Michael Crawford and his successors, to the wonderfully realized re-telling of the compelling tale, I thought it was a flawless theatrical experience. A good sequal would have been wonderful, but outside of The Godfather, sequals have a spotty history at best. Still...one could hope.

My first red flag came when I heard that Love Never Dies was to be set in Coney Island. Coney Island? Novelty acts and roller coasters? For my Phantom? WHAT??? How does one go from the Paris Opera House to Coney freakin' Island? OK, deep breath. It can still work, right?

Wrong.

Almost everything about Love Never Dies falls flat. First fatal flaw; the Phantom has a pedestrian entrance. Its so pedestrian its basically a non-entrance. Using suspenseful anticipation is a key to great art; Hitchcock was the master, and ALW used it beauitifully in Phantom. Where was the Phantom? Is he watching us now? When will he return? No such element in LND. Although disappointed by this beginning, the opening number itself is wonderful and Phantom-worthy.

Second red flag however, occurs during the Phantom's first number and is the Phantom himself. If ""story"" is primary, as ALW contends in interviews, how did the Phantom get younger in the intervening 10 years? Indeed, age is a problem with the entire cast. As the story unfolds, Madam Geary is the same age as when we last saw her in Paris, Meg is the same age without having matured emotionally at all, Raoul is the same age, Christine is the same age.

As for Raoul, he has been reduced to having become a degenerate gambler and drinker. The only interesting thing about him is that he and Christine have managed to have a son, Gustav. Gustav is...wait...wait...10 YEARS OLD. Of course, story being everything for ALW, Gustav COULDN'T be the Phantom's son because we learned in the original that his disfigurement also prevented him from partaking in the ""Joys of the flesh."" That little detail apparently has been forgotten/tossed aside/ignored so that we now understand who little Gustav's real father is. This is not so much a red flag as it is a king sized red sheet.

The rest of the play's progression reads like a Lifetime Movie. Like mother like son, son is revolted by the Phantom's appearance, but learns to look beyond it. Raoul and the Phantom have a confrontation in a seedy bar. ( This was the funniest scene in the play. I half expected Raoul to break a beer bottle in half and tell the Phantom he was gonna cut him.) Christine's fate is sealed by an errant gunshot.

The opening number and The Beauty Underneath are wonderful. Outside of those, the music is utterly forgettable. The sets pale in comparison, magic and execution to the original. The voices of the players are all quite wonderful and appropriate. The acting is well, um, acting. The Phantom here does not have enough nuance and is far too broad. Raoul is cartoonish, but that may owe as much to the book as to the actor. Christine is portrayed ably, but just so. Gustav's sense of wonderment is a little too much, Madam G has become Norma Desmond and Meg needs lithium more than any character who's trod the boards.

As for the other reviews on Amazon, I have to say I was totally shocked to see the number of 5 star reviews. Either ALW has a lot of relatives working the site, or there are a lot of people out there with very low standards who had a poor grasp of the original Phantom plotline and production.

The biggest challenge after watching this poorly fleshed out affair will come when The Phantom next comes to town. When I attend a performance, I'll have to pretend the sequal never happened.",1338768000,34,3983,4.652916073968705

4987018,2,B006GHA9VQ,"Spoilers ahead.

I was so looking forward to the sequel for The Phantom of the Opera - Love Never Dies, which only ran in London and Melbourne for a limited time. I've seen all of the movie productions of The Phantom of the Opera and on Broadway a few times. I preordered the sequel and read the 4-5 star reviews, some proclaiming it to be Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score ever, and I was excited to see the continuation of the story that has enchanted millions. My daughter and I watched it on the heels of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall (2012) with Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine, which was a beautiful production.

Then we began the highly anticipated sequel. The opening was promising, with the Phantom's belching of ""Til I Hear You Sing,"" although even at that point I was not too convinced with the actual performance from Ben Lewis. The rest of the musical was comical, even hilarious at points. The storyline is horrible. There are musical remnants from the original score that remind us it's supposed to be Phantom and Christine Daae, but the casting is all wrong and warps the characters as we knew them. All beautiful technical singers, but they do not embody the spirit of the original story.

The setting is in Coney Isle (Island) ten years later. It lends from a ""Cirque du Soleil"" feel due to the context. The Phantom (played stiffly by Lewis) is sanitized in this performance, and loses his mysterious and magical appeal. The Phantom, Madame Giry (Maria Mercedes) and Meg Giry (Sharon Millerchip) are established in the freakish heart of the oddities and curiosities of the place. The Phantom laments the decade without his muse, and is able to entice, under guise, Christine (Anna O'Byrne) and her family with an invitation to journey to America to perform at the theater Phantasma.

Christine is visually striking enough, but she is a lot more bland and I did not feel her character develop much throughout the story. I could not relate to her at all or felt sorry on her ultimate demise. Raul (Simon Gleeson, whose performance was ok) is a drunk and gambler, losing all his fortunes, and ignores his 10 year old kid, Gustave - a son that is actually fathered by the Phantom with Christine, unbeknownst to Raul. I liked Raul, especially in the 2004 edition of the movie, despite his somewhat selfishness to put Christine at risk in order to draw the Phantom out to capture/kill him, but this story completely destroys it. His gambling is the reason why his wife must now be the breadwinner and conveniently take the assignment in Coney Island. Raul makes a bet with the Phantom on whether Christine will sing, finds out that he has been fathering a bastard child that is not his, loses the bet and is supposed to leave Coney Island broke and without his Christine.

Meg Giry looks like Madonna minus her mole from the Material Girl days, and tries too hard vocally to be the ""Ooh La La"" girl. She and her mom, Madame Giry (whose voice is dry as sawdust) vie for the Phantom's affections. She becomes deranged when he doesn't show up after one of her best performances on stage, and then kidnaps the Phantom and Christine's love child in a rage against the Phantom for overlooking her talents. Since when did the Phantom care about Meg? She realizes that it's always been about her bff Christine, and ends up ""accidentally"" shooting Christine instead of herself or the Phantom, as she threatened.
Gustave looks like any ordinary early 1900's young chap, nothing like his true dad, but inheriting his musical abilities and ""hearing sounds in his head."" The kid will grow up messed up - not only does he witness his mother's childhood friend shoot his mother, but his mom reveals that his dad is the Phantom on her last breath. He runs off blindly looking for his fake dad, screaming Nooo!!! for the second time in the musical (first time when he saw the Phantom's face). The ending scene has the two men and the boy surrounding the already dead Christine, some awkward transition from the Phantom holding her to Raul holding her, and then the boy taking off the Phantom's mask, petting the mutated side of the face as the Phantom sings about love never dying.

My daughter had to shut it off half way because the singing was literally giving her a huge headache. I forced myself to watch the whole thing. I really tried to like this, but it was huge disappointment. I had very mixed feelings about the Phantom and Christine having a love child in the first place. Maybe it would have been different if Karimloo and Boggess played the parts, or if I did not associate it with the original masterpiece.

The production tries too hard to hypnotize through beautiful sets and gorgeous costuming, but fails with annoying and lackluster melodies. The story about the Phantom has always been about love at its core, but this is a tacky rendition of what was a heart-wrenching emotional and captivating storyline. No doubt I may offend hard-core Webber lovers who are able to overlook these glaring failures, but I cannot...

Andrew Lloyd Webber, who was your muse for this? You have lost your craft, and no wonder it did not make it to Broadway. New Yorkers would have clamored for their money back.

4987019,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I always say that I am going to start reviewing items on Amazon more often... So here goes!

Allow me to preface by saying that I generally cannot tolerate the stage production of musicals, nor theater!  Oh and I have given them so many attempts to earn my appreciation.  They usually irritate me more than entertain me.  I will note that I do enjoy Opera and most of the productions I have seen.

My first introduction to the ""Phantom of the Opera"" was the CD after hearing a version of ""Music of the Night"" when I was 18 in 1992 and loving it.... I have seen the stage production several times, the traveling group when in Dallas, and usually left disappointed because I always thought that Christine's performance and reactions were a contradiction to the music and lyrics. I never liked Christine.  Not even Sarah Brightman when I saw the performance on TV.  Also, I did not see the charisma and suaveness that the Phantom possessed in the book.  I always listened to my CD and imagined the two, Christine and the Phantom, performances based just on that composition...  Isolating the music and lyrics from the visual...  Only the 2004 movie did come the closest to what my imagination always produced...  but that is another review, altogether.  This is for ""Love Never Dies""!

""Love Never Dies""..... WOW!  What can I say about it?

Ben Lewis.... I believe he nailed the Phantom!  That suave charisma that the Phantom was known for, with the underlying insecurities and madness.... He was excellent!

Anne O'Byrne.... Awesome Christine!  You can see the internal conflict regarding her love for the Phantom.... And in the book, Christine did love the Phantom.  Leroux wrote it as a serial gothic mystery and tragic romance.  Although, it sold poorly and not really that great of a book, only one of the most amazing characters!

The production value of LND?  Well, it entertained me more than it irritated me!  I cannot wait to see this one day on the stage.  I would love to be in the first few rows during ""The Beauty Underneath"" and ""Beneath a Moonless Sky""...  The visual aspects of the filming of this stage production are beautiful!

Fleck, Gangle and Squelch?  I wanted to see more of them!!!!!  They were so entertaining....

The storyline?  I thought it was good.  I have known of the book on which it is somewhat based, ""The Phantom in Manhattan"", and never really had an interest in reading it.  I do believe that Meg is not the antagonist in the novel... BUT, I always thought that Webber always portrayed Madame Giry as obsessive... and a little CRAZY!!!  So, I can see the parallel in her passing that obsession onto Meg.
I still gave this 5 stars because I think everyone who is a Phantom fan should give this a chance... But really it is 4  stars... Wished Webber would have stuck to the timeline.  I mean... he had an active role in the 2004 movie... AND I think he used that as his vehicle to re-characterize the Phantom and Christine, especially their relationship.... So why did he not utilize it?  You know he has had LND in mind for a decade, at least!

It does give those of us who always wanted Christine to acknowledge her love for the Phantom some closure... haha!",1338595200,,3195,4.6310160427807485
4987020,2,B006GHA9VQ,"Pros,
Beautiful production, great sound, love the music, perfect floating, well directed, Kristine great voice, Phantom voice-acceptable,

Cons, Very week story, not believable, should have been not related to the first Phantom at all. It destroyed the whole concept. That's why I had to block the first story out of my head completely, in order to enjoy the sequel. The acting was to mechanical for me. The best actors were Meg and the kid. Kristine was to young for her role she did not have any experience, in being a mother, wife and a lover. Phantom himself was to stiff and he is so far from Michael Crawford, like me to Michael Baryshnikov. I must have watched the first Phantom 5 times, 3 times with Crawford, and each time I watched I had chills in my spine. Even watching the movie, I had to wipe my eyes a few times. LND did not do anything for me, except a nice music. Some of the melodies repeat themselves over and over again Did ALW run out of the notes? He should have borrowed from Frank Wildhorn, he has a lot of them in his head. The ending of the story is absolutely stupid, and did not make any sense for me, besides it contradicts the original story. Kristina, who does she really love, besides her dresses? The story should have had a happy ending one, when Kristine helps the Phantom to be recognized as one of the best composers by beautifully performing his ballads. People could see the beauty in his music that would over shine his distorted face.

I can go on and on about cons, but I will stop right there, because over all its pretty good show, just do not compare with the first one, if you do you will be disappointed.",1338595200,6,1651,4.427631578947368

I waited several days before viewing ""Love Never Dies"". After seeing ""The Phantom of the Opera"" on stage so many times over the years, it actually became a part of my life. Then, (sooner than I might have wished!), the 25th Anniversary re-staging at Albert Hall in London triumphantly proved that ""Phantom"" could push the limit and be even more perfect. It floored me with its subtle changes in orchestrations and characterizations, which gave new emphasis to everything I already knew, yet still surprised me. The cast was huge, the settings and lighting were stunning. I only mention the 25th Anniversary re-work because it really ought to be experienced before moving on to ""Love Never Dies"".
While the original play had all the right ingredients for a mesmerizing theatrical experience, ""Love Never Dies"", because of its ""newness"" has its own surprises, mysteries, shocks, comedy and a visually hypnotic world of beauty. It gives us a deeper, darker, convoluted look at the Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Gustave (their son), Mdm. Giry and Meg Giry...ten years after the Paris Opera House fire and the mysterious disappearance of a heartbroken Phantom. I really don't want to divulge any plot elements, because it's a whole new story. I will say that the music and lyrics vie for the splendorous sound of the original. Andew Lloyd Webber does something truly wonderful by sprinkling melodies and a few lyrics from ""Phantom I"" among the new score. It has an extremely comforting effect, because we are still emotionally connected, though all that unfolds on stage is its own legitimate entity.
From the elite Paris Opera House to the glitzy world of turn-of-the-century Cony Island? It works splendidly, just as the underground lake took our breath away in ""Phantom I"". The whole atmosphere is near circus-like...a circus with a constant tug of war on our emotions. The second half of the show is definitely full of midnight secrets, heart-pounding suspense and looks into the souls of those characters we think we already know. Not so!
""Love Never Dies"" is definitely a light-framed roller coaster ride of plunges into nightmare and ascensions into glory. Order it today and experience something really great!",1338508800,3,2401,5.471698113207547
4987022,4,B006GHA9VQ,"Years ago, when rumors surfaced that Andrew Lloyd Webber was working on a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, I was both excited and appalled:  Excited because I'm a huge fan of the original show and would love to see and hear more material on the subject - and appalled because I couldn't imagine the possibility of a well-conceived idea for a sequel.  To move forward with a sequel - at least in my mind - there has to be more to the original story, and it has to be an intriguing story.  A good story.

Whether you believe the story of Love Never Dies is a good one or not, I think it's at least. . . interesting.  The Phantom of the Opera was certainly interesting.  It's basically a ""beauty and the beast"" type of story told using spectacular scenery and lush, melodramatic music.  Andrew Lloyd Webber struck gold in more ways than one with that show.  Love Never Dies has the exact same formula except that there's a twist in the story, albeit a far-fetched one.  Just because some may perceive a story line to be implausible doesn't mean it's a bad idea.  I mean how likely is it that a horribly disfigured man came to be such a genius, such a musician, such an architect, such a magician?  Is it feasible that he'd live years and years across an underground lake underneath the Paris Opera House and haunt the place without ever being caught?  If you loved the original story, then I'm assuming you buy in to these ideas.  Why not?  After all, it's fiction.  Right?

The continuing story that the Phantom escaped from Paris and discovers the fortune and anonymity he enjoys at Coney Island is completely plausible to me.  Same goes for the reason that lures Christine to New York 10 years later.  What has happened with Christine and Raoul's relationship in the interim isn't all that far-fetched either.  The twist in the story involving the only new primary character of Gustave is a bit hard to swallow but definitely not impossible.  If you understand that conception took place just before the Phantom left Paris (and not sometime during the original story, which I find ludicrous that some reviews seem to think that that's when it occurred), then you have to know that the story line is possible.  I don't understand how some people can watch and listen to ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"" and not understand this.  I totally understand why a person might be skeptical about the likelihood of the circumstances, but again it's fiction.  Right?

For the very reason that many people say the show doesn't work or for which the story is so often criticized, I believe the show wouldn't work without it.  The above-mentioned twist is what makes the story interesting.  I think it's the hook that makes the viewer want to see how the story is going to play out.  Add in the battle of the Phantom and Raoul vying to win Christine one last time, and the story becomes perhaps even more intriguing than the original story.  I'll admit I had trouble buying the whole story, but I found myself genuinely interested in seeing it all unfold, even if parts are completely predictable.  Realizing that the new story is pure fantasy, just like the original story, I enjoyed it a lot.

I don't blame Andrew Lloyd Webber one bit for attempting what he's done here.  I absolutely don't believe that he has done what others have suggested - that he simply saw an opportunity to make some cash.  He attempted to strike gold again but not necessarily for fortune.  Rather, to be inspired to write new music for a subject that's near and dear to him.  Sure, he may have borrowed a melody or two he had previously written for something else to incorporate into the new score, but there is plenty of really terrific original stuff here.  Combine all of it with just the right amount of familiar tunes from The Phantom of the Opera, and the score to Love Never Dies is one of Webber's best ever.

The production values are second to none.  From the actors on stage and the musicians in the orchestra pit to the crew handling the sets, costumes and lighting, all are tremendous.  The picture and sound quality on the Blu-Ray are stellar.  I think Love Never Dies is a great show, and the disk is worth every penny to have as part of my collection.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because the show was filmed and put together on disk more like a movie than a live stage show.  I would have preferred to hear all of the audience reactions and to see all of the scene transitions.  You do hear some audience reactions, maybe only three or four times throughout the entire show.  When I see a show in person, I enjoy witnessing and imagining all of the technical and creative details that must go into changing from one scene to another and making everything flow seamlessly.  You get very little taste of that on the filmed version of this show.  It's obvious in many places that the producers cut out audience applause and footage during transitions from scene to scene.  Still, it's a beautifully shot and edited show.  The only reason I could fathom for the decision to produce the DVD in this way is that it made me, at least, want to see the show live (if it ever comes to the U.S.) more than I might have wanted to see it had the DVD given me more of a feeling of actually seeing it live.  If the show ever does tour the U.S. or perhaps go to Broadway, I will likely make every effort to see it.",1338508800,5,5400,4.479017400204708

4987028,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I have been waiting a long time for the Love Never Dies DVD to come out. Because I live in the United States, I had to wait a little longer than Australia and the United Kingdom. All I can say is, well worth the wait!

When I first heard of an idea for a ""Phantom of the Opera"" sequel, I was a bit surprised and confused, asking myself, ""How can they make a sequel to this? What's it gonna be about?"" Then I heard the original London cast soundtrack and immediately fell in love with the music and songs. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are the greatest Phantom and Christine EVER. EVER. So, I was a bit disappointed when they decided to release the movie from the Australian production and not from the London show, which I very much would have preferred. However, I can honestly say I was not at all disappointed by this show. The sets were amazing (Yes, better than the London show sets, I'll admit) and the cast was very comparable to the London cast. Anna O'Byrne plays a strong, independent Christine right from the beginning, and it was interesting to see Ben Lewis give the Phantom a more deep, baritone voice than the traditional high tenor voice that most actors have given the Phantom. The singing and acting were phenomenal. I just think that Lewis' voice sounded too tight and constrained at some points, almost like he was trying too hard to hit a note (especially in the opening ""Till I Hear You Sing"" sequence). And the creepy eye thing he was doing throughout the show- what was that? He was pulling a Sarah Brightman, I thought. However, aside from those two flaws, he did a highly exceptional job playing the Phantom.

The rest of the cast was top-notch. I would have liked to see the regular human-sized Fleck instead of her being a midget, though. I think the London version of Fleck worked better than a midget. And while I would like to see a full-length feature movie at some point with perhaps Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum once again, I have a feeling that this is the closest we will ever get of a ""Love Never Dies"" movie. Somehow, even with the revised, improved Australia show, I still think that not many people are very fond of a sequel to arguably the greatest musical ever written. Because of this, I'm afraid that Lloyd Webber might cut this show entirely and act as if it never happened. I hope not, though- I loved this! It was fantastic and incredibly moved. At the end, I even got a little teary-eyed. I don't care what the haters and critics say. Andrew Lloyd Webber has struck gold twice and created a quality sequel to ""The Phantom of the Opera."" The setting in Coney Island was pure genius because the Phantom can really relate to all the freaks and oddities living there when they have nowhere else to go. Plus, the Phantom has some background at being displayed, and living, in fairs and travelling circuses, as mentioned in the original ""Phantom."" The clever references to the original show also blend very well in the show. So seriously, I highly recommend this to anybody who is a fan of ""The Phantom of the Opera."" PLEASE! Don't let the critics and haters influence you. Take a look at this for yourself and keep an open mind, and I promise you you will love this!",1338336000,5,3214,4.501712328767123

This is the 1st time Phantom's been sequeled, with Robert Englund's Phantom sequel dying in pre-production in the early 90's. I am disappointed to the point of depression after viewing this sequel to Webbers stage version (NOT movie version). Love Never Dies makes the basic error in sequelling that should be avoided - it changes history. The history change made is that now instead of a Phantom that denied himself ""the joys of the flesh"", we have one that had a one night stand with Christine which produced their son!?!? Love Never Dies then goes on to have the classic, traditional Madame Giry, choreograph a strip tease number starring her daughter Meg!?!? She then tries to match the Phantom (who's her age) with her daughter Meg!?!? We also get a Meg that's now infactuated with the Phantom!? A Christine that leaves her drunken bumbling husband Raul for the Phantom!? Musical numbers that aren't even mediocre, & a final end to the debacle with Christine accidentally killed by Meg!!!!

4987031,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I reeeely wanted to like this performance. I must admit I only found it mildly entertaining. The script stretches every which way with no obvious justification or direction. In this follow up to ""Phantom of the Opera"", Raoul and Christine find themselves in New York AND mostly in Coney Island - yes, Coney Island. The Phantom has taken up residence there with a freak show and seems to have brought the two lovers (now married and packing a ten year old son) to New York under the pretense of Christine's appearing for the impresario, Oscar Hammerstein I. Without getting into the plot; there isn't much of one here - the performers must be given their due, making much of the nothing they've been given to speak. They have even less to sing; there is only one memorable song in the entire performance; ""Love Never Dies"" - which had it's initial incarnation in a number sung by Kiri Te Kanawa ""The Heart Is Slow To Learn"". I think the better choice would have been to stick to the original lyric. Those offered in this performance have little meaning and are slightly repetitious.
The most disappointing aspect of this blu-ray is the minimal, flat, crammed audio - it has no depth, width or dynamic range. You'll be hard pressed to hear the difference in quality or stereo imaging between the 5.1 and 2.0 audio choices. Switch back and forth - you'll see what I mean. So, this long awaited sequel (by me) to the classic Phantom musical falls flat in my estimation and joins the embarrassing company of the ""Les Miz"" concert at Albert Hall for reeeeely crappy audio. The lack of expertise in some of the concert blu-rays and the annual Tony Awards leads me to wonder where all the capable audio people have gone. Is there something in Vegas; a convention or continuing product show? There can be no excuse for poor, sub-standard audio in this day and given the current paradigm. Even more confusing is the fact that both Lloyd-Webber and Cameron Mackintosh gave the ""go"" to releasing their material with inferior audio!
In closing, this production is an eye full! The set design by designer Gabriela Tylesov is a knockout. It has a Tim Burton feel and look to it; alive with color and imagination. The lighting and staging are similarly fantastic and enjoyable. While this Blu-ray is an eye-full, it's sadly short of an ear full. Kudos to the director, designer, costumer and lighting designer. The audio guys responsible for the film mix (not to be confused with the house sound) should give back their pay checks for this debacle.",1338249600,8,2532,4.71783295711061

I have a room full of Phantom of the Opera memorabilia, so you can understand when this movie was available for pre-order I jumped on the bandwagon.  Well, the DVD arrived this afternoon and within 10 minutes it was in the DVD player.  I was already familiar with the music as I have purchased the soundtrack, but I was breathless watching the production.  I waited so long for a sequel to this love story and was not disappointed. I am so curious and dumbfounded as to why it did not do well in London.  I had read The Phantom of Manhattan and the story is based upon it; I thought the production was done very well.  It is hard to fit a whole book into a little over two hours, but it was portrayed quite well.  I am so happy to finally have the opportunity to see this show.  Very well done and I highly recommend.",1338249600,,873,4.154761904761905
4987033,1,B006GHA9VQ,"In 2010 I had the privilege of seeing Love Never Dies on stage in London, with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  IT WAS 10x BETTER.  In the australian version: 1) the phantom was not well: yes this man can sing well, but his voice is too baritone to be the phantom, the phantom should have a voice in between tenor and bass since the music has high and low notes.  2) christine sings well and the actress herself is very pretty, but all that make up and that wig make her look like an evil queen.  3) THE PHANTOM HAS NO SCAR! What! Why are they cutting corners?!?! You never see the scar and its not there!  4) I hate their version of The Beauty Underneath.  Not only do they change the music, but the set is made up the most stupid, weird things I've ever seen. 4-armed people in glass cases? Little aliens chasing a T-Rex skeleton? In what world would anyone especially the phantom like that?!?!?!?  5) in the scene after that, the phantom goes into some sort of 'pit of despair', but i won't ruin why, it was WAAAY over done.  6) the phantom should not have a giant picture of christine in his room. Seriously, too creepy.
I don't like the plot of the show in either version if you've seen it, you know why.  The music is quite beautiful, especially Til I Hear You Sing, but only if sung by Ramin Karimloo.  It's a pity the show is no longer in London, but believe me, it was much better there.  If you want a taste of that amazing cast I would suggest watching the Phantom Of The Opera 25th Anniversary at the Prince Albert Theater.  It has the same cast that performed in the first Love Never Dies.  I would also suggest buying the originally Love Never Dies CD, to hear a good version of the music.
I do appreciate that the Australians produced this musical, but feel it could be improved if casting, make up, and set design were better and more towards the original Phantom Of The Opera.
To anyone who reads this please note I am not bad mouthing any of the actors since I know it is not their fault.  All I can say blame-wise that Andrew Lloyd Webber should have gone to oversee this, but again that is not his fault.

4987035,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I had the chance to catch LND in a local movie theater the other night as it was playing for one night only.  Being a big Phantom fan, I thought I'd give it a try.  And while this show does not hold a candle to POTO, on its own I think it holds up rather well.  It has all the hallmarks of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical - if someone were to play a random song from it, I could pretty easily guess the composer was ALW without any hints.

The basic story line is that 10 years after POTO has ended, Phantom has moved to Coney Island (naturally) and started his own show there that features Meg Giry with Madame Giry overseeing it.  Christine and Raoul are now married with a son, Gustave, who is 10.  Raoul is a real douchebag it turns out - an alcoholic and a gambler - and apparently not very good at basic math.  The couple is broke, and the Phantom manages to lure them to Coney Island with the promise of money if Christine will perform one time.  When they find out that their benefactor is the Phantom, well you can just imagine how everyone feels. The rest of the show basically deals with Christine being torn between two lovers (again) and also facing the fact that Gustave is actually the Phantom's son.  That's right, Raoul - it only takes one night. Ten years ago. Do the math!

I found parts of the story a bit contrived at times and there were a few points in the show where I actually had to muffle my laughter when things got a bit campy.  But on the flip side, there were some beautiful songs, especially ""Til I Hear You Sing"" and ""Devil Takes the Hindmost"" (whatever that means).  Also (and I realize this means I have way too much time on my hands), POTO took place in 1881.  LND takes place in 1907.  That's not 10 years later, but you just have to go with it.  As far as the cast, I thought they were stellar.  And I thought it was filmed beautifully.  You would have had a hard time noticing this was filmed on a theatrical stage and not a sound stage because it had such great camera angles and excellent lighting.

So rather than overanalyze it and try to compare it to POTO, it's probably best to judge it on its own merits, and that's why I give it 4 stars.  Great cast, beautiful music, and beautifully staged and filmed.",1337817600,3,2249,4.224824355971897
4987036,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I struggled to figure out how many stars to award this.  The book/story is awful, the characters are completely unlikeable (everyone is drunk or angry, or both, except for the kid, who's just confused), and much the music is forgettable, with the title track being among the most uninspired stuff I've heard in a while.  Normally, I'd give this production one star.

But.

The way this production came together, it was SO bad, it was fabulous, and for that, I'd give it five stars. So, averaging the one and five, you get the three.

Anyway, PatsFan's review from April 3rd is spot-on with all that is wrong with this production, but I choose to laugh rather than cry.  In fact, it was a struggle for me to contain myself when I saw it in the theater this past February.  As absurdly hilarious as I found many parts, I couldn't assume the few other patrons felt the same way, so I stifled my laughter, only to burst out in fits of it as I shopped in a supermarket after the show.  Good thing it was late at night with few other shoppers around.  (Apparently, a bunch of folks at a screening in NYC didn't restrain themselves and things got heated after the movie.  Go to the blog The Craptacular, do a search using the words Love Never Dies Crazy, and enjoy the post.)

The death scene was absolutely priceless and an excellent example of the horrible writing.

**SPOILER ALERT**

So, after the Phantom, apparently a better composer than psychologist,  fails in his attempt at hostage negotiation with Meg, Christine is shot by Meg.  Gustave, already traumatized by his mother being shot, finds out that the Phantom, of whom he is frightened and from whom he ran away screaming previously, is his real father.  Fabulous timing!

Then, Gustave runs off to find his ""father"" Raoul, who supposedly has taken off for Europe.  Did Gustave even know that Raoul had left and where he was going?  Come on, now.  Miraculously, Gustave finds Raoul and brings him back, just in time, to Christine's side, where, when Christine gasps her last breath, the Phantom cries, ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" eerily similar to that of Darth Vader in ""Revenge of the Sith"" when Padme dies.

Oh, I almost forgot - there was NO blood on Christine.  So she was lying there in her death throes, and there was no wound from the gunshot.

I did like Ben Lewis' voice, though.  It's deeper, darker and older in sound than Ramin Karimloo's and much more as I'd expect the Phantom's voice to sound.  I'd like to see Mr. Lewis in another production with a good plot and better direction.  I do like Ramin Karimloo and his Phantom interpretation from what I've seen of it, but the Phantom is not supposed to be a hot young dude; it takes away from the tragedy of the Phantom's life.  As fantastic as Ramin's voice is, its youth came through so clearly in anniversary performance and was a bit jarring for me, and as the Phantom in LND, he's supposed to be 10 years older than he was in the original show.

Bottom line, watch this without taking it too seriously and you might enjoy it, even if not in the way ALW would have wanted you to do so.",1337558400,4,3097,4.531531531531532
4987037,3,B006GHA9VQ,"I was very exited when I saw this blu ray for sale Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite musicals and I also love many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's works, I must say however that I am a little disappointed. Now some critics of this musical complain about the story but I think the story itself is fine. Most musicals do not really have that exiting stories, you see them for the music, take Cats for example is is basically about a bunch of cats having a party to determine which of them get to be reborn, there it is not so much going on but the music is awesome. Love Never Dies have a ok enough story for a musical, I actually got quite interested in it, and while it is just a basic love triangle story it is not bad. Basically what happens is that ten years after the end of Phantom of the Opera it is made clear that the Phantom survived, he Madame Giry and Meg have moved to New York and started a side show. In the meanwhile Christine have become a famous opera star but her marriage to Raul is in trouble as he has become a drunkard and have gambled away all of their money. Christine comes to New York to hold a concert to earn money for her husband and the story from there is rather predictable, but it works.

The problem with this musical is the music itself, it is boring. Now there are few songs, mostly people sing what they are saying in a conversation, the problem is when there is no rhyme that just end up sounding forced, of the actual songs there is few is memorable. In Phantom of the Opera there are so many great songs, and they are catchy to, you can listen to them once and be humming them in the shower for weeks. In this new musical the only two songs I can really remember is Love Never Dies and Devil Takes The Hindmost, all else just is a mass of music, yes it is pleasant, it is nice to listen to, but it says absolutely nothing and is for the most part bland.

Another problem I have with this musical is that everyone are A**holes. In Phantom of the Opera sure the Phantom was a villein but you could sympathize with him, this time around he is an obsessed idiot, Madame Giry and Meg do everything for him, Meg going so far as to prostitute herself so he could have the money to start his sideshow, and he toss them aside, he also threaten to kidnap Cristine's son. Raul who is the night in shining armor in the first musical is now a drunk, unpleasant fool which treat his wife and son as nothing, something which bothers be for off course it happens that the once night in shining armor turn out to be a jerk, however in a romantic story that sort of realism is not what you want to see. Meg Giry tries to kill a kid ad so on, I know I am mentioning some spoilers here but seriously why is all the characters portrayed this way. Now I love to see layered characters and even down right villains, but when everyone are jerks it get really hard to care for their fate in what is a love tragedy.

One thing I do like in this musical is the set, the Phantom's sideshow is wonderfully strange and Gothic, everything look beautiful. I also love the actors, they can both act and sing and they do an amazing job, the little boy has a bit to squeaky voice but all in all the cast is amazing. Another thing I do like is that they never show the Phantom's face. Now this is something that bothers me in most film and musical versions of The Phantom of the Opera, there is really no way to do the make up properly. The Phantom is supposed to be so ugly that he makes people faint, even die of fright, but when they show his face they usually have just made him have a few scars, perhaps some unseemly birth mark. Now I know a few people which scars on their faces and they do not make you faint in fright. By just showing people's reaction to seeking the Phantom without his mark they convey so much more about the horror of it than if they had shown his face with cheap makeup.

All in all Love Never Dies is pretty weak, the songs, the story and all of it can not hold a candle to Phantom of the Opera, when that is said the story is okey, the music, while bland is pleasant and there is a couple of good songs in there, the set is beautiful and the actors are good. If you really like musicals then this is worth a watch and I personally love that we get a continuation of the Phantom's story. If you are not a big musical fan however Love Never Dies will probably not change your mind for while it is okey it is far from great.",1336348800,,4459,4.110091743119266
4987038,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I am a massive Phantom of the Opera fan so it was only natural that I was a little scared when watching this musical for the first time, but I needn't have been it was fantastic. ALW has created the second musical with the same magical formula that the original did, only this time he has managed to include parts of the original that actually help this one. In various points in LND you hear notes or lines from POTO which underscore the story he is trying to tell without altering this story. this means that people who have not seen POTO can watch LND without needing the backstory, while those that have can get the extra layers that the music provides.
the actual recording of this musical is good, it focuses on the people singing or those using the fantastic sets. the only reason I have not given this musical 5 stars is because I  think they filmed the wrong one. Don't get me wrong I think that Ben Lewis is a great phantom but Ramin Karilroo (sorry about the spelling) is simply fabulous, if they wanted a movie version of this it should have been with him as the phantom.",1336003200,5,1083,4.361386138613861

But after watching interview with ALW and the London cast I realized how much respect they had for the first one. I mean the first one is Webber's baby! He must have had good intentions when writing this. I went on youtube and found a recording of the London cast with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess(love them both). I had such mixed feelings about it; gorgeous music? Check. Great acting? Check. Oddly great story line? Check...
After watching it again, I became obsessed!
How!? I hated the idea of it so much!

You have to go into it with an open mind my friends. I have found it to be a more ""what if?"" kind of story. Keep Phantom of the Opera, Phantom of the Opera. And keep Love Never Dies, Love Never Dies. Don't try to make them one.

As for the Aussie version. It's great! I prefer the voices of Ramin and Sierra, over Ben and Ana. But the over all staging of this one is much better. There are a few re-writes in this one I'm not as fond of; I preferred Meg coming back at the end rather than Raoul. I don't like the word re-writes in ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"" as much either. That's all personal opinion though.

Andrew Lloyd Webber has said that this might be one of his best scores. I'm a MAJOR Phan, and I truly believe that if you go into this with the right mind set you'll truly enjoy it.",1335916800,6,1480,4.200704225352113
4987040,5,B006GHA9VQ,"first off I must address one thing people seem to forget when talking about this story.

I have noticed that a lot of people complain that the phantom is not the same as he was in the first musical and that this is a form of character assassination.

well it's not! for one simple reason. it takes place 10 YEARS LATER! think about it, are you the exact same person in the exact same state of mind as you were 10 years ago? of course not! in those 10 years circumstances have occurred that caused you to grow, change, mature evolve! (whatever word you want to use!)

Anyway that aside. This is an absolutely gorgeous production! the score is both uplifting in some areas and haunting in others! my personal favorites are Christine's gorgeous aria, Love never dies (performed by the extraordinary Anna O'Byrne)and the beautiful yet longing Till I hear you sing by Ben Lewis who gives such an impressive performance as the Phantom. my final favorite is the rockish number the Beauty Underneath. yes it seems a tad out of place until you consider that it does work if you consider it a parallel to the duet Phantom of the Opera from the predecessor. (both songs are duets where the Phantom attempts to see if the other in question is receptive.)

the costumes are fascinating as well. but the standout is Christine's opera gown. I really enjoyed the detail in Christine's sapphire necklace and her peacock motif!

All in all this is a very enjoyable recording which captures much that is easy to miss in a live performance!",1335830400,5,1520,4.614814814814815

Like its predecessor, this is worthy of being staged by the world's great opera houses. The only difference between these shows and legitimate opera is the use of microphones. I don't want to give away too much plot, but if you've seen the film version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" this show contradicts the ending of the film--though not of the original stage version.",1335052800,3,521,4.612903225806452

LOVE NEVER DIES is a complex work that will challenge long-time fans of the original, but rewards those who approach it with an open mind. As for the music and performances, Ben Lewis' star making turn as the Phantom is a thing of wonder to behold, as he weaves a spell of obsession and melancholy, second only to Michael Crawford in this reviewer's opinion. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, bringing life to Lloyd Webber's best score since the original PHANTOM.

4987043,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I live in Tasmania and was in Melbourne when ""Love Never Dies"" was on, but unfortunately I could not afford the exorbitant prices they were asking for it, so I missed out. So I waited for the Blu-Ray to come out and having watched it was blown away. I saw the original Phantom in Australia, UK & Canada and thought it could not be bettered. I do not like sequels, as they tend to be extremely disappointing. Not so with LND.
It was worth the wait and I have the added bonus of having the best seat in the house.
I am not going to go into the meat of the show, as you will have to see it for yourselves.
But I can certainly recommend it to all. The cast are superb, as are the sets, costumes and lighting. When I see shows like this, it makes me proud to be an Aussie.
This is a work I will watch over and over again as there is not a dull section anywhere, the twist and turns make sure of that. Plus the Regent Theatre is the best venue to facilitate a show of this magnitude.
If you have Blu-ray, go for it as the image and sound (DTS) are beyond first rate.
I have been a fan of ALW since his first work and I am proud to say that I have everything he has ever written in my vast collection.

I loved the stage show of Phantom of the Opera - yet I thought that the dubbed, badly-lip-synched travesty that was the official DVD film version had sunk low; now, lo, there is a sequel. It is just a complete parody of the original - the score is dreary and repetitive, the lyrics are shocking and the acting is full of camera angle poses.
I find it so sad that a man who did produce and write some of the best stage shows has become so detached that he'd sell out his reputation so completely. The only other low point would be to write a Eurovision song contest entry ... !",1333756800,9,772,5.433333333333334

The music is excellent, as we've come to expect from the composer. The storyline is a bit of a let down, being essentially a re-hash of its predecessor.

4987046,1,B006GHA9VQ,"This is an abomination.  The story is absurd.  There are plot gaps the size of Montana.  The story doesn't track from Phantom to LND at all.  The characters are totally changed in ways that are clearly contrived to fit with the plot of LND.  And the score is okay but it is nowhere near as good as Phantom and it's simply not good enough to make up for the disaster of a screenplay. LND is based on a sequel to the book Phantom of the Opera NOT written by the author Gaston Leroux.  It's called Phantom of NY and it reads like (really) bad fan fiction.  Spoilers ahead:

1. In LND, Erik and Christine have a child together.  To make this happen, we're supposed to believe that right after Phantom ended they slept together the night she returned his ring.  When she woke up Erik was gone so she ran off and married Raoul.

There are about a hundred things wrong with this.  First off, we see Christine and Raoul leave in Phantom so it physically couldn't happen.  Second, all Erik wanted was someone to love him for him, and he was willing to kill Raoul to get the facade of that.  Now we're supposed to believe the minute he gets her love he runs off and leaves her?  Third, if Christine really loved Erik, why didn't she just wait?  She was at his house - he would have come back.  Fourth, Christine had no reason to want to sleep with Erik in Phantom.  He had kidnapped her, blackmailed her and threatened to kill her fiance.  And so she slept with him after all that?  Fifth, Christine and Raoul were engaged when all this supposedly went on, which makes her a pretty lousy person and a cheat.

2. Christine pawns off Erik's kid on Raoul.  So not only is she a cheat, she's also a liar.  Great, I'm glad I invested time watching such a worthy heroine in Phantom.

3. Raoul is a drunken, gambling louse.  This character change is very contrived.  All he ever wanted was Christine, and he risked his life to save her, and we're supposed to believe the minute he gets her, he casts her aside to get drunk?

4. By putting Erik back into Christine's life, the plot ruins him too.  Erik had lived a tortured life and he had taken it out on others by killing and frightening.  But Christine's pity and affectiion led to his one redeeming act: he let her go free.  To put them back together and give them a second chance destroys that sacrifice.  Although Erik's sacrifice didn't rise to the level of Sydney's in A Tale of Two Cities, putting Erik and Christine back together with a drunken Raoul is akin to having a sequel to A Tale of Two Cities where we learn that Sydney's death was faked and he goes back to London where Charles Darnay has become a drunk and a womanizer and now Sydney gets his shot with her.  What made Sydney's sacrifice beautiful is that he died for the woman he loved knowing not only that he could never have her but that someone else did; Erik's sacrifice at the end of Phantom is similar.  LND ruins it.

5. Christine, Raoul and Erik aren't the only characters that have been gutted: Meg and M. Giry are changed in less likeable ways too.

As an aside, I also think it was pretty wrong for ALW to do a sequel to Phantom.  Phantom is based on the book Phantom of the Opera written by Gaston Leroux.  The characters are Leroux's, and I don't think it's right to do a sequel to something that so drastically guts his characters.  It would be like doing a sequel to the play A Christmas Carol and having Tiny Tim grow up and join a gang.",1333411200,35,3458,4.303875968992248
4987047,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Filmed during its triumphant Melbourne run at the Regent Theatre, this sparkling production of LOVE NEVER DIES does mend a lot of the problems that the show suffered during its earlier troubled London incarnation.  With a lavish new set and costume concept by Gabriela Tylesova and a fabulous cast of new faces and old favourites, it has earned the praise of Lord Lloyd Webber, and most recently closed at Sydney's Capitol Theatre after a limited 12-week run, which was attended by sell-out, capacity houses.

Ten years after escaping to New York with the aid of Madame Giry (Maria Mercedes) and her daughter Meg (Sharon Millerchip), the Phantom (Ben Lewis) has established himself as a showman amid the freaks and oddities of Coney Island, where he has installed Meg as the headlining act of ""Phantasma"", his vaudeville theatre.  But he's still haunted by the memory of Christine, the beauteous young girl from the Paris Opera who inspired his creative hand but left him heartbroken.  When he learns that Christine (Anna O'Byrne) has been invited to America to sing for Hammerstein, he devises a plan to divert her journey to Coney, where he hopes she'll sing a new aria he has written especially for her.  Accompanied by her husband Raoul (Simon Gleeson) and their ten-year-old son, Gustave (Jack Lyall), Christine's world seems perfect, but once again confronted by the Phantom, she is also faced with finally dealing with the ghosts of her past...

Set ten years after the events of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", the passage of time has severely corroded the familiar characters who return for the sequel.  In the original, Christine was the nave opera ingnue, petrified and yet intrigued by her fascination with the Phantom.  Now at last, Christine has recognised, perhaps too late, their special bond, as she tells her son Gustave - ""Love is not always beautiful...make sure you don't forget...love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret"".  The love of Christine and the Phantom has only intensified during the ten long years since he disappeared without trace from the Paris Opera.  When they finally come face-to-face once more, Christine must make a final choice of where her heart truly lies.

Critics are always going to find major cracks within the veneer of LOVE NEVER DIES, but the Australian production, under the tight direction of Simon Phillips, finally presents a far more satisfying alternative to the problematic London production.  The London production was a frustrating animal, its various gathered elements almost but never *quite* clicking to create an organic whole.  In the Australian production, the story (slight as it may be) flows seamlessly under Andrew Lloyd Webber's beautiful score (which has undergone significant cutting and re-shuffling since the London opening).

Playing the Phantom and Christine are two relative newcomers - Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne.  Anna O'Byrne was one of the Christine covers/alternates in the last few legs of the latest Australasian tour of ""Phantom"", and has the most breathtaking voice - she's also one of the most physically-beautiful Christine's I've probably ever witnessed.  Although Ms O'Byrne is still quite young, I'm guessing in ""real life"" Christine was probably only in her late-teens/early 20's when she married Raoul and would have only just hit 30 when LOVE NEVER DIES takes place.

Ben Lewis gives us a more soulful, mellow Phantom, yet still quite menacing when he wants to be (for instance his threatening to do away with Gustave in order to force Christine to sing at ""Phantasma"").  Most Phans feel that Raoul is treated quite shabbily in LOVE NEVER DIES.  The sequel sees Raoul as a bitter, alcoholic mess who cares little for Christine or their son, and squanders the money she makes singing in drinking and gambling.  We're now far away from the starry Paris Opera roof where Raoul sang his devotion forevermore with ""All I Ask of You"".  To be fair, Raoul's character is explored quite sensitively in this new revised LOVE NEVER DIES, and Simon Gleeson's performance is fantastic.

Having earlier played Meg in the original Australian company of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", it is truly a delight to have Sharon Millerchip, a three-time Helpmann Award winner, back in the role for LOVE NEVER DIES.  Meg is a far more prominent figure in the sequel, and is a much more sympathetic, tragic figure than how she was drawn in the London production.  Maria Mercedes is a steely, powerfully-sung Madame Giry, the former Paris Opera ballet mistress who is now reduced to overseeing the garish kick-lines in ""Phantasma"".

In the period since LOVE NEVER DIES temporarily closed for revisions in London (before folding altogether), Andrew Lloyd Webber has re-shaped his score, with Glenn Slater and original ""Phantom"" lyricist Charles Hart also adding a few new touches.  It's significantly different from what is heard on the 2010 original cast album - and mostly for the better.  Phantom now sings ""Till I Hear You Sing"" right at the top of the show, Meg has some added material about her excitement of being reunited with Christine, ""Dear Old Friend"" has a lot of new lyrics, ""Heaven By the Sea"" has been completely taken out; and there's much more of the original ""Phantom"" included, which is lovely.  For instance, Christine sings ""Twisted Every Way"" in her dressing room before the music of ""Prima Donna"" sweeps her on to the stage of ""Phantasma""; and there's a few reprisals of the 'You have come here' lair motif.

LOVE NEVER DIES, it seems, will never be accepted by the serious Phans (who've been campaigning against the sequel ever since Lloyd Webber first announced he was writing one), and that is a shame.  Especially because this particular production, so beautifully staged and put together, is ""Phantom""'s equal in every possible way.  Believe me, I too adore ""Phantom"" (it's still my all-time favourite theatre experience) and it took a lot of persistence from me before I embraced what Lloyd Webber has tried to achieve in LOVE NEVER DIES.  There's a lot to love about this show, just give it a chance.  I cried when I saw it at the Capitol and had the exact same emotional reaction with the DVD.

The story, sets, costumes, peformers were all top notch, and the music is just out of this world!

This is the best score Webber has written in years, probably his best since Phantom. The changes that have been made since the London Show have improved the plot immensely, Australia has turned LND into a stunning piece of musical theater and everything just flows so much better.

The characters have all grown and evolved, Christine, The Phantom, and Raoul are more human then ever before.  And the chemistry between Ben and Anna just sizzles, they are amazing actors and they bring The Phantom and Christine to life brilliantly.

Love Never Dies should not be compared to Phantom of the Opera, it is its own story and deserves to be judged on it's own merits. Leave your bias at the door and you will no doubt be blown away by it, like I was.

4987049,1,B006GHA9VQ,"I am a huge fan of the original Phantom.  I remember receiving the original London cast recording (LP) for Christmas before the show opened on Broadway.  I was blown away by it, just listening to it you could picture what was happening on stage. I thought the score was gorgeous with almost every song memorable.  When I bought the Love Never Dies CD I was very disappointed, hard to follow with a very mediocre score.  When I heard the show had been revised for Australia I decided to go see it when it played on movie screens last month.  The staging may be a little different but this show is still a mess.  The best song in the show, Till I Hear You Sing Again, has been moved to the prologue, the idea of the Phantom having a theatre at Coney Island and being known as Mister Y (get it?) just seems silly.  As for Christine and the Phantom having a child together I'm reminded of a line in the original when the Phantom says to Christine ""that fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood has also denied me the joys of the flesh..."".  Doesn't that mean he hasn't had sex?  So how can they have a child together.  The changes in the characters (Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry) just seemed to have been made to move this silly plot along.  Another thing that irritated me about this show is the fact that ALW has used the tune to the title song twice before, on The Heart is Slow to Learn (watch Kiri te Kanawa sing it on You Tube) and Our Kind of Love from The Beautiful Game.  Can't he come up with an original title song?  My advice to you is to ignore this show and go watch the 25 anniversary of the Phantom dvd.

The characters have evolved and grown, and become more complex in their relationships with each other. They have become multi dimensional.

The gothic splendour of its Coney Island freak show setting allows the brilliant designer Gabriella Tylesova to provide a sumptuous feast for eyes with her totally breathtaking set design and costumes while the orchestrations and magnificient souring music reach into your soul and sweep you away - to another time - another place, just as Phantom does.

4987052,3,B006GHA9VQ,"The production was actually a lot better than I was expecting. The costumes and set from the Melbourne production were absolutely gorgeous. The musical itself was decent, if maybe a bit confused at time. It still had trouble getting over its biggest flaw, it was trying to be Phantom. Even putting aside the obvious character assassinations needed to make this story work, the music was just not on par with the original. ""Love End Dies"" was a lovely song but I did not for a second believe it was something the Phantom would have written. The original was a Victorian Gothic/High Romance and the music set the mood for that theme and it synced up. Love Never Dies simply did not have the same cohesiveness. I liked many of the songs but some of them just didn't fit the tone of the rest of the show. Meg's songs sounded like they'd be more at home in a more modern musical like Wicked, ""The Beauty Underneath"" felt like it should have been in a rock opera like Repo! and the other songs just didn't reach the same heights as Phantom of the Opera. That's not to say they were bad. I genuinely like ""The Beauty Underneath"" and ""Devil take the Hindmost"" and I still find myself humming ""Only for You"" sometimes. But being a sequel it has the sad misfortune of constantly being compared to the original and I simply didn't feel it measured up. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it worth buying?

4987056,4,B006GHA9VQ,"When I first heard of a Phantom sequel, I was excited, but also had my doubts.  Phantom phans can be vicious and I knew that for some the idea of a sequel smacked of heresy.

I immediately grabbed the London Recording and was enthralled by the music.  Beneath The Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, and Till I Hear You Sing were amazing.  Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess were absolutely incredible and the entire piece resonated with me.

The recording had a few miscues like Heaven By The Sea, but overall, I was entranced.

The show hit with mixed to negative reviews and immediately underwent a rewrite.  It is the results of those rewrites that appears on this video.

Let me start off by saying that while the 2nd Act has remained largely unchanged, with the exception of the final scene.  The 1st Act, however, has been heavily modified.  The show starts off with Till I Hear You Sing, and completely excises Heaven By The Sea and a majority of the prologue.

A central plot element is also tweaked.  In the original concept, Christine and Raoul are invited by Mr. Y (The Phantom) to perform.  The only ""trick"" the Phantom plays on the De Chagney's is in hiding his true identity.

In the modified plot, Christine and Raoul are invited to New York by Oscar Hammerstein to perform at a new Opera House he is opening and they are ""intercepted"" at the pier by The Phantom's ""freaks"" and brought back to Phantasma.  Raoul is coaxed out of his room on the premise to meet Oscar in the bar downstairs.  This allows the Phantom to sneak into and confront Christine.  Christine is then ""forced"" to sing ""Love Never Dies"" due to a veiled threat the Phantom makes towards the safety of her son, Gustav after the end of ""Once Upon Another Time"".  This makes the Phantom a much darker character, delving, again into the darkness seen in the first show.  It's obvious that Erik has no problems murdering (including children I suppose) those who would thwart his plans.

While this could be a bit more true to his character, it also makes him more schizoprenic.  In one scene he's threatening Gustav with bodily harm, and after he discovers Gustav's true parantage, he decides to leave ""all that he has ever made"" to his son.  This just comes across as too extreme.  The Phantom just seems to travel the whole emotional arc a bit too quickly.  In the original plot, the Phantom doesn't have to threaten Christine to get her to perform, so he doesn't quite have so far to travel from Dr. Mengele to Dr. Huxtable

""Dear Old Friend"" has also changed in tone.  I always saw this song in my minds eye as being sung through gritted teeth and forced smiles.  This is because in the original, Meg and Madam Giry seem to be well aware of Christines impending visit to Phantasma.  In the new version, Christine is not supposed to be there and Meg and Christine sort of bump into each other.  The song starts out very sincere and then changes in tone as each participant suspects they've been played, both by the Phantom and by each other.  I like watching the smiles change to grimaces as they perform their final toast.

Overall the production values and filming of this show are fantastic.  The set design is amazing, especially during ""The Beauty Underneath"", and ""Love Never Dies"".

The one weakness of the show is the fact that Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne are not Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  Yes, I know that is a shallow argument, but Karimloo and Bogness bring a fierceness and chemistry that literally leaps off the CD.  This chemistry is also apparant in their performance during the 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom Of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall.  Had this production had those two in it, this would have been a 5 star production in my mind.

Lewis and O'Byrne are capable, but I never truly bought Lewis as the Phantom.  O'Byrne was much better as Christine, and her scene with Gustave in ""Look With Your Heart"" is brilliant.

The other weakness is that this show never reaches the musical heights of the original CD.  Many people feel, including myself, that this is one of ALW's best scores, and it is truly showcased in the CD.  The score feels smaller in this production and not as glorious.  I understand changes were required to tweak the show.  And believe me, I don't grieve the loss of the painful ""Heaven By The Sea"".  But this show just never quite hit the heights of the original CD.

Overall this is a great show and I am thrilled that ALW decided to give everyone a chance to view it.

Make no mistake, this is no ""Phantom Of the Opera"", but it is no ""Starlight Express"" either and that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing!",1331164800,7,4667,4.5619735258724425
4987057,1,B006GHA9VQ,"This review is not necessarily based on the plot of LND itself but more on the poor style of filming and editing used.  LND was not filmed it the style of the recent 25th Aniversary Phantom at the Royal Albert Hall special.  THe RAH Phantom recording still gave you a wonderful sense of spectacle where as this did not.

In watching LND at a movie theater, there was no sense of grandeur or the theatrical experience due to the closely cropped facial shots.  The cinematic director relied far too heavily on close ups and, frankly, it made me feel like I was watching a poorly directed soap opera.

And when I say close ups, I mean ""count the performer's nose hair"" close and that's no joke.

I wanted to see how the sets moved and the overall choreography in some scenes, especially the quintet at the end with the Phantom, Raoul, Mme Giry, Meg and Gustav.  Instead the film kept jumping back and forth to faces.  And nostrils.

The performaces were fantastic even if I didn't care for the rehash of the plot from Phantom of the Opera.  Like comparing Coney Island to the Paris Opera House, Love Never Dies felt cheap and easy rather than rich and filling.

The DVD and Blu-Ray may be edited differently, so it may be worth a rental but unless you're a true fanatic and simply must collect all things Phantom, I'd advise you to stick with the cast recording and your own imagination rather than purcahse this.",1331164800,20,1410,4.511811023622047

4987062,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw this version at a theater in NY a few days ago. While I prefer the orginal POTO musical, I think it's a shame that LND never made it to Broadway. The story is gripping, and heartbreaking (depending on your POV, of course). For me, a Phantom Phan, I loved seeing Phantom and Christine together again... even if they play a little loosely with the original POTO ending. It's a great ""what could have been"" story and well worth seeing. A really nice story continuation.

The songs are, in my opinion, a little less sophisticated lyrically than the original POTO lyrics, but there are a few songs that really do stick with you. Try it out on spotify, they have the entire album to listen to for free.",1330905600,11,702,4.441860465116279
4987063,2,B006GHA9VQ,"Allow me to begin by saying that I love Andrew Lloyd Webber. I think he's brilliant. The stories are complex and winding, just as the music is. The music is always so beautiful in his pieces.

That said, the storyline of this musical is horrible, even with the rewrites done for this filmed Australian version. Nothing can save this plotline, as it honestly reads like very bad fanfiction. But there's some redemption, as the music is still beautiful and complex. It very much conveys the Coney Island feeling of strange and wonderful very well. Parts of the musical read like Rogers and Hammerstein (such as ""Look with You Heart,"" that could easily fit into something like 'The King and I' or 'The Sound of Music') while other parts are classic, 1970s ALW, such as ""The Beauty Underneath."" The cast is good. I do think it was well-cast. The production is beautiful--from the stage to the lights to the sound. But in the end, it is still related to this awful plotline that I'm not entirely sure why it exists. I think the music is complex and beautiful. The staging is beautiful and complex. But nothing can save this bad, almost melodramatic storyline.",1330732800,13,1154,4.712871287128713
4987064,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw it when it came out for theaters... Let me rephrase that, I was forced to go see it because I REALLY didn't want to go. I had all ready found out what would happen, and I can't begin to explain how much I despised Andrew Lloyd Webber for just destroying Phantom for me. 1st off, as much as I dislike Raoul, there is no way that he somehow turned into a drunkard and gambler. He is to much of a twelve year old girl. 2nd, New York... Really? He disliked leaving the opera house before and was a recluse what made them think that it was okay to stick him on a boat and ship him off to America? I had read the reviews for the London performance, and not just the critics. I had also heard some of the music from the London cast. I really didn't want to see it.

What saved this version was that it was the Australia version. Parts of the music had been changed, they had chosen a  great Christine, and their Erik was AMAZING. He really made the Phantom come to life. I am pre-ordering it. If you are a Phantom purist, you're going to have to let it stand alone from the movie/play/book, and if you can do that you'll find that it actually is really good.",1330646400,7,1157,4.092511013215859
4987065,4,B006GHA9VQ,"I remember as a kid wanting Christine to go with the Phantom. But as I got older, I picked Raoul too. So when I found out about Love Never Dies, I was very excited. I didn't do any research ahead of time (other than to see the basic concept), so I didn't know about any good or bad reviews. I was able to go in to the movie theater with an open mind. (For US residents, there's a second opportunity to view on 3/7/12 in select theaters.)

While the production is fantastically eye catching, I wouldn't really call it a sequel. Some of the characterizations weren't very true (Phantom seemed too Emo; the Girys were exceptionally greedy) or weren't believable at all (really deep character changing flaws in Raoul). And there are a couple points in the plot that are very predictable, but still enjoyable.

The costumes, makeup, sets, and music are beautiful. The costumes follow very well the change in both fashion and Old World (1895 Paris) versus New World (1905 New York) mentalities. I noticed another reviewer say that the music was average/not memorable and I completely disagree. Some of the songs seem a little forced to add atmosphere to the plot. But the core songs with Phantom and Christine are very memorable and moving. I purchased the CD the next day after seeing the production and as I listened to it, I found I even remembered some of the lyrics. And Christine's grand aria very much made me feel like it was part of the original Phantom production. The ending certainly follows the adage you either love opera or hate opera - there's no in between. The music and scene made me shed a few tears and feel deep empathy with Phantom.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Love Never Dies to any Phantom fan. I am very happy I have the DVD on pre-order. But take it more as an alternate future and appreciate it as a stand alone based on Phantom. It's not really a true sequel.",1330473600,39,1893,4.545454545454546
4987066,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw the show on a special presentation at movie theaters in US on late February 2012 and all I can say is: WOW!
I didn't see this coming.

The show was cancelled in London just months after its opening and they filmed the Australian production for DVD, so I expected to see another Webber's flop. Does anyone remember Woman in White?

But Love Never Dies is an amazing show, with incredible singers, beautiful songs and set.
Way deeper and more emotional than Phantom.

A beautiful experience that you don't want to miss!",1330473600,3,523,4.602150537634409
4987067,5,B006GHA9VQ,"My friend thinks I was crazy, just for the fact I have never EVER seen a musical. And yet I was willing to go see this in theaters. He tried to catch me up on what the Phantom is all about before it started. But I had a pretty good idea, based on the normal Hollywood movies. And I never was a true fan of musicals to be honest. But this... this was such pure art! I never been so drawn into a show like this, the lyrics to the songs, the singers themselves were just flawless, absolute perfection. The stage designs where beautiful and beyond creative. The ending kind of had me tearing up a bit, I can't wait for the rerun in the theater again. I will be seeing it again!
And if you haven't seen it, I would strongly recommend you going to see it.",1330473600,5,749,4.0675675675675675
4987068,3,B006GHA9VQ,"This version is a feast for the eyes. It's beautiful & glitzy. Had I never seen the London production,I would have really liked this version & given it 4/5 stars. But I saw the show 9 times in London, including the night it closed where Lord Lloyd-Webber proclaimed it, ""the saddest night of my career."" You could immediately connect with the characters as they were played. Ben Lewis' Phantom is hard to like until he shows his more human side. He plays it as he was directed, as a very dark character. Anna O'Byrne, sings well but seemed a bit one dimensional. I saw the original cast headed by Ramin Karimloo & Sierra Boggess-the current stars of POTO 25th Anniversary. His Phantom picked up the character from where the original Phantom left off. There was never a doubt that they loved each other,or that she knew he was alive, but they made their choices long ago. Christine is very conflicted- wanting to stay true to her more loutish husband, Raoul, yet knowing the music completes her. ""Beautiful,"" Gustav's melody, was more entwined in the story & was impossible to get from my mind. I'd already heard the main songs & was startled & delighted by the London version of ""The Beauty Underneath."" I still think this is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score and I am delighted that they filmed it. I am just saddened they filmed the wrong one.",1330473600,46,1344,4.627615062761507
4987069,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I just saw the film version of LND in Kansas City. I must tell you I fell in love with the Phantom all over again. I enjoyed the music and the way music from the original POTO was found entwined with the LND music.
I have  question for the fans. Ar our screening last night, the musical scene with Meg and her troupe was tainted with some sound issues. We could not heard the troupe but Meg's voice was loud and clear. Did anyone else have this problem? I am hoping that this was only at our theater. I have not noticed anyone mentioning this issue in other comments or in reviews of the dvd. I am hoping this was only our theater's issue.
But even with this problem, I enjoyed the film tremendously. I have my dvd on preorder and can not wait to get it.",1330473600,,754,4.129251700680272

4987071,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I just saw this in movie theaters. I am certainly going to buy it! The story is so full of emotion, the sets are phenomenal, and the songs are great. This show is a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, and some themes from The Phantom carried over to this show. A lot of new elements have been added to the plot. For instance, Christine is marrried to Raoul and their marriage is troubled. They have a son. And the Girys become ""frenemies"" of the family de Chagny.

I feel the need to add:  The original show that was in London was reviewed badly, but this is an entirely different production. I would recommend watching the trailer for this on YouTube. It gives you a good idea of what to expect with the musical's sets, choreography, and one of the songs.",1330473600,4,756,4.316901408450704
4987072,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Overall, I thought it was amazing. The Australian director made many changes from the failed London show, and I hope to see this version on Broadway eventually. It has very beautiful music, the performers are amazing, and the sets are spectacular. There are a few minor things that irked me, but I think it definitely lived up to POTO as a companion piece.",1330387200,3,356,4.666666666666667
4987073,5,B006GHA9VQ,I was never a fan or Phantom Of The Opera. Unforgetable music and an amazing production but the story left me cold. The  sequel was released on bluray  in february  in Australia whilst the  stage show was still showing here. This  production  is absolutely breathtaking .A brilliant and flawless cast make this a show to see again and again.  The music was  hauntingly  beautiful  and unforgettable. Much better that the original Phantom as far as the story goes. It is  very very rare for me get so engrossed in a  show that I wanted to see it again immediately  after it finished. In an age of dismal musicals it is great to finally see one that  is amongst  the very best I have ever seen. The bluray quality  is  briliant. More extras would have been welcome.,1330214400,3,763,4.492647058823529
4987074,4,B006GHA9VQ,"This is only, perhaps, the item that is available in Thailand but not yet in the U.S. I have watched this show in Melbourne last fall far away from the stage (it was the unplanned ticket). I have never seen the show in London that has already closed but I have listened the London production audio CD sung by RK and SB over 100 times !
Seeing this show again on BD - it's quite spectacular. Like the microphone on the forehead, far less distracting than the jaw one like in 25th POTO. However, remembering remotely from the live show back then, I don't recall - Till I hear you sing started the story - I noticed lot of changes in lyrics and also sequences and many parts of story. Like some of them but don't like some of them, too  - i.e. the way phantom forced Christine to sing in this Australian production - in London audio CD - it seems like Christine has agreed to do it voluntarily.

Don't like the way Ben Lewis doesn't sing high note on ""be enthralled to need..."" in beauty underneath, and the boy has to do the same. Like the London version better on this one. Also - Devil takes the hind most, my Dear old friends (but the Oz version makes more sense)- like London version better.

Otherwise, it's quite a nice show - spectacular, ravishing and breathtaking - I had hoped that Christine will bleed from the GSW since this is the BD recording - they should have invested on that. It's a close up and there was no blood on the dying shot person.

Still love it anyway. Love Anna singing voice - couldn't decide who's better between SB or AB.",1329609600,4,1552,4.304794520547945
4987075,5,B006GHA9VQ,"I saw the show in London and then twice in its reconfigured version in Melbourne, so you could say I am a fan. For me the best of Webber is Cats closely followed by Jesus Christ Superstar... and then this great piece. I prefer it to Phantom with its murderous madness. Probably the best thing about the show is the way the songs become emblazened in the mind. This used to happen quite frequently up to the mid 1970s but nowerdays is quite rare - things are so bland. Not this show and especially not the Melbourne version. Pointless to list the many great songs except perhaps to point out that 'Dear Old Friends' gets much better treatment in the revised version than the sarcastic original, and 'Ten Long Years' is more dramatic. The story line is much improved - the Phantom foxier - and the over-the-top number 'The Beauty Underneath' is rescued somewhat by the dramatic staging, which was incredibly effective on stage but loses some of its dramatic impact on Blu-Ray.

The Blu-Ray gives emphasis to the characters and has a close perspective. This works well as a representation of the fine acting and singing, but misses some of the drama of the incredible stage props. I cried the first time I heard the title song and found it highly moving and impressive in Melbourne, but on the disk the wonderful peacock stage is somewhat diminished. Anna O'Byrne as Christine is a new star of the stage, with her classically trained voice and noble profile creating a truly magnetic performance. And isn't the little boy remarkable? The disk is a worthy souvenier but probably also works well as an introduction for the novice.",1329264000,4,1625,4.701754385964913
4987076,3,B006GHA9VQ,"There is much to praise in the Australian production of LND. Unfortunately the music is not among them. First this show looks INCREDIBLE. Set design, lighting and costuming give the show a wonderful fantastic eerie look. Song wise nothing stayed with me. One song has a huge build up the Phantom has written an amazing song for Christmas the singing of which will have very serious consequences the tune though well sung is only adaquate and so is a huge let down. Also the story is as ludicrous as the original Phantom (maybe be more so) but because the songs are average it was more difficult to suspend disbelief. I found it hard to believe the sequence of events leading to the finale and I found the outcome improbable too. None of this is the fault of the impeccable cast who sing and smoulder well! Credit to the Australian team for doing such a good job with this material. The DVD is beautifully filmed balancing between making it clearly a filmed musical with the correct sets and lighting and using close ups etc to heighten drama on a TV screen.
 Keen ALW fans and those interested to see how effective filming a musical can be may be interested,just don't be surprised if the music falls a little short of expectation.",1329177600,8,1231,4.595454545454546

4987078,5,B006GHA9VQ,"Just for clarification for others, the blu-ray is actually released in Australia and New Zealand. Having seen this in person live at Sydney Capitol, this live recording made in Melbourne is an accurate reproduction of what is currently playing in Sydney, so are the cast. Note that the arrangement and lyrics differs to the original London version, which has since improved. I strongly suggest you pick up a copy if you so happen to see the musical currently in Sydney, it is not region locked and will play on a US Playstation 3. The quality of the Blu-ray is amazing, down to each cast's expression, makeup, props and detailed/intricate costume designs. The camera can get really disorientating at times, I would rather have a version that has a camera angle that does not move.

The cast was phenomenal, the set, costumes ad music was awesome. They did make changes from Australian Show. The U.S. debut showed more of Gustave and his singing ( his mother's operatic range). This musical showed the love story more in depth and made me cry. I hope it does well in U.S. and goes on to Broadway and perhaps a movie. The Bushnell cast was phenomenal.

I listened to the London cast soundtrack because Ramin will always be my all time favorite Phantom and I then I had to see how everything turned out.  Ben Lewis is another great Phantom that brings another level to the character.
