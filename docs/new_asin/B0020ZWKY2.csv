3831187,1,B0020ZWKY2,"The written description & the photo on front cover suggests the scenery will focus on ocean views but the main views include roads (complete with yellow lines!) with weeds and a few palm trees on both sides. It felt more like a car ride than a bike ride.  Maybe 5 seconds of ocean views. I was so disappointed.  Hawaii has so many BEAUTIFUL beaches they could have included.  On a positive note, Amazon made the return extremely simple.",1273017600,2,436,4.564102564102564
3831188,5,B0020ZWKY2,"I have almost all of the Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs. I haven't been to Hawaii's Big Island in person, but after cycling it, I feel like I've been there. I found myself checking to see if there were any little local restaurants to stop in and get some lunch, just as I would have if I had been there on vacation. At one point I found myself looking for a place I might want to live. How far do I want to be from town? I have visited Kauai, which I believe may be the least commercialized of all the Hawaiian Islands and I can't wait for the Kauai DVD to come out. It doesn't really matter what comes out next. I'll probably buy it and enjoy it. These are great ways to stay fit!  The time just zips by and my exercise is done for the day. Often I keep going. It's just that much fun. I look forward to my ""vacation"" time every day.",1267920000,,830,4.03030303030303
3831189,3,B0020ZWKY2,I have the So Utah bike o vision DVD and I love it! I was anxious to try Hawaii and I was disappointed. I found the DVD to be very dreary and boring. I think if they had made the video when the sun was shining it would have been a completely different video. It was overcast and rainy throughout most of the video. There were beautiful beach shots and inland shots but the video could not hold my interest due to the lack of sunshine. I would not recommend this video if you are like me and prefer the sun to keep you motivated.,1264204800,10,528,4.038095238095238
3831190,5,B0020ZWKY2,"Due to a knee injury, I am unable to go out walking like I used to.  An exercise bike was given to me but I hated watching television shows or listening to just music when I used the bike.  I ran across the Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs and I was hooked.  I set my bike up close to the television and started the dvd. This is a bike ride seen from the rider's view.  You go biking around the Big Island of Hawaii and I am completely lost in the ride.  You find yourself gazing back and forth at the sights, watching out for cars...LOL, and just take a bike ride.  I encourage people to use these tapes when using your stationary bikes.  It is great!",1264032000,8,646,4.12

A great little video for indoor cycling on a cold winters day. I've been to Hawaii though not to the Big Island with it's lava rock beaches and an active volcano but I felt like I was back in the islands again with this video. Like most of the Hawaiian islands there's a dry side and a wet side. The dry side is the western side and it can be almost desert-like and the wet side is the eastern side which has rainforests. The look is different and the weather can be very different on the same day. This video explores both sides. I loved riding along and felt like I was back in the islands. Here's a one-minute clip of the hour-plus video. Permission to use this Youtube clip was granted.  Aloha!",1391904000,7,1124,6.01875
3831222,4,B0020ZWKY2,It's an interesting diversion while riding a stationary bike or running on a treadmill.  I liked it as a diversion to just listening to music or staring at the wall or a tv on the news.,1369440000,,185,4.138888888888889
3831223,5,B0020ZWKY2,This movie is great while using your stationary bike. Makes the ride go by very pleasant. I would highly recommend it.,1368748800,2,118,4.666666666666667
3831224,1,B0020ZWKY2,"I thought this video was like other scenic cycling videos where you get nice scenery but with instructions regarding hills.  I watched this video and it's just a car tour of not so nice parts of Hawaii to cheeseball music that doesn't help you spin to get a workout.  If you want to lazily cycle to not so interesting tour of Hawaii, then this video is for you. If you want a spinning workout with nice scenery, this video is NOT for you. Plus the disk looks like it was burned at home.  I don't recommend purchasing this.  I would like to return it but i already opened it unfortunately.",1367193600,,588,4.318181818181818
3831225,4,B0020ZWKY2,"This video is exactly like being on the big island of Hawaii!!! Some have commented that it is cloudy and rainy at points, and that there are not a lot of beach scenes.  These observations can all be explained.  It is sometimes cloudy because there is always ""vog"" (volcanic fog) over part of the island due to the active volcano.  Also, the volcano is located in a rain forest.  It is nearly always misting on that part of the island.  Also, the Hilo side of the island gets rain nearly every day. The Kona side only seems to get rain at night.  And lastly, there are very few white sand beaches on this island.  The island is made up of volcanic rock and it is everywhere....from far inland to the ocean.  Biking with this video is like being back to the island.  Beautiful!  I will say that the music on these DVDs is just awful.  Pandora radio tuned to the Hawaiian Radio station sets just the right mood!",1357257600,,909,4.351190476190476
3831226,4,B0020ZWKY2,"Its fun riding the familiar roads on the Big Island when I am stuck at home riding my staionary bike because its raining and cold outside!

Could be a little longer!",1325203200,,165,4.32258064516129
3831227,3,B0020ZWKY2,"I use these dvd's to run on the treadmill. I have purchased several other Bike-O-Vision dvd's for the same purpose and this isn't one of my favorites. The scenery is good in a lot of the dvd, but I really don't like how curvy some of the road filming is. At some of the faster speeds, it is a little dizzying to me. Of course, this dvd beats running staring at a blank wall and is meant for bikes, but I think I would feel the same on a bike.",1322784000,,442,3.922222222222222
3831228,1,B0020ZWKY2,"This dvd is one dark tree lined road after another.
Barely a glimpse of any beach,  any where.
No cadence information.
It's the first Bike-O-Vision I have ever purchased,
I won't be buying any others.  Spinning.com has a
new Ireland dvd that is very good,  buy that instead.",1303344000,,274,4.666666666666667

THESE ARE NOT THE WIDESCREEN VERSIONS, BUT STILL OKAY.",1284681600,2,258,4.7555555555555555
3831230,4,B0020ZWKY2,I ordered this DVD when I purchased the Keiser spinning bike on Amazon.com. It is great watching the DVD when on the bike. I have been to Hawaii 4 times but the main island only once (20yrs ago). It was nice to see those shots again on the main island. The only thing I am not crazy about is the music. The first song was hawaiian which was great but then the other songs were not hawaiian and not so great but the beat was a good exercise tempo. I also ordered the California and Europeon DVD which I have not watched yet.  I'm still enjoying my Hawaiian one.,1282435200,2,560,4.137614678899083

8348740,5,B0020ZWKY2,These are great for indoor cycling (spin bikes) to take you on a journey.,1473206400,,73,4.285714285714286
8348741,2,B0020ZWKY2,"I thought this was a new DVD, but it skipped and stopped a lot.  Also, the picture quality was a little blurry.  Great idea, but not a great DVD.",1469836800,,145,3.9655172413793105
8348742,3,B0020ZWKY2,"I purchased this video as a gift for an instructor who teaches spin classes.  It's just ok, you get a slow riding tour around the Island as if you were riding a bike.  I've seen worst on other spin videos.  The price point is ok! So, I'll leave it up to you to make the decision on the purchase.  Delivery was on time.",1445558400,,318,4.0
8348743,3,B0020ZWKY2,"If you are looking for a DVD to keep your mind on spinning this is ok, but it's not good for a workout. Just music and beautiful scenery.",1421712000,,137,3.9285714285714284
8348744,5,B0020ZWKY2,"Wow, what a workout! I'm addicted to Bike-O-Vision's DVDs. They're such high quality and awesome camera work that it makes you feel like you're really in Hawaii. I would recommend these DVDs to all of my friends and family. Personally I normally hate working out but lately I've been motivated because I can't stop watching the beautiful scenery that this DVD offers.",1412812800,,367,4.935483870967742
8348745,2,B0020ZWKY2,"Very poor quality, to the point that I could not ride it all the way through.  It skips and jams and just not a good duplication process.",1406764800,,137,4.074074074074074
8348746,4,B0020ZWKY2,"Got to watch a couple of the scenes before I had a fall.  Now am unable to exercise.  Of course, the scenery is lovely.  I had always wanted to visit Hawaii.  Feel I took a quick trip.",1395014400,,184,3.891891891891892
8348747,5,B0020ZWKY2,"Again, I like rides that give me something to look at, other than the road.  Otherwise, I can use my cycle-ops trainer and stare at the beige walls.  Anyhow, this one is fun cuz you see the lushness of Hawaii but also the little towns and the volcano areas, complete with steam vents.  Not gonna ride past that where I live!
The rides are at a nice pace, but not for hardcore aerobic workouts.  So if you are looking for the cycle-til-you-drop, sweat-like-a-pig ride this series will not do for you.  But for exercise for the Average Jane, this is great.",1393718400,,554,4.445544554455446
8348748,5,B0020ZWKY2,This is exactly what I was looking for in a virtual reality bike ride. This has nursed me through some rough times on the exercise bike during physical therapy. So thank you and I will be keeping an eye on your store in the future.,1393459200,,231,4.155555555555556
