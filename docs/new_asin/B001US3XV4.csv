In the 21st century, a family of vampires settled down in Japan. They lived among humans and sucked their blood quietly and discreetly. However their daughter Karin had a secret that she could not share with anyone. She did not suck blood like the rest of the family. Instead, her blood level increases! She is a blood-making vampire!

My Review:
Karin is a romantic comedy anime. The story is well written and fun. The animation isn't bad it also isn't the best. The backgrounds are rather banal, but the character designs are cute. The only bonus features are non-credit opening and closing sequences.  The box is flimsy (as are most slim box sets) and the cases hold two discs each (which is usually annoying, but in this case the ""hubs"" won't break off easily leaving the discs to slide around the case). There are six discs with 4 episodes per disc (meaning there are 24 episodes total).

Overall, Karin is entertaining to watch, but only rates 4 stars. I'm happy with my purchase. Oh! Also the manga Chibi Vampire (printed by Tokyopop) was the basis for this anime. In case anyone was wondering...

3803934,5,B001US3XV4,"I first began collecting the Karin Series last year when it was released by Geneon after the third volume it was gone. Gone! and all the trades said it was gone for good! Off into a vast anime oblivion, discontinued due to a failed distribution company. Thankfully My Personal Heroes at Funimation Entertainment caught the rights to distribute Karin and other Geneon Niche titles to the US and Canada.

Well enough of the history lesson. This anime is truly a great piece of art, and No I don't believe I'm overstating it either. The Original Manga by Yuna Kagesaki differs somewhat from the anime namely the anime could not be an exact expression of Manga-ka Kagesaki's vision it had to be cut down to fit into a 25 episode series, and ""work for TV"". The Manga covers over 13 volumes of text and art. (avilable fom Tokyopop under the title Chibi Vampire) originaly published in ""Monthly Dragon Magazine"" and ""Monthly Comic Dragon"" in Japan. The animation was done by JC Staff known for fanservice, but, though evident, it is toned way down in the this series. The now defunct Odex of singapore produced the English dub. The English version was written and directed at Odex by American voice artist and puppetteer. Mr. Paul Pistore. Who's script provided a very fluid dialect in English, which in my opinion captured the original writers intent fully. I have shaired many e-mails with Mr. Pistore regarding his work on Karin and other more recent projects. The main cast besides Mr. Pistore consists of Ms. Chelsea Curto as Karin Marker, and Mr. Yahav Rom as Kenta Usui. Both are excelent matches for their respective charicters, along with Mr. Pistore and the balance of the cast, well they should all be recognized for their work.

Karin is a very emotional story of unexpected love between classmates Kenta Usui, the new transfer student from the north with funny eyes, and Karin Marker, a popular, yet youthfully awkward child of immigrant parents who has lived her life in Japan as a native aparently since early childhood.

Here's one of the hooks, Karen is a vampire. Or rather her situation is being an outsider in her own family. Instead of sucking or rather drinking human blood Karin's body overproduces blood which she must either inject into a ""victim"" or she suffers painful and profuse nose bleeds, this qualifies her as an un-vampire.

""Look for a more friendly vampire mythos in Karin, it's not the same old Dracula, Twilight, Forever Knight, Ann Rice, stuff. It's much more... Friendly, as I said, and Karinesque vampires are more like a subspecies of human than the usual 'undead bloodsucker mythos' which we've all seen before.""

Considering this is a vampire title I was astounded to see the morality that each charicter shows. Kenta Usui dreams of working hard and being a good citizen and a family man. Karin also works hard like Kenta is genuenly a moral person, her family, though vampiric is a traditional nuclear family, and despite family disputes they all appear in their own way to love and support Karin. There really are no villans, only people with different perspectives.

One interisting thing is that Kenta is not bound to Karin by some spell, curse, transdimentional warp, Renfield like devotion, or any other anime cliche' devise, as I would have expected. His bond to Karin Grows out of his and her personalities, and his desire to be friendly and a good man.  Karin's situation is a little more camplex. She feels uneasy near Kenta and has nose bleeds, she cheers herself, and himself up by making him a bento lunch, daily! As time goes by, boy and girl together, well you know.

I think Love would have come to the couple sooner if they weren't constantly interupted by, Vampire hunters, classmates, and Karin's family attempting to stop their budding relationship.

This anime is also very much about acceptance. When Kenta finds out about Karin's vampiric heritage, he does not freak out, he accepts her as she is. Later Karin's friends find out her secret and they accept her. Even the supposed villians accept her, and eventualy Karin's family accepts Kenta, except for her father Henry Marker (voiced by Paul Pistore) who is stereotypicaly overprotective of his teenage daughter.

I think of this series and it makes me smile. It works as a shonen and as a shojo title. It's so darn emotional and downright sweet, you'll have to brush your teeth/fangs afterwards, or you'll get cavities.",1237766400,21,4433,4.851851851851852

3803936,5,B001US3XV4,I have a small to moderate library of anime that I go to watch when I cannot find anythin I want to watch on line. I love the kind twist to the vampire storyline in this anime.,1317340800,,176,3.7837837837837838
3803937,4,B001US3XV4,"The plot line was interesting and the art work was admirable, but the story was slow at points. Overall it was worth the investment and made a nice addition to my collection.",1308528000,,174,4.46875
3803938,2,B001US3XV4,"I sat there, watching it with my nieces, the is the only reason I purchase it. Originally I have it, but not on English audio, I couldn't believe my eyes, as I watch the first episode and the next and so on, all the way to the end of the series. What a chop up job they done, 2 to 5 mins have been cut off from each episode. This is what happen when they transfer Japanese audio to English audio, the chop up most scenes in order to fit with their translation. For any one who is a fan of manga, don't purchase it, for those who have never seen it or read the books, go for it. The quality audio and image are great if you have a big screen TV. P.S if you think that my nieces didn't notice the cuts, your wrong.",1296691200,4,712,3.8835616438356166
3803939,5,B001US3XV4,"Karin is about a young high school girl who happens to be a vampire, however unlike other vampires Karin is an un vampire, her body produces to much blood and she have to pump it into someone or she will get massive nose bleeds. Also vampires in this setting have one type of human they like to feed on, this includes Karin, who is attracted to misery, so when she meets a boy who live with his poor mother and who have more than a few problems of his own Karin decides to make him a lunch box every day at school to cheer him up so she would not get nosebleeds around him all the time. Unfortunately it do not always work and the young boy, Kenta Usui discovers Karins secret, her family, who off course are vampires, charge the young man to be their daughter's protector. What follows is a cute romantic comedy story with characters good enough that the viewer really hope things will go well for them.

Now this anime is half episodic, some sort of problem arises with Karin, her vampire family, Kenta, or one of her school friends, which includes a vampire hunter, the problem get solved and the episode ends, but there is also a overarching storyline. Another nice thing about Karin is that the anime actually have an end, there is a climax and a satisfying ending to the show, a feature which many animes lack.

Karin is a very sweet an innocent show and I would have no qualms about letting a little girl watch it, also the fact that Karin is living a normal life, and have a family who are rather normal despite being vampires so you get the mix of the mundane and the creepy should be appealing to anyone who likes things the Addams Family and the Munsters or for younger generations Gravedale High or Monster High. There is no nudity here, and except for a very few scenes there is no violence.

Karin take the concept of vampires and make a pleasing twist to it. There are many vampire animes, both in the horror and the romance genre but Karin is very different, if you have seen allot of vampire animes and is looking for something new, or if you are tired of vampires all together then Karin might still catch your interest, and for huge vampire fans Karin is so cute and out of the ordinary that it is impossible not to love the show. Also if you think Karin is only for children think again, yes it would be a good show for kids, but I am an adult and I adore it. I think Karin is one of those shows which is suited for all ages.

The animation of Karin is very good, the colors are vibrant and the artistic style is very suited to the show. As for music it is not bad at all, but it is not very memorable either, however generally Karin is great technically. The only real complaint I have about Karin is that there are a few details which are not explained in the anime, such as the nature of Anju's (Karin's little sister) talking doll, you need to read the manga to get what is up with him. However generally this show have not fallen into the common trap of relaying on that viewers have read the manga, there are a few slip ups, like with the doll, but for the most part Karin is self contained and one can definitely enjoy it without having read the manga.

In conclusion Karin is a brilliant anime, it is fun and heath warming and just creepy enough to be interesting, it is a fresh breath to the vampire genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it, I think it might be the anime series I enjoyed most last year. Karin for the win.",1296345600,2,3451,4.278713629402756
3803940,5,B001US3XV4,"I love this anime and recommend it for any collector. Karin is based off of the manga Chibi Vampire by Yuna Kagesaki. Karin Maaka is an un-vampire. She doesn't drink blood, she makes it. Karin must bite a human and inject her blood into them or she will suffer a nose bleed once a month. She follows the sleep pattern of humans, goes to school and eats human food.

3803944,5,B001US3XV4,"Not your generic vampire story. Romantic comedy about an ""UnVampire"". Great story and writing, good character development. Limited fan service, but parents should watch before just to be aware. Some mild to moderate violence (what's a vampire story without vampire hunters?). Interesting (but a bit too ""good"") ideas on vampires. This does lend itself to the story though, so it works well. Mostly a character driven story rather than being about vampires. Either despite that or possibly because of it this is an excellent series!
Worth the time and money if you want a laugh or just like romantic comedies. (And maybe even if you don't). It is definitely on my ""must see"" list.",1278374400,,679,4.964912280701754
3803945,5,B001US3XV4,"I bought Karin with some reservations, and the first episode made me a little wary that it was just going to be extremely stupid...but the anime grew rapidly on me. It is filled with slapstick comedy, dysfunctional yet loving families, and touches interesting topics. While the side characters are both comical and endearing, I loved seeing the relationship between Karin and Kenta grow from her trying desperately to avoid him---to the incredibly strong friendship in which both trust each other and confide in each other---to finally realizing they're in love...and what that would mean for a vampire (or 'un-vampire') and a human.

Overall I enjoyed this series entirely, and if you want a very good laugh, some sweet romance, and a little dash of the supernatural...give this a try :)",1277078400,,788,5.061538461538461
3803946,4,B001US3XV4,"Karin is a romantic comedy and in turn should be judged as such. Although the common pretty girl= nose bleed anime formula is used in this series, Karin did a good job at adjusting it for its own appeal. In this case Karin, the female lead, was the one getting nose bleeds. Not only because of the male lead, but also because of her being an un-vampire.

Essentially, for Karin's vampire lore, vampires only feed on a type of blood relating to an emotion when they peak/need to feed. In Karin's case when she peaks, she gets a nose bleed. The story pretty much revolves around this design. As well as Usui, the boy who knows of Karin's secret and, their growing relationship. Aside from the addition of several useless characters, mainly a van hellsing type, any action in this series is used to heighten romantic bits.

The animation style complimented the characters well, the English cast was a good fit, and although the soundtrack was a little lacking at times, what bits there were sounded alright. For romantic comedy anime standards, Karin is another good title. Enjoy.",1273017600,,1077,4.723404255319149
3803947,5,B001US3XV4,"First, I stumbled upon Karin by accident.  I wasn't expecting to like it simply because I didn't really care for the Vampire premise that it was based on, and I had already been vampired out by a series called ""Moonphase"" (which is also good in its own way).

This story takes its own angle to tell a story about a teenager who isn't really a vampire, but an anti-vampire (blood-giver not sucker).  The style of the series reminded me of the Addams Family in the daughter's point of view (The daughter as in the Addam's Family's daughter)  In ""Karin's"" point of view she is not like the rest of her family -a black sheep of the family.  As she, a normal teenager, finds interest in a mysterious transfer student things become quite interesting as she has to deal with what any other teen goes through- the challenges of romantic relationships.

If there is one thing that the Japanese artists are best at, it's being able to convey the human emotions and realistic human situations both light-hearted and fun, and heavy-hearted and heartbreaking.  I have yet to find an animation done anywhere else that is able to convey that kind of energy so easily.

Anyways, Karin is a great story and well animated and definitely worth holding on to.",1271721600,8,1239,4.651376146788991

It won't change the world - not even the world of anime - but it solidly hits its mark and succeeds where it counts.

From the first couple episodes, Karin-chan sucked me in and kept me coming back for more.  Not every episode drove the plot line, but I never got the sense that it veered too far off track or that it was too uneven.

I won't bother with plot summaries, or an in-depth review of the release, as others have covered that quite well.  I'll just stick to a simple plug.  If you're looking for a lighthearted, cute, funny, and touching series, you won't be disappointed!",1250294400,,751,4.445255474452555

3803953,4,B001US3XV4,"Here's a fun fact for you: Japan is the only country in the world that does not have it's own vampire folklore.  It's all imported.  As a result, the Japanese almost always have a unique, bizarre, and interesting take on vampirism, be it the immortal monster who sates his eternal boredom by crushing villagers under his heel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Hunter-D/dp/B00004Y7JH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Hunter D</a>), a dark magical girl variation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Princess-Miyu/dp/B00005B8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Princess Miyu</a>), or the bizarre alien invasion of ""Goke, Bodysnatcher From Hell"" (Amazon, why do you not have this DVD?). Anime in particular is rife with creative variations on our Western vampire mythology and this one takes that license further than any other.  ""Karin"" is a supernatural romantic comedy series based on the popular manga series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chibi-Vampire/dp/1598163221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chibi Vampire</a>.  That name pretty much says it all.  There's nothing frightening at all about this fanged female.  She's a shy saccharine sweetheart who hasn't yet come into her vampiric powers and can still attend high school during the day while her dysfunctional family slumbers.  It's a flawed but bold concept that falls victim to more than a few anime cliches, but mostly wins the viewer over with fresh ideas, lovable characters, and stylish comedy.

When Karin's powers manifest themselves, she discovers that she is not a true vampire at all; more like a reverse vampire, an unvampire.  She produces blood rather than needing to feed on it and if she doesn't bite a human to inject her blood into somebody, it explodes in a beautiful cascade of the red, red vino (often made to appear as a blast of pretty crimson flowers) out of her nose.  Socially awkward, much!?  I never get tired of her scream of ""IIIYEEEEEEEAAA!!!"" when it happens.  One of the more interesting aspects of the series is what the vamps call ""blood affinity"", which is to say that each nosferatu has an individual human trait that they are attracted to in the blood.  One vampire may not be able to resist the blood of liars, for instance, and when they feed on a liar, that trait will vanish from the human.  Another may prefer vanity, jealousy, or any other negative trait.  Karin is attracted to depression.  And it just so happens that the classmate she has a crush on, Kenta Usui, has a very bad home life.  So anytime she goes near him, her body goes into overdrive and her blood begins to overflow.  She finds some solace early on when she loses control and feeds on Kenta's clinically unfortunate mother, temporarily relieving herself of her excess blood problem and releasing the woman from her deep melancholy.  Karin is appalled at herself and does everything she can to find another way to deal with her problem; throwing herself in to making Kenta happy so that his sadness will not cause her blood to increase.

The coy relationship between the two leads takes up a lot of the series early on and is annoyingly cliche.  I'm tired of anime where couples are perpetually unable to touch each others' hands on accident without blushing and always seem on the verge of the first kiss that never happens (though to be fair, it's a bite in this case) sometimes for seasons on end.  Shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Please-Teacher/dp/B000H0MN26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Please Teacher!</a>&nbsp;have a far more interesting dynamic where the relationships progress more like they do in real life rather than remaining in a perpetual state of naive limbo.  But thankfully, Karin has a dynamic home life to make up for the dud romance.  Her parents are a hoot, her elder brother's constant stalking of every woman he meets is amusing, and her creepy little sister with a possessed cleaver-wielding dummy always on her hand is hilarious.  Early on, an obnoxious, incompetent, overbearing vampire hunter named Winner shows up at the school and (surprise, surprise) falls madly in love with our heroine.  He's an annoying character that adds another layer of cliche and provides few laughs, but is thankfully downplayed for while.  Later in the show when Karin's grandmother, Elda, escapes from confinement (Karin's mom piled rocks on her evil mother-in-law's coffin to trap her) then the series becomes extremely entertaining and even compelling.  The final run takes a seriously dramatic turn as Winner's hardcore vamp hunter grandfather shows up to exterminate Karin's entire clan.  The final episode is mostly in black-and-white save for a lake of blood which produces a very cool effect and makes for a hell of a showdown.  While the show appears set to end on a seriously dark note, it ends up disappointing on that front.  But the incredible imagery of the climax largely makes up for the lame ending that follows.  Another season is somewhat hinted at at the end of the credits, but has yet to materialize so far.

 ""Karin"" is a fun series for someone who is looking for a little light-hearted vampire humor.  The art is extremely endearing (except for Kenta's perpetually vacant, beady-eyed expression) and there are several laugh-out-loud moments like when a curious Kenta asks Karin's mother if she'd die from a stake through the heart and she draws back, aghast and snaps back ""wouldn't anyone?"".  There's plenty of dark humor, some cool imagery, very interesting ideas, and -as I said before- some really likable characters.  It's a very different twist on the vampire genre and anybody curious should give it a shot.

3 1/2 stars rounded up for turning a well-worn genre on it's ear.",1244592000,,5867,5.371584699453552
3803954,3,B001US3XV4,"Karin is one of those unmistakably quirky but loveable Geneon properties that many anime fans (such as myself) feared would go down with the ship.  Fortunately, Funimation has been diligent in their efforts of tossing out the lifeboats for countless such titles by re-releasing them to the North American market in all their original glory.

Released across 6 DVDs, the Funimation version of Karin consists of three thin packs (each containing two discs) within a tasteful cardboard slipcase.  The show comes in at a 580-minute runtime and wears a fairly conservative 13+ rating.  There is no real nudity to report (save for some covered-up body models in the opening) and the language is friendly to viewers of all ages.  Sure there are a few juvenilely creepy vampire moments, but in all, this is definitely a title that will charm members of all age demographics.

The story goes something like this: Karin Maaka may seem like a perfectly normal teeny-bopper/ high school student with all of the usual dilemmas to keep her occupied: Dating, zits, anemia and the desire to bite into people's necks.

Sure that last one isn't that uncommon among the teenage set, keep in mind that our title character is in fact the middle child in a family of futuristic vampires who've made Japan their home.

As if being a vampire wasn't enough, Karin is a reverse vampire (or an ""un-vampire"" as the case may be).  This means that she doesn't rely upon sucking the blood of others to live but rather makes her own supply just like the rest of us.  Before you start to wonder if you are in fact a vampire as well, her condition is unique in that she makes too much of the red-stuff and has to bite others to get rid of some of her own.

Here's the catch, Karin literally has to get rid of her excess corpuscles or risk volatile nose-bleeds as her body rids itself of the extra blood.  The good news is that her victims don't suffer from the bite/ injection but actually feel revitalized and refreshed (a trick that I'm forced to reply upon Red Bull to duplicate).

Another interesting facet of her ""condition"" is that the mood of those surrounding her has a distinct effect on her body's blood affinity.  In other words, Karin's body starts working in overdrive in blood production when she's around miserable people (good thing she doesn't live around here).  As such, the poor girl is often found doing all she can to try to better the moods of those around her.

Following in the footsteps of such classic shows as The Addam's Family or The Munsters, a lot of Karin's appeal comes from the fact that her family life is, for all facts and circumstances, surprisingly normal.  Karin shares room and board with a brother, Ren and sister Anju with some fairly stereotypical parents (think protective father and quick-to-butt-in mother).

While her family may play the more traditional vampire role, Karin herself (don't forget she is an un-vampire) lacks some of the typical traits such as vulnerability to sunlight, night vision, and the ability to erase memories.  Yes she has the fangs but that only inhibits her on class-picture day.

The show itself just plain works, partially because Karin is a lovable lead character and partially because the whole vampire angle adds a nice element of mystery to the typical high-school comedy genre.

The show is as much High School Musical as it is Twilight and that's not a bad thing.  The heavy load of hiding the fact that she and hers are technically members of the ""living dead"", teen romance, high school shenanigans, and a whole lot of coming of age in the modern world spruces things up.

Perhaps its greatest strength is how tastefully and humorously the context manages to parallel Karin's unique blood dilemma to the budding menstrual cycles of all girls of similar age.  As such many of the situations and tense moments have an inherent scale of relatability and realism.

Karin's biggest weakness comes in the form of the art and animation, which isn't anything spectacular.  Not that either actually take away from a viewer's ability to enjoy the smooth pacing and just plain fun prose, the backgrounds and character models are nothing spectacular either.  The fan-service that managed to cause a bit of a reputation in the manga source-material has pretty much been eliminated entirely in the transition to anime (again except for the opening sequence, which hints toward much more risqu material than the show ever delivers).

The sound track is a mixed bag as well with upbeat pop numbers and smooth instrumentals that perfectly accent the teeny-theme of the show but the English dub isn't one of the strongest out there.  Like the visuals, the dub work is passable but not quite the butter-smooth masterwork that is so common with Funimation properties.

In all, this is a fun show that manages to capture the small moments of teenage life and blend them with a fictional backdrop nearly perfectly.  Because the writers initially decided to add a unique twist on the vampire theme, Karin ends up being one of those rare shows that will hold viewer interest regardless of their personal genre tastes.

8344948,3,B001US3XV4,"While I've grown up with and always considered myself a fan of anime, there still remains a great many series I've yet to watch. So I've been slowly chipping away at a rather long ""to watch"" list. Years ago, I remember browsing the shelves at the bookstore and coming across an interesting-looking series called ""Chibi Vampire"". The premise sounded interesting enough, though for whatever reason, I never got to read it. But upon recently discovering the manga received an anime adaption, I easily marathoned the series in just a few days--curious to see what I had missed out on.

While it's far from perfect, this short little series is a fun watch that puts a new spin on the traditional vampire myths.

Karin Maaka is the middle child in a family of vampires who immigrated to Japan two centuries earlier. But unlike the rest of her family, Karin is an ""un-vampire"". She doesn't  feed on blood, but produces it. As a result, she's forced to bite others to expel the extra blood, lest she suffer exaggerated nose-bleeds. She also exhibits no normal vampire traits, and instead lives her life just as an otherwise ordinary teenage girl---being able to go outside during the day, eat normal food, and attend high school. However, the general peacefulness of her life is disrupted with the arrival of a new transfer student, Kenta Usui---his presence of which makes her blood increase. It isn't long before Kenta discovers her true nature, and is soon recruited by her family to be her ally and guardian during the day. And she'll need all the help she can get, especially when a vampire hunter begins stalking her family--said vampire hunter's grandson falls head over heels in love with her (without knowing her true form), and when her grandma finds a spell that can turn her into a ""real"" vampire. Will Karin choose to change herself for the sake of making her family happy? Or is it really such a burden to be an un-vampire?

I'd probably liken this to an anime version of the Addams Family. Save for Karin's womanizing, cynical brother, all the characters are likeable, and each one gets at least one episode dedicated to them to flesh out their backstories a bit more. As weird as her family can be, they all greatly care about one another, and just want what's best for their daughter/sibling. Both Karin and Kenta have great chemistry together, and rather than falling into the ""love at first sight"" cliche, their eventual romance unfolds gradually over time. No matter how weird things get, Kenta always remains a polite gentleman, and has nothing but selfless reasons for keeping Karin's secret.  But then, about midway through the series, a rival is introduced; a boy named Winner who's the grandson of the vampire hunter that's after Karin's family. But being blissfully unaware of Karin's true nature, he immediately falls in love with her and does everything in his power to woo her. He, on the other hand, was super annoying any time he popped up, though thankfully, he became more tolerable towards the end of the series. And as a consequence, we get to learn more about this world's unique take on vampires--how they work, why they are the way they are, and how biting someone can actually be a helpful thing for humans, strangely enough (as doing so temporarily takes away their negative traits).

The series isn't without its problems, though. It's never explained why Karin's an un-vampire, and the series is left a bit open ended as to where Karin and Kenta's relationship will go, making me think that a second series might've been planned, but never came to pass. For how intricate the vampire lore gets towards the end, this is one series that, I feel, needed to be longer so important stuff could be given more time to develop. The main vampire hunter after the Maaka Family doesn't even show up until the last five episodes, and his subsequent defeat is wrapped up far too easily and quickly.

But then again, it's clear this series was aimed more for the romantic comedy vibe, and that's perfectly fine. I just feel that, with a bit of tweaking and another season, this could've taken the extra leap from being just a good show, to a great show. Still, it was a fun and interesting ride from beginning to end, with the age old moral of learning to love yourself, no matter how ""different"" you may be. Give it a watch next time you want to get in the Halloween spirit.",1501804800,,4395,4.722294654498044

8344952,5,B001US3XV4,"... Or so says Karin, a teenage high school girl who hides a secret: she comes from a family of vampires! However, she holds an even greater secret: she's actually an un-vampire who creates blood rather than drinks it, forcing her to expel the excess blood into a human once a month, otherwise she has an enormous nosebleed! This anime is loosely based off of the manga series ""Karin"" (called ""Chibi Vampire"" in America) and the escapades that ensue due to her ridiculous state.
Visuals: 10/10
This anime has some impressive animation, and the animators put a lot of work into the series. For example: at every episode midpoint there are animations that close for a commercial break and lead back into the show. These are completely unique: once you see one, you will never see it again, as it will be replaced by something entirely new next episode. The show utilizes a bright color palette, making for a very pretty experience. The opening of the anime is strange though, as it shows Karin in some VERY er... strange positions that we NEVER see in the actual show. This anime is probably not safe to show the kids, especially with the content of some of the episodes.
Audio: 9/10
I watched this show with the English dub, and I loved it. I love the voices of Karin and Usui (he sounded exactly like I imagined him in my head). There is also a new character that is only in the anime series, Winner Sinclaire, whose English voice is SO BAD that it's actually good. You have to hear it to believe it. Music wasn't very memorable except for the show's opening theme, Scarlet, which is very very catchy.
Story: 7/10
The story of the anime is basically fluff, and it doesn't do the original manga justice at all. Still, as a standalone, it's not bad. Winner's presence allows for a lot of comic relief, and the plot is almost completely different than the manga. I like to think that the anime takes place somewhere in the middle of the manga, even though that would set up a bunch of continuity errors.
Overall, the only other thing I seem to have a problem with is the price. $90+?!?! This anime is almost as big an offender as Read or Die: the TV, which is very pricey due to the packaging, content, and the fact that it's been out of print for a long time. Still, I bought the new box set for Martian Successor Nadesico for only about $40, and that had 26 episodes, a feature length movie, AND an OVA, along with some never-before-seen bonus content. So if you want to spend the $90, that's your choice, as it is a high quality anime, but it is available in singular formats, and that might be cheaper.
Overall Score: 8.5 nosebleeds / 10

8344954,4,B001US3XV4,"Karin is the oldest daughter in a family of Vampires. She has a strange deformity. Instead of sucking blood when she gets near her a person with her preferred blood type, Karin produces blood. Mostly it gushes from her nose. She actually can give her extra blood to humans and it gives them a positive experience. She meets a boy in school, Usui, who she develops a crush for. She wants to get close to him and have a relationship, but when she gets too excited around him she bleeds through her nose profusely.

This anime has a very fun and playful vibe. The characters and situations are funny and very entertaining. It's almost your typical high school romance/comedy. The Un-Vampire twist makes it quite different. My only complaint with this anime is the production quality. The animation isn't very detailed, and a little bit blurry. Especially in the character outlines. I do like the character designs and coloration though. My other issue is the bad voice acting. Most of the characters sound stoned or drunk. It takes a lot away from the series. I've listened to the English and Japanese tracks. They are both kinda bad. If you can deal with the sub par animation and bad voice acting, this series has a fun story. I have seen the prices on amazon and it's not worth it. I got it on e-bay for a whole lot cheaper. If you decide to try it out, I suggest watching it online or renting it before you buy.",1356048000,3,1412,4.515625
8344955,4,B001US3XV4,"While this is really a great series, the pricing is really ridiculous.  I don't know why these resellers think they can price these series so high. Probably because they are the only ones affiliated with Amazon and so they don't think they have any competition.  We've seen this kind of outrageous pricing with other classic series like Macross: Super Dimensional Fortress and others.

BUT there is almost always a very reasonably priced alternative IF you know where to look.  The complete 24 episode collection of this series is available now from another source for a very, very reasonable price. Just check out Lake Anime dot com to find reasonably priced alternatives.  In most cases these are new releases of these older series.",1334966400,,734,4.983606557377049

I will wait until the price goes down, but i doubt the sellers will do that. I rather not pay 300% more of what the original cost was suppose to be. I understand that its ""discontinued"" but it doesn't mean that you should rank up the price to make a buck. This is pretty much the only place i can get the box set and if i have to i would pay the over expensive amount, but its not fair to the buyers.",1329264000,,505,3.7735849056603774
