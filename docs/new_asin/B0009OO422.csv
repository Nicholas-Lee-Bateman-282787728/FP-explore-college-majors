8064422,4,B0009OO422,"One of the hallmarks of the Canadian television series ""Road to Avonlea"" (which aired on the Disney Channel south of the border as ""Avonlea"") was that it attracted an impressive array of guest stars for a show that was ostensibly a children's program.  On this videotape along you have Faye Dunaway, Diana Rig, Maureen Stapleton, and Robby Benson.  Other episodes feature Michael York, Stockard Channing, Kate Nellgian, Peter Coyote, and Madeline Kahn.  A couple of guest stars, Christopher Lloyd and Dianne Wiest, won Emmys for Outstanding Guest Stars for their performances on the show.  Nobody on this tape actually won, but Stapleton was nominated, so keep that in mind as you watch the other episode first.

Episode 50, ""The Disappearance"" (Written by Deborah Nathan, First aired March 28, 1993) finds that Lady Blackwell (Rigg) has arrived in Avonlea search for her nephew, Jonathan Ravenhurst Blackwell (Benson).  Meanwhile, Sara (Sarah Polley), is sick and tired of hearing her future planned by Aunt Hetty (Jackie Burroughs), so she decides to be a writer and goes off to interview Gerald Young, an antique dealer, who turns out to be the elusive younger Blackwell.  There is some business involving antiques that may or may not be stolen, and may or may not be fake, and Gus Pike (Michael Mahonen) gets blamed for things he did not do, so all things considered this episode is a mess.  Having praised the guest stars on this show I have to say that Benson does nothing for this role and, even more surprisingly, Rigg is given nothing to do with her role.  There is nothing wrong with having these special guest stars, but the best episodes of ""Road to Avonlea"" have to do with the characters growing up (even the older ones) and nothing along those lines happens in this one.

Episode 76, ""The Daring Deception of Maggie MacPhee"" (a.k.a. ""What a Tangled Web We Weave,"" Written by Marlene Matthews, First aired March 1995) begins with Felix (Zachary Bennett) thinking about running away because Hetty has failed him and he has lost his job at the White Sands Hotel.  Everybody there is all excited about the royal wedding to take place between Count Marek (Peter Outerbridge), the son of the Countess Polenska (Dunaway), and Adele, the sister of Pierre LaPierre (Albert Millaire).  Then Pierre and Adele's mother, Maggie McPhee (Stapleton) shows up and it becomes clear that she thinks her son owns the hotel and that the Countess thinks Adele is from a wealthy family.  Is anybody in this one telling the truth about anything?  Even Hetty King is going along with the lies trying to keep everybody happy before the big wedding.  At least Alec (Cedric Smith) is able to get Hetty to allow Felix to graduate, so things are not a total loss because the regular characters are again relegated to supporting (if not standby) roles.  At least Stapleton and Dunaway are given some fun moments, so I can justify rounding upon on this videotape (but just barely).",1137888000,3,2964,4.874501992031872
8064423,5,B0009OO422,"The common denominator of these two episodes from ""Road to Avonlea"" are the romantic dreams of Felicity King (Gema Zamprogna) brought back down to earth by Gus Pike (Michael Mahonen).  If you have read Lucy Maud Montgomery's two books ""The Story Girl"" and ""The Golden Road"" by Lucy Maud Montgomery, from which most of the characters of ""Road to Avonlea"" were taken, then you recall that despite her snobbish pretensions and high airs, Felicity King was fated to end up marrying the poor boy who worked on the King family farm.  However, the series created a new character to be Felicity's intended and we see two pivotal episodes in their relationship on ""A Fine Romance.""
From the show's second season, ""How Kissing Was Discovered"" begins with Janet King's Great-Aunt Eliza coming for a visit and turning the King household upside down. Meanwhile, Alec discovers that playing cricket is not as easy it was when he was a younger man and Felicity has her eye on a young cricket player on the visiting team. After all, she is now all grown up (she is almost a teenager) and has decided it is time to receive her ""first kiss."" However, Sarah and Felix have made a new friend in Gus Pike, a young sailor recently arrived in Avonlea and looking for work. Alec lets Gus stay in his barn and while Felicity will not give the boy the time of day, it is clear that he finds her rather interesting.  However, Felicity is too caught up with her romantic illusions to take notice of a mere hired boy.
""The Dinner"" (a.k.a. ""Felicity's Grand Design""), from the show's fourth season, finds Felicity urging her parents to go out and have dinner at the White Sands hotel so that she can take advantage of their absence to invite Gus to the King home for a nice, quiet little dinner.  Meanwhile, Olivia and Sarah try to set up a romantic dinner between Aunt Hetty and Clive.  Of course you know how well the best-laid plans go in Avonlea and this episode is no different.  The best moment, however, comes between Gus and Alec, who feels honor bound to explain his intentions to Felicity's irate father.
Although never quite as touching as the relationship between Gus and Aunt Hetty, the romance between Felicity and Gus was one of the major plot lines of ""Road to Avonlea"" as soon as he showed up in town.  Any time we got to see Felicity try to act more grown up than she really was (remember her making the fancy gown to be introduced at the formal ball?), it is usually fun.  Then there is the way that she can do no wrong in Gus's eyes.  This really is one of the better love stories I have seen on television and if you have not seen how it all ends then check out the ""Return to Me"" video from this series of the best of ""Road to Avonlea.""",1087603200,5,2728,4.461847389558233
