than ever. The show was always funny to
watch back in the 90's and it's still a funny show
to watch now. After all we have been waiting along time

3727677,5,B001O4KBMS,Remember the mid-nineties when Prince wore banana-yellow hot pants and lace? Back when he called himself TAFKAP? Eddie Griffin is great at impressions and one of the best Prince impressions you'll ever see. He is also a very underated comedian. How can you not love Malcolm Jamal Warner? Together they have great chemistry and a lot of fun. This was the best comedy ever on UPN. Don't pass this one by.,1247961600,6,402,4.676056338028169

3727749,5,B001O4KBMS,"This series ended way to soon. Malcolm is the cool, in control, let's think things out guy. Eddie is the let's just do it. Never thinking things out. They both are hound dogs (look it up younglings). They will both go after the same woman without knowing it. Since they are co-owners in a night club this leads to some very interesting and funny scenes.

SEASON 1

I remember back when this show was on TV and I loved it. Of course I bought this box set when it was released and recently bought a copy for my brother. It has been years now since this was released and I  need the rest of the seasons released. It has been too long and they need to put them out, maybe on that made on demand thing like the Warner Archives. This is one of my all time favorite shows.

The show was about two friends who live together just trying to make it. Malcolm and Eddie obviously as it is the shows title. Eddie is a tow truck driver with his own business and Malcolm works at a radio station. They dream of living a better life but all attempts at that dream always lead them into trouble, most of the time caused by Eddie. Eddie of course is played wonderfully by Eddie Griffin, absolutely the best thing about this show. Malcolm of course is played by Malcolm-Jamal Warner whose character is annoying but it works.

This first season is excellent and gets better as the show goes on. This may be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen it but they do eventually win the lotto and end up buying not only the bar in their building but the building as well. Before and after that event this show is hilarious. I really almost forgot how much I loved this show and it makes me sad to know that the rest of the seasons haven't been released. I would have loved for this box set to have had some commentaries on the episodes but I am happy to at least have this first season. I highly recommend that you pick this up.",1523836800,,1560,4.172757475083056
