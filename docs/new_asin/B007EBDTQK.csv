5079408,5,B007EBDTQK,"Amazon sent me instead of the British mystery that I had ordered this well written, directed and fabulously acted mystery/period drama that is in Swedish (with, of course, English subtitles) ""Anon1790"". Since I own many British mysteries, I decided to give a Swedish version of the genre a try.

On five (5) discs with two (2) episodes each that run about an hour and one-half per episode, ""Anon 1790"" follows the exploits of former Swedish  army surgeon closeted revolutionary against the powers in Stockholm Johan Dode who becomes a sort-of ""double agent"" becoming police commissioner in Stockholm.  Dode as police commissioner and his drunkard and skirmish ""sidekick"" solve some horrendous and gruesome cases on the streets and in the houses of Stockholm in 1790 while constantly fighting petty jealousies and the ""self importance"" of the so called upper classes and also fighting being exposed for desiring the overthrow of a corrupt ruling class.  Stockholm in 1790 is shown as a rather crime ridden filthy place--there are scenes that made me squirm.  Dode with his extreme dedication and sympathies for the down-trodden ""under-class"" solves some really nasty cases with sometimes some bloody and gross methods--be aware there are very graphic scenes.

I really enjoyed all of the episodes in ""Anon 1790"" because they all are splendidly directed, written and acted plus the era is so well recreated (rats and all).",1334534400,4,1420,5.179039301310044
5079409,5,B007EBDTQK,"ANNO 1790 is a captivating series that I look forward to watching each night.  The stories are well told with just the right amount of intrigue, suspense, history, politics and restrained romance mixed together.  It's also beautiful to watch, as the scenery, sets and costumes capture life in Stockholm in the 18th century. The subtitles are accurate,well placed and easy to read.  I don't want the series to end!",1334361600,9,413,4.956521739130435
5079410,5,B007EBDTQK,"The intriguing ""Anno 1790"" defies description -- it is part mystery, part historical drama, part romance and partially a look at early forensic science.  It is taut, fast-paced and beautifully crafted.  The setting is Stockholm when Europe is in turmoil a few years after the French Revolution.  In wonderful period detail we meet artistocrats, functionaries, citizens eking out a living and revolutionaries intent on social change.  Enter Daadh, an educated man of the Enlightenment, with one foot firmly planted in the future.  He acutely observes and processes the changing world around him.  He is of the Age of Reason, yet his heart usually gets the best of him.  Daadh is an oddity and therefore suspect among those in power above him and those socially below him.  Circumstances hand him an unlikely acquaintance named Freund, an erstwhile man of God and erstwhile moral compass for Daadh.  Freund's sensitivity and apparent internal struggles humanize him, making Freund a very sympathetic character.  Together the two are a fascinating pair of heroes, forming a tentative bond of friendship and dependence that deepens over the course of the show.  Throw in a smart, beautiful and unavailable woman to create a tense romantic angle to the story and ""Anno 1790"" becomes a series that offers something for everyone, especially those that appreciate artful storytelling.  I can't think of anything comparable, making this an excellent drama in a class by itself. Hopefully there will be future seasons of ""Anno"" that continue the fascinating journey of these characters.",1334102400,24,1576,5.26
5079411,5,B007EBDTQK,I felt the lessons learned from the way life was portrayed in its politics and ignorance was superbly presented.  A good series delicately concluded in the last episode.  A dvd worth watching or historical 'accuracy' and presentation.  Well done.,1407110400,,246,5.256410256410256
5079412,4,B007EBDTQK,"This miniseries is an excellent portrayal of political and personal life in Sweden shortly after the French Revolution. The writing and filming are extraordinary, and the characters compelling.  There is more graphic violence than I care to see, but the many excellent qualities of the episodes helped me bear with that shortcoming.",1389312000,,332,5.384615384615385
5079413,5,B007EBDTQK,"It's a year after the French Revolution, and a war between Russia & Sweden has just ended. Peter Eggers plays Johan Gustav Daadh, an army doctor, who returns to Stockholm with his friend Simon Freund, tutor to the children of the lovely aristocrat Magdalena, his boss's wife. Daadh is at once doctor and criminal inspector. The series is an exciting exploration of the fear and thrill of revolution, of religious freedom and atheism, of the sociology of crime, corruption, and class structure, poverty, wealth, love and love of justice. Highly recommended.",1388620800,3,556,5.1208791208791204
5079414,5,B007EBDTQK,"This is a must watch for anyone who likes historical dramas, mystery, family relations, and just generally excellent TV. How they solved crimes without our modern day technology is fascinating, and uh, very gross at times. One of the best episodes (number 8) is a thrilling look at how unwanted pregnancies were handled back then, and the very scary repurcussions of ""dealing"" with one.",1387756800,3,386,5.046875
5079415,5,B007EBDTQK,"Every aspect of this production, including photography, is first class, and the historical setting is very convincing. Highly likeable and easy to endorse!!",1385769600,2,156,5.826086956521739
5079416,4,B007EBDTQK,"Very , very fine acting, sets, costumes, direction, plots.  Actually, I like everything about the series!  It's most amazing and different, the subtly of the acting is wonderful, and the combination of Swedish, French and English, when appropriate given the charater, adds a very unusual essence of authenticity, given Europe in 1790.",1384387200,2,334,5.403846153846154

5079418,5,B007EBDTQK,"I have rarely found  Swedish productions disappointing, and this continues the trend. The acting is superb, the depiction of Sweden in the late 18th Century is educational and I cannot do anything other than praise this series. Buy it - you will not regre it - plus it is something one can watch again, and pick up on missed detail !!",1374192000,3,334,4.475409836065574
5079419,5,B007EBDTQK,"This is a Swedish crime drama series set in 1790 in the Stockholm-Uppsala area. The dialogue is in Swedish with English subtitles, which adds to the realism of the period setting. There are ten episodes,",1365379200,,203,4.828571428571428
5079420,5,B007EBDTQK,"You can see in these episodes how frightened other royal houses were in the aftermath of the French Revolution, that's why such harsh tactics were employed to put down dissent.  The inclusion of French phrases would have been typical among the upper classes, French being as commonly understood at this time as English is today.  Some of the details in costuming caught my eye -- the dirtiness of people is very noticeable.  Our hero wears a long coat, like a heavy-weight duster, and as he strides down the dirty streets, we see how the mud and wet muck has totally soiled the inside of the coat, up at least a foot or two from its hem.  The 1790's were a dirty time, and you get that watching these people.  The outdoor shots are well thought out, we see the architecture and the lay of the land, and know for sure this is Sweden, not England.  One other thing the episodes point out is that people had no rights, they were at the mercy of a system that sheds no tears for the common man.  Last comment:  if you edge away from movies that have sex, you won't be pleased.",1361232000,,1072,4.351758793969849
5079421,5,B007EBDTQK,"Excellent in all respects.  Acting, historical authenticity, costumes,cinematography.  In Swedish, with English subtitles.  Peter Eggers is the new entry in my personal top-ten list.  He will be working in the US very soon.",1360540800,2,223,5.666666666666667
5079422,4,B007EBDTQK,"What's interesting about solving murders that long ago when we've come so far with our detective stories? Everything, that's what. Superior acting, beautiful photography with each frame like a painting, unusual cases for our doctor sleuth to solve. It took about two episodes to get me hooked, but hooked I got. I wish there were more Anno 1790s to look forward to but alas, it seems these 10 were it.",1358899200,3,401,4.742857142857143

5079424,5,B007EBDTQK,The stories are intriguing and wonderfully acted out. Also loved the fact that the series took place in the 18th century - very inventive and creatively presented. Hope a series two will be in the works.,1357430400,,203,4.666666666666667

5079426,5,B007EBDTQK,"I watched one episode on MHZ streaming and liked it so much I ordered the whole set. The setting is a time in a place I knew nothing about and it inspired me to learn some history I would not otherwise have been aware of. The characters are interesting and deep, without any stereotyping (except maybe Nordin.) The story kept our interest for the entire series. Very worthwhile.",1352764800,2,378,4.573529411764706
5079427,4,B007EBDTQK,"Before watching this show, I had absolutely no idea of Swedish history, the war between Swede and Russia, or the influence of the French Revolution on other People. I hadn't even thought about it.

After watching the show, I'm glad to say I've actually learned some of historical facts. Obviously, the purpose of the show is not a lesson in history.

The historical facts, combined with the criminal inquiries and a love story, make the show a unique one. The characters are well written, the actors good... What's not to like ?",1350432000,9,528,4.728260869565218
5079428,5,B007EBDTQK,"I purchased this series on a whim, and what a fabulous surprise watching this has been. Great stories, wonderful acting, gorgeous photography and the continuing surprise of watching a police procedural unfold in a most unexpected way.

5079429,5,B007EBDTQK,"This is a very enjoyable series and a breath of fresh air for those of use who survive on period drama.  Yummy characters and stories (if sometimes predictable).

FIRST, MY NEWSPAPER BLURB:

The Scandinavian film and TV invasion continues with this wonderful Swedish mini-series from MHZ Networks. A 10-episode police procedural-cum-political thriller set in Stockholm in 1790, it stars Peter Eggers as Johan Gustav Ddh, a physician-turned-police detective who uses logic and forensics to fight crime in an age when guilt was by association and confessions were obtained by torture. He's also involved with a pro-democracy movement brutally repressed by the King. From the terrific acting to the production values and the stimulating stories, it's pure heaven for TV fans.

IN MORE DETAIL
There are *no* spoilers here.

Ddh approaches each murder case -- the mysteries which are deliciously fun -- with patient, systematic investigations while his subordinate, a brutish ignorant sergeant, is content nabbing just about anyone for the crime and beating a confession out of them.

Ddh's superior, Carl Wahlstedt, is a supercilious official who fancies himself a man of the Enlightenment, peppers his conversation with French bon mots and is keen to show off his knowledge of literature and the arts. Yet he's contemptuous of the lower classes and patronizing two his beautiful wife Magdalena (the charming Linda Zilliacus), insisting she stay at home even though she wants to use her medical knowledge to work as a midwife for the poor.

Magdalena, as you'd imagine, is much taken with Ddh, and their very decorous, socially correct and asexual - if deeply felt, poetic and deeply romantic - flirting is thrilling to watch. (Ddh agrees to become the new chief detective dude only after he meets her.)

Some comic relief and a few fascinating lessons of theology are supplied by Ddh's assistant Simon Freund (Joel Spira) an alcoholic Pietist who'd rather leave justice in the hands of God.

The series also is filled with political intrigue: Ddh, an avowed republican, is caught in the middle between the repressive government and revolutionaries who want to use violence to seize power.

We are in Stockholm in 1790: It's been 14 years since American declared itself a republic and broke from the English King. More saliently, it's been barely a year since The French Revolution exploded on the scene. Every royal house on in Europe is nervous. Some repress the mob even more brutally, while others institute liberalizing reforms.

Wahlstedt and the other members of Stockholm high society boast, Sweden's King Gustav III is working hard to modernize and liberalize the nation: He abolishes torture and initiated economic reforms. At the same time, he repressed the parliamentarian reforms and advances in civil rights that came before him in a bid to restore absolute power to the throne.

For Wahlstedt, one of the most important jobs of the government is to stamp out any sign of dissent and to punish anyone who writes, speaks or preaches anything remotely republican. (Mention the French Revolution and you're likely to get arrested.)

Ddh's friends are spies and assassins in the revolutionary cause, while Wahlstedt and the entire police force are an extension of the King's power, a situation which creates terrific dramatic tension.

Can't say enough good things about this show.",1336694400,25,3290,5.208333333333333
8515162,1,B007EBDTQK,I see the 5 star ratings for this but we could barely get through two episodes and we pitched it out.,1521504000,,101,3.857142857142857

8515165,5,B007EBDTQK,"This is a thrilling, moving, romantic, series - one season only unfortunately, although they manage to leave the viewer with a fully satisfying ending that brings all of the threads close enough for a real or imagined continuation. It's set in Sweden in 1790 just following the end of the Swedish was with Russia, which left many soldiers and citizens ready for a revolution. The church is tightening control over the population, the hero - a doctor/police and his wounded war buddy, Freund, return to the home of Freund's former employer who insists they both stay until he is ready to resume his duties as their tutor. Murder, simmering revolution, unrequited love, religion, women's rights, all mix in a fascinating, atmospheric stew of originality. Nothing quite like it. I loved it.",1472169600,,787,5.015267175572519
8515166,5,B007EBDTQK,This series is very unique. A historical period piece in Sweden in the 1700's. The main character is a doctor who also solves murder mysteries. Very well done. Never seen anything like it. Sorry there was only one season.,1470268800,,221,4.6923076923076925
8515167,5,B007EBDTQK,"This purchase was a gift. When we watched this series some time ago we thought it was excellent.  The sets and outdoor scenes were beautiful and believable, with weather depicted as one would imagine--lots of snow, mud, the buds of spring, etc.  It was as though we traveled back in time. The acting was superb as well--all of the actors, not just the starring roles. With all our contemporary murder mysteries the investigators have amazing tools to use in solving cases.  Watching a crime being solved, with so few tools available, in 1790 was quite thought provoking.  The biggest disappointment is that Anno 1790 had just one season.  Why?",1424649600,,643,4.862385321100917
8515168,5,B007EBDTQK,"This series was visually pleasing and seemingly historically accurate. It was well acted with a good script and the character development demands your attention. The closest parallel I can think of is Nicolas Le Floch, which I also thoroughly enjoyed.",1420243200,,251,5.3
8515169,5,B007EBDTQK,great series !,1419120000,,14,4.0
8515170,5,B007EBDTQK,"Proving that Swedish Television executives are as clueless at their American counterparts, this superbly acted, beautifully photographed production was cancelled after just one season because ""it appealed to an older demographic than intended.""
  Just as other reviewers describe, Anno 1790 is a part police-procedural, part historical drama and part romance.
Cinematographer Geir Hartly Andreassen's moody and beautiful photography, bring the setting, gritty Stockholm after the French revolution and the Russo-Swedish War of 1788-90, to life.",1415577600,3,544,6.24
