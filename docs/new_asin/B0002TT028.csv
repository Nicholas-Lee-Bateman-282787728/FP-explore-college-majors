8031773,5,B0002TT028,"I called it the God father of recent Korean films, because No. 3 introduced for the first time some of the great new faces of Korean cinema.  Min-sik Choi(Old Boy, Chihwason, Shiri), Kang-ho Song(Sympathy for Mr. Vengence,Quiet Family, JSA, Memories of Murder) and Suk-kyu Han (Christmas in August, Shiri, Tell me something) were stars who started recent rise of Korean cinema.  At the time when No. 3 was made only well known actor or actress in No. 3 were Suk-kyu Han and Mi-yeon Lee.

The movie is hilarious.  To be honest, I did not like No. 3 when I first watched it in 1998.  It is strange and silly.  No. 3 requires multiple viewing to understand its subtle humour and great performances of its star line up.  Enjoy the movie that started all in Korean cinema.  No. 3 might as well be the first and the last movie in which Choi, Kang and Han come out together.",1165363200,5,867,4.477707006369426
