2247124,2,B0007WQGYA,"Okay, you can rent it if you want but it's really not worth that much trouble. There is really only one reason to even view this half hearted excuse for a film it's to get some background info on Gouki/Akuma. That's who this film is really about it shows you what happened to Gouki and Gouken in the beginning but that's hardly worth making a film about; in fact, we would have been better served if they had just revealed this information in the next rendition of the video game.

Enough of that here's the review breakdown.

On the animation, it tends to be real inconsistent. Some scenes are very detailed and clear while others have this wobbly bloated appearance to them that makes everyone look like they were being developed by a drunk.

The story is interesting but for those who know the mythos of Street Fighter there are some inconsistencies but those are forgivable to an extent.

The fights, this is street fighter after all that's what were watching if for right? Well sorry but I've been more excited watching a fight in Dragonball Z than this. Akuma is not presented properly and Ryu is given far too much credit. Oh and Ken lovers please don't waste your time. I've come to the conclusion that the Japanese just don't like Americans because each incarnation of Street Fighter makes Ken look worse and worse whereas in the originals he was presented as Ryu's equal.

Well that's my rant it's pretty weak and if you want to save yourself some cash read the following if you still want to watch the movie don't read any further.

The only reason to see this film is that you find out that Akuma/Gouki is actually Ryu's father. Though neither Gouki or Ryu are aware of it. Who's the mother? Gouki's master had a daughter and interestingly enough Gouki was a nice guy but he, Gouken, and Ryu come from a bloodline of fighters that are basically cursed. The danger of using the Dark Hado is that it exposes one's soul to dark chi which attracts demons. If one uses the dark hado for too long you will eventually be overwelmed by those dark forces and become possessed. Turns out Akuma was someone who at heart was good but wanted to be a great fighter so badly he didn't understand the full consequenses. Translation, he was a bit on the dense side.

There, now you know the good stuff you can skip the movie and go back to playing the video game.",1132358400,3,2358,4.4953271028037385
2247125,5,B0007WQGYA,"I don't see how it is possible to finish watching this film and not love it. It packs a lot more in the 45 minutes it has than most animated films do. The animation is incredible - a perfect blend of CG and hand drawn art. The story is great, it serves its purpose as turning on people to the Street Fighter games and giving vets reinforcement to their dedication to the series. The best Street Fighter animated film yet, this is a must buy for anyone with a remote interest in Anime or Street Fighter.",1131580800,,502,4.239583333333333
2247126,1,B0007WQGYA,"I just finished watching it. Being a die hard Street Fighter fanboy, I buy mostly anything that's Street Fighter related, that goes for all video games, movies, anime, cartoons etc. etc.

Street Fighter Alpha The movie up to this point being the worst, and that said I hated it.

However Street Fighter Alpha Generations in my opinion is one of the WORST anime's i've ever seen. IN My opinion even making the ""original"" Street Fighter Alpha movie look good. Was that there goal in the first place?

Anyways wow did I hate Street Fighter Alpha Generations. I hated the story, I hated the character development... and if it hasn't been mentioned enough.. That art was completely disgusting... as well as the animation.

ooh yeah and the fight scenes were vary awful too in my opinion.",1130889600,14,782,4.770370370370371
2247127,5,B0007WQGYA,"I have to disagree with some of these people. I mean, I've played just about all the SF game and watched all the SF anime. I can't quite say I collect the comics, though, I should. Anyways, I'm quickly going to number the reasons that I like SFA:Generations. Here they are:

1. I myself liked the animation

2. I liked that it was only 45 mins. long, unlike some of the other anime that's too long and so it drags. This SF anime gets right to the fighting.

3. Sakura actually gets to fight. AND, with Ryu, how cool is that.

4. Akuma and Ryu fight. It's awesome. Not too long of a fight and not too short.

5. The story, while not that progressed, still was awesome how it showed the struggles against the Dark Hadou between Ryu's master's master, Ryu's master and Ryu (hence the name Generations.)

The only disappointment I might slightly have is that Ken didn't get to fight. But, other than that, I enjoyed this SF.",1130889600,2,920,4.350877192982456
2247128,1,B0007WQGYA,"Having been a street fighter fan for some time collecting comics DVDs and nearly all the games whilst never once complaining - i guess it finally had to happen! this was the most disappointing street fighter of them all. Instead of continuing from street fighter alpha to street fighter alpha 2 we are presented with a 45 minute piece of trash prequel which is obviously not aimed at any street fighter fan. The animation is the worst I have ever seen from Japan and I am disappointed i will have to add it to my manga collection. The story does not also seem to be sticking to the street fighter script with Ryu and Ken switching their personalities around and ken being the calm, concerned angry martial artist and ryu the one mucking around and goofing off. The fight scenes although are ok are brief - especially the intro with Gotesku and where was the fight with Gouken and Akuma?
Also
- what the hell was up with those blue dots coming out when Ryu & Akuma fight
- what was up with fireballs being thrown around like dragonball
- who the heck was the old man? Is it the same dude that was in Street Fighter V for 1 episode when Ken Ryu & Chun Li go Shopping?
- why was ken even in it for all of 3 mins
- why are japan taking a step back with this lame animation that even i can do better than - you look at Ghost in the shell 2 animation and then street fighter alpha generations and you think oh my god!
Believe me when i say rent this rather than buy,

And for the guy giving this 5 stars, you obviously was excited as me before the release date.",1130803200,10,1561,4.186046511627907
2247129,1,B0007WQGYA,"What the hell was that lol, i just finished watching all 45 mins of the film, if a film you could call it, and crap would be putting it lightly. Let me start by saying im a big street fighter fan and i loved street fighter II and especially Street fighter alpha for its storyline as well as the fight scenes, but this was one of the worst things ive ever seen.

The plot was rediculous, there was absolutly no point to it, there was very little story to be honest it was mainly about Akumas younger days and then fastforwarded to ryu who wanted to fight him to avenge his masters death, and thats about it, really that is it! The fights were BORING, if it wasn't in slowmotion then there was someone talking during the fight or there were cutbacks to other things, also they did not last long enough. The only one i found ok was Ryu vs the old man who i think was Gotetsu, even though Akuma is supposed to have killed him??!! The animation wasn't too bad actually i thought it looked quite smooth although Akuma looked sh*t, the voice overs were wrongly cast for the most part, the old man (gotetsu) sounded ok. And 45 mins thats not a film some cartoons are that long, the whole thing seemed rushed the story was written by someone who just did not know anything about street fighter ( or just didn't care). *spoiler* o ye n during the Akuma Ryu fight all these spirits start popping up around the land, what was that all about lol.

One thing i did like though was when akuma killed Gotetsu you saw the heavens symbol (symbol on Akumas back) in the sky made by a parting of clouds, that i thought was kool.

All in all a very bad film, i really am disappointed, they should have countined it on from where alpha left off, and used the sam writter/director.",1130716800,3,1758,4.289156626506024
2247130,1,B0007WQGYA,"what a shame!!!street fighter fans waited for around 3 years for this movie to come out and in the end u get to watch 45 mins of total bull.thats nothing surprising considering the fact that the first street fighter alpha sucked too.don't want to say anything more you watch it yourself and judge.want some darn good street fighter anime??go for street fighter II v instead,u will know the difference between good and crap....",1130284800,8,426,4.8493150684931505

In a quest to become a true martial arts master, Ryu sets out to hone his street fighting skills and to deliver himself from haunting legacy of the Dark Hadou.

You people will miss out on a lot if you don't go see this movie, its the best in the universe.",1127779200,,395,4.337837837837838
2247152,1,B0007WQGYA,"Wow, was I disappointed in this movie.  I really really wanted to like it, as I am a hardcore Street Fighter fan.  This movie had so much potential that it never reaches... I almost feel like the creators made this movie strictly with the thought that it would do well just because of the SF name, and didn't care about the quality.

The artwork and animation is very substandard for an anime, and can't even come close to comparing to SF Alpha the movie.  In fact, when I first saw Ryu, I wasn't even sure if it was Ryu that I was looking at.  I quickly picked up that it was him based on his actions, but I should be able to tell who Ryu is right away, considering how much I love SF plus he is my favorite character.  I don't understand why the animators changed the character design from SF Alpha the movie, especially considering that this is SF ALPHA Generations.  SF Alpha the movie had very good character art, and the characters looked nearly identical to their video game counterparts.  Akuma* looked much more menacing in Street Fighter Alpha the movie.

Another weakness in this anime is that it revolves nearly exclusively around Ryu and Akuma.  The only other Alpha characters that are in this are Sakura and Ken.  And even though Ken is a very important character in the SF universe, he has a smaller role than Sakura does... in fact, his role is so small, it might as well just be a glorified cameo appearance.

Not to give away any details, but Ryu is encountered by a mysterious old man who challenges Ryu to a fight.  Ryu is defeated rather easily... and only one question comes to mind at this point, ""If Ryu can't even defeat this old man, then how in the world is he supposed to take on Akuma, the most powerful character in the SF universe?""  Well, Ryu supposedly trains at this old man's house, we get about 1 minute's worth of him training... and I suppose that is supposed to be enough to imply that he got stronger than the old man and can now take on Akuma.

If all else weren't bad enough, the fight between Ryu and Akuma seems mindless.  They just seem to blindly throw ki attacks at each other to see who can topple who.  There doesn't seem to be any real rationality in why they are doing what they are doing.  Did the animators think this would make them appear to be super powerful?  If they did, then they failed miserabely.  Because at no point in this movie, did either Ryu or Akuma do anything to make me believe they are the two most powerful SF characters, which they are supposed to be.

The voice dubbing is pretty bad... it's not as bad as SF 2 the Animated Movie's was, but it isn't nearly as good as SF Alpha the movie's was.  By the way, this anime seems very rush as it is only about 45 minutes long.

All I can say is that this movie and story had so much potential.  I almost don't even want to consider it a SF movie... oh by the way, for those of you who have seen SF Alpha the movie, but not this, I want to say that this movie is NOT a continuation of that movie.  I bring this up because in SF Alpha the movie, we are left with a seen of Ryu and Akuma meeting face to face, and then they are about to engage in combat before the movie end... this is not where Generations picks up... I wish it were, because anything would be better than this.

So in short: Low quality art/animation, only four Alpha characters, mindless fighting, and bad voice dubbing... and the topper for me, I couldn't even tell you who won the fight between Ryu and Akuma if I wanted to... you'll have to see the movie for yourself to know what I mean about that.

Hopefully the next time a SF anime is made, the creators will actually put in some type of effort to make it a worthwhile purchase.

*In Generations Akuma is called by his Japanese name, ""Gouki"".  I have no idea why the English dubbers kept his Japanese name, instead of changing it to Akuma... you'd think they would since in SF Alpha they called him Akuma.  Probably just another piece of evidence that they put absolutely zero thought into this movie.",1159056000,6,4046,4.306472919418758
2247153,1,B0007WQGYA,"Since Im' a fan of street fighter, i bought this dvd when i first saw it at a store. It's a waste of money. At least if they had thrown in a poster it would have had some value. You see Ryu and Akuma on the cover and you think"" these guys are going to fight!!Finally."" That's what i thought,after of course watching the first Alpha movie and them not fighting each other. But this movie was a complete gimmick to rake in some quick dollars at the expense of all the fans who were expecting so much more. The animation itself is pretty bad. The fight scenes are pathetic for this day and age. There is nothing memeroble about this movie. The only thing I can clearly remember is the scene when Sakura and the other girl are in the bath togather, and even then you don't see much. The other thing is Akuma looks terrible. They should draw him the way he looks in Capcom vs Snk 2. And what's even more annoying is they call him by his lesser known name ""Gouki"" throughout the whole movie. Anyone who is a fan of the franchise will have to see it to believe it, just don't expect much and whatever you do, don't buy it.",1145750400,4,1115,4.166666666666667

It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating.

2247157,2,B0007WQGYA,"Street Fighter Alpha was a decent, stand-alone action-oriented story. It presented a conflict and attempted to finish it. Why they decided to delve back into the Alpha story is beyond me, and if you asked me they did it in the wrong way. Not only does Generations not follow the Alpha Movie storyline, but it makes Ryu out to be a disciple again, a weakling who can't even defeat an old man. Upon leaving the Alpha Movie, we know that Ryu can definitely hold his own against any opponent. It seems to me that Generations attempted to be a stand-alone story as well, yet because of this, it makes the movie redundant.

The story follows the history of the Dark Hado with Gouki (a.k.a. Akuma) as he first begins to master the art, all the way up to when Ryu fights him and attempts to spurn the Dark Hadou himself. Ken and Sakura make an appearance, but their appearances are mostly pointless. Sakura provides a quick action scene, and Ken arrives late so that the old master can present the history of the Dark Hadou to him and us.

The action in this movie is decent, and the animation is somewhat reminiscent of Samurai Champloo. Without these, I'm sure I would have given this movie a one. If you're curious, rent it; it isn't worth paying the high price to own this turd. Otherwise, leave this movie alone.",1138752000,2,1309,4.495798319327731

2247159,1,B0007WQGYA,"Could this movie be any more horrible? Doubtful. So what was good about it? Well, the backgrounds were nicely painted. But other than that? Now, I've seen some terrible animes before. This has to be among the worst of the worse. I'll start with the artwork on the characters. Who did they hire for this job??? Sometimes it was decent. Sometimes. But other times the characters bodies aren't even proportionate. Especially the hands are way off. Did they hire first year art students to do this? Then there's the voice actors. Again, among the worst I've seen in animes. But it's not entirely their fault. The script they have to read from is terrible. The story is boring. I thought ""Street Fighter Alpha"" was bad. This was way worse. Even the American Van Damme ""Street Fighter"" movie was better than this.

As a fan of Street Fighter, I beg Capcom to stop allowing these people to ruin a great franchise. Either do it right or don't do it at all. I've never made a movie but I bet I can do better than ""Generations.""",1135987200,,1018,4.532608695652174
2247160,3,B0007WQGYA,"first of all, I would like to thank Managa for thier efforts

My rating will be as follows:

1- ONE STAR:

we liked Street fighter because we now it as non stop fighting but in this movie we learned that Akuma (Gouki) is there and there is a fighting between him and Ryu but what we saw in the movie is some blows we have seen beter than them in Fatal Fury or any week movie(Video game related)

the cover of the DVD shows a Great Animation Pic. while the animation in the movie is nice but week

the animation in Street Fighter Alpha is better and it was the best way to show the full stringth of street fighter I wich if i did not see the movie because it showed my how fragile is Gouki, when we saw Akum in Street fighter Alpha we was feeling his power in our bodies also as Viewers but here he is nothing

Sorry Managa to say that but i telt that is my duty as Street Fighter and Manga Fan because i Can draw stronger animation than this one

2- Five Stars:

I was very interested in the story, because any one who played street fighter we find that suddently akuma appears from no where and he is incredibly strong from where he came, now we know the story which have made the story more powerfull

for that weekness we feel that we paied our money in the air 28$ gone with the wind and Managa now have to satisfy all of Street fighters Fans with another DVD with new story with strong animations also

thank you all",1133481600,,1421,4.097472924187725
2247161,4,B0007WQGYA,"First off, let me say that as a diehard Street Fighter fan, I hated the first Alpha OVA.  Generations does a lot to remedy the problems with the first one, but as a film, it comes up a little short.

The animation is inconsistent with the backgrounds nicely drawn and detailed and the characters bland and uninspired.  Akuma in particular looks nothing like his video game counterpart; beady eyes and an ogre-ish-like body does not a demon warrior make.  The fight scenes are fast-paced and impressive like they should be, but are a bit short - and with the entire movie clocking in at just 45 minutes, it wouldn't have hurt to add in another fight or two.

I have to say that I admire Manga Video's decision to develop new characters instead of trying to throw in the entire Street Fighter cast and forcing a story out of them.  Generations' storyline naturally takes a few liberties in changing the series canon and centers solely on Akuma and Ryu.  Fan-favorite Ken Masters comes in for a scene near the end - literally two minutes - and I would've liked to see him given a more important role.

Finally, the question of whether to watch it subbed or dubbed.  If you're already a fan of anim, you know the answer to this one.  The dubbing is wooden and dry, but I was surprised with the fairly poor subbing quality as well.  You won't notice it at first, but often the Japanese voiceovers will continue with no subs, or there will be subtitles without anyone talking; the latter of which is probably just poorly timed to synch with the talking.

Overall, Generations is fun to watch.  If you're not a Street Fighter fan, avoid it.  If you are, it still might not be for you, but hey - you can always go back and play the classic, quater-munching game.  That's not so bad, is it?",1133222400,,1781,4.470588235294118

When arriving to his masters home, Ryu receives a visit from Gouki issuing him a challenge. Ryu now struggles with his purpose in life, and also faces the possibility of being taken over by the evil chi called the ""Dark Hado"", which resides in him, and is also what corrupted Gouki. -summary

When this movie first came out a some years ago. I remember setting my expectations very low. The reasons happen to be: 1) It's a video game to anime. Therefore, the red flag should automatically go up. 2) The first movie was a bomb. And 3) Outside of series with an already established storyline. I haven't seen too many anime movies with such a short length turn into anything special. Battle Angel, Neo Tokyo, and Voices of a Distant Star are the only real exceptions I can think of.

 Strangely enough, Street Fighter Alpha: Generations still managed to surprise me. Fortunately, the movie has gotten slightly better over time but it's still not a good one, no matter how you slice it up. This movie has been universally panned by almost ALL fans of the franchise. Albeit, some of their reasons are kind of ridiculous in some ways. Still, their anger and disappointment is understandable for the most part.

 Street Fighter Alpha: Generations is billed as the prequel to Street Fighter Alpha, and is based on the video game of the same name. I can't exactly put my finger on it just yet, but I just have a hard time buying this as a prequel. Anyway, the film already has enough issues so there's no real sense in searching deeper for more.

 One of the issues fans have with the movie is the different look. The characters really aren't faithful to their video game counterparts. The production team clearly went for an original design here. Personally, the new look has grown on me, and I really don't think it's all that bad. The characters have a more traditional anime look to them, and the character designs seem a bit more detailed. The backgrounds are also pretty nice with dark silhouettes blanketed by the rainfall. The soundtrack also fits very well giving most of the scenes a nice feel.

 Unfortunately, the problems are poured on as thick as tar here. The run time really does the movie in. The entire movie has a rushed feel. I mean everything is crammed in, and at least one character makes a completely unnecessary appearance. I have absolutely no problem with centering the story only on Ryu and Akuma. Since their rivalry is pretty much the most interesting one in the game, and you get a good amount of background on Akuma, but Ken is reduced to a side character in the worst way, and his cameo appearance was better off left on the cutting room floor. He was of no use here at all.

 The action scenes have some good animation and choreography at times, yet it was never taken to its full potential due to the time restraint. The final act was badly damaged. The writers decided to mesh the final battle with the back story narrative. This caused the two different segments to bounce back and forth, which resulted in an unfulfilling climax. The confrontation between Ryu and Akuma should be epic. However, this could easily rank as one of the worst encounters in Street Fighter. In addition, the constant use of the Dragonball Z-ish high energy attacks felt too non Street Fighter.

 I can't stress enough how much of a letdown Street Fighter Alpha: Generations turned out to be. I still can't wrap around my head how something so simple, could be so easily messed up. I do not for any reason recommend this to the casual anime fan. As for Street Fighter fans, step into this arena at your own risk.

It certainly seems that the pivotal main characters of this film was: Ryu, Gouki, Fuka, and the Monk.

They play the most important parts of this film.

Alot of people are saying the animation on this movie is bad but i think it is very creative and unique animation. Unfortunately, different and unique things in life usually get called bad or sucky instead of creative and innovative. I like that these animators didn't follow the crowd with their anime in this movie. I think its really cool how they made the characters look as simple as possible but then made all the backgrounds and atmosphere around the characters look super real and pop like a good color tattoo. As for the story, it is pretty different but it gives us street fighter fans a different way of looking at the characters we know and love. At the end of the day, street fighter is about good vs. evil and this prequel movie to alpha the movie delivers just that. As far as the old man in this movie goes, i think it was really cool to add some mystery to Ryu's origins. Thats what makes him such a likeable character.
