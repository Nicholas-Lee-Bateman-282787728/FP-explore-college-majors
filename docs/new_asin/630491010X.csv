938100,5,630491010X,"I love the 1970 movie Airport- it is my favorite. Yes, the film may move along slowly without much action, yes, it may have a soap opera feel to it, yes the costumes and hair designing may be thirty years old, but it still is a classic in the disaster films area. I recommend it for anyone that is interested in aviation. The technical details are excellent as well, except that the in-flight scenes are shot using a toy model Boeing 707, but it's not too bad. Helen Hayes, playing her role as Mrs. Ada Quonsett, the stoaway, is excellent and very convincing. Alfred Newman's theme music gives it a good touch as well. Also, I recommend Arthur Hailey's novel from 1968, Airport, from which the movie is based on. The book was recently re-printed in August 2000, so it should be easy to find a copy, or to order it right here on amazon.com. Thanks for reading my review, and enjoy the movie and book!",979257600,6,899,4.421686746987952

938102,5,630491010X,"OH MY GOD! DEAN MARTIN SOBER!!!!!
He didn't appear inebriated at all in  this film, and he really showed that he could be a damn fine actor. This  film started the ball rolling on what would soon becalled ""The  Disaster Genre"".
Produced in 1969, Jennings Lang could not have even  imagined what he was getting into. The film was one of Hollywoods shining  moments and usherd in the modern era of action/adventure/disaster films.  The effects were top notch, now a little cheezy, but I am sure that those  like me love it either way.
I did notice a few pilot tech flubs, such as  reaching for the flap handle by way of the gear lever(!). The flap actuator  was next to the thottle quads in the 707, not on the front panel where the  gear actuator is located.
Even from a pilots point of view, this film is  a must see. I would really like to see the directors cut of this film, as I  read somewhere a few years ago that the DC was 40 minutes longer than the  edition we see now.
Oh well, time will tell!
Excellent Filmmaking",965520000,2,1023,4.293193717277487
938103,5,630491010X,"of its kind.  I remember as a boy of thirteen going to the neighborhood theater and watching this movie and then seeing it on television many times.  If you have any interest in commercial aviation at all especially  airliners of the Boeing family, then you have to see this movie.  The cast  is star-studded (you'll remember many of them from your parent's day if you  are a boomer) and the plot grabs you from the get-go.
This movie was  made in a time when there wasn't a need for blood, guts, and gore to get  the point across.  The suspense in this film rivals any of today's  ""action/adventure"" flicks and still comes out on top.  There's no  way you won't enjoy this one. I just wish they made more films of this  caliber in today's market.  Enjoy!",964828800,2,755,4.416058394160584

It even inspired me to go into aviation. Even though I  was only 5 years old when I saw it at the movies, I still remember the  applause when Joe Patroni got that plane out of the snow. This is a  bonafide classic.",962150400,2,374,4.027027027027027
938105,5,630491010X,"After reading this book, and purchasing this movie, I am impressed.  I am a pilot, and the scenes of aviation are true if not archaic.  In today's standards, Hollywood shifts everything out of proportion.  However, if a  viewer wants a true insight to the thoughts and processes of a an aviator  or air traffic controller, this movie is one of the best sources.  What the  special effects lack, it makes up in depth and character.",951091200,3,430,4.653333333333333
938106,3,630491010X,"Although a very good movie, Universal and GoodTimes need their head examined for not showing the whole movie in widescreen.

938107,4,630491010X,"Inspired by Arthur Hailey's bestseller, ""Airport"" delivers a fair share of drama, thrills, and humor. Considering it's age, it is rather tame by today's standards.  Standing out among the cast is Helen Hayes as  the impish stowaway and Maureen Stapleton as the desparate woman trying to  stop her psychotic husband.  Both were nominated for supporting actress  Oscars, with Hayes winning. Also great are Dean Martin as the womanizing  pilot, Jacqueline Bisset as the beautiful stewardess, and George Kennedy as  the tough-talking maintenance chief.  With it's well drawn characters and  multiple plotlines, this old-fashioned thriller is sure to entertain all  ages.",939254400,,666,5.57
938108,3,630491010X,"I'll admit it: Airport is a guilty pleasure of mine.  It's a classic disaster film, spiritual father to all from the Poseidon Adventure to the present day.  We learn the stories of the people aboard a bomb-laden Rome  bound flight, and those on the ground fighting a blizzard and blocked  runway to get them home.  Characters are a little thin, a little  soap-opera-y, but better than many modern films.  Helen Hayes in  particular, is terrific in her Oscar winning role.  The DVD is of mixed  quality, a nice presentation of an un-remastered copy of the film.  Some  dirt and scratches are evident, but color and sharpness are fairly good.  Screen aspect shifts, usually cropped pan & scan, but occasionally  letter-boxed to preserve some wider shots.  Film length is misstated on the  box, at 136 minutes, not the 91 listed.

938211,3,630491010X,"A movie that was made long before I was born but it is still entertaining.  Very different of course to 80's and beyond airline disaster films.  This one spends a lot of time on a plane being bogged in the snow blocking the main (longest and safest) runway.  Along with a side story about an old lady who is serial fare evader (stoaway) and has been caught.  The airport manager also has a wife who doesn't care that he's dealing with a major incident affecting the livelihood and later in the movie lives of thousands of other people. It is obviously a bit dated, smoking on planes, in the airport, you can buy life insurance for a couple of dollars from women who are quite upfront about being in a competition for the more dollars of insurance they sell.

It's a fun enough view though, but probably more satisfying viewing experience for those who were around and saw it when it first came out for nostalgic reasons, or who can remember travel in this era.",1511827200,,960,4.462857142857143

938218,5,630491010X,"There have been a few disasters and monsters before this movie. However this is the one credited as the beginning of the airplay disaster movies. These have included some sequels and even the ""Air Plane"" spoofs
.
It is fun to look back at the different actors and remember or see them for the first time in a younger body.

The film has several overlapping and intertwining stories; some of the stories seem like soap operas.

A few mentionable scenarios are Mel Bakersfield (Burt Lancaster); airport manager is accused of placing his work before his family. He gets berated in the middle of a crisis by his probably to be ex-wife Cindy Bakersfeld (Dana Winter). Does he also get distracted by his beautiful and efficient assistant? Throw in a pilot playboy, Capt. Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) that is forced to evaluate fatherhood. For comic relief we have Ada Quonsett a geriatric stowaway. Then for the drama there is someone who has nothing to lose and everything to gain if the plane mysteriously does not reach its destination; the man with an attach case D. O. Guerrero (Van Heflin.)

I am not going to go through the whole story it is for fun if you get to speculate on what is going to happen. How ever I must say one of my favorite characters is Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) operations chief that is tasked with clearing the runway of a stuck 707. See him again as the corrupt lawyer, Uncle Andrew, in Agatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile.""",1505174400,2,1451,4.638132295719845

Somehow it all works and is actually entertaining. ""Airport"" was so successful when it was released it not only spawned several (increasingly ridiculous) sequels  and quite a few star studded disaster flicks that filled movie theaters back in the 1970's and '80's.  Burt Lancaster (who reportedly hated the movie) phones in his performance--but Dean Martin actually does well with his role and keeps the movie aloft.  George Kennedy as ""Petroni"" the TWA maintenance genius steals the picture.  (A side note--Kennedy's character is based on a real TWA employee).

This wasn't the kind of movie my Parents would have gone to see.  so I don't remember when I saw it for the first time.  It wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  At the time it was released it did huge at the box office and was up for a ton of Oscars.  Helen Hayes won an Oscar.  Burt Lancaster got top billing.  But to me the best performance was by Dean Martin.  It's a soap opera and opened the door for all the disaster movies that came later.  And all the airplane movies.

And then soon after a scene of Burt Lancaster answering a phone smack in the middle of the shot with white walls surrounding the scene; very BAD FRAMING! And then soon after that the split SCREEN with two cheesy scenes and two bad actresses!! It gets worse when a following scene has multiple split screens and it looks like The Brady Bunch and that sequence continues with a horribly written voice over of Burt Lancaster's character and his wife in various scenarios of their ridiculous life together...It gets better when Helen Hayes who plays a stowaway gets caught and there are some nice scenes to follow later in the film...Hey, it's fun but let's not get carried away!",1470787200,,942,4.514619883040936

938474,2,630491010X,"This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

Despite lots of emails and chats, never could get digital code to work.  I will spare you from all of the horrible details but the short version is the code provided was accepted by Universal Studios, I was then passed on to Flixter where the failure occurred.  Universal sent me a new code it also failed with Flixter.

The movie itself is 5 stars. My favorite character by far is George Kennedy.  There's a great scene where he applies full throttle to a Boeing 707 that is stuck in the mud. The 707 must be moved to clear the runway. After accomplishing this task his assistant says, ""The book says that was impossible"".  Kennedy responds, ""That's what I love about the Boeing 707..... it can do everything but read.""

As a frequent flyer, and someone whose motto has always been, ""If it ain't Boeing, I ain't going"".  I enjoyed that line very much.

I was pleased to find that the movie had aged well, so to speak. The acting was what you expect from the actors used--no bad ones in the bunch. Of course it was ""dated""--everything from the laissez-faire security of the airport (boy, I miss THOSE days), to the fact you could smoke, EVERYWHERE. Of course it is NOT ""politically correct"" thank goodness. It has worn well over time, though, and is worth watching again if only so you can show your children/grandchildren what things were like in the ""good old days"":

The politically correct parents can use this for tons of ""teachable moments""-- obvious sexism, out moded gender roles, stereotyping of all kinds.

The rest of us can enjoy a good, old, classic movie that had some real engineering skill involved in the making--yes, that those were REAL AIRPLANES they were playing with in the movie, not models or CG --before someone decides to ban it :-).",1451174400,7,1025,4.688888888888889

The ""disaster"" part of the movie is mostly suspense, and the action part at the end is very well done and believable.  Especially in the modern era with CGI effects of ridiculous heroics, this seems almost like an FAA training film.

The film may seem soap-operaish in its story lines, but primarily because it tried to give its characters some personal lives and that they might exist in a world beyond simply serving the plot of the film.

A lot of good actors and performances here.  Dean Martin shows he could play a real person when he felt like it.  Lancaster and George Kennedy are always great.",1439942400,3,708,4.624

Dean Martin and Burt Lancaster play successful career men but they sure are nasty to their wives.  Both wives are dumped and replaced by the end of the film.  Even in the middle of an emergency, Lancaster finds it necessary to ask for a divorce...right in his airport office.  We see the utter devastation in his wife's face, who tried to save it but he's a workaholic.  He's also fallen for his blonde assistant, played by Jean Seberg.  That character, 'Tanya' is wholly unlikeable and we've all known a Tanya, haven't we?  A real home wrecker.  Dean Martin isn't much better. As hot shot pilot of the ill fated jet, he is having an affair with Gwen, a flight assistant (played by Jacqueline Bisset).  I only gave it two stars for its flight control tower sequences and cockpit sequences which tried to be as realistic as possible.  and they are pretty good for a 1970 film.",1437177600,2,980,4.517045454545454

938693,3,630491010X,"So how did the likes of Burt Lancaster, Helen Hayes, Van Heflin, George Kennedy, Dean Martin, Jean Seberg and several other terrific actors get roped into this monstrosity? BIG BUCKS, that's how. Airport, the novel, had been a smash hit and so Hollywood came a callin' with huge dollar signs in its eyes.

But at any rate, this's one of  my all-time favorite ""B"" movies. Some of my favorite things about this movie are some of the very same things that this movie is slammed for. Examples:

The airplane cockpit the size of a living room, which you could imagine including a small wet bar in the back for Dean Martin's convenience.

Van Heflin's mad bomber who's about as menacing as your typical neighborhood florist.

Helen Hayes' patently over-the-top performance as a little old lady stowaway (it won her the Academy Award).

George Kennedy's hammy performance, which far out-shines his Academy-Award winning hammy performance in Cool Hand Luke.

And then there's Jean Seberg. If you've seen her in some of her other films, you know what a sexpot she can be. In this, she's totally sterile and asexual and dull. I swear that I saw this film about half a dozen times before I realized it was her. Unbelievable.

The total and complete lack of chemistry between the Burt Lancaster character and his on-screen elegant, gorgeous wife. You could completely care less as to whether or not they'll split up, because you're wondering how in the hell the nerd-schlub got together with Princess Grace in the first place. What a joke. (I just can't get over that Burt Lancaster character. Mr. Earnest to the Hilt. He's got Jean Seberg over one shoulder and the actress that plays his wife over the other shoulder and all he can think about is making sure that the planes land safely! Talk about cockeyed priorities.)

The television quality production values, including the immoderate use of split screens during the domestic strife segments, which make you feel like you're watching portions of episodes from The Patty Duke Show.

And those are just some of the things that this movie was slammed for.

Overall, this movie is dumb and stupid and poorly made. But everybody has their guilty pleasures, and this's one of mine. I like this movie a lot.",1432166400,3,2243,4.815104166666667

938739,3,630491010X,"You have to give this movie credit for being entertaining.  As many have noted here, ""Airport"" was the first of the blockbuster disaster movies, and as such paved the way for ""Towering Inferno"", ""Poseidon Adventure"", a lot of spoofs (the ""Airplane"" movies, which writer Arthur Hailey apparently had a hand in as well--give the guy credit for not taking himself too seriously), and maybe even a few odd offshoots like television's ""Love Boat"" and the notorious ""Stewardesses 3D"" movie.

There's a huge cast of notable actors in ""Airport"", and you have to believe that they took the project on much as the actors who appear in the huge comic book movies currently produced.  The actors knew it was going to be very successful, and the exposure would be good for their careers.  And, all of the actors involved acquit themselves very professionally, especially Dean Martin and Burt Lancaster.

They certainly weren't hoping for Academy Awards.  ""Airport"" sports a lot of actors and actresses that appear to be having bad hair days.  Jackie Bisset is has so much hair on her forehead that she's barely recognizable, and Jean Seberg looks to have borrowed a wig from Tippi Hedren.

The sets of the movie have an abundance of cheap wood paneling, the special effects of the 747 rising above and descending through the clouds are very primitive by today's standards, and the use of split-screen was taken to a ludicrous extreme--with a bubble appearing in the center of the screen.  These are the obvious reasons why the movie was parodied so devastatingly... and really, Leslie Nielsen could hardly have known that ""Airport"" would provide him with a second career as a comic actor.

""Airport"" was a salad so loaded with ingredients that the filmmakers hoped it would appeal to virtually everybody.  There were so many tragic and comic elements vying for attention that viewers were supposed to be bowled over, and forget that it was largely a melodramatic mishmash.

It's definitely a guilty pleasure--one of those movies that's outrageously bad in some aspects but still has an emotional pull that hooks viewers, and will keep them watching until the end.",1425600000,,2150,4.9748603351955305

The main idea in the movie is that its snowing and they have a plane stuck in the snow. The man that is emotionally upset  buys a ticket for anywhere. He boards the plane and waits for it to be up in the air and then blows himself up. So there is a big gapping whole on the plane and they have to turn around and land the plane back at the airport that they just took off from.

938912,5,630491010X,"This is the original air disaster.  Every airplane movie that followed could not match this fine direction and production.  With a cast of Jean Seberg,  Jacqueline Bisset,  George Kennedy,  Helen Hayes,  Van Heflin,  Maureen Stapleton,  Barry Nelson,  Dana Wynter,  Lloyd Nolan,  Barbara Hale,  Gary Collins,  John Findlater,  Jessie Royce Landis,  Larry Gates,  Peter Turgeon,  Whit Bissell,  Virginia Grey,  Eileen Wesson one could not go wrong.

The movie starts out by introducing the main characters; Burt Lancaster(always serious)as the airport manager, Dean Martin as the veteran pilot and his paramour; Jacqueline Bisset.  In the beginning Helen Hayes is seem walking into the airport.

The plot revolves around a distraught man(Van Heflin) who brings aboard the aircraft a bomb.  Too add to the suspense snow storms prevent Martin from landing at the nearest airport once the explosive is discovered.  Helen Hayes(Academy award winner) sitting next to the bomber is called to the cockpit were Martin tells her they know she's a stowaway but ask her to help.  She agrees to help but the bomber gets his briefcase back and detonates the device.  The suspense begins as Martin tries to keep the 707 airborne while his lover lies aft with an eye injury.

On the ground Lancaster fights with the local politicians to close a runway down that Martin needs.  The games begin as the cigar chomping Kennedy and crew work feverishly to remove a stuck aircraft and remove the snow.  All this occurring while blinding weather slows their progress.

No spoilers here.  The movie is well acted and can be taken seriously as we all know the dangers of landing in inclement weather.

Helen Hayes is a sweetheart and earns the respect of the crew and is awarded with a fee first class seat back to LA.

938973,5,630491010X,"Airport was a transition from the tense drama of ""The High and the Mighty"" almost 20 years before to a new kind of film. Airport is star-studded and the quality of the acting turns what could have been a somewhat cheesy plot into a tense drama speckled with just enough humor to break the tension.

This formula of lots of stars and a central plot split off into several individual stories would drive not only the future Airport movies, but 70s disaster spectaculars such as The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake and The Towering Inferno. Additionally, popular TV shows like The Love Boat and Fantasy Island drew inspiration from the format.

Burt Lancaster shines as a hard and competent airport manager pulled in all directions at once. George Kennedy provides drama and humor as the ground engineer. Dean Martin, Jacquelyn Bisset, Jean Seberg, Van Heflyn, Maureen Stapleton and a host of others filled out a solid and believable cast.

The movie was completely stolen by Helen Hayes, who played a septuagenarian serial stowaway with spunk and humor. Her courage almost saved the day, but was prevented from success only by the plot. LOL

Airport was based on a best selling novel by Arthur Hailey, who used the same style of story for other best selling books such as Hotel.

This is the way movies are suppose to be...something that has a little bit of everything, love, romance, tension, excitement, and a tragic end for some poor haunted soul. This is a fun movie to watch because it is so good on so many levels, and it's a great movie to watch with your family -- there's little swearing and everyone keeps their clothes on! Other than the affair between Captain Demerest and flight attendant Gwen Meighen there's nothing scandalous to explain to small kids. Maureen Stapleton's performance as Inez Guerrero is outstanding...so great to see her as such a young actress! Also fun to watch what an airport was light pre 9/11. All in all, a great movie to watch with a big bowl of popcorn and a soft drink....remembering the first time I saw it at the drive-in!",1387324800,,860,4.627450980392157
939017,5,630491010X,"A blizzard hits Lincoln International Airport, and Burt Lancaster the airport manager must take care of family matters, a Boeing 707 stuck on the runway, and a bomb-damaged airliner that needs to land as soon as possible. That is the basic plot of Airport, a very entertaining disaster-drama from 1970. It features a big cast of interesting characters, including Helen Hayes as an elderly stowaway who is hilarious (there is a lot of comic relief, which in this case isn't really a bad thing).

The new single-disc DVD with the silver cover is the one I'm reviewing. The picture looks great. The Bonus Features are my only complaint - there are three, and the only one that actually has to do with Airport is the theatrical trailer. The other two are short documentaries - one on Universal Studios' backlot and the other covering the various Universal films that came out during the 70's. Sure, these documentaries are interesting, and they do show a clip from Airport in a long montage, but I would expect a film nominated for 10 Academy Awards to have some more extras actually having to do with the film.

Still, this seems to be the best DVD you can get - I've heard bad things about the previous one released by Goodtimes Entertainement. The cover design is nice aswell.",1384560000,,1275,4.713004484304933

I used to fly between New York and Chicago for business back then, and I had plenty of my own experiences getting snow-bound in O'Hare airport in Chicago, and the technology in this movie seems very real to me. Of course, the storyline is a bit melodramatic or soap opera-ish, but hey, it's entertainment! Most of the action takes place in the snow-bound fictional Chicago airport called ""Lincoln"" in the film (but we all know its supposed to be O'Hare), and on a Chicago-to-Rome flight. The 1970's technologies shown in this movie are real and well researched, and definately adds to the enjoyment of the movie. There are some very good (sometimes over-the-top) performances by the then well-known actors such as Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, George Kennedy, Helen Hayes (who provides some comic relief), and others, but the star of this movie is the workhorse Boeing 707 jet airliner.

Others have reviewed the movie, and since I am not a videophile I can only give you my layman's impressions of the bluray.

More importantly, given that this was one of the last films shot in the Todd-AO format, the quality of the picture in its Blu-Ray edition leaves a lot to be desired.

939284,5,630491010X,"Airport remains a very good movie despite the passage of time; as another reviewer notes it's one of the first airplane disaster films and it deserves that title. The casting was very well done; there are so many big name stars in the film and they all give terrific, convincing performances. The rest of the cast does a great job of acting, too! There's lots of suspense but the film moves along at a very good pace; never feeling rushed or too slow--this even allows for some character development along the way. The special effects were well done although some are dated by today's computerized standards; and the cinematography and choreography both reflect forethought. The musical score generally enhances the film but there are times when it's essentially music that tells you how to feel.

When the action (and there's plenty of it) starts, we see a 707 jet airliner coming in for a landing during a snowstorm at a rather busy international airport. Unfortunately, the jet gets caught in the heavy snow on a runway and it is absolutely stuck, forcing airport top brass including general manager Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster) to use an alternate runway that is highly controversial because it creates huge noise problems for the residents living near the airport. There's also airline pilot and Bakersfeld's brother-in-law Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) who hates Mel for some unknown reason; Vernon has to fly to Rome that evening to evaluate another pilot--and escape his wife for three days in Rome with his lover, flight attendant (""stewardess"" as she's called in the movie) Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset).

Things get even more complicated when they discover stowaway Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes), a cunning elderly lady who simply hops planes whenever she wants to using a few tricks to get past airport officials; and Vernon doesn't know what to think or do when Gwen informs him just before the flight to Rome that she is pregnant by him! Of course anything can really happen when D. O. Guerrero (Van Heflin) boards the plane carrying a homemade bomb in an attach case. There's plenty more to the story--no spoilers here; watch the film and find out what happens!

Look also for Maureen Stapleton as Inez Guerrero; Jean Seberg as Tanya Livingston, Mel Bakersfield's assistant and airport public relations troubleshooter; George Kennedy as the very experienced airplane/airport wizard ""Patroni;"" Barry Nelson as Anson Harris; Dana Wynter as Mel Bakersfeld's wife Cindy; Lloyd Nolan as Harry Standish; Barbara Hale as Sarah; Gary Collins as Cy Jordan; John Findlater as airport employee Peter Coakley and James Nolan as Father Steven Lonigan.

Some say Airport is somewhat dated but I think it's still very good entertainment. True, it's a bit melodramatic with its soap opera relationships; but the overall plot remains believable especially when you consider it was made a while back before 9/11 style security measures were put into place. Fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections; people who like thrillers and suspenseful dramas with action will also enjoy this film.",1352332800,2,3124,5.060194174757282
939285,4,630491010X,"""Airport"" was basically the start of the 1970s disaster films.  There had been ""disaster"" movies before: ""San Francisco"" with Clark Gable, ""In Old Chicago"" with Tyrone Power, and ""The Hurricane"" with Jon Hall, to name just three from the 1930s, but they really took off in the Seventies (""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""Earthquake,"" etc.).  But what was at the heart of ""Airport"" was...heart.  It came from an Arthur Hailey novel, one of those thick kind filled with character plots.  Anyway, ""Airport"" brought together old and new stars in this story of an unhappy marriage, a love affair, a man so driven by desperation who brings a bomb on board to get insurance money for his wife, an old lady stowaway, and a heavy winter storm causing havoc on the runways of the airport.

This was a very enjoyable film in its day and still is today.  It was one of the major inspirations for ""Airplane!"" (""Zero Hour"" was another.)  The stars of this production were all perfect...except for one.  Dean Martin, famous in show business life for his image as a harddrinker, as the co-pilot?  (Mad Magazine had fun with that in their satire of the film, named ""Airplot"".)  Burt Lancaster is the general manager of the airport, trying to balance the needs of the many in the terminal and up in the air with those of his demanding wife at home.  Jacqueline Bisset is the stewardess whose affair with co-pilot Martin has resulted in her being pregnant.  George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton, Dana Wynter, and Jean Seberg round out the cast.  And, oh, yes, Helen Hayes as a charming old lady who has gotten quite good at slipping unchecked onto different flights in order to be able to see her family around the country.  Hayes was so delightful that she won the Best Supporting Actress for her performance.  (By the way, ""Airport"" was nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture.)

There was one other element to making this picture successful and that was Alfred Newman's musical score.  It comes in powerful at the beginning and plays under the dangerous landing, helping to project the tensions.  He is also equally romantic in several sections.  If you don't know of Alfred Newman, I highly recommend you watch movies with his scores.  Actually, you probably do know one piece of his music without knowing you do.  The 20th Century Fox fanfare at the beginning of a film is his.  Some of the titles on Blu-ray with his scores are ""How the West Was Won,"" ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and ""The Robe"" (one of his very best scores).

The picture quality is very good, probably as good as we will get from this.

Audio is excellent.  While dialogue is front and center, you may not notice it but you do get a subtle use of music and sound effects that adds to the whole experience.

Extras are on the extremely slim side.  A trailer and two retrospective featurettes (100 Years of Universal: The Lot and 100 Years of Universal: The '70s).

This package comes with a DVD and a digital copy.

939347,5,630491010X,"I can watch this movie at least once a year!  It's very entertaining and the score by Alfred Newman is his greatest work.  This is quite a statement considering Newman wrote so many great movie scores for 20th Century Fox, (although this is a Universal-Ross Hunter production).  Unlike many great artists, Newman saved his best for last, he passed in Feb 1970, and film was released in March.  The score was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, and it's hard to believe the Academy didn't give it a victory, especially considering Newman's death.

The opening theme sets the tone for a good suspenseful story.  It is a dramatic, rhythmic theme; the score also gives us a romantic love theme, and a very appropriate, catchy tune played for the Helen Hayes scenes.  (She won the best supporting actress oscar for her role--well deserved).  Van Heflin and Maureen Stapleton, along with Hayes, are at the top of their game. Lancaster, Martin, and George Kennedy also give fine performances.

I can remember seeing this as a tweleve year old kid in Radio City Music Hall in NY in 1970--it was shown with the Easter Show--(it made such an impression on me, I still have the original program given out by Radio City). I do remember being on the edge of my seat, and it was well received by the full house with enthusiastic applause.  I still vividly remember the experience of seeing it on the big screen from the 2nd balcony.  The film had the whole audience glued to their seats.  I distinctly remember loud applause when Petroni (Kennedy) guns the 727 blocking a runway, and I remember uproarious laughter when Martin delivers his famous double-talk answer to a nerdy passenger. The line is still funny today.  Entertainment at its finest!",1324080000,3,1739,4.775919732441472

The stranded plane stuck in the mud is almost a secondary consideration, but the input from George Kennedy gives it LIFE!
Lancaster. Martin & Heflin are superb, with Maureen Stapleton showing her class with a standout performance albeit not many minutes on screen. A real tension builder with great soundtrack.",1313020800,,648,4.743362831858407

As I watched it again this evening(7/18/2011), I felt that I was in that balcony seat, enjoying it all over again.

939376,4,630491010X,"Airport (1970) may not have been the first disaster film, but it was the first one that was a huge commercial success, and launched the genre that would become extremely popular in the 70's.  The drama concerns the activities one night at Lincoln International Airport in Chicago during a raging snowstorm.  While following the routine matters related to commercial flight, the movie also features the personal stories of various characters, and the captivating Oscar winning performance of Helen Hayes as stowaway Ada Quonsett.  After the stage has be set, a suicidal bomber is introduced, turning what had been largely a battle against the elements, into a taught tale of suspense.  The all-star cast also includes Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bisset, Maureen Stapleton, Barry Nelson, and Dana Wynter.

One reason the film resonated with viewers, is because flying is a universal experience, and also because the phenomenon of terrorism and skyjacking was a frightening reality at the time.  Based on Arthur Hailey's novel, the screenplay was co-written by Hailey and George Seaton, who also directed the film.  Most of the drama concerning the characters is kind of sappy, but not that of D. O. Gurrero (Heflin), who plans to kill himself, so that his wife Inez (Stapleton) can claim his insurance money.  Scraping together the last of his cash to pay for flight insurance, Gurrero boards a plane bound for Rome, with the intention of setting off a briefcase bomb somewhere over the Atlantic.

Seated next to Gurrero is the incorrigible Ada Quonsett, who has sneaked aboard hoping to get to New York to visit her daughter.  The Trans Global fight turns around after receiving word about a possible bomb on board.  Then with the cooperation of Ms. Quonsett, Captain Demerest (Martin) and stewardess Gwen Meighen (Bisset) attempt to get Gurrero's briefcase.  Gwen manages to grab the case, but another passenger gets in the way, allowing Gurrero to get it back.  Then just when Demerest has almost convinced Gurrero to give up, the same jerk passenger shouts ""Grab him...He's got a bomb"", sending the panicked Gurrero into the lavatory where he sets off his bomb.

The special effects are simple but effective, as the setting inside the cabin is very tight and intimate, and aside from being extremely well lighted, seems pretty realistic.  Because of the weather, the plane has to land back in Chicago, where TWA's chief mechanic Joe Patroni (Kennedy) and airport manager Mel Bakersfield (Lancaster), manage to clear a key runway.  The film's rather sedate ending, would be something that would become atypical in the years to follow, as more destructive tension filled landings would become an all too common movie clich.

With its wide focus, Airport still manages to tell a story pretty well, giving depth to some key characters.  Helen Hayes really does carry the first part of the film with a delightful performance, and she has a key role aboard the plane.  Maureen Stapleton was also nominated for an Academy Award.  Jean Seberg, Van Heflin, and Dean Martin, are also very good.

Along with The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1974), and The Towering Inferno (1974), Airport is a must see for anyone interested in the genesis of disaster film genre.  The 30th Anniversary Remastered edition is the one to get, as the video quality of the regular edition from 1999, is VHS quality.

939378,5,630491010X,"If the disaster film genre of the 1970s had an actual starting point, it would arguably have to be with the 1970 film AIRPORT.  Based on Arthur Hailey's best-selling 1968 novel of the same name, and adapted to the screen by director George Seaton, who also did the 1947 Christmas classic MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, it not only spawned three sequels of its own, but it also led to the massive box office successes (and critical ulcers) of films like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, EARTHQUAKE, and THE TOWERING INFERNO.

The setting for AIRPORT is Lincoln International Airport in Chicago on a snowbound winter night.  Burt Lancaster portrays the airport's general manager who, on this night, is beset by any number of minor crises: a brother-in-law (Dean Martin) who needles him about the way he runs the place; a jet stuck in the snow out on the tarmac because its pilot cut the taxiway short; an elderly stowaway (Helen Hayes) causing havoc for security; and problems at home with a wife (Dana Wynter) who gets into an argument over his being far more obsessed with his job than with his home life.  He somehow manages to keep it together, however, thanks to the help of a very reliable staff, including tough-as-nail mechanic Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), who helps to get that stuck 747 out of the snow so that a vital runway isn't clogged for too long (with that runway being closed, jets are forced to take off on a runway right in the path of homes whose owners have fiercely complained about the noise).

This night, however, he is facing another, far more serious crisis.  A mentally unstable and very depressed man (Van Heflin) has managed to get on a flight from Chicago to Rome being piloted by Martin and Nelson; and in his suitcase, the only one he brings onboard (and keeps very close to him), is a bomb.  Alerted to this as the flight is passing through the airspace monitored from Cleveland, they try to turn the plane around and head back to Chicago while at the same time trying to find a way to disarm Heflin without frightening any of the passengers.  That, however, doesn't go quite as planned; and the end result is a harrowing drive towards a highly dramatic climax.

AIRPORT was clearly never meant to be anything other than old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment (and it was indeed old-fashioned by Hollywood standards of 1970), thanks in no small part to Hayes' dotty performance as the elderly stowaway (which won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar); and it indeed works that way, like it or not.  The performances by Lancaster, Martin, Kennedy, and Hayes are all what you'd expect from professionals like them; and the cast includes Jacqueline Bisset (as Martin's love interest), Larry Gates, Maureen Stapleton, Jean Seberg, Lloyd Nolan, Barbara Hale, and Whit Bissell.  Newman's score (his last; he passed away only a few weeks before the film's release) is also quite good and appropriate, and got nominated for both an Oscar and Grammy, posthumously.

While a lot of the clich&eacute;s introduced in this film and its three subsequent sequels would nauseate critics and eventually lead to all of them being sent up in the 1980 comedy blockbuster AIRPLANE!, AIRPORT nevertheless moves at a fairly good clip, given that it's close to 140 minutes in length and its special effects work is painfully dated in the 21st century age of CGI.  It also helps that some of the concerns raised in this movie, which came true in light of 9/11, have somehow managed to keep this film relatively relevant, which is saying something, given how many Hollywood films come and go every year.",1267747200,,3593,4.80388978930308
939379,4,630491010X,"I think the knock on Disaster Films, besides the fact they are action-oriented plots with minimal character development, is that most of them were churned out during the early 1970s, a Golden Era of Hollywood history (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Riders-Raging-Bulls-How-the-Sex-Drugs-and-Rock-N-Roll-Generation-Saved-Hollywood/dp/0684857081/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood</a>).

The year 1970 was a time of incredible social upheaval, and fans could buy a movie ticket and remember a more innocent era (the film was rated G). ""Airport"" is an artistic tribute to bygone decades, with recognizable faces such as Van Heflin, Helen Hayes, Lloyd Nolan, Dana Wynter and, to a lessor extent, Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, going through the machinations of the plot (based on the Arthur Hailey bestseller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport/dp/1568495625/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport</a>, perfect for a pool-side read), relying on their historical reps to fill in the gaps. It's an enormous tribute to an antique age.

The special effects, tame by today's standards, are still quite good. And the concluding moments, with Heflin hugging a suitcase bomb and co-pilot Gary Collins staring at a growing crack at the rear of the airplane, are terrifying. But the tension-filled screams and terror of the closing dramatics are not really what remains in memory after viewing ""Airport."" What you remember is George Kennedy as Joe Patroni.

Kennedy, an underrated actor at the peak of popularity in 1970 following his Oscar win for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-Hand-Luke-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0019UGYK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a>,"" steals the show. His performance as Patroni, a cigar-chomping bad-ass who probably totes a lunch pail to work everyday, is electric. He would star as Joe throughout the ""Airport"" series, the lone connecting thread during the sequels. I have always loved the famous scene where he angrily guns the airliner through the snow to clear the runway, a moment likely producing audience applause during it's initial run. And the final scene, when Kennedy lumbers past the suits and slaps the side of the airplane with a clipboard, mumbling proud praise to the damaged craft, ends ""Airport"" on a perfect note.

I've seen actors attempt the tough-guy-blue-collar persona before, usually failing miserably. None did it better than Kennedy in the 1970s. Look no further than his terrific performance when trying to decipher why ""Airport"" made such an incredible fortune. He's a working class stud, with little time for meetings, brass or pleasantries. His character, comforting to 1970's audiences, harkens back to the era of WW II when working class men symbolically rolled up their sleeves to get the job done in Europe, a very different war from what was going on in Vietnam at the time.

Kennedy's Patroni symbolized a venerable American ideal which exists to this day. During the great frustrations of the Nixon/Vietnam age (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nixon-Agonistes-The-Crisis-of-the-Self-Made-Man/dp/0618134328/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man</a>), it was inspiring. At times of personal and professional crisis, we would all like to face our fears in Patroni fashion, spitting into its eye and throwing the rule book into the nearest wastebasket. One could argue that independents like Patroni, crucial to any working team, have slowly and inexorably been eroded into extinction by the growing culture of corporate America, symbolized (even at this time) by the educated suits standing zombie-like in the hangar as Patroni strolls past them to get back to work. Today, ""Airport"" indeed reminds audiences of a bygone era, but not for the reasons you would think. In a hysterical world, Kennedy's Patroni is a touchstone.",1255132800,,5569,6.739916550764951

939381,5,630491010X,"Had to be pulled by the ear and dragged into Radio City Music Hall in NYC by my mother to see this one in 1970. And I am so thankful that she did as AIRPORT proved to be a thoroughly engaging and entertaining production with an all-star cast. Among the stars were five Oscar winners---Burt Lancaster [ELMER GANTRY, 1960], Van Heflin [JOHNNY EAGER, 1942], Helen Hayes [THE SIN OF MADELON CLAUDET, 1931], George Kennedy [COOL HAND LUKE, 1967] and Maureen Stapleton [REDS, 1981]. The plot centers around a despondent, mentally unstable Joe who can't keep a job and provide for his family and decides to board a plane with a bomb to do the unthinkable so that his beloved but unwitting wife can collect the insurance money. In the meantime Burt Lancaster is the General Manager of the snowbound ""AIRPORT"" whose only safe and useable runway is blocked by a Jet stuck in the snow. He is being bombarded from all sides---by his neglected wife who doesn't get to see her interminably busy husband enough, by local politicians who want his airport closed due to complaints of noise pollution and even by colleague pilots and co-workers who question his decisions and probably sit in wait for him to make the gaffe that will send him to the gallows. The beautiful Jean Seberg plays his co-worker girlfriend who is always by his side. The passengers on the plane are fun characterizations and include the annoyingly intrusive loudmouth who stirs the pot, the perturbingly know-it-all teen, the 'Doc', the Priest, the nuns---many spoofed in the wonderfully delicious comedy classic, AIRPLANE [1980]. Dean Martin at first appeared miscast as the doomed jet's Captain but, being the fine actor that he is, was able to pull it off. He is also Lancaster's brother-in-law in the movie but is having a relationship with one of his stewardesses played by the ethereal British actress Jacqueline Bisset. There is some frank talk about abortion, its consequences and alternatives after she discovers that she is carrying his child. The terse and melancholic Heflin is terrific as the bomber aka ""Guerrero, D.O."". His disappointed but always supportive spouse is played by Maureen Stapleton who should have won the best female supporting actress Oscar over Hayes for her short but wonderfully sensitive and poignant portrayal. Their talk in the Diner before his departure was evocative. Hayes was cute and endearing as the septuagenarian flimflam artist and stowaway. George Kennedy is a gas as Joe Patroni the ultra-experienced blue-collar 707 expert who is called upon to get the stuck-in-the-snow Jet out of the way so that the last runway, and the Airport, can remain open. This becomes an exigency when, after the bomber succeeds, that runway is the only hope for the disabled jet. Kennedy's riotous exchange with the pilots not willing to press the pedal to the metal and thrust the stuck jet out of the snow in fear that they will damage the structure is memorable and his last-chance personal 'let-it-all-hang-out' try is a blast. Hey, Joe Patroni is always welcomed in my house. Too bad that recollections of this excellent film have been blurred by the subsequent awful Airport sequeals and a slew of superficial disaster flicks over the years. This, the original AIRPORT, had it all: drama, romance, comedy, suspense...etc...truly great entertainment. Thanks to THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY [1954] for the inspiration.

939442,3,630491010X,"I have tended to remember the disaster movies of the 1970's as a vein of the action movie genre, the latter being a series of explosions and special effects linked with episodes of sex and violence, and four word sentences.  Given my first hand experience with the seventies, I really wouldn't have thought I'd recommend any disaster movie to my worst enemy.  Then, a friend insisted we watch Airport.  I was so wrong.  This is not an action flick, as described.  Airport has vestiges of classic Hollywood, in its production values, and it's writing and direction. This is actually a movie!  It has a plot, which takes its time to develop (a bit unsettling for anyone who thought they'd pop it in and sort-of pay attention) and there are subplots.  There are a lot of characters, some of them young enough to make one realize that they were just starting out.  And then of course, there's Dean Martin as a pilot.  By the end of the movie you're no longer laughing at that idea.

The story begins with a plane stuck in the snow on a Nebraska runway (Minneapolis airport, actually) and another plane taking off for Rome (from Nebraska, in the seventies?).  There's a couple of failing marriages, politicians nervous over plane noise in the suburbs, Helen Hayes as a habitual stowaway, who, of course, stows away on THIS flight, and Dean Martin in love with a stewardess, played by Jacqueline Bisset, who of course is pregnant, and oh yes, there's a guy with a bomb in his brief case; and of course the bomb goes off, and the ONLY place the plane can land, is back in Nebraska.  Oh yeah, remember that stuck plane?

We thought the Soviet Union looked gloomy, in the seventies.  This film makes America look pretty gloomy.  Design seems an afterthought, although Edith Head did all the clothes, so everyone at least looks better than the rooms and terminals.  And boy does everyone seem so...adult, so grown up.  Such a short time ago, and yet a world away.

This is not a background film.  You'll have to dedicate the time, and its about two hours, to watch it.  But it's a good film, entertaining, with likeable and mostly believable characters.

With its strong cast, the film provides excitement, thrill and tension played on the wide-spread danger of air travel...

Directed by the veteran George Seaton, ""Airport"" has two romantic triangles besides some major complications...

Burt Lancaster performs the unhappily-married man to an elegant Dana Wynter, and the exhausted airport manager who, in a single night, is forced to contend with everything, from a devastating snow-storm to a Boeing 707 bomber...

Helen Hayes stands out as the eccentric little old lady passenger, winner of a well-deserved Oscar as Supporting Actress, after a 12-year absence from the screen...

Another nominee is Maureen Stapleton in an outstanding performance as the afflictive, desperate wife of an expert in demolition (a disturb Heflin) projecting vitality and fatigue as vulnerability and strength to her role...

Barbara Hale does not have much showcasing compared to the scene-stealing performances of Hayes or Stapleton but she handles well the sequence of relief, then despair and finally resignation as she witnesses her husband escorting Bisset in the climax of the film...

George Kennedy is excellent as the 'biting cigar' maintenance Chief Patroni, the expert in the aviation world... The scene of his maneuvering of the Boeing, trapped in the snow, to free the runway, is incredible... In this scene we can appreciate the prototype of the Boeing 707 that 'could do everything, but read.'

The highlights of the film: the scene of the cabin class, after the violent explosion; the effects of the compression at 30,000 feet; the Radar Room and Air Traffic Control; and the unperturbed voice of one of the Air Controller, his steadiness, serenity, skill and knowledge...

I did see butchered versions of this movie on TV and from that, gathered that this was a airplane disaster movie.  That was half correct.  I rented the video for this just to see some 1970's nostalgia and yes it was fun.  Fun?  An airline disaster movie, fun.  Well, by today's standards, it is hard to find this as edge-of-your-seat material in which it probally  was back in it's day.

I named my review ""As the airplane flys...... "" as a knock-off title for ""As The World Turns"" which is something I do alot when it comes to overblown drama taking place in different settings - usually places of employment.  For example for drama taking place in a coffee shop ""As The Coffee Brews"", concerning the ""Going Postal"" incidents in the Postal Service ""As The Mail Goes Through""  Ok enough of that but the point of all this is an attempt to describe the type of movie this comes off as.  It comes off like an expanded big screen General Hospital soap opera, but with an airport instead.  This is not at all meant as a complaint.

Here is what is going on:  There is this airport in dire need of updating and modification.  First, one of the runways is the cause for complaints from nearby residents taking issue with noise pollution and (exaggerated) quaking at night.  So they have had it are are picketing to get the runway closed.  Furthermore they are threatening to sue.  Second, you have a blizzard shaping up which has dumped a considerable amount of snow on the runways...enough to cause a jetliner to get stuck while taxiing into the terminal.

Now for the people involved.  You have the airport manager whose marriage is about to crash and burn over his not being home.  You have a pilot and a stewardess having an affair and she is carrying his baby!  You have an adorable old lady with a not-so-adorable habit of stealing her way onto flights and then you have a distraught man who cannot seem to hold onto a job resorting to boarding a plane with a bomb in order to blow it up so his wife can collect on the insurance policy he just purchased.

All of the ingredients for a disaster both in the air and on the ground are ready, so now we mix.  So you have an airplane in the air with a bomber on board, and it needs to turn around and come back, but lets not forget about the jetliner stuck in the snow.  Unless the crew can move it out of the way, the now-in-distress airliner must use the alternate runway with is the one the residents are uproaring about and also, in the blizzard poses a landing hazzard.  The higher ups want to shut down the airport as all other airports have shut due to the blizzard, but now an airliner in distress must land there.... and still they have not gotten that other airplane unstuck.

You would think this could make for some heavy suspense but what seems to come out is a drama-comedy that is hard to take as seriously as intended and with the cute old lady and a overly dramatic passenger on the flight, it seems to keep the movie on the light side.

One thing you will find here is that dialog and acting is king, not the use of special effects which are in pretty sorry shape by today's standards.  You are taken into each situation as it unfolds be it the old lady getting grilled about her illegal habit or the wife of the bomber trying despartly to prevent a disaster...but is too late.  It seems that the disaster itself takes a backseat to the characters.

While the drama in the air is dire, it somehow doesn't steal the show which centers around the airport's woes and how the people are dealing with them in the face of this blizzard and getting this plane back safely, hence is probally why this movie is titled ""Airport"" and not ""Airplane"".  Speaking of ""Airplane"", it is easy to see where the latter movie got's material from for it's over-the-top spoof.",1147478400,2,4048,4.370320855614973

939449,5,630491010X,"The original ""Airport"" (released in theaters in 1970 and nominated for many Academy Awards, including ""Best Picture"") is a good movie that never fails to entertain (IMHO), regardless of the number of previous screenings.

A hectic winter night at a major midwest U.S. airport makes for a fun and varied movie script (which is a script based on Arthur Hailey's popular novel), complete with a bomb-toting Rome-bound passenger, a 70-year-old female stowaway, multiple extramarital affairs, a whopper of a snowstorm, and a Boeing 707 that's stuck in the snow, blocking the airport's primary runway.

And as if that weren't enough to keep airport General Manager ""Mel Bakersfeld"" (Burt Lancaster) busy, he's also got to contend with an angry group of citizens from a nearby town who want the airport shut down due to aircraft flying too low over their homes late at night.

But Mel is up to the task of handling all of these frenetic assignments in ""Airport"", a film that's not very big on special effects, and some of the situations are more contrived than genuinely tense .... but, nevertheless, this film has got a certain ""something"", a quality that's difficult for me to put my finger on. It's just got something I like very much. (Maybe it's the fetching 25-year-old Jacqueline Bisset. Well, she's part of the ""something"", I must readily admit. ~wink~)

""Airport"", as most fans of the film know by now, ushered in a whole new genre of motion pictures -- the ""All-Star Disaster Movie"". Three sequels followed ""Airport"", but none of them could equal the impressive scope and grandeur of the original. None of the three follow-ups had that extra special ""something"" (in my opinion, that is). I enjoy watching the sequels, however, with the exception of the dismal ""Airport '79"", which is good only for a few unintentional belly-laughs. But ""Airport 1975"" and ""Airport '77"" have their own individual charms too, making them at least worth a look (or two).

--------------------

Some ""Disaster Film"" History:

There were a few films before ""Airport"" that could be placed in the ""disaster"" genre too .... such as 1954's ""The High And The Mighty"" and the Doris Day vehicle ""Julie"" from 1956 (which is one of my favorite Doris pictures, in which she must take control of a commercial airliner in mid-flight and bring her in for a landing). Actually, to be technical though, ""Julie"" is really more of a suspense drama/thriller, with the airplane ""disaster"" angle not entering the script until late in the film.

There were also, of course, the pre-1970s movies revolving around the true story of the 1912 sinking of the infamous ocean liner ""Titanic"" -- including ""A Night To Remember"" (1958) and, before that even, ""Titanic"", from 1953.

Another very good ""gloom and doom"" movie that was made before ""Airport's"" time is ""The Last Voyage"", released in 1960, starring Robert Stack and Edmond O'Brien. Stack, of course, would go on to co-star in the hilarious ""Airplane!"" in 1980, which serves as the ultimate fun-poking ""spoof flick"" of all-time.

Bob Stack also co-starred in the 1975 made-for-TV peril-in-the-sky melodrama ""Murder On Flight 502"". Remember that one? It had Farrah Fawcett as the head stewardess and Polly Bergen as a drunken mystery writer. It also had more conveniently-arranged contrivances and coincidences than practically any other movie of its kind you're likely to run into. But, nevertheless, it's still fun to re-visit occasionally for its lengthy cast roster of Hollywood stars.

Another pre-'70s drama that loosely fits in with the ""Airport"" genre is 1964's ""Fate Is The Hunter"", starring Glenn Ford and Suzanne Pleshette.

Other ""disaster""-laden films from the earlier days of cinema include ""San Francisco"" (1936), which re-creates the 1906 earthquake in that California city .... ""The War Of The Worlds"" (1953) .... ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" (1961) .... and ""Fail-Safe"" (1964).

Two additional lower-budget '60s films come to mind as well, both made in 1962 -- ""Panic In Year Zero"" and ""This Is Not A Test"". The latter of those two flicks is a super-low-budget camp-fest, with acting so bad in places it feels more like a comedy, rather than a serious ""doomsday"" movie about a nuclear-bomb threat. But even that film, as bad as it is, has a certain re-watchable quality to it, via its dark and brooding all-nighttime photography.

But when ""Airport"" reached theater screens in early March of 1970, the ""Disaster Movie Cycle"" began in earnest...and would continue throughout the entire decade of the '70s. Producer Ross Hunter's slick and polished ""Airport"" drama, with its intertwining plot devices and the ever-present feeling that sudden death might lurk nearby, seemed to open the floodgates for so many peril-filled motion pictures that followed.

In addition to the four-movie ""Airport"" franchise, other 1970s films of this exciting genre that kept movie-goers coming back for more included: ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), ""Skyjacked"" (1972), ""Earthquake"" (1974), ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""The Cassandra Crossing"" (1976), ""Two-Minute Warning"" (1976), ""Black Sunday"" (1977), ""Gray Lady Down"" (1978), ""The Swarm"" (1978), ""Meteor"" (1979), ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), and the ""Poseidon"" sequel ""Beyond The Poseidon Adventure"" (1979).

The 1990s saw a re-awakening of the disaster flick, with several ""The-World's-Coming-To-An-End"" type of films being produced, such as: ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Armageddon"" (1998), and ""Deep Impact"" (1998).

The '90s also saw the release of ""Twister"" (1996), ""Executive Decision"" (1996), ""Dante's Peak"" (1997), ""Volcano"" (1997), and, of course, the movie which has made more money at the box office than any other film in history, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" (1997).

But if you're a fan of the ""disaster"" movie genre, the decade to crawl back into the most would no doubt be the 1970s, with the always-fun-to-watch ""Airport"" setting the pace.

--------------------

This review is attached to a rare and out-of-print VHS videotape edition of ""Airport"" (distributed by MCA-Universal Home Video in 1991). This VHS version features a Full-Frame (1.33:1), Pan-and-Scan print of the movie; and that, of course, ain't good (at all). The movie should be seen as it was shown in theaters in 1970, and that would in 2.35:1 Widescreen. (This VHS copy, though, has some attractive artwork on the front of the package, I must say.)

No Full-Frame version can do justice to the intended Widesceen image of this, or any other, movie that was originally photographed in the very wide 2.35:1 video ratio. Very good Widescreen copies of ""Airport"" have been released on DVD since this miserable P&S version was issued in the pre-DVD days. The 2001 GoodTimes Home Video WS edition DVD is quite nice; and the 2004 Universal Home Video Digital Disc version is even a tad better yet. The Universal edition is part of the 2-Disc ""Airport Terminal Pack"", which gathers all four films from the ""Airport"" franchise in one nice, compact DVD boxed set.

So, I'd suggest that all true fans of fun 1970s-era cinema grab ahold of at least one of the above-referenced editions of Ross Hunter's and George Seaton's pioneering ""Airport"" before Joe Patroni comes after you with a wrench. (And we all know how Joe is when he gets a little ticked-off....it could get nasty. ~wink~)

--------------------

Allow me to close with an array of some of my favorite ""tirades"" that take place throughout the 137-minute ""Airport"" motion picture (there are lots of good, and humorous, fits of anger to choose from in this flick):

""You keep leanin' on that shovel, Jack, you're gonna freeze solid, like Lot's wife! We wanna move this airplane before it becomes obsolete! The way you guys keep heading for this bus, it looks like you've got a broad stashed in there! Out!! Everybody out!!"" -- Spoken with verve by the no-nonsense Joe Patroni

------

""You think they could have decided that before we left the terminal! Making us sit hear and worry; it's inexcusable! Go away {little boy}, your nose is running!"" -- Marcus Rathbone, an extremely likeable and friendly (not!) passenger aboard ""Trans Global"" Flight #2 to Rome

------

""Crafty little old biddy!"" -- Tanya Livingston

------

""This plane is built to withstand anything -- except a BAD PILOT!!"" -- Joe Patroni

------

""But I specifically asked for the FOURTH ROW! .... Oh, give it to me! Give it to me!"" -- Another gem from the kindly lips of M. Rathbone

------

""What are we going to do about these Jumbos, that seat five hundred passengers? .... It's time for you and all the other commissioners to start fighting for a bond issue to finance THIS kind of {expanded} airport! Instead of running around checking to see if the toilets flush!"" -- Mel Bakersfeld

------

""Miss! Miss! These nuts are stale! .... Four hundred and seventy-four dollars and they give you stale nuts!"" -- Mr. Rathbone again (he was a real prize; every flight attendant's worst nightmare come to life) :-)

------

""Well, if it's {runway} two-two, I'm not using noise abatement, and not cutting back on power over those houses! So unless you want a big fat bill for cracked plaster and a lot of broken dishes, you better move this thing!!"" -- ""Trans Global Airlines"" Captain Vernon Demerest

------

""Where were you when the pilots and the rest of us were pleading for more airports and better traffic control?! YOU were picking out the colors in the ladies' lounge!"" -- Mel Bakersfeld

------

""It's highway robbery! Why the airlines don't provide free transportation, I'll never know!"" -- Rathbone again (who else?) :-)",1139702400,5,9616,5.086458995549904

939491,5,630491010X,"Being the only child on the plane, I can speak from first hand experience. This movie was the start of the entire disaster craze. I have many fond memories of kicking it with Jacqueline Bisset between takes and watching the dailies of the bomb explosion scene. Dean Martin was pretty much enamored with himself through the entire shoot. The doting women on the set didn't help matters. I had my own trailer right next to David Cassidy (Partridge Family Fame/Teen Idol). Also Planet of the Apes was shooting at the same time as Airport. I watched Universal Studios evolve into it's first tours. The evolution of a theme park was taking place right before my eyes. What glorious times these were. Truly fond memories working with some of the greatest actors of their time. Burt Lancaster, Helen Hayes, George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton and of course Jacqueline Bisset. Forget about it.

No other movie has spawned so many sequels and spoofs as this one did. 10 Academy nominations including best picture can't be wrong. Times have not changed that much. Good is good.

I suspect that one day, I will be the only surviving cast member since I was only five years old when we did this shoot. I highly recommend this movie, but then again.... I might be biased.",1124064000,7,1268,4.733031674208145

There were others following that one; I can vaguely remember Doris Day as a stewardess without any flight training being talked down.  I think there was enough of a gap between H&M and Airport stewn with redundant remakes of each other, that when Airport released in '70, having more action, that people forgot the others.  Now, so many years later, it just seems like the first.  I have my copy of H&M, not seen in 25 years (likely why anyone under 40 has no knowledge of it) and plan to purchase Airport.  I went to the theatre for all the subsequent air disasters and was primed for the two Airplane spoofs.  It was a genre most in need of spoofing, especially after Karen Black's participation.

So Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin (a playboy type who learns one of the stewardesses is carrying his baby) limp back to the now-closed and snowbound airport hoping to land in one piece. They do, of course, but only after a Herculean effort by the ground crew to clear the runway. Lots of subplots involving characters (kind of like a GRAND HOTEL in the sky), and very slick - but very entertaining and watchable. Helen Hayes won a supporting actress Oscar.

939494,5,630491010X,"This first of the big airplane disaster movies features an outstanding cast, a host of distinctive characters, and a widely interesting web of subplots.  While all things lead to disaster in the air, there is a much greater human component to Airport than what you will see in the disaster movies of today.  Perhaps the human drama does not play out to perfection on one or two occasions, yet it all kept my rapt fascination even as I wondered why disaster had not yet struck an hour and a half into the film (which lasts for two hours and seventeen minutes).  Airport (1970) picked up ten Academy Award nominations, including best picture, Helen Hayes walked away from it with her second Oscar, and a host of sequels followed in its wake, so obviously it did many things right.

The first half of the film actually seems like some kind of 1970s TV pilot.  Mel Bakersfield (Burt Lancaster) is the airport manager working himself to death in order to keep the place running smoothly, campaigning when he can for expansion and modernization.  His brother-in-law pilot Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) assumes the role of Bakersfield's antagonist, criticizing airport measures for keeping the runways operational and the flights on schedule, especially on nights such as the one in question, when a major snowstorm is wreaking havoc on the ground as well as in the air.  Bakersfield is locked in an unhappy marriage with a regal yet noxious social gadfly, facing the fact that the woman he now cares about may be leaving her job at the airport for a better opportunity elsewhere.  Demerest has some kind of marriage of convenience to Bakerfield's sister, and he is carrying on with a lovely and suddenly pregnant stewardess (they still called them stewardesses back in 1970) played by the engaging Jacqueline Bisset.  Then you have the heavy of the group, Joe Patroni (George ""If it's an airplane movie, I'm in it"" Kennedy), the only man for the job of getting an airplane stuck in the snow out of the way of the main landing strip.  Helen Hayes plays a delightfully entertaining serial stowaway, and while she is naturally fantastic in her role, the size and importance of her part would not seem to merit the Best Actress award she received for her performance.  About the time you start looking for Aaron Spelling's name to come up in the closing credits, we are finally introduced to a nervous fellow putting together an attache case of explosives.  He is presented in the most sentimental of lights, and one can't help but feel sorry for him and for the rash decision he has made, nor can one do anything but curse the otherwise forgettable character who plays the dumbest airplane passenger in history.

Eventually, the plane takes off for Rome with both the stowaway and the bomber on board; soon thereafter, puzzle pieces begin to fall into place, and the pilots, aware of the danger, try to turn around and head for home.  Their safe return faces two major obstacles: the bomber on board and the stuck airplane jutting out on the only landing strip they can safely attempt to land on through the roaring blizzard.  Don't expect a lot of special effects or outrageous acts of unrealistic heroics (although there is a priest who delivers a most unorthodox and intensely satisfying blessing to the aforementioned dumbest airplane passenger on earth).  What happens is presented very well, but the real drama lies in the characters' relationships.  I am a huge Dean Martin fan, and I thought the man delivered a terrific dramatic performance in this movie, standing equally beside the likes of the legendary Lancaster, Bisset, and Hayes.  The story may seem to develop slowly for those used to or expecting quick and impressive action and special effects, but this movie follows the old creed that there can be no real tragedy unless the audience knows and cares about the characters.",1059696000,33,3883,4.83987915407855
939495,4,630491010X,"In 1969, who could have imagined what frightful places airports could become? But for its time, Arthur Hailey's best-seller portrayed one metropolitan airport as a quite frenzied place, especially during a severe snowstorm. And, this novel may have been the only one to spawn one movie, three sequels, and two parodies.
With an all-star ensemble pitting arrogant pilot (Dean Martin) against the mild-manner Operations Director (Burt Lancaster), the film reveals one full night in which many characters' subplots intertwine while revealing the airport's infrastructure and many tricks of the trade.
But the major story is that of financially troubled ""D.O. Guerrero"" (Van Heflin) who ambles onboard a Rome-bound flight with a simple briefcase bomb poised for his wife to collect insurance. Despite a carefully planned ploy by an elderly stowaway (Helen Hayes), the bomb explodes leaving the 727 seriously crippled and needing to return home. With masterful piloting by Martin, the plane descends, desperately needing the longest runway which is still blocked by a plane that skidded earlier that evening.
With 179 souls on board, only Lancaster can give the order for an assembly of tractors to literally shred the obstacle off the needed runway. But the top mechanic (George Kennedy) insists he can rock the stuck plane out of the way.",1053129600,5,1335,5.30188679245283

Burt, himself, is the man's man. He tries to keep it together on the ground, following an in-flight explosion by a crazy called Guerrero.

939497,3,630491010X,"Airport signalled the beginning of the 'disaster' movie phenomenon of the 1970's. The disaster movie was the perfect vehicle to showcase the increased quality and depth of special effects available to movie makers as well as the stereo sound in theatres.
The main problem with Airport is the pacing of the movie. For the first 1.5 hours, the pacing is excruciatingly slow. In this extremely slow build up, we are treated to soap opera theatrics including the mandatory 'husband leaving his wife for the young bimbo' storyline. There seems to be too many side stories that detract from the main focus of the 'mad bomber'. By the end of the 70's though, the problems inherent within Airport were worked on to give us gripping 'on the edge of your seat' disaster movies such as The Towering Inferno and Earthquake.
Not that Airport is a bad movie - just slow and packed with too many side stories. The exciting part of the movie lasts all of  an hour. But it is almost worth it to see the final scenes of the plane landing. It's also interesting to see the early 70's in full action - the orange chairs and gaudy yellow walls are captured for us all to appreciate and admire!

These days flying is little more than a glorified, albeit faster, ride on the bus. ""Airport"" features screen stars of its day and yesteryear.

The titles may simply vanish off the shelves and possibly never see the light of day again. Or, Universal may issue a marginally better edition itself at several times the price. Witness their re-issue of ""Halloween 2"", instead of a special edition we got another ""bare-bones"" DVD (the blood aside) very similiar to the Goodtimes release except for the price.

939551,4,630491010X,"As the first of the popular Airport movies, this film laid the groundwork and patterns for what would come - take a bunch of actors, some new and some veteran, give them each little melodramatic subplots, and link them together via aviation disaster.  This one concerns the problems that beset a Chicago airport when a huge snowstorm strikes the same night a looney tunes passenger decides to blow a hole with dynamite in a plane en route to Rome.  Dean Martin and Barry Nelson are the pilots on board trying to get the plane safely back to Chicago, while Burt Lancaster, Jean Seberg, and of course, George Kennedy work on the ground to solve the problems.  There's too much emphasis put on melodrama and failing marriages, but the last half of the film works well when the suspense kicks in.  The leads are all okay, but it's a few of the supporting performances that work best.  Maureen Stapleton is very believable and touching as the bomber's wife who is too late to prevent the tragedy, while Van Heflin as the bomber is appropriately intense.  Helen Hayes provides some of the film's best moments as a crafty stowaway, although the single best moment is provided by a priest towards the end who has a perfect way to shut up a panicked passenger.  Airport is very much a film of its time, but it is fun to watch, particularly once you've made it through the soap opera of the first half.  When the plane gets off the ground, so does the story.",1038614400,,1448,4.542307692307692
939552,5,630491010X,"""AIRPORT"" is one of those old-fashioned Sunday evening type movies that has been enjoyed by many.  Forget the abysmal sequels which turn alot of people off this original and enjoy the numerous plot twists that develop throughout.  The best acting comes from the supporting cast in which Helen Hayes and in particular Van Heflin standout.  Though overlong (A minor gripe) the direction is taut and the suspense level is maintained.  If viewing this movie at home,go for the DVD version (Widescreen preferably) I rate this DVD highly",1031270400,4,531,5.068965517241379

She is the only good thing about this film. Her performance as the mad bombers wife is so vividly brought to the screen that it breaks your heart. I'm not going to go into detail about this film because it's long and predictable and boring at times. Many people feel that Helen Hayes is a good part of this film, but please how many quirky old ladies can you see in films before you get tired of them. The Academy couldn't even give the Oscar to the right person from Airport either, they gave it to Helen instead of Maureen. This film only recieved 10 Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, because it was a box office hit and because the studio spent a lot of money on ads for it. People say it's a classic because it started the disaster movies, I say it's a disaster and a piece of junk. The real disaster movie came with ""The Poseidon Adventure.""

939554,3,630491010X,"It may not have been obvious at the time, but 1970 signaled a landmark change in Hollywood cinema.  The release of the movie ""Airport"" marked the debut of Hollywood's decade-long obsession with disaster.  The success of ""Airport"" established a general formula followed by all disaster flicks and inspired countless imitators (not the least of which involved THREE separate sequels to ""Airport"").  The basic plot outline involves a suicidal man who just lost his job who decides to end it all by blowing himself and an entire plane out of the sky.  He doesn't manage to do destroy the plane, but he does damage it severely and it's up to the plane's captain to land the it safely and the airport director to orchestrate the safe landing in the midst of a driving snow storm.  This movie introduced the 'failing marriage and other woman' plot device to the disaster formula as there was not just one, but TWO male leads that experience that phenomenon.  Burt Lancaster, as the airport director, ignores his wife while consorting with his secretary during the crisis, and Dean Martin, as the plane's captain, has a very worried wife on the ground while his own concerns (in addition to saving the plane) are directed towards the stewardess he is having an affair with (and who is carrying his child).  It also introduced the theory that George Kennedy should be in as many disaster films as possible (as witnessed by the fact that he was in every ""Airport"" movie as well as ""Earthquake"").  It certainly did not warrant the 10 Academy Award nominations and 1 Academy Award win (for Support Actress by Helen Hayes as a mousy stowaway).  But, the freshness of this type of movie likely swayed audiences and the academy.  Yet, this is an entertaining flick and worth the time invested to see it.",1025827200,,1788,4.775974025974026
939555,4,630491010X,"The cars and clothing styles are hopelessly dated, its portrayal of gender roles is about as politically incorrect as you can get, it gave birth to a genre many of us love to hate, and it's probably best remembered today as the inspiration for one of the great movie parodies of all time.  In other words, what's not to love about ""Airport""?
Granted, most of the movie's entertainment value is unintentional from today's point of view.  The one overtly humorous side-story, featuring Helen Hayes as a repeat-offending stowaway, is amusing as ever; but the movie's efforts at more serious fare are the real farces.  The airport manager's marriage troubles which happen to come to a head just as the worst snowstorm in a decade hits and his unnaturally stoic response, the hysterical wife of the movie's villain, the hamhanded attempt at addressing the issue of abortion (which was still illegal in most parts of the U.S. at the time), and perhaps most of all, the casting of Dean Martin as the pilot who saves the day...none of these come even close to being convincing, but they're definitely entertaining!  If you're among the legions of Gen-Xers who know all the lines to ""Airplane!"" by heart, it's a scream to see the original characters, dialogues and events that movie satirizes; they're fairly easy to pick out.
The primary storyline, of course, concerns an airplane in jeopardy and a crew racing against time to bring the passengers to safety.  Sure, it's typical disaster-movie fare, but it's not quite as predictable as you might expect, and the special effects are well-done considering their vintage.  (It's also fairly low-key compared to most of the mega-budget messes this genre has spawned more recently; this is actually kind of refreshing.)  Even if you know how the flight and all the side stories end, the movie as a whole stands up to endless repeated viewings for anyone who likes late-60s kitsch - there's so much of it here that you're sure to notice something new and noteworthy every time.
No one will ever mistake it for one of the all-time greats, but ""Airport"" will always be good for a laugh - however accidental.",1024963200,,2142,4.852054794520548

Excellent theatrical sound and anamorphic widescreen picture for maximum resolution even on your big screen.  The movie score is a classic, too, and sounds great.

939558,4,630491010X,"Most modern movies rely on special effects as their drawing card, and consequently many of the modern Hollywood disaster blockbusters with stunning effects have suffered with a poor plot.  Airport is a classic disaster film from the days in which producers had to rely on a suspenseful plot to keep viewers interested.  Rather than feed us dramatic images of Titanic disaster, it feeds us with the drama and suspense of a great plot.  It doesn't have the special effects, but the plot is one that puts many modern movies to shame.  Of course, the plot is taken straight from Arthur Hailey's enormously successful 1968 book ""Airport"".  The great plot not only made the book a success, but it also makes this movie a success.  In fact ""Airport"" spawned a succession of disaster movies, but retains the privilege of being one of the first and greatest.
....  Can you believe it - a blockbuster suspense movie with a G rating?  Today that's unimaginable.  Not to say that ""Airport"" is completely clean.  There were a couple incidences of blasphemy (albeit barely noticeable)/  And although infidelity wasn't shown on screen, it was certainly implied and its consequences (a pregnancy out of wedlock) formed an integral part of the plot.  Both of the main male characters had broken marriages, and it was unfortunate that the plot tried to arouse sympathy for the immoral relationship of a pilot with a younger woman at the expense of his moral obligations to his wife.  On the other hand, while mature themes such as pregnancy and abortion were raised, yet in the end it was a pro-life alternative that was presented in a positive light.  While discerning viewers will want to be aware of these moral ambiguities, you will be pleased to know they are not dominant and do not substantially prevent enjoyment of the movie.  Unlike most blockbusters, we are spared any gory scenes or lust for the eyes, and the focus is on the plot.
And the plot is a good one, with several subplots.  A busy airport manager is faced with blizzard conditions that threaten to force his airport to close.  To make matters worse, he has to deal with a bogged plane blocking a runway, angry neighbourhood residents protesting at excessive noise, and an incoming flight with a stowaway ... and a mentally ill suicide bomber.  The acting of the stowaway, by the way is superb - Helen Hayes won an Academy Award for her efforts, and the movie is worth seeing alone for her brilliant acting of the little old lady in her seventies.  The role of the chief mechanic - an arrogant practical thinker devoid of emotion - was also well played.
Sure this movie is dated.  It comes from a time where smoking on aircraft was common, and where aircraft security was so lax it was possible for stowaways to practically walk on board.  The acting isn't always convincing, and the special effects seem somewhat prehistoric.  But nothing can beat a clean movie with a great storyline with a suspenseful ending, and this is one classic disaster film that will keep you riveted.  Modern advances in movie making have often been accompanied by a retreat in morals and story-line.  This is one good movie that demonstrates that sometimes older is better.",1015372800,4,3205,4.785454545454545

Alfred Newman's pulsating samba score and George Seaton's well-paced direction give ""Airport"" a distinct advantage over earlier and later extrapolations on its theme. While much of the drama is formulaic, the acting is generally good, and the casting includes some all-time greats in the entertainment field. The scene in which a priest crosses himself and simultaneously slaps a whining passenger is a gem, only to be treasured fully in widescreen.

However, as with all the Goodtimes DVD's I have, I can't understand why they don't put anything extra on it. For example the original trailer would be nice (which is on the Internet Movie Database incidentally). Goodtimes should go to Ebay, and spent $US20 on the presskits and stuff like that, and put the stuff on the DVD. It would certainly make it nicer and more 'period' oriented.

939624,5,630491010X,"The line of dialogue in my review title is one of my favorite lines from 1970's ""Airport"", which is recognized by some as the very first ""All-Star Disaster Movie"" ever made. (Although, I suppose you might get an argument regarding that particular distinction from fans of a similar type disaster-in-the-skies flick -- 1954's ""The High And The Mighty"".)

""Airport"" has long been a personal favorite of mine, despite a script that is filled to the brim with convenient contrivances and despite the rather low-quality ""special effects"" (it's not too difficult for the viewer to visualize several stagehands off camera moving the airplane's set back and forth by hand to simulate turbulence; and the shots of the Boeing 707 in flight reveal the easily-noticeable fact that the flying jetliner we see in the film is obviously just a toy).

But those weaknesses are overcome many times over (IMHO) by a genuinely tense story and some good acting performances. By the time this sleek 137-minute drama comes in for a landing for its final act, it's fairly easy to forgive the THREE separate cases of adultery that have been spelled out in previous portions of this ""G""-Rated motion picture (I've always been a bit perplexed as to how this movie was able to garner such a lenient MPAA U.S.A. rating, considering the adult-related subject matter eluded to throughout the script).

And, by the end of this lengthy cinematic ride, the viewer might even feel a little bit of compassion for ""Mister Fourth Row"" (as I call him), the very rude and obnoxious passenger who boards Rome-bound ""Trans Global Airlines"" Flight #2 in Chicago on that very snowy night when everything seems to go wrong at the fictitious ""Lincoln International Airport"".

My made-up ""Mr. Fourth Row"" moniker for the out-of-sorts airline traveller stems from one of the several funny lines of dialogue spoken by this irritable Trans Global flyer throughout the film. His name in the movie is actually ""Marcus Rathbone"", and he's played by Peter Turgeon. Some fans of the ""Dark Shadows"" television series might recognize him. He played a doctor on that ghoulish soap opera in 1967.

Rathbone had ""specifically asked for the fourth row"" when he bought his ticket for Trans Global Flight 2, but the gate agent was unable to accommodate his request.

Anyway, Mr. Rathbone/""Fourth Row"" comes up with several laugh-aloud gems during the movie, and, in fact, it is Rathbone himself (when you come to think about it) who is somewhat responsible for the fate of Flight 2.

Besides the secondary (and hilarious) character of Marcus ""4th Row"" Rathbone, ""Airport"" offers up a veritable smorgasbord of popular Hollywood names to fill the theater marquee. Let's have a gander at the cast roster (plus a memorable ""Airport"" quote from each of them).......

>> There's Burt Lancaster as ""Mel Bakersfeld"", the Lincoln Airport General Manager. .... ""It's time for you and all the other commissioners to start fighting for a bond issue that will finance THIS kind of an airport -- instead of running around checking to see if the toilets flush!""

>> The very lovely Jean Seberg as ""Tanya Livingston"", who is an executive for ""Trans Global"". .... ""The airlines won't do a thing about it {stowaways}, and she {Mrs. Quonsett} knows it. Crafty little old biddy!""

>> Dean Martin as ""Captain Vernon Demerest"", one of the pilots of the crippled-in-flight Boeing 707 jetliner. .... ""Are you guys sleeping down there?! We need help! If we're brought in on {runway} two-two, there'll be a broken airplane and a lot of dead people! We need two-niner! So you call Lincoln, mister, and turn the screws! And tell that airport manager to get off his penguin butt, and clear that runway!!""

>> A stunning Jacqueline Bisset as ""Gwen Meighen"", a stewardess aboard Flight 2. .... ""I'm afraid I was careless and stopped taking the pills because they were making me gain weight. So, instead of being plump, I'm pregnant.""

>> George Kennedy as ""Joe Patroni"", the gruff, no-nonsense TWA maintenance expert. .... ""If you had any GUTS we'd be on the runway by now!"" .... ""Who do you think you're talking to, some kid who fixes bicycles?! I know every inch of the 707! Take the wings off this, and you could use it as a tank! This plane is built to withstand anything -- except a BAD PILOT!!""

>> Van Heflin as the disturbed Flight 2 passenger ""D.O. Guerrero"". .... ""No! Stay back! Don't come any closer!!""

>> Maureen Stapleton as ""Inez Guerrero"", the wife of the bomb-toting ""D.O."" (and she's wonderful here). .... ""His last job -- they found something missing -- some dynamite!""

>> Helen Hayes as the likeable and cunningly-resourceful stowaway ""Mrs. Ada Quonsett"". .... ""I think you should tell them, my dear -- very often elderly people can't tolerate garlic -- gives them gas."" :)

>> Barry Nelson as ""Captain Anson Harris"", another pilot in control of Flight #2. .... ""Mayday! Mayday! Trans Global Two, explosive decompression! Making emergency descent!""

>> And then there's Dana Wynter as ""Cindy Bakersfeld"", Mel's very-easy-to-dislike wife (no wonder Mel spends so much time at the airport). .... ""There's someone else, Mel. And there has been for quite some time."" ... {pause} ... ""You had no idea, had you? Too busy to even consider the possibility.""

>> In smaller roles, look for Barbara Hale, Lloyd Nolan, Gary Collins, Whit Bissell, and Lisa Gerritsen.

Some of the best parts of ""Airport"" (for me anyway) take place during the many scenes on the ground, in the airport, prior to Flight 2's departure for Rome, Italy. The sense of really being at a busy airport during the height of a major snowstorm is fully realized, IMO, during these on-the-ground segments of the film. And the plush-looking executive offices which loom over the main terminal of the airport offer up a nice (and elegant) touch of class throughout the movie.

""Airport"" is based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Arthur Hailey (also highly recommended). George Seaton directed the movie and is also given a writing credit as well. Henry Hathaway, although uncredited, also directed a few portions of the movie (some of the outdoor scenes). Ross Hunter was the producer.

The music score for this motion picture was composed (with style) by Alfred Newman. The title theme always is good for a few shivers down the spine when I crank it up (especially via the nicely-done Surround Sound audio that this DVD provides). Newman received a ""Best Original Score"" Oscar nomination for his energetic ""Airport"" musical composition. On a sad note, Mr. Newman died just two weeks before ""Airport"" hit theater screens. He passed away on February 17, 1970. He was 68.

""Airport"", to the surprise of many people (especially now, in retrospect), received an impressive 10 Academy Award nominations in 1970, including a chance at winning ""Best Picture"" of the year. But ""Patton"" won that coveted honor.

Other major Oscar nominations for ""Airport"" included two nods for ""Best Supporting Actress"", with both Helen Hayes and Maureen Stapleton competing in that category. And it was the 70-year-old Hayes who took home the Oscar statue.

Some ""AIRPORT"" Trivia And Misc. Stuff About The Film..........

>> ""Airport"" premiered in U.S. theaters on Thursday, March 5th, 1970.

>> Many of the interior airport scenes that were shot for the movie were filmed at a real U.S. airport -- at Minneapolis-St. Paul International in Minnesota.

>> The Boeing 707 aircraft shown in the film was leased from Flying Tigers Airlines, and re-painted to display the livery of ""Trans Global Airlines"" (TGA), which was an airline name invented by the filmmakers. Tragically, that exact plane crashed in Brazil on March 21, 1989, killing all three people on board the 707-300. In addition, eighteen people on the ground died as a result of that crash, as the jet plowed into a series of houses after stalling while trying to land.

>> Only one B707 was actually used during the filming of ""Airport"", although the impression of THREE different planes is eluded to in the picture -- one being the aircraft that gets stuck in the snow at the very start of the film; another being the plane on the Rome-bound flight; and the third being the jet that we see take off early in the movie, which causes a local homeowner some grief due to the rattling dishes on the dining-room table as the jet roars overhead. I've always thought that this illusion of three separate 707s was a pretty slick ""sleight-of-planes"" trick performed by the filmmakers.

>> Helen Hayes was not present at the Academy Awards ceremony to accept her ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar in person. Actress Rosalind Russell accepted the award on behalf of Hayes.

>> ""Airport"" earned a very impressive $100,489,151 at the box office during its theatrical run in 1970, making it a bonafide ""blockbuster"" by pretty much anyone's standards. When adjusted for inflation, that $100-Million domestic gross equates to approximately $400,000,000 in 21st-century dollars.

>> The film's production budget was ten million dollars.

>> Goof/Flub? ... Ever notice this gaffe in the film (I consider it a gaffe anyway)? --- In the scene where ""Mrs. Quonsett"" enters and exits the restroom, there's something very strange here. The oddity being: the bathroom door opens OUTWARD, instead of inward. Which means, of course, that every time a person swings that door open, a passing pedestrian in the corridor is potentially going to get knocked right on his or her hind quarters! LOL! Now, since when are doors manufactured to open OUT, into oncoming foot traffic? (I'm guessing that the bathroom door we see here was probably not a normal part of ""St. Paul International Airport"". Perhaps it was just added for the filmmakers. Or, maybe that specific scene was filmed in Hollywood. I'm not sure. But it struck me as funny anyway.)

--------------

GoodTimes Home Video has offered up two separate DVD versions of ""Airport"". There's a Full-Frame (Pan-&-Scan) version; and an Anamorphic Widescreen variant, which comes much more highly recommended. My advice would be to stay away from the inferior Full-Frame disc, and watch the film the way it was seen on movie-house screens in 1970 -- in Widescreen.

The enhanced 2.35:1 Widescreen image sparkles on this DVD. My hat is off to GoodTimes Home Video for this effort. Audio sounds great too, thanks to a full-bodied Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound Stereo track that's been used for this disc. If you're looking for ""Special Bonus Features"", though, you'll have to search elsewhere, because this GoodTimes disc is bare to the bone as far as extra stuff goes. But at least the film looks great, in its original Widescreen ""Scope"" format.

Universal Studios Home Video released this film on DVD in February 2004, as one of four movies in its ""Airport Terminal Pack: The Franchise Collection"". The three ""Airport"" sequels are along for the ride as well in that Universal release (which is a very nice 2-Disc set, btw). It appears to my eyeballs that this GoodTimes DVD video transfer of ""Airport"" is pretty much identical to the newer 2004 Universal DVD print. The Universal edition may be just a tad cleaner-looking, but any differences are fairly negligible, IMO. The audio for the film got two new souped-up 5.1-channel soundtracks on that Universal version, however.

In closing the ""Airport"" (review)........

For a fun piece of pioneering ""disaster movie"" history, and for a pre-""9/11"" glimpse at how absurdly easy it was for a stowaway to walk onto a jet airliner bound for another continent without anybody noticing, and for just a plain old good time at the movies ... it'd be hard to beat the original ""Airport"".

939625,4,630491010X,"I'm going to do something I thought I'd never do; give GoodTimes Video an A+ for this DVD.  They took a step into the 20th century for their Thirtieth Anniversary DVD release of Airport.
I held onto my old Airport VHS tape well after I stepped up to DVDs, because no one had released a widescreen DVD of the classic disaster film.  GoodTimes had earlier released a DVD of Airport, but it was in standard aspect ration, so I passed on it. Then last week, there it was, Airport, WIDESCREEN, it said.  And when I picked it up to look at the features on the back, I couldn't believe my eyes.  GoodTimes not only released it in widescreen, but in anamorphic widescreen, AND in Dolby surround.  And the price is more than perfect.
You get no extras, just the movie.  But it's beautiful, and it's the original, shown for the first time as it was on the big screen in perhaps thirty years.
If you love classic films, then this movie is probably on your list of must-haves.  This is not a perfect film, but it works.  From Dean Martin's better than average performance, to Helen Hayes' Oscar winning portrayal of a fiesty trickster that sneaks onto planes.  By today's standards the plot may seem to move slowly, but if you view it in it's 70's context, it's actually more like a roller coaster ride that takes off at a slow glide, tops a hill, and flies down the other side into a fairly tense climax.  Don't be afraid of this DVD.  For ten bucks you could get a real crappy DVD.  But in this case, you strike gold.
Let's hope this is a new and lasting trend for GoodTimes DVDs.  Low prices, good movies.  GoodTimes.",992736000,27,1608,4.388513513513513

939627,3,630491010X,"It's not every day you see a movie that shows Dean Martin as more of an actor than you remembered, and Helen Hayes as rather less of one, but ""Airport"" is like that. It's a rich, plotty plum pudding of a film that features dozens of performances from actors at every level of competence. Interestingly enough, it all works. Martin is quite credible and good as an airline pilot, even when the dialogue he's given is contrived and movie-ish. Hayes is a little over-the-top in her acclaimed performance as a little-old-lady stowaway; it's nothing Spring Byington couldn't have done just as well, and cheaper.  What the heck, Hayes had reached the point in her career where she could do as she pleased.
Other people in the film? The late Jean Seberg is in it, looking amazingly like Kim Novak in a Hitchcock film- complete with grey Edith Head suit and a crush on an older man, played dully by Burt Lancaster. Barbara Hale (""Della Street"" in the old ""Perry Mason"" series) is great as an earth mother married to Dean Martin; watch for her little scene toward the end of the movie when she realises her marriage is over. Van Heflin is painfully accurate in his portrayal of a demented loser who wants to suicide-bomb a 707 so his wife will have his flight insurance as compensation for the horrible life she's had as his spouse. And as the wife, Maureen Stapleton is absolutely wonderful. She's uncomprehending, incoherent, and agonisingly aware by turns; everytime she's on-screen, nothing else matters.
Other roles involve Jacqueline Bisset as a stewardess- not the highest and best use of her talent- and yes, that's Gary Collins as a navigator. George Kennedy plays a TWA mechanic who saves the day; I don't like his performance, but Kennedy went on to play the same role in this film's sequels, so he must have been pleasing someone with his work. True film buffs will be delighted by one of the bit players- the mother of a teen-aged nerd who is on the ill-fated 707 flight. It's none other than Virginia Grey, Joan Crawford's blonde co-worker at the perfume counter in ""The Women"".  And ""Airport"" features the last screen appearance of the late, great Jessie Royce Landis; she's a rich woman who tries to do a little diamond smuggling.  Her accomplice is her poodle, who travels in- what else?- a Louis Vuitton carrier.
The film itself? Well, it's big-time movie-making, circa 1970; everything about it is flossy and expensive and well-done. There is an astounding special effect when the loser sets off a bomb on the plane.  It's got enough plot and enough stars for four movies. And in its own way, it's quite good.

Whats also nice, is that the widscreen is 1:33, so it fills up almost the whole screen.",982540800,2,263,4.117647058823529
939629,5,630491010X,"Airport is surprisingly faithful to Arthur Hailey's book, with regards to the screenplay. Jacqueline Bisset is perfectly cast as a stewardess, as is Helen Hayes as the stowaway passenger. Van Heflin and Maureen Stapleton share many poignant moments, and a little seen Barbara Hale rounds out the shining stars very well. While I have seen this movie called ""slow and plodding"", you actually get quite involved with all the characters and know about their motivation before the crucial scene in the air where it all comes to pass. Of course, this huge success at box office has been let down by a... DVD release - it's in Pan & Scan. Why anyone would do this on a DVD is beyond me. Also, it's lacking a lot of extra features that a film of this calibre should have on a DVD. Regardless, the film is an awesome piece of entertainment, faithful to the novel (without the ""boring parts"") and is supurbly acted by a stellar cast. It deserved to be the runaway worldwide success it was.",980812800,18,980,4.605714285714286

There is an intro showing the Universal logo, some miscellaneous stuff and the last thing this on it is a statement that ""comments or statements made in any interviews are not those of...blah, blah, blah"". That's it......but no movie!! I didn't open if for about 2 months and imagine my surprise.  Can't even return it now! This is so frustrating!! Do not recommend you buy this DVD.",1524614400,,442,4.666666666666667
