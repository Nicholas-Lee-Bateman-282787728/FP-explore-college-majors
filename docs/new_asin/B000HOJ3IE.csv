2639468,3,B000HOJ3IE,"To be blunt, this set of disks was disappointing.  While it has some high points (see below), it is largely a collection of NASA-created movie segments, with no narrative, no cohesive presentation, and, to a large extent,poor editing.

There are some notable highlights, however.  The Apollo 11 lunar excursion is included in its entirety (likely one of the few disks that will ever show the whole thing).  The producers put work into this particular segment, providing the viewer the option of viewing the slow-scan (1 frame/sec) 16 mm movie shot from the static position of Buzz Aldrin's LEM window (in color) or the black/white video image that the world saw back in July of 1969.  The lead-up to the excursion, the lunar landing, is also of considerable merit.

I recall such TV coverage; America was swept up by Apollo (at least in 1968/1969).  Gas stations gave out free LEM kits that kids could build and TV news reporting was good back then and gave generous treatment.

Here are the problems with this disk set:

- In several instances, the audio and video are taken from totally different events.  For example, video showing the shirt-sleeved Apollo 11 crew is accompanied by pre-launch (!) audio.  Similarly, footage of the crew suiting up is accompanied by unrelated audio.  These errors are awful in that they deprive the viewer of context and can only confuse those less familiar with the events.  The producers could have provided 2nd audio narrative or even closed captions to provide context, but they did not.  They could have provided some written guidance in the form of a booklet, but did not.  One is left with the impression that significant parts of the video was hurriedly thrown together.  Such segments will only confuse new viewers.

- Filmed events are not presented in chronological order of the mission (for example, preparations to move into the LEM from the CSM follow the landing footage!).  As noted before, there is no voice or text narative (that could have been easily provided) to help the viewer sort out this jumble).

- Some segments are very boring...and I say this as an Apollo fan and as a research scientist who is acquainted with boring things!  The worst is the endless Saturn 5 count-down video.  It doesn't do justice to the mission.  Helpful audio could have provided context (basic historical facts). But none was provided.

Having said that, there is one thing that this DVD set does NOT engage in, for which I am very grateful: they do not sensationalize the procedings.  Several higher-budget documentaries (see on the History Channel and Discovery) play loose with the Apollo program, inserting annoying graphics, inane fast-cut edits, and misleading drama.  This disk set is low key.  Too low in some cases, but, thankfully, it is not frenetic.

Please note that not all reviews that may appear subsequent to mine may  be independent, but may have been penned by those associated with this DVD.  Beware glowing reviews!

Recommendation:  If you love the Apollo-era history, this may be of significant interest to you, particularly for the historic landing and EVA footage.  However, do not expect this disk set to educate those not familar with Apollo or even provide a coherent narrative of events.",1180396800,4,3256,4.950184501845018
2639469,5,B000HOJ3IE,"It was like watching the mission all over agian. Apart form having a interest in manned space flight and that I had grown up in the 60's, now

I can show my children the wounder of June 1969. Apollo 11's achievement of landing on the moon was the start of the lunar missions. A total of six landings where conpleted between 1969 to 1972. I hope we are going back soon as Eugene Cernan stated at the end of Apollo Seventeen ""As we leave the Moon and Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came, and God willing we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. As I take these last steps from the surface for some time to come, I'd just like to record that America's challenge of today has forged man's dsetiny of tomorrow, God speed to the crew of Apollo Seventeen."" .",1180051200,,764,4.268965517241379
8140616,5,B000HOJ3IE,"Excellent and very in-depth video record of the first manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 11; Space Science Series is an alternate version with different packaging than another set released the same year.",1395878400,,205,5.4375
8140617,5,B000HOJ3IE,"Forty years have now passed since the epic voyage of Apollo 11. Unbelievable! This 3-disc series enables the viewer/listener to relive it all--in full detail.

Full footage is included of the landing process itself, the stay on the moon, and the ascent of the upper stage of the LEM back into lunar orbit. Other aspects of the mission, such as the rendezvous and docking of Columbia and Eagle, are covered in less detail.

The footage from the first walks on the moon recount the triumph and the uncertainty of man's first walk on the surface of a foreign celestial object. Armstrong steps on the moon, and comments on how it feels to walk upon it, as well as the fact that his feet sink only about an eighth of an inch into the surface. (There had earlier been concern that the lunar surface may contain patches of loose dust into which an astronaut could sink). Armstrong also comments on the level deployment of the LEM. (This put concerns to rest about the LEM potentially tipping to a point at which re-launch of the upper stage would be impossible). Armstrong picks up a contingency sample. He is joined by Aldrin on the surface. They deploy the American flag, the laser experiment, and the seismograph. They collect many rock samples. Mission control asks them to step before a camera. President Nixon calls them, and offers his congratulations.

All good things must come to an end, and the astronauts return to the LEM. A parting shot shows the lunar surface, complete with the deployed flag and numerous human footprints.",1245628800,2,1531,4.7481203007518795
8140618,5,B000HOJ3IE,"This is an interesting collection of reviews and rebuttals. Now, for full disclosure, I have worked with Spacecraft Films in the past, negotiating ""use rights"" of their footage for TV documentaries and the like. I have found everyone there, especially, Mark, to be helpful, fair, responsive and just generally great folks. Not easy to do when you are operating on the margins he must have to.

More to the point: how can anyone not understand that these DVD collections are of a more ""archival"" nature before purchasing? It was certainly clear to me when I ordered the materials (way before I had spoken to anyone at the company). Of course, for me that was the beauty of it. If I wanted a chopped-up, music-bedded, re-interpreted version of Apollo, I would have watched the ""Modern Marvels: Apollo 11"" that I wrote and directed a few years back (and yes, Mark was there to help out on that project too). But that is NOT what I wanted; I wanted to relive the moments in their fullest context, ie uncut and original. Which is exactly what Spacecraft Films has delivered.

It seems to have been generally overlooked by the detractors here that these collections represent a remarkable investment in restoring these materials- something that nobody else, including NASA, has ever done on this scale. To find the best originals (never an easy task with the National Archives, trust me!), pay for the very expensive digital transfers, enhance the material and package for sale is a hugely expensive undertaking. I for one am grateful that Spacecraft Films has taken this on, and wonder every time I look at the DVD's how the heck they can make a profit. But I will be forever indebted to them in any case- history is preserved.

A side note: the last time I personally went to the National Archives (before they moved to MD), one box of materials I found was wedged behind a leaky steam radiator heater. The archival materials were, to put it mildly, imperiled.  And to date, I have been unable to find ANY recording of the Apollo 12 moonwalks without ""audio hits"" from the tapes being having been improperly stored. Without people like Mark, many of these materials could be lost forever.

In closing, I would like to encourage buyers to do their homework before ordering. If you want a more ""narrative"" version of these events, there are lots of old, grainy, badly transferred documentaries about Apollo to be had, But none of them will transport you into the moment like these will.

PS: RE delivery times, I cannot inform. I received my products within a week and was pleased as can be. I have noticed that the SF website informs that some titles are ""not in hand,"" so to speak, so I would encourage shoppers to either hold of on ordering those titles or, if in doubt, contact the company.",1243123200,,2788,4.714579055441479
8140619,2,B000HOJ3IE,"I gave this product a 2 out of 5 stars not because the product is defective in any way shape or form. I'm a 53 year old American Male who grew up during that time and remember the events very well. It happened to have been a big part of my childhood. It is one of the best things that happened in the decades of the 1960s and early 1970s. I love the fact that some one would bother to release videos of such good quality. These films have also been enhanced so the color and clarity are better then I remember them to be.

  I can also speak from the prospective of having purchased just about everything Spacecraft Films has produced.  I have quite a good collection of space related films in my library that I repeatedly return to every chance I get.  The memories are quite uplifting and rewording to me as a positive note in our countries history.  They are also a good way to introduce my son to a historical event and to give him a taste of what it was like to be a child from my generation.

  Having said that I find Mr. M. Gray's ""Spacecraft Films Producer"" defense of his companies product laudable. But my complaint is that you can't seem to receive some of the products you order. I have three items on order at the present time one of which has taken more then a year to receive. The other two have taken a few months now. There is not one customer that should be interested in waiting that long to receive any product.

  One title was Apollo 11: To The Moon at $46.59 total cost. The order Date was 10/22/2007. The other two titles are Developing Project Apollo and Gemini Flight Controller Orientation. Both of these titles cost $19.99 a piece. The order for them was 1/7/2009.  All of these films are probably wonderfully produced but I'll never know if I never view them for myself. If I never receive them how will I ever know?

  The issue for me isn't the quality of their products. I already consider the quality to be a cut above everyone else, but the ability to receive what was previously paid for by me as a customer. All I can tell you future purchasers is for this company don't order anything that says ""pre-order"" or when it says ""in stock, in replication"". You are likely to be disappointed.  I hope that this problem will be corrected some time in the near future.",1238976000,,2297,4.329439252336448
8140620,5,B000HOJ3IE,"DVD is fantastic, great scenes, it is replete of information.

8140621,5,B000HOJ3IE,"The Apollo 11: Men On the Moon DVD collection is simply a collection of NASA archival audio and video footage of the first moon landing mission. It is well researched, well produced, and well presented. Some may find the content of the three DVD collection boring (as has been noted in other reviews) but for me this raw and unvarnished record of one of the greatest events in history is entirely absorbing, and fascinating.

The content of the DVD collection is far too compehensive to list here, so I will summarize some of the highlights. Of course what may be considered highlights to me may be endlessly boring to others. The hour long prelaunch countdown for instance is presented almost entirely unedited and is a greatly satisfying experience. It is wonderful to be able to watch the events unfold as they did in 1969 with no media interuptions or over dubbed commentary. The moon landing is presented with multiple audio tracks to choose from including the air-to-groung loop, the flight controllers loop, and the audio from the on-board tape recorders. The audio tracks are synchronised with the 16mm footage of the landing that was shot through the LEM window, again the entire landing sequence from PDI to touchdown is presented unedited allowing the viewer to be eyewitness to the historical event. Following the landing there are multiple re-runs of the footage as Armstrong and Aldrin describe the touchdown, the audio for this portion is taken from the post flight technical debrief and is a fresh and fascinating insiders view of this amazing event, this sequence was the highlight of the DVD for me. The more you watch the DVD set the more you appreciate the research that went into compiling this collection.

Of course nothing is perfect and my complaint is that the downlink video is taken from NASA kinescope recordings, and not from video tape. Of course NASA has famously lost the original video tape, and the kinescope recordings ARE the official archival record of the event. However I wish that the producers had been able to obtain the moonwalk in it's original broadcast video format from CBS, NBC, ABC, or any one of a number of likely sources.",1202428800,,2174,4.872972972972973
8140622,5,B000HOJ3IE,"I have not ever seen documentation like this regarding Apollo 11, but given it's importance in the world's history, it is amazing to watch.  This is first, for me, a nice break from the frantic camera angle changes that we see in any form of media today.  The suspense of going through two hours of launch material before the actual launch may be boring to some, but it requires a lot of thought for those who really want to know about this event.  One wonders what the astronauts are thinking as they await over 7 million pounds of thrust to push them into orbit.  One thinks about the detail necessary to take 1969 technology all the way to the moon and not miss! It is still amazing today, and Spacecraft Videos has captured it all here and thankfully had the patience to not cut and paste a lot of valuable history.  I can not recommend this video enough.",1201392000,,859,4.4113924050632916
8140623,4,B000HOJ3IE,Overall this is a fairly good DVD set to get. I found it a bit long winded in parts. Looking at out of focus numbers on a control panel doesn't really do it for me. I would have like to have more commentary about what is happening. Besides that I found it really interesting and enjoyed watching it. If you are into the Apollo missions then you want be disappointed with this DVD set.,1184284800,,384,4.202702702702703
8140624,5,B000HOJ3IE,"Can't believe in conspiracies after watching this amazing footage.

Nope. The Apollo 11 Moon Expedition was not staged in the Yuha Desert.

Educational experience!

 An insight into Apollo 11 research, preparation, development, training, the launch, the flight, moon approach & landing, Armstrong's one small step & one giant leap, the work & experiments the men did up there, the placing of the American Flag, the return voyage back to mother, etc. etc.

Do it again NASA!

Be patient, perhaps watch it in steps.

You can see non-human alien off in the distance in a couple of frames, when the guys are bouncing around up there. Amazing!",1181088000,,638,4.962264150943396
8140625,5,B000HOJ3IE,"This is a note from the producer, and despite what the last reviewer asserts, anytime we post something about one of our products we do it in the clear, so you can see the source, any other reviews posted are from other independent customers.

Spacecraft Films set out with our series to provide those who have a deep interest in U.S. space exploration with access to the primary source material, in as good a quality as we could achieve. Because of this we do not filter the product in the manner of documentaries or live media. We do this on purpose, so that you have a chance to view the primary source material the way it really happened. The material is kept in many places and is in various states of preservation. We make new transfers and go through extensive editing just to bring the material all back together in one place.

Anyone's opinion is just fine with us, but I must clarify some items mentioned below.

The ""audio and video taken from totally different events"" was done on purpose, they aren't ""errors."" The reasoning behind this is that nearly all of the filmed portions that we have provided were shot silent. Rather than leave them silent or provide an obvious commentary, we elected to use that audio space to provide you with more primary audio-only material surrounding the mission. In order to do this, and because we often provide multiple camera angles of an event, for some tracks you get footage and audio that are from separate events, increasing the amount of material we're able to present.

Two of the television transmissions are presented on disc 3, because of the size limitations of the first DVD. I suppose this might be considered ""out of chronological order,"" but the chapter booklet clearly states that the two transmissions are ""on the way"" to the moon. This isn't a mistake. It was done to allow the EVA to be kept all on one disc, and is noted correctly.

As for some tracks being boring... it all depends upon your level of interest and what portions of the mission your interests focus.

The Saturn V countdown was presented uncut because of the charm it holds for many of those who remember the countdowns. We've received numerous notes from folks who consider this one of the best tracks on the disc set.

Our sets aren't for those looking for a packaged, slick version of the mission. They are for those with a deep interest in being able to examine the record of the mission as it happened, without the errors introduced by the media filter and sensationalism.",1180828800,24,2512,4.656884875846501
