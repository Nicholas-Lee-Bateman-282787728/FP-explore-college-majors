8337355,1,B001R4XRLW,"There is nothing redeemable at all here.
Where to start there is so much wrong with this movie...
It is filmed, edited and acted exactly like a 80's pron movie, yes that bad.
There is no car chases, there is no car crashes, there is no acting ability, there is nothing here so move along please...

The sound varies wildly as does the hiss on the soundtrack almost like one of those old tape recorders that had auto record levels. It sounds like it was all dubbed in a large empty room no matter where they are.

This is the movie that makes Redline look good!",1257379200,,560,4.273584905660377
8337356,5,B001R4XRLW,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was hot...the script, the actors, especially the cars and the direction of the movie. I liked the fact that the screen writer actually trusted his audience with the complexity of a plot that's worthy of a mature audience. The film looks like its from a pre-existing genre and it is, but it differs in the most important way - it has a challenging plot. I loved it!! Lastly, I'm not sure which film the previous reviewer saw. It seems to me that the previous reviewer was bent on showcasing how credible and knowledgable he is about movies...I don't recall seeing any movies he's produced which disqualifies him from the expert point of view he would like everyone to believe he speaks from. So, put your glasses back on and try to keep your attention on the plot as opposed to waiting for a car to take off from the seaport and splash into the ocean - you're not thirteen anymore. Great movie - see it!!!!!!!",1253318400,2,940,4.502923976608187
