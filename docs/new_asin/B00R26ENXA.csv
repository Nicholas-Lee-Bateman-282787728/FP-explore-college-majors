I love the movie. I have studied the lives of the Mirabal sisters and I am gaining an appreciation for the hardships that the people of the Dominican Republic went through. This film is fantastic! This is the good about the DVD.

NOW THE BAD....I have purchased 2 DVDs. There is a data glitch about 2/3 through the movie; right about 33 minutes left in the movie. This glitch causes the movie to freeze and cannot be played further. I purchased one disk thinking something happened - a scratch or something. I even tried to doctor it. Nothing worked. So...I ordered a second. Same result. Therefore, I believe the manufacturer is at fault. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DISK BECAUSE OF THE GLITCH.

This is for the 2000 edition for $19.49.",1424131200,17,773,4.553956834532374
