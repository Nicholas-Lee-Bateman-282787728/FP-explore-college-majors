8764222,5,B01GWEDTJG,"A ""what if"" series about an alien ship showing up in orbit, but with no communication from it, fear runs wild.  The one day the Earth is covered by a ring of alien satellites that release carbon spores across the populated world.  The spores have sticky burrs on them so that people's clothing and other articles stick to them.  They range in sizes and no one knows what their for, after an extended period, the spores simply disintegrate into dust and blow away in the wind.  People start to notice that the generation being born after the spores disappeared are no longer only human, they now have a new organ in their brains that allow telepathic and other abilities.  They (the government) performs autopsies on some of the babies who died early on and find a way to replicate the organ with a surgically attached device that allows regular humans access to the Hive Mind (if you will.)  As the series goes on, it describes the new children as a superior race, able to multitask and now there is a new AI called Quincy that was built with parts pulled from orbit when the alien mother-ship also disintegrated in orbit, and now the Earth has rings from pole to pole, making space travel risky unless guided by Quincy, the AI.  The AI answers most of mankind's questions, but the U.S. Government has a backup of a Quincy like computer, just in case they need to take out the AI.  Quincy was sent to ensure telepathic communication between all of the Worlds in the System belonging to whoever sent the alien ship with its salvage for humanity to connect to them.  Of course this raises fear with the U.S. Government who bombs Quincy just as he is uploading into the internet, hitting him at about the 95% mark, so he's incapacitated unless he can finish the download from the ""Empire.""  Quincy was built using a box filled with entangled particles, allowing instant access to all the World in the Empire that sent the ship to Earth.  A scientist uses Virtual Reality to go back before Quincy was destroyed and replays Quincy uploading  himself into the Internet.  Slowly, he gets closer and closer to Quincy getting the full download, virtually.  When he finishes simulating the download, Quincy comes back with a vengeance.  He allows instant access to literally hundreds of civilization throughout our Galaxy.  This is Series one.  Series two is just as good, if not better.",1512950400,,2377,4.6891566265060245
