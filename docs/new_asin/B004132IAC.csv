8412544,1,B004132IAC,"I'm not sure why I wasted my money on this show. It is a terrible Superboy series. I think the worst aspect of it is the introduction of the whiny Chloe character. Plus, in the comics, Superboy wore his costume and was known to the residents of Smallville as opposed to this silly furtive version of his character. Other than the imbecilic Chloe character, his inability to fly was about the worst idea the writers had.

Save your time and money and find something better to watch.",1519776000,,481,4.528735632183908

8412547,5,B004132IAC,"I've been rewatching all of Smallville, and was very pleased with how well Season 3 held up. It starts out with Clark in Exile in Metropolis on red Kryptonite. It really was a great start to the season. This presents all kinds of problems for Clark throughout the season, including his relationship with Lana. Season 3 really gets away from the Freak of the Week, and does a really good job with the overall arc of the season. Perry White shows up in season 3 in a great little episode. Alicia Baker also shows up this season in one of my favorite episodes. Lex began the season stranded on an island and really begins his turn towards the dark side, so to speak. The season finishes up with another one of Smallville's great season finale's in Covenant. It really holds up well.",1513728000,,779,4.492957746478873
