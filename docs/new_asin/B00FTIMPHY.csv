8618587,1,B00FTIMPHY,"I'm quite biased here (one star is actually more than this film deserves) - I found out that my father was in this movie from IMDB.com. He plays the ""Indian Chief,"" despite being a very anglo man painted green. When I asked him about working on this film, he had literally no memories of having done so, but saw the footage and knew that it was him. So he had no memory of being in a movie (this is the only one he was ever in), no memories of shirtlessly carrying a torch around while being painted green, no memories of having jellybeans thrown at his face.

When I tell him that the director (Herschel Gordon Lewis) is an icon in his own way, he's thoroughly unimpressed. But I'm excited that my father got to work with the director of ""The Wizard of Gore,"" even if he doesn't remember having done so.

This movie is actually pretty bad, but one of those films that's tranfixingly so. It's hard to imagine children in the 1960's enjoying it in any way. The story, acting, and music are all community-theater level at best. Adults on mushrooms - they might enjoy it.",1418515200,,1068,4.388888888888889
