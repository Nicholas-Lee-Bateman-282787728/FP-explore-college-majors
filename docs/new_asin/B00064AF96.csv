2165441,5,B00064AF96,"The Wiggles are a rock band that play as much to the adults as they do our children. You can tell these guys are having fun and their enthusiasm is quite infectious. I highly recommend this DVD as a ""greatest hits"" of their songs and skits. You'll be humming or whistling their songs at work the next day.",1110067200,3,305,4.275862068965517
2165442,5,B00064AF96,"My two boys, who are 3 1/2 and 1 1/2, love the Wiggles, and this seems to be their new favorite video! Basically, it's a recording of a concert the group put on in Sydney, and they put on quite a show. The live orhcestra is wonderful, the wiggly dancers are there, and Santa Claus even makes an appearance! What more can you ask for? My kids spend pretty much the entire 70 minutes of the video on their feet dancing along with the Wiggles and the children in the audience. My older son is autistic, and he responds so much to the Wiggles and their videos, and this one is no exception! They play tons of the popular Wiggles' songs, the set is bright and colorful, and the Wiggles and their friends are up to their usual antics! A must have for a little Wiggles' lover!",1107475200,3,769,4.238095238095238
2165443,5,B00064AF96,"My daughter loves the Wiggles TV show and the other DVDs.  At 15 months, she mostly loves to dance to the songs.  I bought this DVD because I wanted the most music possible for her.  The Wiggles live DVD is wonderful!  She claps and dances to the songs and has a lot of fun while watching it.  I try to limit her tv time to 30 min. or so a day so we don't watch the entire show in one sitting as it is rather long.  We have not seen the Wiggles concert in person, but after watching this DVD I can't wait to take her.  They put on a great show and they are great at keeping the children's interest.  I really recommend this if your child is a Wiggles fan, I don't think you will be disappointed!",1107043200,,695,3.949640287769784
2165444,5,B00064AF96,"I have never written an Amazon review, but my 2-year-old LOVES The Wiggles so much, I had to put the word out.  ""Live Hot Potatoes"" is the first DVD I bought after wearing out ""Wiggle Time.""  It's so refreshing because I actually WANT to get up and perform the songs with my son.  The music and dancing is fabulous...these guys have tons of talent.  Even my husband loves them!  I recommend this along with ""Wiggle Time"" and ""Wiggle Bay"" to any parent like me who can't stomach Barney or the Teletubbies (makes my skin crawl).",1106524800,3,526,4.494736842105263
2165445,5,B00064AF96,"This is the best Wiggles DVD ever - and they are all great. My 20 month old daughter is mesmorized and dances the whole way through - not just a sit down and zone out DVD. That's why we love the Wiggles so much - they get kids (and adults) dancing. The songs are upbeat and fun and compared to most kids music relatively un-annoying, even after the millionth play. These blokes deserve all the success they are having.",1105920000,3,418,4.30379746835443
2165446,5,B00064AF96,"We have been to the Wiggles concert twice... I made my 3 year old son a scrapbook from it, he still talks about it, and acts out the Wiggles concert with his Wiggles guys and has shows in our playroom.... so when we got this video and saw that it was actually songs and scenes from the real RECENT Wiggles concert, he was sooooo thrilled!!! Even my 20 mth old daugher loves it!

For those who have been to the concert and liked it, it is awesome... and for those who couldn't make it.. now is the time to watch it right from the comfort of your own home!!!",1105747200,2,556,4.10091743119266
2165447,4,B00064AF96,"I bought this and had high hopes after Top of the Tots and Santa's Rockin' - those were not that good as far as the Wiggles go.

This new live show has a whole band on stage, elaborate sets and everyone appears to be singing.  My son, 2 yrs 2 mos, was very intereseted in the new format of a concert. They did more close-ups, split screens, etc, not just a wide shot of the stage as in older concert footage.

The only complaint I have is at times the words and their mouths seemed off on the DVD.  Not that they weren't singing, just a technical difficulty of the production of the DVD.  Extras are just so-so and I wish they would list the run time to tell the actual length of the feature show only. Over all, I'd say it's pretty darn good Wiggles.  And we have almost ALL of the dvds/vcr shows that there are!",1105488000,10,813,4.113924050632911

2165460,3,B00064AF96,"The DVD arrived on time, but it was defective.  the sound sync was totally off what their mouths were singing.  As this is a concert DVD it absolutely renders it unwatchable for my 5 year old.
but when I contacted them, they emailed back right away, were very nice, and said they would refund me immediately.  so I would recommend this seller.  I only rated it 3 instead of 5 because of the condition of the DVD not the service.",1337472000,,428,4.3125

2165465,5,B00064AF96,"My 2 year old LOVES the Wiggles. He has memorized every Wiggles video, sings, dances and has a great time. We went to the show at the HP Pavilion and it was a blast. The show in this video (in Sidney, Australia) was not exactly the same, but the fun and lively performances are a must-see if you have a Wiggles fan in the house. I highly recommend it.

2165479,4,B00064AF96,Of course my 2 yr old son is a HUGE fan of the Wiggles. We even saw them Live in February. Boy was he shocked when they came out on stage. So this dvd is always being watched. I am looking to extend his Wiggles dvd collection so he doesn't have to watch one dvd so much!!,1178928000,,271,3.7719298245614037
2165480,5,B00064AF96,"I like this one because it is a taped show and the ""improv"" stuff is pretty amusing. My daughter (she's 2) LOVES the Wiggles and will dance around the living room, signing and immitating the dancers. I like this one better than the one that just came out August, 2006. A word of caution...if you watch this with your kids, you WILL find yourself singing the sings to yourself during the day.",1155859200,,391,4.444444444444445

2165482,5,B00064AF96,I have a two year old son and he absolutely loves the Wiggles.  This DVD was perfect for him because he loves all of the songs on it.  If you are considering it I would strongly suggest it.  I bought the DVD and the CD.  One keeps him happy in the house and one in the vehicle.,1151884800,,277,3.807017543859649
2165483,2,B00064AF96,"I think to truly enjoy a Wiggles concert, one must attend it live.  Watching it taped -the audience cannot see the full stage and if we can, then the guys are quite small on the screen.  Sometimes they do three split screens to show what's happening all over the screen.  It's just not visually pleasing that way.  The wiggles can do so much more in a studio.  My 2 year old daughter is enjoying the DVD, but she is not getting up to sing or dance like for the Big Red Car.  No more live DVD's for me, thanks.",1148083200,,509,4.090909090909091
2165484,5,B00064AF96,"My 21-month old son loves The Wiggles and has a lot of their videos.  But if there is one single DVD of theirs that he brings to me personally, it's always ""Live Hot Potatoes.""  This live show from Sydney contains a ton of the best Wiggles songs and lots of funny and amusing skits as well.  The band is fantastic, and as another reviewer pointed out, this is indeed live music being cranked out here.  Captain Feathersword doing ""Eagle Rock"" is a definite highlight.

This is indeed a ""long"" video, but my son's attention never sways from it.  He's watched it a ton of times, and I love it as much as he does.  I had to go out and buy the CD for him and stick it on my iPod as well so we could listen to the songs in the car.  There's also a great 20 minute featurette about how the concert tour was created and performed, which is cool for the older viewers.  I hate to say it, but The Wiggles might just be vying for my fave group of all time, over The Velvet Underground.  Their songs sink in instantly, and this video is nothing but great fun.",1144972800,,1048,4.143564356435643
2165485,5,B00064AF96,"This DVD is the most engaging video the Wiggles have made, and we love it at our house.  It is a video of one of their live concerts in Sydney, Australia---their hometown, and it is an excellent sampling of their music and entertainment.  I have taken my two-yr-old daughter to two Wiggles concerts in the past year, and this is the closest you can get to being there without actually going!  Because we are such big Wiggles fans, and because the grandparents are so generous, we have every Wiggles video, and if I had to recommend just ONE for someone to buy, this one would be the one.  They start the show in the Big Red Car, entering the concert.  Every Wiggles fan alive knows ""Toot, Toot, Chugga, Chugga"", and every fan in the audience is cheering and singing along.  Throughout the video, the song and dance numbers are fun, catchy and memorable, and the Wiggles look like they are truly enjoying entertaining the children of the world.  Fun, exciting renditions of ""Rock-a-Bye Your Bear"", ""Hoop Dee Doo"" (great fun!), and a wonderful medley at the end help make this their greatest release yet.  There are great antics offered by each member of the Wiggles (Jeff falls asleep repeatedly, Anthony ""musically"" dances, Murray plays his guitar, etc.), and even Jolly Old St. Nick makes an appearance....after getting lost on his way to the concert!  It's always Christmas in Wiggles land, according to my daughter, so Santa is welcome anytime!  There are ""live"" satellite feeds from different parts of the world (including one from a fire station in New York!).  And as always, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy the Dinosaur and Wags the Dog add even more fun and humor to the show.  Don't forget the Wiggly dancers....all the favorites are there!  Kids love this video, and it is remarkably entertaining....not a dull moment. Want your kid to see a Wiggles concert, but they don't come to your hometown?  Buy this video.  It's almost like being there!  My daughter never tires of watching it, and Mommy likes it too!",1142985600,,2017,4.786127167630058
2165486,5,B00064AF96,"My daughter (who's 2), received this DVD, last year before she turned 2.  She enjoys watching the Wiggles on the Disney Channel.  We have numerous DVDs of the Wiggles and this is our favorite.  Entertaining and just plain fun.  My daughter will join the Wiggles on all the songs (not so much singing, but hand gestures).  She loves Rock-a-bye-bear!  Gets on the floor to roll like Captain Feathersword and running back.  Dorothy is our favorite in our house (popular name i.e. Elmo's fish's name is Dorothy). If your child is into the Wiggles this DVD is a must.  Great exercise music for us parents.  Plus the songs are not corny and are very entertaining. We love the Wiggles!!",1141689600,,679,4.686440677966102

2165488,4,B00064AF96,"You'll love this video!  Even though I've only been to two concerts, I felt a little cheapened watching this because it kind of slaps you in the face with how canned the whole Wiggles concert experience is.  We got this for my son's 3rd Christmas, and he has happily watched it a few times.  It's a great way to relive the concert experience!  The feature with King Mondo doing ""Eagle Rock"" is good, too.",1135036800,3,404,4.418918918918919

I purchased this dvd 2 weeks ago but do not plan on giving it to my children until christmas. After reading the reviews I am very pleased that I bought it. If it is anything like their tv shows Im sure my children will love it. This show is a joy to watch even for myself. These guys are very entertaining. For once it is nice to be able to enjoy a show as much as your children. Thanks to all of you who took the time out to write your reviews.

My now 2 1/2 year old nephew loves them so and nothing makes him happier, peppier or soothes him more than The Wiggles. When we adopted our 6 year old daughter from China last year, she quickly became a fan as well. The entire family knows every word to every song by heart! Come on, give in and try it. Won't hurt a bit and you might enjoy it! I guarantee that your pre-schooler to 8 year old will as well. Having seen the fellas in concert recently, this DVD is almost like ""being there""!

Such a creative group.  You really get a sense of how good their live shows are after seeing this.  We'll have to take Stephen before he is too old, or maybe the beauty of it is that Stephen will never be too old.

2165495,5,B00064AF96,"We got this DVD for our daughter for the 14+ hours car ride for vacation.  I wanted something cheap, long and that wouldn't drive us mad listening to but she would enjoy.  We got this at Wally World for $5.97 so it was cheap.  It's 140 mintues long so that was great becasue we hated having the change the others every 15-30 mintues!  She had a blast dancing and singing the whole time and I will admit it...so did my husband and I.  We would be cruising down the highway and before we knew it we would be singing Big Red Car or Hot Potato.  I know we couldn't believe it either but those are pretty catchy songs and it made our daughter giggle even harder when she realized we were singing too.  This quickly replaced all her toys, CD's and other DVD's as the favorite traveling companion.  Now that girl will ride around in the car all day long and it is just becasue of this DVD.",1126310400,,882,4.208333333333333
2165496,4,B00064AF96,"The Wiggles have produced some videos lately that were just horrendous -- ""Space Dancing,"" ""Top of the Tots,"" and ""Santa's Rocking.""  So, I checked this one out from my local video store instead of buying yet another disappointing DVD.

Well, I'm just going to have to go out and buy this one.  My child loved it, and I liked it, too.

It seems that one of my biggest problems with other recent Wiggles releases has been solved in this one.  All that endless mugging for the camera and forced smiling does not work well on the small screen.  However, on stage, the Wiggles seem perfectly natural, no matter how goofy they're being.  In fact, they shine on stage.

My other problem has been the abject hideousness of some of the new songs.  I had to ban ""Top of the Tots"" for awhile because the songs drove me nuts.  It wasn't the good kind of ""nuts"" that songs like ""Hot Potato"" drive you -- the kind where you are embarassed to find yourself happily singing the songs in the car even when your children aren't with you.  No, it's the kind of ""nuts"" that comes with having to listen to pop music all day.  The newer songs are bland, too complex for little ones, and don't naturally lend themselves to handmotions and dance steps that little ones can easily duplicate.

Well, that problem isn't completely resolved.  Some of the more useless new songs, like ""Central Park, New York,"" appear on this video.  (Note: The Aussie and American pronunciations of the word ""squirrel"" are so different as to cause confusion.)  However, some of the old favorites are there, too, so it's a pretty good balance.  My toddler doesn't mind.  She even loves ""Eagle Rock,"" which drives me screaming from the room every time.

The thing that really knocks this DVD down a star level for me is the appearance of Santa Claus.  It gives the video too much of a seasonal feel that just isn't helpful -- especially when it's 95 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 percent humidity, which it is two months out of the year here in Kentucky, USA.

Overall, this is one of the better Wiggles videos.  If your kids are fans, you need to get this one.",1124755200,3,2111,4.529100529100529
2165497,5,B00064AF96,Thank goodness for this dvd. I have a 21 month old granddaughter and this dvd is the only way to get her to bed at night.

2165508,5,B00064AF96,"The Wiggles have done it again, they made Live Hot Potatoes a huge sucess.  Each different song was so wonderful I, had to keep on singing along and not stop until-it was finished.

It was fun to see Captain Feathersword fly like an eagle while the Wiggles were performing ""Eagle Rock"".  I also liked ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"", ""I Wave My Arms and Swing my Baton"", and ""Play Your Guitar with Murray"".

I got this for my 4 yr old who really likes the Wiggles...I really like them too...she watches the show and I have a couple of tapes of them....following the reviews on here,  I ordered this DVD.....the first time I put it on , it did not hold her attention for more then a minute - no exaggeration....and this is a child you loves Kipper and Angelina Ballerina so it is not like she needs a big deal to keep her attention...but I know the problem...the problem is not the Wiggles but it is the format.....It is a LIVE in concert DVD and my daughter atleast is not really ""into""  watching a  full live recorded concert.....when they have songs in concert on Disney channel (ONE song) she loves it ...usually the songs are very upbeat and close up... but a whole DVD of a taped concert...eh....with far away shots and stuff like that

....

Fact is, later another time I put it on again and she did watch it....But it is not a DVD she has asked for ever again which is saying something.... Yesterday someone loaned us a Calliou tape and she wanted to see it so many times I had to say ""I think we need a rest!""

It must be very cool though to go to an actual concert of them...I love those guys! I am glad to see some kids really liked this DVD! I wish my daughter had cuz it cost $13!!! : )",1120089600,8,1377,4.154135338345864

All this aside, this video is fantastic. It was the ONLY thing that made our 16 hour car trip bearable. My daughter is so enamored of the Wiggles - she shrieks at the mere suggestion that I put it in the player. You will love this production, as it includes dozens of songs that are catchy, well-performed, and action-packed. At 18 months, Emma has learned most of the actions to most of the songs, and is especially fond of Rock-A-Bye-Bear. A list of some of the songs covered follows - I don't have the official list handy, but here's what I can remember:

Toot Toot

Rock-A-Bye-Bear

Hoop De Doo

D-O-R-O-T-H-Y the Dinosaur

Rolling Down the Sandhills

My 17-month-old son and neighbor's 2-year-old daughter are intensely frightened and burst into tears.  We've had the video for months and my son knows when the balloon is coming, immediately getting scared and teary-eyed.  I've never seen my son so sad and frightened.  My recommendation is that if you wish to buy this video/DVD, consider fast-forwarding around this performance.",1115769600,2,514,5.3875

2165516,5,B00064AF96,"This is a great DVD of The Wiggles in concert!  My 17 month old daughter loves to dance along when we play this DVD.  If your child loves The Wiggles for their songs, this is the DVD for you!  A bonus for the parents is the behind-the-scenes footage.  My husband and I found it very interesting to see all the work that goes into putting on a Wiggles concert.  Highly recommended DVD!",1112572800,2,384,4.277777777777778
2165517,5,B00064AF96,"I bought this video after seeing a positive review of it in a parents magazine.  You can only watch Barney so much.  My daughter doesn't watch the TV show, so doesn't know the characters or anything, but she loves this video and will watch it everyday.  There is lots of action and dancing that will keep both of us moving.  I had lukewarm feelings for some of the songs, like Central Park, but they have grown on me.  I would receommend this video.",1111363200,2,449,4.36144578313253
