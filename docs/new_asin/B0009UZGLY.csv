2323598,5,B0009UZGLY,Not what you would expect from a movie based on WWII history.  This movie should be shown in junior high schools.,1369008000,,113,4.380952380952381
2323599,5,B0009UZGLY,"Haven, based on Ruth Gruber's book does a suburb job of telling of the efforts of this remarkable woman in bringing some 900+ survivors to the United States. What makes this all the more important is that it deals with her efforts to help in the survivors' adjustments to Oswego New York- in particular with the local population. The cast does a supurb job in portraying the major figures involved in this story. I have waited some time for this movie made for television to actually come out on DVD. The wait was well worth it!",1338076800,6,528,4.510416666666667
2323600,4,B0009UZGLY,"Like was noted in another review, this is indeed a somewhat liberal adaptation of Ruth Gruber's book of the same name. It gets some things wrong (the lover in Berlin is never mentioned in her book, plus in reality some of the refugees were Christians), but it gets many things right. It certainly does capture the red tape and politics involved in saving these few when the US could certainly have saved many more, the suspicions of the Americans on the SS Henry Gibbons and in Oswego, the suffering the refugees had to endure in Europe. Guber's experiences clearly forced her to examine more fully what it meant for her to be a Jew, and it changed her life. But what really makes this worth watching are the performances by an absolutely terrific cast, some of whom are no longer with us. Richardson is terrific, and I only hope that Guber, who seems to be an absolute pistol well into her 90s, was satisfied by the portrayal.",1297987200,16,927,4.5568862275449105
2323601,5,B0009UZGLY,"an incredible story about a very brave young woman who is one of the many ""footnotes"" in history whose story has come to light.  I had the delightful experience of meeting  the real ""star"" at the  young age of 90 plus.  Talk about spunky. Harry Truman had to love this lady.  A movie worth watching-  make sure you order the correct ""Haven""-  now I have two.  Definitely a  ""must see""---------",1259712000,6,393,4.5
2323602,1,B0009UZGLY,The movie is not historically accurate and feels like  some kind of one-sided propaganda. It seems like the story is really told from a Jewish perspective. The story of the people is sad but the theme is the same and the plot of the story is actually a bit tedious to handle for too long.,1234483200,2,288,4.236363636363636
2323603,5,B0009UZGLY,Excellently done!  We have no idea what so many people went through as they sought to live to the end of WWII.,1198454400,10,110,4.0
2323604,4,B0009UZGLY,"This film is a somewhat idealized and liberally adapted dramatization of a WWII event that was sadly unique: The transportation in 1944 of 892 Jewish refugees from the Holocaust to the United States -- the only ones allowed on U.S. soil throughout the War. They were sheltered at Fort Ontario, Oswego, NY for the rest of the war. Eventually, they were allowed to immigrate under the various immigration quotas. I happen to be one of the lucky individuals in that shipment. And although I can say that the story is less than 100 percent accurate, the film is very successful in its presentation and impact.

Starring as Ruth Gruber, the overseer of the project, is Natasha Richardson, delivering her lines in an amazingly authentic Brooklyn accent characteristic of Gruber, no small achievement for an English actress. Anne Bancroft and Martin Landau play her parents and William Petersen and Hal Holbrook play US congressmen.

The 3-hour-plus film is loaded with drama and tension and holds together very admirably. Most notably, the film gives the viewer an intriguing snapshot of America in the midst of the war and the attitudes of her people toward refugees. I might add that it also gives an equally graphic picture of the refugees' impressions of America and Americans.",1140739200,58,1275,5.009433962264151
2323628,5,B0009UZGLY,One of the best War Time movies that I've ever had the privilege to watch. Period. This is such a touching film. It's a keeper!,1512259200,,127,4.12
2323629,5,B0009UZGLY,"This is a story that needs to be told. I didn't know about this historical event.  Yes, it is told from the Jewish viewpoint as it is their story. It was long...3hrs and you could tell it was a made-for-TV movie as there were long breaks.  I loved the 1940's clothes, cars and other WWII props.  I did think it was strange that main character Ruth worn a white suit for travel...and in a military transport plane.  More than once, I asked ""why is she wearing that"".  I liked the flashback scenes done in black and white film with the main story in color...that helps when there are lots of flashbacks. The makeup on Ruth's love interest was strange as he appeared to be wearing dark lipstick in some of the scenes. The acting was fair at times.  I found it odd that some of the actors put their hand over their hearts while singing ""God Bless America""; that isn't  required as it is not the national anthem.  I am glad I watched it.",1511913600,,932,4.316091954022989

2323632,4,B0009UZGLY,"Summer 1942 a German industrialist visiting Switzerland reported that the Nazis were murdering Jews.
The report was cabled to the US State Dept.  but the cable was suppressed. Soon after came another
cable, cable 482. It revealed a Nazi plan called  Vernichtung (annihilation). Total annihilation of Europes
Jews. (ARLEN LLOYD) This cable was also suppressed. Back in the 30's before the war the State Dept.
advised all US embassies in Europe to delay and effectively prevent Jews from obtaining visas. By 1941
Jewish immigration to the US was virtually shut down.
The World Jewish Congress raised money to bribe foreign officials to get the Jews out of Nazi hands.
Treasury approved a currency license within 24 hours. But the State Dept sat on it. Thousands of Jewish
lives could have been saved. Treasury dept wrote a report entitled ""The Acquiescence of this Government
in the Murder of the Jews"". But again that report was never made public. The reason, no one wants the Jews.",1510963200,3,981,4.975609756097561

2323652,5,B0009UZGLY,"Watching this film was deeply upsetting to me.  I knew a little about our history of not admitting Jews during WWII.  I had no idea the extent of this tragedy.  The telling fact (I assume it is factual) is that less than 1000 Jews were sheltered in this country during WWII.  Yet we admitted 400,000 German prisoners of war.  Appalling! We need to be ashamed of this.  This is a must see film for students of the Holocaust and US history.",1407542400,,438,4.345679012345679

2323655,5,B0009UZGLY,This is a wonderful movie that tugs at your heart strings for what these people went through. It just goes to show you how much 1 person can make a difference even with the odds against her. It definately is worth buying and watching.,1388448000,,234,4.340909090909091
2323656,4,B0009UZGLY,"Having read the book, I wanted to see the movie.  As everyone says, you
need to read the book first!  I know the location in Oswego, New York.
There could have been more footage shot at Fort Oswego and Lake Ontario.
They mention the bridge over the Oswego River and a long shot from there
would have been very nice!
Overall, I liked it the movie...more for the actors than for the story.  Make
some popcorn, sit back and start the movie!",1386028800,2,437,4.304878048780488
2323657,5,B0009UZGLY,"Official US policy just prior to WW-II was unfriendly toward Jews.  This movie presents the story of just one group who did receive asylum (1944!) as they are selected to come to America, taken to an Army base in upstate New York, and become adjusted to their new surroundings.  The neighbors adjust also.  In turns, heart-warming, frustrating, and ultimately happy.",1371686400,4,366,5.066666666666666
8067152,5,B0009UZGLY,"Excellent movie! It opened my eyes on how passive American government was on helping Jews during WW 2. How bureaucratic and unsympathetic it was!! America is consisted of immigrants who came here fleeing from religious persecution, hunger and suffering. Turning blind eye on suffering
 of Jews from hands of Nazi regime is just unforgivable!",1525737600,,341,5.314814814814815
8067153,2,B0009UZGLY,"This is a story worth telling but it's worth telling well. Instead of sticking to the main story of Jewish refugees brought to America in 1944, the film goes back and forth between romances and family problems. It's like this film is trying to be a mini version of Schindler's List. Natasha Richardson's acting is wooden and her attempt at a Brooklyn accent sounds like a bad imitation of a 1930's gangster moll. There is no doubt, that politics in the USA kept thousands of Jews from immigrating and cost countless lives. It's a shameful part of history that deserves better treatment.",1519084800,,586,4.754901960784314
8067154,5,B0009UZGLY,"Excellent.  Loved the history, acting, and story.  It's a good one to watch 2 nights, breaking at the arrival to the U.S.",1515715200,,121,4.454545454545454

8067157,5,B0009UZGLY,"Excellent film because it awakens the goodness in all of us. I found I was asking myself how would I have done in each of their shoes. We fear and resist changes and unfamiliarity that we do not perceive to be in our favor. This film showed me that some of those who seemed indifferent and cruel not because they were cruel, but simply were lacking the knowledge and understanding of people who were different. I love the part where the ""entertainer"" from Berlin prevented an ugly fight on the ship through humorous singing and acting. Remember, laughter may be the best medicine in healing some of our most stubborn wounds.",1513900800,,624,4.63063063063063

8067160,2,B0009UZGLY,"Stirring true stories, magnificent actors; what could be wrong?

While the subject is extremely touching and heart-wrenching, the film is not.  The makers seem to have been more concerned with sex-based story lines, abrupt camera close-ups (post Blair Witch Project casualty), equally abrupt music and loudness levels, and acquiring brilliant actors instead of preparing them for their parts (namely, convincing accents & tears) or having a well-written script.

It came off as contrived, even over-the-top in places; more like a Lifetime movie.  The sudden zooming in to crying faces & blaring violins as the actors were telling the REAL stories of these people was unnecessary & off-putting.  It felt like the director was opposed to silence, failing to allow the audience to reflect on or even comprehend the weight of what was at stake.

This is one of those movies that should have been governed by the ""less-is-more"" rule, letting the story tell itself.  It could have been so moving...  Many missed opportunities...

I would recommend watching from the last 9 1/2 minutes, only for the actual footage of this tragedy & explanation of what the 989 refugees in the U.S. faced after their rescue, & the outcome.",1513296000,,1215,5.095959595959596
