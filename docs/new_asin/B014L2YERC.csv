8731243,5,B014L2YERC,"several street gangs known as the Tokyo tribes are all pitted up against each other and it's all set to a heavy hip hop beat. the perfect combination of hip hop music and nonstop action, the music is great and the fight scenes are fun to watch (the 14 minute royal rumble with ALL the tribes fighting is one of the most adrenaline pumping fight scenes I've watched in a long time). I wasn't even expecting this to be part musical honestly so that took me by surprise lol, and I didn't realize it was a manga adaptation either but now I'm considering checking out the source material :). anyway, make some popcorn, turn it on, and have a good time",1474416000,,646,4.347107438016529

8731247,4,B014L2YERC,"ts one thing to see a movie like Tokyo Tribe and another completely to express what the movie is and how it is to people who may not get the movies that come to Fantastic Fest. I don't say that to come off as superior or belittle any of you fine Reelers out there that have never been to the festival or seen releases from it, but rather to express my difficulties here. Its the newest movie by director Sion Sono who is one of the favorite sons of Fantastic Fest and also something of a madman with his gorgeously stylized and zany movies. His movie last year, Why Dont You Play in Hell was one of mine, and most other festival goers favorites so I was certainly excited for this one. So now I get the joy of trying to explain this movie to you.

The film itself is based on a popular serialized Manga of the same name and really takes off from there. It is the story of all of the titular Tokyo Tribes, or the gangs that control different regions of Tokyo, and how things go down on one particular night. This night is special though as an ambitious outsider, Sunmi (Nana Seino) arrives with the goal of cleaning up this city, but quickly falling victim to one of the lecherous gang leaders, Mera (Ryuhei Suzuki) and the most despicable crime lord in the city, Buppa (Riki Takeuchi). With the help of the young Yon (Kikoto Sakaguchi) she must escape and warn the tribes that Buppa plans to take them out in an all out war. They get some aid from Kai (Young Dais) and Tera (Ryuta Soto) of the only gang promoting peace in the city, but it will take more than just this small band to stop Buppas evil plot.

Yes, that really does sound like a comic book plot as the story originally is, but that doesnt even cover the best part: Its a rap musical! You read that right, Sono collected a group of rappers and break dancers to give the move a really credible musical sound as all of the actors on screen are highly skilled with their music. Each different gang and region are a different style of rap and dance and represent their musical preference well and breath great life into the film through it. Few to none of the actors on screen have any prior acting experience in a very bold choice, but it pays off because the focus on the music helps prevent the comic book feel from being lost in an attempt to be too real or serious in a performance.

The performances overall are really good too, with no one taking the subject matter too seriously to hurt that energy. Seino is arguably our main character and brings quite a bit of warmth to the role, whether it be from a friendly air or a moment of serialization with a purpose, and she also kills it in the action as well. Sakaguchi is the youngest member of the cast but he doesnt let that stop him either as he does some of the most to move the story and see the day, even if he says very little, because hes always moving and generally kicking ass. Dais and Soto are fine, but mostly best together rather than apart as they are supposed to be the best of friends showing the benefits of peace and happiness, though they fight well when needed. Suzuki really stands out as Mera as he is quite a bit crazed at times with his commitment to hating Kai and his friends for an (until the conclusion) unknown reason, but he adds a lot of the comedy and brings about some of the best fight scenes. Takeuchi is basically the big buddy but also the biggest comic relief as he is like a more mobile Jabba the Hut but to comical extremes as he hedonistically devours flesh and constantly thinks about sex. No one truly stands out with a best performance or any to truly write home about as far as emotional and powerful perfromances. However, they all do a great job in their roles and especially with their rapping and some of the fighting really.

Sono has always been something of a mad genius and that has never been more apparent than in this move. The absurdity and excess are all played the give this world true life and give more believability to these gangs existing, these characters constantly rapping, and this crazy culture that is allowed to persist. The movie is bright and vibrant despite featuring lots of death, depravity, poverty and pain in a way Sono can always bring to the screen and it is just wonderful. The biggest issues though also fall on Sono as some ideas feel less fleshed out and underexecuted and sometimes the pace is slowed too much after the energy of a hilarious rap/murder/dinner at Buppas. There needs to be slower moments in any movie, but sometimes its left to drag too much and really felt like the time couldve been used better. As for underexecuted, Ill just say that there is a scene with a tank and how that is done and what is done with it underwhelmed me and actually left me guessing why it was in there at all. These are little things in an otherwise truly enjoyable movie with great comedy, action and music, but it needs to be mentioned.",1453939200,2,4932,4.357608695652174

8731250,4,B014L2YERC,"As the back of the box reads: In a futuristic Japan, territorial street gangs form opposing factions collectively known as the Tokyo Tribes. When one of the gang leaders breaks the fragile peace, it triggers a brutal street war for supremacy. From acclaimed director Sion Sono (Why don't you play in hell?) Based on  a popular Manga series, Tokyo Tribe is an ingenious mash-up of yakuza gang violence, martial arts and hip-hop musical.

I didn't know what to expect going into Tokyo Tribe. Watching a trailer, it looked like it would be a fun, over-the-top low-budget extreme-violence movie (along the lines of Machine Girl or Tokyo Gore Police). It wasn't quite that.. but I don't really know what it was.

The movie clocks in at just under 2 hours and a lot of it seems to be weird just for the sake of being weird. These movies tend to work better in shorter bursts, but I had no problem sitting through the entire thing.  I will say that THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I imagine most will find difficulty enjoying it (or even watching the entire thing) so I suggest at least watching a trailer for it.. and even then, the movie isn't quite what it seems.

If I had to compare it to something, I'd probably say Jet Set Radio meets Volcano High meets Machine Girl meets MTV.

One of the big things that sets it apart from the low-budget ultra-gore titles are that it's so much bigger. While most of those seem to be on a 10-person-cast, 1,000 budget and shot in 6 days, this one seems to have a 200-person-cast, a million dollar budget and shot in 6 months. Everything from the acting (if you want to call it that) to the location, the props, the set-design, outfits, lighting and filming.. it's all on a much higher level.
With that said, it's just as weird.. and sometimes a little too weird.

The movie features hip hop music throughout -- not as a background track, but as the different gangs rapping throughout, making it some sort of hip hop extreme rap battle thing. I can dig that! Unfortunately, I found much of the rapping to be a bit too bland and in some cases cringe-worthy, with only a few pieces standing out. When it's such a big part of the film, it's a bit of a letdown and I couldn't tell if they were trying to be serious with it or if it was just another oddity of the movie. In some spots, you can see where they were wanting to go with it, but it just never reached that level.

The movie is all over the place and pretty fast-paced, cutting from scene to scene and the different gangs throughout -- this is where I find a lot of people will be turned off by it -- but what was so interesting was just how packed the sets were. Dozens of extras in each area, setting off fireworks, using lazers, driving in tanks, LED lights everywhere, neon street signs covering the place, graffiti all over the walls and trashcans on fire. They definitely filled out the sets to make it an interesting ""experience"".

I found that I didn't really care about any of the characters in the movie - maybe it was the constant cutting between them, I'm not sure. There wasn't much character building and in a 2-hour movie about all the gangs fighting eachother, you should have someone to root for! Some characters got a lot more screentime than others (and I can't say this is a bad thing -- some of the characters were just so cringe-worthy, I was happy to not have to see them as much).

After watching it, I don't really know what happened. But I liked it. It wasn't great, it was definitely memorable and I definitely want to watch it again just to see all the stuff I missed the first time. It was a fun movie -- maybe a bit long, but it stayed interesting throughout. With that said, I have a hard time recommending it since I can see most people just absolutely hating it. If you liked some of the other things I compared it to (Volcano High, Jet Set Radio, Machine Girl) you might enjoy this. If you're looking for a serious movie, or aren't familiar with those other titles mentioned, look elsewhere!

The Blu-Ray has Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English Subtitles. The only extra included is a Theatrical Trailer. I think for a movie this odd, there must be tons of weird extras out there and I wish they had included some behind the scenes footage on here.",1450137600,5,4281,4.426937738246505
