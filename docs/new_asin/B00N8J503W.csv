8676570,5,B00N8J503W,"Teen Dominique is the opposite of her perfect older sister. She fails in school, is rebellious, fights with her parents, and is promiscuous. She succeeds, however, in mesmerizing her sisters boyfriend. And then theres a murder. This film goes back and forth between courtroom drama and flashbacks of action leading up to the murder. This is a fascinating movie that is engrossing from beginning to end. High drama, lots of action, and suspense. Bardot is at her best. Her acting is mostly outstanding punctuated with a few weak moments. But Bardot and the film itself are classic. If you see only one Bardot film, I would recommend this one. It is must see viewing.",1494028800,,665,4.842105263157895
