5683264,5,B00BZZMXMW,"Gabriel and Legion were my favorite, but all three are really good films that have I feel a high degree of truth to them. Legion is wonderful because it shows the love that the Angels have for us and warns that Angels commanded by the Heavenly Father can demolish rebelious children if we go beyond the point of no return. Gabriel is amazing because it shows how we come to this plane with a powerful sense of purpose but we forget about it, get discouraged or become compromised if we don't hold tightly on the Alliance with our Creator. Highly recommended to everyone no matter your background.",1465948800,2,596,4.579439252336448
5683265,5,B00BZZMXMW,"LOVED PRIEST when I saw it and wanted to buy it eventually.  Well, when I saw Gabriel and Legion with it, which I had never seen, and at a GREAT PRICE, had to get it.

PRIEST is my favorite, although I enjoyed LEGION and GABRIEL very much (Andy was GREAT in the lead of Gabriel, may he rest in peace).",1465603200,2,301,4.0

5683299,5,B00BZZMXMW,"I have been watching ""Dominion"".on SyFy and I really like the series, it says its based on the movie ""Legion"", so I bought ""Legion"" its a very good movie, I enjoyed watching it, the movie ""Priest"" is also very good, the movie ""Gabriel"" is ok but it does look low budget, but you get three movies for the price of one so its a very good deal.",1407542400,17,341,4.104477611940299
5683300,5,B00BZZMXMW,legion and priest are great but gabriel is just a litte lame so far of what ive seen (ive watched only a part of it and the story line sucked but altogether it was worth the money,1406678400,3,179,3.864864864864865

5683304,3,B00BZZMXMW,"Expected a better plot. I felt that I was not sure of what was suppose to be going on in the story.
The character development was disconnected. I couldn't tell if  Gabriel was the avenger, a God send or

8575990,4,B00BZZMXMW,If you enjoy the genre then Gabriel and Legion are worth the trip... Priest on the other hand tries TOO hard and mostly comes up short... but still worth the watch for the action... plus you can't beat the price for a disc version.,1513468800,,231,4.2727272727272725

8575992,4,B00BZZMXMW,"Actually, this trifecta is a good deal.  Scott Stewart is a filmaker to watch.  I loved both LEGION & PRIEST while Gabriel was just simply boring.  If you have 10$ or less...go for it.  3 films at that price are a bargain.  Enjoy, 4 stars is a good n fair rating.",1511740800,,263,4.078431372549019
