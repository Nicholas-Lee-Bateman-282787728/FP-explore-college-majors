1826353,5,B00008438W,"This film is very old....but that's what makes it great.  It's interesting to see the old computer equipment the newspaper used, and the old Amtrak trains throughout the finale.  I also like it because John Belushi was a comedian attempting to make that cross-over to drama (of course this isn't a stone cold drama like ""Out of Africa"" for instance).  Many comedians have failed in this...like Chevy Chase in ""Foul Play"" and John Candy in ""Only the Lonely"" and Richard Pryor in ""Which Way is Up?"".  I think Belushi pulled it off beautifully.  It's also the type of movie that leaves you with your heart exposed...it leaves you with a sense of longing deep in your soul....as Belushi rides off in the final scene you can't help but think of how the story goes on from there.  You can't help but think that you want to be there, you want to feel like they feel as they proceed into the unknown area of post-credithood.",971913600,16,916,4.554878048780488
1826354,5,B00008438W,"what's all this about no great ending? if you've ever had a situation where two people love each other but HAD to go seperate ways, to live different lives, this is the film for you.
along with ""a touch of  class"" and ""same time next year"" this is in my triumverate  of romantic films.
perfectly, if somewhat surprisingly, cast, especially  john, whose weight goes up and down in the film (suspension of disbelief,  please), the movie is fun, funny, and sweet. it works, and that's my  highest praise.",950054400,2,501,4.6477272727272725
1826382,5,B00008438W,"I did not realize until this year that this is my favorite movie. Everyone talks about the famous John Belushi. But it is Blair Brown who carries this movie. ""The young female is dominant,"" she says, describing American Bald Eagles. Blair Brown's character chooses to live her life using nature's rules, which she has observed as an ornithologist living in the Rocky Mountains. She says no to sex with Belushi's character until she is ready to say yes.  She will not be pressured into going against her own judgement. And she will not play second fiddle to Belushi - not because of an inflated sense of self but because she has chosen work that is important to her. This poor couple love each other but cannot give up their careers to be together. He is a prize-winning journalist in Chicago. She is an ornithologist trying to stop the extinction of  the American Bald Eagle. They cannot be together without losing a vital piece of themselves. As she says, while giving a lecture on bald eagles in Chicago, ""They soar alone. That is the only way they can fly"".  I loved this 1981 movie then and I love it now. Way to go, Lady.",1500336000,,1126,4.536945812807882
1826383,2,B00008438W,"I heard about the movie years ago, where it was John Belushi playing against type. I finally saw it in the library and picked it up for evening entertainment. Good thing I didn't pay for it.

Belushi plays a very popular reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times who prints plenty of embarrassing stories about a Chicago alderman, with the result that he gets beaten up and put into a hospital. His boss comes to him and has him travel to the Rocky Mountains on assignment to try to interview a reclusive female eagle researcher. He is unhappy to go there, but has no choice, and after quite a bit of mountain climbing, he reaches her cabin.

There are some mild laughs, and the idea could perhaps have been good, but everyone seems to be going through the motions, and the movie ends up feeling lifeless and dull. Not only Belushi but everybody else seems out of place here,",1497052800,,868,4.522292993630574

1826385,5,B00008438W,I must say that this movie is a must have for reasons you wouldn't think. The great John belushi is actually quite char and believable in the role of reporter and love interest. People undervalued his acting skills which you can understand since his comic touch was gold. Nice love story overall with some nice views of Chicago. Can't go wrong with this one,1494201600,,357,4.59375
1826386,5,B00008438W,"A wonderful romantic comedy with one of John Belushi's very best performances.

1826448,5,B00008438W,"This is an unlikely John Belushi film, but like Bill Murray's THE RAZOR'S EDGE, completed around the same time, it was meant to show that the SNL alum had some real acting chops. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE was meant to be the first in a series of John Belushi / Blair Brown romantic comedies, but Belushi's tragic death by overdose six months after the film's release put paid to that idea, and to Brown's career as a leading lady, sadly.

That being said, CONTINENTAL DIVIDE is a gem. Belushi plays Ernie Souchak, an investigative reporter in Chicago whose muckraking pieces about municipal corruption get him put on a hit list. To save his life, his editor sends him out of town to the unlikeliest of destinations, the Wyoming Rockies, where he is tasked with interviewing the reclusive Dr. Nell Porter (Blair Brown), an ornithologist specializing in the American Bald Eagle.

Souchak, the chain-smoking, booze-guzzling, porkpie hat-wearing, overweight city boy whose world is centered on State Street, doesn't want to go, and the mere act of climbing up to Porter's lonely eyrie almost does him in. Porter doesn't want him there, especially since he's unannounced, and for awhile tries to send him back down the mountain alone. ""I'll die,"" he complains. ""Life is full of little trade-offs,"" she counters.

Eventually he wins her over with his grandmother's goulash and with his clumsy attempts at helping around the house. Eventually, she begins taking him along on her daily observation climbs. Love, inevitably, grows, and when he returns to Chicago he is comically lost in bliss, which ends when his informant is killed. He begins writing his trademark slash-and-burn pieces again, almost forgetting about Nell until she appears in Chicago on a lecture tour. Their relationship is rekindled, and they find a way to make it work despite the fact that he remains in the city and she in the mountains. And they live happily ever after.

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, produced by Steven Speilberg and written by Lawrence Kasdan, was the first film made under the Amblin Entertainment rubric, and it has snappy dialogue, excellent characterizations, a comfortable chemistry between the leads, and a positive American message reminiscent of the great celebratory work of Frank Capra, not to mention spectacular location shooting in the High Rockies. It's a pleasure to watch, if a little winsome; who knows what else Belushi and Brown could have created as they got to know one another better?",1471910400,,2475,5.073710073710074
1826449,5,B00008438W,John Belushi in a love story and losing weight too!  Blair Brown manages to be simultaneously tough as nails and cute as kittens.  IMDB rates it at 6.1 but I think it deserves higher.,1471737600,,183,4.352941176470588
1826450,4,B00008438W,"A really wonderful romantic comedy with an unusual male lead. But it actually works. Blair Brown as a charming ""Eagle Freak is also a welcome sight.

The Times sends Belushi off, to lay low, for an uneventful report on an eagle expert in Colorado's Continental Divide.  Here's where the romantic lead comes in.  Belushi finds the eagle expert not as dry and boring as he first imagined, trying to overcome her dislike of him as an intruder in her private life.

Unfortunately, he gets in a little too deep after an investigative column exposes one of the city's aldermans. He is requested by his editor to take a little break from Chicago and concentrate on 'fluff' material for the paper. His assignment is to write an article about naturalist Nell Porter, a woman living in the Rockies studying the bald eagles and its vanishing habitat.

  I remember this movie from the early 1980s and I love the chemistry between Belushi and Brown. I think it's also because of the repoire the stars have with each other that makes it unique.

However, as the sparks begin to fly, Belushi returns back to Chicago and after assuring his editor that he is completely over her, she arrives in Chicago to give lectures about eagles and soon rekindles their passion. But the two are left with a tough decision: They both love their work and surroundings and find the other one's surroundings difficult to live in. So what can they do?

The language is mild and the violence is mild too. After all, Belushi plays a city boy who must fall down a few times in the mountains and even has to be attacked by a mountain lion. The footage of the mountains is breaktaking and certainly worth the watch. And unlike many love stories where two people are forced together against their wills, this love story seems completely believable because they gain each other's respect first before falling in love.",1336780800,,1270,4.669642857142857

1826871,4,B00008438W,"CONTINENTAL DIVIDE is a sweet, predictable romantic comedy of two opposites who in classic movie fashion can't stand each other at first but then fall madly in love.  Although this is a comedy there is also lots of drama and John Belushi's portrayal of Ernie, an intelligent Chicago investigative reporter, is far from his role as ANIMAL HOUSE'S Bluto or most of his other characters in SNL sketches.  Ernie needs to get out of town for awhile because his investigating has angered some powerful and corrupt politicians.  His editor suggests he hide out in Wyoming and get an interview with Nell, a woman who has been studying bald eagles at her remote mountain top home.  Ernie with his chubbiness and chain smoking is a typical fish out of water in this rugged terrain. He ends up staying at the cabin of the  beautiful self-reliant eagle expert Nell played by Blair Brown who is at first immune to Ernie's charms.  It will come as no surprise to frequent viewers of romantic comedies that after a series of misunderstandings and misadventures Nell and Ernie find they can't live without each other.  Of course there's a problem - her life is in Wyoming protecting and studying the eagles and his is in Chicago protecting the city from corruption.  Aside from the love story the movie offers some beautiful mountain scenery, shots of Chicago that make it look like a glamorous city and views of bald eagles who are thankfully not nearly as endangered as they were in 1981 when the movie was made.  Lots of other things from dress styles to office equipment have changed since the early 80's and the Chicago portion of the film stands as a window in to that time.",1203120000,11,1664,4.690721649484536

Light romantic comedy is one way to pigeonhole this movie but there is more to it than meets the eye and ear.  Firstly, the cinematography of the Rocky Mountains and the American Bald Eagles is worth the price of admission.  There is some wonderful footage as well of Chicago.  This is a LAWRENCE KASDAN film and he is a master of filming BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN URBAN ARCHITECTURE like Los Angeles in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Canyon/dp/B000056BSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Canyon</a>

Both KASDAN movies, ""Continental Divide"" and ""Grand Canyon"" feature some great cinematography contrasting the urban with the sublime wilderness.  TRITE?  Maybe, in 2008,  but very forwarding looking at the time it was written by Kasdan.

One reviewer here wrote that this movie is ""OLD""?  I got a kick out of that.  Believe me, there are many older movies!  Ha HA!

Maybe what she meant to say is that the movie isn't aging well and its characteristic of a time period.  That I would agree with.

Is it unlikely and unrealistic that Blair Brown could fall so hopelessly in love with John Belushi?  OF COURSE!  But, thats what the movies are all about folks!  Giving us Belushis of the world some hope! ;-)~

This movie is in my collection to stay.",1200873600,,1448,5.089743589743589
1826873,4,B00008438W,"Like my title blurb says, this is not a comedy with John Belushi, but rather a romantic drama with a few light comedic touches, so if you're looking for some Belushi laughs in the manner of ""The Blues Brothers"" or ""1941"" you'll be sorely disappointed. I'm not a Belushi expert by any means but from what I understand ""Continental Divide"" is one of his only serious roles, and he does it well. It's also one of his last films; a mere five & a half months after the theatrical release John foolishly passed away from drug abuse at the way-too-young age of 33 on March 5, 1982.

THE PLOT: Belushi plays Ernie Souchak, a popular Chicago columnist, whose controversial reporting lands him in the hospital. His boss, who wants to get him out of the city, sends him to the scenic Rocky Mountains to interview famous bald eagle researcher Nell Porter, played by the beautiful Blair Brown. Souchak is a city man who chain-smokes, whereas Nell revels in the wilderness and hates jounalists. Will they end up falling in love? And, if so, how can a marriage possibly work if they both insist on remaining in their vastly different worlds so far apart?

I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but I will occasional watch romantic dramas like ""Ode to Billy Joe,"" ""The Whole Wide World"" or even ""Love Story."" Although ""Continental Divide"" isn't nearly as serious as those films, it's not a comedy either. There are a few minor laughs, usually tied to Souchak's awkwardness in the wilderness, but that's about it. Although light-hearted, this is indeed a serious film. It's not only entertaining, it surprisingly has a few notable things to say.

The most prominent part of the film is the hour or so wherein Souchak goes to the Rockies and stays with Nell. Most men will likely become infatuated with Blair Brown as Souchak falls in love with Nell. I did. Blair was 35 years old at the time of filming (although she appears to be in her early 40s) and has a very earthy look; she never wears make-up and never reveals a lot of flesh. She doesn't need to. She has a strong, independant mindset and yet, at the same time, is very likable and alluring. Her body has the necessary natural roundishness and curves that attract red-blooded men.

I heard some reviewers complain about the sequence wherein Nell secretly meets a ultra-stud mountain man (an ex-football player) for a literal roll in the meadow. They argue that this is a meaningless and unneeded sequence. Actually the story is making a statement with this subplot (SPOILER -- if you wanna figure it out on your own don't read the rest of this paragraph): Although Nell would occasionally meet the ultra-macho stud as a sexual outlet in the lonely wilderness, it's obvious she doesn't love the dude in a romantic sense. Their relationship is superficial because it fulfills only one purpose and doesn't go any deeper. As the story progresses Nell falls in love with Souchak, a man who is the antithesis of the studly mountain man in every way. Souchak isn't macho-looking at all; he's only of average height and isn't in very good physical shape. He is, however, an intelligent and expert writer, amongst other things. The message we can glean from this is that men don't have to be ultra-masculine-looking to win the heart of a beautiful woman. And you know what? It's true. Just look around. This is an encouraging message for guys who aren't the ""tall, dark and handsome"" type.

The first two times I saw ""Continental Divide"" I felt it was poorly named. Much of the story takes place in the mountains near the Continental Divide, so what? The third time I watched it the title's meaning dawned on me (I know, I'm a doofus): Souchak and Nell's lives are divided by half a continent; how could a long-term relationship possibly work? The ending is surprising and unconventional, but it works. Very well, in fact.",1196035200,,3852,4.70074074074074

1826875,4,B00008438W,"This is the best John Belushi movie.  In fact, in a very real sense it is the **only** John Belushi movie.  It was the only film that ever gave John the chance to play a realistic, believable character whom the viewer could come to know and like, rather than some kind of grotesque caricature who might not even show his eyes to the movie camera.

Reviewers at the time who compared John's performance to Spencer Tracy or other classic Hollywood actors were rather missing the point.  This movie allowed John to be a romantic hero while remaining **John Belushi**.  For those of us who have perceived his sensitivity and sweetness in his other work (see, for example, the SNL ""Laundromat"" sketch with Gilda Radner), the result is convincing and moving.  Unfortunately, in 1981 the majority of Belushi fans appear to have been the kind of people who would rather go to a party with John Blutarsky than have dinner with Ernie Souchak.",1184803200,2,932,4.722222222222222
1826876,5,B00008438W,"I've always remembered this movie from when I was a kid and saw it on cable TV. Having seen it again, I think what really makes this film such a sweet and wonderful thing is how the main characters (played by John Belushi and Blair Brown) stay true to themselves as individuals even while falling in love. Without giving too much away here, it's very refreshing to have a romance film in which ""love"" has as much to do with mutual respect and deep caring for another human being as it does with good ol' reliable movie-screen passion. Ernie Souchak (Belushi) and Nell Porter (Brown) have what is considered a far-from-perfect predicament in the game of love, but the way in which they find a solution together makes for one of the sweetest love stories I've ever seen in a movie.

Of course, there's no way to watch this film without feeling the sadness and lament over Belushi's too-soon death at age 33. And yet, I think it's really remarkable to see Belushi ""the actor"" overcome some of the jokier elements in the film that I think were included only to appease Belushi fans who wanted yet another variation on Bluto from ANIMAL HOUSE or Capt. ""Wild Bill"" the crazed fighter pilot from Spielberg's 1941. In the end, his commitment to playing a character rather than a cartoon is to be praised and appreciated with a viewing of this special little film.

And this film would be the worst kind of insipid without the great actress Blair Brown bringing some very real dimension and humanity to the character of Nell Porter. Bringing undeniable intelligence and unbent courage to the role, her performance reminds viewers how much fun and challenge there is when you fall in love with somebody in real life.

One last thing -- I'm standing up here to praise the great character actor Allen Garfield (who changed his name back to Allen Goorwitz by the time he made this film). He plays Ernie Souchak's editor Howard (""a man with a newspaper to run,"" as he tells nearly everyone throughout the film), and his performance is note-perfect. A totally believable human being - Goorwitz lives up to the finest virtues a working actor can achieve. Kudos to him - I will always wish that he had done more films.

So if you would like to feel again that this is a pretty darn good planet filled with some pretty darn good people (some of whom want to save eagles), I strongly recommend that you see this movie. Enjoy!",1174521600,17,2406,4.601398601398602
1826877,5,B00008438W,"If you can't imagine John Belushi as a leading man, then somehow you have missed this jewel from 1981. Well, okay, he was no Cary Grant.  But he proved he didn't have to be in order to play hard-case muckraking Chicago columnist Ernie Souchak convincingly and with heart.

This film belongs to Belushi and to the irresistible Blair Brown as scientist/naturalist Nell Porter, who at first seems as remote as her mountain cabin. Of course both characters eventually thaw amid the snow of the spectacular Rockies as they discover their vulnerability and a love that refuses to be conquered by distance.

To their credit, the actors ovecome occasionally weak dialog and some inane sub-plots -- like the embarrassingly superfluous and confusing introduction of a pro-footballer-turned-mountain man who has been trysting with Porter -- to make us suspend our disbelief and care about them despite the script flaws.  Also deserving of a salute is the satisfying, rather un-Hollywood-like ending.

As the final credits roll and Helen Reddy sings, you'll probably be as captivated by Nell as Souchak was, and you might feel the urge to hit the streets of Chicago where it seems Belushi/Souchak should still be pounding the sidewalks. Then you may feel a tinge of sadness as you remember that his talent was taken from us much too soon.

As an aside, note that Steven Spielberg was an executive producer.",1162857600,5,1394,5.012987012987013
1826898,5,B00008438W,"John Belushi's characters have always had a bit of the maverick in them. Funny, or otherwise, they were definitely memorable, and Continental Divide is no exception. However, this time his maverick attitude shows an unexpected depth which plays well off Blair Brown's no nonsense character.  This is one of those rare movies where two strong talents actually complement each other without overpowering the story.  Continetal Divide is entertaining and educational without being mundane or preachy.  I still haven't decided which was best, the story or the scenery.",1140393600,3,564,5.459770114942529
1826899,5,B00008438W,"Continental Divide is part of the trilogy writing debut of Lawrence Kasdan.  Kasdan had three films released in 1981 for which he wrote the screenplay.  The most famous was the adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, followed by this romantic comedy, and finally the potboiler film noiresque Body Heat.

Continental Divide has been referred to as a modern Hepburn Tracey film.

John Belushi plays Ernie Souchok, a no nonsense investigative reporter with a habit of ticking off the wrong people.  Ernie loves Chicago and the big city life. When death threats become a little too real, he is sent on assignment to interview a reclusive ornithologist (bird watcher) living in the Rockies (a.k.a. The Continental Divide).

Blair Brown plays Nell Porter, the ornithologist.  She prefers her eagles to other humans.  Therefore, Nell and Ernie mix like oil and water.  But Ernie and Nell realize that their individual passions are what make them attractive to each other.

A wild romance ensues but when it is safe for Ernie to return home he reluctantly returns to Chicago.  Of course the two are reunited in Chicago but she is committed to nature.  The end is wildly romantic and completely satisfying.

If you like the romantic comedies of the 40's, then Continental Divide is perfection.  John Belushi shows that he had the potential to be a top actor.  Blair Brown gives another solid performance and continued to build on her earlier work.

I was a teen when I first saw this movie and the impact it had on me is one that I will never forget.  I so much wanted to be her.  To protect our nation's symbol and make sure that the bald eagle would be around forever.  I am now all grown up and I am proud to say that I work not only with Bald Eagles but other birds of prey.

The movie shows that he is a compassionate person.  In short, I loved this movie I think that John Belushi is an extremely talented actor.

It only took me about five minutes to forget that it was John Belushi portraying Ernie Souchak. A top dog columnist who's forced out of town to do a safer article , at the request of his boss , to save him from danger. Blair Brown's Nell Porter, provides the perfect opposite, for Belushi's Souchak. The film has a very basic ""boy meets girl "" formula. However ,the script and actors take this film to an all time high. It is a very special film that provides very special and cinematic moments. I enjoyed it when I was a teenager and I hated love story's. But there's more to this tale than just a typical spin. Definately not a film to be missed.",1053388800,42,1112,4.707692307692308
1826905,5,B00008438W,"Maybe it's the fact that I used to watch cable television nearly every waking moment in the early 80's, but this is one of those classic movies I can never get enough of!
Ernie Souchak (John Belushi) is a Chicago reporter on assignment in the Rocky Mountains whose subject is environmentalist/bald eagle protector, Nell Porter (Blair Brown).  Overweight and out of shape, he tumbles and stumbles through hikes and climbs with his agile counterpart learning about the 'other world' that exists outside the hussle and bustle of city-life.  Initially turned off by the brazen Souchak, Porter slowly finds him midly attractive but always keeping her distance.
Without giving the entire story away, they wind up crossing paths again, this time in Souchak's town of Chicago.  And in a fresh take, the movie doesn't end in typical Hollywood fashion.
Afficionados of romantic comedies will absolutely love this film.  I, for one, developed a huge adolescent crush on the naturally beautiful and charming, Blair Brown.  There are definitely some tear-jerker scenes and I'm not afraid to admit they get me everytime.  Probably the fact that for a change, you saw John Belushi portraying an everyday charming guy everyone can relate to.  Even the still photos of John and Blair together on set, smiling and throwing snowballs at each other on the closing credits is enough to make a tear well up, knowing this was one of Belushi's final movies.

1826906,4,B00008438W,"""Continental Divide"" stars John Belushi as Ernie Souchak, a Chicago newspaper columnist (based on Mike Royko). Ernie loves Chicago; he is a true urbanite. When his hard-hitting stories about a corrupt city official bring threats to his life, his editor decides to protect him by sending him on a story out of town...waaay out of town. Ernie is sent to the Rocky Mountains to interview Nell (Blair Brown), a reclusive ornithologist. A huge fish out of water, Ernie struggles against the elements: an overweight chainsmoker in the high altitudes of the Rockies is not a pretty site. Eventually, Ernie finds the lovely Nell, and the city mouse locks horns with the country mouse almost immediately. But circumstances force Nell to take in the reluctant Ernie. As with most films like this, opposites attract, as Ernie does his best to assimulate to Nell's world. But things are heating up back in Chicago, and Ernie must come out of hiding, with Nell in tow, to set things right. Alas, Nell's home is in the mountains with her beloved eagles, so the couple must decide where true love's course will take them.  Belushi is very good as slob-with-a-heart Ernie, proving his comedic charm is just as funny mild as it is wild. Brown is beautiful and appealing. Lawrence Kasden wrote the script; it's a bit spotty in places, but overall it's a funny, charming romantic comedy that spotlights a kinder, gentler Belushi.",1047168000,2,1410,4.899581589958159
