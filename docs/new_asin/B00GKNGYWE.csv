8624145,2,B00GKNGYWE,"Cindy divides this workout into upper and lower body sections.  As I started the upper body section I noticed that she had absolutely no warm-up.  Immediately, you started out with football runs.  She also did a lot of burpees which were hard on my back.  She did them so fast that I had a hard time keeping up.  She also did some plank work incorporating the arms. At the end of the upper body workout I had not even worked up a sweat.  The lower body workout was more challenging. It really gave the glutes a workout. She alternated the toning exercises with bursts of cardio.  I will probably just use this DVD for the lower body exercises.  I also wish she had added a separate abdominal section as well.",1392163200,2,708,4.392307692307693
