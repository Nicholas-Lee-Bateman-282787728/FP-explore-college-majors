449793,3,6302296919,"As a big-time Jodie Foster fan, I try to watch any movie she appears in, yet I left BackTrack sitting on my shelf for basically several years before popping it in the old VCR (and, for the record, I have the 1992 Director's Cut version on VHS).  After hearing a reviewer I respect heap praise upon this film, I knew there must be something there that never came across to me on the box cover.  Actually, the film was better than I expected, yet it is not a film that distinguished itself in my eyes as anything very special.  Jodie Foster is, of course, terrific as always; Dennis Hopper does not wig out too many times; and a most interesting cast of characters come and go along the way.  The problem I have is with the characterization, which is not sufficient in my eyes to describe the transformation of Jodie Foster's character in the course of the events that play out.
Foster plays Anne Benton, an up-and-coming young artist (who uses a most unusual medium for her art) who forgets all about the front tire that blows out and almost causes her to wreck her car when she accidentally witnesses a gang-land hit.  Luckily, the Mafia bad guys in this movie can never seem to hit a moving target, so Anne escapes and goes immediately to the police, unaware of the true nature of this particular homicide until two hit men break into her home in an attempt to kill her and the police start expounding upon the virtues of the federal witness protection program.  She decides to make a run for it and try to build a new life elsewhere on her own.  The police want her as a witness, and the Mafia family run by Mr. Avoca ( an aged Vincent Price) just wants her silenced.  The Mafia man for the job is Milo (Dennis Hopper), an accomplished hit man who begins tracking Anne down as she moves across the country.  By the time he finds here, though, Milo has fallen in love with her, which is something of a no-no for a man in his profession.  He and Anne do not seem to be a natural match by any stretch of the imagination, and thus their evolving relationship just never makes complete sense to me, especially from Anne's perspective, and this is my main point of contention here with the film.  Anyway, the movie-long chase has to end somewhere, and the filmmakers do succeed in pulling off a pretty satisfying conclusion.
BackTrack does deserve better than the relative obscurity in which it has lain, although I would not consider this a great film by any means.  It is worth a look just for the surprising number of famous faces that grace the screen; besides Foster and Hopper you will see Charlie Sheen, Dean Stockwell (who speaks in one of the most ridiculous put-on voices I have ever heard), the aforementioned Vincent Price, Joe Pesci, and none other than Bob Dylan.  I love Bob Dylan and his music, but he really does not possess the charisma or talent necessary to be an actor.  Still, it is quite a hoot to see him pop up unexpectedly in the film in a small but quite memorable little scene.  All told, BackTrack does have a few interesting things to show the viewer above and beyond the sight of a young Jodie Foster working her magic in front of the cameras (without her clothes at one point, for those who care about that sort of thing).  I would not rush out and try to find a copy of the movie, but if it ever passes your way, it is certainly worth a couple hours' of your free time.",1058745600,6,3398,4.404153354632588

449795,4,6302296919,"This film has gotten much bad press.  For example an offish interviewer in US magazine in 1994 asked Jodie ""can you tell us how Backtrack"" (the 1990 bomb) happened"" as if the film were some sort of dark secret  Ms. Foster should be ashamed of.  Nonsense.  This was a good film with a  great cast and an interesting plot.  A hard-boiled hitman (Hopper) is sent  to track down and kill a reluctant mob witness (Foster) after finding her  he falls in love and can't kill her but can't really love her either.  The  films greatest line  Hopper:  ""I gave up my career for you"".  The  cinematography and lush location filming make it a treat to watch.  Jodie  has never looked better, especially in a wonderful scene where she rescues  a lamb, a noisy lamb, and cradles it in her arms against an Arizona  sunrise, beautiful.  There are two things however that make this film not  so good.  One is a contrived, TV cop show, style ending, the other is the  criminally stupid scene in which Hopper points a gun at Jodie and forces  her to strip and come to bed with him.  It is the most agonizing scene ever  filmed.  Ever.  Hopper should have talked to any of Ms. Fosters fans who  would have told him that she simply does not take her clothes off on film.  Ever.  He should have known that.  Nonetheless, the scenes of her LED box  art projects, which sell for $20,000 and up,  have messages like  ""Murder has it's sexual side"" are fascinating.  The film is worth  owning and watching, it is well crafted if misguided.  Sadly I have never  heard of Dennis Hopper ever directing a big budget film ever again.  It's a  shame.",936144000,11,1616,4.437931034482759

449897,4,6302296919,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

BACKTRACK: Artist Anne Benton (Foster) has a flat tire on the freeway one night; as shes walking for help, she stumbles into a Mob murder. She escapes, but they're onto herand after her. A failed hit convinces her of the seriousness of the situation, but when the cops cant protect her, she disappears herself. The Mob calls in Mr. Milo (Hopper), the best hitman in the business.

Mr. Milos method of tracking is to get to know everything about the missing person, then intuit her thought process. The cops use computers. They find her simultaneously. She bolts again, this time to New Mexico. Mr. Milo finds her first, but his method has finally backfired on him, and when he confronts her, he offers her a choice: Hell let her live, but shell belong to him. The real twist is that hes such a sensitive gentleman that she might just grow to like this kinky kidnapping fantasy...

Discussion: Murder has its sexual side, reads a line in one of artist Annes language art machinesand that sums up this stylish modern noir thriller-with-a-difference. Is Anne a victim of the Stockholm Syndrome, where kidnap victims identify with their captorsor is there something deeper and more primal at work here?

What sets this film apart from most others is that it is in essence an animus fantasy, as delineated by Swiss psychologist Carl Jung: A womans fearful fancy of kidnap and seduction by a dark stranger full of sensual menace. As such, it explicates themes the original noir films could only hint at, like the vagaries of dominance and submission.

Backtrack goes to great lengths to show off Fosters sexy side, and when the pair become lovers on the lam, chased by both the Mob and the cops, the humorous undercurrents bubble upeven a simple lovers spat could prove deadly. Every member of the great cast looks like he or she is having fun. And an entire essay could be written about this films curious and circuitous history. (Simply, the video company that produced it for theatrical release went bankrupt, and it sat on a shelf for years before going straight to tape.) Backtrack is a fascinating film based on the female psyche; an action flick even women can enjoy.",1423180800,2,2423,4.678403755868545

449900,2,6302296919,"Big names, mediocre presentation. The story was probably much better than the movie. Directed by Hopper (1989 - maybe his first directing effort).  Foster's acting during the first half of the film was believable, but then the screen play made a big change in the character's personality (seemingly overnight).  There was no realistic connection between Hopper's character and Foster's considering the initial buildup of her character as a self-motivated and very confident woman. Hopper's character was so erratic it was confusing and did little to support the story line.  The supporting cast did not help the film. They seemed to be trying to fit the stereotyped Mafioso, but seemed comical at times.

449939,5,6302296919,"This movie is a complete mess, but I liked it nonetheless. I like it not for its plot, cinematography, or acting, which are all horrible, but for the very fact that it is a great bad movie. I couldn't decide at most points if it was a comedy or a drama. Dennis Hopper plays a huge saxophone at different points in the movie for no reason whatsoever. In one scene he tries unsuccessfully to throw it through a window, but it keeps bouncing off. I don't know what the saxophone is supposed to say about his character, if anything, but it was one of the best scenes in the history of made-for-cable cinema. I'm not sure if Hopper (who is also the director) meant for it to make the character he was playing have some emotional depth, or if it was just a gag.

The plot was typical late night Skinemax late 80's/early 90's crime drama, with a plot that you've seen in dozens of other movies. Jodie Foster, witness to a murder, goes on the run, tracked by assassins, obligatory shower scene, etc. But WAIT! She falls in love with one of the men sent to kill her. After he RAPES her. That's right, Jodie Foster says the next day ""You are a kidnapper and a rapist"" to Dennis Hopper. Ok, that means Hopper is a bad guy, and Jodie Foster will get back at him later in the movie. However, after Hopper creepily asks her to wear some lingerie that night, she sees something else in him. Now, the night before, he made her wear some lingerie and she was offended but did it anyway because he had a gun and then he raped her. But now, ONE DAY after she was RAPED, he makes her do the same thing and for some reason it was different and she falls in love with him. The next morning, they both acted like they were on a honeymoon. Hopper raped her until she fell in love with him. No, I thought, Jodie Foster is just pretending so Hopper will let his guard down so she can kill him. NO! They are in love throughout the whole movie. I even waited through the first part of the credits when they were still on the screen thinking that she might shoot him as the credits roll up because this is a Dennis Hopper movie and anything can happen when the director is on drugs but NO, they are still in love! Unbelievable. This is what makes this movie great.

The thing about Backtrack is that it is obviously a movie that was hashed out (pardon the pun) in one drug-fueled night at Dennis Hopper's Venice compound. He then called all of his friends and asked them to be in the movie, which he would direct. Out of obligation, they all agreed, as this movie is packed with A-list stars. Even Charlie Sheen, who in 1990 was riding his Platoon stardom to the top of the Hollywood pyramid, was convinced to take a role in which he comes on screen, eats a pizza, and is shot 10 times in the chest, all within 5 minutes. Joe Pesci is the crime boss, and his directions from Hopper were obviously, ""Go crazy like you did in Goodfellas, or whatever, I'll be over here at the deli tray"". But WAIT, Pesci is not the crime boss, as Hopper drags out his octogenarian buddy Vincent Price and inserts his withered form (obviously in post production) into the movie as an even bigger, completely unnecessary crime boss. Jodie Foster is hotter than I've ever seen her in this movie but it is clear that she can't wait for filming to wrap so she can put this film, which Hopper surely guilt-tripped her into, in the past. John Turturro is the one actor who seems to care and actually does something with his worthless part. The guy from Quantum Leap (no the other guy) is here too but he can be seen in the background on the phone to his agent trying to get a commercial gig later in the day. You can see him asking Hopper if he can leave the set by 1:00 so he can do the Meow Mix spot.

In all, this movie is complete garbage. At one time, it could have wowed audiences with it's star power and action, but in the post Pulp Fiction world of gritty, intelligent crime movies, Backtrack has not aged well. Thank you, Dennis Hopper, for this terrible movie.",1363737600,,4016,4.281578947368421
449940,4,6302296919,"This is one of those films that doesn't really fit into any category. It is strange to the point of being just plain weird. But, somehow, thanks I guess to the stars, it works. This was before Jody Foster became so obsessed with herself and could actually play a role as it was written. Dennis Hopper fits this perfectly. It's not a comedy but it's funny at times. It's a study of a somewhat insane, evil man who falls in love with his intended victim. One thing you totally believe is that he is obsessed with her from the first time he sees her and is helpless to do anything other than what he does. She is a study in what often happens to a victim. She becomes attached to her captor because her fear of what could happen to her is so much stronger than her fear of him. After all, she can handle him and he will protect her. She is afraid to be without him. I saw part of it on t.v. many years ago and went out and bought a copy so I could watch the whole thing. If it were not for Dennis Hopper it would just be an unbelievable mess but he is brilliant in this role.",1350172800,,1072,4.037558685446009
449941,2,6302296919,"Backtrack (1990) or  Catchfire, is a release that would have
been fine in 1977 or 1979, at best, but never in 1990. The music
soundtrack is pure 1970's and  the drama-style is 1970's TV-grade.

That the script seems to have been written on a restaurant's paper
napkin is suggested for many reasons, such as the fact that the audience
sees Jodie Foster's character adheres to an overnight transformation
as Dennis Hopper's lover, which is not impossible, but not in the way
the movie lays it out in the story. Another aspect are the helicopter
battles, almost taken from a James Bond 007 movie ...

What really holds this movie together, is the never-ending list of
A-grade movie stars, including also  Dean Stockwell  John Turturro
Tony Sirico Charlie Sheen  Joe Pesci and Bob Dylan, etc.

This really brings up the movie to 2/5 stars, otherwise, it would
have stayed at the bottom, such as 1/5.

At the end of the day, the story lacks depth and sophistication, doesn't
come close to 3 dimensional, despite the star-quality effort from Foster

449942,4,6302296919,"[The present review refers to the full-length edition of the movie] Literally by accident succesful conceptual artist Anne (Jodie Foster) watches the mob (Vincent Price, Joe Pesci, Dean Stockwell) murder some of its own. The police is eager to use her as a witness, and the clumsy gangsters are just as eager to get rid of her before the trial. Anne flees and tries to build up a new identity. Enter sinister hitman Milo (Dennis Hopper) hired by the mob. Milo and the not too intelligent police officers use some of the same means to track her down, but Milo has a tool of his own - using Anne's art he tries to find out how she thinks. He succeeds and that leads him to her hiding place, but meanwhile he becomes obsessed with the image he has built up of her. After abducting rather than killing Anne Milo offers her the choice between death and becoming his - providing her with perfect freedom of choice in his opinion. Thus in the first and mot interesting hour of the movie Milo and Anne come to look more and more like Clegg (Caliban) and Miranda in John Fowles' book ""The Collector"". Then the movie totally loses direction. It seems like the director (Dennis Hopper, uncredited with good reason) has read too much about the much-hyped ""Stockholm-syndrome"", and the inconsistent message of the last 35 minutes of the movie seem to be, that women can only thrive, if they are put in their proper place by a firm and somewhat older alpha male - and behind their cool surface even the toughest alpha males are just fetishistic slaves of weird obsessions.
There are two good reasons to watch this movie: Dennis Hopper's chilling acting in the first hour or so (the temperature drops, when Hopper enters the screen wearing some of the largest sunglasses this reviewer has ever seen), and Jodie Foster's extraordinary acting throughout the movie where she shows even more different expressions and emotions than she did in ""The Accused"". Just don't expect to find any consistency in the story and don't waste your time wondering, why Jodie Foster looks much younger and even more beautiful when she gets abducted and raped, than when she succesfully pursues her career.

The DVD contains no extras except an outdated filmography for Foster, Hopper and Stockwell.

It is very difficult to decide, how many stars this movie deserves. The story is ridiculous and the camerawork etc. is not noteworthy, but Foster's and to a lesser degree Hopper's acting make the movie worth watching; but their combined efforts in front of the cameras just can't compensate for the ridiculous story line and the mistakes made later in the cutting room.",1296259200,,2634,4.774122807017544

Jodie Foster plays an artist who happens to witness a mob killing. She manages to escape but the mob fins out where she lives and kills no her but, by accident, her boyfriend (Charlie Sheen). She is offered to be taken into a witness protection program but instead goes into hiding on her own. Hopper plays the hitman that is hired to kill her. But he likes her and offers her her life in return for her company and obedience. Afer a while she starts to actually like the man. And here's the movie's main flaw. The relationship between Hopper and Foster develop from hostile to friendly much too quickly to feel realistic. I haven't seen the director's cut but maybe the character development feels more believable in that version. On the plus side, it's well acted.

A woman artist witnesses a Mafia murder and goes to the police. However, she recognizes one of the cops as one of the hit men and goes on the run.  The bad guys want her dead and even hire their own hit man who becomes obsessed with her.  That's the kind of story I like, especially as Jodie Forster is cast as the woman and Dennis Hopper is cast as the hit man.  Also in the cast are Dean Stockwell as the crocked cop, Bobby Dillon as a fellow artist, John Tuturro and Tony Sirico (Paulie on of The Sopranos fame) as mobsters, and there's even a cameo by Vincent Price.

My expectations for this film didn't pay off, however.  From the very beginning, when Jodie Foster's car breaks down and she witnesses the mob hit, I found myself annoyed.  There she was, leaving her car, wearing high heels and a skimpy dress and not even carrying a purse.  Later, it was just too easy for her to change her identity.  She went to a cemetery, found a gravestone of a woman who would have been her age, and applied for a birth certificate and a social security card.  Also, the technology of the time (1990) was certainly not sophisticated enough for Dennis Hopper to go to a computer screen and track her identity change.

All the characters came across as exaggerated comic strip caracatures  and I found myself laughing out loud when they tried to be serious.  Perhaps this was the director's intention, but the film just couldn't hold my attention.  I wanted to turn it off after ten minutes but hoped it would get better.  Somehow I watched for another forty minutes before ejecting the DVD disk with disgust at such a waste of talent.

If you've never heard of this film I can well understand why.  It was simply a dud.  I have only one thing to say about this film.  Forget about it!",1112400000,5,1910,4.387464387464387

It's a hatchet job.  Very sad and SO maddening that an intriguing film in which one could luxuriate has been turned into a goofy trivialization.  And I can't return it because I've opened it.",1109289600,20,352,4.3538461538461535

449964,2,6302296919,"BACKTRACK is unbelievably dopey. Its only redeeming factor is that Jodie Foster shows an eye-popping amount of flesh - and it's no body double. And what a great set of legs! That's why I'm awarding two stars, one for each gam, which just goes to show the sophistication level of the film (AND my review of it).
Anne Benton (Foster) is a ""conceptual artist"", which means, in the wacky Southern California milieu in which she has her gallery, she creates pieces using message board displays.  You know, those where one line of illuminated text moves right to left across a long and narrow screen. Anyway, one night after experiencing a flat tire on the freeway, she witnesses a mob hit on the premises of an oil refinery. (For those LA viewers, it's the one just off the 405 south of LAX where the freeway curves to the east above Palos Verdes.) Like a good citizen, she goes to the police, who realize that they have in Benton a valuable witness against organized crime, and specifically against Big Boss Mr. Avoca (Vincent Price). But after her apartment is invaded and her boyfriend (a quickly expendable Charlie Sheen) shot to death, Anne realizes neither the cops nor the Feds can protect her, so she flees town and establishes a new identity and career. To hunt her down, mob goodfella Leo Carelli (Joe Pesci) hires the saxophone-playing assassin Milo (Dennis Hopper), who tracks her across the West using computer databases. The thing is, he begins to obsess about Anne after finding photos of her (un)dressed in dominatrix accessories. Milo has issues.
The plot has a Keystone Cops quality as law enforcement seeks to retrieve Benton by following Milo. And after the latter severs communication with his employers in favor of his own agenda of infatuation, Leo's thugs go after Milo and Anne by following the cops. Even then, the storyline might've been redeemable if it hadn't taken such a Bonnie and Clyde twist, and the conclusion (at that same refinery) is positively ludicrous.
Hopper as Milo is almost the caricature of a mob hit man. Where did he get those clothes, that hat, and that accent? And speaking of accents, Leo's lawyer John Luponi (Dean Stockwell) has to be one of the most over-acted roles in recent memory. If it didn't get a Razzie Award, it should've.
Perhaps even the cast realized what a disaster BACKTRACK is. Joe Pesci, whose role is not insignificant, isn't even listed on the ending credits. I wonder if he tried to buy up all the prints?
A dedicated Jodie fan will perhaps wax rhapsodic over her nude shower scene. Beyond that, don't bother.",1080432000,10,2577,4.778026905829597
449965,4,6302296919,"the running time on the VHS version that i've got says 102 minutes, approximate. it's on Vestron and on the back of the cover is two rows of three pictures: John Turturro, Jodie Foster, Dean Stockwell, Fred Ward, Dennis Hopper, and Vincent Price. Charlie Sheen makes an appearance as does Joe Pesci in a major role, yet he's not credited...but this movie is a good one. frankly, i could care less about the technical stuff behind the scenes about which version is which and all that...the VHS i have is just perfect and that's fine with me. the story is about a woman {Foster} who sees a mob hit and the Mafia {Avoca, played by legend Vincent Price} sends a hit-man {Hopper} out to kill Foster's character {Anne Benton}. hit-man Milo falls for Benton instead and soon the police get involved {Fred Ward is hilarious even though he's not suppose to be!}. Milo and Anne find themselves running from the police AND the mafia {Dean Stockwell appears as Avoca's mouthpiece throughout the whole film since Vincent only has three very brief scenes}. yes, Bob Dylan appears in the movie too! the film was made in 1989, according to some Vincent Price items i've read over the years. THEN, the film was re-released in 1991 on Showtime as ""Catchfire""...then in 1992 it was called ""Backtrack"" again for the VHS i'm reviewing!",1079136000,4,1314,4.717391304347826
