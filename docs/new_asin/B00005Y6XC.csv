1674889,5,B00005Y6XC,"I happened to catch this movie on TV one night and, being a Kenneth Branagh fan, I watched it and was thrilled.  Kenneth plays the part perfectly and it is laugh-out-loud funny sometimes and heartbreaking in others.  Highly recommended.",1066867200,8,236,5.0256410256410255
1674890,4,B00005Y6XC,"This is one of the most intelligently written movies i've seen in quite some time.  It is about, appropriately, a writer struggling to be a writer and a regular person.  The segue scenes of a local morning talk show interview are wickedly funny and Kenneth Branagh is, as ever, completely credible in his role as a struggling writer, troubled by a dog, a doppelganger, and ovulation.",1060732800,5,383,4.787878787878788
1674891,5,B00005Y6XC,"I picked up a copy of this movie at a local library. I admire both Kenneth Branagh, and Robin Wright Penn; and the title was what intrigued and amused me. This is a delightful movie. The script is fast, witty and intelligent. Branagh reciting the phone book would be poetry to me. The little girl does a fabulous job. How she enchants Branagh into thinking that kids are probably not that bad after all, and the inevitable confrontation between him and the child's mother over the dancing lessons beautifully illustrated the difficulties of an over-protective parent vs another who sees only the child's open spirit, and will to try despite a physically challenged condition. Fans of Penn and Branagh will seek this out anyway, but it deserves to be seen and enjoyed by a much wider audience. Don't let the title put you off. Go see it and be charmed and enchanted too.",1034726400,2,869,4.686274509803922
1674892,4,B00005Y6XC,"First of all, the biggest obstacle to enjoying and appreciating this movie is the fact that the title alone is going to keep it out of most people's hands.  Let's face it, when the average, discerning viewer browsing the local video store shelves comes across one called ""How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,"" it immediately gets mentally shuffled into the mindbox right alongside such obtuse fare as the consummately repugnant and forgettable ""Surf Nazis Must Die,"" (which, by the way, is a title I never thought would issue forth from my fingertips for any reason whatsoever, but it happens to work here) or the likes.  I mean, slapping on such a designation is like insisting on a strike three call with the first pitch when you're the batter.  Then again, there's that old saying about judging a film by it's cover.  Take ""Office Space,"" for example; who in a million years would have expected something as entertaining and insightful from Mike Judge, the guy who gave the world Beavis and Butthead, for crying out loud?  (Still, in retrospect, Beavis and Butthead wasn't half bad...).  The point is, writer/director Michael Kalesniko did himself a major disservice with his title, which may have been a shock value attempt to grab some attention that didn't really work out.  But if you can overcome what for most will surely be an entirely understandable prejudice against this one, you'll be in for a treat.  And in the final analysis, it points up the wisdom of not dismissing any movie out-of-hand.
Hollywood denizen Peter McGowan (Kenneth Branagh) is a successful playwright, but in the show biz tradition of ""what have you done for me lately?"" he is having trouble getting his latest play off to a running start.  Rehearsals have begun, but even director Brian Sellars (David Krumholtz) can't seem to find the magic.  And poor Peter is experiencing a heavy hit of writer's block that is preventing him from fixing it, and working out of his home doesn't seem to be the answer.  Wife Melanie (Robin Wright Penn) is supportive, but they have no children of their own, and pursuant of her natural motherly instincts, she has taken on eight-year-old Amy Walsh (Suzi Hofrichter), daughter of new neighbor and single mom Trina (Lucinda Jenney), to babysit.  In addition to which there is a ""False Peter"" (Jared Harris) roaming about the neighborhood, a fan, apparently, who has taken on Peter's identity, and to top it all off, the neighbor's dog just will not quit barking.  Suffice to say Peter is not seeing the world through rose colored glasses these days, but there has to be an answer to his many and myriad dilemmas; now all he has to do is find it.
Perhaps sabotaging his own film with a title that instantly relegated it to ""cult"" status was Kalesniko's way of getting into his alter-ego's skin and exploring Peter's conundrum and his possible reactions.  And if such was the case, it worked.  Because once you give this film a chance, you'll find that it's funny, poignant and actually filled with some pretty astute insights into and observations of the human condition.  This is a black comedy/drama, to be sure, but at the heart of the film there is a dramatic story that will evoke no small amount of empathy and compassion from the audience.  Which is to say, with this film you get so much more than what you bargained for; it is decidedly NOT what you're expecting based on the title alone.  There are a couple of instances in which Kalesniko succumbs to a bit of unnecessary low-brow humor, but it's not enough to detract from the whole.  In the end, this film dips deeply into the pockets of human nature to extract the kind of sentiments (without being sentimental) rarely found in a film of this genre, and it makes a positive and lasting impression.
The role of a transplanted Brit insomniac playwright with writer's block must have seemed like a character out of a dream for Kenneth Branagh, who totally immerses himself in Peter and comes up with a winning and memorable portrayal.  The character was obviously well written to begin with, but Branagh takes hold of the part and runs with it, making it entirely his own by lending the kind of depth and nuance to it that really brings Peter to life.  The development of the character is effected extremely well, too, as initially, Peter is a guy who is not necessarily likable, with quirks and peccadilloes aplenty.  But as the story progresses, so does Peter, and there's some tender moments along the way that are quite unexpected, given the attitude and bearing Peter starts out with.  And it's the way Branagh brings his character around that makes it work; it evolves rather than coming from a sudden left turn out of nowhere.  Peter finally has a ""breakthrough,"" and it comes from a place that is completely unanticipated.  It's a solid performance, and one of the rewards that comes from successfully navigating past Kalesniko's questionable title.
Robin Wright Penn is also impressive in her role as Melanie, though it's not too much of a stretch for her artistically.  But it's one of those straightforward ""normal"" characters that seem so easy to play they are often taken for granted (Easy?  Let he among you who has acted in front of a camera without once looking at it cast the first stone).  The real find here, however, is the young Hofrichter, who is endearing and totally effective as Amy, a young girl with her own challenges to overcome.
The supporting cast includes Lynn Redgrave (Edna), Peter Riegert (Larry), Johnathon Schaech (Adam), Derek Kellock (Amy's Father) and Peri Gilpin (Debra).  Happening upon this film is like ordering a hamburger and being served filet mignon for the same price; and it makes ""How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog"" a thoroughly satisfying and fulfilling cinematic experience.  Give it a try.",1031443200,12,5814,4.8199195171026155
1674893,5,B00005Y6XC,"If it weren't for the title of this film, I'm almost certain I would never have picked it up off the shelf at my local video store.
The story surrounds Kenneth Branagh (of Dead Again fame), who is a struggling playright, trying vainly to come up with a new play.  He's hampered by multiple problems:  writer's block, new neighbors, his huge previous successes, his wife (played excellently by Robin Wright --- of The Princess Bride movie) wanting to have a child, and -- to put icing on the cake -- a new dog next door that barks incessantly for most of the evening.
This movie is loaded with both crude and touching humor.  The scene where Kenneth goes to visit his doctor for a check of his prostate still stands out in my mind!  And when Kenneth fights with his wife (Wright) about having children, and he keeps farting in bed (to avoid having sex) prior to her coming into the bedroom, are significant and well acted.
The ending is both poignant and funny, a rare combination that hollywood has trouble finding.  The neighbor kid, Amy (played by a TREMENDOUS little actor named Suzi Hofrichter) has some amazing screen time with Kenneth and Robin and her ending scene can bring tears to even the shallowest of hearts.
In the end, this movie will make you laugh, cry and wonder about the human nature of men, women and kids and how we affect one another on a daily basis.  Fun.  Watch it.

1674894,4,B00005Y6XC,"Although I agree with most other reviewers about the not so cool DVD, I totally enjoyed this dark comedy. It all started with a writer's block then developed itself into a rich portrait of life reflecting utmost hilarity and sensitivity at the same time -- hence the touchy tagline ""One man's pet is another man's peeve"". Kenneth Branagh who became one of my favorite actors for his role in Woody Allen's ""Celebrity"" delivered another excellent leading role that was beautifully matched up by the performances of Robin Wright (Forrest Gump's lovely Jenny) and Suzi Hofrichter as little Amy. My only hope is that the producers will release an enhanced letterboxed DVD later on. I wouldn't mind to spend a few more bucks to  have this movie in my collection.",1018742400,5,756,4.8604651162790695
1674895,3,B00005Y6XC,"That this film received a very limited release after languishing on the shelf for a year or so after completion comes as no surprise - its stars struggle valiantly with the muddled script, but too often to no avail. OK as a rental if your first several choices are out . . . not that anyone would want to buy it at the outrageous price being charged for it!  Save your money for the CD promised for release later this year, since it will cost considerably less and will feature the best performance in the film - that by Petula Clark, whose 60s tunes are sprinkled liberally throughout the film.  It's too bad the on-screen talent fails to match her glorious work on the soundtrack.",1017619200,,682,4.448
1674896,5,B00005Y6XC,"This is a terrific comedy with a great ensemble cast. Kenneth Branagh is really funny as the guy who can't sleep because of the neighbor's barking dog.
But think twice about buying the DVD; apparently it will be a full screen pan and scan version with no extras. So try to catch it while it's in theaters - it'll be worth it!",1013126400,5,325,4.258064516129032
1674897,5,B00005Y6XC,"This is a very funny and smart film. The ensemble cast is terrific.
Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn are a great pairing and you will enjoy seeing them on the screen together.
If you can, see the film in theaters, because the VHS and DVD releases will be a full-screen pan and scan version that doesn't do the film justice. Maybe someday down the road they'll do better releases.
Branagh plays a once-famous playwright workshopping his latest play. And it's not going too well. How he deals with this and all the other problems - including the neighbor's new barking dog - is  a lot of fun to watch.",1013040000,9,604,4.490909090909091

1674910,5,B00005Y6XC,"My second review of this film. A funny, charming, poignant film about a self-involved writer's journey to becoming his better self, a MENSCH.

Kenneth Branagh has the role of a lifetime, if only the world knew about it. It's one comic utterance after another. Follow the zingers going back and forth between him and the TV interviewer who clearly is annoyed that he is getting the upper hand. FUNNY.

There's a sweet relationship that develops between Branagh's character and the little girl next door, sweet but not mawkish, no heavy-handed direction here. Gradual and realistic evolution of the hero is on display here. Apparently this film did not get good distribution, otherwise it would be better known. Robin Wright and Lynn Redgrave give fine performances as well. I like this film so much, I am STILL trying to get my sister and niece on the West Coast to view it. They don't know what they are missing.",1349481600,4,912,4.802547770700637
1674911,5,B00005Y6XC,"In writer/director Michael Kalesniko's HOW TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOG, Branagh is an LA-based playwright who was hot in the '80s but has written only flops recently. Wife Wright wants a baby, which renders Branagh impotent, perhaps intentionally. He's miserable, can't sleep because of a neighbor's barking dog, is a chain-smoker and is in rehearsals on a new play, one that's still being written and fought over by cast and fey director. Wright's mom (Redgrave), who's apparently dying a piece at a time and is often quite incoherent, lives with them.

When a single mother moves in next door, Branagh and Wright become attached to her daughter, a girl with mild multiple sclerosis. Finally, there's Branagh's doppelg&auml;nger, a weirdo stalker who wanders near the house at nght. This oddball really, really, really thinks he's the playwright. When Branagh meets him one early morning, he becomes friends with this wannabe. It all sounds strange and it is, but this is also a dark comedy filled with hearty laughs.

Highly recommended.

I anticipated it's arrival, when it came and I watched it, I thought it was kind of cute, but at times, the humor felt rather strained. In retrospect, a move to rent, not to buy. As a Brit married to an American woman, I could identify with the main character to some extent, but not as much as Hugh Grant in 'did you hear about the Morgan's?)

1674914,3,B00005Y6XC,"This film is pretty good. I just saw it not more than 30 minutes ago, and it was fantastic. Academy Award nominee Kenneth Branagh (""William Shakespeare's Henry V,"" ""Dead Again,"" ""William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" ""William Shakespeare's Hamlet,"" ""William Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost"") and Robin Wright Penn (""The Princess Bride"") star in this witty look at life's little quirks. The comedy is spot-on, from Peter doing whatever he can do avoid sex while struggling to write a new play and a noisy dog that keeps barking at night to his mother-in-law's constantly forgetting who her son-in-law is. The reason I give this movie three stars instead of five is because-SPOILER!!! I think the movie should have ended with Amy's mother realizing what an overprotective b---- she is and allowed Amy to stay with Peter and his wife. SPOILER OVER!!! Jared Harris (Professor James Moriarty in the upcoming Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows) has a great bit as a homeless man claiming to be Peter. My only other complaint with this movie is...did they really have to make the director (David Krumholtz) a homo? that disgusting aspect really threw me off and...e[...] fortunately, none of his activities are depicted on screen.

1674915,5,B00005Y6XC,"This is my first review of this film. One day in 2012 I forgot I had reviewed it, and reviewed it again! Decided to leave both reviews up. I must really like it, huh? Very biting, funny--also some poignant, bittersweet moments.  Kenneth Branagh is just wonderful in the role of a playwright struggling with his new play, his wife's desire for a baby, his irritation about the dog next door, and the fact that he is being ""stalked"" by a harmless, sad-and-looney doppelganger!  Some of the film borders on the crude, but it never becomes really offensive.  The lead character evolves in the film and that is nice to watch.  There's a little-girl-next-door character that interacts with the Branagh character and with his wife, played by Robin Wright.  That's the heart of the movie, and the child actor's performance is a joy to watch.  Finally, the Petula Clark songs brighten and enhance the film, and Lynn Redgrave is very good as Kenneth Branagh's mother-in-law, losing her memory and slowly fading away.  Don't miss this one.",1298419200,5,1028,4.84

1674918,2,B00005Y6XC,"1 - there is so much mumbling that I had to use the spanish subtitles
2 - is there a more obvious plot than the curmudgeon opening up in  the presence of innocence?
3 - what about the 'play within a play' is supposed to signal the viewer that Peter is a great writer?  It seemed SOOO trite.  And the production team seemed to just sit around and wait for it to get better.  It would have helped if there had been some exposition about why they hired the theatre BEFORE he finished the play.
4 - why was the neighbor lady so black and white?  Why were the media interviews so ham-handed?  Why would Peter do them if they were always like that ?
5 - could also have used some exposition on why Peter's wife loves him and why she remains so cheery while he is such a pill.  There is no indication that he is usually nicer when he doesn't have writer's block.

I chose this film because y'all raved about it and because of Branagh.  I think the best thing was the child actor.  She was great.  And it was a good choice to have her mildly handicapped as a parrallel to Peter's highly functioning person who doesn't fit in.",1254614400,,1117,4.172897196261682
1674919,3,B00005Y6XC,"Kenneth Branagh is a famous Shakespearian actor who seems really out of place in a slow human drama in which he plays an aging playwright

1674924,5,B00005Y6XC,"Originally saw ""How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog"" when director Michael Kalesniko brought it to the Kansas City Film Festival.

He was trying to get word of mouth working for the film, as (from what he said) was the studio refusing to release it unless he changed the title.

Now I've had difficulty recommending this jem to some people, because as soon as I mention the title...

But it is an exceptional little film. Crisp writing. Tight, witty dialogue. And really funny bits.

Kenneth Branagh & Robin Wright Penn stand out brilliantly as the featured couple. Other actors shine in smaller parts. But the work of Suzi Hofrichter as the new neighbor's daughter will really win you over.

One might quibble that filming what is supposed to be Los Angeles in Vancouver, Canada is a stretch (can you really see your breath at night in L. A.?), one can easily overlook that mismatch. Because the film is terrific.

It may not have seen wider release, but you'd do better buying ""How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog"" than renting anything Adam Sandler has ever produced.

1674925,4,B00005Y6XC,"'How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog' is exactly a kind of film that some lucky audiences pick up at a rental video store by chance, but whose existence many people still don't know even though Robert Redford is executive producer.  Or is it that he is not famous any more?

But flawed as it is, 'How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog' is so witty and charming thanks to the stars Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn.  One merit is that Branagh plays Peter, who is a playwriter for stage, is an Englishman in LA, and is deliciously cynical.  No actor is suitable for the role, and he gives one of his best performances on screen.  And this playwright is in a slump; for all his fame (of the past years) and confidence, he cannot write good characters and dialogues, especially those of a 10-year-old child in his upcoming play.

And Peter's wife is Melanie played by Robin Wright Penn (in a  black wig).  She wants a baby, but her husband is not so willing.  In between their frustrated relations steps a cute girl Amy (Suzi Hofrichter) who moved into their neighborhood with her mother.

While Amy comes to get closer to Melanie and Peter, they also come to know the little girl.  There are many eccentric characters (this film is partly about the stage); Jonathan Scharch as stage actor in Peter's play, Jared Harris as 'false' Peter, and Lynn Redgrave as Peter's mother-in-law who keeps forgetting that she is Peter's mother-in-law.  And look for uncredited cameo of Daniel Stern at party scene.

The story itself is nothing exceptional.  It is the round characters that are exceptional in 'How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog' and the gifted actors playing them effectively.  The acting is unanimously great, and when those interesting and real characters deliver the funny lines by Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn, the film becomes a little gem.  One scene in which Peter understands 'how a Muppet feels' made me laugh.

Perhaps you haven't seen it, and that's not a big surprise.  I'm writng from Japan, but it took about five years for us to see it.  And we have seen it in theaters, and think it's good.  So how come its US debut was on cable TV?",1112659200,13,2148,4.617414248021108

But barking dogs, well, see the movie and know that I agree that nothing is worse than being kept awake by one.

Mostly the movie is about acceptance.  She wants a baby, and he feels about babies the same way he feels about barking dogs.  But, no suspense here, that all changes when he actually meets a child, and falls in love with her.  He realizes kids can be great, and funny, and interesting, and smart, and that, surprise, you can learn from them because they are not jaded yet.

I thought I would take a chance, since most of the reviews were favorable. Well, big disappointment. The gags and punch lines, just did not strike me as very humorous, and Branagh, although he tries very hard, is simply miscast. The major fault lies within the writing & directing of Michael Kalesniko. I had high hopes for this film, but in my opinion, it falls flat, and I was impatient for it to finish. Thank God it was only 50 cents. Pass on this one.",1364428800,,598,4.445454545454545
