7977004,5,B00007JZOA,"Love this series.  I was introduced to it by a friend while I was in film school.  Tried to buy the box set, but people were begging WAY too much for it.  Found getting the series this way was much easier and cheaper.  Plus, you get all kinds of really great artwork.  Either way, this is one of my favorite Animes.  Get these while you still can.",1356998400,,347,4.104477611940299
