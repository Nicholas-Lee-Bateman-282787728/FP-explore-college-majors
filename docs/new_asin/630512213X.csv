The plot concerns  an urban legend that may or may not be true that if the boxer in the ring sees a character named Paddy sitting somewhere in the arena he will die. It's as simple as that. The setting is a cheap boxing ring, the era is that of the London Blitz, thus there is already dread in the air. I shall not spoil the ending except to say that although it was abrupt I found it effective, while many people don't.

The problem may be that many viewers approach the show in too logical or linear a frame of mind, so if the ""payoff"" comes from ""out of the blue"", as it does in this episode, they feel cheated. I found that the ending lent an air of mystery to the story. It wasn't satisfying dramatically, probably wasn't intended to be. The show's episodes tended to provoke rather than explain, which is a huge factor in why I like it.

John Newland's on screen appearance and air of genteel authority is a huge asset, and his closing remarks rather sealed the deal for me that this is a keeper. The Last Round is a fine introduction to the unique One Step Beyond series, spooky at times, yet mild when one compares it to other entries in the series.",1248048000,,1245,4.2893617021276595
