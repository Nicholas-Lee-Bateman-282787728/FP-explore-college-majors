8178040,5,630512180X,"The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) is one of my favorite childhood films and, being the huge fan of Zavvi exclusive steelbooks that I am, this one has been on my list for a while.

Front:  Great artwork choice.  The inner borders are both embossed and debossed, but I appreciate how subtle and understated they are at first glance.  I know some collectors are not fans of the borders that Zavvi tends to use, but I think the purple really works well on this one; not too bright or too dark.

Inside:  Gorgeous!  This is probably my favorite aspect of the entire steelbook.  All of the films major characters are shown in clear and lively colors across both sides.  I personally do not like when steels have artwork on only one side, so this was an excellent choice for the inner artwork!  The solid blue blu-ray disc is a bit plain in comparison, though.

Back: Not bad, but this is probably the only part of the steel that I think should have been better.  The image of Quasimodo appears to be slightly blurry, which is somewhat disappointing considering the other images are so clear.

Overall, it is a great looking steelbook and I am so glad I own it!  The colors are what stand out the most; very vibrant and an instant reminder of how beautifully and colorfully animated the film is. I definitely recommend it to my fellow collectors!",1454112000,,1340,4.529166666666667

8178042,3,630512180X,"As you can see, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is not one of my favorite. The fact that the story doesn't match Victor Hugo's version doesn't affect me even a bit - I'm open to other suggestions! But the music is horrible and  the story is dark. Children don't want to be taught of the evil and the  goods. The animation is very impressive and beautiful. Fastival of fools is  drown beautifully but the characters aren't memorable and the movie lacks  the greatness of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The  Lion King. If you have another ulternative, it'd be better.",949708800,,584,4.631067961165049
