4596642,3,B0057I84YE,"First of all, I am only reviewing this because The Other Two Reviews Are Obviously Written By The Same Shift-Key Addict, and it pisses me off when somebody makes multiple accounts to give positive reviews to a product they probably had something to do with creating even if i generally agree with their review.

The stand-up is good, the animation is just alright, and the 'shorties' are generally disappointing. Patrice O'Neal and Nick DiPaolo are very funny comedians, but the script they read for this show was below the quality I came to expect from them. As I rewatch this I find myself wanting to fast-forward through the unfunny baby banter to get to the stand-up.",1322006400,,671,4.7844827586206895
4596643,5,B0057I84YE,"The short lived ( 13-14 ) Episode Series Shorties Watchin' Shorties is an INSTANT CLASSIC. Denis Leary and his Shorties Watchin' Shorties launched many Top Rated Comedian's or at the very least Increased their Stand-up Status. I can't believe that after only 14 Episodes only having aired 12-13 of them, let the Wildly Popular Series DIE. Now that Denis and his  Fire Fighting Cable Series has ended, maybe he and Comedy Central would Consider Reviving the BEST and ONLY Comedy & Animation Series to MAKE an STELLAR and WELL DESERVED COMEBACK. One can only hope the SHOW could HELP the VERY BEST STAND-UP COMEDIANS get there well deserved Recognition. The Artists in the Animation department did a GREAT JOB in Complimenting the VERY TALENTED COMEDIANS. I RATE the Complete Series SHORTIES WATCHIN' SHORTIES a (9.8) on a Scale from 1-10 ! I would have given it a 10, but because Comedy Central Chose not to include the NEVER AIRED EPISODES in the DVD COMPLETE SERIES including Wanda Sykes and others that participated in the MISSING or LOST EPISODES. THANK-YOU COMEDY CENTRAL and SPECIAL THANKS to Denis Leary, all the Comedians and Animation Artists.",1313193600,3,1151,4.963730569948186

4596649,2,B0057I84YE,"Seriously, why bother releasing these on DVD if they are censored?  It took forever to get released and the comedy skits are the bread n butter of the show, so a huge disappointment that these are no different than what was on Comedy Central.",1378166400,6,242,4.5

4596651,5,B0057I84YE,"This was a GREAT series.  The title was super dumb, and the baby part (pretty much filler, not the main part of show) is not very funny. But basically, they take stand up and put it to animation. It's HILLARIOUS. And I am pretty picky with my comedy!",1364428800,,250,4.208333333333333
4596652,5,B0057I84YE,"Okay, let me say this, I was a huge fan of this show when it was on the air on Comedy Central, so I knew what I was getting when I bought it. As this show was decently early on in the life of Comedy Central, it is likely many of you reading this did not, and probably do not know exactly what your getting into. So let me help:

'Shorties Watchin' Shorties' is two babies, played by Nick DaPaolo and Patrice O'Neal, who in each episode are somewhere watching animated shorts on television and comment in between the shorts about them. Basically it comes down to, do you like animation or not? And, moreover, rather crude animation? Because if your not a fan of animation, than do yourself a favor and pass this by!

If you do like animation...you are in for a treat...because...
While the animation itself is rather crudely drawn, the contents of it are very VERY funny! Each animated short basically brings to life a story by a stand up comic, and 'Shorties Watchin' Shorties' featured some great ones! (Mitch Hedburg, Greg Giraldo,
Patton Oswalt, Dane Cook, Lewis Black...to name just a few!) If your a big fan of stand up, especially of stand up by comedians who were on Comedy Central a lot during the late 1990s and first decade of the new millennium, than this is for you. Although, I will say, you likely will recognize quite a few of the stories or routines being told from stand up special's you have seen, but the animation, and the small details put into each, lend the routines a new life, put them in a different light, and in my opinion add rewatchability.

Finally, I gotta say, that this is one of those shows that the diehard fans of it when it was on air were waiting forever for it to be released on DVD, so a big thanks to Comedy Central for releasing it and to Amazon for printing the DVD-R's on demand!",1363132800,4,1824,4.390532544378698
4596653,2,B0057I84YE,"Huge fan of Patrice O'Neal and Nick Di Palo but, the cartoons were lame and I found myself fast forwarding the DVD to find
only to stop at their skits. If you are a fan of both their extrodinary talents, you won't be impressed view this.",1361750400,,237,4.173913043478261
4596654,5,B0057I84YE,"Shorties Watchin' Shorties was a hilarious show on Comedy Central.  Every fan of stand-up should own this DVD set.  True it's not family friendly, but the show is totally worth it!  Thank you God for Patrice O'neal, Greg Giraldo, and Mitch Hedberg.  If only Comedy Central had given it more time, it would have been legendary!",1345852800,,326,4.767857142857143
