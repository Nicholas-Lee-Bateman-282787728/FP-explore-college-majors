4081356,5,B0037FFB8Q,The DVD came sooner than I expected. It WAS brand new. Performed flawlessly. Can't say enough good about this transaction.,1297641600,,122,5.15
4081357,3,B0037FFB8Q,"The reviewers who posted before me raved about this film as one of the best. Based on my viewing of the DVD and the special features (but not the full director ""commentary""./ I have to disagree some. Even Director Peter Bogdonavich - who is Davi's friend and has a feature role in the film - says in his interview that it's a nice film made on a small budget. I agree with him.

Don't get this film looking for a doo-wop version of Eddie and the Cruisers or, my favorite That Thing You Do. There is a doo-wop soundtrack (licensed mostly from ABKCO) and a score in the mood of Nito Rota. Davi had the idea for the script in the 1970s and by the year 2007 or so raised enough money to make it. Look at the list of producers and executive producers... large! And many of the actors were his friends and neighbors.

But back to the story. It really started out slow for me and when I got to the scene with aging vocal group dressed up like tomatoes for a TV commercial, I also gave up. But I stuck it out and enjoyed the rest of the film. There are extraneous scenes that could have been cut (Chazz Palmintei's long bed scene with a very overweight woman - she's SUPPOSED to be that way, it's the ""joke"" - goes on too long. And the burglary gone wrong moves the story in a different direction. But the film has heart. I'll give it that.

I really enjoy Palminteri as an actor. His one man show on Broadway was a tour de force. Here he seems to be slumming. The wonderful British Actress Miriam Margoyles really only gets a few scenes. The surprise gem is veteran actor Joe Campenella as Zorro (You'll have to see the film to understand his name.) Here he only speaks Italian. (and for some reason, the two Italian-American cousins - Davi and Palminteri - can understand Italian. Go figure.

Worth a rental - it won some Film Festival awards (mostly in Europe) - but a ""masterpiece""? I think not..

BTW, the interview with Davi in the bonus section is worth watching. Its 17 minutes long but shows you how he realized his dream to get this film completed (and who helped him along the way.)

4081358,5,B0037FFB8Q,"I really enjoyed this film.  Great story, fun, likeable characters and excellent story flow.  It's family friendly, but can be equally enjoyed by adults too.",1274572800,,157,5.24
4081359,5,B0037FFB8Q,"Robert Davi has created an instant classic. I loved the film in the theater, and it is just as good if not better the second time around on DVD. Love the commentary on the disk. This film is very timely and will know doubt go down in history as a social commentary about these times we live in decades from now. Funny, quirkey, exciting and real. A nice break form the boring old studio formula films. Finally something new and original.",1273795200,5,437,4.407407407407407
4081360,5,B0037FFB8Q,"Robert Davi has always been a wonderful actor - as anyone who followed his career knows. But too often he was stuck in projects that were not worthy of his talent.  Now, at last, he has found the answer - write and direct his own films.  And ""The Dukes"" is his first such effort and it is a winner.  A great story that has both comedy and pathos.  A ""feel good"" movie that the whole family will enjoy.  And, best of all, Robert finally does some real singing - as opposed to the ""throw away"" bits in ""Goonies"" and several other films.  The man has so many talents - and this film does him proud.",1271116800,9,595,4.130434782608695
4081361,5,B0037FFB8Q,"This creation, from actor Robert Davi, was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning until end! I would recommend it for the whole family (except the little kids).

Judging from the song at the end, many of the actors have great singing voices, too. Somebody told me that they recorded a track to promote the film; I'd love to find it on the internet.

Towards the end of the movie, look for a really nice surprise appearance from veteran actor Joseph Campanella, which brought me to tears, as it reminded me of my own grandfather.

""The Dukes"" is what some might call a 'sleeper'. I will be ordering a copy for my family and perhaps a few more for relatives and friends.",1269907200,6,665,4.571428571428571

8390560,3,B0037FFB8Q,"It's a fine, easy-going movie, but I was hoping to hear the group sing more than only one song. The lead has one of the most beautiful voices known to mankind (very ""Bocelli-esque""... Check out ""Wise Guy""), and it was a disappointment not to hear more of him. Entertaining movie, though....",1513123200,,290,4.705882352941177
8390561,4,B0037FFB8Q,"Great feel good movie with some great acting. I was lucky enough to have met Robert Davi in person at an appreciation night put on by Congressman Thaddeus McCotter some years ago. Mr. Davi brought this film to a theater in Farmington Hills, MI and met with us before and after the movie.",1495238400,,287,4.433962264150943

8390567,3,B0037FFB8Q,"When I start the film, it begins with Robert Davi telling us he directed this film in case we missed it in the credits. The Dukes were the top do-wop group in 1963. It is filmed in 2007, but they don't look over 60, and Danny (Robert Davi) has a 38 year old ex-wife. Try not to think too hard. The group is broke, can't get gigs and work at a restaurant for Aunt Vee (Miriam Margolyes). George (Chazz Palminteri) likes full figured women. The group decides they are going to rob a dental co-op of 35 pounds of low grade gold.

The film was never funny. It had humorous moments. There wasn't enough drama to be a drama, or thriller to be a thriller. It was hardly a crime movie. It lacked the cleverness of classic indie. Now having said all that, it wasn't a bad film, it just didn't feel entertained in any way after I saw it.

No f-bombs, no nudity, implied sex.",1336435200,,864,4.198795180722891
8390568,5,B0037FFB8Q,"This is a great movie for Doo-Wop fans. It has all the elements. It is funny,has great music,is heartwarming and has a few twists to the plot. Chaz shines in his role and has a great supporting cast. All in all I think everyone will enjoy this film.",1323734400,,249,4.208333333333333
