The television I feel, is ""artificial life"" as it holds every aspect of humanity ( ie..drama, passion, love, loss, sorrow, grief, lust etc, etc). In regards to Britian and the US being the two horns, it makes sense. Especially since the founding father of America ( George Washington ) stated that; "" it is my hope, the future generations of this great nation would never have relations with  Britian and learn from the mistakes of their forefathers, and refrain from any dealings with the Roman Catholic church"".  The points that Ken made caused me to ponder things I haven't pondered before. I knew that the beast wasn't a man but a system, I did know about the UPC code  utilizing binary but did not know the start, pause, & stop brackets represent in binary the number 6. I work within the technology field and am very familar with binary and the use of UPC bar codes. He is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!! They really did utilize the number 6 three times for the start, pause, and stop brackets for the upc codes. I'm blown away by this.....",1467849600,,1148,4.478468899521531

Taking the point of view these are technological achievements. When everything regarding the Tribulation is supernatural, which is the point.

It should be right up your alley if you like Alex Jones style conspiracy.  There's no preachy message.  As far as the negative reviews go, I don't understand why it's ok that Alex Jones and other ""conspiracy"" style personalities can talk about this, but if a Christian does it, it's considered propaganda and garbage?  The Christian aspect is there, but I find it quite minimal and not TBN invasive at all.  Reviews for subjective material such as this, music and the like are very hard to relate to, but if you're a Prime member, it costs nothing.  Try it for 10-15 minutes.

In regards to Britian and the US being the two horns, it makes sense. Especially since the founding father of America ( George Washington ) stated that; "" it is my hope, the future generations of this great nation would never have relations with  Britian and learn from the mistakes of their forefathers, and refrain from any dealings with the Roman Catholic church"".  The points that Ken made caused me to ponder things I haven't pondered before. I knew that the beast wasn't a man but a system, I did know about the UPC code  utilizing binary but did not know the start, pause, & stop brackets represent in binary the number 6.

The most disturbing and exciting thing is that his research and findings make sense, and making sense of Revelation is a puzzle that many do not solve. The beast, false prophet or second beast are unmasked. Anyone who has a problem with the TV being the image of the beast only has to turn it on to the networks and look at the content to realize that he speaks the truth. My only concern is my understanding of the New Heaven coming to Earth. I don't think we can populate the vast and numerous galaxies if God is making his home with men on earth.

8236560,5,B00102F5Y8,"I found it quite insightful. After years of studying prophecy and the New World Order/Illuminatti/etc connections what he says makes perfect spiritual and intellectual sense. I care not whether all complies to my thinking in all ways and am only interested in God's truth and revealed knowedge/revelation not my whether truth is convenient or not. Hey, traditions can be wonderful or horrible. Jesus said that the traditions of man make the Word of God of no avail/fruitless. Such can appeal to our carnal wishes and have nothing to do with truth. Look at what believing lies and following wrong paths has done to the world and our great country. We have more political leaders calling evil good and good evil than ever. The founding fathers would kick them all these out as traitors.

If we are so dead set in our minds that we can not be taught and appreciate others in the Body of Christ/Church and let God run His Church vs man then we are hell bent on our own destruction. God sets people free and error binds us up and leads to chaos. Just because we have those who lust for power, control, and money and want to rule the world who are in total submission to their god Lucifer/Satan and have most of the world captive does not mean that God's Church of TRUE Christian followers is weak. Soon this is going to play out just as Revelation says. Personally, I hope to be like the virgins that were prepared to meet their groom - symbolic of the glorious believing true Church ready to meet Jesus in the air and be with Jesus than to be down here fighting the man of perdition and all the evil that will destroy so many lives. Fear of the fool, man of perdition, no. Would you rather be with your bride/or groom loving mate or in the middle of a battle?? Jesus did not just rattle His tongue and everything He said would be would be.

There are two events coming where Jesus is involved- gathering His saints,brides symbolically, who are ready for their Groom and when He comes to place His feet on earth again and take dominion from Satan/Lucifer and the evil ones trying to control the whole world and take souls away from God for himself - in defiance of God and hate for mankind whom God made in His Image.
