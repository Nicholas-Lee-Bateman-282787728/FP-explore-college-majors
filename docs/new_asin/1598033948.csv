7799914,4,1598033948,"Ive only watched the first few lessons, but I have a good sense of what this lecture series as a whole will be like. The presenters speech is very stilted; like an exaggerated William Shatner. Ironically, that seems to help me stay attentive. With the amount of challenging material in this lecture series, a monotone speaker would have put me to sleep very quickly.

I glanced at the course guidebook, which appears to just be an outline of the lecture. Its not something I will read, but some people may find it useful for revisiting the topics covered to help reinforce the information learned.

This series is great if you are looking for a challenging topic. Sure, the science has advanced since this was produced, but a lot of the information is still relevant when you want to learn the basics.",1515974400,,801,4.673758865248227

7799916,3,1598033948,"Sadava seems knowledgable enough, but his lecture style ( always looking at notes, nervously gripping the lecturn) is a bit sophomoric. More to the point is that this is a 2008 lecture series in a rapidly growing field, and the lectures are dated. Even more so for  Stephen Nowicki's great course offering ""the Biology of Life"" ( 2004). These great Course offerings in the field of genetics need need serious updating. Suggestions are to include Jennifer Doudna's pioneering work on CRISPR, and  recent advances in the field of Epigentics. These areas show how Biochemistry is broadly increasing our understanding and execution of gene editing in the case of CRISPR , and unraveling the role of ""junk DNA"" in gene management in the case of Epigenetics.",1513036800,2,752,5.008
