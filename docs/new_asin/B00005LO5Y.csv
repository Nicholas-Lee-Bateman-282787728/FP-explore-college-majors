8140070,4,B00005LO5Y,"This event had some good fights in it.  The Mezger/Otsuka rematch wasn't the barnburner I expected but the rest of the matches made up for it.  The novelty of seeing everyone slipping and sliding while fighting is worth the price of this DVD.  The undercard fights on this tape are really what make it a good buy.  The other big name fight on this DVD, the Ricco Rodriguez fight, wasn't that exciting either.
If you're a serious MMA fan, you'll definitely want this in your collection.  Order it.",997920000,2,496,4.590909090909091
