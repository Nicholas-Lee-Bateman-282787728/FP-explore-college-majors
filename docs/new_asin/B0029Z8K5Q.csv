3882402,1,B0029Z8K5Q,The DVD will play for five minutes and then stop playing. I had to advance the DVD to get it to play again for another five minutes. Then it will stop playing and I advance it again. Then over and over I had to repeat this in order to play the DVD.,1361750400,,248,3.7884615384615383

3882404,1,B0029Z8K5Q,"This movie was utterly ridiculous. I saw it because I like Ving Rhames, and it was filmed in Pittsburgh, where I went to school. While it shows a lot of good shots of the city, this movie was so bad.
It made absolutely no sense. There were drugs and prostitution, random guns, but there was no plot. The characters were all throw-aways, with no redeeming qualities to make me like any of them. Ultimately, the ending flat out sucked. It was confusing and had no basis to occur.",1305936000,,477,4.431818181818182
3882405,3,B0029Z8K5Q,"Four young 20-something men from the rough Upper North Side of Pittsburgh. They are stuck in dead-end jobs and struggle with dysfunctional family lives. The guys, inspired by the images of pop culture and the desire to break away from the neighborhood, regularly scheme to make extra money by running minor underground activities, including: sports booking, poker tournaments and house parties. One night during an evening out the four young men stumble across the ""new neighbors"", two independent prostitutes, Jasper and Candice, who end up inspiring a new business idea. Trapped in her own existence, Jasper, agrees to join forces with the young men to create, quite accidentally, what turns out to be an empire that launches each of them into financial riches. Along the way each character battles their own demons regarding the choices they have made In the end, however, their world comes crashing down on them in grandiose fashion. It's the city of bridges, where water separates the haves and have-nots, the bridge they sought so desperately to cross ultimately ends up being The Bridge To Nowhere. This isn't a bad movie but it is often a very silly one. Give it points for trying to be more than a typical exploitation movie. At the same time its hard not to take points away for it not hitting the mark. But at the same time the various bits of the movie does not mesh and you're left with disappointment at the movie not being better. Worth a rental.",1268956800,2,1461,4.824701195219124

3882408,4,B0029Z8K5Q,"Bridge to Nowhere is a well written story by Chris Guitierrez and directed by Blair Underwood.  The main characters are played by Ving Rhames, Bijou Phillips, Danny Masterson, Ben Crowley, and Daniel London.  Ving Rhames steals the show as he usually does in most of his movies.

Four childhood friends who grew up poor in Pittsburgh come up with a get rich hustle.  They want to be pimps in a unique sense.  Their operation runs like a call girl business.  They not only want to sell sex, but crack too.  They start with two girls who really show them how the business should go.  It made me wonder why did they need the guys, they could have functioned without the guys pimping them.  Then enters Ving Rhames' character who is the drug supplier.  All is well until one of the girls is murdered.  As usual among criminals, when the heat is on, things start to fall apart and the weakest link spills the beans.  Friends turn on friends and it becomes business - not personal.

The action and drama that unfolds after the murder makes for a great movie.  If you enjoyed this, you will enjoy similar movies:

3882409,3,B0029Z8K5Q,"Another Pittsburgh film straight to DVD, but at least it has been nice seeing some geography make the films of late for that city. Ving Rhames costars, along with one of the guys from That 70s Show, and one of the guys from American Pie, all making up this young cast wading through the Pittsburgh world of drugs, prostitution and getting rich quick.

The story is standard fare: four friends getting nowhere decide to become pimps, drug dealers and Scarface wannabes. Plenty of homages to other films here, but as stated we get some decent footage of a few Pittsburgh suburbs. The acting is fine but definitely overdone at times, even for the smaller Ving Rhames parts as he utilizes his nose spray and q-tips a bit too much. When the guys get their first bling it gets silly, and the amount of narration into how the drug trade works almost becomes a docudrama instead of a film. The film quality is above average throughout, and the 5.1 sound was adequate. The American Pie guy has a few minutes in the beginning and end, Ving has 15 minutes total of playing their main dealer and supplier, so the lion share falls upon Ben Crowley who gets his first leading role here.

No supplements at all, so the 3 stars are all for the film and DVD quality. Not a bad film but not great either, will be worth the time for locale followers and maybe some fans of Bijou Phillips (plays one of the pros).",1250467200,3,1393,4.458823529411765
8358630,5,B0029Z8K5Q,"Great movie! With my favorite actor Ving Rhames and filmed in Pittsburgh what more can you expect.
The acting was solid, plot constantly developing and a exciting ending!

I switched to a fire stick and I no longer have Vudu nor a DVD player. So this is the third time I bought it.
Well worth the price of admission!",1477008000,,316,4.3559322033898304

8358633,4,B0029Z8K5Q,"This is a pretty good movie about these losers that get a brainstorm to pimp these 2 girls that show up one night at their local watering hole.
Ving Rhames plays a drug distributor and has a scene where he's disguising his voice on the phone trying to sound like a 13 year old girl,
(I laughed my a.. off). The city of Pittsburgh deserves a co-star credit fantastic street and neighborhood spots, (especially the Brighton section).
3 stars for the movie, 5 stars for the Pittsburgh locales.",1428451200,,490,4.579545454545454

8358639,4,B0029Z8K5Q,"AT times, it seems like the show was glamorizing drugs and prostitution
But in the end, greed took a heavy toll on the 4 guys who decided to become pimps (and made 7.3 million in one year but lost it all)

The generally successful attempts at making this show real were marred by the typical Hollywood treatment - dramatic music at the end and the distant wailing of sirens and cop-car radio despatch when the action was all over",1362960000,,429,4.430379746835443
