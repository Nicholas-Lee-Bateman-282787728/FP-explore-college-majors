8234891,4,B000Z63Z7E,"It's hard to call Turkey Shoot a good movie. Entertaining and weirdly ambitious is probably the best way to put it but as far as I'm concerned those are two components to a good movie in general. It's an interesting watch.

They hired maybe the least charismatic leads they could go with. Railsback is not a bad actor at all. He's just not someone that you immediately latch onto as a savior from a dystopian death camp. Olivia Hussey here also looks like she's done a lot of living. I'm sure they hired her in hopes you remembered her at 15 in Romeo and Juliette but clearly this is more than a few years later and she's done some living. It's not so much that the little boys in the audience aren't going to want to save her as much as I had a super hard time not believing she wasn't a fully grown woman who'd done some living instead of the pure as snow youngin that was overwhelmed by evil rich people. The villains are all pretty well cast and hilarious which makes up for the leads. They at least seem like they could menace them.

The low budget is obvious but it's fun. The terrifying dune buggey of death being a good example. The sets look like a good wind could take them out. Even with all that though, they manage to still wrangle some audience investment into the thing. Pure force of will situation. It's pretty hard too considering the script is comically preachy but doesn't have anything to really say, which is always the hallmark of exploitation films.

I'd recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys B-films with a bit more ambition or people who really like John Carpenter films.",1453852800,,1600,4.4353741496598635
8234892,5,B000Z63Z7E,"Turkey Shoot AKA Escape 2000 and Blood Camp Thatcher is a fun and entertaining movie. Presented on Blu-ray from Severin films totally uncut and in HD for the very first time, its clearly a visual and audio treat for fans of this film. Turkey Shoot courtesy of Severin films was released Sept 8/15, it runs 93 minutes long and its a region free Blu-ray. I had no problems with playback on my region 1 player.

Sometime in the future set in a totalitarian society, defiant citizens are rounded up and categorized as deviants. Those labelled as such are interned in sadistic and barbaric behaviour modification camps ruled by tyrants. Welcome to camp Thatcher named after its leader. The rules of the camp are very simple, obedience to its leader and the state are mandatory. The camp has just received three new deviants in need of behaviour modification and their life is about to get very difficult. Theyre about to be introduced to the depraved, sadistic and brutal world of camp Thatcher.

Its clear after the three new prisoners enter the camp that they are there for more than behaviour modification. Warden Thatcher makes an offer to the new prisoners that if they agree to be hunted by him and his sadistic friends they will win their freedom and return to society for good. Exploding heads, savage beatings, graphic torture and Olivia Husseys naked breasts. What more could you ask for. Let the Turkey Shoot begin!

Video quality: 4.5/5

Severin films has to be commended for their efforts in bringing fans this film on Blu-ray. The new1080p transfer in 2.35:1 from the original vault negative has been fully restored. There is very little in way of print damage that I could see. The image is crisp and clear and the colors really pop, especially the yellow jumps suits worn by the prisoners in camp Thatcher. The level of grain seems natural looking and picture contrast is pretty consistent throughout. I couldn't believe how good this Blu-ray looked.

Sound quality: 3.5/5

Turkey Shoot offers a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mono track as the only sound option which was a little disappointing in my opinion. Dont get me wrong, the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack does a decent job where the film's dialogue, effects and musical score are concerned but it could have been so much better with a DTS-HD Master 5.1 track. The film also contains a rather quirky music score courtesy of Brian May guitarist for Queen.

Seems like every time I turn around, the fine folks at Severin Films and CAV Distribution are releasing even more obscure and excellent titles, many of which Ive never even heard of.  As an avid movie fan, I am chagrinned to admit there are titles out there with which Im not familiar, but I also find it fascinating as well.  Its amazing just how many are out there.  Todays title, TURKEY SHOOT (also known as ESCAPE 2000 and BLOOD CAMP THATCHER) is one of these long-lost classics.  And although its dated, its a lot of fun nonetheless.

The concept of this film is not new, however it is one of my favorite overarching storylines in fiction or films.  I love the idea of someone hunting human beings because man is intelligent and resourceful, therefore he makes the perfect prey to try and bag.

TURKEY SHOOT is shot well for the most part (as I said, its dated, so the camerawork is nothing amazing), but it looks good onscreen.  If you take into consideration the time period in which it was made, the production value looks high and makes this look like a bigger budget film (IMDB estimates the budget was 3.2 million, certainly nothing to sneeze it for back in the day).

The acting is pretty decent, with Steve Railsback and Olivia Hussey in the lead roles.  Railsback is just about a genre icon, starring in many memorable films that include LIFEFORCE and ED GEIN.  Hussey is probably best known for her stunning portrayal of Juliet in Franco Zeffirellis ROMEO AND JULIET, however she is well known in genre circles as well for starring in films such as 1974s BLACK CHRISTMAS, Stephen Kings IT, and the cult classic ICE CREAM MAN.  The rest of the cast is somewhat memorable, although the only standout performance is given by Michael Craig as the prison warden, Thatcher.

The special effects in TURKEY SHOOT  are surprisingly very well done, particularly the gore.  Some of my favorite scenes include a man getting both hands chopped off with a machete and a woman whose head explodes when she is stabbed in the face with an explosive-tipped arrow.

The storyline is nothing new, but it is executed well and holds the viewers interest.  When all hell breaks lose in the camp towards the end, a full-fledged battle breaks out between the prisoners and the guards.  This battle sequence is intense and fun, a great note on which to end the film.

TURKEY SHOOT is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Labeled as a classic from the Ozploitation (Australian exploitation) genre, this is a film you won't soon forget after its over.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1448236800,,2667,4.6059322033898304
8234894,4,B000Z63Z7E,"A surprisingly strong cast gives it their all in this futuristic exploitation thriller.  If you like action films with a touch of madness, you will enjoy this one, and it comes with a nice selection of extras as well  Here is a more in-depth story I wrote about it:

8234895,4,B000Z63Z7E,"Daft, but enjoyable. Its a movie that is a product of its time, & does not hold up well, like Dystopian Aussie action-er 'Mad Max'. Steve Railsback is a rather un-engaging lead, with some pretty wooden characterizations among the cast.
However, that said, its a bit of a hoot for what was a straight to VHS movie, I remembered  during the eighties. Turn off the brain, crack open a few tinnies, & prepare to laugh like a drain.",1447977600,,427,4.4743589743589745
