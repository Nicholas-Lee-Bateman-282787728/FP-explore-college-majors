Woman X mates with Piranha-Man and has a daughter who becomes a tv reporter. Then, Woman X mates with a werewolf [Piranha-Man wasn't enough?!] and has a son, Werewolf-Man. Exit Woman X leaving Piranha-Man, Werewolf-Man [werewolf/human] and Reporter-Woman [piranha-man/human].
The city of Dullsville, where they all live, is suddenly stricken with horrific murders. Our heroine, Reporter-Woman, investigates. The movie bounces around between live-action, hallucinations and dream sequences attempting to reveal a convoluted story line. This movie needs subtitles to tell the viewer what's happening.

It can't decide if it's a serious attempt at horror or a parody. On one hand, it tries to tell a scary story in a sophisticated mix of methods and then cuts to a scene with a model plane dangled on a string. They could've used stock footage of a plane flying and been better off.

Reporter-Woman and Werewolf-Man are romantically entangled. Hmmm.. Aren't they...? What kinda baby would that be; a fish in a fur coat?
Well, somewhere near the end,  Piranha-Man and Werewolf-Man engage in a lackluster battle. I'm not sure why. There's no reason given for them to be adversaries.

The killings begin at the start of the movie. On what have these monsters been feeding for 30 years? The killings are labeled the Baby Doll [I think] murders; an allusion to Barbie, as the victims are initially, young blonde females. Reporter-Woman is also a young blonde, leading the viewer to anticipate her being targeted. But the movie shifts away from a reporter uncovering a serial killer to one of a woman discovering her roots.

Bit of a twist at the end; a small bit.",1529539200,,1828,4.957516339869281
8529535,1,B008POPR74,"The film starts off as if it was going to be an interesting camp film with rubber masks and planes on a string and then fizzles. Lexi Glass (Carrie Long) is a reporter working on a story of a blonde serial killer who sounds like a wolf. The plot gets twisty, but in a dumb way which makes you want to turn the whole thing off. BTW we are rooting for the Piranha-Man because...

8529537,1,B008POPR74,"Even though this is a really low budget film with obvious costumed monsters and screams cheese-fest the movie could have been so much more  could have but didnt. The story was actually a pretty cool concept that has moments when everything seems to be going right. Yet the film takes a dramatically outlandish turn with strange direction and plot twists that just manage to complicate and frustrate the simplicity of the films storyline. There were clever moments of humor and well crafted death scenes that mask the low level of special effects used and the obvious use of rubber masks and costume monsters. It could have been a perfectly cheesy, yet entertaining flick. Unfortunately half way through the film it takes a wrong turn into complete absurdity, filled with over thought character details and plot twists. Not to mention the whole mystical dream guide sequence that just (even for a film called Piranha-Man VS Werewolf-Man) seems a bit asinine. I didn't expect much going into this film, but the initial acting and story seemed tacky yet acceptable. I almost began to enjoy the low budget feel of the whole thing until it hit that deeper dramatic, and pointless part with unnecessary backstory that fell flat.",1433462400,2,1222,4.9609756097560975

8529539,2,B008POPR74,"Silly,Very silly film about two unlike species of hybrid creatures fighting each other over a human woman.

Have to believe there some tongues in cheeks during the making of this non-epic.

There is some lovely victims of the female stereotypes, In varying stages of undress and shapes and sizes,hair color and height.

So,GET very drunk and have faint memories of all the PIRANHA movies you love and all the WEREWOLF movies you consumed and realize this isn't one of those,But try to enjoy anyway.
