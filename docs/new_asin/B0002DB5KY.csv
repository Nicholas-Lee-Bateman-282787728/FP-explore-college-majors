8026745,3,B0002DB5KY,"Xzibit and Busta Ryhmes star in this gritty action/drama film about a group of soldiers who aim to fight corruption in a small  Alabama town. Joshua pope returns to town to bury his father and settle his affairs. Upon his arrival, he discovers that the town has fallen victim to a corrupt police force that has a frightening grip of fear over the citizens. No one stays in business long unless the local sheriff gets a piece of the action.

Duncan then brings in his army of former soldiers and they get to work. However, down the line, the tides turn and all hell breaks loose.

While this film is ""different"" , not only with the story but production that was done on a shoestring budget, the cast of characters, which also includes Tiny Lister, Bubba Smith and Shakara Ledard helps to save the film and at least keep it watchable.

I feel if more was invested in the production and refinement of the story, it could have definitely been a great film.

I will say the cover of the DVD gives one the impression that it will be packed with non-stop action, which is not the case. If you are looking for a ""Boyz in the Hood"" or ""Menace to Society"" type film, then this is not for you.",1204502400,,1182,4.3545454545454545
8026746,4,B0002DB5KY,I really like this movie it is full of action I was a little disappointed with the ending but it will remain on of my favorite movies,1198195200,,133,3.962962962962963
8026747,5,B0002DB5KY,"This film is a remake of the earlier ""Bucktown"" starring Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, Thalmus Rasulalla and Tony King, check out the original product and compare it to this film, also, the soundtrack to ""Full Clip"" is banging, closing credits with John Legend singing ""She don't have to know"" is killer. With that being said, it's still ""Bucktown"" and I give it 5 stars because it paid homage to the old school flicks, while maintaining current flavor.",1154995200,,451,4.87012987012987
8026748,2,B0002DB5KY,"Rappers Busta Rhymes and Xzibit play former soliders who join forces once again to take down corrupt cops in a small town. This low-budget ""hip-hop Western"" also features Spliff Starr, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Bubba Smith, Prodigy of Mobb Deep, and Wyclef Jean as the narrator. Busta and Xzibit do a decent job with their acting but the dollar store production value, comic book style of storytelling, and lack of any veteran acting talent keep ""Full Clip"" from being anything more than another cheap straight-to-video rap star vehicle.",1105833600,3,532,5.126436781609195
8026749,1,B0002DB5KY,"""Full Clip"" is essentially an urban remake of the classic Western, ""Shane"", starring Busta Rhymes, Xzibit, and other Hip Hop performers. Obvious Question #1: Can you remake a classic Western with rappers and make it good? Yes.  Obvious Question #2: Did they do it here? No. Not even close.  ""Full Clip"" looks cheap, sounds cheap, and was cheap.  Having worked on this film, I know that the production company spent as little as possible to get this thing finished, with most of the money going to pay Busta and his posse.  (There are still several crew members who never got paid for their work on this film.) That sad note aside, ""Full Clip"" does have a few bright spots: Busta Rhymes creates a suitably viable anti-hero, while Xzibit impresses with his passion and believability.  Additionally, several of the supporting actors also gave watchable performances.  Other than that, ""Full Clip"" is a shoddy piece of film making that, despite the crew's best efforts, is simply not worth your time.",1096070400,5,996,4.898809523809524
8026750,3,B0002DB5KY,"I thought this film was a lot better than most films with a rapper as the main actor. From the cover this film seemed as if it was trying to appeal to Busta Rymes and Xzibit fan base more than anyone else, but they hold their roles good and the acting doesn't warrant most hip hop actors. It has a good story with elements of comedy sprinkled in to give this film in my rating 3/5. More dialouge and action would had made this film a real winner, but you can only get so much from actors whose main career is rapping.",1095033600,,517,4.078431372549019
