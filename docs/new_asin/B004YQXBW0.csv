8448746,5,B004YQXBW0,"This DVD, like its companions, is an excellent insight into Britains Royal Air Force from WWII through the Cold War. It combines excellent narrative from various experts and former pilots as well as archival footage relative to the subject matter. Occasionally, there is flying footage of actual restored RAF aircraft with commentary. Well worth the money.",1366761600,,356,5.375
