7823552,2,6302278872,Disappointing film considering the big name actors. Also historically and geographically innacurate. More like a home movie than a professionally produced film.,1350518400,,160,6.318181818181818
7823553,1,6302278872,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's a shame they were allowed to use the names Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.

The only performance with any merit was Claude Akins playing Teddy Roosevelt.  He was actually pretty darn good.

But Christopher Lee should stick to vampire movies.",1198886400,,296,4.634615384615385
