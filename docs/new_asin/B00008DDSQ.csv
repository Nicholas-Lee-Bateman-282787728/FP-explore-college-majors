1837314,5,B00008DDSQ,"This is an absolutely wonderful look into the lives of the ""original"" Three Tenors.  Some complaints that I have are that they don't have enough footage of the three tenors performing (especially Bjorling) and the sound quality of Gigli and Caruso is mediocre at best.  Nevertheless, this is a truly worthy tribute to these three great tenors  Highly recommended.",1073088000,13,363,5.11864406779661

7981889,5,B00008DDSQ,"My buddy JIM LOW, loves opera, Caruso, Bjoering, and Giigli. Now he has all three on one dvd. He loves them.  TOM",1399161600,,113,4.136363636363637
7981890,5,B00008DDSQ,"I saw this on the TV quite a few years ago. It's an insight into the lives of these three wonderful tenors. Although Caruso and Gigli didn't have access to modern recording studios, their voices were so beautiful it didn't seem to matter. Jussi Bjorling who's recording with Robert Merrill of the famous aria from The Pearl Fishers ""Au fond du temple saint"" is a joy to listen to.
  There is a lot if information about their lives, where they were born and died etc.  I don't think we will hear any better tenors than these three and that includes Pavarotti,Domingo etc.
Worth every cent.",1395187200,,588,4.580952380952381

7981892,5,B00008DDSQ,"This is an excellent DVD - actually a wonderful time capsule.

 Record companies are most anxious to profit by releasing new and highly publicized renditions of classic operas. There is nothing wrong about that - but in doing that the companies go to extremes to publicize the new casts, and often portray them as being the best ever.  This increases sales at the expense of the truth.  The truth is that there were more talented performers - much more talented.

 Here you find Caruso in his prime - and he was and is unmatched.  Here you find Gigli with his mellow, sweet tenor that floated so easily in the great opera centers of the world.

 And here your find Bjoerling - the best of the tenors from 1950 on - whose effortless singing made everything he did seem so easy.

 Genius shows up rarely - and these men were possessed of a gift that can only be called genius with their art.  We will not see their like again.

 But they can be seen and heard on this DVD and that is cause for rejoicing.  You can also see and hear Tetrazzini who as an aged woman still could summon beauty from her depths.  And she sings while seated.

 While few of us can say we saw any of them in person, those who did, have a priceless memory.  It is much like having seen Man O'War, Secretariat, Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig in person.  Few of us have been in the very presence of genius - and when we are so privileged we should never forget it.

 The narration is outstanding.  The photography is moving. The singers have had, and in all probability will have no peers, and the singing is - as the title says, ""Legendary"".

 If you love opera, you have a real need for this DVD.  Norris E. Gelman",1197763200,3,1680,4.287539936102236
7981893,5,B00008DDSQ,"This was a very informative and enjoyable biographical DVD on the three famous tenors from their humble beginnings to the end of their lives. The narrator waltzes you through with the tenor's enchanting voices along with the beautiful scenes of Italy including the quaint villages where each tenor had lived and how they became famous. It was quite interesting to know some things about them and how they looked at life in a big way.

If anyone is interested in opera and wants to know some history, this is a DVD to hold onto for your library collection. It was well done.",1168300800,8,573,4.617647058823529
7981894,3,B00008DDSQ,"The singing is great, the historical data is enlightening, but
there is just too much talking.  Only one or two arias are sung completely.  I would much rather hear exerpts from various operas where these three tenors performed.  I would give this DVD a new name.  Three Legendary Tenors, Lite.",1075939200,22,294,4.82
