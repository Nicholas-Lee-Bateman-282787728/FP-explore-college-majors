A relentless police officer decides the official truth hides something rotten and decides to go the core of the real facts.

Memorable film. A worthy to watch masterpiece. Don't miss it.

Another bitter denounce for all who still think in pregnant birds around the Communism!",1503705600,,512,4.666666666666667

The creepy parts are hyper creepy and provide a disturbing contrast to the idyllic laid back setting. I would have enjoyed subtitles for the Spanish language parts since I don't speak Spanish, but I got it anyway.
Watch this movie.",1438905600,,357,4.966666666666667
8565853,3,B00BC60M4U,"seems like it would be a good movie but i don't speak spanish and there are no subs for the spanish speaking parts, do not judge this movie by my review because it might be an excellent movie but my review is more of a complaint do to the fact there are no subs, if the spanish parts were small that would be one thing but there are entire conversations in spanish and if you just speak english like i do you will not understand the movie..",1380672000,,440,4.068965517241379
8565854,4,B00BC60M4U,"In the Shadow is a film you'd enjoy putting on without knowing very much about at all. I watched it without knowing anything about it, and I think that was to my benefit. The pacing was great, scenery & cinematography just lovely, and I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of character development that transpired considering the subject matter.

Honestly, I was left thinking about this movie after I had turned it off, which I think is genuinely rare. The subject matter is quite thrilling, but in the hands of other filmmakers, could have ended up being just another dumbed down, cheap thrill. It's a thought provoking movie with a solid performance by Jorge Sermini. Very moody, capturing some really cool moments & with some actual character/atmosphere about it... unlike a lot of debut films.

For someone looking to roll the dice on a smaller project or just a thriller in general - go for it.",1360972800,3,903,4.782051282051282
8565855,5,B00BC60M4U,"The genre of horror is one often overlooked by film buffs. Too often the horror film succumbs to cheesey formula, blood, and gore while a few airhead teen characters die in the process. This film takes the best of film's attributes, and the sensationalist visuals of horror, and places it in a story that is lyrical, explorative, and subtly questioning of important political issues of identity between North America and Puerto Rico.

Set on the Caribbean island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, the film catches the psychological terror one healer experiences as he acts against Mother Nature's wishes, and brings people back from near death, or death entirely. The cinematography goes from the minute to the magnified, closeups to expanse wide shots that span for hundreds of miles. The flow and presence of water as a crucial element of island living plays both a part in the ""real"" world of Diego, the lead character, but in his dreams about his young daughter, and during the terror he experiences when the Shadow, a dark character comes to act out a curse on him.

For a horror infused film, there is little blood, but the editing makes up for the same shock value. We glide along in a slow lyrical scene, only to be jolted by frame-by-frame jump cuts and frantic music that gives one a bit of a jolt.

The music, by composer Arles Estes, is textured and full of the film's deeper and poetic meaning and truly brings a new level of artistry to this unusual film. Danny Trejo gives a very interesting performance as a Hermit who passes on his ""talent"" of healing to Diego. Jorge Sermini, who also acts as producer, plays a strong and dark lead as Diego, and throws himself totally into this role. This is Nicole Elmer's debut feature film, and it's delightful to see a female director taking on a genre few women ever tackle.",1360886400,2,1822,4.6875
