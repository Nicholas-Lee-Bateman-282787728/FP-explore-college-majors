2733295,3,B000MGBSQC,"If you loved ""The Adventures Of Ozzie & Harriet"" as much as I did, you might want to give this set a look--but don't expect much.  The biggest disappointment is that most of the episodes are later ones when Ricky & David were grown up.  I believe that the best shows were the early episodes when the boys were children.  With the entire ""Ozzie & Harriet"" library to choose from, why did they include at least one episode that is in the public domain and available on DVD at the dollar store?  The commentary by David and Sam Nelson is poor and offers very little background.  There are some glitches in the digital transfer to DVD.  Generally speaking, the picture quality isn't much better than that found on the budget DVD's that are on the market.  If you enjoy Rick's musical numbers, you'll get a lot more (with excellent picture quality) on a dvd titled ""Ricky Nelson Sings"" (also available at Amazon).",1180656000,6,908,4.567901234567901
2733296,5,B000MGBSQC,The DVD's are great.  The only downside to this deal was that it turned out to be less expensive at WalMart.,1180051200,,108,4.142857142857143
2733297,4,B000MGBSQC,"I know many Ozzie and Harriet purist will argue with me over this but I think this is a great DVD set even if it is a little overpriced. But we have to remember first that the show is over 50 years old and the fact that an episodes from that era survived is a good thing. Secondly the seasons during that time were over 30 episodes long and alot of them(sadly to say) we'ren't that great and have no business on any DVD. This set contains  quality episodes with Ricky's Songs and even rare color episode which are never shown in syndication. I do realize a few of the songs and episodes have been cut for time and royalties reasons but most of the cuts aren't even noticeable and all you're really missing is a sponsor ad or two. If you really want all of the Ricky Nelson songs from the TV show but the ""Ricky Sings"" DVD also by Shout entertainment. So all in all a great product and a great set and let's face it Ozzie and Harriet fans this about the best we're going to get so we might as well take it was a coke and a smile and if not that at least a bowl of Tutti Frutti Ice Cream.",1179187200,10,1086,4.027777777777778
2733298,1,B000MGBSQC,"What a mess....truncated episodes...I can't believe we've waited all this time for the ""official"" release to get these chopped up episodes with the same syndication opening instead of the correct one per season/show.  That was the first clue that there was something wrong...the next one was that the classic Tutti Frutti episode wasn't as long as the bloody VHS available decades ago...they even cut Ricky's singing on that one...ridiculous.

Perhaps this is why Gunnar and Matthew and Tracy aren't involved?  A huge disappointment and from a company that normally does  better.  Still worth owning (at half the price) for what's there...but a shame to represent such a legendary series with such a half *@#sed production.",1178928000,69,723,5.252173913043478
2733299,5,B000MGBSQC,"Let me start by saying THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! to Shout and the Nelsons for releasing this wonderful collection of shows from the Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet. I have loved this show for years but have been stuck watching cheap public domain copies since the show never airs on TV in our area. When I first saw this collection for sale at Amazon I just figured it was going to be another cheap version and I passed it by. But while I was searching Amazon again one night I came upon this release again and this time I read the description. After learning it was going to be an authorized edition by the Nelson family I ordered it right away. My set arrived two days ago when bad news was coming at me from left to right and I was really feeling down in the dumps. When I was able to sit down and put in the first DVD all my troubles went away for a short time. The transfers are wonderful as is the sound. The only thing that disappointed me is that some of the songs have been deleted. I enjoyed Ricks song in the episode ""Tutti Frutti Ice Cream"" but it's been cut. However, this is very minor as far as I'm concerned. Fans of this wonderful collection will appreciate that fact that we finally have some crystal clear shows to watch. My only hope is that many more shows will be released very soon. Thank you again to Shout and the Nelson family for giving fans this wonderful collection. I highly recommend it to all who love Ozzie, Harriet, David and Ricky.",1178236800,13,1471,4.275985663082437
2733300,4,B000MGBSQC,"After numerous poor quality released public domain copies of Ozzie and Harriet we have an authorized release from Shout! Factory. The picture and sound quality are excellent!  Providing a compilation of episodes from all 14 years the show excelled in good family entertainment.  Ozzie and Harriet never really gave ""big belly laughs"" but good gentle chuckles and smiles.

The 4 DVD's in this compiliation provide some nice features including  ""The Story Of Ozzie and Harriet, plus home movies of David and Rick  on the trapeze.  At the time Rick was second only to Elvis and was ""Flying Through The Air With The Greatest Of Ease.""  I don't think you'll see Justin Timberlake doing that today. Also commentaries by David and Sam Nelson on selected episodes.

The reason for a Four Star and not a Five Star is simple.  Songs that Rick performed on several of these episodes have been eliminated.  We are getting the syndicated versions of the show.  Especially missing is ""My Bucket's Got A Hole In It"" (My favorite Rick Nelson song)from the ""Closed Circuit"" episode.

Goldmine magazine had it right in their current issue announcing this release.  When will we get a Two Hour DVD of Rick performing with James Burton from the show on DVD?",1178064000,24,1237,4.861244019138756
2733301,5,B000MGBSQC,"While I have all these episodes on VHS, I can't wait to see them on DVD with the optional commentaries. I do wish David had included a few more of the earlier episodes, but will take what I can get since till now you could only find the public domain copies on DVD. I wonder if the set will include A BROTHER REMEMBERS...David's tribute to his brother Rick.

The more I watch OZZIE and Harriet , the more I appreciate what a talent Ozzie was in keeping this all together. They were on radio and then on tv for FOURTEEN years!!!!! I love this show.",1175558400,11,547,4.20952380952381

I found it interesting to listen to David and Ricky's youngest son (Sam), talk about the shows (1 commentary per disc). I'm glad they took the time to do it and wish they would give further insight about the show and the family. As everybody probably knows Ricky went down the wrong road with his life but if any of us would have gained the fame and fortune that he had, it's hard to tell where we would be. At one point it's told that Ozzie didn't want either of them to get into showbiz (on the disc) and he was right. Ozzie sure exhibits qualities that I like and we all need to work at preserving and passing them along. Especially since Hollywood has gone the way of Ricky and not Ozzie. It's a hard swim against the tide I suppose, but I know it's worth it for myself and future generations. Sure wish I was as lucky as Sam to have spent an afternoon with Harriet watching the old shows. Yes, I'm a dreamer.",1283904000,3,1050,4.255

 If I had my way, I'd also include more of the episodes when Rick and Dave were younger. They are much funnier and better than when the boys were adults.

However, whatever the year the writiing in here was great and there were always plenty of laughs.  In fact, this might be the only TV sitcom I actually enjoyed the canned laughter - even that was good!

BOY WAS I WRONG! The shows represented here are transferred crisp and pristine. This has to be the greatest situation comedy series ever! It certainly ran the longest(14 years). I refuse to include the Simpsons as being a situation comedy series. It is an animated series and crap at that! That being said here in lies the brilliant work of Ozzie Nelson who for 14 years wrote the scripts, produced and directed the shows, and if that weren't enough stared in them! There's a reason why this show went 14 years. IT'S FUNNY! As a head comedy writer for a series I can tell you that the one liners and zingers here are second to none. Only Seinfeld can claim a better (no make that equal) amount of sure fire funnies per minute. And it doesn't stop there. We witness the birth of a Rock-a-billy giant in Ricky Nelson who grows up before our very eyes. Nothing vulgar, good clean fun, and sharp wit. This show had it all!

In any case, they don't provide what you'd hope as a viewer you want him to say and touch on.

The production quality is fine and not to be confused with some old-TV packages where the show is no easily viewed.

He was 3 years older than I, but in my fantasy world I was getting the same adulation that was coming his way.  Not too realistic for a chubby, pimply-faced kid like me.  There were other family shows on back then, like Father Knows Best and Leave it to Beaver, with the same kind of hokey plot lines as Ozzie & Harriet.  But the one thing the Nelsons had over the others was that although yes, they were acting, underneath it all they WERE a real family.  Kudos to the producers of this DVD set.  Watching David and Ricky grow up again was well worth the price of admission.  Thanks for a wonderful trip to yesteryear!",1181347200,4,724,4.188405797101449

2733549,5,B000MGBSQC,"The ""Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."" Even now - a full 41 years after the last episode aired on national television, people know at least a little something about the show.  Some see it as pure pabulum - an unattainable fantasy all-American family that never had problems that couldn't be solved in 30 minutes (including commercials!)  Others will say "" . . . that's the way it used to be in America - slow and easy - and kids respected their elders!""  While the rational people (like me and probably you) will say it was both of the above - plus something more.  To praise or blame this show for the success or failure of the generation that followed is akin to suggesting that all families were like the Brady's in the 1970's, the Cosby's in the 1980's, the Tanner's in the 1990's, or the family in ""7th Heaven"" of this decade.

What ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" represent is simple.  Entertainment.  That's it.  Were there lessons to be learned?  Sure.  Were times simpler ""back then?""  Maybe.  But how many people reading this held a potato sack race to settle an argument in the family after watching the Brady's doing it and successfully thwarting a problem while having mindless fun?  I'm betting not many.

Ozzie (Oswald), Harriet (Peggy), David, and Ricky (Eric) were characters on a television show that were also real people with problems just like the rest of us.  Sometimes a sitcom is just a sitcom.  I don't watch O&H to learn about what it was like to grow up in a big house in California or how it was to raise a family in the 1950's any more than I'd watch an episode of 7th Heaven to get advice on how to talk to my children today.  Just sit back and allow yourself to be a friend of the Nelson's.  What's the matter with that?  Simplistic?  Yep - but sometimes that's all you need.

Ozzie and Harriet Nelson did wonderful things for radio and television.  David became an actor and director separate from the O&H show.  He made a great film about his brother called ""Easy to be free"" . . . when are we going to see that on legitimate DVD Dave?  Rick became one of the giants of Rock & Roll.  He wasn't a founder - but he sure didn't miss it by much.  His music is a vibrant today as it was when he recorded it.  It's a shame he isn't given the recognition he deserves for being a founding father of the Southern Rock movement of the late 1960's.  The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and others get far more credit for what Rick really pioneered.  If you want to know more about Rick's music, you should buy his CD's released after 1963.  ""Garden Party,"" ""Rick sings Nelson,"" ""Windfall,"" and ""Rudy the fifth"" are a great place to start.

This television show remains the longest running sitcom of all time.  It aired for 14 years on television - racking up a total of 435 episodes.  The Simpsons have been on the air longer now, but are still 36 episodes shy of beating the O&H record.  Since O&H started on radio six years before television, a total of 22 years of the Nelson's lives were committed to tape or film.

I never saw a full episode of the show until my daughter bought me one of those ""dollar store"" DVD we're all familiar with.  It took me awhile to get around to watching it, but when I did I really loved most of the episodes - and all were entertaining.  With this ""official"" release we get to hear some of David's thoughts and recollections.  We hear Sam (Rick's youngest son) ask some pretty interesting questions and tell a good story or two.  The prints are very good compared to the junk we've all seen before this release.

There are disappointing aspects to this set as well.  There are only 24 episodes out of the 435 produced.  Some of the episodes are cut.  One song is missing from the ""Closed circuit TV"" show (I think this is due to copyright problems.""  The shows jump from Rick and David being little boys to married men in very short order.  But let's face it - this is a starter set.  I'm sure if sales have been strong, they'll consider re-releasing more episodes.  We can hope they'll put all 14 seasons out - uncut and complete with Rick's songs.  Will this happen?  Who knows?  I'm still waiting for the 3rd season of ""The Commish!""

On the plus side - some are episodes you cannot find on the budget DVDs.  The prints are very good and the sound is excellent.  I've read that Ozzie was a perfectionist and insisted on having the best cameramen, etc.  I'm guessing there are even better prints in existence, but perhaps it is cost prohibitive to restore all of the episodes for digital transfer.  Another plus are the extras you'll find.  Are they too short?  Well, for fans of Rick or Dave or the show, yes.  However, we didn't have these before this set.

PLEASE: David or whoever has the rights to these wonderful shows, will you consider giving the public every episode in chronological order?  It would be perfect if all of Rick's musical numbers could be included and the shows in their full, uncut glory.

What more can be said?  It was a great show.  It was not a time capsule of how America really was in the 1950's and 1960's; rather it was a place viewers could tune into to get away from their problems for a while.  It became an icon because so many people identified with situations or the characters they saw.  THEIR memories became one with the show.  You can still do that thanks to the Nelson estate and the miracle of film.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch ""The Shield"" to get away from my problems.  Vic is in much more trouble than I am . . . or is he?
