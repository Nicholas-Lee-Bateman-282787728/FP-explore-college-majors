3421437,5,B0018UZ3UI,"I have been waiting many years for this movie to be made in a DVD format. A little shown film noir, the story seems deceptively simple at first. But I love the way it evolves into one of the best noir movies if you are patient. And then there's the scene at the police headquarters which is still chilling each time I watch it!",1325548800,2,327,4.125

3421439,5,B0018UZ3UI,"William Lundigan had two of his finest ""B"" hours at RKO with Robert Wise's Mystery in Mexico, and the marvelous little film, Follow Me Quietly, directed by Richard O. Fleischer. All the flair and pacing of The Narrow Margin which were soon to give Fleischer his reputation are already in evidence in this terrific ""B"" mystery. Ideas tossed around by Anthony Mann and Francis Rosenwald were crafted by Lillie Hayward into a tightly written screenplay; nice touches of secondary conversations adding color and zip to the main action and plot. Lundigan today gets a bad wrap but in this fun mystery, perhaps even more so than in Mystery in Mexico, you can see it was only the material he was often given which held him back. He's solid and likable here, reminiscent of Alan Ladd.

Ann Gorman (Dorothy Patrick) braves the rain hoping to pop in the local police hangout and get the scoop on a strangler the cops can't seem to stop. Lundigan is Lt. Harry Grant, who wants no part of she or her tabloid rag, however. Catching the ""Judge"" as he has been named by the papers is his only priority. The Judge only kills on rainy nights, and it's been raining a lot lately. Grant's frustration comes to a head in this breezily paced mystery when he helplessly watches the editor of a local paper dictate his own final story after becoming the killer's seventh victim to date. There is some nice back and forth between Grant and Ann as she begins to grow on him. An excellent scene where it is Grant who undresses and readies himself for bed after Anne has finagled her way into his apartment is a nice reverse twist which and adds spark to the couple's pleasant romance.

With tons of evidence yet no real clues, Grant gets the idea of making a dummy with all the killer's characteristics except a face to aid police in their search. While it sounds corny, it is done quite well and Lillie Hayward's script has a dynamite scene of Grant talking to the life-size mannequin not to be missed. Ann's idea about a magazine dropped at the scene of the eighth victim puts Grant hot on the trail. There is an exciting chase where Grant nearly bites the dust punctuating the mystery, and a very pleasing wrap up for the continuing romance of Harry and Ann. William Lundigan and Dorothy Patrick work nicely together in this one, and Jeff Corey is solid as Lundigan's pal, Sgt. Collins. Marlo Dwyer contributes a nice turn also as a waitress who may have unknowingly served a killer.

Nicely photographed by Robert de Grasse, with an excellent screenplay from Lillie Hayward and fine direction from Fleischer, this is an enjoyable way to kill an hour on a Saturday afternoon or pass the time on a rainy night when you can't sleep. Great fun, and the kind of discovery which more than makes up for all the ""B"" films which didn't make the grade. This one gets ten stars where I'm concerned. Fans of the genre who pick this one up will be delighted. Highly recommended!",1312848000,9,2943,4.580645161290323
3421440,3,B0018UZ3UI,"Until I saw it listed in a French DVD catalog, I didn't even remember that ""Follow Me Quietly"" existed. Picking it up more out of completism because of its co-story credit for Anthony Mann (who may have directed some sequences) than out of hope, it turns out to be a highly enjoyable sleeper. True, it's little more than a highly disposable studio programmer, but it moves briskly along at just over an hour and is filled with memorable moments, be it a newspaper editor dictating the story of his own murder or a conversation with a dummy of a faceless serial killer that has a neat payoff that has no bearing on the rest of the film whatsoever beyond just being a good scene. There's some fun in the sparring between William Lundigan's cop and Dorothy Patrick's rookie reporter for a downmarket crime magazine that owes much to director Richard Fleischer's neat touch with dialogue that would be much better utilised on The Narrow Margin. Mann's signature is evident in the finale, prefiguring his beloved mountain/canyon shootouts by having the finale take place in a chemical factory's gantries and platforms.

Nothing special, but just the welcome sight of pros doing their job much better than anyone asked them to. For once the French title, Assassin Without a Face, seems a better fit than the American, the relevance of which only becomes apparent in the penultimate scene.",1210550400,8,1382,4.8559322033898304

8271228,5,B0018UZ3UI,"Whew, I LOVE this movie. Something about how the diverse elements combine to provide a strange viewing experience...but wait, I'm think-typing aloud and probably not making much sense...

File this under (at least) semi-Weird Noir. Clocking in at just under an hour (usually a minus but in this case a huge PLUS, as everything just cooks like a V-8 Engine barreling down a 1949 freeway), and wasting not one minute of it's time on your screen.

There's a serial killer loose, only they didn't call them that then, and he strikes only when it rains, so if you, like me, believe that when you just add rain-swept anything to Film Noir that you have frosting on your cake then you are in for a shadowy treat.

William Lundigan plays the aggravated Police presence, with the always-great Jeff Corey as his backup. Dorothy Patrick has been newly employed by a sleazy newspaper and needs the job, so she struggles with common decency while Lundigan brushes off her cheap tactics used to get any scoop possible on the murderer.

That's the bare bones of the plot with no spoilers and there is much more shading involved that I have purposely left out as this dark little film needs to be witnessed by those who need Film Noir with an indescribable craving in their gut and eye-translating brain.

It's not a masterpiece, but it does get pretty creepy in parts, plus there are a few moments of sly/slick/sick humor, all tied with the hard-boiled string that keeps it roughly bound together in the genre.

One last thought; the title threw me for a loop when I first heard it, as I felt it just didn't have much pulp-impact. I like it now that the movie has found it's way into my heart, but I'm mentioning this in the event that it might also hold anyone else back from checking this gem out (I had to wait for a friend-in-the-know to finally tell me to quit dragging my presumptive feet and just experience it for myself).",1517616000,,1915,4.584795321637427
8271229,5,B0018UZ3UI,I found this film great because it held my interest and very pleased to add this to my film noir collection.  It was interesting to see how this detective was able to hunt this killer to justice.  If you like good detective shows then this is one to add to your collection.,1482710400,,273,4.230769230769231
8271230,1,B0018UZ3UI,"This is one of the poorest movies I've seen in a long time.  The ""obsessed"" cop, urged by his police chief to make an arrest, comes up with the following: let's make a dummy of the killer (faceless) and show it to the police working the case. Hmm, says the chief, not a bad idea.  It was a preposterously lame idea, one which served absolutely NO procedural purpose whatsoever.  Enter the blonde tabloid writer who wants in on the case.  Ah, we think, I bet they use her paper to set a trap for the killer, a hackneyed but potentially interesting climax with her as bait in the trap.  No sir. She is a maguffin.  And when they chase down a guy they suspect (guess what, a waitress IDs the guy from looking at the dummy), and they have a big shootout scene amongst the refinery equipment in Wilmington, familiar to audiences from a really good noir, White Heat made the same year, we are just waiting for the celebrating cop and the reporter, to have the smiles leave their faces when still another murder occurs.  But no.  Credits.  Incredibly lame.  Should be mandatory watching in film schools across the land.  4 stars indeed!  I suspect no one will read this review after watching this turkey.",1441238400,,1197,4.4907407407407405
8271231,5,B0018UZ3UI,Let's get this straight right from the beginning: This is not film noir. What it is is an engrossing short murder mystery film (at 59 minutes)  about a cop on the heels of a notorious serial killer who kills only in darkness and rain. Don't expect buckets of blood or gore since this was made in 1949 by the great late director Richard Fleischer (SOYLENT GREEN) and moves at such a quick pace that the 59 minutes just fly by. And for those who refuse to buy Warner Archive Collection films because they are manufactured on DVD-R: You are missing out on some great films and missing the dearly directorial efforts of some great directors. The fact is that I have had more pressed DVDs fail on me than any DVD-Rs. Give this one a chance and I guarantee yo will be ordering more of Warner Archive films. They have some great early films just waiting to be discovered.,1423180800,,864,4.433962264150943
8271232,5,B0018UZ3UI,"This is what all good movies should be -- direct and to the point, with crisp dialogue.  The script by Lillie Hayward is perfect for the genre -- blunt, rugged, and moves right along.  Richard Fleischer's direction is excellent, in the same vein as his work on another excellent film, ""The Narrow Margin.""  Okay, the chief detective's hostility toward the woman magazine reporter is a bit overdone, especially given how attractive she is.  But everyone's on the trail of The Judge, a psycho who always strikes when it is raining.  A gem of the noir crime detection genre.",1412899200,,571,4.785714285714286
8271233,4,B0018UZ3UI,"Goes to show, you don't all the time require recognizable, bankable stars to enjoy a flick. Follow Me Quietly, a really interesting RKO police procedural from 1949, presents a pair of career supporting actors as its leads. Follow Me Quietly brings an extra helping of the shivery feels. The unknown big bad comes off genuinely creepy.

It's got a stumped homicide detective, Lt. Harry Grant (William Lundigan), bumping into one dead end after another in a (so far) six-month manhunt for an elusive serial killer what's styled himself ""The Judge."" Six months with nothing to show but for seven strangled victims and a few empty observations (ie: the murderer is over 6', has gray in his hair, the rain seems to trigger his homicidal urges). So far, these haven't been enough to go on.

Six months of being taunted by the Judge who exacerbates Lt. Grant's bedevilment by leaving imperious notes at the scene of the crime. One such: ""I have been ordained to destroy all evil. Beware! - The Judge."" It's not such a good time for nosy journalist Ann Gorman (Dorothy Patrick) to try to worm herself into an exclusive. Ann has got a deadline, though, even if it's for a sensation-seeking rag like Four Star Publications. Ann has a tough time getting into the Lieutenant's good graces. But she's awfully cute and incredibly dogged. And, gratifyingly, it's her insider knowledge of her lurid periodical that proves instrumental in Grant's finally closing the case. And it bears repeating: she's awfully cute. Patrick and Lundigan, two perennial lesser lights, have a grand chemistry.

The story, imbued with vitality and personality and psychological flourishes, was a treatment co-written by Anthony Mann before he was an acclaimed director. Except that it's a story that RKO had buried but later dug up when the similarly-themed He Walked by Night (1948) became a surprise critical darling. Like plenty of B-pictures, Follow Me Quietly is only an hour long, rendering it lean and fast-moving. Whoever staged the moody lighting deserves massive props as the masterful play of light and shadow helps to lend a sense of unease. Don't mistake this movie for a showy whodunit. No one arrives at genius leaps of logic. The deductions are reasoned out in practical fashion. Workmanlike methodology is championed. There's a lot of pounding the pavement and chasing random leads and canvasing the neighborhood. Ah, but there's that offbeat approach taken by Lt. Grant. His supreme lack of success at last compels him to employ a life-sized mannequin - designed with what few physical details have been gathered on the Judge - so as to jog the memories of both his flatfoots and witnesses. It's neat that, thru the course of the film, this dummy - dubbed ""Deadpan"" - becomes a supporting character in its own right. My favorite moment - because it's the creepiest moment - involves Grant in his office talking to the seated dummy as it gazed out the window and into the rain. It's one of the film's unexpected delights.",1412467200,3,3002,4.928853754940712
8271234,5,B0018UZ3UI,"Great crime film absolutely overcomes its modest budget, perfectly cast with engaging stars who work well together. Interesting to see the beginnings of modern crime techniques. One of the best of this genre in my opinion.",1411430400,,222,5.194444444444445
8271235,4,B0018UZ3UI,"FOLLOW ME QUIETLY is one of those RKO noirs that were made on a low-budget with two fine actors in B-films like William Lundigan and Dorothy Patrick.  It is quietly entertaining and has a happy ending but it was on the lower half of a double-bill undoubtedly.  Worth a look at from amazon.com.

8271236,5,B0018UZ3UI,"I love this 1949 film, which is more of a police procedural than a typical film noir. It's about the search for a psychopathic killer called The Judge. William Lundigan plays the detective on the trail of the killer. He's pestered throughout the film by a beautiful female journalist, who has been assigned by a tabloid to write the unfolding story of the serial killer. There's plenty of atmosphere, style and surprise in this little-known film. Very entertaining!",1355616000,,465,4.9743589743589745
