2444492,5,B000BX5X5I,What a beautiful movie!  I'm not a huge Hallmark movie fan but I watched this one b/c of the actors in it and I was so glad I did.  Like another person said I could watch this over and over and over.  It is so wonderful and great for the whole family.  If you have a hopeless romantic in your family BUY this for them.  I promise you they will love it!,1195948800,11,352,3.8333333333333335
2444493,5,B000BX5X5I,"I saw this movie at a (small) girls camp. Of course, we all fell deeply in love with Ray by the end of the movie.

This is not only a beautiful and unique love story, different from your typical Pride and Prejudice type romance (don't get me wrong--Pride and Prejudice is one of my absolute favorite stories of all time, this story is just different in a very good way) but there are many other lessons, not just those of ture love and happily ever after. Some of the lessons in this film might be: acceptance of others, acceptance of self, forgiveness, and (of course) that you don't have to be similar to a person to love them--you can love anyone, if you want to.

I'm not sure I would like to show this movie to very young children, although there is no bad language or suggestive scenes, etc. There are some things parents wouldn't want very young children to see or that they wouldn't understand, such as (*SPOILERS*) the Japanese Internment is discussed in some detail, Livvy is sent to live with Ray so she doesn't have a child out of wedlock, etc. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful and wholesome film, just watch it with older kids who would understand these kind of things.",1155600000,73,1187,4.440366972477064
2444494,5,B000BX5X5I,"This movie was great! The story was beautiful, and interesting--not cheesy or hokey, like the Love's Enduring Promise series. No cheesy lines at all, or fake loving gazes. The story is about an educated woman who finds herself pregnant and unwed during WWII. Her father arranges a marriage for her to someone she has never met, in a place she has never been. Skeet Ulrich--who I never really thought of as more than the cute guy from The Craft--was super moving as the husband who loves her from the very moment he lays eyes on her. He treats her like GOLD! Then there is a subplot involving friends from a Japanese internment camp--which really adds to the story. Check it out. Its a great movie!",1152921600,102,697,4.584
2444495,5,B000BX5X5I,"This has to be one of the most romantic movies i have ever seen other than pride and prejudice of course. This movie was wonderfully done and the clothes for that era was just breath taking wonderful vintage clothing.. But the movie was so good and the emotions seem real and the ending was just wow, both actors did a great job and the guy his character just made you want to fall in love with him yourself...if your that hopless romantic then this is for you...

ALSO RECOMMENDED FROM HALLMARK DVDs OR MOVIES: the series

Love comes softly

Love's enduring promise

Love's long journey

you have to watch and get those three you won't be disappointed...",1145232000,17,655,4.564102564102564
2444496,5,B000BX5X5I,"I watched this film at the suggestions of a friend...Had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since.  It's so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes.

Just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having.  Livvy, a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother.  The father of her baby leaves the scene and Livvy's father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of Colrado.  Ray (the farmer) is shy and reserved, but was brought up with high moral values and treats Livvy like she is something special.  The rest of the movie develops the story of how Ray and Livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love, even though that was not Livvy's original intention.

I think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance.  I have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!",1132444800,244,1168,4.576923076923077
2444497,5,B000BX5X5I,"Keri Russell is brilliant & Skeet Ulrich, well, he's the perfect ""Ray"" & I can't imagine anyone else in these starring roles.  The entire cast was wonderful.  Highly recommend!",1522972800,,176,5.0344827586206895

2444525,5,B000BX5X5I,"My favorite Hallmark Movie based on the book by author Ann Howard Creel. The story takes place during World War II and is about two people who have never met who are immediately thrown together via an ""arranged marriage"" by the minister's of the two people's respective churches.  She is an intellectual college graduate from Denver who has made a terrible mistake, and he is a quiet gentle farmer from a rural Colorado outpost. The story teaches us about the power of kindness, forgiveness, self-acceptance and how these simple attributes can transform one's life forever.",1506643200,,573,5.031578947368421
2444526,5,B000BX5X5I,"Wow. This is a really well made movie. The actors are fantastic and the cinematography is impressive (don't judge it by the opening scene). The main characters actually worked together on Into the West but played cousins if my memory serves me right. The movie reminds me of Sarah Plain and Tall or Love Comes Softly, but i like The Magic of Ordinary Things better. It also includes history, taking place in World War II, and i liked the education it offered.
Definitely one of the BEST Hallmarks I've ever seen. And I'm super picky. :^D",1506297600,,537,4.604166666666667

2444532,5,B000BX5X5I,"It's a gentle story, one of self-realization and growth under extraordinary circumstances. The story takes place around WW2. A college-educated woman from a well-to-do family becomes pregnant by a soldier who then deserts her. Arrangements are made so that she is sent to a farm community where she marries a complete stranger, a farmer who has little education but a heart and a capacity to love such as she has never known before. She is embraced by his family and the entire community, where she learns what love is really all about - acceptance of who a person is and not only accept their differences but to embrace them. By the time the baby is born there is no doubt that the right choice was made by everyone.",1503792000,,717,4.609375

So much so that I bought it so I could watch it again. It's sweet, a bit sappy, predictable, and pretty much everything I don't look for in a movie. Keri Russell played her part well but I honestly think it was Skeet Ulrich's performance that won me over. He was perfect as Ray.

Lyrical, well-paced and magical. This movie is about forgiveness. Simple self realization and acceptance. Just a WONDERFUL movie that I would recommend. Keri Russell is so perfect in this role and Skeet Ulrich had the performance of a lifetime. His character was so calm and patient, and he understood her from the moment he saw her.

The sweet things her new husband does to win her over are just charming.  They both have emotional wounds to heal, and they find that healing in their blossoming relationship.  Their different backgrounds are replaced by an appreciation for the things that make each of them unique.  Each of them stretch out of their comfort zone to embrace and appreciate the interests of the other.",1449014400,3,656,4.769911504424779

2444732,5,B000BX5X5I,"I  am an English Literature teacher and usually find all Hallmark movies irritatingly formulaic; however, this one is very different. I had never even heard of Skeet Ulrich,who plays the innocent farmer husband, but he was perfect for this part. Very few actors can convey an authentic sense of personal sincerity and goodness with a glance, but he manages to do just that in this movie, and Keri Russell is excellent throughout as her initially skeptical stares at Ray transform into longingly appreciative/loving looks at this gentle and genuinely good man she has married.  It is a fanatastic love story, and I intend use this movie in my class to show what is not said or done in a movie is often far more romantic than the in- your- face sex of so many of today's movies. This movie shows love with a side of WWII historical fiction. It has so many of the literary elements that are difficult to teach encompassed in a refreshingly pure story with an understated plot and a universal theme: to appreciate the magic in ordinary days.",1402963200,5,1037,4.6923076923076925

I read a TV Guide critics review that said the two leads were badly miscast but I couldn't disagree more.  They were perfect.  Ive always like Keri Russell and as for Skeet Ulrich - OMG!

She maintains hopes that the father of her baby, who appears to be an uncaring fool, will somehow acknowledge and return to her.  She gradually discovers the character of the man she has married is far superior to the one she thought she wanted.

Well written screenplay and superb acting, especially by Keri Russell.  One can see an attraction between the woman and her new husband that takes time to materialize.  A moving and compelling story.",1396137600,,779,4.725925925925926

This film does a wonderful job of conveying the spirit of the book, and I felt the few liberties that were taken were beneficial, rather than distracting.  Perhaps it is my affinity for happy endings that causes this preference, but with that said, the ending was not soppy, nor did it defy all logic, as some more ""fluffy"" Hallmark movies are known to do.

2444747,5,B000BX5X5I,"a few minor flaws.  The story, the setting, the photography, the direction, and the acting deserve the appreciation others have expressed so warmly.

[SPOILER]  Few may agree with this, but I feel that ""Walter"" is not integral to what the story is about.  His story does make some important contributions, but there must be a better way to bring things to a head and show that Livy has fully accepted her new life and is able to pass on what she has learned.

On balance, the movie is better (as a movie) than the novel is (as a novel).

By the way, there are still people around who demonstrate lifelong love and deep personal integrity.  I live with some of them :)

2444750,5,B000BX5X5I,"Hollyweird does not get what is really sexy. It is not ripping and pawing at each other, girl on girl or drinking blood. It is unconditional love, patience, forgiveness. Ray Singleton agrees to marry Livvy Dunne after she becomes pregnant by another man. He resolves to love Livvy and her baby. I fell in love with him the minute he said he would love the baby. Ray is a quiet, shy man. It is easy to mistake his quietness for lack of care but as their simple days pass by you see more and more that Ray is trying his best to fulfill his duties as a husband. He quietly listens to her complain about conversations of nothing but the weather and tries to learn about things that would interest her. There are no sex scenes in this beautiful story nor does it need it. Because there is nothing sexier than the devotion and love that Ray Singleton shows Livvy and her baby.

I love Keri Russell and have for years and years (think back to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids!). Skeet Ulrich was a brilliant pick for this role. The story unfolds with a lot of curiosity as we're not really made aware of what is happening to our heroine exactly...only that it seems she's been sent away for her own good. The mind starts to wander a bit, as we watch her start her journey, absently staring out of her passenger train window. I loved the opening, it leaves you hooked, you CAN'T not watch because you want to know just what is going to happen next. The moment they meet, and begin to talk and you realize just why Livie is there and then you just sit there thinking...ohhh this is gonna be good. From the start Skeet's portrayal of Ray is brilliant. He's soft spoken, gentle, and oh my gosh adorable! That man emotes with his eyes to the 10th degrees and can make a woman melt like a puddle of goo with one glance. It's that intense. Ray is a farmer, who has no desire to explore the world. Livie is worldly and wants to travel and discover ancient civilizations and have grand adventures. Livie, following the death of her mother, was taken advantage of by a military man that left her high and dry...and pregnant. Ray vows to love and honor her as her husband, and Livie dutifully agrees to the same for her father's sake alone while she still carries a torch for her fly boy. Over the course of Livie's pregnancy she gets to know Ray and his sister Martha, her husband and their children. She also befriends 2 girls (of Japanese heritage) who work Ray's farm. They are just 2 of many who were placed in internment camps during WWII, a part of our past that has been forgotten by history it seem. Livie eventually falls into a comfortable place on the farm but she won't let herself let go of the past and let her feelings for Ray show. There are some twists and turns and even a lovely (but gut wrenching) scene between Ray and Livie where he asks her ""Is there anything about me that you like, Livie?"" It's a great story about learning to forgive yourself and trust in love. It's just the most touching films Hallmark has EVER done and it makes me want MORE. One of the only times I can say a film has done the book it was based on justice.",1386288000,2,2305,4.325635103926097

2444851,5,B000BX5X5I,"I don't know Ann Howard Creel from Carl ""Crusher"" Creel, but I must thank her for writing such a fine novel, THE MAGIC OF ORDINARY DAYS. Hallmark's adaptation of it is that uncommon beast: a film created for the small screen that manages to be restrained yet utterly captivating, although, come to think of it, Hallmark has a habit of churning out the quality stuff. I hadn't seen much of Keri Russell. I'd only ever known Skeet Ulrich from the apocalyptic television series JERICHO. But these two actors submit performances that are sensitive and subdued and entirely engaging.

The plot goes like so: In July of 1944, a nervous Olivia (Russell) disembarks from the train. In the rural town of La Junta, Colorado she's greeted by a stoic farmer named Raymond Singleton (Ulrich). Ray is her future husband by arranged marriage, her father having ""convinced"" her of this union. Olivia - or ""Livy"" - was once a graduate student with an interest in archaeology, until her mother got sick and she had to quit school to tend to her final days. Lonely and grief-stricken, Livy fell into the arms of a stranger, some Air Force gent who was then shipped overseas. Flings sometimes have permanent consequences. Livy's father, learning of Livy's pregnancy, sent her away, it's assumed, in disgrace.

Ray's beet farm stands one hour away from the nearest town, which is La Junta, and Livy is soon made aware of how isolated she is from her lifelong comforts. Livy has a yen for foreign places and exotic cultures, and so imagine her frustration at her drab new environs. As well, Livy still pines for her wayward beau, that Air Force gent. She still sneaks him the occasional letter. Ray, a stranger who's become her sudden husband, is a man of few words and those words tend to revolve around farming. It'll take time for her to learn a lesson: that still waters run deep. It doesn't take long for Raymond to fall in love with Livy, who is lovely and refined. It'll take the unhappy Livy longer to reciprocate, if she comes to reciprocate at all.

Camille Thomasson deserves her propers for crafting a script that is sensitive and textured and ideally paced. There may not be flash to the story, but there's a quiet self-assuredness to how the plot is executed. Lest you forget that the narrative is unfolding during wartime conditions, a sub-plot is introduced concerning a local Japanese internment camp and the two female American-Japanese laborers whom Livy befriends. Livy is delighted to learn that the two sisters, Florence (Tania Gunadi) and Rose (Gwendoline Yeo) share her college background. I like that, in the face of the townspeople's hostility, Livy instinctively stands firm with her new friends.

I appreciate that Livy's pregnancy is handled with class. I like that the movie is patient with its characters. Russell and Ulrich are allowed to fully get into the skin of their characters. Livy and Ray and their cautious relationship are carefully developed. We see Livy slowly, hesitantly embrace her new life and culture. We see Ray, a good man coping with his own bit of devastation, try so hard, in his quiet way, to please Livy. When the happy ending comes - not that I'm saying there's a happy ending - it feels earned.

But let's not go into the unnecessary German P.O.W. subplot.",1363219200,,3292,4.809187279151944

2444896,5,B000BX5X5I,"""The Magic of Ordinary Days"" is one of my favorite movies of 2011.  I enjoyed watching this movie because it had a good story and it was about people who are good people.
It's not always easy to find movies like this.  The young lady, Livvy fell in love with an officer in the military and was pregnant.  Her father was a preacher and he could not live with this in his town.  Livvy had attended college and was very educated though she had left school to tend to her very ill mother who died.  A friend of another pastor in a small town found a very nice gentleman to marry this young lady and he knew she was pregnant.  At first Livvy was so home sick and still ""love sick"" of the man who got her pregnant.  She was not very nice to Ray, the man she married.  He told her he would love the baby and Ray did love that baby before being born.

It's a wonderful movie and it is so interesting how Ray and Livvy work things out to become a family who love each other.

At first glance, they seem to be a mismatch, but as the characters develop, Livy realizes that Ray is exactly what she needs.  The selfless love that Ray shows to Livy eventually wins her heart.

2444943,5,B000BX5X5I,"A delicate, romantic movie that emphasizes love, forgiveness, kindness, and unknown opportunities that might exist for anyone in any situation.  Beautifully photographed in Canada with super, but restrained performances by the whole cast including Keri Russell, Skeet Ulrich, and a terrific Mare Winningham.

A highly educated, young woman feels forced by situation and deep internal guilt after an unexpected pregnancy to move to isolated but beautiful S. Colorado to take a marriage with a total stranger in order to save face with her and her family.

These are different times with WWII blazing on, unsure about the father to be's willingness to assume responsibility, and a stern, moralizing father pressuring her, and who arranges the whole marriage thing with a lonely and emotionally hurt farmer.  The woman figures to move on after the delivery, or hopes somehow to reach the other man whom she pines for.

This story focuses on nice people from varied perspectives providing support and understanding rather than condemnation.  Keri's character meets and befriends Japenese- Americans interned as well as a brief excursion with a German POW.

I enjoyed the interactions between basically good people stuck in an awkward place: working on the farm, floating on a boat on the lake, learning to cook, going to a dance, learning about butterflies with new friends, simple talk, discovering the depth of love and pain in others.

Some might say, the whole story is too nice, too comfortable.  That's OK for me, nice change from so many brutal, in your face and over the top flicks.  Completely family friendly, but I think most kids would be bored with the underlying adult themes.

As almost all the other reviewers have said, and I agree, it's a sweet love story told in the Hallmark way and this is the strength of the movie for me: the story; acting; art direction; photography; direction and all the other elements that contribute to the magic of the movies all come together beautifully here.  The Hallmark Channel audiences aren't interest in the rough and tumble of real life as reflected in contemporary movies.

As someone else has mentioned, the book is not quite as good as the film, but I think that's because the cast is so perfectly chosen for their parts in the show and we have Ms. Creel's comments about the cast of characters in the book.  I did not find the subplot involving the two sisters to be unnecessary or lacking.  But that may well be because I so liked them in the movie.  Whatever, if you have not seen this movie, try your best to locate a copy.  I highly recommend it to you.

2444961,5,B000BX5X5I,"I fell in love with with this movie! It was a like a balm. No cliche`s here. Characters don't always do what you expect. I loved Mare Winningham's character, too. Highly recommended!",1260921600,4,182,4.71875
2444962,2,B000BX5X5I,"The plot is fairly straightforward.  Two people enter into an arranged marriage in rural Colorado in 1943.  The movie follows the early days of their marriage as they attempt to awkwardly navigate the emotional void between them and come to terms with their own motives for marrying a complete stranger.  This is where the movie fails. Most of the characters' development in the novel comes through personal reflection, and their back stories are revealed largely through their thoughts.  This leaves the screen writers at a major disadvantage, as they try to convey the complexity of Ray's and Liv's feelings through stilted dialogue.  There is a lot of exposition in the first half hour, so the dramatic tension never really develops.  The book was also lacking in dramatic tension, and the author attempted to create it with a ridiculous subplot that involves Livy being manipulated into helping a German POW escape.  This subplot has been included in the movie, and it ultimately just distracts from the more engaging story of Livy and Ray's marriage.

In the novel, there is a lot more character development, and Ray and Livy are fully flushed out.  In the movie, we are left with huge gaps in their stories that don't really explain why they have made the choices that they do.  Livy is pregnant, and the father is not in the picture, which does provide a perfunctory motive for her to be married off to a stranger.  However, there is so much more to her story, and most of it doesn't find it's way into the script.  Ray's motives for marrying Livy are a total mystery.  He is living alone on a farm that has been in his family for four generations, mourning the loss of his younger brother at Pearl Harbor.  His parents both died at an early age, and his sister is happily married and living up the road.  Ray is socially awkward, overburdened with the responsibility of tending the land alone, and lonely.  However, there is much more to his story, as well, and most of it doesn't find its way into the script.  Without those pieces, his decision to marry a pampered city girl who is pregnant with another man's child makes little sense.  Livy has never lived on a farm, she cannot cook, she knows nothing about keeping house, and she is clueless with animals.

That said, the scenery is beautifully photographed, and the actors do the best they can with the material they've been given.  Mare Winningham is particularly charming as Ray's older sister.  She is heart that keeps the movie grounded.",1258934400,16,2505,4.7390300230946885
2444963,5,B000BX5X5I,"I watch this movie all the time.  I love it that much!! I loved Ray with his quiet, gentle, strong, loving soul. He made a decision to marry Livvy and to love her and her baby. What a strange and unusual concept in this day. Not what he was getting but what he could offer Livvy.

Livvy wounded, heart-broken agrees to the arranged marriage set up by her father. She still holds onto the hope that she will be with the father of the baby one day.

She learns what real deep meaningful love is. It's not the heart pounding, weak kneed longings but the quiet, daily, offerings of oneself in trying to make anothers life sweeter, that is love.

Hallmark has made this into a sweet and tender movie. A great adaptation for an ok book.",1257292800,6,730,4.306569343065694
2444964,5,B000BX5X5I,"Hallmark has made a lot of great movies, but this one is something special.  The story line moves along smoothly and believably and Ray and Livy move from being awkward strangers to a couple who deeply loves one another.  The message seems to be that that sometimes you can find what you need in the most unlikely of people and circumstances.  And as much as I love the movie, the book is even better.  Ann Howard Creel has created characters that stay with you long after the last scene (or page).  Buy the movie and the book.  I highly recommend them both!",1252281600,5,558,4.421568627450981
2444965,5,B000BX5X5I,"I smiled though-out this film. There was seldom a moment when I wasn't smiling. That is how beautiful it is and how it made me feel. Hallmark has made many excellent family films,but The Magic Of Ordinary Days,may now be my favorite. I really enjoyed the sub-plot of Livy making friends with the two young women from the nearby Japanese internment camp,as it gave food for thought as well.

Truly an excellent romance film.",1249084800,6,423,4.716216216216216
2444966,5,B000BX5X5I,"I echo all of the positive reviews this movie has received. A friend loaned her copy to me, but I put off watching it. When I finally sat down to see it I was entranced. I caught myself smiling all the time at the goodness and wisdom of the characters. I bought a copy the next day and started loaning it to people immediately.
It does encompass some interesting and sometimes difficult topics--an unwed expectant mother and the father of the baby denies involvement; an arranged marriage; a seemingly harshly religious father; internment camps for Japanese Americans during WWII; prisoners of war; shallow, self-interested people vs. hard-working, down-to-earth folks.
As you watch the effects of unconditional love on a young woman who can't seem to forgive herself you feel the power that good people can have on the lives of those around them.
If you have to have action and intrigue to hold your attention, look elsewhere, but if you enjoy stories about interesting people and seeing characters develop and unfold, this is your kind of movie.",1244246400,4,1047,4.9209039548022595

2444968,5,B000BX5X5I,"I just watched this movie and it is officially on my favorite DVD list. In this time where lewd sex scenes are the order of the day, this movie is refreshing. A young educated lady is on her way to great things until tragedy strikes. Her mother falls ill and she has to leave school, her dreams of becoming an archaeologist in ruins. Her mother passes and in a time of loneliness, she falls in love with some guy and becomes pregnant. The father initially cannot be found and her father refuses to allow her to have the child out of wedlock. She is sent off to the middle of nowhere to marry a man who she does not know. Talk about putting the cart before the horse! They both get to know each other AFTER the marriage. Personalities are revealed and 'love comes softly'. It is such a beautiful family oriented film. Tender scenes of love with just a look or a held breath. Wonderful chemistry between Kerri and Skeet. One can only hope that Hollywood will try and produce a few more movies of this quality.",1230163200,6,1007,4.361702127659575

Livvy is a pregnant, unmarried woman moving out west to marry a complete stranger in order to ""make right the wrong"".  We see her go through many struggles with her new life, as well as make some important decisions.  Still, the whole atmosphere of the film is light and sweet.
I would recommend to anyone!",1228176000,3,477,4.511627906976744
2444970,5,B000BX5X5I,"I watched this made for tv movie (Hallmark production) and loved it so much that I had to purchase a dvd copy of it. I have watched several times since.

It is the story of girl (Kerri Russel) who got pregnant out of wedlock in WW2. Her father, a pastor, could not accept it and had her married to a shy beet farmer wonderfully played by Skeet Ulrich. In the beginning she feels superior towards him as she was already doing graduate studies and felt he was just an ignorant beet farmer. Although he was nice and his family was equally nice, she felt superior towards them. But as the story unfolds, she realizes what a gem she has found in him, his strong Christian values--his strength of character--and how he goes out of his way to make her happy. She realizes that she has found true love in this remote farm; a love she did not experience in her own home.

2444976,5,B000BX5X5I,"I majored in English Lit so I tend to avoid shallow romances where characters are two-dimensonal. But when a friend of mine insisted on lending me her DVD to watch this movie, I decided it might be a nice film to watch with my husband for Valentine's Day. I think I've watched it 4 or 5 times since then!

Livy arrives in the small CO farming community (1944) with very little luggage and only determined to stay until she can figure out a way to leave. She is still in love with the father of her baby, although he has certainly abandoned her. The contrast between Ray, the farmer who has agreed to marry her, and Edward could not be more stark. Ray is committed, patient, selfless and forgiving and Edward won't even own up to his responsibility. Although Livy can offer little of practical value on a farm--she can't cook, for one--Ray doesn't hold that against her as he patiently suffers through her dinner disasters. He tries to please her in every way, never seeming to realize that it is HE that is doing her the big favor.

I could go on, but this film has lots of irony, symbolism and character development. For example, it is the highly educated Livy that is the minister's daughter, but it is Ray that has the most faith in ""God's will."" And there is a lot to think about when it comes to the symbol of the butterflies. Also, both Livy and Ray change and grow in good ways throughout the film.

I was able to get my teenage daughter to watch and by the end she commented, ""I'd like to marry someone just like Ray--except not a farmer!"" Luckily, her dad is a lot like Ray so she already has a good model. Watching this movie has helped me to see where I can be more ""forebearing"" in my own marriage. I highly recommend it.",1203552000,47,1733,4.342592592592593
