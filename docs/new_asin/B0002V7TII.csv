2121423,5,B0002V7TII,"Dr Quinn is timeless and sensational. Started watching Dr Quinn as a teenager was a great eye opener to the past, what people went through, even the indians. I would recommend Dr Quinn to everybody.",1106784000,,198,4.685714285714286
2121424,5,B0002V7TII,"I have been a HUGE fan of the show for many years and as the seasons progress it just gets better and better.

I have to say that I only started watching it because of Joe Lando because I just thought he was absolutely GORGEOUS!!

Jane Seymour takes a bit of getting used to but you soon realise that she is absolutely 100% correct for this part.

Dr Quinn will always be a classic and it will remain timeless. If you are in need of a good storyline, plenty of romance and lots of real life issues then this is the show for you.",1102032000,4,528,4.0576923076923075
2121456,3,B0002V7TII,"I love this show, but as an Amazon Prime Member I had access to a bunch of my favorite shows, and their complete season. Today I have noticed I can only watch a handful of episodes now. Almost makes the Prime Membership less appealing. Might have to cave and get memberships elsewhere, and also replace my Fire tv with an Apple TV. Too bad.",1490745600,,340,4.328125

2121461,5,B0002V7TII,"I have followed Jane Seymour from the beginning of her career including the purchase of her book The Art of Romantic Living when it was a new release.  The uplifting and romantic notion of the characters in Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman is a refreshing escape to another period, The characters evolve so that one can't help but anticipate the next episode attesting to Jane Seymour's appellation of the Queen of Mini Series.  She is lovely and an excellent role model for aspiring women.  Joe Lando captures what is a woman's wildest imagination of the perfect mate - handsome, considerate, honorable, dependable, courageous, gentle, romantic, thoughtful, and loving - an excellent performance episode after episode of a rugged outdoors-man (even doing his own stunts which are numerous and exciting).  Costumes, hair and makeup, sets, and cinematography are award winning.  The towns people have varied personalities that depict many typical characters one might meet and provides examples of dealing with each in a performance meant to forge honest lasting relationships and amicable ethical resolutions. Social issues of that period which are still relevant are explored in a most creative and thought provoking dramatization.  The most intriguing and enriching thread of the entire series is the despicable unimaginable avarice regarding the treatment of Native Americans during the expansion of white settlements.  Bravo! This is a work of art that everyone should watch and enjoy!",1483660800,6,1481,5.3852813852813854

2121463,5,B0002V7TII,"I was highly surprised by how much I loved the show. I found the story line interesting but postponed it because I'm not into western and the wild frontier. Watching this has blown my mind in so many ways. It's one thing to learn history and another to see it play full out in a show. Watching this show made me appreciate and feel even more gratitude with the life we are blessed with and the freedom we have. To truly respect the women who have paved the road before us.
Every episode feels well written. I was impressed how it touches my heart often compared to the shows nowadays that only happens near season finale.",1470528000,3,621,4.362068965517241
2121464,5,B0002V7TII,"I love the series, but I can't stand the banker Preston!  He is disgusting and a troublemaker in his own rite.  I wish they would never have brought him into this excellent series.",1469404800,,180,4.424242424242424

2121510,5,B0002V7TII,"Beth Sullivan, who created and produced this series, has set a very high bar for us Americans to aspire to reach. Her characters reflect a realistic spectrum of attitudes and behaviors, yet the best among us always wins. This may appear unrealistic to some, but isn't it the goal of a democratic and free society to enable us humans to evolve to the highest possible spiritual state of being? And if this is the goal, the implication is that we all have an inner guide that we either  face and follow, or hide from and suffer the consequences. And most of us sometimes face and follow and sometimes hide. But in this country at least,  we can no longer blame some tyrannical force outside ourselves.  In this series, Ms. Sullivan was fearless about taking on almost every major societal problem surrounding the time period of Colorado Springs' founding and development. Her skill at giving her characters and situations depth while keeping their interactions and dialogue plausibly true, is remarkable. I only hope she will continue to create such honorable drama that inspires us to greater heights.",1453593600,3,1100,4.903225806451613
2121511,5,B0002V7TII,I loved this show when it first appeared on tv. When I watched it this time it was like meeting all my old friends again - definitely brought a smile to my face.

2121563,5,B0002V7TII,"I enjoyed Season 4 very much. I think the characters are becoming more multi-dimensional. I think the plot and subplots were more interesting and more intricate. I especially like that the producers allowed the characters to become involved in controversial situations--like racial and ethnic conflicts, cultural differences and personality conflicts. I am glad the producers let the characters express the hatred, conflicts, and racial epithets common to that era and did not water them down due to political sensitivity. It helps us to understand how we arrived at the places we reside today and what the roots of our problems are. If only those 19th century inhabitants had had the courage to be tolerant and accepting...Well we dream on. But at least we can see that a strong individual like Dr. Michaela Quinn had to fight hard and go against the cultural, racial and political tide to become her own self.",1448841600,,911,5.039735099337748

Dr. Mike saved the day each and every episode and made a political point to boot.  That was the whole point of these shows when they were produced and the messages are still relevant in today's world.
The last few shows of the season were very interesting.  I was wondering how they were going to get the baby born with Dr. Mike being the only Dr. in town.  Very inventive.
Take my advice and watch this show from the very first episode.  You will be glad you did.",1445558400,,503,4.2631578947368425

It's too bad the writers felt they had to darken the themes for various episodes to generate ratings, but the series continues to address issues that are as current today as they were in the fictional Dr. Quinn's time; i.e., racism, the federal government's relationship to sovereign Indian nations, voting rights, religion vs. evolution, etc.

Wholesome, sweet, old-fashioned, sentimental....all the things that are missing in today's entertainment world.  Yes, it was sappy and not very well acted, but who cares.... It was perfect escape fare...something we need more and more in today's difficult, complicated and often disturbing world!  If you want to truly escape....this is your ticket!!!

I have purchased every season for my teenage daughter.  She just barely remembered watching the TV series as she was very young when they were aired on TV.  She fell in love with the timeless magic that the characters of this TV series wove into every episode.  You don't have to worry about language, sex or lots of violence.

8032368,5,B0002V7TII,"I was a fan of this show when it originally aired on TV.  I found it on Amazon Prime TV and started watching (again).  I was amazed to discover that my fondness for this show only grew as I discovered the relevancy of the episodes portrayed.  It is a sad commentary on our society that many of the issues present when this show aired in the 1990s are still topics worth discussing today (30 years later).  Some story lines were based upon true events when Colorado Springs, CO was first coming into it's own in the Colorado Territory before becoming a state so while being a fictionalized depiction of the emerging West, it also provides a depiction of our history.",1517616000,,665,4.516666666666667
8032369,5,B0002V7TII,"I am surprised by how much I have enjoyed this heartwarming, family friendly show. It delivers some life lessons, applicable even today, without being preachy. It also gives the viewer a bird's eye view of what frontier life may have been like: the good, the bad, and the ugly. The series certainly underscores some of the comforts and conveniences we take for granted today.

This series is the continuing saga of Dr. Michaela Quinn, a medical doctor from a Brahmin Boston family from Beacon Hill, transplanted to Colorado Springs, which was then part of the frontier, in order to practice her profession. The series, thus far, takes place after the end of the  Civil War.

The episodes are interesting on a number of fronts, both on its handling of the social issues of the times and the medical practices of the day.  Moreover, all the recurring characters continue to develop and integrate themselves even more into the fabric of the episodes.

Yeoman performances are given by the beautiful and talented Jane Seymour in the starring role of Dr. Quinn, while Joe Lando continues in his role of eye candy Byron Sully, Dr. Quinn's soul mate and now husband. In season four, they are now expectant parents, adding a new dimension to their relationship, as well as to the show.

The writers of this show strive for authenticity of time and place. They also try to maintain the social mores of the time. They try to create a bridge between those social mores and our currently more permissive ones. It is not an easy task. Yet they admirably meet those constraints.

This is an excellent show for those who enjoy period dramas of the western frontier or even just a good, well-acted family saga.",1514160000,,1694,4.761092150170649

However, the writers did an out standing job of capturing te narrow minded, racist, xenophobic and misogenistic attitudes of the times, and the way the actors portrayed such. It was very unnerving that the lead character demonstrated such a judgmental know- it all attitude. And thee Native and Blak folks, in their humiliation,, forgave the whites!

This is an instructional piece of work that al BLAK, BROWN, RED children and their families must watch thru the 6th season. Nothing in w07, has changed. NUFF SAID!",1492128000,,595,4.721153846153846
