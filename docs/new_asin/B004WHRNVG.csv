4486509,5,B004WHRNVG,"For some reason, this page for the movie, Shelter, has the wrong tags attached. The movie Shelter with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is not available in the US (yet) -I've seen the PAL version. It's a great psychological thriller! JRM's character is complex and he plays it extremely well. This is one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen in a long time...it's a shame they haven't released it in the US yet. There is a link on the page for facebook but it brings you to the wrong movie. Happens to be also named Shelter. Anyone who owns a region free player, I'd recommend this movie.",1331596800,,585,4.580952380952381
8445083,5,B004WHRNVG,"Excellent movie. In the beginning of the movies, it seem familiar,  that's because I'd seen it before and the title was ""6 Souls"". Same movie different titles.",1445126400,,159,4.888888888888889

8445087,5,B004WHRNVG,"I have to wonder how many viewers of this movie (very well made even if it was a film essentially made for video rather than for theatre release) have had direct experience with the phenomenon of multiple personality disorder. I have had such experience in my life, most directly for almost a full year, and, to some extent, the film corresponds to my own perception of this weirdness, i.e., THAT IT IS REAL, whether the explanation of it be purely psychological and neurological, occult, spiritual, or a combination of such factors.

For example, the afflicted one's trauma and anguish that occur as one personality gives place to another is part of what I have witnessed numerous times. It is deeply unsettling and frightening, as just about everything to do with this disorder, mental or (as in this film) spiritual, perhaps in both cases supernatural to at least some degree. In the case of a friend (whose case, preserving his anonymity, was thoroughly documented by paranormal researchers and resulted in several theses and dissertations about him, as I eventually was to learn), some of the physical manifestations even went beyond what this film shows. Allied to all of this, as the son of a Portuguese witch, were the extraordinarily vivid powers of E.S.P. and of telekinesis (or psychokinesis) of some of this friend's personalities. Seeing the face change unrecognisably before one's eyes and the body turn, variously, taut or looser upon the bones, the paranormal powers sometimes activate, too, is profoundly shocking to witness, not to mention to hear changes in dialect and in languages that the individual persons speak and/or understand. The changes in personality can be downright frightful.

The film, ""Shelter: before He Takes Your Life, He Will Take Your Soul"", a.k.a. ""6 Souls"" (of which the DVD with catalogue release number 210474-DV is the one viewed) handles these phenomena well, with restraint, and, believe me, in some ways less bizarre than they can take place in real life. To give too much a description of the supernatural nature of the tormented soul that Jonathan Rhys Meyers portrays would be to convey ""spoilers"" of the kind that many prefer not to encounter in a review. Let's just say that the characters in this supernatural psycho-thriller are in for ""quite a ride on the wild side"" and leave it at that! I watched ""Shelter"" (""6 Souls"") for the second time the next evening after first having seen the movie, and it was as terrifying and vividly gripping as seeing it initially. The concluding moments, without verbalising anything, are of horrifying irony, like a stake driven into the viewer's own heart.

The movie's setting is urban Pittsburgh and in the Appalachian hills and mountains, where old ways and folk religion have flourished in relative isolation, not far away from Pennsylvania's metropolis. Most folks have heard tales of that region, so the cinematic milieu provides a credible sense of place and of primitive culture on which to peg the story. The result is a real work of art, however modestly this film has been marketed.",1415491200,3,3084,5.007797270955166
8445088,4,B004WHRNVG,"The movie was, apparently, straight-to-DVD, which I find disappointing, considering that Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actors (of female actors, two are actually my favorites: Ms. Moore and Cate Blanchett - they are both actors whose movies I watch just because they are in them, just as I watch movies with Johnny Depp, Robert DeNiro and Brad Pitt.  Natalie Portman is getting there - Black Swan was great).

Both actors in this movie give excellent performances, although the movie itself does not stand out.  But if you are a fan of Moore or Rhys Meyers, do watch.",1368835200,,574,4.777777777777778
8445089,5,B004WHRNVG,"Jonathan Rhys Meyers did a super job in this movie, as did Julianne Moore.
It is a shame that SHELTER got little to no play in the U.S....it certainly would have been
worth the price of the ticket. BUY IT!!!!!!",1368835200,,210,4.275
8445090,4,B004WHRNVG,"Jonathan Rhys Meyers and cast have given me another opportuniity to delve into a world of entertainment fantasy with Shelter.  JRM performances are always entertaining and I would love to see him in more lead roles.  This movie isn't a big blockbuster movie but it packs big entertainment thrills.  As it has not been released in the US, I played the region 2 DVD on my MAC and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Just give it a try and watch it!  You'll need to find your own shelter......",1345852800,,479,4.471264367816092
8445091,5,B004WHRNVG,"Intrigue, suspense and tension is what Julianne and Jonathan and their supporting cast deliver in this film...so well acted individually and together right up to the finale!  I simply cannot believe that Julianne does not have a number of Oscars under her belt by now...she so draws you right in to the journey she is on and makes each step along the way believable and inevitable but you only realise this once it takes place.  Fab film to watch and enjoy and without a doubt Jonathan pulls out the stops too.",1338595200,,510,4.593406593406593
8445092,4,B004WHRNVG,I had to buy this movie from out of the country...watch it on my comp as a region 2....and as im watching it the scenery looks familiar....it was made right in my home town... i couldn't believe all that trouble and it was filmed here...ha anyway jonathan does a wonderful job playing duel characters the way he did..he really made each one different...although i was disappointed where they went with the story as it unfolded...i don't  really know where i wanted it to go..however it wasn't there.....but the ending made it a tiny bit better. I would recommend it to people but i wish they would release it in the states..,1335052800,3,624,4.621621621621622
