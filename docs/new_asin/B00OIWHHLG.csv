6751860,4,B00OIWHHLG,"Documenting the band's unique performance of the ""Ghost stories"" album to an exclusive audience of fans in March 2014, ""Ghost stories live 2014"" presents Coldplay's ground-breaking production, nominated for Best Live Coverage at this year's UK Music Video Awards. Shot in a custom-built amphitheatre at Sony Studios, in LA, and filmed by Grammy-nominated director Paul Dugdale, it is an enjoyable spectacle, capturing this very special occasion. Frontman Chris Martin said that this sequenced film is basically the band's originally conceived idea: a visual representation of the ""Ghost stories"" album. Listening to these songs while watching the overhead imagery, actually feels much more satisfying than just listening to the immersive dreamlike soundscape of the album which, ever since its release, left me with the impression that it was void of a certain something. ""Ghost stories live"" is the missing element, it seems to be working as a great companion to the album. The release also contains an exclusive live album, recorded between April and July 2014 at the band's shows in London, Sydney, Paris, Cologne, NY and LA. The package is completed by 8 music videos, including 2 films for B-Sides ""All your friends"" and ""Ghost story"", plus the extended director's cut of the ""Magic"" video.",1416873600,13,1295,5.321951219512195

6751884,3,B00OIWHHLG,"I watched this concert On Demand on my local cable company for weeks and I loved it!  Needless to say, I was disappointed when it cycled out and became unavailable.  So, I jumped at the chance when I saw the Blu-ray version of the concert available for sale.  When I popped it into the DVD (still cold from being in the mailbox) I was happy to see that it was the same concert as I saw on cable...almost!  This disc contains ONLY the music from the Ghost Stories CD, while the concert I watched on tv contained selections from previous CDs, including: Paradise and Viva La Vida, two of my Coldplay favorites.  Those songs were edited out.

Why they chose to edit and butcher a great concert is beyond me.  Had I not seen the full concert previously, it probably wouldn't have bothered me too much.  Alas, I'll keep looking until I find a disc with the entire concert.  You should, too.",1424044800,2,885,4.41358024691358
