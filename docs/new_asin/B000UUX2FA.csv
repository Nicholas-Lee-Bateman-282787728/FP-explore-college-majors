8615849,4,B000UUX2FA,"First off, this title is a off beat from the Serious title Battle Fairy Yukikaze and die hard anime fans will probably turned off by this title.  For me, I enjoyed the movie even though it was only 1 episode long and concept of the story is probably rampantly found in other anime parodies.

Seriously, I'm not sure why everyone is getting this title low marks, people have to realize, this is not intended to be a serious anime unlike its story that is it base off.  Sure, the plot sounds corny, guy goes to anime convention, gets sucked into a anime inspired world where the jets are portrayed as girls and they tell him that they will be erased from existence once the anime fans go to another show.

Like I said, its corny but very humorous and light-hearted.  As most anime fans would say, give it a try you may like it.  If you don't want to spend the money on it, get a netflix account and rent it before you buy it.

Until next time, peace out!",1206316800,4,952,4.2555555555555555
8615850,1,B000UUX2FA,"Rei Sugiyama wins a ticket to a Yukikaze/Stratos 4 convention. He's grown up in a small town and he's never been away on his own before so his parents are very reluctant to let him go to the big city. While Rei is being overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people at the convention, he goes through a doorway that leads to another world. He finds himself in a desert where the jets of the anime Yukikaze have taken the form of five cute young girls and women. There's the ditz fighter Mave, the big boobed Super Sylph, the mother hen Sylphide, and the always disrespected duo of One-chan and Two-chan. They are fighting against a super-sized villain named Forgettor. The world that Rei has entered into is the world of the imagination created by the love of the show's fans. But Mave and the other girls exist only as long as the fans interest is not diverted to other anime shows. This lack of attention is embodied in the Demon of the Oblivion, the monstrous Forgettor!

If you're not familiar with the anime series Yukikaze or Stratos 4 you might be missing the boat by buying this very brief, almost inconsequential one episode dvd. If you don't know, Yukikaze was about an inter-dimensional gate that opened at the South Pole. Groups of highly advanced fighter craft were sent through the gate to battle aliens. I have watched all of the Stratos 4 series, but have only viewed the first volume of Yukikaze. Even if you are a huge fan of those two shows, there's nothing really here to write home about. While the animation is done quite well, there is not enough time to do anything with the characters and the cheezy storyline is so bad that its really not even worth mentioning. This dvd seems like an overlong promo clip to be shown at conventions to slavering otaku fans who would love any cute girl in military fatigues. For a regular fan of anime, it's simply a waste of money. This should be sold with Freedom Volume 1 as a double rip-off special. Ok, actually this one episode of Mave-chan was Oscar-caliber compared to the HD-DVD release of Freedom Volume 1. At least we're not being charged 40$!

Extras: Clean closing and very VERY brief promo video.",1193529600,5,2165,4.5629820051413885
