2768504,4,B000NEJIBU,"Everyone who has watched ""A Bridge Too Far"" will want to watch ""Theirs Is the Glory.""  The two films portray the same battle, but in different ways.

""A Bridge Too Far"" is the more lavish production, and at first glance ""Theirs Is The Glory"" in black and white doesn't make the same screen impact.  Still, the 1946 film was made with many veterans of the battle on the screen, giving it more ""close in time"" realism, and it was filmed on location at the site of the battle.

These veterans do not deliver their lines like Hollywood stars.  ""A Bridge Too Far"" has the more polished and dramatic dialog.  If you're interested in real soldiering and real leadership, not the Hollywood facsimile, however, ""Theirs is the Glory"" is the better film.  Especially inspiring are Major Richard Lonsdale and Major Frederick Gough, who play themselves in the film.  Seeing how these two men -- not Sean Connery, not John Mills, not Gene Hackman -- actually roused the spirits of their paratroopers makes the movie well worth watching.

Made so soon after the costly miscarriage that was Operation Market Garden, ""Theirs is the Glory"" shies away from fully confronting the failures of planning and leadership that cost so many lives, focusing on the ""glory"" of British paratroopers fighting against long odds.  ""A Bridge Too Far,"" made with the benefit of more than 30 years of hindsight, is the more tragic movie.  Seen together, the two films can be a good starting point for a real analysis of the battle.

2768506,5,B000NEJIBU,"Being 72, I originally saw this movie when it was first released in the 40s. After ""A Bridge Too Far"" was released, I recognized the story and did a Google Search to see if I could find the original, I'm glad I did as I was able to get the DVD copy from you.
This is the REAL TRUE VERSION of what really happened in Arnhem, and anyone interested in WW II history should watch it.

2768507,5,B000NEJIBU,"Aside from the prompt delivery and exceptional quality of both the DVD and the footage within, I can only remark that it worked fine and was completely viewable in my DVD (PC) player without having to alter any settings whatsoever.

Many thanks for having made it available and I highly recommend it to anyone interested.",1271289600,4,321,4.836363636363636
2768508,5,B000NEJIBU,"I would classify this more as a documentary.  The thing that makes this worthwhile is that it was made by veterans in 1945 on the actual battle site- not actors.  All of the equipment and vehicles are real including King Tigers and Panthers roaming the streets.  There is a lot of great footage of the battlefield area.  It is a great reference for the battle of Arnhem and Osterbeek.

Even though this was a PAL format dvd it played fine on my LG Blu Ray player.",1267488000,5,463,4.337209302325581
2768509,5,B000NEJIBU,"This film was made immediately after WW2 and was shot on location in the UK and Holland. It depicts the events of the British part of Operation Market Garden, the plan devised by Field Marshal Montgomery to end the War in 1944. This was to be done by dropping 35,000 US, British and Polish paratroopers along a 62 mile corridor through Holland, and whos mission was to capture the bridges over the various rivers to allow the British 2nd Army to finally advance over the Rhine and into the industrial Ruhr area of Germany, capturing all of the Nazis war factories and ending the War. However, as events turned out, this did not happen, as 2 German SS Panzer Divisions were stationed in and around Arnhem, Holland, and after 10 days of some of the hardest fighting seen in Europe during WW2, the Allied advance was stopped 5 miles short of its objective, the Bridge at Arnhem. The Arnhem bridge and area around Oosterbeek was first captured, then defended by the British 1 Airborne Division, and it is this action which the film covers.

The Best War Film Ever is a big claim, especially when you compare it to some of the other films in the genre, so what makes it special? Simply that this film was shot on location and starred the very men who fought in the battle. In the aftermath of the battle, the Germans drove the Dutch inhabitants out of Arnhem, and sealed the town off for the rest of the War. The views you see of Arnhem are actual scenes of the battlefield, unchanged and untouched from the end of the fighting! All the equipment is authentic as well, but what makes the film truely stand out is that the majority of the actors, especially all the extras, but most of the main players, were soldiers who had ACTUALLY served during the battle, (for instance, the Colonel who gives the talk from the church pulpit really was the same Officer who had given the original speech during the Battle itself). These men were recreating the very battle they had fought in. In fact, during breaks from the filming, many of the actors would go off and help clean up other areas of the battlefield, defuse unexploded ordance, collect disused weapons, or simply aid in the identification and reburial of fallen comrades.

It might not have the same expensive special effects, or tragi-noble story as some more modern and famous war films, but as a representation of a Battle, and as a monument to the heroism shown by soldiers in battle, this film is the best there is.",1219708800,4,2467,4.579185520361991
2768510,5,B000NEJIBU,"I am disappointed this is a copy of a film.

Now on the very positive side,it is fabulous,done very well and clear and great sound !!
But I would always like some one to tell me up front its a copy,and then let me make up my mind whether to keep searching,or settle for a copy.
I figured the relatively high price of this convinced me it was an original.

9 times out of 10 I will always buy the original,regardless of cost.
This way,I am not aware it is a copy til I have purchased it.

And Amazon makes a big mistake by not letting you ask questions of the
the seller..this way these questions would be out of the way.
Another way would be to have Amazon make that clear..you must warn people it is a copy.
Plus it stated it was PAL..uh..a copy doesn't make much difference.
Any player will play this.

All that aside,I am delighted with this very rare wonderful film.
So I very much recommend it !!
It is an exceptional film.
Do not miss out on this film because it is a copy please !
You will not be disappointed at all.",1192492800,2,1024,4.130653266331659

8177541,5,B000NEJIBU,"This is not flashy piece of cinema, it is a documentary of British 1st Airborne and their role in operation Market-Garden. The actors in this film are the men that took part in the battle, and when one thinks that almost 80% were killed, wounded or captured in this battle, it gives pause. History buffs should make this a must see. Bravo British Airborne!",1464393600,,356,4.578125
8177542,4,B000NEJIBU,Very good and very realistic. It showed just what a tragedy Arnhem was..,1445472000,,72,4.615384615384615
8177543,5,B000NEJIBU,"Fascinating work.  From a scale modeler's perspective, this is a jewel.  A combination of newsreel and footage shot right after the war.  Features a fair amount of captured German equipment that likely doesn't exist any more.",1413849600,,225,5.194444444444445
8177544,5,B000NEJIBU,"No, it's not as slick and smooth as ""A Bridge Too Far"".

That's because the scenery is real - it was where the battle was fought a year before the film was shot.

And those actors, unlike those in ""A Bridge Too Far"", were there a year before the film was shot.  Being shot at by the Germans.

It doesn't get much better than this.",1396137600,2,330,4.030769230769231
8177545,5,B000NEJIBU,"Original footage from the actual landings mixed with re filmed storyline using the actual troops, machines and civilians that were there. DVD required no special reader in my American player.",1388620800,,191,5.4
8177546,2,B000NEJIBU,"These Brits are pathetic, with their stilted and wooden words, driving around in their U.S. equipment, while being rounded up by the superior Wehrmacht Germans, better than them, even after some 3 years fighting the mighty Soviet Army.

Could the Brits have lasted this long in the war without American help?

Not bloody likely.

Cheers.

8177547,4,B000NEJIBU,"Above average post WWII British movie about the battle for Arnhem as part of Operation Market Garden in September 1944. Made in 1946 and filmed in Arnhem, it states that all scenes were either recorded or witnessed by survivors. You can tell that a lot of scenes from the much later ""A Bridge Too Far"" were taken from this film. Real Panthers, Tigers and certainly a bit of flag waving. Well done and worth an evening. Saw it on Netflix so you don't need a PAL player to see it if you are a member.",1358812800,2,498,4.252631578947368
