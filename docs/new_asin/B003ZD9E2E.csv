4233472,3,B003ZD9E2E,"Few performers can rival the career of Cher and few can fill their case with the awards she has received including an Academy Award, a Grammy, an Emmy, and more.  Not only does she hold the Hot 100 record for the longest hit making career span with 33 years between the release of her first and most recent number one singles, she also starred in her first motion picture (Good Times) in 1967 and returns to the big screen in 2010's ""Burlesque"".

It is the release of ""Burlesque"" that prompts MGM to package six of the actresses performance into ""Cher: The Film Collection"" which hit shelves on November 2nd 2010.  Though the set does not include some of the films you may expect such as ""Mask"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"", and ""Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmie Dean Jimmie Dean"", the set does provide one with the evolution of an actress.  The exclusion of the above mentioned films certainly has more to do with studio politics than with their respective worthiness.

The films in the collection include six films for the true Cher fan, but only three for movie fans.  Opening with ""Good Times"" from 1967 we are introduced to Cher, and then husband and performing partner Sonny Bono, playing themselves trying to come up with an idea for a movie in which they can star and thus capitalize on the fame currently being generated by their hit records.  ""Good Times"" combines the camp of the beach movies of the era with the sketch comedy that Sonny and Cher would display in their hit television show.  The comedy sketches on the ""The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour"" usually lasted about five minutes, which is how much actual good time can be found in this bomb.

Two years later Sonny would write and produce ""Chastity"" in an attempt to showcase Cher as a serious actress.  Unfortunately the film showcases a lack of writing and direction, and Cher appears to be wandering aimlessly through the film in both character and performance.

Luckily for Cher, she would stay away from the big screen for more than ten years.  The absence allows the few movie goers who experienced ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" time to get over those weak efforts, and time for Cher to grow as an actress.  Though it does not appear to be a big stretch for her, Cher's performance in ""Silkwood"" displays substantial growth from her previous endeavors and garnered her a Best-Supporting Actress nomination.  Silkwood is a powerful film that clearly belongs to Meryl Streep, who portrays Karen Silkwood, the nuclear facility worker who takes on a huge corporation. Despite Silkwood being a starring vehicle for Streep, Cher holds her own alongside both Streep and Kurt Russell.

Two years after the ""Silkwood"", Cher would cement herself as a leading lady in ""Mask"".  Unfortunately ""Mask"" is not included in this collection.  Up to this point there was a similarity in the characters Cher portrayed, but in 1987 she would truly show her range by starring in ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""Suspect"". and ""Moonstruck"".  The later being the only one of the three included in this collection, and clearly the gem in Chers storied career as she sheds all pre-conceived notions as to who she is and what she can do in this Academy Award winning performance.  Cher portrays Italian widow Loretta with subtle brilliance in this Norman Jewison directed romantic comedy that also features Nicolas Cage, Olympia Dukakis, Danny Aiello, and Vincent Gardenia.

Unfortunately Cher would follow ""Moonstruck"" three years later with the disappointing ""Mermaids"".  Though surrounded by a talented cast including Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci, and the always enjoyable Bob Hoskins,"" Mermaids"" drowns amidst a sea of eighties tripe.  This pointless story follows single mom Cher and her two daughters (Ryder and Ricci) from town to town as Cher attempt to avoid scandal.  ""Mermaids"" is full of squandered potential in both storytelling and performance, as all lack development.

The Cher film collection is rounded out by ""Tea with Mussolini""; an elegant endeavor set in pre WWII Florence Italy where the elite meet.  Surrounded by a legendary cast of actresses including Dame Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith, and Lily Tomlin, Cher plays an American performer and lover of art who invades the serenity of the English ladies environment, and eventually becomes their savior amidst the outbreak of war.  ""Tea with Mussolini: is an investment as it takes time for the story to develop and to appreciate Chers performance as her portrayal of the brash American is so strong, that it seems jarringly out of place in the first hour of this stylish film.

Though a perfect Christmas present for any Cher fan, and certainly priced to move, this new offering may struggle during the holiday shopping season simply due to an audience that already owns the popular inclusions, and has no interest in films they quite possibly have not heard of.  The lack of bonus material does not help the situation.

There are certainly fans of ""Mermaids"" out there that will balk at the review, but it is ""Silkwood"", ""Moonstruck"", and ""Tea with Mussolini"" that make this collection worth owning.  ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" are fun for a few minutes simply to see the early years, but not worth owning.

Recommendation: Buy the collection if you don't already own the films, and give away ""Good Times"" and ""Chastity"" as white elephant gifts.",1292976000,9,5376,4.913716814159292
4233473,5,B003ZD9E2E,"Just in time for the holiday season, Cher: The Film Collection is released.

This is a set of films that Cher fans, movie fans, cine-philes, and everyone in between can enjoy. Six movies featuring our girl Cher are presented beautifully in one collection for a reasonable price.

Good Times (1967) was an outrageous vehicle for Sonny and Cher. This movie was made slightly before their hugely successful TV show. Good Times is about Sonny trying to come up with an idea for a movie for the two of them to star in. It is goofy and extremely campy; what would you expect from these two. Not the greatest movie in the collection, but worth a watch on a lazy afternoon. William Friedkin (The Exorcist) makes his directorial debut.

Chastity (1969) sounds familiar? Sonny and Cher's daughter, well now son, was conceived during the making of this movie.  She was named after this movie, not the movie being named after her (contrary to popular belief). Sonny wrote this for Cher because he wanted to showcase her as a serious actress. This may be Sonny's best attempt to be serious, but the goofiness of the movie is almost outweighing the seriousness. The drama that went on behind the scenes on this movie would have made for a better movie. Cher cheated on Sonny because she was furious with him over how Chastity was turning out. There is next to no plot to this movie. Cher plays Chastity, a curious girl exploring the world of sex and drugs.

Silkwood (1983) is amazing. Cher plays a supporting character, Dolly, who is Meryl Streep's roommate and best friend. Cher plays a lesbian with no flash or fance....and she does it beautifully. Never before or after has Cher looked so homely. This film is a drama in the highest degree. No longer in print, the only way to get this would be to buy it used or in this collection. Mike Nichols directs.

Moonstruck (1987) is Cher's best known role. She was an academy award for her portrayal of an Italian lady trying to do the right thing in her own way. She is magnetic here, magical, even heart wrenching. One of the greatest performances from any actress. One of the greatest movies ever made. Definitely not to be missed.

Mermaids (1990) completes Cher's emergence into film stardom. Cher is the Jewish mother of two girls trying to grow up in the 1960s. Like any mother, Cher's character makes it as difficult as she can. After another break up, Cher, as Mrs. Flax, loads up the car and drives everyone to Massachusetts to begin another new life there. Of the movies in this collection, Mermaids is by far the most fun.

Tea with Mussolini (1999) finds a relatively small part for Cher. Maybe one of the most underrated movies of this time period, Tea with Mussolini is remarkably thoughtful and heartfelt. Set just before WWII, a group of wealthy English women raise a child whose mother has died. It's nice to see that this movie was included in this set and can be brought into the light once again. Maybe more people will appreciate it after a second viewing.

There it is, 6 movies on 6 disc's. If you own these movies already individually, its not worth buying as there are no new special features on here.

Sadly missing from this collection are a handful of Cher's great films like Mask, Witches of Eastwick, Suspect, If These Walls Could Talk, Faithful, Stuck On You, and most upsetting of all, Come Back to the Five And Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (which has still YET to be released on DVD!!!!)

Bottom Line:

If you don't already own these movies, do yourself a favor and buy this collection. These will surely warm up your cold winter nights this holiday season.

With love.",1288915200,36,3637,4.62888198757764
4233474,1,B003ZD9E2E,I was so excited when I heard about this box set.  Until I saw what it actually is.  As a true Cher fan I have been waiting for years for 'Come Back To The Five and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean' to finally be released on DVD. This collectiob has their early movies but still is missing this vital one.  These have all been available on DVD for years.  So disappointed they haven't released one of her best films.  If it had been included I would have bought the whole set just for that one movie.,1286236800,13,494,4.104166666666667
4233475,5,B003ZD9E2E,"Not many entertainers can say they have done it all, but Cher is the exception. Singer, recording artist, gay icon, concert performer, televison personality, and movie actress. This beautiful box set shows the world Cher's varied career on the big screen with movie performances from the 1960's to the late '90's, and its really a neat time capsule into one of the most extraordinary women of our time.

 This set features six of Cher's films, from major boxoffice bombs to Oscar winning films that have gone on to be loved by fans and critics alike. The first two movies are really unforgettable: ""Good Times"" (1967) features Sonny and Cher as themselves doing spoofs of various films. As bad as that one is ""Chasity"" (1969), named after their daughter, is even worse. Written and produced by Sonny it was suppose to showcase Cher's dramatic capabilites. Instead both films are pretty much forgotten and although they were terrible one can see the potential Cher had, even at this early point in her career, to become a respected and sought-after actress. It is evident: the talent was there, but the material was non-existent.

 Next we have ""Silkwood"" (1983). Although a major movie vehicle for Meryl Streep, Cher proved she could act with the best of actresses and hold her own. She really steals the film. While watching Cher in this, you forget about the music, the Bob Mackie costumes, and the persona; instead you see a future Oscar winner toning her craft.

 Of course everyone knows ""Moonstruck"" (1987), the movie that garnered Cher her Oscar as Best Actress where she proved to everyone, even the Hollywood naysayers, that she COULD act. Sonny Bono told her on the day of the Academy Award's ceremony that she was going to win...obviously he always knew she had the talent.

 ""Mermaids"" (1990) features Cher's fun side and it has a great soundtrack, with the film grossing an amazing $80,000,000 at the boxoffice.

 Finally, ""Tea With Mussolini"" (1999) is a story about a young Italian boy being raised by American and English women. Cher co-stars with some of the most talented English women of all-time in this, including Joan Plowright, Judi Dench, and Maggie Smith. Lily Tomlin also co-stars.

 Simply, a fun entertaining box set that will please all Cher fans and just in time for the Holidays.",1285718400,15,2310,4.894871794871795
4233476,4,B003ZD9E2E,"""Tea with Mussolini"" is one of those films you can watch again and again & see something new and be entertained all over again. One of Cher's finest roles in my opinion. I love all the English actors too!

4233493,3,B003ZD9E2E,"I've been a Cher fan most of my life and had all her movies on VHS and wanted to upgrade to DVDs and when I found this box set, I was so excited because it contains most of her films in one set for an unbeatable price (I paid $10.99 on here). Included in the set are 6 of her movies: Good Times (1967), Chastity (1969), Silkwood (1983), Moonstruck (1987), Mermaids (1990), and Tea with Mussolini (1999). The movies come on 6 discs and come in a pretty metallic box with a gorgeous photo of Cher on the front. What I love about this set is that you can see her evolve as an actress from her first film and see her talent improve with each film.

I am however very disappointed that some of her best films weren't included like Mask, Suspect, and Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean (still never released on DVD and Suspect is no longer available on DVD as far as I know except on Ebay). These films featured some of her best performances. Instead, Good Times and Chastity were included and while it's neat to watch them once and have her first forrays into acting as a collector, I definitely wouldn't watch these 2 stinker films again because they are so bad and poorly written that they didn't showcase her true talent like the aforementioned not included films did. Another thing I was disappointed with is that I wish there had been some bonus features for each of the movies like commentaries from Cher/co-stars or behind the scenes looks. It just gives the impression that the set was thrown together.

Regardless, this is a good set for the die hard Cher fan for an unbeatable deall!",1389744000,2,1606,4.404040404040404

I had a lot of fun re-living these past dvds and especialy MOONSTRUCK the one she won the Academy Award for,

 Cher had so much talent, in the beginning of her career too, while watching Chastity, although some younger fans didn't really get it, a film with a wonderful soundtrack. We all saw a very nave Cher in a nude scene very brief scene, and she acted her heart out in the ending scene where she re-lived the pain of being abused, and her visit to the Mexican whore house, as usual she had a lot of truthful things to say as usual, then she mostly wore jeans and a tank top.
Now that she is a legend and this is her REAL farewell concert, these movies make you see how very far she has come.
I love all her beaded dresses and risqu dresses she wears in public and on her shows with Sonny.

She is truly one of a kind, no one can come close to her because she is truly a trend setter and knows new trends before anyone else.
I just adore her and will be very sad after her last concert, if I had the money I would get the ringmaster doll but it is far beyond my means, but I have a good collection of her interviews, photos, and other concert programs.

I wanted to swing my hair like Cher and walked around wishing I was a ""half-breed"" or hung with the ""gypsies, tramps and thieves"" that she sang about during the lazy, hazy 70's.

Receiving this gift set was truly, a gift. Laying on the couch over the last two weeks being unable to do anything has been made bearable thanks to books and movies. How many re-runs of Friends, and Everybody Loves Raymond can one watch?

Moonstruck is by far one of my favorite movies. The paring of Nicholas Cage and Cher was shear magic. And, Mermaids, well....who didn't want a mom who served cheese doodles for dinner?

For a woman who started out on TV, showing her belly button and swinging her long, silky, straight black hair, Cher has really made a name for herself.

As the daughter of a Gay man who absolutely loves Cher, I can tell you that passing this along to Dad as much as I want to won't be happening. I had never seen Tea With Mussoloni or Chasity and loved them too.

Cher's range is truly impressive. The woman shocked the world with her costumes in the 80's but I believe as an actress she is one of the best.  I cannot wait to see her newest Burlesque with Christina Aguilerar. It will surely be excellent.

8410128,2,B003ZD9E2E,"The Cher Film Collection by MGM (not FOX as Amazon indicates) is a good collection of movies. For the most part the transfers are good and the aspect ratios are correct. Just 2 points, one minor and one major.  Firstly all movies have subtitles except Mermaids which has closed captions. Closed captions went out the door the moment dedicated DVD/Blu ray players hit the market.  Secondly and more importantly, Silkwood is presented in non-anamorphic letterboxed 1.85:1 meaning the viewer has black bars on all 4 sides unless you zoom which reduces resolution.  The fact this box set was released in 2010 when non-anamorphic presentation was long dead shows that MGM has wheeled out the same old DVD and bundled it in the set without bothering to remaster from the original as anamorphic widescreen.  Shame, shame shame... MGM.  It is ironic that Amazon lists Fox as the release company. MGM has a bad reputation for releasing earlier widescreen as non-anamorphic whereas Fox does not. It's a pity Fox didn't release this set.",1485820800,,1026,4.976608187134503
8410129,5,B003ZD9E2E,"This is a great lot of films. I especially like Good Times, which is a wonderfully catchy musical. Chastity didn't make a lot of sense but I still kind of liked it. Silkwood is nice yet hallowing, worth the oscar. Moonstruck, Mermaids, and Tea With Mussolini are great as well. When I first ordered it, there was a scratch in two of the discs. But I sent it back without issue and got a perfect one in the end.",1471132800,,410,4.2025316455696204

8410135,3,B003ZD9E2E,Moonstruck is the standout; 2 more are good and 2 are not so good. Every part she plays is Cher which works for some movies and not so much for others.,1424217600,,151,3.903225806451613
