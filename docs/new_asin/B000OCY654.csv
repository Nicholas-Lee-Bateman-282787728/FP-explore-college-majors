2794347,5,B000OCY654,"Hands down, the BEST documentary out there about New Orleans. For the first time ever, a documentary that's been produced by someone not from New Orleans that actually ""gets"" our city. It really has the voice of the people and demonstrates to the rest of the world why New Orleans is so unique and why it's so important for us to preserve this great American city. It even talks about tourists that come to New Orleans and only experience the 5 blocks of Bourbon Street then leave, never seeing the true beauty of this place. It explores the full history of the city, from its birth to the current situation and why the city was the way it was when Katrina struck. It also talks about different facets of the culture that makes it so distinct. Did I mention that it's the BEST New Orleans documentary out there? What are you waiting for? Buy it already!",1176336000,36,853,4.4743589743589745
2794348,5,B000OCY654,"This is the best thing out there on New Orleans. If you have any interest in New Orleans - why we cook like we do, dance like we do, play music like we do - this gives it to you. This is from the PBS series ""American Experience"" and PBS did it well. This is not a ""Katrina"" piece. Although Katrina factors in at the end, it is not the focus. Here the story starts with the folks that founded the City and moves through to Katrina. Along the way, it pulls no punches and includes the lowlights with the highlights. Even if you know New Orleans, there is plenty here that you will enjoy. I'm getting extras for gifts.",1175126400,46,615,4.133333333333334
2794349,3,B000OCY654,"Liked it a lot, especially the parts on the 1927 flood and blowing up the levees.

Hard to believe-- 36 tons of dynamite to do something that was patently stupid?

I guess that's what happens with politics.

Liked the program despite the occasional anti-white bias.",1368662400,,265,4.844444444444444
2794350,2,B000OCY654,"I don't feel that the producer of this was very serious about his or their work, It is a half assed attempt to con us out of money..
 Save you money buy ammo..........",1360108800,,167,4.0606060606060606
2794351,5,B000OCY654,"If you haven't seen FAUBOURG TREM, then this is definitely the documentary to buy if New Orleans interests you, or like me, you've just awoken to its special charm via the TV series TREM.
It is a very well detailed account of the city's history, almost from Big Bang until today, and is very much more extensive than that other fine documentary, FAUBOURG TREM, which deals more with the neighbourhood of the same name from which the TV series takes its cue.
All the better known aspects of N.O. are covered, so that you are not left in any doubt as to why music, particularly jazz, refined cuisine and the art of living in general took such firm hold here. It must have been a truly amazing place during the last century and a half, and although much was lost in the devastation caused by Katrina, and the general effect of modern day utilitarianism, some of its magic still appears to live on.
As I haven't been there, this documentary will have to stand as a good substitute for the real thing. Meanwhile,roll on HBO's TREM.",1333843200,2,1026,4.521505376344086
2794352,5,B000OCY654,"Excellent documentary, I could almost smell the magnolia and jasmine in the air.  Born and raised there but left when I was 18 to join the military and never moved back.  Now I know why I've always felt like a refugee.  Just as Tennessee Williams said, (paraprashed) ""New Orleans is the place I go for refuge"".  I agree.  Each time I land at Louis Armstrong Airport I feel as though the city is giving me a warm hug welcoming me home.",1298332800,3,434,4.308641975308642
2794353,3,B000OCY654,"Hard to rate. I love the city so I love any reminders of the place. Interesting and a good length, but it doesn't really capture the spirit of this amazing city.",1295308800,,161,4.225806451612903
2794354,5,B000OCY654,"The previous reviews say it all. It is simply the best documentary ever produced on the history and culture of New Orleans. I have watched the first three episodes of the HBO series, ""Treme,"" and highly recommend it to anyone who is enjoying that series, and to those who are looking for more, in terms of historical documentation and the human spirit that has created the city AKA ""The Big Easy.""",1272931200,12,397,4.605633802816901
2794355,4,B000OCY654,"pretty good all around. the two deleted scenes in the special features section would actually have been the best scenes in the film. i have no idea why they would include a lengthy piece on short term visitor tennessee williams (lived in the city from 1939 - mid-1940s) and cut scenes about a jazz funeral and one about a mardi gras indian. every documentary about new orleans that i've seen leaves something out, something that i can't put my finger on, but perhaps i'm shopping for milk at a hardware store. this is still the best i've seen that's on the city in general and not a specific aspect of it i.e. music, hurricane.",1264204800,8,627,4.508771929824562
2794356,5,B000OCY654,"THIS DVD VIDEO IS AMAZING.  MY HUSBAND AND I RETIRED IN THE SOUTH TWO YEARS AGO AND ENJOY GOING INTO NEW ORLEANS FOR WEEKEND GETAWAYS.  IT IS AN AMAZING CITY, AND THIS BOOK WAS AN AMAZING HISTORY OF THE ""BIG EASY"".  IN FACT IT IS SO GOOD WE ORDERED IT AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON IN LAW WHO GREW UP NEAR THERE.  IT'S JUST A GREAT HISTORY OF A GREAT CITY.  WE RENTED IF ON NETFLIX AND LOVED IT SO MUCH I WENT ON AMAZON TO SEE IF I COULD PURCHASE IT THERE, AND VOILA! IT WAS HERE IN FOUR DAYS.  LOVE AMAZON",1257984000,3,506,3.7714285714285714
2794357,4,B000OCY654,"I understand this documentary was spurred by the inappropriate comment of House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert, who suggested shortly after Katrina had inundated the city, perhaps the United States should not spend any money rebuilding New Orleans.  This documentary is at the same time a living portrait of the city, but also describing its many problems, products of its historical evolution. The discussion of the Board Liquidation was fascinating.  Unelected officials (appointing their own successors on their deaths,) controlled the economic destiny of the city deciding which projects would be bonded.  During the Flood of 1927 when many New York investment entities expressed concern about New Orleans being devastated by a rising river, the Board of Liquidation decided on a public demonstration to quell fears (even though the Mississippi River would breach its banks long before it reached New Orleans.)  The levee was to be dynamited South of New Orleans at Poydras, flooding St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  With the world press on the scene the first dynamite blast did not dislodge the levee.  It took numerous blasts over the next few days before a breach could be effected. The 12,000 evacuated inhabitants were promised compensation, but were ""stiffed,"" officials even deducting the costs of temporary food and shelter from the final paltry settlements (now I understand what seemed like a perpetual distrust of New Orleans from our neighbors down South.)  We even see that with the expanded Port of New Orleans authority into Plaquemines Parish currently under consideration by the state legislature in this year's session, vociferously objected to by Plaquemines Parish politicos.  Also, there is still that Canary Island ""Isleno"" attitude.  The 19th century Canary Island migration to Plaquemines Parish brought with it an attitude that someone was always out to ""get us.""  The Canary Islands went through many economic upheavals.  They were principal exporters of wines in the 17th and 18th centuries until some blight destroyed their vines.  Then they went into dye production in the 19th century with certain insects endemic to the island, maintaining a monopoly until those ""damned"" Germans invented artificial dyes.  After that many Canary Islanders subsisted on remittances from family members who had out migrated to among other places, Plaquemines Parish.

I only had one quibble with this documentary.  In describing the development of the port as an entrept in the early 19th century, the narrator (Jeffrey Wright,) explained that at this time the port received shipments of bananas and coffee from Latin America.  The first commercial shipment of bananas did not arrive in the United States until shortly after the Civil War (and then at one of the northern ports.)  Another anachronism was the description of grain shipments and manufactured goods coming down the Mississippi to New Orleans at the same time.  Otherwise, a fine production with some interesting ""talking"" heads.",1213488000,8,3027,5.3906581740976645
2794358,5,B000OCY654,"This is one of the best New Orleans documentary I've ever seen and I've seen many.  This one captured the essence of the place and made me really want to go there.  In fact, while watching it, I felt as if I were already there.  If you're interested in checking out some Documentaries of New Orleans I would highly recommend you ad this to your list.",1207612800,3,350,4.2727272727272725
8184704,5,B000OCY654,"I watched this DVD recently to gain a better understanding of the history and culture of New Orleans, a city that I love and have visited before. PBS does an outstanding job in this video of detailing the nuanced history of the city, its roots in Creole, French, Spanish and other cultures over time. I especially liked the segment detailing the rise of Jazz music as being arguably the only real American musical culture, a music developed in New Orleans. A great DVD to get for anyone who is interested in learning more about the Crescent City",1518307200,,545,4.628865979381444

8184708,3,B000OCY654,This DVD was ok.  It did give a detailed history of New Orleans.  I think I was looking for something a little different however but still worth watching.,1403740800,,154,4.464285714285714
8184709,4,B000OCY654,"Yes this was a VERY well done documentary. However, I was expecting more about the early years. Like the Battle of New Orleans and the city's part during the Civil War. But, in all fairness, this was a two hour program and it's difficult to cover the history of a city so rich in culture and history in that amount of time.  So 4 stars for being a great program and one star off because of what I would have preferred in the story.",1400630400,2,431,4.130952380952381
8184710,5,B000OCY654,I ordered this for research purposes. It blazes through a lot of the history of the town things that I've read in more detail in books. But I would expect that as it's hard to cover EVERYTHING. Plus the director does state in the added extras that a lot of information was lost or hard to come by in the time after Katrina. Either way it was a very interesting and informative doc. I'm happy to have purchased it as I will refer back to a few things more times that if I had rented it. Exactly what I would expect from a PBS show.,1395878400,,530,4.057142857142857
8184711,2,B000OCY654,hoping to see major attractions in New Orleans - obviously ordered wrong DVD - this was a history about blacks in New Orleans - disappointed,1390953600,,140,4.64

8184713,5,B000OCY654,Great DVD about the History of New Orleans. Very accurate. I would recommend this if you love New Orleans as much as I do!,1384992000,,122,4.125
