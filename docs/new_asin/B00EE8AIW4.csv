5909041,5,B00EE8AIW4,Love this documentary! Great resource for Spanish teachers. It covers many different ethnicities and topics. There's no other like it.,1387065600,2,134,5.75
5909042,4,B00EE8AIW4,"I am not Latino, but after Arizona outlawed studying about Mexican American history, glad to know information is slowly but surely becoming available.  I wish there had been more hard fact history about how Latino Americans have had to endure injustices, along with African Americans and Native Americans.  It is understandable that whites think they are the only major contributors to this country when American history books deliberately omit and distort the contributions of all other races.

 I also recommend the documentary ""A Class Apart"", which provides historical information about Mexican Americans and their treatment after the Mexican American war and how our government took their land and gave to whites or they were otherwise duped out of their assets.....talk about wealth and resource distribution. Have not been able to find any American history where land/resources were taken from American whites and given to Mexican Americans, Native Americans or African Americans.  Will continue to seek out and will post if I find it.",1384473600,30,1042,5.368098159509202
5909043,5,B00EE8AIW4,"This documentary gives an excellent overview of the history of Latino Americans, a term which incidentally can be confusing or at least thought-provoking because it looks so similar to ""Latin Americans,"" and also because the Spanish word ""americano"" (especially outside the United States) doesn't necessarily have the same range of meanings as the English word ""American."" Watching Latino Americans gave me a better understanding of the history of Latinos in this country, including familiarity with important leaders and how people have often faced very different circumstances in different regions. Also, I'm now more keenly aware of the historical factors behind much of my own family's story. Every American should watch this program!",1383782400,12,738,5.598214285714286
5909044,5,B00EE8AIW4,"I have yet to view the dvd, but I watched the series on PBS. This is just what I need to keep my Latino students interested in history. Looking at history through others eyes is the best way to teach history. This series brings to light a history so rich that my students even put away their phones to watch and listen.",1383609600,15,319,4.161290322580645
5909045,5,B00EE8AIW4,great history lesson for all us to learn I think we all need to learn about different peoples history today,1383523200,4,107,4.4
5909046,5,B00EE8AIW4,"First of all, I love history. I was reading a book from Howard Zinn and as I was doing some research about facts and dates I came up across this documentary. Great job from PBS making an effort to show what is the impact of the Latino community now days. I'm glad the Juan Gonzalez was interviewed and shared some of his extended knowledge in Latino studies(Writer of the ""Harvest of Empire"" and co-host at ""Democracy Now""). I hope young Latinos and Latinos of all ages take a couple of hours to enjoy this great piece( free on PBS.com), take pride of who you are and embrace your culture. Here you will learn about unknown Latino heroes who fought on World Wars, Labor organizers, politicians and more. I can't praise and say how much I loved it.

5909051,5,B00EE8AIW4,"This is a great documentary that helps you understand that you cannot label or stereotype a group of people in any way because of diversity. There is no single description or story that fits all Latinos or Hispanics in America. Anyone who thinks Latinos should ""go home"" does not understand their own immigrant roots and that this land is our land too. We are already home.",1445040000,2,373,4.666666666666667

5909060,1,B00EE8AIW4,"History is the study of what actually was, and not what you want it to be. This documentary fabricates a ""Latino"" history that never existed.

What most people today don't realize, is that the ""hispanic/latino"" ethnic category is a recent fabrication that never existed before the 1970's. The reason there is scant mention of ""latinos"" in history books is because there was no such concept. No one was ever Latino before then.

Early Spanish settlers in Florida and New Mexico were European colonists...just like the English or the French; they were not ""Latinos"" in the way we understand that term today. They were oppressors, and not the oppressed; not part of some racial/ethnic minority group.

Mexicans, Puertoricans, Cubans, ect - who today we call ""latinos"" - in the past were completely unrelated immigrant groups, that were mostly all considered white legally (a status that mexicans fought for and won), and not subject to discriminatory race laws in segregated America.

Why were all of these Mexicans mentioned in the documentary allowed to attend white-only universities, and fight in white-only units of the army?  Because at the time, they were considered white.

This documentary tells a completely fabricated story, and the historical whiteness of the people we call ""latinos"" today is never mentioned - since that would undermine the premise of the whole documentary.",1415145600,4,1385,5.216216216216216

5909064,5,B00EE8AIW4,"I am so proud to be Mexican American, with a little Irish thrown in and who knows what else.  This story is very moving and opens the door to many sad, but historical facts.  I was very surprised to see a picture of my Mom in this video.  I was so proud of her just being a small part of WWII, but to see her as included in this awesome documentary...took my breath away.

5909077,5,B00EE8AIW4,"This is excellent in how it demonstrates not only the struggles of a people, but also their state of mind.  Latino culture at it's least is a combination of Native, African and Spanish, though only the Puerto Rican Latinos seem to acknowledge this openly, but all of Latin American cultures are this combination though each individuals percentage may vary.  Especially the contributions to Mexico that Afro Mexicans have made, from military, revolutionary and the arts, yet they are shown in photographs, but not mentioned.  I guess ""Raza"" means deny blackness?  Afro Mexicans such as Guerrero, Morales, and Zapata are just a few, and the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles in California benefited tremendously from Afro Mexicans, that always sought to end ethnic prejudices.  At least in 2013 this documentary mentioned Mexican Native heritage.  The National Museum of Mexican Arts traveling exhibit of the African Presence in Mexico toured the U.S. in 2009/10 and on Youtube, yet these people and their contributions could not get a mention in the series.  This series is great to gauge what the browning of America may mean, if we heed the lessons that may also be glimpsed in a documentary ""A Class Apart"", where it appears that Mexican American elite, had argued that they were white, and some of that influence may still be a factor in the culture.  The 5th show is excellent for showing why Civil Rights/Human Rights battles that typically are always framed as struggles of White against Black, should be changed and more inclusive.  Why should there be separate documentaries for other non white people that fought to change our country during that era also?  There were excellent Latino leaders in this struggle, that blew me away.  East coast Latino struggles were noticeably missing in this 5th segment, and possibly these can get exposure one day. There is also the use of Anglo to possibly replace white, which is in conflict with other proud non Anglo-Saxon European heritages such as the Irish (The Kennedy's). This was annoying at times. Excellent series for those with blinders on, and need some serious lessons about where the U.S. may be headed, and those trying to understand where they came from.",1388275200,10,2218,5.0
