4582630,3,B00561BMXC,"Gavin (Charlie Hunnam) is a faithless jumper on a ledge. Terrence Howard plays Hollis, a police officer whose job it is to talk him down. The story as to how he got to the ledge is a flashback and the main part of the movie. This is interrupted by scenes of Hollis confronting his wife, which we don't know if these are flashbacks or if this is something he is thinking about doing.

Gavin is a hotel manager. His roommate is a gay Jew and HIV positive. Liv Tyler plays his mousey neighbor married to an unlikable Christian who wants to convert gays and atheists. Liv gets a job working for Gavin, who wants to liberate her from Mr. Joe Christian. I grew weary of the stereotyping of both Christians and atheists before this thing was half over... Catholics burn in hell and atheists are atheists because of some event in their life to make them hate God. Later the movie deviates from the stereotypes. Christians are not always good and atheists are not always bad. They are both human. Ho-hum.

Joe Christian treats his wife like dirt. Liv Tyler tells a far fetched story on how she met Joe, who as it turns out is a bit psychotic. The movie starts out slow and draws you in to where you have to see what happens. It doesn't make any definitive statement about God or atheism.

4582631,4,B00561BMXC,"Matthew Chapman both wrote and directed this film that relates a fine little suspense thriller along with an ongoing debate between atheism and fundamental evangelical Christianity.  As back ground it is of interest to note that Chapman has written two books - 'Trials Of The Monkey - An Accidental Memoir', an account of the Scopes Trial told in the form of a road trip Chapman took to the town where the trial took place, along with a memoir of his childhood growing up as a descendant of Charles Darwin, and '40 Days and 40 Nights - Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities On Trial in Pennsylvania', that tells the story of a small town ripped apart when fundamentalism and science came in conflict. It is obvious that Chapman is concerned about the dichotomy of faith and belief in God and the polar opposite, atheism: this theme is an important part of the impact of the story of THE LEDGE - a title that not only explains the place where the tale takes place but likely also explains the stance of Chapman in the process of deciding his own belief system.

The film begins with a young man Gavin running up to the top floor of a building to stand on a ledge in order to commit suicide.  A policeman is assigned to talk him down: the story is told in flashbacks. Gavin Nichols (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable guy who is in hotel management. Quite by accident he encounters a beautiful but shy Shana (Liv Tyler) on the bus only to discover that Shana is applying for work at this hotel as a housekeeper to make extra money to afford school. There is an attraction but Shana quickly lets Gavin know that she is married: her husband Joe (Patrick Wilson) is a evangelical fundamentalist who orders his and Shana's life according to Bible teachings. By chance Shana and Joe live in the same apartment building and the same corridor as Gavin: Gavin's roommate Chris (Christopher Gorham) is gay and is HIV positive and Gavin has taken him in when his family and friends deserted Chris.  Joe and Shana invite Gavin and Chris to dinner where it becomes painfully obvious that Joe, thinking that both men are gay, finds their lifestyle abominably sinful. There is a fiery discussion about Gavin's disbelief in the things Joe believes in. Gavin leaves in disgust but the gentle Chris stays a bit longer until he discovers that Joe wants to convert him so that he can change his life and avoid damnation.

Gavin and Shana have an affair, Joe learns about it, and threatens Gavin that by noon either he will kill Shana or Gavin can jump to his suicide death. We gradually discover Shana's dark background which explains why she stays with Joe and Gavin's equally tortured background which explains why he has lost all semblance of faith and only sees the need to care for his fellowman. And we learn that detective Hollis (Terrance Howard) assigned to talk Gavin down from the ledge has his own personal failure to have faith due to newly discovered challenges to his concept of his home life.  It is this struggle among the five characters and the way that destiny has thrown them together that brings a very surprising end to this film.

There is a lot to digest in this tense drama.  At times the role of fundamental religion threatens to over take the film (Patrick Wilson plays his role of a reformed sinner to the hilt), but due to the cautious writing of the script combined with the spot on acting skills of each of the five leads the audience is left to draw their own conclusions about the atheism/ fundamentalism debate.

4582687,2,B00561BMXC,"Supposedly a thriller, The Ledge takes so long to unwind that it ends up bordering on tedious. (All the actors are nice to look at, so I added a star.) The entire plot is based on a reveal exposed at the movie's end that, if Charlie Hunnam's character had told the cop (Terrence Howard) a few hours earlier, it would have obviated this whole boring mess. What a moron! Each character is assigned a cookie-cutter past tragedy that only appears to affect them at the time they recite it (the sole exception being Howard's on-going family turmoil--but that's precipitated by a totally implausible medical diagnosis). And does it really make sense that Hunnam's character, who confesses his own well-orchestrated plot to seduce the wife of his borderline-psychotic fundamentalist neighbor, would then be willing to die for her? Even Hunnams's gay, HIV-positive roomy (the normally skilled, TV-ubiquitous Christopher Gorham) finds love, beds, and then proposes marriage to some guy within what seems like a few weeks--and then he's crestfallen when his Rabbi won't marry them! Reality takes a vacation. Fortunately I didn't pay a lot for this DVD, or you might see me standing on that ledge.",1440720000,,1186,5.0561224489795915

At first I thought I was getting wrapped up in some pseudo-religious film but this turned out to be one really amazing segment of a terrific movie. On the DVD cover it says ""one life, one choice, one step. There are so many lessons in this well done movie that it is hard to explain. A man of few beliefs (Charlie Hunnam) meets his neighbors very religious folk (Patrick Wilson and Live Tyler, married) while Charlie has a roommate who is gay and played wonderfully by Christopher Gorham. Charlie and Liv begin a torrid romance while Patrick learns of it and hates Charlies lack of love for God. Then we have Terrence Howard going thru his own stuff as a cop trying to talk Charlie off the ledge. I am a big Charlie Hunnam fan and he does not disappoint in this, BRAVO, Patrick Wilson is so scary ominous. Terrence Howard is wonderful and Chris Gorham is lovely.

4582709,2,B00561BMXC,"I watched this movie having no prior knowledge of it other than Charlie Hunnam was the star and, being that he is my current crush, I had to see it. After watching for about 10 minutes, 3 things were quickly apparent: the acting was bad, the writing was bad and its anti-religion (especially anti-Christian). First, the acting. It pains me to say it, but Charlie Hunnams acting was terrible in this movie. It seemed as if he knew the movie was going to be bad so he totally phoned it in on this one.  Liv Taylor was really awful although Ive never considered her good at acting so that wasn't a surprise. Two bright spots in the acting were Patrick Wilson as the crazy Christian and the wonderful Terrance Howard who is awesome in everything so that wasn't a surprise. The writing was horrible and laughable in spots. First the whole premise of the movie is ridiculous so theres that. Then there are some cringe-worthy scenes between Hunnam and Taylor which include an f-bomb laden proposition on a crowded bus. Never mind that hes her boss in the story but yes, women love to be wooed like that. NOT!!! Its clear the writer is a misogynist and he doesnt even try to hide it.  Then, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in the end were supposed to believe Charlies character will actually jump off a building to save a girl he basically just met and slept with only to piss off her husband? Ridiculous. Finally, theres the whole anti-religion thing. Ive seen a lot of reviews online rated WAY too high from people claiming this is an Atheist movie. I rather think its more an anti-Christian movie. The writer spent more time trying to demonize the Christians rather than supporting the Atheist argument. All we get in the movie for the Atheist viewpoint is, God doesnt exist because the tooth fairy doesnt exist and because bad things happen. Thats all youve got? Tired clich arguments for there is no God? I can understand that the Atheists want to have a movie to claim as their own but please, if there isn't another one out there, they should pool their money and have a decent one produced. This one is just too embarrassing to claim. Oh, and what I find super ironic are the two main themes we take away at the end: Self-sacrifice and forgiveness. Charlies character lays  down his life for a friend, and Terrance Howard forgives a rather large sin from his wife. Ironic because these are two of the biggest themes in Christianity. Save yourself the hour and a half.",1427328000,,2455,4.587699316628702
4582710,2,B00561BMXC,"Too many implausible things happen, the two protaganists don't feel like real characters, one so obtusely fanatic in his religious beliefs, the other a very easily offended atheist-feels like they took the basic premise and then STRETCHED it for a LONG long time. Didn't like the ending, it made no real sense. And to be honest about it, Spoiler ahead...

In real life NOBODY choses to die in order to save the life of someone who has been kidnapped-why would they believe that the lunatic (Joe) would not simply kill her anyway?  WHY didn't the guy just say immediately to the cop, ""A man is holding his wife hostage and will KILL her if I don't jump at such-and -such a time?""

4582720,4,B00561BMXC,"To start off - it was an interesting plot and something different than what I've seen before. A good take on adultery from a perspective that isn't always touched on.

Now, for a bit of constructive criticism - Charlie Hunnam's acting was mediocre. I found myself cringing whenever it was obvious he was trying to hide his British accent. To most, this is probably small potatoes, but to me, it pulled me from the drama unfolding on screen. It's the first thing I've seen him in, so I don't have much to compare him to, but I was not impressed with his acting. Wasn't too impressed with Liv Tyler's performance either, and I'm a pretty big fan of hers.

It is warranting a 4 star review solely for Patrick Wilson and Terrance Howard's showing of great acting. Both did a fantastic job in playing their parts - The cop who has learned some bad news about his own situation (won't spoil it) and a very religious man realizing the wife he helped from her own bad past has turned on him. Patrick Wilson is delightfully evil in a story that (eventually) will have you on the edge of your seat. The plot does take a while to progress and through most of the movie things move slow. Of course, without giving away too much, the very first scene makes you want to watch just to see what happens. I predicted the ending... but it is still shocking if you stick with it.

There are a couple of sex scenes that would not be appropriate for a kid to see and the language is harsh at times. Just a head's up if you want to know about those things.

Interesting plot - really wish Charlie Hunnam would've done a better job, but at least Patrick Wilson and Terrance Howard saved it. Other than that, I probably would've rated this lower than I have.",1422576000,,1734,4.375776397515528

I know of Charlie because I have so many women friends who are just crazy about him because of his part in Sons of Anarchy.  His acting in this movie makes me want to check that series out.  He was so easy as Gavin.  It was as though he understood his character inside and out.  You saw a man who started off playing a game, and ended up getting captured by it as the song goes.  I know Terrence Howard from many movies.  He can be quite controversial at times from his private life reports, but I would never say that this man is not a superb actor.  He acts as easily as the stride with which he walks.

Patrick Wilson as the born again zealot was amazing.  my heart broke for him when he stood outside Gavin's door and heard his wife in the throes of ecstasy because of another man.  And when he talked about his past life and his love for Shana you believed him and understood who he was as well.

4582764,3,B00561BMXC,"So that you know my point of philosophical origin, I'm a former orthodox Catholic that has been a non-believer for 25 plus years (during which time lightning bolts killed far more Christians than atheists).  This movie, which is sometimes screened at atheist support groups, is poorly done.

For starters, it sets up a straw man combat between a nutcase, hyper-controlling sexually inept fundamentalist who gives one the willies the first time you lay eyes on him, and a virile, witty, compassionate, tolerant atheist that can do no wrong.

Here's the deal:  with friends like the producers of this movie, who (as an atheist) needs enemies?  In real life, though I'm firmly convinced that religion is a net negative, I meet intelligent, humorous, compassionate, world-improving believers on a daily basis.  As a non-believer who regularly meets other atheist/non-believer types that have all of the above qualities, too.  A more fascinating story would be to use examples from real life (e.g. approx. 90% of Nobel Prize winners in science) that demonstrate that worth and faith are definitely not joined at the hip.  Atheists aren't all hipsters that can seduce Liv Tyler (gazing on her was probably the best part of the movie) with a glance or two.  Christians aren't all deranged.

I was, however, offended by how fake the dialogue was, how heavy-handed it was in presenting its message, and how completely obvious and ham-fisted the whole thing was. The writer clearly had a one-tracked mind and didn't realize that he was penning the equivalent of beating someone over the head with a chair.  Honestly, I saw a few Christian movies growing up and this one would fall right in line with them in terms of the sheer level of self-righteous posturing, shallowness, and preachiness.

The worst part is that the movie's structure and pacing are also poorly executed so that the narrative becomes a choppy mess.  My guess is that someone decided to put the guy on the ledge in the first few minutes in the hopes that it would keep audiences interested long enough to endure the torture that the rest of the movie is. Because of the narrow focus of the writer, the characters are also bland and very stereotypical.  They are caricatures more than characters.

4582779,4,B00561BMXC,"The Ledge is an intense, thought-provoking, and engaging thriller written and directed by Matthew Chapman and starring Charlie Hunnam, Liv Tyler, Patrick Wilson, and Terrance Howard. I enjoyed it very much.

The ledge of the title refers both to the literal ledge on which we find our protagonist, Gavin, played with edgy charm by Hunnam, at the movie's open and also the figurative ledge that we all walk on in life as we thread our way through the choices that will either send us plummeting to our doom or keep us on the path. In that sense, all four of the main characters are on a ledge as the movie begins and the tension comes from wondering if they will fall, jump, or continue on.

The characters are complex, well-written, and well acted. Even the ""bad guy"", Shana's husband Joe, is written with such depth and portrayed with such honesty of feeling by Wilson, that I actually almost felt bad for him. The relationship between Gavin and Shana, played with grace by Tyler, unfolds somewhat painfully as we watch a bad idea become something beautiful and very sexy. Finally, there's police detective Hollis, played competently by Howard. His job is to talk Gavin off the ledge, but he is a bit preoccupied with his own crisis, a situation to which I can completely relate.

One more shout-out to a minor character that eventually becomes very important to the story, Gavin's roommate Chris, well played by Christopher Gorham. I think in this character we have a reminder that sometimes the people who pass through our lives, seemingly on the sidelines, can end up being more important than we think, if only we stop to notice them.

Anyway, in case you need a two-by-four up the side of the head, this is a great movie. If it sounds like your cup of vodka, watch it soon. And please do not confuse it with the awful Asger Leth film Man on a Ledge (2012), which I had the misfortune to see in the theater when it first came out.",1375142400,3,1935,4.583815028901734

4582794,3,B00561BMXC,"There have been some number of ""issue"" movies over the years. This is better than average, but just a bit.

Here's the scoop. Gavin (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable, easy going hotel manager. He gets new neighbors in his building, Shana and Joe Harris (Liv Tyler and Patrick Wilson). It's realized right off the bat that Gavin and Joe are on opposite sides of the ""God"" issue, and as Gavin finds himself uncontrollably drawn to Shana the issue is brought to its extreme with Gavin finding himself on a tall ledge poised to jump.

I like this kind of movie because I'm drawn to these kinds of arguments. Writer/Director Matthew Chapman is clearly siding with Gavin, but shows good reason why Joe and Shana are so strongly religious. The four principal characters, Gavin, Joe, Shana and detective Hollis Lucetti (Terrence Howard) who is trying to talk Gavin off the ledge, all have or had life altering problems in their lives. They merely chose different ways to re-emerge into the world. So the viewer does not want to slot them as me good you bad black and white. But finally how far will you go to defend your belief? Where is the line that you will not cross?

This is a good watch. Hunnam has a certain presence in front of the camera but he's got a rather narrow range as an actor. His role needed someone with much more gravity. I liked Wilson and Tyler a lot. I thought they handled their roles well. I find Howard not much better than Hunnam. I'm glad they switched him out for Don Cheadle in the ""Iron Man"" movies. But this all moves at a steady pace and you really want to know how Gavin will handle his deadline. I found the progression from the opening scene, where Gavin climbs out on the ledge, to the backtracking of how he came to be there, very satisfying. They did need more time with him and Howard squaring off, but that's a rather minor quibble.

Going in, I thought this would be about a desperate man on a ledge having an existential crisis, questioning religion and the meaning of life. In a flashback, we have a Theist and an Atheist discussing their beliefs. The Atheist's argument had a bite to it, but the Theist's rebuttals were calmly stated. I thought, finally, a movie that can rationally discuss faith differences without resorting to tired stereotypes.

I was wrong.

I should've guessed wrong by the early homophobia of the Theist, but I hoped to be surprised. When the Theist starts acting more crazy as the movie wore on, I knew this would be serving an Athiest's agenda. Instead of presenting both sides fairly and having you think for yourself, you'll be told what to think. This is true for the two other stories as well.

In one story, a wife betrays her husband's trust by purposely misleading him, but in her mind, she did him a favor. This ""favor"" was something he never asked for and actually treated him like a child who couldn't handle the truth.  None of that matters, though, because if the wife saw it as a favor, then you should, too.  You should, therefore, root for him to take his wife back and if he doesn't, then see him as ungrateful and overreacting (evident by the lecture he receives).

In the other story, a wife feels oppressed by her husband.  Instead of rooting for her to get a backbone, you should root for her to commit adultery.

In one scene, her affair partner's roommate walks in on them in bed.  When the roommate leaves, the affair partner reassures her saying, ""Don't worry, he's cool"". Right...because cool people understand the necessity of adultery, so they won't rat you out. Cool people understand that adultery liberates a woman...whereas uncool people see it as a contradiction to call yourself liberated if you're sneaking around and wearing a mask around your spouse.

You should also view this woman as kind, too. After all, she did express gratitude that her husband saved her and concern that if she ever left him, he might kill himself. However, if she was really THAT grateful, why not show gratitude by playing fair?  If she was so concerned he might kill himself, why commit the one act that, if caught, might cause a guy like that to kill himself?

I wasn't buying any of these messages.  The only bearable thing about this movie is seeing actor Charlie Hunnam, who's easy on the eyes. However, I fast forwarded through his sex scenes...not because I don't appreciate a hot sex scene...but because I don't find adulterous sex scenes particularly hot. I guess I'm just not cool enough.",1364947200,8,2642,4.7527352297593

4582802,5,B00561BMXC,"Well done all the way. You can forget the characters today but you will see them again tomorrow for they are true to life. This movie shows the truth of where true morals come from and it is not from religions. All morals come from within the human animal, placed there at the first by evolution as a survival tool so we could live with other apes of our kind. Then we codified the morals into the first law that governed, controlled, influenced, and regulated a person's actions as well as systems to conduct the policy and affairs of a village, a state, or others organizations. Only tens of thousands of years  later did the religions incorporated some of these morals into their dogma. I know I went a long way to make my point but here it is: as this movie shows morals are only real when they come from within the person and not from the fear of being tortured for all of eternity if you don't follow a ""gods commands"".

It is not often that a movie show the truth of morals and who really have them.

4582808,4,B00561BMXC,"Matthew Chapman both wrote and directed this film that relates a fine little suspense thriller along with an ongoing debate between atheism and fundamental evangelical Christianity. As back ground it is of interest to note that Chapman has written two books - 'Trials Of The Monkey - An Accidental Memoir', an account of the Scopes Trial told in the form of a road trip Chapman took to the town where the trial took place, along with a memoir of his childhood growing up as a descendant of Charles Darwin, and '40 Days and 40 Nights - Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities On Trial in Pennsylvania', that tells the story of a small town ripped apart when fundamentalism and science came in conflict. It is obvious that Chapman is concerned about the dichotomy of faith and belief in God and the polar opposite, atheism: this theme is an important part of the impact of the story of THE LEDGE - a title that not only explains the place where the tale takes place but likely also explains the stance of Chapman in the process of deciding his own belief system.

The film begins with a young man Gavin running up to the top floor of a building to stand on a ledge in order to commit suicide. A policeman is assigned to talk him down: the story is told in flashbacks. Gavin Nichols (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable guy who is in hotel management. Quite by accident he encounters a beautiful but shy Shana (Liv Tyler) on the bus only to discover that Shana is applying for work at this hotel as a housekeeper to make extra money to afford school. There is an attraction but Shana quickly lets Gavin know that she is married: her husband Joe (Patrick Wilson) is a evangelical fundamentalist who orders his and Shana's life according to Bible teachings. By chance Shana and Joe live in the same apartment building and the same corridor as Gavin: Gavin's roommate Chris (Christopher Gorham) is gay and is HIV positive and Gavin has taken him in when his family and friends deserted Chris. Joe and Shana invite Gavin and Chris to dinner where it becomes painfully obvious that Joe, thinking that both men are gay, finds their lifestyle abominably sinful. There is a fiery discussion about Gavin's disbelief in the things Joe believes in. Gavin leaves in disgust but the gentle Chris stays a bit longer until he discovers that Joe wants to convert him so that he can change his life and avoid damnation.

Gavin and Shana have an affair, Joe learns about it, and threatens Gavin that by noon either he will kill Shana or Gavin can jump to his suicide death. We gradually discover Shana's dark background which explains why she stays with Joe and Gavin's equally tortured background which explains why he has lost all semblance of faith and only sees the need to care for his fellowman. And we learn that detective Hollis (Terrance Howard) assigned to talk Gavin down from the ledge has his own personal failure to have faith due to newly discovered challenges to his concept of his home life. It is this struggle among the five characters and the way that destiny has thrown them together that brings a very surprising end to this film.

There is a lot to digest in this tense drama. At times the role of fundamental religion threatens to over take the film (Patrick Wilson plays his role of a reformed sinner to the hilt), but due to the cautious writing of the script combined with the spot on acting skills of each of the five leads the audience is left to draw their own conclusions about the atheism/ fundamentalism debate.

4582811,4,B00561BMXC,"A police detective who has just received shattering personal news is dispatched to talk a potential jumper off a ledge, only to discover that the jumper HAS to jump or else someone he loves will die. Add to that immediately gripping opening scene some superb acting from all involved, as well as a strong & thought-provoking screenplay, and you've got a film well worth watching, and then discussing at length afterwards.

So why do some reviews call it too contrived & thus unwatchable?

I suggest that the current obsession with so-called ""realism"" in contemporary entertainment is to blame. Yes, the story is a bit stagey ... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ironically, for a film about atheism & fundamentalism at odds, it's very much like a Medieval mystery play, in which characters represent certain specific worldviews or aspects of human existence. In short, it's as much allegory as straight narrative. This was once an acceptable form of storytelling, as can be seen in quite a few films & TV shows from the 1950s & 1960s. Now, however, the emphasis on a rather generic & homogenized ""realism"" -- which is in fact just as contrived & artificial as any other form of storytelling in the end -- makes it difficult for some viewers to enter into the story & its ideas.

Don't let that deter you from seeing it, though. Unlike so many formulaic & empty film spectacles these days, ""The Ledge"" offers an intense story with well-rounded characters, as well as plenty of ideas to grapple with: ideas about faith, about belief, about love, about self-sacrifice, about the meaning of life (or whether there is any such meaning at all). Again, the characters are in part allegorical ones ... but they're also recognizable individuals, with painful & complex backstories that make us sympathize with them, even if we don't share their particular worldviews.

So, the film's approach might put off some viewers who aren't comfortable with its style of storytelling. But if you can give yourself over to it, you'll find yourself fascinated by the lives of its characters & the terrible choices they must make ... and you'll most likely wind up thinking about your own beliefs & the choices you make everyday, as well. That's rare to find in film today, which is what makes this one so refreshing & striking -- highly recommended!",1332633600,6,2335,4.85929648241206
4582812,2,B00561BMXC,"* * * SPOILER ALERT * * *

I admit that I was expecting a lot.  This is one of those limited-release, independent films that people like me never hear about unless someone tells us or we read about it somewhere.  I heard it mentioned on the ""Point of Inquiry"" podcast, which usually features fairly intelligent and rigorous commentators.  And the director being Charles Darwin's great-grandson was an interesting bit of trivia.

As others have pointed out, the script was clunky and most of the actors were either monotone, or unconvincingly emotional.  The religious discussions were about at the level one would find at a junior high school lunch table.  The film was hyped as significant because of the atheist leading character, but it was implied that he had lost his faith because of his daughter's senseless death.  Even as an atheist myself, I have scant respect for people who become atheists after some personal tragedy - as if the tragedies of others are unimportant, but as soon as something happens to them personally, suddenly they are ready to abandon their faith.  The Christian character doesn't come off any better here, either; the existence of pain and evil in a world supposedly created by a benevolent diety has been addressed by many religious writers through the ages.  There was no shortage of reasonable responses that the character could have given, but instead we get nothing, as if no one had ever noticed this before or found it to be a problem.

One trend I despise is the use of the violent and insane white Christian fanatic.  A character of this type was the villain in the 6th season of ""Dexter,"" and I am afraid that it is going to be a stock bad guy for a while.  Yes, I know about Charles Manson and Tim McVeigh and Anders Breivik.  But you can find those extremes within any group.  The husband is presented not as a killer who happens to be a Christian white guy; he is a killer because he is a Christian white guy.  I find this presentation offensive, and can hardly wait until people tire of it and move onto some other target.  It's just as bad as ""Jew Suss.""  Despite the Dominionist-inspired rhetoric of Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, and their ilk, and even the laughable hate-mongering of Fred Phelps, there are no Christian armies anywhere in the world, much less in the U.S., attempting to establish a Biblical Theocracy.

Nevertheless, I can see the film's appeal to those who are interested in philosophical issues, but want it spoon-fed in easy doses.  For those who find films like Tarkovsky's ""The Sacrifice,"" or ""My Dinner With Andre,"" or even ""I Heart Huckabees"" overwhelming, ""The Ledge"" should do nicely.",1328745600,3,2664,4.762527233115469

This movie may not be the best film out there or even have the best dialog, but it does make you think and that in and of itself makes it worth 5 stars. Too often atheists are viewed in a negative light and while I don't agree with what his character did to cause him to be on the ledge I can see how it could've happened. The evangelical character also does an excellent job of portraying many things that are wrong with fanatical religious beliefs and what can happen when they are taken to the extreme.

4582825,3,B00561BMXC,"The Ledge is a pretty disappointing movie.  The previews lead one to believe that this is a must see, action-filled suspense, but... the suspense isn't actually *there* most of the time.  Oh sure, when you see a guy standing on a rooftop and threatening to jump, your instict is to think ""I bet this movie's going to be edge of your seat nonstop excitement!"" but... it's not.  At least not my version of what makes a movie suspenseful.

You're probably also wondering WHY the guy is considering taking his own life.  There must be a bunch of different possibilities.  Maybe he's a wanted murderer?  Maybe he's part of a terrorist group and he turned against them, so now they're threatening to kill him?  Maybe he just had one of those days where he woke up on the wrong side of the bed and he's sick and tired of everything?  Nah, it's nothing like that.  What the reason is actually makes for a *very* slow-moving, uninteresting, and mediocre film overall.

The *exact* reason the man is threatening to jump from a building won't be spoiled, so I'll just mention what the storyline is about.

It's about a religious man and an atheist getting into constant arguments over who's right.  Now I admit, some of these arguments provide some insightful questions.  For example, the scene where the religious man explains what he had to say to a little girl who was dying on a hospital bed.  Unfortunately -like always- the atheist is portrayed as an arrogant know-it-all, and this really doesn't come as a shock to me.  In reality atheists aren't really anything like that (most of the time at least) but good luck telling Hollywood this.  However, at least in this particular case, this aspect DOES actually change and improve- eventually the atheist (the guy on top of the building played by Charlie Hunnam) actually has a sympathetic side, and a tragic life story to go along with it.

Basically Charlie's character strongly desires the woman portraying Liv Tyler but... she's unfortunately married to a psychotic man who takes his religious beliefs a bit too seriously.  He shares old-fashioned beliefs and believes that... well, nevermind.  I don't want to go against the promise I made above and spoil it.  I admit the final 15 minutes are pretty shocking and I didn't see the ending coming.

The bottom line is this- yes, it's compelling when a man threatens to jump from way up high, but this movie bases the ENTIRE storyline around this aspect, which means when Terrence Howard's character tries to communicate and rationalize with the man, instead we're treated to a storyline explaining how and why the man got to the point of suicide.

In other words, Hunnam's character is up there on the building telling his story for the entirety of the movie.  The story goes back and forth between the communication process of Howard and Hunnam's character and Hunnam's relationship with Liv Tyler for the entire movie, and... the reason it's a 3-star movie is because very little of this story contains compelling drama or suspense.

The movie's selling point is that a man wants to kill himself, but once we find out why -for me at least- it's a major disappointment.  That's the bottom line for me.  Maybe you'll like it, but for me?  Nah, it's severely lacking.  Watch at your own risk.",1326412800,,3287,4.757950530035336

The atheistic message is pronounced, but has everything to do with the story. Don't expect to be 'preached' at or anything, but the religious message is great. Being an atheist, I'm glad that a nonbeliever took center stage and the story was about the struggle between faith and rationality. The movie was wonderfully cast as well.

At the end, I had tears in my eyes. This was a powerful film about love and overcoming obstacles. This film may even make you view the world differently. And hey, the movie ended in a very unexpected way.",1325548800,10,623,4.553571428571429

I thought about the film for weeks afterwards.  I think that the characters are inexorably human:  They are either trying to escape the past, or are colliding with an even more unpleasant present, and the dialog was what humans actually say when faced with that kind of pain and those kinds of dilemmas.  Some reviewers disliked the dialog and acting, but I couldn't disagree more.  Predictable dialog and standard characters would have ruined the film and it would not have been as intriguing as it is.  The film has a kind of verisimilitude that one rarely sees.  Even the choice of location, a nondescript industrial town--rather than the standard gritty NYC or LA---was a stroke of genius.

I've seen controversial religious movies, but never an atheist flick (Religulous doesn't count as Maher proclaims staunch agnosticism in the film). *Mild Spoiler*-The best thing is that the question atheists hate most was posed about halfway through- ""Why do you hate god?"" I appreciate that the protagonist was portrayed as a human being and not as a baby eater.

4582844,3,B00561BMXC,"Here's what I don't understand: This was an extremely contrived story. So if you're going to stack the deck anyway, why stack it so it comes up with a pair of tens? I mean, if you're going to stack it, stack it for crying out loud. I actually think he (meaning director Matthew Chapman) wrote the Christian characters as more interesting and sympathetic than he did the lone atheist one.

Oh, and why not let the atheist character have some interesting atheist friends? And why imply that his atheism is at least largely dependent on a personal tragedy that befell him (rather than, say, a process of intellectual doubt)? Maybe Chapman was trying to bring in more authenticity by having the point of view he was espousing be so flawed, but since he was actively promoting--OBVIOUSLY actively promoting--atheism anyway, why not at least make the character less of a douche?

And the writing and acting were both mediocre. Not horrible. Just bad enough that the combined mediocrity was enough to make me wince. If either the writing had been so sparkling as to have been all but bad-actor-proof, or the acting rose above the material, it might have been almost good. As it is, just one more embarrassment for my people.

But OK...it probably is not actually any worse than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fireproof/dp/B001KEHAFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fireproof</a>&nbsp;or ""Courageous."" I just expect more from atheists than I do from Christians. We supposedly have all these brilliant, dead clever ""free thinkers,"" and then this is the best we can come up with?

No wonder most Americans care no more for ultimate questions than they do, with the issue's best representatives on either side talking past each other or engaged in making dreadful, amateur propaganda rather than lasting art.

And from the whiskey-tango-foxtrot files: The bonus features contain interviews with Chapman and the actors, but they are held in noisy hallways and outside on tops of buildings with loud construction work and traffic sounds in the background.  Supremely distracting.  And at several points Chapman says, ""Let's start again,"" but nothing is edited out.  On one hand, this is admirable--maybe he's trying to show a little of that ""warts-and-all"" integrity of the scientific method embodied by his great-grandfather, Charles Darwin.  But on the other hand, the impact on the viewer is of further amateurism, as if the features were part of some high school project.

I give it three stars for one reason: ""The Ledge"" at least has the boldness of vision to demonstrate that interesting philosophical issues can be presented in a compelling format, using a fictional narrative.  G.K. Chesterton did this very well for his worldview, Roman Catholicism, in stories such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Was-Thursday-Centennial-Edition/dp/1449508863/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Was Thursday: Centennial Edition</a>.  While I think that there are several top-drawer atheist artists and storytellers (Joss Whedon and Philip Pullman come to mind), we have a ways to go before we master the art of cogent storytelling, intent on making a point by bringing characters and situations and ideas to life.

Having pounded on with almost relentless criticism, there are moments that gesture toward the movie that might have been, and it would have been gripping.  I hope that Chapman, having returned to filmmaking after a hiatus, will continue to attempt what has not yet been accomplished: making a case for not just the rationality of atheism, but the profoundly positive experience of it.",1317686400,4,3681,5.480565371024735

What I liked: Thought-provoking questions about atheism and Christianity. What happens when the two fight head-to-head? The soundtrack was beautiful.

What could have been improved: The dialogue felt a bit forced. Cinematography left a bit to be desired.

The Ending: I was a bit disappointed by the ending, but it made a profound statement.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie. It opened a pathway of communication between my husband and I about our differing beliefs. (He's a Catholic. I am an atheist.)",1317427200,6,933,7.682242990654205
4582846,2,B00561BMXC,Its a very predictable film with a wrong ending. There is much dialogue showing the dangers of the christian faith and the dangers of dying for your beliefs. The poor ending certainly damaged the film greatly when it was not necessary. In  the end everyone lost so there was no feel good factor after.

It has two main plots, an atheist being blackmailed to kill himself and a policeman trying to both save him and get his life together. I actually found the policeman's story more interesting. It was supposed to be a story of a fundamentalist Christian vs an atheist, but actually, it was a story of two nice guys both faced with major decisions. For all the philosophical debate in the movie, you could have switched the two characters with no major loss to the story.

The acting was reasonable. I did like Terrence Howard performance. The filming was good enough.",1316131200,5,636,4.628318584070796

movie that you watch because of the cast and end up being blown away.
While the movie is a little slow in parts the message, acting and plot
are great. All four main characters in this movie are all conflicted
and each have their own choice to make in order to move on with their
lives and it is intriguing to watch all of them handle it. At it's core
this is a movie about faith and morals and will leave you questioning
yourself as to what you would do in each position. That is the sign of
a good movie, one that makes you look at yourself in a way you may not
have before. Overall, I highly recommend this movie. More movies should

4582850,4,B00561BMXC,"Matthew Chapman both wrote and directed this film that relates a fine little suspense thriller along with an ongoing debate between atheism and fundamental evangelical Christianity. As back ground it is of interest to note that Chapman has written two books - 'Trials Of The Monkey - An Accidental Memoir', an account of the Scopes Trial told in the form of a road trip Chapman took to the town where the trial took place, along with a memoir of his childhood growing up as a descendant of Charles Darwin, and '40 Days and 40 Nights - Darwin, Intelligent Design, God, OxyContin, and Other Oddities On Trial in Pennsylvania', that tells the story of a small town ripped apart when fundamentalism and science came in conflict. It is obvious that Chapman is concerned about the dichotomy of faith and belief in God and the polar opposite, atheism: this theme is an important part of the impact of the story of THE LEDGE - a title that not only explains the place where the tale takes place but likely also explains the stance of Chapman in the process of deciding his own belief system.

The film begins with a young man Gavin running up to the top floor of a building to stand on a ledge in order to commit suicide. A policeman is assigned to talk him down: the story is told in flashbacks. Gavin Nichols (Charlie Hunnam) is a likable guy who is in hotel management. Quite by accident he encounters a beautiful but shy Shana (Liv Tyler) on the bus only to discover that Shana is applying for work at this hotel as a housekeeper to make extra money to afford school. There is an attraction but Shana quickly lets Gavin know that she is married: her husband Joe (Patrick Wilson) is a evangelical fundamentalist who orders his and Shana's life according to Bible teachings. By chance Shana and Joe live in the same apartment building and the same corridor as Gavin: Gavin's roommate Chris (Christopher Gorham) is gay and is HIV positive and Gavin has taken him in when his family and friends deserted Chris. Joe and Shana invite Gavin and Chris to dinner where it becomes painfully obvious that Joe, thinking that both men are gay, finds their lifestyle abominably sinful. There is a fiery discussion about Gavin's disbelief in the things Joe believes in. Gavin leaves in disgust but the gentle Chris stays a bit longer until he discovers that Joe wants to convert him so that he can change his life and avoid damnation.

Gavin and Shana have an affair, Joe learns about it, and threatens Gavin that by noon either he will kill Shana or Gavin can jump to his suicide death. We gradually discover Shana's dark background which explains why she stays with Joe and Gavin's equally tortured background which explains why he has lost all semblance of faith and only sees the need to care for his fellowman. And we learn that detective Hollis (Terrance Howard) assigned to talk Gavin down from the ledge has his own personal failure to have faith due to newly discovered challenges to his concept of his home life. It is this struggle among the five characters and the way that destiny has thrown them together that brings a very surprising end to this film.

There is a lot to digest in this tense drama. At times the role of fundamental religion threatens to over take the film (Patrick Wilson plays his role of a reformed sinner to the hilt), but due to the cautious writing of the script combined with the spot on acting skills of each of the five leads the audience is left to draw their own conclusions about the atheism/ fundamentalism debate.

It would have been a more welcome portrayal, and still as dramatic a film, if the main character did not feel the need to inflict his views on all others.  I found it hard to be sympathetic with a character that had no respect for the faith of others.  I may not believe, but I certainly respect the fact that most others do and wound not appreciate my pointing out the flaws in their faith.  Of course, the film is not about me, but I do think the result would have been even more thought provoking if the fundamentalist was more realistic and the athiest was more respectful.

8459036,2,B00561BMXC,"An all-star cast isn't everything, as proven by the independent drama, The Ledge. The film features, (big surprise) a man on the ledge of a building, threatening to jump, and when the police negotiator shows up, the man (Charlie Hunnam), through flashbacks, tells a twisted tale of love, adultery, and murder that led him to his current predicament. One of the biggest problems I have with this films is Charlie Hunnam, he was so good as outlaw biker, Jax Teller, on seven seasons of Sons of Anarchy, that I don't really buy him as this sweet, emotional guy. Not to mention the fact that he had better chemistry with Terrance Howard, who played the police negotiator, than he did with Liv Tyler, the woman he was supposedly willing to risk everything for. Together, Hunnam and Tyler seem almost uncomfortable and it wasn't just while they were talking. All of their interactions are awkward, clumsy, and uncomfortable to watch, something I assure you was not done on purpose. Aside from that, the story here, isn't even that great, The Ledge is more talking then anything else, yes I realize it's a drama, but something has to happen at some point doesn't it? I mean the endless talk is broken up by a couple of clumsy sex scenes and then it's back to talking, I really found the whole thing to be very boring, and apparently so did other Netflix viewers, as it was streaming for about two weeks before they pulled it. As I said before, the Ledge has a great cast, but besides that it's just another long, tedious, film you can live without.",1478563200,,1541,4.627737226277373

Only problem is, Shana is married to an uber conservative and controlling (please excuse my redundancy) husband name Joe (Pat Wilson).  She feels she ""owes"" Joe for saving her, but she does not love him.  Nonetheless, she doesn't want to hurt Joe.  When Joe finds out about the affair, he tells Gavin he must jump off a tall building a noon, else he will murder Shana.

The detective who is sent to talk Gavin down is Hollis (played by Terrance Howard).  Unfortunately, he is trying to deal with his own familial problems while simultaneously trying to talk Gavin out of committing suicide.  He is @ far less than 100% emotionally to be able to cope with these travails......but he does his best anyway.

It sure is great to see Liv Tyler again as I have not seen her in anything since her last LORD OF THE RINGS movie.  She has a demure beauty that absolutely captivates me.  What's better is that she strips down for the 1st time since early in her career (STEALING BEAUTY).  Welcome back, Liv!  Charlie Hunnam is not a household name but he's an up & coming Thespian.  He's also one lucky dude as he has done love scenes with Liv in the present film as well as Olivia Wilde in DEADFALL.

This is a thought provoking movie which delves into the dark side of religion.  On a personal note, Gavin's story of transitioning from Christianity to atheism recapitulates my own journey as I crossed the Rubicon into the atheistic paradigm.  The insufficiency of religion to provide answers as well as the gross hypocrisy of holier-than-thou Christians drives me nuts.  In truth, I've not looked back across to the other shoreline in many yrs.  It does not interest me, just as it does not interest Gavin.

If you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie, then I can safely say this isn't it.  This is about life:  unvarnished & unfiltered.  It can get ugly.",1466208000,3,2002,4.606232294617564
