3060228,4,B00114XLRS,"A nice surprise here, as ""The Mayor of Hell"" is a pre-Code noir-ish film starring the always entertaining Cagney.

It's got a little bit of organized crime mixed with a little bit of reform school melodrama, and it totally works!

The DVD comes from a decent print, and it was easy to get involved in this little seen gem.

The plot ambles along briskly, and the performances are universally fine considering the era. Cagney lights up the screen as usual, but the school kids shine brightly as well. So much so that you don't miss the ""big movie star"" when he not on the screen.

This is a terrific way to spend an hour and a half on a lazy afternoon...",1217635200,,653,4.371900826446281
3060229,4,B00114XLRS,The only reason I got this movie was we caught the beginning on AMC and had to leave before it was over. I am basically collecting his musicals. After watching it from beginning to end I have to say I am not sorry I got it. It is a good story and shows how you can turn kids around by treating them with respect. It also shows how someone can really screw up their life by making the wrong choices. It's worth seeing.,1215475200,2,417,4.036144578313253
3060230,3,B00114XLRS,"Warner Brothers were famous for their social dramas and this time it is reform schools. Released in 1933, ""The Mayor of Hell"", is a forceful pre-code melodrama which exposes the cruelty and neglect doled out to the inmates of a reformatory, teenagers who invariably return to society as hardened criminals due to the inhuman treatment they receive. The film is really a starring vehicle for the magnetic Frankie Darro as the hoodlum who fights the system but James Cagney officially stars as a gangster politically appointed as governer of the reform school. Cagney clearly gives the film box office appeal but the balance of the drama is awkward as his part was obviously built up. MGM's Madge Evans plays a crusading nurse and although she is competent, she lacks the realism that Joan Blondell, for example, might  have brought to the part. The film builds to an exciting though predictable climax and Dudley Digges is a very convincing villian.

The print of the DVD is excellent and there are some entertaining extras, the best being a good commentary which particularly highlights the censorship issues which plagued the film. ""Warner's Night at the Movies"" is included but unusually, both the short film and the cartoon are dreary. This is probably the least interesting film included in the Warner's Gangster Set Volume 3.",1209168000,4,1330,5.013574660633484

3060244,5,B00114XLRS,"The Mayor of Hell is an outstanding pre-Code movie--and it's underrated, too! The acting by all is very convincing and the sets, along with the choreography and cinematography, all impresses me very much. The plot moves along at a good pace; I was never bored nor did the action move so fast that I couldn't keep up with it. The stereotypes in the film of Jews, Italians and African-Americans must have seemed rather benign at that time but we cannot edit these out and pretend these biased beliefs never existed.

When the action starts (and there's plenty of it), a gang of young thugs is already on the wrong side of the tracks, stealing candy and charging people to ""watch"" their cars for twenty-five cents, breaking car windows and more if people don't cough up the money. They are eventually sent to a reform school with the most heartless warden named Thompson (Dudley Digges). However, (somewhat) reformed gangster Patsy Gargan (Jimmy Cagney) gets a political favor and becomes ""Deputy Commissioner;"" Patsy intends to go to that reformatory, look it over--and then when he sees that the boys are being terribly mistreated, Patsy insists on being made the head of the reform school much to Thompson's chagrin. Patsy also comes to the reformatory with his gangster pal Mike (Allen Jenkins) and Mike's girlfriend played by Sheila Terry.

It isn't long before things at the reform school become much more civilized and sophisticated. Patsy takes his cue from Nurse Dorothy Griffith (Madge Evans) who believes in empowering the young men with a democratic approach so they learn with their own economy and court system--the kids get better food and a big ego boost, too! This enrages Thompson who is being upstaged; Thompson desperately wants to ruin Patsy's reputation so that he can go back to being the head of the reformatory.

Thompson sees his chance to make Patsy look rather unsavory when he realizes that Patsy is a former gangster who still has ties to the gangster world. When Thompson makes his move to discredit Patsy it sets off a chain of very unexpected events that will move and stun you.

There's already more to the plot than I've told you and I'll stop here to avoid giving out spoilers! I want you to watch and appreciate this film just as much as I did. Of course, the rest of the film shows how everything works out. Look also for solid performances by Arthur Byron as Judge Gilbert; Frankie Darro as Jimmy; Harold Huber as Joe; Edwin Maxwell as Louis Johnson; Sidney Miller as Izzy; Mickey Bennett as Butch and Raymond Borzage as Johnny.

The Mayor of Hell is an excellent film that dared to show people just how rotten the reform school system really was. Of course, Warner Brothers was able to do this because the film was made before the Hayes Code went into effect. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; people who appreciate gritty pre-Code dramas will not be disappointed.",1370217600,4,2926,4.763313609467455
3060245,4,B00114XLRS,"THE MAYOR OF HELL, a 1933 social potboiler, makes a decent timewaster. It stars James Cagney, even though he doesn't surface until 24 minutes in. And this time he's got a rival in generating that crackling intensity. Troublemaking teen actor Frankie Darro plays troublemaking teen Jimmy Smith, ringleader to an inner-city gang of juvenile hoods. After brutally hospitalizing a shop owner, the gang is nabbed and sentenced to Peakstown State Reformatory, a nasty reform school governed by a sadistic warden (Dudley Digges). Jimmy Smith's surly brand of moxie straight away plonks him in the warden's crosshairs.

Somewhen around here, Cagney shows his mug, playing a wiseguy named Patsy Gargan. Patsy's the newly minted Deputy Commissioner - ""a political job for services rendered,"" one fat cat winks. He's at the reform school on a routine visit, there only to scope things out as part of his new duties. Patsy doesn't really give a fig about conditions at the reform school. (""What do I have to do to make things look regular?"") But then he sets eyes on that bright-eyed crusading nurse, Miss Dorothy Griffith (Madge Evans). After Miss Griffith reluctantly gives him the scoop on what's what and who's crooked, Patsy sets out to expose corruption in Peakstown and to improve the boys' hellish plight. Boy, the things you do to get a date.

Spoilers now, I guess.

THE MAYOR OF HELL is a precursor to Humphrey Bogart's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-School/dp/B0026ZQJ1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime School</a>, not that that means anything to anyone not a devoted classic film buff. It reeks of social conscience and self-righteous melodrama. In Cagney and Darro, it pits two firecracker actors obliquely against each other. Darro's character actually has more of a grudge against Digges' heartless warden, and so Digges becomes the primary recipient of Darro's simmering rage. It's okay. Digges deserves it. He makes for a most hissable villain.

As the new administrator of Peakstown, Patsy imposes a radical system based on self-governing. In this new regime, juveniles are appointed by their peers to crucial command positions and allowed the run of the place (within limits). Did your jaw drop when Jimmy Smith gets voted in as ""Mayor?"" Neither did mine. Follows then the kids' ridiculously pain-free transition from embittered young hoodlums to stand-up citizens within the reformatory. But there's a nagging part of you that suspects this bit of d&eacute;tente to be an ephemeral thing. The depraved warden still lurks in the periphery, eager for the wind to shift. The books won't cook themselves. The whips regretably gather dust.

You can take Cagney out of the thug life, but you can't take the thug life out of Cagney. It's Patsy himself who screws the p00ch, his larcenous habits dumping him in dire straits, forcing him to go on the lam. His extended absence from Peakstown galvanizes the warden and triggers a brutal, shattering climax. Somewhere, William Golding must've seen this and had a notion.",1370131200,3,3069,5.306584362139918
3060246,5,B00114XLRS,"this is excellent. an early masterpiece.

3060248,5,B00114XLRS,"This is a black and white film, 90 minutes long, in dual-layer format.  A Warner Bros and Vitaphone Corp. presentation, The Mayor of Hell is a volitile blend of gangster and depression era passions.  Cagney plays gangster Patsy Gargan, a firey individual given the job as the manager or director of a woefully run boys reform school (for troubled youth.)  He runs up against plenty of problems in the mix, but he's up for the challenge and proves himself more than capable.  He sees himself in the faces of these kids, having been raised in the slums also.  When he decides to defy everyone to give the kids the opportunities he never had, all hell breaks loose and all the good Gargan does could collapse around him when he missteps into his life of crime.

Special Features include bonus movie trailers of the story-line linked ""Crime School"" (with Humphrey Bogart) and ""Hell's Kitchen,"" a vintage newsreel, a musical short ""The Audition"", a classic cartoon ""The Organ Grinder"" and a commentary by film historian Greg Mank.",1353974400,,1025,4.828571428571428
3060249,5,B00114XLRS,Although I prefer Cagney in more of a gritty role I really liked his performance in this movie. As my collection of his films grow I realize just how great of an actor he was.

3060250,4,B00114XLRS,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""THE MAYOR OF HELL"" (1933) (90 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring James Cagney, Madge Evans, Arthur Byron, Allen Jenkins, Dudley Digges & Frankie Darro

Directed by Archie Mayo

The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. Although Cagney is fine in the lead role as is Madge Evans the school nurse, the acting honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in.

There was Frankie Darro before the ""Dead End Kids"", he epitomized angry desperate youth during those early depression years. Here he comes across with his usual hot-headed intensity, enough to make up for a nonthreatening small size. Notice Darro acts a lot like a younger version of Cagney, which is no accident since the story line depends on Cagney seeing a lot of himself among the brutalized boys of the reform school. Darro plays Jimmy Smith, the leader of a street gang sent to a reform school for petty crimes. The courtroom scene where he is sentenced, tries to define the characters of these boys by explaining the cause of their delinquent ways, Smith is no good because his dad is no good and so on. Frankie Darro, who got into all kinds of on screen trouble during a brief tenure as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is a scene stealer  -- and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. No other kid actor during that era could touch him.

THE MAYOR of HELL is fast paced with tight direction and is still entertaining after all these years

3294745,5,B00114XLRS,"This is a black and white film, 90 minutes long, in dual-layer format.  A Warner Bros and Vitaphone Corp. presentation, The Mayor of Hell is a volitile blend of gangster and depression era passions.  Cagney plays gangster Patsy Gargan, a firey individual given the job as the manager or director of a woefully run boys reform school (for troubled youth.)  He runs up against plenty of problems in the mix, but he's up for the challenge and proves himself more than capable.  He sees himself in the faces of these kids, having been raised in the slums also.  When he decides to defy everyone to give the kids the opportunities he never had, all hell breaks loose and all the good Gargan does could collapse around him when he missteps into his life of crime.

Special Features include bonus movie trailers of the story-line linked ""Crime School"" (with Humphrey Bogart) and ""Hell's Kitchen,"" a vintage newsreel, a musical short ""The Audition"", a classic cartoon ""The Organ Grinder"" and a commentary by film historian Greg Mank.",1353974400,,1025,4.828571428571428

3294747,4,B00114XLRS,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""THE MAYOR OF HELL"" (1933) (90 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring James Cagney, Madge Evans, Arthur Byron, Allen Jenkins, Dudley Digges & Frankie Darro

Directed by Archie Mayo

The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. Although Cagney is fine in the lead role as is Madge Evans the school nurse, the acting honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in.

There was Frankie Darro before the ""Dead End Kids"", he epitomized angry desperate youth during those early depression years. Here he comes across with his usual hot-headed intensity, enough to make up for a nonthreatening small size. Notice Darro acts a lot like a younger version of Cagney, which is no accident since the story line depends on Cagney seeing a lot of himself among the brutalized boys of the reform school. Darro plays Jimmy Smith, the leader of a street gang sent to a reform school for petty crimes. The courtroom scene where he is sentenced, tries to define the characters of these boys by explaining the cause of their delinquent ways, Smith is no good because his dad is no good and so on. Frankie Darro, who got into all kinds of on screen trouble during a brief tenure as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is a scene stealer  -- and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. No other kid actor during that era could touch him.

THE MAYOR of HELL is fast paced with tight direction and is still entertaining after all these years

There's only one Cagney. And no one will ever replace him.

PS Tupac had good acting chops. Unfortunately the real gangster life (or at least his past gangster life)  took him. 25. Sad story. .",1488672000,,413,4.616438356164384
