Give this one a try even if you have not done any sort of exercise in a long time!  I started with this tape and have now lost 44 pounds and going strong!!!  Walk, Walk, Walk!!!",1247097600,,346,4.029411764705882
1851866,5,B00008LDZY,"I rented this video from the Library and I just love it. In it Leslie uses her Walk Away weight balls and it really adds extra intensity to burn off more calories and give balance, and she also has some neat moves that keep it going brisk and make it fun!! I highly reccomend this great workout!",1187308800,7,295,4.192982456140351
1851867,2,B00008LDZY,"So far, I have done 14 miles with this Leslie Sansone tape. Leslie has a good team to walk with, they are encouraging and happy I mean, but there is not one person besides Randy(in his 60's?) that is overweight or really needs to get fit! When you're walking for weight loss, seeing other people with the same goal really helps. Also,I have the walk away belt to use with the video, but over the miles about the only place that got in good shape is my legs and thighs. My abs did get a little slimmer, but it wasn't what I exspected at all. But one bonus was ever since walking more, my appetite has took a drastic turn around and I'm not as hungry any more. So I'm still looking for a Leslie Sansone video or DVD that will tone and slim my middle!",1171584000,,748,4.13013698630137
1851868,5,B00008LDZY,"I just finished working out to this new tape and I am very pleased with it. The quality is excellent. I do not have the Walk Away Belt, but use my stretchie band instead and it works great! It is an intense work out for 30 minutes and something most everyone can follow. Intense but not too intense. Go for it walkers!",1117065600,,318,4.145161290322581
1851869,2,B00008LDZY,This is  my 4th Sansone tape--I am not entirely pleased with it. The transitions in both music and pace are pretty shaky. The belt offers me little resistance--I use 2 pound hand weights instead.  This is my least favorite tape. I use it after the 3 mile or 3 mile walk tape.,1079568000,,275,4.269230769230769
1851870,4,B00008LDZY,"I HAVE 4 OF LESLIE'S FAT BURNING WALK AWAY THE POUNDS VIDEOS.I HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AND HAVE LOST 2 ENTIRE SIZES.THEY ARE EASY TO FOLLOW AND ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THEM FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS YOU CAN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TAPE AND REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE GOTTEN A GOOD WORK OUT.
I JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THE WALK AWAY THE POUNDS FOR ABS- 2 MILES. I DO THIS TAPE EVERY THIRD DAY TO BREAK UP THE POWER WALKING.
JUST ONE NEGATIVE COMMENT. SOME OF LESLIE'S TAPES NEED ADDITONAL EQUIPMENT (STRETCHIE BAND AND WALK AWAY BELT)THAT ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TAPE. ONCE YOU RECEIVE THE TAPE THEN YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE AND ORDER AT AN ADDITONAL COST EACH OF THESE ITEMS AND WAIT ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR DELIVERY.
BUT OVERALL, I AM HAPPY WITH HER TAPES AND LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THEM EACH AND EVERY MORNING.",1079308800,3,827,4.3076923076923075
7985409,4,B00008LDZY,Ive been looking for one of these and I love it. I only have a vcr at work so I can work out on my lunch break now. Seller was exceptional. Great service.,1518307200,,154,3.696969696969697
7985410,5,B00008LDZY,"This was a replacement for another one that I purchased a long time ago, and wore out!  Excellent workout.",1490054400,,106,4.578947368421052
7985411,5,B00008LDZY,"I have the VHS. This is a super tape. It does what it promises. My abs and waistline are shaping up, I can feel and see it. Also, my legs and thighs are really sliming and toning. Another thing no one mentioned. The bands, Slims, Tones, and SCULPT my SHOULDERS,  BUTT, arms, back, chest and under arms, spared me of having surgery. This is a complete body workout. I use my resistance bands. Just tie them around my waistline backwards, and workout with the gang. I tell everybody I know,  when fitness subject comes up. I tell them I'm going to the gym, when talking about the tapes, DVD etc. I exercise for now 3 times a week, religiously; CONSISTENCY  is the secret. I'm very confident that I'm doing what I can for my health sake and as a bonus I'm looking better than I've looked and felt in Years. Love the beautiful and encouraging remarks from people, and I love what I SEE. You/we owe it to ourselves. Just do it!!!!!!",1478390400,,927,4.377906976744186
7985412,5,B00008LDZY,I love Leslie and I love Walk Away the Pounds! I bought several of her videos together. This video is a great workout and I like having different choices to pop in and play for a new experience! :-D,1424649600,,198,4.102564102564102

7985415,5,B00008LDZY,"My grandmother used this tape for years, as she likes to stay in shape, and apparently she played it so many times that the tape wore out. I tried to convince her to switch to a DVD, but she prefers her old VCR so I bought her this VHS tape to replace her old copy. She's very satisfied with it and continues to work out with it daily, so though I can't vouch for it myself, I'd say it has earned five stars.",1357603200,,408,3.927710843373494
7985416,5,B00008LDZY,This is another good walking exercise with Leslie.  She always has a good workout that is easy to follow and brings results.,1354060800,,124,4.636363636363637
7985417,5,B00008LDZY,"I have become a follower of Leslie within the last year or so.  This 2 mile program is the one I use most often, either I do it on it's own or I add it to my weight training.  It's a nice little program, it's easy to follow and the time goes pretty fast and before you know it, you have walked 2 miles!  Living in a place that gets really cold in the winter, I don't have an excuse to not do my walks!

This walk is standard Leslie, you see the walking in place, side steps, knee lifts and kicks, she also adds double side steps and hamstring curls (kickbacks), along with assorted arm movements.  Later on in the program she and her walkers go grab their weighted balls.  There is one person who doesn't use them, so I always follow her as I do weight training separately.

Thanks to Leslie I am back to exercising, maybe not as consistently as I would like, but I am getting there.  Regardless, I am grateful to have found her workouts. They will hold a permanent place in my collection.",1256342400,,989,4.195767195767195
