2451501,5,B000C11M3G,I am not one to listen to a guy stand on camera and talk about how great a place is.  This video starts a little slow but gets going right away.  They have a great deal of flying.  Almost all the video is shot from the cockpit.  Good thing in my view.  The little talking they do is just to show what each spot has to offer and then back to the flying.  I really enjoyed this video and it is good to see these places before you go into them.  I understand it is not intended to be an instructional video but the quality and quantity of the content is very good.,1132272000,3,561,3.911504424778761
2451502,5,B000C11M3G,"I ordered this vid a few days ago and it showed up yesterday,

so we gathered around the TV during our normal ""Friday

night debriefing session"" and watched it. Great video!

We all had fun watching it (brought back good memories

of being there ourselves). Brought back sad memories too,

as we lost a friend there a few years back... The warning

on the tape saying to get instruction before you go ""play"" there

is not to be taken lightly...",1131926400,,444,4.475

8095008,4,B000C11M3G,"I bought this for my dad (a pilot who has flown to some of the ""easier"" airports on this video). We got a real kick out of the host and pilot of this video. He's an extremely competent pilot, but sometimes hard to hear. It's an amazing video. He lands in places where it's hard to tell that there is even a runway. I would definitely recommend.",1244073600,,344,4.149253731343284
8095009,4,B000C11M3G,"I think you have to be into flying to realy enjoy this homemade movie, and since I am I found it interesting.  The author lands at one airstrip after another and they get progressively shorter and more difficult.  The views are pretty incredible of Idaho wilderness and mountains.",1200873600,,280,4.8125
8095010,5,B000C11M3G,"It's hard to add much to the other reviews above, only confirm them. Having flown for a few years now this is something completely new. We don't have much bush flying up here in western NY needless to say, so this is really my first introduction as to what it's all about. We've all heard the term but I've learned a new appreciation for it now. I always knew the term meant putting an airplane into small places in the middle of nowhere but I always imagined somewhat of a visible airstrip. Oh, these are visible alright, like, after you've touched down maybe! The video does start out a little slowly but soon it progresses from nicely groomed, well established grass strips to ever more difficult places that represent more of a path than a strip. You seriously can't even see exactly where he's going to land on some of them until after you hear the stall horn and you've almost touched down. You think you're pretty good with an airplane? I'm amazed at the kind of places a plane can actually be landed (and still reused!) and learned a whole new appreciation for the term ""bush pilot"". The narration is just right, he doesn't overdo anything and he just lets the film speak for itself. This is a fascinating video with awe-inspiring scenery and let me tell you, this guy can fly!",1165881600,,1285,4.51931330472103
8095011,5,B000C11M3G,A must have for any pilot. A beautiful show of some of the Idaho No Return Wilderness area. Its amazing to watch the Skywagon get in and out of strips that would make most pilot cringe. Beautiful scenery coupled with a workhorse of a plane. This video has convinced me to get into a mountain flying school and head out next summer.,1154995200,,331,4.354838709677419
8095012,5,B000C11M3G,"Any pilot would appreciate seeing this video.  It is not an instructional video but just a day of flying into some of Idaho's bush country strips.  What is amazing is that the difficulty factor goes up on each successive strip visit.

Truly awesome but also enjoyable for anybody who loves the forest and back country trips.

Loved every minute of it.

8095013,5,B000C11M3G,"What a great DVD!! :-)) I viewed the first flights, and the tried them to refly in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 with a DHC2- Beaver and an HighRes DEM. Unfortunately I got lost on the first step from Johnson Creek to Big Creek ;-), what a labyrinth! *Don't tell anybody!* I used my GPS to find my way back to U60.

This DVD gives you a great opportunity to take a look into ""mountain flying"". If I could, I would give it 7 from 5 stars. :-))

8095014,5,B000C11M3G,"What a thoroughly enjoyable flying video!  I'm not a bush pilot so when I saw some of the landing strips featured I thought, ""You've gotta be kidding me"".  But Herb has such easygoing confidence and great technique (every touchdown is proceeded by a chirp of stall horn) that I knew if I ever had a chance to be his passenger I'd feel completely safe.

The other star of the show is the Idaho mountain country, a relatively unknown and certainly underappreciated part of the world.  Video work is excellent and allows the viewer to become immersed in the sighteeing and flying.  Highly recommended",1132531200,5,597,4.757281553398058
8095015,5,B000C11M3G,"Maule owner/pilot and photographer/producer Kevin Griffin couldn't have chosen a better guide and backcountry pilot than Herb Milhorn to take the viewer deep into the challenging backcountry of Idaho's canyons. The flying and filming is fantastic with just the right amount of narrative from Milhorn. Excellent also that there are numerous warnings that this is not a training video and that proper mountain flying instruction and skill needs to be acquired before attempting to visit these locations. As a Maule owner myself, the only thing better would have been to utilize a Maule for the flying, but a Skywagon is a good second choice. Very speedy delivery. Can't wait until Utah is ""exposed""!",1132272000,2,697,5.176991150442478
