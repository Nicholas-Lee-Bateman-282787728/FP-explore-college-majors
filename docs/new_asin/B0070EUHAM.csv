5046396,4,B0070EUHAM,"I liked this DVD. It goes all the way back to Wilt's high school days, and it features interviews with his high school coach (who in fact produced this documentary). It also features the audio from the game where he scored 100 points (I believe that game was not filmed). All in all it was well done and very nostalgic. I was left wanting more at the end, as it clocks in at a little under 1 hour. Highly recommended though for basketball fans who want to learn the history of this great athlete.",1335830400,9,496,4.287234042553192
5046397,5,B0070EUHAM,"Growing up with some of the NBA's modern greats like Jordan and Kobe, I never got a chance to really see Wilt play in his early career apart from clips shown on ESPN classics. This documentary proved to be an exceptional documentary about his early years in high school through his globetrotter days, up to his early record breaking days in his career. The Stilt was a beast compared to all those other high school kids.

WOW! It is outstanding to see how he changed so much of basketball. The film is a definite must see for any basketball fan old and new. You get to see the greatest basketball player ever and how he revolutionized the game. Check it out!",1335744000,10,658,4.43801652892562
5046398,5,B0070EUHAM,"I never knew about Wilt Chamberlain, up until I saw the news about a 50 year anniversary since Wilt's 100 point game. The films is interesting plus I've learned interesting facts:

The guy was 7 feet tall!! NBA changed the width of the 3 second zone from 12 to 16 feet because of his domination on the court!! It's ridiculous.

I'm giving it 5 stars.",1334620800,2,350,4.369230769230769

8507767,5,B0070EUHAM,"This documentary is a great gift for younger basketball players (at least ones who can figure out how to use a DVD disk!). I exposed some foreign college basketball players to Wilt. I still remember when Wilt not only got his paw up 2-3' above the rim, but also came down with the ball one-handed, one from Greece let out a big gasp.

At the end they said ""Why does not every basketball player in the world know his name?"".  I""m getting this for a graduation present for them. (Yes, I will rip it to remove region codes so they can watch it back home.)

Yes, Wilt was the greatest basketball player EVER. PERIOD.  Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to ponder this: he is the only NBA player to ever average 30 points and 20 rebounds over a season. That is, nobody else has done it EVEN ONCE.  Yet he did it 9 SEASONS!  Q.E.D.",1493251200,,824,4.283870967741936
8507768,2,B0070EUHAM,"An interesting look at the ""stilt"" but a lot of the discussion and focus here in on his youth. Good insight from his high school coach, and a little about his time with the globetrotters, but I would have like more stories from his time in the NBA",1484697600,,247,4.166666666666667
