8137741,5,B000H9KZB8,"This is a fun look at how pulling dinosaurs apart, with a sprinkling of 21st Century technology can help us understand more about the prehistoric past. The CGI is pretty good....much better than many seen in mainstream documentaries. There also seems to be an actual storyline, that is led by scientists and further validated by entertaining experiments....can science really be this fun? This is one for adults and children alike....given that the children will be explaining most of the science to the adults!",1278547200,,511,5.168674698795181
