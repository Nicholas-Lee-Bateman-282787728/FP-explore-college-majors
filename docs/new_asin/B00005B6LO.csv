7936847,1,B00005B6LO,"Project A-Ko was easily one of the more popular franchises to come out of Japan.  It was perfect.  Two students fight over the affection of a third student. (Think Archie) A large and well-developed cast of supporting characters.  A setting where almost anything could happen.  I have never understood why this wasn't made into a tv series.  Then along comes these two movies (theatricaly released, if I recall).  The relationship of the three characters is changed completely.  The background and supporting characters are gone, all gone.  And instead of the humor we were accustomed to, we get a plot and script that approaches the horror genre.  The fans stayed away in droves, and A-Ko was never seen again.  I can never forgive this movie for that, and it will never be a part of my collection.  And frankly, I don't reccomend it be a part of yours either.  This isn't Project A-ko. It's just a stolen title and stolen characters superimposed over an otherwise forgettable movie.",1017532800,9,984,4.86144578313253
7936848,4,B00005B6LO,"Many people are familiar with Project A-ko because it is classic anime from the 80's.  However not many people are aware that there are two different Project A-ko OAV series.  There are the original four movies with A-ko and B-ko fighting for the friendship of C-ko.  However there is the Versus movies.
This DVD contains both the Versus movies.  Project A-ko Versus 1: Gray Side.  and Project A-ko Versus 2: Blue side.  These series take the same characters and place them in different settings and situations.
The Versus Movies are a space story where the fate of the universe is at stake. The focus of the conflict is C-ko, who is kidnapped by space pirates who crash on a planet while losing C-ko in the process. A-ko and B-ko are firm friends and partners in this series and appear to be some sort of bounty hunters and when they find C-ko, well, you can imagine what happens here.  The pirates want to fuse some evil magician's soul into C-ko's body for some dark and tiwsted reason.
The music and the plot are not as great as the original movies but are interesting to say the very least.  I found the Project A-ko Versus not as comical as the other movies but very dramatic in some sort of odd love story.  Parents be warned,  like the rest of the other Project A-kos, there is mild nudity, sexual undertones, and transgenderal themes.",989366400,21,1343,4.558333333333334
