7045619,5,B00UITXJZQ,I'm so excited for the upcoming release of Bonanza season # 8. This is my very favorite show. Seasons 1 - 6 remain my favorites of all the seasons because of ( Parnell Roberts ) Adam Cartwright who is my favorite actor of all time. But I still love Bonanza even after he left. CBS keep them coming. They are a bit pricy but worth every penny. To own all 14 seasons would be a dream come true.,1430611200,4,392,4.038461538461538

Dan Blocker (1928-1972) is one of the true television immortals before his untimely death in 1972 at the age of 43.
Lorne Greene (1915-1987) was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, died at age 72 of pneumonia following heart surgery on September 11, 1987 in Santa Monica, California.
And even though he doen't appear this season, his spirit lives on
Pernell Roberts (1928-2010) elected not to renew his contract and left at the end of the 1964-1965 season to the utter dismay of his fans. a gap was always felt in the Cartwright family by this abrupt departure.

Special features include

My favorite episode is The Pursued Part1&2 the ugly specter of religious prejudice and intolerance is showcased here. Now a days you hear a lot of negative gobbledygook about single parents, this makes Bonanza even more relevant today than it was in the 1960s.

Finally, all 34 episodes from season 8 can be seen chronologically, beautifully remastered, and looking better than they did in 1966-67.",1434758400,,455,4.846153846153846

7045727,5,B00UITXJZQ,"Yay!! BONANZA Season 8 is finally here! What a treat! I have waited a long time for this one and I hope it won't be long before the rest are out. If you have younger kids, buy them this DVD set. Thats right! Im 23 years old. After really getting hooked on BONANZA when I was 16, believe me I know that there are younger folks out there that enjoy the show. BONANZA is a classic and its appeal is timeless! Do not pass up the opportunity to share this show with the younger generation.

The people behind the scenes have worked their butts off to give you the best set of classic episodes available on DVD. There are tons of extras. You have a fascinating old interview with a great, yet underappreciated director, William Witney. You get rare photos, and fun Chevrolet commercials not seen since the 1960s. You get to see the special short film that only visitors of the touring Ponderosa Caravan got to see. Nobodys seen it since the Caravan ceased touring in 1970! What a treat for this youngster who was born in 1991! (The Ponderosa Caravan was a replica of the ranch house, on wheels. It toured the U.S and Canada, appearing at fairs and rodeos.)

You can choose the option of not watching the commercials with an episode, but I wouldnt recommend that. (Its just one commercial, featuring a BONANZA cast member, and the commercial follows the end of the story.) What a treat! I feel like Im back in the 1960s watching it air each week on TV! At the start of every episode, you get to see the original NBC Peacock logo. Way cool! Thats a nice touch and I love seeing it every time I start an episode.

You also get audio commentaries on some episodes from guest stars, DVD executive producer Andrew J. Klyde, or historians. Its wonderful to watch and listen to the commentaries because you learn many facts about that episode, things that happened on the set, and other fun, random items. For example, I learned an NBC executive wrote The Pursued initially as a present for his actress wife. Wayne Newton, Mr. Las Vegas himself, took the time to reminisce about his episodes and some of his other work. Did you know that Wayne was offered his own series, but he took Lucille Balls advice and turned it down? Wait until you hear Ted Quinns memories of Michael Landon!

What really makes these DVD box sets a real treasure? They are digitally restored and re-mastered from original 35mm film. The quality is superb! The picture is so crisp and clear and you see so many details. It feels like Im there in the scene! It looks like it was filmed yesterday and not almost 50 years ago! As each season is released, the images do look better and better. That is likely because of the improved quality of color film stock the camera crew used over the years. Ive read that Eastman Kodak was so impressed with the quality of BONANZA that it sent producer David Dortort new, improved color film stock to use every year. He boasted in an interview, We have the best color in the business, and decades later, we can still see that!

Another reason to buy: episodes in Season 8 and from past releases of BONANZA are all UNCUT! You will be watching the complete episode with nothing removed. Also, Season 8 had the number 1 spot in Nielson ratings that season! Thats an honor!

These are truly the best collections of TV shows on DVD you can buy. I have many DVD box sets of old, classic TV shows and none of them can beat the hard work and care that goes into these Official BONANZA sets. It shows that CBSHE actually cares about the fans and want to put the best stuff out there.

Finally lets not leave out that there are some really excellent episodes this season! Yes, you might be able to watch reruns on TV, but they will not be uncut and/or digitally restored. (And they will be interrupted numerous times with commercials.) Or yes, it may be convenient to be able to stream, but you will appreciate being able to possess the DVDs instead. Youve got versatility. You could download the DVD to your computer, even pop the DVD into your computers disc drive (as well as hook up your DVD player to your big screen TV). So why pass up the chance to have Official Season 8 episodes UNCUT that you can watch anytime? Plus they come with TONS of extras you cant get anywhere else!

Want CBS Home Entertainment to release all 14 seasons? (Its 8 out so far, 6 more to go.) Your sale WILL make a difference. It has been rumored that this could be the last season on DVD because previous sales have not been as good as expected. So its really do or die time for everyone to purchase this season. Buy extra copies and give as gifts! Pass the word around  the Official BONANZA Season 8 is great! ORDER TODAY!

7045731,4,B00UITXJZQ,"Bonanza: Season Eight, Volumes 1 & 2 contains all 34 episodes of the shows 1966-1967 season on 9 discs. Lorne Green, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon star as Ben Cartwright and sons Hoss and Little Joe, respectively. Focus of the weekly series was the Ponderosa, the Cartwrights sprawling ranch in Nevada Territory in the 19th century.

The first network Western to be broadcast in color, Bonanza was one of the costliest shows on TV during its run. Pernell Roberts, who played eldest son Adam, left the show after six years. Bonanza racked up a total of 430 episodes over 14 seasons and was the second longest running Western series after Gunsmoke. The period covered is during and following the Civil War.

In Season 8, Bonanza tackled numerous contemporary issues. The season is a mixed bag of first-rate episodes and mediocre ones. The lack of consistency on a high level is probably due to the fact that so many stories had been presented and writers were repeating themselves on a number of episodes. Some seem all too familiar.

Much of the ongoing popularity of the program was its ability to blend Western action with personal stories of Ben, Hoss, Little Joe and the various individuals whose paths took them to the Ponderosa. The format was anthology with a core of regular characters. Guest stars in Season 8 include Ed Begley, Dina Merrill, Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan, Ann Doran, Wayne Newton, Lola Albright, Beau Bridges, Diane Baker, Leslie Nielsen, Jack Oakie, Louise Latham, Zsa Zsa Gabor, John Saxon, and Robert Middleton.

Bonus features include audio commentaries by Wayne Newton and Diane Baker; original NBC network logo, bumpers and Chevrolet promo; photo gallery; and the lost short film, Ponderosa Caravan (1967).",1432771200,7,1736,5.017361111111111
