Regardless of how you buy it, Speed Grapher definitely deserves to be better known. It's a wonderfully weird anime.",1405814400,,259,5.046511627906977
8135902,4,B000H1RG2W,"The two runaways make it to an abandoned research facility. They think that they be able to learn about the condition Kagura suffers from. Doing this may lead to a cure. While they are there, Saiga has a run-in with Suitengu and the true power of the enemy is revealed. Kagura is also taken back to Tokyo by a traitor.

This anime starts off with a bang. It's a constant thrill ride with some cool characters that have alarming special powers. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. This anime is very strange. The premise is very original and kinda takes you by surprise. If you've seen Eyes Wide Shut, you can kind of get a feel for the type of vibe this show has. It's not as perverted as Eyes Wide Shut, and this is mainly an action series,but the mood is very similar. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anime fans that don't mind a little weirdness sprinkled in with their anime.",1355011200,,925,4.409356725146199
