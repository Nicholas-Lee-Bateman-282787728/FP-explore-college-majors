8045017,5,B00076QKM4,"We have gotten our daughter every one of the Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss movies.  They are creative, short shows with good morals and fun music.  Each movie is a bit different, but they all have funny characters from the various Seuss books, and each character has its own personality.  I can't recommend them enough for children ages 4-9 (my daughter is 9 and she is not ready to part with them yet).",1267315200,3,402,4.47945205479452
