8210793,3,B000TSIJZQ,"For those, like myself, who needed to fill their Bela Lugosi film collection; this is a great bargain!  On many of the Lugosi discs offered you get two or three movies.  But this collection has FOUR.  ""The Phantom Creeps"" was originally a serial, but this output has the edited feature film version.  If you like serials, then this isn't for you.  But if you are like me, who have a hard time sitting through that format, then this IS for you.  Warning:  ""Scared to Death"" which is another on this disc, is featured in Black & White.  This was the ONLY movie that B.L. did in color.  So, again, if you want to see this movie in this manner, seek it else-where.  The other two movies on this disc- ""The Devil Bat"" and ""The Corpse Vanishes"" are also of pretty darn good viewing quality and better looking then some company releases of these very same films. One other thing, the music (if you want to call it that) used on the menu page is quite awful.",1223251200,3,950,4.346590909090909
