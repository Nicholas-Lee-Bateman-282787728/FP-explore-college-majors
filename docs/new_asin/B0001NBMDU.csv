8015045,1,B0001NBMDU,"I  usually like ""who done it"" types of movies, but this one was awful. Although there were moments of interest, I turned it off when it was half way through the movie and threw it out. (I did not even want to resell it).  Unless you are easily entertained, don't waste your money or time on this one.",1364774400,2,300,4.155172413793103
8015046,3,B0001NBMDU,"The film was not what I expected, it could have been better. I slept through part of it without missing a beat.",1173312000,4,111,4.090909090909091
