525283,1,6302980399,"I would not recommend this film: Spanish only (no subtitles), not good special effects, a sub plot that is really corny. I purchased thinking it was the film Guadalupe that was recently made in Mexico that is supposed to be really good- it's not.",1198800000,5,246,4.613636363636363
525284,4,6302980399,"This has a cartoon feeling to it at times, with some hokey dialogue, costumes and sets, and some ""babe"" looking women. The set peluquero must have been very busy with the hairspray. Anglica Chain, who plays Doa Blanca, the virrey's daughter, looks every inch like Barbie. Fernando Allende plays the simple Juan Diego, and does a good job of it, even under the heavy dose of...yes, you guessed it...hairspray !
The opening titles are followed by: ""Los incidentes que rodearon la aparicin de nuestra Seora de Guadalupe han sido reproducidos con estricto apego a la verdad histrica. Los dilogos entre la Virgen y Juan Diego fueron traducidos originalmente del Nahuatl por el Bachiller Luis Lasso de La Vega de acuerdo con la versin que le hizo el Indio Valeriano"".
Pehaps due to my reverential love of the Virgen de Guadalupe, there were times I was very moved, to the point of getting goosebumps...and despite the acting which at times could be labeled as inept (much better can be seen in the average daytime telenovela), I found this to be a most enjoyable 90 minutes, and well spent.",980726400,5,1084,4.802139037433155
525285,4,6302980399,"Who but Juan Diego would have the nerve to ask the Blessed Virgin: Little  girl, did you have a good sleep last night? - I've had this movie for some  time and I like it very much.  I am sure there are a lot of people like me  who don't know the Spanish language very well and who would like to have a  version of it dubbed in English, or at least with English subtitles.",965865600,,371,3.8933333333333335
