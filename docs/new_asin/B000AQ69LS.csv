2390391,4,B000AQ69LS,"I saw this film at a film festival in Palm Springs. Believe me when I say, it is awesome! Not only does it have the wonderful Adam Beach but a great story. I personally get sick when films take about 'sole-mates' and that kind of thing. I was so please to find that this film was not sappy or contrived. Out of an audience of 300 people, everyone was crying at the end. I'm talking EVERYONE. Grown men, sobbing! I never saw it come out to the major theaters and was so sad. If you get the chance, watch this great film! Highly recommended",1128816000,10,538,4.1826923076923075

Mia Kirshner is really good.  Gordon Tootoois is wonderful as John's father.  I loved the lines in the movie that he spoke:
""Your Body is What You Are""
""Your Soul is who you are""
""Your soul is your purpose""

I was looking thru the Rentals again when I came across this movie and thought I would check to see if Amazon had it.  So, instead of renting it again, I thought I would purchase it then I could watch it whenever I wanted.  I ordered it online thru Amazon, and they did not have the movie in stock, but listed a few of their sellers who did.  I picked the Seller who was called (unfortunately, I discarded the invoice that came with the DVD) I don't remember the full name of the Seller,  but it was Selection (with some numbers after it).

2390414,5,B000AQ69LS,"I got this movie because I married a Native American and have been on the Red Road about a year now. I am also an Adam Beach fan. But I had no idea how much the film, and the story of love and hope that transcends time and space would captivate me. I only watched it last night and was so gripped by it's message and medicine that I tossed and turned all night thinking about the movie and all the many faceted meanings of the storyline. It got me big time, and as a person who had a traumatic childhood a bit like the Mia Kirschner role, I really identified with what she went through in her early years.

Adam Beach's performance is stellar and breathtaking. He is gifted. Part of that I think is his Good Medicine, which you can see, feel and even touch in so many ways. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Gordon Tootoosis as well.",1264032000,,829,4.213836477987422
2390415,5,B000AQ69LS,"Now THIS is what I call one of the most powerful and most compellingly moving coming-of-age love stories I have ever, ever seen in Native American cinema, despite the film's initial low-budget look.  I personally found the performances by both Adam Beach (playing John Myron) and Mia Kirshner (playing Angela Wilson) to be so rather captivating, so powerfully gripping, and so, so true on a much more human level... especially when it came to the slowly blossoming and increasingly intimate romance between the two of them, despite their completely different racial backgrounds.  I was definitely blown away indeed, and what wonderful chemistry they produce in one another, too!!!

And I DEFINITELY LOVED the way that this movie immediately overcame and just totally abolished the all-too-popular racial ethnic stereotypes between the whites and Native Americans that we have seen probably way too much of from Hollywood since our youths, and that is so brilliantly refreshing for a film like this!!!

Another thing I so especially and genuinely admired about ""Now and Forever"" is that it seriously and quite unapologetically embraces and honors Native American traditions as well as its amazing spirituality as it cuts REAL deep into the core center of its great spiritual power indeed, all without any filters or compromises whatsoever.  And I thought Gordon Tootoosis -- playing such an excellent wise-man known as Ghost Fox (who is also John Myron's father as well) -- did really a fantastic, fantastic job in enabling us deeply to cherish these most sacred traditions indeed, both in dialogue and in his amazingly convincing acting as well... especially in the middle of the central romance between John and Angela also!!

BUT, what really took me by *complete* surprise and elevated this whole film all the way into a rather special piece of Native American filmmaking for me personally in addition was the most compelling way that it deals with and especially overcomes the sexual trauma of Angela that took place since she was suddenly being brutally raped and betrayed in a motel by that creepy lying slimebag of a man that she dated known as T.J. Bolt (played by Gabriel Olds), and replaces such horrific scars with such truest and much more poignant love and chemistry between John and Angela as their relationship slowly yet surely not only penetrates and overcomes that rotten sex abuse that that other man did, but also their quite interesting rapport with one another eventually transcends and blossoms beyond even the great boundaries of time itself, into something ever more intimate and passionate that can *actually* heal those nasty, nasty scars indeed.  Because of this, I suddenly had a much more intense rooting interest in both John and Angela as the two main leads here, as he seriously enables her and helps her both overcome that near-fatal trauma as well as place the pieces of her life back together emotionally and spiritually.  With all of his heart, no less.  ;)

And the way this all plays out from the beginning to the very end... it is just OUTSTANDING FIRST-RATE material right here with a truly magnificent blend of pure Native American sacredness that is definitely not to be missed, and that completely humanizes this whole romance story, I most believe, because this all completely made sense and captivated me quite splendidly rather instead of it being turned into overwrought hyped-up melodrama that tends to not solve any problems at all... and I totally appreciated this entire film and its big payoff as a result!!!

Congratulations to director Bob Clark for creating this spectacular low-budget gem and finally getting the Native American traditions RIGHT!!!  That said, I am personally giving such a rather strong recommendation to ""Now and Forever"", a most definite add as one of the very best Native American films that you can buy on DVD, right along with the 1998 smash hit ""Smoke Signals"" on which Adam Beach also starred himself... brilliant, brilliant, BRILLIANT!!!!",1254873600,2,4021,5.094224924012158

2390418,5,B000AQ69LS,"I received this DVD within a week. I wanted to have it in time for a visit from my Daughter, and sixteen year old Granddaughter. I had seen the movie on Lifetime movie network, and I thought it was an important lesson for a young girl or anyone to learn, on what true love is all about. We cried through the sad parts, which were many, and hoped that life and true love really were everlasting. It is a wonderful movie. It gives us faith that truely good people do exist, we just have to open our eyes and hearts to find them.  K.L. Bennard",1243641600,,540,4.142857142857143
2390419,5,B000AQ69LS,"This movie is a tear jerker. Well put together, I Saw It Last Weekend even though it came out a few years back. I don't know if it did win any awards but it truly deserves an Oscar. Beautiful plot and story.",1237420800,,207,3.9523809523809526
2390420,3,B000AQ69LS,"I bought this movie when Hollywood Videos was going out of business. Never heard of most of the actors. Popped in the DVD one night when I could not sleep. Even though for most adults the plot and ending will seem obvious, it is captivating like going down a lazy river that you know well but still enjoy. I think it would be a good movie for teens despite the R rating, it has all positive messages. I am jaded so it didn't strike me in the heart like it would my teen girls. It nice to see something that doesn't have the usual storylines and carries a sweet message of hope. It was interesting seeing the Native American Indian viewpoints played out. I did not like the not so obvious western religious undertones and heavy handed messages. Still was quite beautifully filmed. One of the good lessons is Now is Forever, your actions will have consequences for the rest of your life,(and maybe even after) so think about what you do. I really loved the soundtrack and will buy it when I find it.",1225152000,,997,4.394594594594595

Mia Kirshner is a treasure and Adam Beach is throwback to the days when romantic leads were REAL men..full of strength, dignity and gentleness..
Be sure to see and enrich your soul",1215993600,,381,4.701492537313433
2390422,5,B000AQ69LS,"I purchased this movie because I was a fan of Adam Beach and was not disappointed.  I thought the movie was a little slow in the beginning but as you proceed through the movie, it will be come very clear.  It is a movie that you will want to watch again once you have seen it.  If you find yourself asking questions in the movie, have heart, you will get the answers in the end.

This was a movie I could not put out of my mind.  I plan to watch it again, soon.......knowing what I now know, I think I will enjoy this bittersweet movie even more!",1213056000,,546,4.018518518518518
2390423,5,B000AQ69LS,"I find it difficult at times to articulate the appropriate words to describe a movie that reaches out to me in ways I do not comprehend; that stir feelings, memories, thoughts, and conceptualizations into a mixed bag of emotions.  To my chagrin, ""Now and Forever"" is one of those movies.  Yet, it is the movie I turn to most often when I am feeling down and out,  all alone, or self-pitting.  And every time I watch this magnificent film, I ask myself, why is this movie not more popular; why am I just the 19th person to write a review; what can I contribute that will motivate others to view this theatrical wonder?  That is, how can I accomplish what John Myron (Adam Beach) in the movie tries to get Angela to do: ""to see what I see through my eyes.""  It would seem that I am less capable of such a feat than John; yet my passion for this film is like John's for Angela Wilson (Mia Kirshner), and so I must try.

Like many films involving Native American themes, ""Now and Forever"" is told like a tale or campfire story, in mimicry of the oral tradition.  Hence,  John is narrating the story, and the story walks the sacred circular path in its telling; and Trickster is involved as well.  Now if you are familiar with the usual traditional Native American story telling format--and let me make it clear I am not suggesting all Native Nations nor all their stories use the same format--the viewer should have no problem ""hearing"" the story under the obvious.  However, if you are not familiar with the oral story telling format, you most likely will ""see"" the movie rather than ""hear"" the story.  Unfortunately, learning to ""hear,"" and not just ""see,"" is a process difficult to explain and harder to accomplish.  And while there may have been a time when I could have explained the process, my mind is not what it used to be, and I will have to resort to hints that may help facilitate the process for the viewer.

My first tip is that many Native American stories are told to educate or inform the listener; which means the story may contain information that seems pointless or out of context.  That is, for many the story will ""drag"" in parts because the content seems to have no linearly logical connection to the story--because the story is telling us details to enlighten us about something important.  This raises my second tip: as stated previously, Native American stories are circular, not linear in their telling.  For those steeped in linear thinking, consider how flashbacks in a movie return you to a different point in the story.  Circular thinking is similar, but more complex.  Another analogy may be taken from birds of prey: they circle, dive, circle, dive, etc., until they are ready to snatch the prey; so, circular logic circles and moves towards the theme/plot numerous times, until the story is filled in, and then it exposes the theme/plot.  And so it is with ""Now and Forever;"" except that the movie is layered so one can ""see"" the surface story and/or ""hear"" the underlying story.  The most simplistic layerings, then, include the narration--circling--and non-narration--dives or steps towards the objective; and flashbacks.  My third hint, again as suggested earlier, is that Trickster is a major ""character"" in the underlying story of ""Now and Forever""--although he is spoken about in the movie.  Trickster is easier for many to spot because he is an antiquated character found in the older stories of European origin as well; so those familiar with such stories may recall hearing of them (Loki is one name used, for example).  Trickster's role in any given story can range from helpful to comical to hindering, but almost always not what you expect; hence, the name Trickster.  Fourth, most Native American stories delineate between the sacred and the profane, not good and evil.  The sacred involves ""power"" and ""spirituality, "" while the profane concerns commonality, everyday, mundane, and material aspects of life.  And to complicate matters, a being or object can possess both sacred and profane characteristics--the profane being obvious, the sacred being hidden.  In ""Now and Forever"" the stone is the most obvious of thing that represents both, while the characters--as, indeed, all people--are the second easiest to recognize.

""Now and Forever"" contains within it all four aspects discussed above, and that is why it is hard for me to fully put into words the story that touches me so deeply.  And in many ways, like a truly great story, ""Now and Forever"" must be watched repeatedly to hear more and more of what the story is telling us, because not only must one hear the story, they must feel the story.  It is in truly feeling the story that one can come to fully appreciate, respect, and understand the power of  this wonderful film.

That is not to say a viewer cannot ""see"" the beauty and charm of the film--or even hear the depth and meaning of the movie--in just one viewing, but rather to suggest that like many things in life, repetition strengthens one's ability; in this case one's ability to hear, feel, and more fully understand and appreciate the story and the movie.  And in doing so, ""Now and Forever"" will no longer seem like just another story of romance, another ""Love Story,"" or another Hallmark story.  ""Now and Forever"" is a low budget movie that produces more than one could expect, because the script, story, portrayals, editing, and production all interact in a simple, yet powerful, way to create a picture that is way more than the sum of its' parts.  I can only image how much greater the film would be if it had the ""budget"" to make it comparable to major releases.

Then again, I wonder if people/viewers would be willing enough to slow down and take the time to absorb the film, and, more importantly, be willing to view a movie in a more attentive way than most want to view a movie.  And of course, there is the stereotyping issue: ""Now and Forever"" is most likely preconceived as an ""Indian movie,"" rather than a ""humanistic"" movie with universal meaningfulness.  Sadly, I believe, that in the final analysis, the difference of opinions about ""Now and Forever"" have been reduced to this stereotyping--especially on Amazon.com where it pops up as a similar movie to other movies identified as ""Indian,"" American Indian,"" or ""Native American,"" but never for ""romance,"" ""drama,"" ""spirituality,"" or other ""non-Native American like"" tags.

So, in the end, all I can say is, please give ""Now and Forever"" a chance to win you over; to lift you above its' apparent simplicity and stereotyped genre, and truly enjoy a movie of great value.

It just shows how God intervenes in our life by bringing people in our path that will carry us through the bad times and love us unconditionally the way God does.

2390432,1,B000AQ69LS,"The story line is good (although extremely slow at times), but definitely has a new age message to promote.  From Angela's soliloguy in her school play that she is in everything and everything is in her to her conversation with John's father who tells her John learned about the Catholic religion because ""Jesus was a good teacher and I felt like he could learn something from Him"".  He also goes on to say that although John learned about Catholicism, he practiced his own religion.  I've watched and enjoyed other movies that are about similar subjects (Somewhere in Time; Two Lives of Jennie Logan; Hallmark's The Love Letter), but this was a blatant affront to Christianity by bringing Jesus into it at all.  Jesus was not just a good teacher and the line was completely unnecessary in the movie unless they were trying to promote their new age religion.

The R rating is also well deserved - there are two episodes of explicit teenage sex and crude discussions about it later on.  So, buyers, beware - there's an agenda in this movie.",1173052800,2,1039,4.712707182320442

SPOILER

When you go from Mia's character leaving town to becoming a star, the transition is so fast that it just is not believable.

And quite frankly, the movie is dull and is a waste of Adam Beach.

Mia, while I do think she can act to an extent, seems to be typecaste now. (If you've seen her on the L word- another self destructive character)

Overall, a decent sob movie but a waste of good actors and could have been done better.",1173052800,3,554,4.288461538461538

Unfortunately the movie had to play the evil white male card and only spiritual native Americans could make the plot work. I suppose the lead male could have been a Christain celibate white male (or Forrest Gump?) but I suppose the resurrection angle wouldn't have flown too well. Is it so rare to find men who treat women respectfully or worse fake kindness to get something in return? Is it only possible in the mystical world of make believe?

Anyway if you like Mia I recommend Cowboys and Angels, and especially Exotica, and probably a few others I haven't seen yet. A first rate actress.",1152144000,3,712,4.606299212598425

After viewing it my girlfriend felt the same and we are now trying to work things out. What greater a review can I offer than that. It has given us a second chance as strange as that may sound. Watch it and it may change your life as well.,1150848000,16,523,3.8073394495412844

2390438,5,B000AQ69LS,"A lifelong friendship between a young Indian boy and a white girl survives the test of time and the bigotry of their small, rural community to finally blossom into true love only when one of them is battling a terminal illness. However there is much more going on than what can be seen, heard, or felt. There are spiritual forces afoot, the Indian spirit known as the Trickster is up to his old tricks and one doesn't discover until the very end how Angela and John's love will survive in this life and in the life to come.

'Now and Forever' is a a tragic yet heartwarming love story in the tradition of 'Somewhere In Time.' Mia Kirshner and Adam Beach are magnificent as the ill-fated lovers, as is Gordon Tootoosis as Ghost Fox.

2390439,5,B000AQ69LS,"""Now and Forever"" is a small film with incredible beauty and depth, and if it has flaws, they are well overridden by its strengths. The plot concerns two young people whose destinies are interwoven: John, who is part of the Cree Nation (and whose tribal name means ""he who stands both here and there""), and Angela, the girl he loves from the moment he sees her, when they meet as teenagers. Angela's one desire is to escape from her mother and the small town they live in, and this leads her down destructive paths, and John's desire and purpose in life is to protect her.

The cast is excellent: Adam Beach is fantastic as John; he is strong and handsome, and has a charisma that fills the screen, and as Angela, Mia Kirchner has a mix of ""fighting spirit"" and vulnerability that is perfect for the part. Theresa Russell gives yet another marvelous performance as Angela's mother, the town slut, who warns her daughter by saying ""it gets easier and easier to do it for less."" One of the best features of this film is the presence of Gordon Tootoosis as John's father, Ghost Fox. He is the vision elder of the tribe, and is full of wisdom and knowledge, and Tootoosis is superb in the part. Filling out the central cast is the ""dark spirit"" of the plot, T. J. Bolt, played with a nice slice of slime by Gabriel Olds.

Directed with good pacing by Bob Clark, well written by Bill Boyle, and with a lovely score by Paul Zaza, this low-budget film exceeds expectations. Filmed in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, ""Now and Forever"" is much more than a fantasy romance, it has a heart of truth that few films achieve, and stands up to many viewings. Total running time is 105 minutes.",1132876800,40,1671,4.511551155115511

Mia Kirshner along with the entire cast does an excellent job of bringing this story to life and feeling the pain of their characters.
