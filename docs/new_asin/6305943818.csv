1924250,4,6305943818,"It never fails that every time I experience this film, and I've seen it now about three times in the past year, it produces a vastly different reaction each time I view it.  I bounce from absolute admiration for Franco's directorial style, dreamy camerawork and musical score, and committed performances from the cast, to thinking that this is nothing but a cheap, porno-wanna-be-flick with absolutely nothing to do with ""vampires"", and no artistic integrity whatsoever.  Fortunately, the positive vibes win out over the negative and I, once again, admire this film and all that is right and wrong with it.  If I fail to make sense, well good then, because neither does this flick.  Ms. Romay is, to say the least, totally uninhibited as she romps about the beautifully filmed outdoor scenes while a Chopin-like score lusciously underscores her every movement.  Her scenes with the bed posts are, er...., quite a moment in the Euro-Erotic field, and the way she swishes and moves about on her bed like a pent-up, totally horny young woman about to have an orgasm for the first time is, well...... something to see.  I love the moments of male frontal nudity, especially a scene where Ms. Romay is seducing a hotel masseur. The simulated sex is quite laughable, especially since our young man can't seem to ""get it up"".  This is quite an atmospheric film and, if you love your 70's horror/vampire flicks, I think you will find much to admire in this one.

1924251,3,6305943818,"That Jess Franco sure was wacky.  This ultra-sexy 70's vamp flick probably arouses me more than any modern softcore film, but it's still not as good as Vampire Femmes or Vampyres.  The woman here isn't really a vampire in the monster sense of the word.  She's more of an energy sucker, kills by sucking sexual energy from her victims.  The bad acting will get on some's nerves, and the plot is ludicrous, but if you buy this film to begin with, you can't expect Citizen Kane.  A good b-movie sexfest.",1085270400,24,500,4.511111111111111
1924252,4,6305943818,"Female Vampire was the first film Jess Franco made after the death of his star and lover, Soledad Miranda, and the film is a haunting and mournful examination of fate and loss.  On the surface there does not seem much to warrnt the very high opinion I have of this film: the dialogue is ludicrous, often pretentious, and the acting merely passable, at best.  Viewed as horror or porno the film would seem to have none of the qualities we desire from either of those genres: deliberate pacing, various props to create atmosphere, an internal logic, no matter how warped.  So while it may seem immediately facile to say so I think this film has more in common with 60's and 70's avant-garde that with, say, Hammer, or Corman.  Stan Brakhage came to my mind after watching Female Vampire.  Both Brakhage and Franco are obsessed with film as a purely visual medium, but whereas Brakhage sought to reproduce the way the mechanism of the eye perceives information, without interpreting the stimuli, Franco is more concerned with the memory's hold on what the eye takes in. Franco's camerawork can only be described as insatiable--it is the most tactile and grasping use of the lens imaginable.  The line on Franco is, and you hear it repeated over and over, that he 'overuses the zoom lens' but he does so, I feel, to imbue the film's space with consciousness, to feel every inch of the subject in the lens (usually the luscious Lina Romay).  But like all vampires, Jess Franco's starving eye can never hold, keep, or own, that which it craves so desperately, namely lost Soledad, the pulsing blood of time itself. . . .",997920000,30,1614,4.681978798586573

Yes, it's cut, nearly all the horror of the original version ""Erotikill / Black Countess"" has been removed. The female vampire in this movie doesn't kill with her fangs... Jess Franco directed some nice movies in the past : I can recommend ""Awfull dr. Orloff"" and ""Bloody Judge"",  but he has made a lot of worthless trash too. Avoid if you are a horror fan. The additional footage (ten minutes) of the horror only version is definitely not enough...  They should have made a DVD with the complete horror version!",979430400,10,676,4.578512396694215
1924254,4,6305943818,"Lina Romay, just dressed in high boots and a cape, slowly walks around in the foggy woods. The wonderful titlemusic by Daniel White is playing. Director Jess Franco is zooming in on her genitals, then he zooms out again. She is now walking towards the camera... and hitting her face in the cameralense. This is the so-called poetic intro of this weird film. Romay plays the vampire who must suck... ,well it's not blood exactly, to survive. The real hard-core scenes are censored from most versions of this film. So here we have a porn, with most of the explicit scenes cut, and left is the weird story, if we could call it a story. This is just a strange mess set on a hotel. A female reporter is going to interview Romay, who can't talk so she just have to nod or shake her head to answer. It ends up in lesbian sex ofcourse. Some cops are researching the murders and one, played by Jess Franco himself, believes it can be a vampire involved. Jack Taylor plays the male lead (yes, the guy from Polanskis The Ninth Gate). He is dubbed by a guy talking so bad english that it gives the impression that Jack is retarded. This is weird fun if you are into strange euro films, guess you know yourself if you wan't to see this film.

Lena Romay, Franco's favourite  female star, turns in a fine performance as the mute female vampire, while  Franco's ever-wobbly camera seems obsessed with her, lingering over her  body in close-up.  Expect ample sex, violence, combined with high art, for  a unique and satisfying european flick.

1924256,4,6305943818,"The new IMAGE DVD of Jess Franco's ""Female Vampire"" is a welcome  addition to any Francophile or euro-horror fan's collection.  The movie  reeks with an ethereal mood and pace and the euro-lounge theme music  (played through about 90% of the flick!)  is catchy and will haunt you long  afterwards.  Irina the lonely vampire goes from one victim to the next  ---  that's about it for story --- but who cares!  This is Franco at his best!  Be forewarned --- this is definitely a Very Mature movie so keep the young  ones away!  Released in a few different versions over the years, this 101  minute version is closest to ""The Loves of Irina"" version once  released on VHS by Private Screenings.  Alternate scenes from the  ""Erotikill"" version are included as a supplement (app. 8 minutes)  and basically include all the attack scenes which show Irina drinking  blood.  For some reason, the alternate scenes are not in chronological  order.  The movie is letterboxed at 2.35:1 and looks fine, but some shots  seem to be over matted (but maybe that's just the way it is).  Image  quality is a bit soft and there are two moments of print damage (streaking  of image for app. 30 seconds -sprocket hole damage?), but basically it's a  very nice presentation and a MUST BUY!!!

1924265,2,6305943818,"First of all before I begin I would like to say I am reviewing the amazon video version so if amazon censored scenes then maybe its a better film on an uncut DVD.

Well if you grade it as a vampire film it sort of fails miserably and is rather disappointing I might add.  As an erotic film some of the scenes are very sexy, but lack the artistic edge or a real interesting story so it feels more like a porno flick.

Also If you are into sexy female vampires you won't find them here ( How Ironic) because as sexy as this lead actress is, vampire she is not.  Where is the blood? The DVD cover art is misleading because that scene depicted has no blood in it.  Now granted I didn't finish the film but I did skip to the end  and as far as I know there is no blood in the first hour of the film. Also it doesn't really end it just sort of stops. So it left me unsatisfied.

I wanted to see an erotic horror. A mix of both pleasure and fear and all I got really was about 10 minutes of pleasure then boredom. It's just a soft core porno that pretends to be an erotic film.

Who would like this? Well Jess Franco collectors I suppose, and maybe guys who feel guilty watching porn and think erotic films are ok because they are ""Not"" porn.

I don't really think there is a big difference other than the fact that when an erotic film is good its not described as porn its described as ""Art"". Art this film is not but there are some hot scenes in it so at least there is that.

The best erotic films are the ones that are so interesting and good that  you wish you tell friends about them but can't because you'll look like a pervert. Female Vampire doesn't have this quality it doesn't even belong with the great hardcore erotic films like ""Caf Flesh"" or ""Night Dreams"" because it just doesn't even leave a lasting impression.",1473984000,3,1821,4.1303116147308785

1924286,3,6305943818,"""Female Vampire""(1973) is directed by Jess Franco. This film is about a vampire (Lina Romay) who lives in a coastal Mediterranean town and lives the melancholy life of someone who doesn't want to, but has to, feed on humans in order to survive. The film is beautifully photographed with misty, foggy landscapes. Interior scenes often have a chiaroscuro look of a Rembrandt painting. The female vampire is mute, and there is generally very little dialogue in the film, though there is sometimes a voice over narrative of the female vampire as she discusses her feelings about her lonely life as a vampire. The mute nature of the character seems to enhance this vampire as an erotic object of the voyeurs gaze. This is a very slow, almost hypnotic film, that is erotic and sensual in its approach, rather than horrific, and dramatic. The acting of Lina Romay is very limited, but this doesn't detract from the film's allure. This is one of Franco's more interesting films, along with other films such as the ""The Awful Dr. Orlof""(1962), or ""Eugenie, the Story of Her Journey into Perversion""(1968).

This film has not been restored and so many instances of dust appear. ""Female Vampire"" is the extended erotic version (100 min) of the film which Franco directed. There were also two other shorter versions of the movie with less erotic content and a little more gore. Included with this set is the shorter horror version (70 min) retitled ""Erotikill"", and two separate features with interviews with the director, and the co-star (Jean-Pierre Bouyxou).",1454112000,,1549,4.957692307692308
1924287,4,6305943818,"This is a pretty entertaining and fast moving production.  It explores the allegory of vampirism in the more literal ""Taoist"" sense of preying on the vital essences  of victims not their blood.  The protagonist is a young female vampire who spends a lot of time running about in a cape,belt and boots and nothing else.  If I ever run across a woman dressed in such clothes who tries to seduce me I will certainly be wary, if that is possible.....

Others have commented on the dialogue, scenes, and the overall plot.  I don't disagree, but, I am also mindful of the times in which this effort was produced.  Lina and her husband made the most of what they had.  Maybe they weren't thespians in the tradition of Shakespeare, but, they managed to make a little cinematic history...else we (all) wouldn't be here sharing our opinions!

While I enjoy female nudity as much as anyone, I must admit to being overdosed on it within a few minutes. Countess Karlstein (Lina Romay) is certainly beautiful, as are others in this film (especially the female journalist). I enjoy the basic story of vampirism and lust, and Ms. Romay's silent portrayal adds a bit of mystique to her ominous, cold character. The scene where the Countess turns the tables on a pair of murderous, sexual sadists is priceless! The finale is also quite effective. So, the horror version gets an enthusiastic five stars.

If they did any 'remastering' or clean-up of the movie they did a real bad job or at least should have done better. I'm considering this was shot in the early seventies. I have a lot of music video from that era that have really been cleaned-up and remastered. Contrast is terrible. Shadows and dark pubic hair are just blurry black spots. There's a lot of drops. I suppose it could be worse, but I expect more for an HD version. Although right now anyway the bluray is cheaper than the regular dvd!
As far as the movie I enjoyed it as I have other Jess Franco movies. There's graphic nudity and softcore sex that equals todays cable softcore. It just isn't as clear.
The ""Erotikill"" version doesn't make sense. The whole idea of this movie is sex. Lina sucks the cum out of men and women until they die. Erotikill takes out all those scenes.
This can be watched in it's original French with or without English subtitles or in dubbed English.
There is an interview with Franco after Lina's death in 2012. There is also an interview with Lina's co-star in this movie, Jean Pierre Bouyxou, done after Lina's death. (I'm not sure if it was before Franco's death earlier this year, but he does mention thinking Franco was the one he was concerned about the last time he saw the two.)
Then there are trailers for other Franco movies: Female Vampire, Exorcism/Demoniac, The Rape of the Vampire, The Nude Vampire, and Requiem for a Vampire.
One other note, the women in this movie, including Lina, would never be in contention for any beauty pageant award. That said there's something Franco brings out in them that make them sexy, especially his wife, Lina!

1924310,5,6305943818,"The film industry suffered a major loss this past month with the passing of the greatest erotic Horror film maker ever, Jesus Franco and last year , his muse Lina Romay who created some of the most incredible images ever to grace the screen.  Redemption has been releasing the Franco Image Entertainment releases of over a decade ago in new Blu-Ray incarnations so that first time viewers and Franco fans can appreciate his style and mojo better than ever.  After the death of his major leading lady Soledad Miranda, Franco discovered 19 year old Lina Romay who worked behind the scenes for many of his productions and with this film 'FEMALE VAMPIRE'aka 'LA COMTESSE AUX SEINS NUS' aka 'LES AVALEUSES'- 1973, their erotic fusion was set.  Included at the party are Franco stalwarts Alice Arno who would also be immortalized in 'THE PERVERSE COUNTESS' made the same year; Jack Taylor as the doomed Baron Von Rathony; the eccentric Monica Swinn and of course, a cameo from Jess himself. The film is one of his most popular titles and which was the first to reach the home video market back in the Eighties under various versions released by Private Screenings and Wizard Video among others.  That's because there are at least three different versions out there: a Horror version known as 'THE BARE-BREASTED COUNTESS' or 'EROTIKILL'; a soft core version known as 'THE LOVES OF IRINA'; and a hardcore version known as 'LES AVALEUSES' aka 'THE SWALLOWERS'. When Image Entertainment first released it on DVD under the title 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' , it was the soft core version that viewers saw trimmed of some hardcore fellatio scenes which seemed to be inserted and which fails to match the footage already present.  Redemption has released both the Horror and soft versions without the X-rated footage on Blu-Ray in beautiful 1080P cleaning up some of the murky elements of the Image disc and has 2.0 mono sound  with French and English tracks with optional English sub titles.  The beauty of actress Lina Romay and the films locations ( Belgium, France, and the Portugese island of Madiera) can now be fully appreciated along with composer Daniel White's dreamy ethereal score.  Although vampire eroticism was introduced by Franco three years previous with 'VAMPYROS LESBOS' -1970 starring Soledad Miranda along with French Director Jean Rollin's erotic vampire films of which his masterpiece 'LIPS OF BLOOD' aka 'LEVRES DE SANG'-1975 owes a major debt, it helped pave the way for Director Harry Kumel's classic 'DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS' -1971  and would go on to influence Director Joseph Larraz's 'VAMPYRES'-1975 among others. The Blu-Ray has some great special features: a 13 minute interview with Franco 'DESTINY IN SOFT FOCUS' with essential anecdotes on the shooting of the film; A 10 minute interview with actor Jean-Pierre Bouyxou who plays Dr. Orloff in the film and worked with Director Jean Rollin narrating a featurette on Lina Romay 'WORDS FOR LINA';  and trailers for other Redemption releases.  This package comes highly recommended and Jess, even if Hollywood didn't give you a tribute or passing words, your films will live on long after the tripe passing off as modern Horror is being forced on to the film going public as we recollect your output.",1365811200,12,3256,5.011111111111111

I had no clue this was an erotikill until about 5 mins in she got nude with a guy and killed him by basically having sex with him? This threw me off but continued to watch. I would not rate this as 3 stars if this were supposed to be a movie. The people are actually talking in another language and the english voices are voiced over the people so their lips are moving when they aren't talking which is a little weird for me as well. Something that actually kinda irritated me throughout the film is that the same song is played throughout the whole film; and it's played a lot too (probably a good 45 mins of the film).",1360281600,,695,4.117647058823529
1924316,2,6305943818,"Jess Franco is a filmmaker of great notoriety.  His films are all exploitative and include subjects such as women in prison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Women/dp/B000795JN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99 Women</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sadomania/dp/B000096IA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sadomania</a>) and lesbian vampires (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampyros-Lesbos/dp/6305334730/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampyros Lesbos</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-Killed-in-Ecstasy/dp/6305789657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She Killed in Ecstasy</a>, and this movie).  His films are, at least in my opinion, garbage.  This particular film has many different titles but is primarily known as Female Vampire, at least in as far as what I've heard about it.  It also goes by The Bare-Breasted Countess, The Dark Countess, Erotikill, and The Swallowers, among others.  Many versions of the film exist and the differences primarily revolve around the extent of the adult content, with violence ranging from tame to brutal (and really stupid looking) and nudity ranging from moderate to hardcore.  The version I've seen is the one I'm reviewing called Female Vampire and it lacks the violence but includes extensive nudity that falls just short of hardcore.

It really is just a camera fixated on Lina Romay's naked body.  Lina eventually became Franco's wife so in some ways it might be interesting in that respect.  Obviously, he's attracted to her and who wouldn't be attracted to a mute fair-skinned naked vampire chick with jet-black hair bathing in blood, right?  She was a good looking woman actually, but from what I understand she still does work like this and she's got to be in her late 50s or even her 60s, so not to sound judgmental but I can't imagine time has been that good to her.

The film follows Irina Van Karstein (Romay), a mostly naked vampire who needs to feed on her various sexual partners' genitals for sustenance.  There's the plot.  Sorry my summary paragraph was so darn short.

Female Vampire is not a porn, nor is it really a horror movie.  Nothing about it feels in any way cohesive at all.  It's a purposeless waste of time, an exercise in Jess Franco's twisted view on the world of filmmaking. I do not understand his films, not because they are too smart for me but because they in no way wish to be understood as more than just trash.  In more ways than not, that is not alright with me.  However, I find Franco's existence to be fascinating at the very least, much like I do Ed Wood, Jean Rollin (who did make some films I love), and more recently Uwe Boll.  Why do some people make movies?  What fuels them?  Could it really at times just be their most primal drives?  The answers do not really matter, nor do the very things that would compel me to ask the questions.",1359417600,2,2987,5.68018018018018

1924318,4,6305943818,"I do not know what everyone is talking about. If the cut scenes included on this dvd are all that remain of the so-called ""horror only"" version. They do not show much more. In the ""porno only"" version which, I gather, is this 101 minute dvd, Vampire Countess Irina - sucks the genitalia of both her male and female victims, and yes!, they do not show much, no blood. For example, she goes down on her first male victim, and literally sucks the life out of him, but again they do not show any blood, or the sex act. We are to use our imagination. But I watched the extra scenes of the so-called ""horror only""; and the difference is she sucks there necks, like in traditional vampire movies, and when she lifts her head off her victims her mouth is filled or smeared with blood. Is that it??

So essentially, I preferred this ""porno only"" version. One more thing in the ""horror only"" version she wears a different garment, in other words, she is more covered up. In the porno version she practically walks around nude throughout the entire film. But in these extra scenes she has a garment, and Franco has used them in other places. A garment that covers the front and back but is open on the sides, albeit very sexy.

So again, if the extra scenes contained on this dvd, are all that the horror version consist of, we are not missing that much!!!!!!",1316476800,2,1348,4.409638554216867
1924319,1,6305943818,"OK ... I know a lot of folks are going to think I am just an uneducated and uncultured American, but this movie was HORRIBLE.  I am a HUGE fan of 60s and 70s horror movies and vampire movies in particular and this was neither.

Our heroine(?) seemed to be able to transform herself into a bat and fed on the life force and sexual fluids of her victims (both male and female) but that is where the vampire theme ended.  The last member of the Karnstein family, she believes herself to be cursed and cannot find love without killing her paramours.  OK, now you know about as much of the plot as you are ever going to find out.  No fangs, walking around in the daylight, no fear of religious symbols (which seemed to be mysteriously lacking), none of the traditional vampire traits other than a trail of bodies.

Basically this movie is soft-core porn.  The french title translated roughly to ""The Countess with bare breast"" and our heroine is rarely seen wearing anything except a cape, belt and over-the-knee length boots.  She has 1 other outfit to wear but no one seems to ever notice the fact she is allergic to fabric.  And the shame of it is the love scenes are so horribly done, with the actress'es hair covering her lover's genitalia 90% of the time.  100% of the time would be an improvement because we could actually believe the love scene if it weren't for the times we see a flaccid penis hanging 3-4 inches below her bottom lip.  Bad bad bad editing.

And the storyline?  Well, it is not remotely horror.  There is nothing scary about it!  No frights, no suspense, no mystery, no plot twists, every action can be seen a mile away and by the time it happens you are bored waiting for it to happen.  There seemed to be an investigator and a coroner investigating the murders, but do they ever meet our vampire?  Well, the coroner sees her in her bathtub, but thats all.

I think I have finally found a movie worse than Satan's Cheerleaders.  At least it was camp.",1182038400,10,1972,4.427777777777778
1924320,5,6305943818,"Jess Franco is either the most incompetent director ever or the most avant garde. What to make of his often incomprehenisble edits, is confusion of time (one of his films takes place in the 19th century, but features a car), and his free use of the zoom? But this film is possibly his best, along with the the Awful Dr. Orloff, his first. Like many of Franco's works from this period, the film has a great soundtrack. Lina Romay is no Soledad Miranda, but she is okay as a fluid draining vampire who satiates herself on her lovers blood & sexual fluids. Although the zoom is present, it's not as annoying as in his other films. And this film isn't boring, a condition that afflcits many of his other films. Franco was actually an assistant to Orson Welles on his aborted Don Quixote project. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall to hear Welles talk to Franco!",1178236800,4,857,4.39622641509434

(And by ""charms"" I don't mean acting talent. Her body does all the work for her.) First of all, this is not really a vampire flick. If you are looking for a good vampire movie, search elsewhere; but if you are looking to see a constantly naked and writhing Lena Lomay, then get this Euro-flick. She'll make you forget all about the plot of the movie. (Wait....this movie has no plot to begin with.) Anyway, there are some really good shots of her in this film (some with legs in the ""eagle"" fashion), and throughout the entire movie, she behaves like a nympho on steroids--she just can't get enough. The sex scenes themselves are pretty lousy, but like I said, this film is all about seeing HER.
