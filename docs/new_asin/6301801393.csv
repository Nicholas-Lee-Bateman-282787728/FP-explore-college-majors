7815989,5,6301801393,"A wonderful little gem of a movie. Tom Conti plays a remedial reading teacher in a catholic school; everyone (except Conti) is trying to get the Vatican to recognize the founder of the school as a saint. One day Conti faints and tests indicate he has a brain tumor; later he tumbles from the roof of a building and the tumor disappears. Soon his record player begins playing when the electric is off, red lights turn green when he approaches, and ""miracle fever"" hits the school and community. Conti tries to scoff it all off, declaring that the ""miracles"" are the everyday advancements, minute as they are, that his students make learning how to read. The movie is utterly charming and immensely entertaining in a quiet way. Conti is excellent. Very, very enjoyable.",1110844800,5,767,4.774436090225564
7815990,5,6301801393,"Very nice gentle comedy about miracles that leaves you wanting to see everything Tom Conti has ever been in.  ""Saving Grace"" and ""Miracles"" have a similar feel to them.  I liked this as I watched it, and it's grown on me since.",1066608000,3,227,4.380952380952381
7815991,5,6301801393,"This is an excellent film.  Conti and Mirren shine as two teachers in a Catholic school in Scotland who are trying to decide whether or not to  believe in miracles.  Tom Conti is irreverant, funny and very likeable as a  teacher who has some miraculous things happen to him.  This film was made  in 1986, but still shows Scotland at its beautiful best, and showcases two  delightful actors.  The supporting cast features familiar faces from other  Scottish movies, such as ""Local Hero.""  This is a definite  must-see.",966470400,,517,4.827586206896552
