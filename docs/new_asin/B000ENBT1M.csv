There is a lot to learn just listening to Tony talk about his experiences, techniques, and his style. For example Tony mentions Flatt & Scruggs as an influence and I remember he admitted to occasionally anchoring one of his fingers on the pick guard ( something I am also inclined to do, but frowned upon by some flatpickers ).  I consider myself bluegrass to the core, but I was happy to have Shady Grove played in a minor key--it just gets old real quickly when played in a major key.  Sure enough, I can't see me playing many of Tony's fancy guitar licks anytime real soon.  I wish I could get more into Church Street Blues but seems a bit complex at this point.  I do like his tab for Red Haired Boy and I'm having much better luck with that. But I'll keep the DVD handy for a long time.  I've found lots of good practice will result in slow but sure improvements, and this DVD is a great tool for motivation.",1409702400,2,1105,4.188679245283019
8111568,4,B000ENBT1M,Tony Rice is my husbands idol so I knew I could not go wrong buying this DVD.  Very happy with it!,1342051200,2,98,3.6666666666666665
8111569,5,B000ENBT1M,"I would disagree with some points from the previous reviewer--""Shady Grove"" is typically played in D minor; also, the songs Rice plays here are standards--Church Street Blues, More Pretty Girls, etc. Rice is a more eclectic flat picker than most--I think if you like his style (which I sort of characterize as flat picking that incorporates some jazz technique), then I think you'll benefit from the theory and be able to use that in your own improvisations. However, if you're looking to just learn the standard fiddle tunes, you're probably better off going with Sutton's dvd, or maybe Blake or Kauffman.",1186272000,7,606,5.00990099009901
8111570,2,B000ENBT1M,"First let me say I'm a huge Tony Rice fan who goes to festivals and plays banjo,guitar and mandolin. This dvd is for people who are interested in getting to know Tony Rice but it's NOT for people who might want to learn how to play a ""standard"" bluegrass song they can use. He teaches all of these obscure songs that noone has ever heard of and will not be usable if you are going to a festival. They are songs for people who play at home in the closet (isn't that what's cool about bluegrass?? playing with groups of other bluegrassers?) If I wanted to play alone in the closet I would do fingerstyle guitar , not bluegrass!!! The only ""standards"" are More Pretty Girls than One and he does a song he calls ""Shady Grove"" but  he has changed it so much ( key of D minor !!!!) that it just doesn't sound at all like the Shady Grove we know. So If you want to hear him talk about history and play some artistic obscure songs, go ahead. But if you are trying to learn something USEFUL this will very much dissappoint. It's a shame because if they just would have put 3or 4 standards on it it would be a good dvd.",1177545600,3,1109,4.1342592592592595
