8638203,5,B00I1DNDLG,This is my all time favorite show. I had purchased Series 1-4 and was extremely happy to find there was a Series 5!  It is SO funny.  I love all the actors and the kids are fantastic.  I really hope this show continues.  I purchased a Region Free DVD player so that I could watch this whenever I wanted!,1451952000,,303,4.084745762711864

8638205,4,B00I1DNDLG,"It is bitter-sweet to see these adorable children growing up. As with the 4 other series, I wanted to smack Mom & Dad upside the side of their heads for their parental incompetency, but that is exactly what allows for the high-jinx to ensue. I did not see as much of the improvisational banter between siblings as they did so famously in their earlier years. That was the defining brilliance of the Producers and made the squabbling so realistic. There was some in one of the deleted scenes but it left me wanting for more. All of the cast are fine actors. Ramona Marquez is growing into a lovely young lady. Best of luck to you all. I do not want this show to end. I purchased a region-free Blu-ray player just for this Show. SO WORTH IT. Now excuse me while I cue up for a Series 1 Outnumbered Marathon!
