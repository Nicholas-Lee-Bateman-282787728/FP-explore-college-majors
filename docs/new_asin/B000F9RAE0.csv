8119212,4,B000F9RAE0,"This suffers some lack of credibility factor-hence loss of one star. Bootifull Northumberland scene setting tourism Newcastle landmarks-not enough of the grit and grot of Tyneside, particularly for a cop story. Likewise-some of the relationship setting is a bit far-fetched but none the less there is a warmth that runs through it all all that works. Must be the Tyne! Overall each episode ran a good story-none fell flat or felt laboured-well mabe the last was a bit predictable and annoying. Some great humour, character development and the dialogue/piss takes are sharp and funny. And you know what, it was easy to view and enjoy but probably wise to leave it be after two series. Not much flavour left in the well chewed bone. Probably will watch parts of it again, if nothing else to remind what beautiful places there are in and around Newcastle. Sigh, thanks Tourism Newcastle...eee is that the Angel of the North, look there's Bede's slippers and pipe etc.",1369958400,3,964,4.920245398773006
