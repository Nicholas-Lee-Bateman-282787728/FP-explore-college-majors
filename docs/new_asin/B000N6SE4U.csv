""Smallville"" fans continue to perplex me.  It seems that the majority of ""Smallville"" fans consider what I and those with whom I watch the series have deemed the weakest seasons of the show to be the show's best years.  Similarly, while I found the show's sixth season to be its best since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-One/dp/B00005JLKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season One</a>, most fans have ranked it among the series' worst.  I'm not putting down those who think differently from me, but I have thoroughly evaluated each season and I cannot imagine what these viewers are seeing that I am not.  There are those who are now dreading the next season and the season which may follow (creators Al Gough and Miles Millar have said that the show will run no longer than eight seasons).  After Season Six, however, I am eagerly awaiting more of a show that has, after years of stumbling through piles and piles of mediocrity, finally reached its potential.

In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Five/dp/B000G1R4SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Five</a>, Clark Kent found himself without his most beloved ""guiding light"" when his father died.  The feelings of loneliness grew as his relationship with Lex Luthor crumbled, rebuilt as a bitter rivalry, and Clark was forced to push the love of his life, Lana Lang, away.  To make matters worse, Lana took refuge in Lex's open arms.  By the end of the season, Clark had learned to deal with his grief and had a better sense of who he was, but he still had a long way to go before becoming the Man of Steel.  In Season Six, Clark's destiny grows a lot nearer.  Season Six revolves around Clark's discovery of who he is through two major storylines: 1) the tormented relationship between he and Lana Lang (which should have ended seasons ago and has now reached the point of absurdity), as well as Lana's potentially strong affections for Lex, and 2) Lex Luthor's rapid loss of morality and Clark's realization that he alone can stop him.  There is a third major storyline as well, dealing with a number of alien ghosts which escape from the Phantom Zone in the season premiere; Clark must round them up before they wreak too much havoc.

There are a number of subplots too.  The largest and most popular involves Oliver Queen, played by Justin Hartley, who was cast in the title role of ""Smallville""'s failed spinoff ""Aquaman.""  Queen is a young, attractive businessman who arrives in Metropolis with a dark secret: he is the Green Arrow (one of DC's most popular heroes), a hooded rogue who protects those who need protection.  He is also a sort of Robin Hood - which is bad news for Clark, whose mother is now a full-fledged, popular politician.  Queen also has a checkered past with Lex Luthor, which makes for one of the season's more interesting subplots.  Others include Chloe's relationship with spunky young photographer Jimmy Olsen (played by Aaron Ashmore, whom I personally find extremely irking) and Lois Lane's beginnings in journalism.

I had a number of complaints about Season Five, and even a few seasons before that.  The writing was foolish and predictable and the dialog was just trash.  The acting was lackluster.  The directing was virtually non-existent.  The music was frankly turgid.  The sixth season, however, corrects all of that.  The writing is, for the most part, excellent.  The season's story arcs were intricate and interesting, and more importantly, each individual episode was a blast, well-written and suspenseful.  Thankfully, the writers finally focused a lot less on meteor freaks (in fact, they hardly crop up at all!) and a lot more on other foes, in this case the ""Zoners"" (those who have escaped from the Phantom Zone).  The dialog picked up a lot as well, and felt a whole more natural and realistic than it did in previous seasons.

The acting improved as well.  Tom Welling's Clark seemed rather oafish in the previous season, but in this season, he is Clark Kent once more: strong, brave, and noble.  John Glover is as delectable as ever, and Michael Rosenbaum gets a much-deserved dose of unflinching evil.  Erica Durance begins to show promise as Clark's future love - for example, ""Crimson,"" a fan favorite episode in which Clark is exposed to red kryptonite after a kiss from Lois, who herself has been drugged with a love potion.  Allison Mack is especially fun, and the writers have mercifully saved us from most of her godawful one-liners.  Even Kristen Kreuk, whose character I couldn't stand in previous seasons, improves slightly.

The show picks up some wonderful style from its directors, something it was completely devoid of in Seasons&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four/dp/B0009A5MUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four</a>&nbsp;and Five.  A great example of this is ""Wither,"" which features some stunning visuals.  I don't know what happened to Mark Snow, but his music went from cringeworthy and stale to downright fantastic.  His score is hip, creative, cool, and grandiose, exactly what it should be.  I really enjoyed hearing the music in each episode - even when Snow's theme for the Green Arrow is a painfully obvious rehash of Danny Elfman's theme for Tim Burton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Batman""</a>&nbsp;movies.

As far as the episodes go, this season holds a variety of standouts.  The season premiere, ""Zod,"" is great.  It's not as epic as the fifth season premiere, but it's very cool anyway.  Though I still find the producers' failure to cast an actor as Zod downright despicable, Rosenbaum plays his possession of Lex very well.  Hearing Rosenbaum deliver&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-II/dp/B000IJ79V6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Superman II""</a>'s classic ""Kneel before Zod!"" is really a delight, and the splitting resemblance between the disembodied Zod and Terence Stamp in ""Superman II"" is sure to please fans of the films.  ""Sneeze"" introduces a new power for Clark: super breath.  ""Justice"" is a very fun episode and has been called the best episode of the series by many.  I don't agree in that aspect, but it is very neat to see all the show's past superheroes gathered together.  The inevitable ""It's All In Your Head"" episode comes in the form of ""Labyrinth,"" surprisingly a very enjoyable episode (in a twisted sort of way).  ""Freak"" puts forth the revelation that Chloe herself has some sort of meteor power and has become a meteor freak after being exposed to so much kryptonite.  That's an interesting and tense episode.  ""Promise"" is a painful, dramatic episode, but its successor, the super-violent ""Fight Club""-inspired ""Combat,"" is a real blast.  It's probably one of the show's weaker episodes, but it's also one of its most fun.  Personally, I loved it: seeing Clark dress up in leather and kick the s--- out a jacked-up wrestler, seeing Lois in tight red leather - grand fun to be sure.

""Nemesis"" is one of the series' strongest episodes, in which Clark and Lex are trapped in an underground tunnel and forced to deal with their issues which each other.  Kudos to the writers for thinking this one up.  The dramatic confrontation between Welling and Rosenbaum, Clark and Lex, good and evil, is just superb.  ""Noir,"" unfortunately, is not.  What seemed like a brilliant idea - play the show as though it were a film noir in the 1940s - is interesting, but little more than that, and the final product falls flat on its face.  As always, the season goes out with a bang, a lot of them, with ""Phantom,"" which leaves one character on his way to jail, three characters possibly dead, one superpower revealed, and introduces a character I have long awaited but thought I would never seen on ""Smallville.""  It also featured a much-advertised ""death"" of a major character.  I would like little more than to see that character actually be killed, but the fact that she's not is ridiculously clear.

At its finish, the sixth season of ""Smallville"" is a wonderful surprise.  It's quite possibly the best season since the show's outstanding first, and it's the first season to truly reach its potential since the series' early years.  I have no idea what happened between the end of Season Five and the premiere of Season Six, but everything that was so wrong with the show was drastically improved.  Season Six is quality, comic-bookish, fun television, and although the second half of the season is rather lopsided (""Progeny,"" which features a guest appearance by Lynda Carter, is arguably the most dull episode of the entire show), it's a spectacular season.  Clark has yet to fly, and the show hadn't really flown since the beginning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Three/dp/B0002Y0QV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Three</a>, but with Season Six ""Smallville"" soars as it, like its young hero, seemed destined to from the start.",1180396800,232,9151,5.322199025748087
2757157,5,B000N6SE4U,"I loved season six of ""Smallville"" and will pick up the DVD set the day it is released in September. I think Tom Welling does an excellent job as Clark Kent. The series wouldn't be going into a seventh season if Welling didn't deliver as Clark but he does. The acting has always been a strong point of this series and who doesn't love Alison Mack, Michael Rosenbaum, John Glover, and the rest? ""Justice League"" was an outstanding episode as was ""Combat,"" ""Promise,"" ""Phantom"", and others. I didn't care for ""Static"" very much but that was about the only mediocre episode as far as I am concerned. I can't wait to eventually see Tom Welling don the Superman costume on the final show. Season Seven should be great too.",1180051200,35,717,4.565891472868217
2757158,4,B000N6SE4U,"Like every other season, this one had its ups and downs. It started out feeling rejuvenated and exciting due to the addition of some new characters and interesting plot twists, then halfway through the season, lost some of its steam. For the most part, however, it was quite a fun ride. Season 6 included two of the most exciting events in Smallville's history: the formation of the Justice League, and Lex Luthor finally embracing his dark side and becoming the villian we all know from the comic books. This season was filled with all sorts of juicy storylines with the love triangle between Clark Kent, Lana Lang and Lex Luthor (Who would have ever thought?), and the introduction of Green Arrow as a love interest for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen as a love interest for Chloe. Another exciting guest character this season was the Martian Manhunter, who previously worked for Clark's biological father Jor-El and was sent to aide Clark in his journey. The season ended with quite a bang that left many interesting possible storylines to explore in season 7. The fallout will likely result in one or more characters no longer having recurring roles on the show and a very different Smallville to look forward to next season.",1180051200,42,1223,4.800947867298579
2757159,5,B000N6SE4U,"I know many fans were sick of the Lex and Lana relationship, but it brought good drama for the show. Number one, we get to see more of Lex's dark side and the drama between him and Clark increasing. The fight scenes and the special effects were done quite well in my opinion. As the story continues, Clark ends up in the Phantom Zone while Zod (in Lex's body)tries to wreak havoc upon smallville. The show also intorduces Oliver queen (also known as the Green Arrow) who falls for Clark's future lover Lois Lane. Though the relationship did not last, i really enjoyed the justice league episode. My other favorite was combat. Clark dealing with the phantoms was quite dark , but i wish they could of shown more. There's only about in my opinion two or maybe three weak episodes. But as for the season itself and the finale FIVE STARS! Can't wait for season seven!",1179705600,5,863,4.503184713375796
2757160,4,B000N6SE4U,"Offhand, season 6 is much the same show Smallville has been the previous years, with leaps of logic, poor characterizations, irratic plot development, etc. However there are a few goodies this year that make the overall season worth checking out.

Justin Hartley guests as Green Arrow for the first half of the season. Arrow is everything Clark has not been; decisive, charismatic, and -gasp!- heroic. The special effects show CW can do a full superhero show on a tv budget, and the writers do well when they're not stretching characters over 6+ years. The arc culminates with all the previous guest heroes in a ""Justice League"" episode, which is quite entertaining.

Also entertaining is this year's main storyline of Clark stopping Phantom Zone escapees. They lend a nice twist to the 'freak of the week' staple. Lex Luthor pushes his project of a super-powered army, and a glowing-eyed visitor played by Phil Morris helps Clark. Jimmy Olsen romances Chloe (don't think about the screwy timeline, Aaron Ashmore does a fine job), and a film noir episode shows Smallville's cinematography at its best.

It's a shame so much is dragged down by the Lex/Lana relationship, which hits higher and higher peaks of absurdity as the season progresses. And the adult characters get seriously shortchanged this year - goodbye to Annette O'Toole, as this season is her last. How a show about responsiblity, values, and growing up can continue without both parental figures boggles the mind.

The specs haven't been announced yet, but Smallville dvds in the past have offered 2-3 commentary tracks, loads of deleted scenes, and some featurettes. I hope they also include the 'Justice' online comic, which was a fun side story like the Chloe Chronicles. Check out season 6 for the good and leave the bad, and hang in there for season 7.",1179619200,5,1823,4.967213114754099
2757161,4,B000N6SE4U,"Smallville season 6 starts out where season 5 ended. Zod is still in Lex's body causing havoc on earth. While Clark is trapped in the Phantom Zone. There he meets the hot Rayla (Pascale Hutton) who claims she knew his father and that he sent her to the Phantom Zone when Krpyton was going to explode. She helps him find his way out but when he leaves others follow. He then comfronts Zod and is able to stop him with something Rayla gave him. Lex is of course back to normal with no memory what so ever of what happened with Clark.

  We then get more and more of the depressing Lana and Lex relationship as the season goes on. We get a gross love scene between the two after Lana decides to move in with Lex. She then starts to dress and act like she's this great independent rich girl when she's a free loader. The episode Static is pretty bad too. Where Lex is well, turnt to static and no one can see him. So we get a lot of, where are you Lana, I love you!. Where are you Lex, I love you! It's bound to make you itchy since their relationship is pretty lame.

  Yes it's good that Lana finally sees Lex as the slime ball he is a few episodes before the season finale. But to me their relationship didn't end soon enough. Justin Hartley is at least fresh to the show and saves some of the earlier season episodes as the Green Arrow. He's so good as him that he should've gotten a spin-off series. I mean CW never aired his Aquaman series after all. But the episodes do make Lois look like an idiot. I mean it takes her forever and ever to realize the person she's falling for is the Green Arrow who she despises. With him around though we at least get a good episode that shows him and Lex as kids where he's not too nice to him. We also get a Justice League episode which isn't that bad. We also get some cool appearances by the Martian Manhunter but he's not used as much as the Green Arrow. He's around to help Clark take out the Phantoms.

  Through a lot of the season though Clark has like 2 second fights with the Phantom Zone aliens. I mean his fight with WWE's Batista is even disapointing in Static. We barely even get to see them fighting since the whole episode is about Lex and Lana's love....*pukes*. Anyway Clark's fights with meteor freaks sadly have lasted longer. Bow Wow makes a forgettable appearance as a kid playing basketball that a Phantom goes inside. He even sadly even gives Clark a better fight and kills the hot Rayla ""who I would've loved to seen more of"".Plus what is even sadder is that one of the best fights of the season is Chloe vs...Tori Spelling in a knock-out drag out cat fight. It's not until later in the season where we get a good fight between Clark and WWE's Kane.

  Also in this season Lana finally discovers Clark's secret. Although she's about as slow as Lois with finding out who the Green Arrow is. Actually she's a hell of a lot slower. Clark catches her when she falls through a glass ceiling and she's still basically like....duh...right up until she finally sees him use his powers for herself. She must be slow due to the 1000 concussions. The poor girl!

  Lana is also so slow due to all the concussions that it takes a good ammount of episodes to figure out there's actually no baby inside of her! lol. Yes that's right, Lex makes her think she's pregnant just so she'd marry him. He also lies to her face the entire season basically. She asks, Lex did you have something to do with this ? No Lana. Lex do you have a secret lab ? No Lana. Plus of course in a few episodes we get endings where it's reveiled that Lex was infact incharge of what he said he wasn't incharge of. I mean even an idiot could figure out he was incharge before it was reveiled. Well a viewer anyway because the not so bright Lana didn't see it coming. I mean she thought she could trust Lex more than Clark...haha.

  Lana is also pushed into marrying Lex when Lionel just says he'd kill Clark if she didn't. This is after she sees Clark use his powers too. Yet she's convinced right away that Lionel can kill Clark and stays to marry Lex. She told Clark she'd not marry Lex and that she wants to be with him. So Clark is heart-broken when she actually shows to the wedding. Clark hates Lex more than ever but of course, a few episodes later he's back to saving his life. Lex is trapped in a tunnel and Lionel gets Clark to go help him. Clark gets trapped too though since there's a whole lot of kryptonite down there. So that leaves Clark and Lex alone down there talking about where their friendship went wrong. What Clark doesn't know though is that Lana finally found out that Lex played her and that she wasn't pregnant. So in bad Lana and bad acting mode she was gonna let Lex die down there since she has the only map to how to get out of there.

  Anyway Chloe also finds out that she may infact have powers. We find out in the finale that she can heal with her tear drops. It might've actually drained her of her life though when she heals Lois. It would figure if the show killed the upbeat and the least whiney character. Someone was supposed to die in the finale but I don't think it was Lana. She finally stands up to Lex and gets slapped. So she goes to leave and her truck explodes but I think she's alive and well and faked her death. But I'd prefer if Chloe was still alive any day. Lionel breaks the news to Clark about Lana and Clark goes after Lex who he thinks killed Lana. But a dangerous phantom breaks loose out of one of Lex's labs and takes the form of Clark. So Bizarro is now on Smallville but we get a short fight between him and Clark before the episode ends. Don't worry though, I'm sure Clark will get rid of him in the season premiere just as quick as he got rid of Zod. The show could use more of a villian that isn't Lex but with Zod and Brainiac not used that well I'm sure Bizarro will have a short stay as well.",1179446400,5,5887,4.210479573712256
2757162,4,B000N6SE4U,"Warning!  Spoilers ahead!

For a not-hard-to-locate reason, Season Six of SMALLVILLE was one of the more disappointing for many fans of the show.  What made it harder to take than other seasons?  The romance between Lex and Lana.  I personally remained a fan throughout the entire season, but the whole Lex and Lana possessed a huge ick factor.  Actually, so many things surrounding Lana were unpleasant this season.  It wasn't Kristin Kreuk's fault; she didn't write her storyline.  For instance, she spent most of the season ""pregnant"" but she never seemed to gain weight, even wearing a spectacularly svelte dress at her wedding.  And somehow Lana's being pregnant with another man's child, in particular Lex's child, doesn't seem to loom as an issue for Clark.  From first to last, the whole marriage to Lex thing had an air of unreality to it.

Despite the Lex-Lana marriage, this was a fun season.  Roughly the first half involved the appearance of the show's first full-time superhero, Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow.  Narratively, Oliver, who quickly discovered Clark's secret, talked with Clark about the need to use his powers for the betterment of the world.  Though in the second half of the season Clark did not pick up on the earlier suggestions, it was important in laying out possible future paths for Clark.  Oliver is deeply involved in researching and uncovering a secret laboratory project that Lex is involved with.  This turns out to be working with ""meteor freaks"" and alien DNA in order to produce super empowered soldiers.  This weaves its way in and out of the entire season.

There are also a number of subplots during the season.  Chloe is working fulltime at the Daily Planet, where she is reunited with her old flame James Olsen (played by one half of the Ashmore twins).  Near the end of the season Chloe learns that she is herself a so-called ""meteor freak,"" though only in the finale do we learn what her ability is.  In the cliff-hanging ending, her ability appears to have led to her death, though more likely it is merely her ""death,"" just as Lois ""died"" in the finale, only to be rescued by Chloe's ability.  Another plot over the season is Lana's growing suspicions about Clark's abilities.  Eventually she devises a test that will allow her to see if Clark will come to Chloe's rescue.  When he does, she realizes what some if not what all of his powers are.  In the finale, he begins to tell her what his secret is, only to learn she already knows.  He explains to her what she doesn't know, that he is actually from another planet.  They kiss, but a few minutes later Lana ""dies"" in an explosion.  I've heard no Season Seven spoilers, but I can't imagine anyone actually believes that Lana has left the show.

Season Six, as is usual with the show, introduced a few new pieces of the Superman final portrait.  Clark added a new power, freezing breath, and a new villain, a version of Bizarro Superman with Bizarro Clark.  The final shot of Season Six was a new copy of Clark having his face go all angular.  That is where Season Six will pick up.  Superpower-wise, I hope they finally give Clark the ability to fly.  I'm sure the hold up has been expense.  The super fast running has to be a lot cheaper than flying, but it really is the last major power to add to his repertoire.

All in all I enjoyed this season.  The problem with SMALLVILLE has always been that it has always had a significant number of weak episodes to go along with the good ones.  Low points this season included an episode dealing with immigration issues, with a meteor rock twist, and a film noir episode that simply didn't work on any level.

For a couple of years now I've been an advocate of ending the show SMALLVILLE and restarting it as METROPOLIS.  I continue to feel this way.  I think the show has come close to exhausting what can be done with the Smallville angle.  The show has pretty much set up all that needs to be done to make the transition to the grown up Clark.  The six-season long transformation of the Lex-Clark friendship into enemies is more or less complete.  The only thing left, really, is to find a need to move Clark permanently from Smallville to Metropolis and a way of removing Lana from the show as effectively as possible.  I love Kristin Kreuk and would miss her almost impossible good looks, but the brute fact is that Lois Lane and not Lana Lang is the future.  The future is not quite yet now, but it is definitely soon.  Whatever the long term future of the show, I would very much like to see Season Seven be the end of the series.  My hope is that they would then retool the show into its grown up version.",1179360000,5,4666,4.558363417569193
2757163,5,B000N6SE4U,"This show gets better by the season. Even though the sixth season isn't done airing on the CW yet, it already been my favorite season yet. It all begins witht the season premire episode of ( Zod ) where we pick up after seasons five episode where lex is possessed by General Zod to take over the planet while clark is left helpless for a short while in the Phantom

Zone imprisoned with other criminals who are holding a grudge on Jor-El and takin it out on him. We also see a young Oliver Queen aka ( GREEN ARROW) make several appearances. We also see more of the future justice league members from previous seasons aswell as the Martian Manhunter in human form. Best episode i liked of-course was ( Justice ) featuring five of our heroes. also we see the up-dated S emblem from Superman Returns on the seasons first episode which is also one of the best. another episode to watch is ( Combat ) where clark takes on titan who resembles Doomsday from the comics in the ring. and one more thing is the introduction of Jimmy Olson who will be dating chloe and this season, well someone finally places pieces of clark together.  this show is so great, cant wait for season seven. don't miss out on this great season yet.",1177977600,24,1217,4.404444444444445

2757369,5,B000N6SE4U,"All I can say is wow!!.  This show is epic!!  No other Superman show or movie can compare to the greatness of Smallville.  Infact no other superhero show can compare either.  Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed guaranteed.",1479945600,2,1223,4.6

It's as if the writers couldn't figure out who Lana was anymore or what they wanted to do with her, so towards the end of the season it's as if each episode features a different Lana (I'm not counting the ""Noir"" episode, where this is done on purpose).

The ""Silliest Kryptonite-related episode"" award this season goes to ""Crimson,"" featuring red-kryptonite-laced aphrodisiac lipstick.

DVD features
Disc 1 Green Arrow: The Legend of the Emerald Archer (25 minutes) - A history of the character told via interview clips of folks from DC and others.

Disc 2 Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles - 6 CGI animated clips that add up to a 22 minute origin story for Oliver Queen/Green Arrow [the CGI is very cheap - it would be impossible to get people to buy this separately]
-The Making of ""Smallville Legends...etc""
-Smallville Legends: Justice and Doom - a 5 clip motion comic (without so much motion) featuring the Smallville ""Justice League"" - adds up to 10 minutes

2757765,5,B000N6SE4U,"They say timing is everything, and for me the timing of watching season 6 of Smallville for the first time was perfect.  Why is that?  Because this was the season that introduced their take on Oliver Queen, aka Green Arrow, and I got hooked on the new show about him this last season on TV.

Of course, before we can get to new characters, we have a few cliffhangers to resolve.  While all kinds of chaos is reigning down on the citizens of Earth thanks to the evil force that has taken over Lex Luthers body (Michael Rosenbaum), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) cant do much about it since hes trapped in the Phantom Zone.  While he does escape and manage to save the day, he unwittingly releases the evil prisoners from the Phantom Zone and must spend some time tracking them down this season.

As things return to normal, characters explore new options.  Lois Lane (Erica Durance) and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) become roommates and Lois starts a new career as a reporter for a tabloid.  They also both get new boyfriends in the two new characters that are introduced.  Lois starts dating the previously mentioned Olive Queen (Justin Hartley) while Chloe falls for Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), a young photographer at The Daily Planet.  Lana Lang (Kistin Kreuk), meanwhile, has moved in with Lex and their relationship becomes more serious when she finds out she is pregnant.  Chloe learns a very surprising secret and is reunited with her mom as played by TVs Wonder Woman herself, Lynda Carter.

Other storylines of the season involve Clark and Olivers clashes over how to use their powers for good.  Lex is collecting and hiding people with abilities.  Those storylines clash when we see the first glimpse of the Justice League Smallville style.

This season is really about the young adults.  No one is in college any more (did they all drop out after one season or did they all graduate at lightning speed?)  While Lionel Luther (John Glover) is still around being unclear in his intensions, Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole) is given very little to do.

And before the season is over, one character makes an exit from the show.

I keep hearing from people how the first few seasons were the best and the second half of the show went downhill.  Honestly, I don't see it, at least not yet.  Maybe its because I binge watch a season in a couple of weeks every summer, but I really enjoyed this season.  There were a couple twists I didn't expect, and many of the storylines really drew me in.  Yes, there were a couple clunkers along the way, but I really had fun.  I was watching 3 or 4 episodes at a time on the weekends and still wanting to watch more.

The acting continues to be top notch, which certainly helps.  The cast and writers really know the characters, and so many of the scenes are riveting as a result.  Michael Rosenbaum continues to shine as Lex, but everyone has stepped up their game.  Special praise has to go to Kristin Kreuk who is asked to cover so many different notes, often in the same scene.

I notched the occasional glitch with the special effects, but for the most part they were perfect.  Considering how many effects there are in most episodes and this is a TV budget and time schedule, thats pretty impressive.

And Green Arrow?  He was only in seven or so episodes during the first half of the season, but I really enjoyed getting to see another take on the character and the similarities and differences between the two versions.

The season consisted of twenty-two episodes, and they are collected here on six discs.  The widescreen picture and full surround look and sound great, which is pretty much what youd expect for a current TV show.  The extras consist of deleted scenes and some mobisodes as well as two documentaries.  The one on the superfans of the show is just okay.  But I loved the one about the history of Green Arrow over the years.  Big surprise there, Im sure.

So if youve been holding off on watching more Smallville because youve heard it goes downhill, don't wait any longer.  I found the sixth season to be as good as anything thats come before.",1433721600,,4105,4.6005509641873275

2758140,4,B000N6SE4U,"An improvement over the fifth season, this season starts delving more deeply into the traditional superhero legacies, while simultaneously re-imagining them. I don't know if the producers planned to go ten seasons with this show, but season six serves as a quality midway point for the series overall, transitioning from Smallville into the Superman mythos.

I won't rave too highly about this season; indeed, I think if the episode counts for each season was reduced down to sub-20, it would be a cleaner, less-contrived tale overall. (several subplots and drama get to be redundant and over the top) However, this season moves us forward and gets us back on track. If you were fighting through season five like I was, you should expect improvement.",1384905600,,750,5.048387096774194

2758189,3,B000N6SE4U,I think this is was my least favorite season of Smallville. Clark was too self sacrificing in this season just wanting Lana to be happy and not hurt her. Lana was impossible to like during season 6. How could she forget what a liar Lex was. This is when I started not liking Lana at all and it wasn't until the end of the season that she admits to being wrong about Lex but by then she had made all the wrong decisions. This is the season where I become a Clois fan.  I still love Smallville in general and will always be a fan.,1378425600,,528,4.0285714285714285

2758237,5,B000N6SE4U,"Smallville perhaps is the most under-rated series in cinema history...  The best series of it's genre ever.  In an era where the American identity is being lost, morals and values seem to be on the decline, and patriotism is being challenged - Smallville is what true Americana was and I hope will one day be again...  The actors that made the series successful will forever be immortalized as heroes...

I'm not one to watch reruns unless more the 5 years have gone by or it's been out of my psyche, but smallville epitomizes all that I aspired to be as a kid and that defined me, I just can't get enough of the series.  I will forever continue to watch reruns of this immortal show because it keeps me grounded and reminds me that despite the turmoil in our world today, there is one thing that simply defines and makes the human race what it is - it is the concept of HOPE...  Smallville and Hope are synonymous; Belief in God or in some existential being for purpose in our universe is what defines humanity's will to live and struggle to strive for greater knowledge and good...",1375056000,,1083,4.472081218274112

2758320,3,B000N6SE4U,"Minor spoilers
Considering the series still had a couple seasons before it comes to an end I expected better from this season. It started out great but it just got bad, the worst part was Lex's sudden switch to evil. Lex turning more and more evil was expected but the explanation and quickness of it really hurt the show. Lana became less annoying and actually a good character in the beginning of the season but then got slightly more annoying towards the end. Season 4 had some pretty bad episodes but so did this season. Episode 20, 21 were especially bad which is not something I expected with the season nearing the end. The introduction of Jimmy as a character was done pretty bad too, he was just kind of there for the whole season. One reason I started loving smallville is because of how complex some characters were like Lex and Chloe but in this season both characters seemed to of became more predictable, Lex especially. Another thing is the Justice league was just too lame and corny, I actually cheered for their defeat because of how poorly they were implemented, the green arrow especially. I used to think Pete was a horrible character and he wasn't great but this season introduced a couple characters who were worse and even more forgettable.",1362096000,,1263,4.668161434977579

I don't mind conflict between Clark and Lex but I do not like the conflict to be about Lana.  This is where the story took a turn that I couldn't really enjoy.  It doesn't make sense for Lana to fall for Lex but she does and the whole series becomes about heartache due to this union rather than just plain conflict between good and evil which Clark and Lex represent.

2758393,2,B000N6SE4U,"Well...I don't really like this episode.  I don't really know where it fits into the long-term story arc.  It does show Lex falling deeper into ""evil-ness"" but this epi doesn't really fit...it was just a filler episode.  It is centered on Chloe...a character I do enjoy but not as the ""central"" character of an episode which she was here along with her mother.  I didn't like the actress who played her mother either...Lynda Carter...the actress that played Wonder Woman in the 1970's.  FIrst of all...she didn't age well and to portray her as this 40 something year old today is ludicrous...she's got to be past 60 at this point so her age and the way she looked didn't please me at all...she wasn't a great actress then and she wasn't worthy of being on Smallville today.  This was a mistake...plus...they just blatantly had a continuity error in this epi because previous scenes of Chloe's mother portrayed her as this small, blonde woman.  Lynda Carter is tall and a brunette...not a good match for Chloe's mom.  The only redeemable part of this episode is the scene between Clark and Chloe where he comforts her about the loss of her mom...that's it. I hate saying I don't like an episode...but this is one you can miss and it won't really matter.",1294963200,,1252,4.684931506849315

This highlights the present and future for Clark in terms of relationships. Dammit...why does love have to be heartbreaking???  I enjoyed this episode.",1294876800,,450,4.779220779220779
2758396,2,B000N6SE4U,"I rarely watch this episode because the story is focused on Lana and Lex which I am not a fan of.  There's very little that is enjoyable here.  We see very little of Clark and he's ""alone"" and ""isolated"" which doesn't make me feel great.  I hate seeing an ""isolated"" Clark Kent.  It breaks my heart.  So...not a favorite of mine.",1294876800,,329,4.327868852459017
2758397,4,B000N6SE4U,"First of all, I don't know what it is about this epi, but every time I watch it I get teary eyed at the exact moment...every time.  You'd think I'd get over the bittersweet ending...but it moves me everytime.  Crazy!  I guess I'm a sap or else this means it's just plain old good storytelling.

Despite what I just said, I will forever hate the Lana storyline.  Lana is not a favorite character of mine but I could understand she was Clark's first love and so that meant something. They did have wonderful moments together...some that absolutely take your breath away and also moments that break your heart...all episodes that I do love.  But, the constant whining and the distrust just finally got to me.

I really don't know why there are ""Clana"" fans out there because her character is not one to be lifted up in celebration.  She's a downer to me and rarely makes me smile.  It's Lois that is the uplifting character which is why I'm upset that the season will end soon and we won't have as many Lois and Clark ""moments"" together. Lana's character never really grew or evolved into this truly great, selfless character.  Even towards the end, (season 8) her behavior was purely selfish which resulted in another intense ""moment"" between she and Clark..

But, back to this episode.  I like episodes with Green Arrow in them.  I think its the idea that these episodes are laying down the foundation for the partnership they have in the future...what do they call it...the Justice League of America. I like seeing Clark and Green Arrow interacting and growing together.

I like Smallville precisely because it does lay down this FOUNDATION for Superman and his future relationships/endeavors.  I like seeing the growth that he and his friends go through...which is one reason I wish this series wouldn't end.  The foundation of 10 years of growth for these characters is just setting them up for greater things in the future...but...darn it...no one is going there...at least that I know of.

I also like the fact that with Lana's storyline going in a direction unforeseen, that we are able to see Clark becoming this protective friend towards Lois...even though she balks at the whole idea.  As such, we begin to see the foundation for their relationship.  I am always fascinated and glued to the screen when they are both in a scene together.  The way they fight...it's just pure joy to me LOL.  Sparks fly even though they don't always realize what's going on.  You can see this episode how protective Clark is of Lois but also how he wants her to be happy.  I don't know if either one realizes why...which makes this great TV.  Anyway...I'm rambling.  I enjoyed this epi because of the Lois/Clark/Green Arrow interactions...",1294876800,,2729,4.75531914893617

2758399,5,B000N6SE4U,"I have watched all episodes of Smallville and they are almost always worth the watching in a continuing story - not quite what us older folks remember Superman to be but a great, more current interpretation.  This episode, however, was a treat beyond words.  The cast had the 30's-40's film genre down to the ""T"".  We got to see all of the regulars we enjoy so much and have them really show their talents by going to a dimension that is so, (pardon the expression Clark), ""alien"" to their generation, to what their normal roles are.  It just goes to verify the talent of this cast to be able to pull off ""in my mind at least"" an incredible re-creation of any of a number of old classics. Bravo to all of them!

There's a scene in this episode where Lana Lang Luthor runs up to Clark Kent after he and Lex Luthor escape from some collapsing tunnels.  It's a scene you would see on any big screen...the cinematography for this particular sequence reminded me of some huge budget epic romance movie I've seen on the big screen...it screamed tragic romance and I loved it. Damn...the Lana Lang and Clark Kent story is a sad one, but you can't help but watch...even knowing that eventually Clark will end up with Lois Lane...you just can't help but watch...The sad irony in this particular scene is that Clark went into the tunnels to save the life of his enemy....Lex Luthor.  IF Clark had let him die...he'd have Lana all to himself...and that's where the moral dilemma comes from...Clark always does what is right...even if it means separating himself from the one he loves...Lana Lang...who is now a Luthor.....",1291248000,,1154,4.912820512820513

edited 11 Jan 2011. Just saw this again.  I can imagine the uproar this episode would have had when it originally aired.  It's that powerful.  Even now...it breaks my heart.  I have to say that this is one of the few times that I actually enjoyed Lana Lang's role.  Kristin Kreuk was spot on as was Tom Welling...both of them just broke your heart.

2758413,5,B000N6SE4U,"I think this is one of my favorite episodes. This is an epi that has many story lines going on in one episode and yet it all seems to work out.  How do they do this?  And what's more amazing is that Tom Welling directed this.  He's got talent.  There are a lot of emotions running thru this epi so those that like character based stories will enjoy this one.  A favorite scene of mine is where Lois tries to discover who the Green Arrow is. I don't know how to describe this, I'm not a cinematographer, but the way they filmed those head shots with Lois and Jimmy and Oliver responding to how quickly the Green Arrow left the scene reminds me of an old style movie.  I love it!  There's another scene that I love but won't give away...it's in the Talon apartments and it's fun to watch.  Try it, you'll like it!!!",1291248000,,813,4.2
2758414,4,B000N6SE4U,"You know what I liked about this season.  Chloe finally was firmly planted in as Clark's sidekick and truly best friend. And this relationship is really special because of the feelings she has had for him.  For her to give up on her own feelings for Clark to support him as a friend...is the best kind of friendship a person can have.  This season...Clark really learns to appreciate and depend on her to help him out...she's his girl friday...his side kick.  She will do almost anything to help him out...especially when it comes to being that ""hero"".  She believes in him the way Clark's parents do...It's a good thing.",1290384000,,621,4.660550458715596
2758415,5,B000N6SE4U,"Tom Welling said in a Comic Con interview that he basically saw a different series when season 6 began....which he saw as positive.  I can see what he means.  This is when life became a bit darker and harder and made the series more interesting.  This is when he really loses his friendship with Lex, where he is almost completely separated from Lana, and where he begins to forge an actual friendship with Lois.  Chloe really becomes his sidekick in this season.  Some of my favorite episodes are from this season.  I love the epi Promise where Lana & LEx get married.  How heart breaking was that...but it made for a great episode.  And I also love Hydro where Lois and Clark first kiss and you see an awareness in Clark for Lois that he hadn't ever realized was there.  They don't explore this storyline other than making Lois and Clark actual friends beginning this season...still contentious and witty banter going back and forth but they do become friends little by little. Is an enjoyable season...more so than I think the next one.

Edited 26 Mar 2011: I just saw this and the previous epi again.  I have to say that these last 2 episodes (end of season 5 and epi 1 season 6) are the episodes which cemented my real dislike of the Lana character. The objection that I always had about her was that despite all the good that Clark did, she couldn't see that he truly was a GOOD person.  All she saw was that he never completely opened up to her about things she believed were secretive.  Clark being closed off meant that he was not a person to be trusted in Lana's eyes and I never ""got"" this part of her belief system.  Everyone surrounding Clark, with exception of Lex, were good people and yet she could only see Clark's secretive self.  She couldn't seem to see that other people believed and trusted in Clark and that they considered him to be a good person.  How was this possible?  When she gravitated towards Lex I was outright angry. Even though I knew she would one day be out of the picture and that Lois Lane would be Clark's girlfriend, I still got angry at the way Lana treated Clark...with outright disrespect.  There were moments in season 4 where it was clear to her that Lex could not be trusted but....she still gravitated towards him.  There were moments before she married Lex that she clearly saw Lex lying but she still agreed to marry him?  Again, how is this possible?  I don't give credit to the way Clark broke up with her as reason for her gravitation towards Lex.  Maybe it wasn't poor story writing but instead the writer's desire to show that Lana was not the ONE for Clark because of this weakness in her character.  Even what she does in the few episodes we see her in Season 7 are an indicator, to me, of how wrong she was for Clark and how weak she truly was as a character. This is why I don't understand why people prefer her to Lois.  Don't get me wrong, she and Clark has some great moments together but her core self is not someone that I would like. If anything, there was a real dishonesty in her own self that she didn't seem to recognize.  Anyway, just wanted to say how I dislike her character...at least in this series.",1289779200,4,3173,4.4106529209622

2758431,4,B000N6SE4U,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The sixth season of ""Smallville"" is extremely good, stacking the deck with many truly compelling episodes.  Beginning with the season premiere ""Zod,"" it explores elements of the ""Superman"" saga the show had never before addressed.  As a rule, episodes are solid, though a few characters could have been left out or handled differently.

I'm thinking mainly of the terrible Phantom Zone escapee storyline.  Casting was awful for most of the 'Zoners,' as the show's writers insisted on calling them, being mostly beefy professional wrestlers who could barely act in a style conducive to the show.  As a comparison, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran were absolutely perfect as General Zod, Ursa, and Non, respectively, in the first two ""Superman"" films.  I don't mean to discount the actors here because they happen to be wrestlers because I respect pro wrestling as entertainment and I know what wrestlers' bodies endure.  But in this case it was bad stunt casting.

Shows that work well are ""Promise,"" ""Fallout,"" ""Zod,"" ""Nemesis,"" and ""Arrow,"" among many others.  Shows that didn't pan out well were ""Labyrinth,"" ""Noir,"" and ""Wither,"" among others.  Overall, this is a very solid season highlighted by the arrivals of Jimmy Olsen and Oliver Queen/The Green Arrow in great guest-starring turns by Aaron Ashmore and Justin Hartley, respectively.  Highly recommended.",1271894400,,1396,5.324200913242009

2758435,4,B000N6SE4U,". . . Green arrows, that is.

Justin Hartley joins the regular Smallville cast as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, billionaire business tycoon by day, daring Robin Hood do-gooder by night.

At first I wasn't sure what to think when I heard Green Arrow was going to have a place in Smallville's continuity. Of course, I was, like, ""Hey, cool, another superhero joins the show and this one actually wears his costume!"" Whereas the other part of me was, like, ""What does Green Arrow have to do with Superman growing up, again?"" All I can say without giving anything away is having Green Arrow join the show was a brilliant move. Not only does he demonstrate a good example for Clark, but his past and present conflicts with Lex Luthor also add a nice twist to the storyline.

Of particular note this season was the episode, ""Noir,"" where everything was in black and white and took place in the '30s. Reminded me a bit of the Lois and Clark episode that did the same thing, but Smallville's was much better written and not as cheesy.

The over-arcing storyline of the phantoms that escaped from the Phantom Zone was cool and gave Smallville its trademarked horror-esque twist, but without continually going into Twilight Zone territory like it usually did.

I should add there was one more green element to this season: Martian Manhunter, played by Phil Morris. The only downside, though, was no alien visage but rather his shape-shifted human form instead. Oh well. The budget can only go so far, I suppose. Still, would have been cool if Martian Manhunter had more screen time, but this isn't his series.

The only thing that I didn't like about this season was Lex and Lana getting together. It really bothered me and didn't make much sense when looking back over the first five seasons. This is the reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars.

Recommended.

2758462,5,B000N6SE4U,"Season Review-

After 2 lackluster seasons, Smallville entered its sixth season with yet another epic, action packed, SFX extravaganza ""Zod"".  It's another one of the finest episodes of the series as we see Zod taking Lana hostage as he plans to create a new Krypton on Earth while Clark tries to survive the harsh intergalactic prison that is the Phantom Zone.  The episode ends by setting up the season with promising storylines, but will the writers actually deliver a quality season like they use to? For the most part, they do! While not as on par with the stunning second season and the thrilling third season, the sixth season of Smallville is certainly the series' most consistent season in years.  It saw the writers trying to change the series routine by adding some layers to the series.  One of those changes is the introduction of Oliver Queen.  Known in the DC comics As Green Arrow, the writers re-invent Oliver Queen and his green leather clad alter ego for Smallville and bring a fresh, even epic feel to the series.  Justin Hartley is great as the character as each week he grows stronger in the role. Oliver is also good mentor for Clark at this stage in his life as Oliver introduces the idea of not just saving the people that's close to him or in Smallville, but saving the millions across the world.  It's great watching this kind of interaction between the young heroes as it helps in Clark's journey toward his destiny.  ""Arrow"" is a stellar debut episode for the character filled with tons of gadgets, flying arrows, and action hero fun the series has ever had.  But if that wasn't good enough, this season also features the beginning of the Justice League in probably the best superhero team-up episode in live action, ""Justice"".  It's truly a classic comic book style episode as Clark teams up with Green Arrow when AC (Aquaman), Bart Allen (The Flash) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) return to stop Lex from building an army of meteor freaks. Those aren't only the superheroes that make an appearance this season.  We are also introduced to John Jones aka Martian Manhunter.  While underused for the most part of the season, Phil Morris is quite exceptional as the intergalactic bounty hunter who has been watching over Clark for years and now has finally shown himself so he help him on his journey.

But it's not just a variety of superhero appearances that make this season worth the watch but it's the development of the characters and the storylines that develop throughout.  Lex Luthor is excellent as always as the writers continue to develop this future supervillian.  Lex really shines as the villain this year as his latest project 33.1 has him experimenting on meteor freaks as he plans to from an army.  Michael Rosenbaum continues to add layers to Lex as the writers continue to make Lex into the most fascinating character of the series.  Erica Durance's Lois get probably the best storyline for her character yet as Lois starts taking interest in journalism.  Becoming the amateur reporter for the Inquisitor, watching Lois developing her reporting skills is done nicely.  Then you have Chloe, who is as sharp as ever as Clark's superhero sidekick but it's Chloe's shocking revelation in the stunning episode ""Freak"" that really brings the character into her own again.  As Clark's only parent now, Annette `O Toole's Martha grow stronger as Clark's mother as well as struggling as Kansas' newest senator was great new role for the character.  John Glover is all kinds of brilliance as Lionel Luthor as the character seems to blur the line between good and evil throughout the season.  But the most surprising character development of the season is from none other than Lana! After 2 years of dreading the character, the writers manage to deal with the character in the right way.  With the awful introduction of the Lexana relationship at the end of the fifth season, I was surprised how well the relationship developed Lana's character.  Instead of Lex and Lana acting like soul mates, there was darkness and deception to they're relationship I liked.  It was obvious that the Luthor legacy was having and affect on Lana, making her more aware, even less gullible than she use to be.  You actually feel bad for all the things Lex puts Lana through, as she finds out exactly who Lex is.  Not to mention the fact, Lana finally unravels the truth about Clark in the heartbreaking wedding episode ""Promise"".  Lana's transformation from Girl next door to She-Lex was actually a convincing journey for the character, making the Lexana relationship having reason to be. Lastly, you have the introduction of Jimmy Olsen! While the character much older than he should, Aaron Ashmore has the geeky, lighthearted photographer person down and his developing relationship with Chloe is interesting to watch.

 My only problem with the season is Clark! While the writers give Clark a decent mission throughout the season with stopping the Phantoms that escaped from the Phantom Zone, the storyline is both disappointing and doesn't develop Clark's character.  The Phantoms are lousy villains with a combination of weak writing and lackluster guest stars (Rapper Bow Wow as a super powered nuclear radiator named Baern, WWE star David Bautista as a bone eating Phantom named Aldar and a powerful, ruthless Phantom named Titan played by WWE star Glen Jacobs.)  Instead of developing as a hero, Clark still remained as the love sick farm boy with his occasional hero acts.  But besides that, Season 6 has some superb individual episodes throughout the season: ""Sneeze"" is a fun, light-hearted episode where Clark develops his super breath, ""Crimson"" finds Clark and Lois wrecking havoc on red kryptonite, ""Labyrinth"" is a chilling episode where Clark finds himself powerless while in an insane asylum, Tori Spelling drops by as an over the top reporter in the hilarious ""Hydro"", ""Nemesis"" is a suspenseful episode centered around the Clex rivalry, ""Progeny"" features a memorable appearance from Linda Carter aka Wonder Woman, and then there's ""Phantom"", a strong season ender where the final Phantom turns out to be another classic Superman villain from the mythos. Rather there are the usual garbage episodes: a horrible poison ivy inspired Phantom in ""Wither"", an awful freak of the week episode in ""Static"", another pointless Lana stalker episode ""Trespass"", ""Noir"" is a sub-par tribute to 1940s cinema and ""Subterranean"" could be another runner-up for Smallville's worst episode with Clark protecting an illegal immigrant from a field digging meteor freak!  But unlike the past 2 years, there is a better quality here than there is bad, as Season 6 sees the writers actually developing the characters and the season moves the series a bit forward.  While the Clark still remains stagnant, the rest of the characters and storylines were solid, making this one of Smallville's best seasons.

Season Rating: 8.5/10

Video and Audio Review-

All 22 episodes of Season 6 are clearer and prettier than ever in this widescreen lay out.  The audio is near perfection.

Video and Audio Rating: 9.5/10

Extras-

This box set probably has my favorite collection of extras yet.  ""Green Arrow: Legend of the Emerald Archer"" featurette is an amazing documentary about the comic book history of the Green Arrow with many memorable commentators.  ""Smallville: Big Fans"" featurette is hilarious and very entertaining look on the bizarre, obsessive, yet loyal fan base Smallville has.  ""Smallville Legends: Justice and Doom"" is fun little interactive comic book showing the mini-adventures of Green Arrow and the rest of the Justice League. Although, ""Smallville Legends: the Oliver Queen Chronicles"" is a badly animated group of mini-episodes on Oliver's past, while ""The Making of Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles"" is a decent look at how the creators made this those episodes.  The deleted scenes are another mixed bag of great scenes that should have stayed and pointless material that deserved to be left out. But must admit, my favorite deleted scene is the one where Martian Manhunter finally introduces himself to Clark. Also, the sixth season is the only DVD box set without commentaries, which is very disappointing! I would have loved commentary on ""Zod"", ""Arrow"", ""Justice"", ""Phantom"" and other great episodes throughout this season. At least, have Justin Hartley describe how it was playing Green Arrow!

Characters reverted to previous  seasons incarnations.  Character developments were scrapped totally.  So on and so forth.  This season makes the fourth look like high art and that season had the worst plotline ever, next to Buffy's season 4, oddly enough.

But there are highlights.  Michael Rosenbaum, Alison Mack and John Glover all bring the goods.  And Justin Hartley was also a nice breath of fresh air, although the superhero outfit looked wicked bad.  Tom Welling did the best he could with the material he was given.  As for Kristen Kreuk?  Yikes.

The only major issue is that they covered a lot of ground in this season and did so in a fast paced way. So what could have been some great character developments and interesting story lines got a rushed treatment and left a less that satisfying feeling to some stories. Honestly though when an episode hits it's mark they are stronger than ever.

The season is the first you begin to see Clark's journey into what will become the Christopher Reeve or Dean Cain or Brandon Routh adult Superman.  This is the first season if not only season where Clark doesn't have at least one love interest in the whole season.  His feelings for Lana are still there of course, but he is more focused on 2 things.  Stopping his former friend Lex Luthor's Meteor Infected 33.1 experiments and re capturing and or destroying freed prisoners from the Phantom Zone.  I'm assuming that everyone has seen Season Five and therefore no need in describing what the Phantom Zone is or what happened to Lex.  The key story points of this season are Lex and Lana's relationship and the destruction of that relationship.  Clark's road again to be the adult Superman, Chloe finding out she is meteor infected, Lois' journey to the newspaper field, and Clark and Lex's friendship for all purposes being over.  The stand out thing from season six for me is Lex Luthor's journey into becoming the evil bastard we all know and love to despise.  Michael Rosenbuam's performance of Lex Luthor is right up there with Kevin Spacey in Superman Returns and John Shea in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman as my favorite interruptions of the character.  Michael captures Lex's glib sense that he truly feels he is not doing anything evil.  Also this season continues Lex's streak of loss of women in his life.  He lost his mother in his early teens, he was betrayed and lost Dr. Helen Bryce (Emmanuelle Vaugier) his first wife in Smallville Season Three, and now he has lost Lana Lang his second wife. Which furthers Lex's hunger for power and control.  The video transfer and audio transfer on these Discs are pitch perfect and the special features are not horrible but it should be noted, this is the first season of Smallville not to have any audio commentaries on any episodes.  Other then that a solid Blu Ray Disc set.",1210636800,,2154,4.649076517150395
2758530,5,B000N6SE4U,"This is one of the better seasons as it introduces and brings together many heroes from the DC comics. It introduces the Justice League. The animated Green Arrow chronicles are very good, especially as they went by too fast during the TV airings. The DVD allows you to slow it down and read everything. My only negative comment is that after 6 seasons there is still no commentary by Tom Welling.",1210204800,,396,4.591549295774648
2758531,4,B000N6SE4U,"Smallville is one of my favorite shows.

I was fortunate enough to have the money to buy Seasons 1-5 all at once. I loved every episode with the exception of the Lana Lang/witch storyline (what season was that in?!)

I bought Season 6, and eagerly watched every episode. I was thrilled again.

Now I'm wondering when we'll be able to get Season 7. That darned Writer's Strike really messed up our TV watching.",1209859200,,409,4.575342465753424
2758532,5,B000N6SE4U,"For those of you who love the Superman films and feel the current need of a hero, Smallville and the adventures of Clark Kent fills the bill...",1209859200,,143,4.333333333333333
2758533,5,B000N6SE4U,"As the uneven season seven of the long-running show is nearing an end, it would benefit the writers/producers to look back at season six, a more balanced and satisfying season than the current one. In this thrilling compilation there are some plot elements, started in earlier seasons that really come to a head: the rift between Clark (Tom Welling) and Lex (Michael Rosenbaum)reaches its peak with Lana (Kristen Kruek), becoming the catalyst for division; Lois (Erica Durance) becomes a major player in the story, complete with a romance with newcomer Oliver Queen/The Green Arrow (Justin Hartley); Lionel (John Glover) becomes Clark's ally; and Jor-el (voice of Terrance Stamp) continues to guide Kal-el's quest toward his future role as ""The Man of Steel.""

Season seven boasts some inspired casting: pro-wrestlers Batiska and Kane play Phantom Zone escapees intent on doing bodily harm to ""the last son of Krypton; Torrie Spelling is wicked as meteor freak that uses her abilities to get the scoop on stories, making her a danger to all; former ""Wonder Woman"" Linda Carter guests as Chloe's (the remarkable Allison Mack) mother; and rapper Bow Wow portrays a teen possessed by a phantom that also has designs to rid the world of Clark Kent.

The best episodes are ""Zod,"" ""Arrow,"" ""Reunion,"" ""Hydro,"" ""Noir,"" the popular ""Justice,"" ""Labyrinth,"" ""Crimson,"" ""Freak,"" ""Promise,"" and ""Nemesis.""

Though this season will prove to be the last for Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent, the actress will be featured memorably in several episodes of the season.

This DVD also has some great extras. Because this season saw the introduction of Green Arrow, the DVD has two Arrow features - a CGI ""origin"" and a history of the character - and both are well made. The documentary on fans is just as engaging, providing background on those fans that have elevated the show to cult status.

""Smallville - The Complete Sixth Season"" is, indeed, super, worthy of the show and the legacy of the character.  Hopefully, the eighth season will be just as rewarding.

One can only hope that this year's season finale will recapture the spark of the previous six years, giving just the right ""set-up"" for next season.",1209772800,,2193,5.024793388429752

2758549,5,B000N6SE4U,"What a great start to Season Six with the opening episode that continues with the escape of many criminals from the Phantom Zone.  They are scattered all over the earth and start their spree of killing and destruction. He also has a battle with Zod (who's using Lex's body) to fight Clark and later in the season he has another epic battle with a seriously powerful escapee in Titan.  As he decimates all others that came before him.  In between that you have the Lana/Lex thing going with more drama than a daytime soap opera and Chloe gets her a man in Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) who also works at the Daily Planet along with her.

You also have Lois who has off and on relationship with Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) who also has a few secrets of his own.  Being the Green Arrow fighting crime and going up against Lex.  He's done so much dirt in this season that you fill up the Grand Canyon and still have room for more.  Also a romance (albeit forced) in Lois and Clark when she gets this special lipstick that makes her fall in love with the first guy she sees.  Of course it's gotta be Clark and madness, excitement and drama ensue as they interrupt Lana/Lex's engagement party and drop a secret or two on the other folks who have no idea that Lana is pregnant(there's another story line covering that as well).  Also Clark gets a surprise visit from one Martian Manhunter.

There are loads of excellent episodes rounding out Season 6 of Smallville and if Season 7 is anything like the ending to this one.  Then we are in for one excellent ride with all the characters and a couple situations that will hopely get resolved early on.  Season 6 includes 22 episodes and loads of featurettes on every disc along with deleted scenes from various episodes.

2758551,4,B000N6SE4U,"First off, I want to implore the people who write and produce Smallville to consider doing something similar with Batman. Superman has never been as interesting or as popular a character as his Dark Knight counterpart and the success of this series and Heroes has clearly shown that comics and comic book ideas can garner mainstream attention.

This season of Smallville might be the best since the now modern classic first. The first season's strength lay in the blooming relationship between Clark and Lana and I often marveled at the way the writer and director managed to create such shots of longing whenever the focus was on Clark and his never-quite-getting-the-girl drama. Here, in Season 6, we get great previews of things to come - We get an introduction to The Justice League, the Bizarro Superman, Lex Luthor embracing his evil side, and so much more. There are so many shocks that happen during the season that if I tell you anymore, it will ruin the experience for you, but I guarantee you that the last episode will have you yearning for more. After two weak seasons, Smallville finally hits its stride one more with Season 6.",1207526400,,1141,4.791878172588833

I thought the concept of young Clark Kent just discovering his abilities and the truth about where he really came from interesting.

2758604,5,B000N6SE4U,"It's rare that I review an item that already has so many reviews (and some very fine ones, I might add).  But I just watched the complete Smallville season six over a 3-day period, and I felt compelled to add my comments.

I can't remember when I've enjoyed a series of television so much.  The show had already matured quite well by its fifth season, but this year it really kicked into high gear.  I admit, I was slow to warm up to Oliver Queen and his super alter-ego Green Arrow.  I was thinking, ""C'mon, can't the writers think of enough for Clark to do?""  But by the time Queen brought together all the young Justice Leaguers in the episode ""Justice,"" I knew that I would miss him when he was gone.

And not to take even more away from the future Man of Steel, but two other series regulars really got a chance to grow this year.  Lois was given a love interest, which nicely rounded out some the charater's rougher edges.  And Allison Mack as Chloe had her best year yet, getting a meaty subplot (not to mention a boyfriend) of her own, and becoming more intergral than ever in helping Clark embrace his destiny.

As I said above, I watched the entire season in three days.  So it's hard for me to really pick a single favorite episode.  There's basically 2 or 3 ongoing story arcs, with nary a weak link among them.  As always, the season finale leaves you on the edge of your seat.  In this case, it includes the debut of another super-villain from the comics.

Season six is Smallville at its best. Highly recommended!",1199750400,3,1528,4.387900355871886

We started out with a bang: ZOD. ""Zod"" was an episode of epic proportions! One of the best and most expensive SV episodes ever made, and it was truly stunning. The promise of a better season had come, and we're waiting for it. The first streak of episodes is good, and Oliver/The Green Arrow's relationship with Lois is very nice and subtle. Also, Martha as a senator? Great! Lana was always a horrible and overused character, but this season, she became a character, and not a Clark Kent groupie. By ""Nemesis"", she was ready to do about anything and her trying to kill Lex behind his back and almost killing the other Luthor and....wow. Lana REALLY great into her good self this year. This season also brought many, many amazing best episodes of the series, including ""Zod"", ""Justice"", ""Promise"", and ""Nemesis"".

2758649,5,B000N6SE4U,"I say this in all my reviews if you have not seen any episodes of this season of Smallville please stop reading this and go to someone else's review because I will be telling spoilers all throughout this review.

To begin on all the special features they are many but in my opinion only two of them I found interesting one being the featurette on the hardcore Smallville/Superman fans out there and the history of the Green Arrow which I found very insightful.  For you fans hoping for some audio commentaries on episodes I'm sorry to inform you there isn't any.  The other Special Features are a Behind-The-Scenes of how the Justice League and Green Arrow ()both of whom have major episodes this season) short comic book series was created.  (The ones that aired during the commericials on the CW during Smallville.)  Speaking of the CW I have said it once and will say it again.  Smallville is one of their only two main stay series that the CW would be mad to cancel.  The other one being WWE Smackdown!  I say this because Smallville really held up well against tough odds to stay on the air, competing against other programs on other networks, moving to a brand new network and really deeping the characters.  This season continues Clark's gradually moving toward his destiny a destiny in previous seasons he had been trying to avoid.  The season begins with Clark entering into the infamous ""Phantom Zone"" (a place made famous in the first two Superman films and in the comic books) as a result of being sent there by Zod at the end of year five Clark escapes only to free about thirty different prisioners or as Chloe calls them Zoners from the Phantom Zone.  This sets up the arc that Clark must retrive all the zoners either by killing them or sending them back to the Zone.  This season introduces Superman main stay Jimmy Olson as played by Aarron Ashmore.

This season also deepens Lex Luthor's plunge into evil and how far he'll go to keep the woman in his life probably because Lex recalls what happened to his mother and his tragic loss of his first wife Helen Bryce in season three.  Lana and Lex's relationship also known as ""Lexana"" by fans of Smallville takes center stage.  Since the beginning of the series Lana has always express not wanting to be made a victim by anyone on the series and yet she welcomes that by being involved with Lex because of her anger towards Clark.  As far as Clark goes this season really matures his character with him not being involved with Lana and him being able to stand alone without Lana on day to day basis.  This season also introduces Oliver Queen ""The Green Arrow"" to Smallville.  Played by former Soap actor, Passions star Justin Hartley.  This is the first live action apperience of the Green Arrow.  His relationship with Lois and friendship with Clark are highlights of the season for me.

 My favorite episodes this season are Crimson and The Promise.  Crimson reintroduces Red K back into the series but it also brings to the forefront issues between Lana, Lex, and Clark which was skimmed over a little bit at the end of year five but continued in great detail in this and The Promise episode as well.  Major acting kudos go to Allison Mack (Chloe) Tom Welling (Clark) and finally Michael Rosenbaum (Lex) all three actors mentioned really stepped their game up acting wise with intensity and honesty.

The series really shines in HD.  The series which is shot in 1080p or 720p (which there is no real difference between unless you a fifty inch or larger screen) widescreen (16:9) really pops in color and in sound quality as well as good of not better then in the CW broadcast.  If you own HD-DVD and are Smallville you won't be disappointed I wasn't.",1195084800,2,3719,4.612462006079028
2758650,5,B000N6SE4U,"Like all of the Smallville seasons so far, season 6 is a keeper.  It starts off with Clark trapped in the Phantom Zone, then facing Zod, and then returning the escapees to the Phantom Zone.  Beyond that you see how some of the central characters, especially Lana, begin to really change, and of course we meet the Green Arrow and revisit Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash in what turns out the be the beginnings of the Justice League.  The season ends with Clark in a fight to the death with Bizarro - the last phantom still on Earth.

I truly hope Smallville continues on to at least season 8!",1195084800,3,591,4.394495412844036
2758671,5,B000N6SE4U,I love Smallville and have followed it from Season 1. It just keeps getting better and better. I love the new superheros that are introduced in this new season and some old ones come back. :) Everyone will love this show.,1194998400,,221,4.414634146341464
2758672,4,B000N6SE4U,"I severely went off Smallville for a while, It seemed that the series was never going anywhere. The characters were continually doing circles around each other in every episode. You'd get the pouty looks between Clarke and Lana during discussions abut they're relationship.  Since season 3, roughly 88 episodes give or take a few,  of them being together/not together, it got old!!! It killed itself for me!!! What I hated most was that they created such wonderful stories and managed to undone and dismiss them by the end of that episode.

Story line like Brainiac, who was introduced to us as a big character, just disappeared, popped up at the end, then disappeared for good. Alicia, Clarkes super power girlfiend that they introduce in season 4... killed in the epidose after, in such a lame, pathectic excuse of a story. The bad Kryptonians that arrive at the beginning of season 5 - gone by the end of the episode and everything was back to normal. Just like the beginning of season 6, where Zod had taken over Lex's body and appeared to have started an apocolypse - undone in less than an episode - it was a great shame, cus these stories that they seem to be so scared of, could stretch into 2 or 3 episodes or leave a lasting influence on the future stories.

But having a year or two out has helped a lot, i rejoined the series in season 6 and it had improved on it's typical formula. You still get the filler between scenes where Clarke will be with Lex in an obviously rehersed argument. pout, then go. But dispite these flaws, I still REALLY, REALLY want to LOVE it! The characters have they're great moments, maily Chloe and Lois, who hold the scenes with they're well played characters. I still think they should kill Lana, her character still isn't needed! This series they introduce new main characters - one of which was super hero Green Arrow, who's very welcome to bring a new dimension to the series, that the characters cant do on they're own. I just hope that they do more with long lasting story lines, that span the series. Let's hope, cus season 7 looks to be awesome!
p.s. KILL LANA!",1194912000,3,2110,4.559366754617415
2758673,4,B000N6SE4U,"Smallville Season Six is an inprovement over, what I believe, to have been a sort of low point in the Smallville series (namely Seasons 4 and 5).  Season 6 introduces several new characters, different sides to exsisting ones, and has plenty of great action and acting.  If you are a fan of Smallville you should definitely get this.  If you haven't seen the show before, then you maybe want to think twice about getting this (maybe check out the first and second seasons).  Also, since this is the Blu-Ray version I should note that it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.  Great transfer, crystal clear picture.

Notable Episodes:
(1) Zod - High quality effects and action.
(4) Arrow - Introduces the Green Arrow (DC's version of Robin Hood)
(11) Justice - Brings back Super Heroes from past Season.
(16) Promise - Creative editing and has some great acting.
(17) Combat - Cool action and shows Clark's more vengeful side.
(19) Nemesis - Lots of great Lex and Clark interaction.
(21) Prototype - Great acting and cool plot.
(22) Phantom - The intense finale.",1194739200,,1050,4.773480662983426

2758679,5,B000N6SE4U,"I love this series.  I must admit before I actually start watching Smallville, I was a skeptic.  I was like how can you pull off a whole show about Superman early years and keep it interesting.  After, watching this show for the first time I was hooked.  I was actually seeing how the superman I knew from the movies and comic book, become Superman from Clark Kent.  His relationships with the other characters seems so real.  Then there are the characters you just love so much and then there are those characters that you just hate and want to hit them with a duh stick.  Sometimes it alternates.  When they first brought new characters in I was like oh no, they are going to still the show, but suprisingly, the writers did an excellent, I mean excellent job in keeping the show in perspective and at the same time introduce new links to the Superman series to the Justice League series and how the other characters of the DC Universe fit in.

Now to the HDDVD version.  Can you all say AWESOME!!  I love the fact that watching this show in HD puts me in the show.  The depth and beauty you see while you watching is out of this world. I can't wait until Season 7 is in HD. So I can catch up with the series.  The special features are also awesome.  You get the story of Green Arrow a comic episode of the early Justice League that fits right in to this season. And all the other stuff you expect with Special features like commentaries, production footage, etc.  I am now going to back track and see if they have 1-5 in HD.",1194134400,,1527,4.29020979020979

I have all the seasons DVDs so far, and nothing like that with Tom is on any of them (that I've found so far . . .).  Chloe, Martha, Lois, Lionel Luthor and even some guest stars do interviews or commentary on some episodes, but why not TOM?!  He's the STAR!!!!!!!!  argh.

I am, however, upset with the menu (or lack thereof) of the Smallville Blu-Ray.  When I pop in my other Smallville seasons which are on DVD, I'm welcomed with the theme music and the highlights of that season whizzing by cooly before the menu screen.  The blu-ray doesn't have that.  Other TV shows on Blu-Ray do have such a menu (Weeds, etc).

I don't like the episode selection screen at the bottom of the TV.  I miss the actual menu.

I love the whole series and can't wait for season 7 (Not having CW Channel in the UK, we have to wait till next July to see it!

I absolutely loved the episodes ""Justice"" and ""Combat"", especially seeing Clark fighting and getting covered in blood.  I also love the Green arrow episodes with Justin Hartley. It's amazing he can pull off wearing green leather and a cod-piece!  Ha! Ha! Ha!  And I agree with some forums that ""Yes he should have his own series""
So come on Warner Bros-  give the guy a break!

I would have given 5 stars except for a couple of weak episodes such as ""Noir"" with Jimmy's dreams- just a bit naff and an obvious plot filler where the writers either just wanted to have fun or couldn't think of something new that week.  I didn't care much for ""Subterranean"" either.

I did get to watch all of Season 6 via downloads, but I must say being able to watch this incredible series at my leisure on Blu-Ray was an awesome experience.

As other people have stated picture quality was good, but it did get grainy in certain shots, but that's nothing to deter from the show itself. Sound was really good.

What I found interesting was the little insert that WB put in the package indicating that the Blu-Ray was manufactured to the highest quality possible, yet it was the same HD-DVD transfer that was used.

Or maybe I just need to accept a little less down-home drama and a little more pure superhero action, because this season certainly has plenty of the latter.  It's exciting, properly corny, and very much action/sci-fi. I can't complain about that.

I admit, the Lana/Lex thing got to me a bit, but the writers did make an effort to have it understandable. It was even intriguing!

2758781,4,B000N6SE4U,"With this series, it's a matter of how Clark Kent will become the Superman that he is to be. So each season sees him growing in power and abilities, and we journey with him towards his destiny. So unless the writers screw up big time, you're going to follow this series if you are a fan of Superman.

That said, how was this season six?

This season opener was a bit of a let down. After all the build up in the last season of having Zod possess Lex, the denouement was a bit of an anti-climax.

But I guess we can't just have Lex and Clark duke it out the whole season. There would be lots of continuity and secret identity issues then.

Introducing the Green Arrow and having a proto-JLA makes for interesting storyline, and reinforces the message to Clark that he is meant for bigger things beyond just Smallville and Metropolis.

Other familiar super-powered characters - friend and foe - draws upon the rich legacy of the Superman mythos.

However, I wonder if the writers are painting themselves into a corner by introducing so many of the future characters. While Clark has been trying to keep a low profile to hide his powers, he can't exactly be described as ""mild-mannered"" in this series. The numerous times he has burst into Lex's living room (opening both double doors dramatically!) hardly reflect a mild-mannered character. Lois and Jimmy now already know Clark and the person that he is. How will Clark become ""mild-mannered"" in the future?

The ""noir"" episode shows this up nicely. In the dream sequence, Clark is a mild-mannered reporter, and his portrayal is quite a distance from the confident Clark in the series.

Still, perhaps the series will carve new grounds and new mythos. When superman was re-imagined in the 80s, his adoptive parents survived and was a source of strength and support for him.

In this re-imagining, he loses his adoptive father. Perhaps the future Superman does not hide his true identity from his closest friends like Lois and Jimmy? And they too become part of his strength and support?",1192147200,,2035,4.709859154929577

The episodes in Blu-Ray look better than when they are broadcast in HD on my local CW station, but not much better. I'd say the Blu-Ray transfer for this product isn't as high grade as on some other Blu-Ray discs I've seen. The sharpness and clarity doesn't extend to the backgrounds much of the time in dark or color packed scenes. But I'm pretty darn sure this season looks MUCH better than my standard DVD versions of seasons 1-5 of Smallville.

2758806,5,B000N6SE4U,"I have been a huge fan of Smallville since it's pilot aired in 2001. Who knew at the time that it would last seven years?  So captivating is the story of Superman, the ""strange visitor from another planet,"" that even those who are not die-hard fans get caught up in the myth.
Frankly, however, the myth was getting a little creaky.
I know some fans object to any departure from the beloved back-story told in the comics of the Golden and Silver Ages, but I have read those stories, and I gotta tell ya, only a ten year old would buy it.
I like how Smallville has re-envisioned the myth.  Great pains have been taken to make it credible and consistent within its own universe; consistent, that is, once you accept the premise of an alien with super powers living among us.
There have been moments, I admit, that turned my head, making me say, ""Wait a minute; that's not the way...""  and then, I have to realize that Smallville is doing it better!
Things really started heating up in the sixth season with the introduction of the Justice League, led by Oliver Queen, and the Seventh Season promises even more.  Who said that Superman had to be the first hero?
The more classic mythos is that of the hero's journey to greatness, encountering ""helpers"" along the way, all of whom give him one more ""magical"" implement.  Whether  that's a cloak of invisibility, spear that always hits its mark, a helmet that makes him invincible ... or a crystal that is the gateway to the Phantom Zone (among other properties yet unknown), each gift leads him inexorably toward his destiny.  What was true of Achilles is true of Clark Kent.
Time to let the Golden Age and the Silver Age go, folks.  The mythical framework established long ago is only a bare skeleton and  can be filled out in many different ways for different times and different audiences.
Batman did it; so can Superman.
Even the new film, ""Superman Returns,"" great though it is, still has one foot in the 50's.  Lex Luthor is far more menacing as a corporate magnate who believes what he is doing is right, even though it will result in total devastation for the earth, than he is as a criminal genius.  It also makes him harder to stop.  Powerful men attract powerful allies, not bumbling nincompoops.  It will take more that Superman's physical abilities to contain him, for I doubt that he can be stopped.
Smallville may well determine how the Superman myth is transformed for the Twenty First Century.
And, yes, I do know that much of the series is pure filler.  But, that's to be expected when you have to come up with a new story every episode.  They can't all be attached to the Greater Story.  Sometimes, ya just gotta be entertaining.
But, while we're at this whole revision thing, it may be necessary to lose the acrobat suit.  It may have been impressive in the 30's when acrobats actually dressed that way, but is really kind of silly now.  I kind of like the uniforms Oliver Queen has worked up for the JLA.  If Supes is really as fast as he seems to be, he doesn't have to have his suit under his clothes; he can just go home and change like Batman does.  Smallville's influence on the myth  might be greatest if they can get the hero out of those tights.  (Pause for howls of protest.)  But, I won't insist on it.",1191888000,,3278,4.490725126475548

The DVD really isn't that good. Included are the following features, a documentary of the Green Arrow and how he's developed in the comics, a documentary of sorts about fans of Smallville and the Oliver Queen Chronicles for sprint phones and the Justice and Doom deal that occurred during the season.

Aside from that, some of the episodes boast deleted scenes but that's it! Zero! Zip! Nada! Nothing more! There were good episodes that I would have liked to have had commentary on. Arrow, Labyrinth, Justice, Noir, Phantom, Zod but there are none! Also, there aren't any other blooper reels or any behind the scenes sort of features like they've had with previous seasons.

While a good season, the DVD just doesn't measure up to how I would have liked. While I would definately recommend the season and the series to see a re-envisioning of the Superman mythos I can't recommend the DVD at the current prices. Wait for it to come down a little more in price because there just aren't enough special features to warrant a $40 purchase right now.",1191369600,8,1209,4.747619047619048

Clark and his pals are getting older & more mature now, and other superheroes are showing up like Aquaman and the Green Arrow. And, like my title line says, I think Lois Lane rocks!

Lana no longer a distracting (and overly dramatic) hurdle to Clark moving onward and up, up and away-ward. C.K's/Kal-El's doubts and confusion all but resolved concerning his heritage. And we were center stage for what was to be the battle of the seasons.

What season six brought (rather than the developmental rise to the superhero he's to become) was more typical formula(tic) pap: a great beginning, a great ending and a lot of 'One Tree Hill' filler in-between. And the little development that did occur (other than one added ability and a  temporary cast of 'super friends') was potential  rather than realized. If patience is a super power anyone who's been waiting for anything substantial (to come out of this show) is sure to discover how non-super they are.

2758814,5,B000N6SE4U,"As an adult, I have been surprised to discover that I LOVE this series.  In fact, I own ALL the DVD seasons. It is NOT simply for kids or teens.  There are issues that are covered in the episodes that are inherent to everyone.  The plots are actually somewhat fresh and the acting is superb.  Surprisingly so.  Season 6 is particularly riveting.

That said, I honestly believe that the producers have a problem.  As much as I have waited for it, there simply is no chemistry between Clark (Tom Welling) and Lois (Erica Durance).  Or perhaps it is that the chemistry between Lana (Kristin Kreuk) and Clark is so great that it absolutely overshadows all other relationships.

Erica Durance (Lois) is a terrific young actress.  She is the epitomy of sexiness and enthusiasm...but in my opinion, the chemistry just isn't there with Tom/Clark.  And yet, surprisingly enough, this chemistry abounds between her and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/the Green Arrow).

I just hope that the producers and ""Powers That Be"" of Smallville will leave the romance between Lois and Clark for a distant future and another series.  I'd hate to see them destroy this series by trying to ram this romance down our throats that clearly just isn't there.  They have discovered an amazing chemistry between Lana and Clark.  Let's focus on this romance for now....even though we know that years from now, Lois and Clark are ultimately destined to be together.",1190937600,2,1432,4.8838174273858925
2758845,4,B000N6SE4U,"Season six of Smallville has my vote for the best season of the series yet.  There are finally a lot of guest stars who are worth seeing, primarily in the Justice League episode.  Though why they use ""Impulse"" instead of ""Flash"" bothers me more than a little.  It was excellent to have Green Arrow playing a truly necessary part in the series as a whole by pushing Clark to realize that while he is great at protecting those close to him, there is an entire world full of other people in need.  Seeing Clark move toward his eventual destiny as Superman is something that has been needed for a couple seasons now.

After the disaster of the fifth season, which started off good but plummeted after the craptacular way Pa Kent was killed while Clark simultaneously totally blew things with Lana, this season kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched the discs.  (You see, there is no local CW station for me to watch the series as it airs, so it was a year between seeing new material for me, and this season did not disappoint, even with it's slower episodes.)

As with all TV shows, this season had some forgettable episodes, but most of these were great.  What motivated me not to award five stars, which the season itself truly deserves, is that the DVD set has nothing worth mentioning in terms of special features.  There are deleted scenes from a number of episodes, but there are no commentaries by the creators or stars in the whole set.  I can understand that cast interviews would be a bit repetitive after six seasons, but the commentaries are a favorite of mine.

Anyway, it's a good season to watch, and some of the deleted scenes are good to see as well.  There is not much else to recommend the set, but it is certainly enough for me as it is.",1190851200,2,1759,4.411764705882353

2758849,5,B000N6SE4U,"*Note: Anyone who has not seen the sixth season, I highly recommend NOT reading the back of the box.  If you want to be surprised, the synopsis on the back might ruin something for you.

Most television series tend to be on their down-slope by the time the sixth season rolls around.  Writers usually have trouble coming up with new and inventive stories to keep the audience intrigued.  In fact, I can only think of a handful of shows that are either as good as when they started, or they are actually even better.  It doesn't happen often.  Trust me, after watching television series for over 30 years, I know.  Smallville's writers have succeeded in placing the series in the with the few and far between; the shows that have been able to continue going strong.

The sixth season marks the time and point when Clark finally accepts his destiny.  He finally realizes that he must use his powers to help the people of not only Smallville and the friends he loves, but the world.  Granted he receives a little nudge in that direction from a new ally, but he finally realizes that his destiny far outreaches the boundaries of Smallville.  The challenges that Clark must now face are new, but no less painful and deadly as the challenges he has faced in previous seasons.

Exactly how does one deal with the fact that the love of your life is now with your arch-nemesis?  At least the first half of the season focuses on how Clark deals with Lana being with Lex.  The Clark-Lex rivalry hits full throttle in this season.  We finally see that Lex isn't only manipulative, but he has now added unbridled cruelty to his list of unpleasant characteristics.  Lionel can still play the game, but he wasn't nearly as cruel or vindictive as Lex has become.  Just watch what happens when anyone threatens to take away something that Lex believes is his.  We really start to see a much clearer picture of the Lex Luthor who will ultimately be Superman's greatest enemy.

Clark's new mission this season is to round up the ""ex-cons"" from the Phantom Zone.  He feels that he is responsible as well as feeling that he is the only one capable of stopping them from ravaging Earth.  Clark has a great sense of responsibility.  The writers must be careful not to add too much ""guilt"" ingredient to that, otherwise you're wandering into Spider-Man territory.  Superman's motivation has always been responsibility and a keen sense of justice.

There are many questions that will be asked and answered during the course of this season:  What is Jor-El's true intentions for Clark?  What kind of a person was Jor-El?  What is Lionel Luthor's interest in Clark, and will he prove to be Clark's asset, or downfall?  And how does Clark deal with what potentially proves to be the loss of another loved one?

For those of you who are familiar with DC Comics, a couple more heroes will be revealed, and several others will make another appearance.  Keep an eye out for the Green Arrow and one more famous hero who I will not mention here.  Flash (Impulse), Aquaman, and Cyborg return.  The episode that has them all working together is both fun and exciting.  It also opens the door for possibilities outside of the Smallville storyline.

Tom Welling continues to shine as Clark Kent.  He has rounded out the character so well that he's the best actor to play the role of Clark Kent in television history.  He knows how to deliver a line or even a simple look.  I still feel that many people overlook him.  He also pulls off the naiveness of Clark perfectly.  This is very hard to do, but Tom makes it work.  It is a talent that many of the show's directors have stated that Tom has mastered, and that few actors can pull off.

Michael Rosenbaum, who is the best Lex Luthor, is able to successfully transform Lex to such a degree, that he is able to keep the audience guessing.  For those who have grown with the series and remember Lex when he was a decent guy and a good friend of Clark's, we almost can't believe the things that he is now doing.  The writers ingeniously use this to keep the audience guessing.  Is Lex behind this?  Is it someone else?  Can he possibly be that deplorable?

We've also seen Kristin blossom as an actress.  For now she must show us that by being with Lex, she has adopted certain Lex-like tendencies, whether she's aware of them or not.  Can Lana be just as manipulative as Lex?  How far will she go to the ""dark side?""  In many ways, the character of Lana Lang is a tragic one.  Don't believe me?  Think back to how she was in the first season, and then track where she is now.  Her character is as tragic as that of Lex Luthor.  She's a woman who really only desires one thing: to be loved, and to be loved by the one person that she loves.  Lana has lost almost everyone in her life that mattered to her.  It is not a great leap to consider that a person might become a bit desperate, and thus, run to the arms of the person who appears to shower you with love and affection.  And for Lana, that person is Lex.  But some interesting events will take place to really make Lana think about the decisions that she has made.

One bright addition to the cast is that of Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olson.  We finally get introduced to the young, excitable character that Jimmy has always been depicted as in the films and comics.  He's also Chloe's love interest, but something is amiss for young Jimmy.  He's unable to figure out the relationship dynamic between Chloe and Clark.  Jimmy is not as endearing toward Clark at first.

Justin Hartley is fantastic as Oliver Queen, aka Green Arrow.  He is young, athletic, and has an almost Batman-like detective prowess.  He's also a love interest for Lois.  But can it last?  And where does Green Arrow's history cross paths with Lex?

As with all Smallville seasons, there is yet another cliff-hanger.  It will see the introduction of yet another classic Superman villain.  It will also leave the well-being of several Smallville characters in doubt. The main climax, however, finally comes down; a revelation between two characters that fans have been dying for ever since the very first episode aired.

The writers of this show must be given their credit.  I think Jeph Loeb, especially is responsible for the tremendous success of the show.  As an executive producer and consultant from DC Comics, he knows what will work on the show, and what won't.  He also understands that many things that work in the comic book world don't necessarily translate over to television.  He is able to find the bridge between the two worlds.  Few people are able to do this.  I truly believe that he a big reason why Smallville has remained so successful and a top-quality show.

It isn't hard to imagine why one of America's greatest heroes is fictional and yet has such a tremendous following spanning several generations.  Heck, there is even a town called Metropolis in Illinois dedicated to America's favorite hero.  For a while, Superman has badly needed a face-lift to make him appealing to new generations while keeping the core of the character intact.  Clark is now someone that people can relate to.  He endures many of the same problems that many people and young people face today.  Smallville has continued to make Superman timeless, for the power of good, justice, and decency are badly needed now more than ever before.  In short, the world needs a Superman, and I don't mean the fictional world.  I mean OUR world.

As you finish watching season 6, think of Clark throughout the course of those six seasons.  Remember all of the pains, trials, and tribulations that he has gone through, and yet the core of the character remains intact.  He still tries to see the best in people and his unwavering faith in his friends (often when it is not returned) makes him stand apart from virtually any other person that we know, fictional or not.  Clark always has hope...hope for the world, hope for his friends, and even hope for his enemies.

""Your greatest strength might also be your greatest weakness.  Hope.""--Martha Kent to her son.

I must mention that this DVD has one flaw: no actor commentaries on any of the episodes.  It's a shame.  The commentaries are really good, and I was looking forward to listening to more of them during this season.",1190505600,13,8298,4.599317406143345

The sixth season was just another example of flash over substance, with no real character growth(especially for Clark, who seemed to be more superman-like in season 1 then now).  More Clark pining after Lana, more semi-evil Lex.  I wish they would get it together and come up with a great closure to this series this year and actually let the story evolve to it's natural conclusion.

2758851,5,B000N6SE4U,"Being an avid fan of Smallville, and after owning the series thus far on DVD, and also viewing it on an upconvert player, I decided to purchase the Blu-Ray version, just to see what the differences were between the two formats. After having viewed an episode on blu-ray, I must honestly say that the picture and sound quality was nothing short of amazing. The palette of colors were incredibly vibrant, and the sound in dolby digital 5.1, gave my speakers a definite run for their money. I highly recommend the blu-ray format in favor of the standard edition, provided that those of you who own, or are considering the purchase of a blu-ray player.

The only disappointment that I feel, is that Warner Bros. did not release the other seasons on blu-ray as well. Now I may not be an expert, but I do know about sound and picture quality, and believe me, you will not be disappointed with the hi-def edition of this series.

Bravo Warner Bros... Now please, keep them coming...",1190419200,30,975,4.630057803468208
2758852,4,B000N6SE4U,"Part of what attracted me to this show is that I always find the Superman mythology fascinating and cool and to see their live-action counterparts on screen makes it all the more awesome. However, I always felt its placement on the WB/CW lineup kind of drags the show down in that it repeat a lot of the flaws present on the other soap opera-ish shows the network does a lot. While season 5 was a pretty stellar season with a lot of consistency, season 6 has great moments filled with some new character introductions but they're surrounded by rather lackluster or underwhelming episodes.

The season opens with the premiere ""Zod"" with Clark trapped in the Phantom Zone and Zod having taken over Lex's body who has turned Metropolis into a warzone. Clark, with the help of another Kryptonian named Raya escapes the Zone but not before accidentally unleashing so-called ""Phantoms"" on Earth. Zod is stopped and Clark has to deal with the phantoms while also dealing with some relationship issues.

One of the biggest introductions to this season was Oliver Queen - aka the Green Arrow - with a troubled history with Lex and develops a relationship with Lois. Probably one of the best recurring characters the show has, he's played with tons of charm by Justin Hartley and finally gives Clark a kick in the *** about helping people rather than being whiny about Lana. Speaking of Lana, even though her relationship with Lex takes a big curve away from the comics, it's also developed realistically and it's nice to see the Lutherness rub off on her.

One of the problems with this season is that the episodes surrounding great comic book moments aren't fairly stellar on their own. Martian Manhunter makes some appearances and his first one just happens to be at the end of a bland storyline of Clark's while ""Justice"" sounds cool and it's awesome to see this kind of tagteam action, it also has the flimsiest of plots and rather awful dialogue. However the show gets saved by its predictably-awesome finale ""Phantom"" where it appears several characters bite the big one and Clark takes on the last phantom which turns out to be a classic from of his rogue gallery.

In the special features, there's a featurette dealing with the diehard fans of Smallville. Well, as a personal criticism it runs a little long, but I'm curious as to how reviews like this which praise-but-comment and whether people can overlook flaws. It's probably not their best season but it's certainly a good ride anyway.",1190419200,,2490,4.7972027972027975
2758853,4,B000N6SE4U,"You should buy this season for one reason - the Green Arrow. Forget Clark and his secret and embrace Ollie Queen. No whining, no muss, no fuss, just straight super hero action.

2758854,4,B000N6SE4U,"Here is how season 6 should've been: Clark/Lana relationship/tension/drama is over...for good. Clark is in college and an intern/temp at Daily Planet along with Chloe. There he meets Lois Laine (instead of season 4) who is also in college and on the way to becoming a reporter, instead of a goal free ex army brat who lives off of the Kents. Lana is still on the show but she is a sub character, maybe her relationship with Lex wasn't a bad idea  if the goal was to put an end to her relationship with Clark but the writers screwed it up by bringing Clana back. The friendly rivalry between Clark and Lois wasn't a bad idea either, they need time to fall in love and Clark needs to start working towards his main goal instead of jumping all over the place.

Here is a brief description of how the 6 seasons really were: Clark pining for Lana, Lana pining for Clark, and in between Clark discovers new powers, where he is from, finishes highschool and more pining for Lana and some more of that. I don't know why the writters insist on keeping the Clark/Lana relationship alive after 6 years which should have ended in season 3. That is when it was almost agonizing to watch them together. In every episode they find ways to not to be together, and when they finally get together they screw it up. Enough is enough! It might be too early for Clark to fall in love with Lois Laine at this point, but it doesn't mean that the Clana relationship has to continue being shoved down our throats with complete disregard for the real story of Superman.
I don't have anything against the actress but i completely despise Lana Lang. She is boring, 1 dimentional, docile, incapable of protecting and standing up for herself, even after Lex taught her how to fight seasons ago. She continues playing a victim and begs Clark to trust her over and over again. In season 6 she finally showed potential to have a back bone by going from a victimized charity case to a calculating, self serving, black mailing bad girl, then she went back to playing a victim again. I can't think of a reason why Clark is still in love with her, they have absolutely no chemistry, it is obvious they do it because the script says so. It's understandable that she was his childhood/highschool love, but he is way out of highschool and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.
It is understandable that Lana was his childhood/highschool love but he's been out of highschool for a while now and he is already 20. Time to move on with the real story.
I agree with another viewer that Smallville is all played out and the show needs to take on a new form in Metropolis. Perhaps they need to start a whole new show from scratch without dragging a pointless neverending romance for years and creating filler freak of the week episodes. Hopefully season 7 makes up for what was lost in the last few seasons.",1190332800,,2878,4.459203036053131

After a narrow escape from the prison dimension known as the Phantom Zone, young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) is ready to fulfill his destiny but first he must recapture the escaped Phantom Zone criminals from terrorizing the Earth. Clark's rivalry with nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosembaum) heats up as Lex uses the DNA of kryptonite-infected victims to create a super-powered army. Lana Lang (Kristen Kreuk) becomes the new Mrs. Luthor. Clark also crosses paths with fellow heroes Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) and Martian Manhunter (Phil Morris). Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) rekindles her relationship with the new Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore). Lois Lane (Erica Durance) discovers a new love for investigative journalism.

2758872,5,B000N6SE4U,"I just discovered this series last year and now it's probably my favorite show on T.V. When a co-worker told me it was his only ""can't miss"" show I rented Season One. I was totally hooked and now OWN every season.

Since I watched the whole series in order, the character/plot progression has been fascinating. The relationships and character development really MAKE the show.

Lex and his slow slide to the dark side is more interesting because we see how it happens... how twisted and tragic his upbringing was. Clark's rich relationship with his parents is such a great contrast to Lex and Lionel, (I really missed Johnathan) and his growth toward his ""destiny"" has been so real (relatable even) and compelling.

Smallville has put it's own unique spin on Clark Kent/Superman and that's ok... In fact, it's been great. It seems like some people are so obsessed with the ""Superman myth"" they know, that they can't let go and enjoy... Too bad.

It's been a great ride and I want to see where THIS story goes. Clark and Lana have so much on screen chemistry that I'm halfway expecting my T.V. to start smoking every time they're in the same room! Wanting to see them get together STILL keeps me watching. At this point, it's going to be a tragedy if they DON'T wind up together... and knowing the way that Superman's story is ""supposed"" to go... It's really TOO BAD.

Chloe is a great character that is also unique to Smallville and I love her as Clark's ""sidekick"" and hope she continues to develop. Lois... is an  interesting character too, but as Superman's future soul-mate, she's weak. Clark's relationship and SMOKING HOT chemistry with Lana is so much stronger, I'm really not feeling it with Lois at all. Which is is ok... because this is another unique ""take"" on the story.

But I'm sure at some point they will feel compelled to force these characters into their traditional roles and I'm not sure how they will get there from here.

Having to stomach seeing Lana with Lex was difficult in season six, but I can't think of one episode that I didn't want to watch again. There are very few T.V. series I can say that about.",1189468800,9,2132,4.6068601583113455

Seeing as that is the case, it would be nice if the episodes and characters were consistent.  This is sadly not the case in season 6.  While there were some very, VERY good episodes in this season (""Zod,"" ""Justice,"" and ""Promise"" [""Promise"" actually got me to the point of tears it was so good] being the ones that stick out) the rest of the season was lackluster at best.  I loved the episodes featuring the Green Arrow - they brought a much-needed alternate perspective of right and wrong, and were just plain cool (nice outfit, man).  Other than those few nice episodes, the rest seemed to be repetitive and similar to the ""freak-of-the-week"" episodes of the terrible first season.  I have to say the most dissapointing aspect of this season was the unbelievable, often sporradic character of Lana Lang.  She seemed to change from episode to episode, with no real justice to the Lana I used to love from previous seasons.  There was also the introduction of Jimmy Olsen who is played by Aaron Ashmore.  The acting on his part wasn't too bad, but it seemed that his relationship with Chloe seemed forced at times, and the fact that he only showed up when the writers were in need of a love triangle situation made him seem like a poorly used plot device rather than a fully developed character.  The dialogue often caused groans to erupt in the room (from myself AND friends who watch it with me).  The poorly developed plot and horrible guest stars (sorry to say, but let's face it, pro-wrestlers aren't great actors and we have TWO this season...) and the hardly bearable change in characters in this mainly character-driven show made this season one of the worst in my opinion.  The good episodes were good enough to keep me watching, but the rest either had me laughing at the ridiculous situations and dialogue or groaning at the repitition of it all.

2758917,4,B000N6SE4U,"I, for one, enjoyed Season 6 and after reading some of the reviews, my own take on it is probably in the minority amongst the reviewers if not the general fans.
  While the Justice League material was interesting and I thought the Green Arrow was a particularly strong character with strengths and flaws, I always have enjoyed Smallville for the relationships of the major characters: Clark, Lana, Lex, Chloe, Martha, Lionel, etc.
  I'm definitely not one of these Lana haters as I don't mind declaring Lana is by far my favorite in the show. I do agree with the criticism I often see of her being written as quite slow on the take but unfortunately everyone seems to be blind when it comes to figuring out Clark. How long did it take Chloe? And she was shown Clark catching a car to finally get it. At least Lana figured it out on her own with a clever plot to catch Tom in the act. And Lois, clueless as ever.
  I personally think the acting in the show is fine, all the major characteers are well played, it is an ensemble cast that goes well together. I do miss Jonathan Kent but understand why it was a good series move to have such a major life changing event in Clark's progression to Superman someday.
  Did the major characters progress further during Season 6 - you bet they did. Clark is now firmly locked onto Lex as his major enemy and continues to see what his future life is going to be like, defending good against evil at the expense of his personal life. Lex really advanced into the evil stage, I loved Michael Rosenbaum's masterful take on it all. Lana has finally found out the truth and she responded like most people thought she would of all along (except Clark). She accepted Clark for what he is, regardless. She has now stood up to Lex. I'm sure she isn't dead in the explosion, they've resigned Kristin Kreuk afterall for the upcoming season. To me, the show would not be the same if Michael and Kristin are no longer in it. If Season Seven is the last, I hope they really do a fireworks last season ride!
  For some of these people who rant so much against the show, why don't they watch something else then. Am I happy about everything in the show, no way. But I will continue to stay tuned and enjoy it for all it's many good things.

I would caution any newcomers, though, that this season is by far the most disappointing and viewer berating of any of them so far.  I watched each episode dedicatedly, cringing continuously at the poor dialogue, the unbearably predictable plot lines, and screaming in rage at how the writers have strayed so very far from the end goal of this entire affair.  We are not concerned about the out come of the relationships between these characters.  Everyone who is a Superman buff knows that Lois gets her man and Lana disappears back into whatever void she came from in the end.  The relationships are irrelevant!  What is relevant is the key factors that turn our relucant Clark into our heroic Superman.  The writers are trying to address this in a shoddy manner, tossing more comic book heroes at Clark than anyone can remember the names of, in an effort to get him to realize his full potential.  But in reality, the writers are grasping at straws to keep this dead horse's blood alive and flowing.  They just keep giving us more and more episodes that are only delaying the inevitable.  It is far past time to draw this whole series to a swift and powerful end that will genuinely shock and satisfy its audience.
  And, guys?  Please stop writing like fifth graders.  I've been ten jumps ahead of every script you've written this season.

The Clark/Lana storyline was wiped of all potential after the first season, and mercifully it was brought to a close--- that's about the only positive thing I can say about this season.

The Lex/Lana relationship had incredible potential, it shot off, racing for a few episodes and then just stopped. Fell victim to the same mediocrity that is this shows' downfall.

I watched this show for 6 years hoping to watch the brilliant fall of a tortured billionaire. I was promised a strong, steady, and a believable fall to darkness.

Lex said in either the first or second season that the path to evil isn't a light switch. I was given none of that. We went from a Lex that was open and honest with Lana, distanced from his friendship with Clark to an overnight madman complete with steepled fingers and an evil cackle.

The lead charactor of Clark Kent, played so ably by Tom Welling, has been cast perfectly.  He has grown as an actor over the past six years to the point where one look can bring tears to my eyes.  My only gripe about the series is that Clark doesn't use all of his superpowers yet.  I want him to fly!  Other than that I love the show.",1187481600,7,479,4.325842696629214
2758923,3,B000N6SE4U,"Another year of Smallville finds Clark still stuck on the farm.

In the start of season six we find a grown up Clark determined to pursue Jor-El's teachings within the Fortress of Solitude. With Johnathan Kent's passing and Martha Kent's run as state senator, it leaves Clark little reason to stay in Smallville. But if Clark were to leave Smallville, what's to keep the show going? More importantly, what would become of the rest of the cast? Well never fear, for the writers come up with a rather half-baked idea of rogue phantoms escaping from the Phantom Zone giving Clark yet another reason to stay in Smallville.

Now it'll sound as if I'm totally bashing the sixth season. Rest assured that that's the furthest thing from my mind. The season was well acted, well paced, and overall well played. It's just that this season saw Clark taking a backseat.

Since we know Clark won't move on until the phantom business is over with, we're instead treated to the debacle that is Lex and Lana's marriage.  In between their slew of lies and deceit, we find Lana (surprise surprise) still has strong feelings for Clark. We also learn that Chloe might just be a contestant for the ""wall of weird"" (why it took six seasons to reveal this possibility I'll never know). Lois finally starts working for the Daily Planet. And in between all this, Clark fights some phantoms.

To help spice up the rather dullness that is Clark's life in this season, the last phantom just so happens to be a fan favorite from the Superman mythos. But much like the Clark/Zod confrontation, the villain will probably meet their demise all too quickly at the start of the seventh season.

Despite the rants, this season was entertaining. And being able to view the show in high-def is even more of a thrill. The seventh season just needs to shift that spotlight back on Clark.",1186790400,4,1848,4.688271604938271
2758924,5,B000N6SE4U,"This is the constant struggle over good versuses evil and with this being the struggle between Clark and Lex.... Season 6 is the best. If you know the true story of Superman he had the constant struggle of wanting to be normal but having to except the difference of him being more than that and Season 6 embodies all the development of the characters in the Superman chronicles. We are watching Clark battle his father's nemisis ZOD who wanted to rule Kryton and then we are seeing the evil in Lex develop as well as we got a glimpse from the episode combat where the character was somewhat of the character DOOMSDAY who killed superman in the comics. The introduction of PIZARO was excellent and has set the stage for even more magnificent season 7. The love affair of Clark and Lana is great and will end the right way which will lead Lois Lane, hot shot reporter for the daily planet. Do not try to overbuild the hype of the series for it is very hard for the writers to capture the moment in a heroes life but they have done this excellently. I am hoping that when the series ends will see him enter and leave the fortress of solitude where he completes his training and comes back to metropolis when he is 30 to be roving reporter Clark Kent. The series is excellence!!!",1186444800,4,1275,4.406779661016949
2758925,2,B000N6SE4U,"I love Smallville, but this season reached some new lows. The Lex and Lana triangle started off strong in season 5, with some well written tension between the characters. This season begins with Lana moving in with Lex: a drastic step considering how long it took her to settle down with Clark. Lana undergoes too many personality changes, going from angry, self confident, and downright manipulative to trapped, scared, and helpless in the course of her relationship with Lex. The character seriously needs some kind of consistency. Also, the 5th season hinted at a new and exciting romance with Chloe... why then did they decide to bring back the old and rotting Lana and Clark relationship again?

Additionally the first half of the season was entirely taken over another superhero. Really? Are the writers so plumb out of ideas that they have to make another show? Green Arrow was a good character, but he was a bit over-used. The other new character is Jimmy Olsen. Jimmy is an affable, fun character, but never seemed close to Chloe's intellectual equal.

The plot itself never seemed that fresh and interesting. Last year, we had a dastardly, manipulative alien who acted as Clark's teacher and mentor. This year we get more cookie cutter villains and a somewhat lame plot about aliens from another dimension. Lex's 33.1 plotline about collecting 'freaks' is only slightly more interesting, but strays further out into the bizarre... a bit too far for my taste.

The few highlights included ""Zod"" (great season opener), ""Nemesis"" (finally highlighting Clark and Lex), ""Justice"" (fun comic book fare with many future superheroes), and ""Labyrinth"" (Clark's life is a lie). For me, these were the only really solid episodes. I hope Smallville can fix season 7, but honestly I think the show has gotten stale and should come to its end.",1186444800,8,1839,4.98371335504886

Though I was a little disappointed that the fight between Zod and Clark was so short. I think it should've spanned two episodes at least. I like the episode Combat because it was the first time Clark actually put up a fight against someone as strong as he was; before he got his butt kicked.

As much as there are Lana haters, the show survives on the other 80 percent of viewers that watch for the romance as well. They want Lana and Clark to be together. The writers of the show suck. They are the ones that ruin the Lana character and make her into a moron half the time. Blind, deaf, and dumb Lana walks around like she is oblivious to the world. They stretched the whole, should I tell her thing to way beyond human sanity. Season six was painful to watch and pretty darn dumb at times.

2758953,5,B000N6SE4U,"After watching the entire 5th season of ""Smallville"" and waiting through the long summer break before season 6 begins, I was definitely looking forward to another season of Clark Kent's epic journey on his way to becoming Earth's greatest hero, Superman. There were numerous reasons for my anxiousness regarding this new season, the inclusion of Green Arrow (a popular DC Comics character) and Jimmy Olsen held interesting promise, also the resolution to the Zod plotline that was put into motion in the final episodes of season 5, plus just seeing where the creative minds behind this show were going to take us over the course of this new season. But, with all of my excitement there was a small amount of fear, because during the summer the network that had been the home of ""Smallville"" for 5 years, the WB, merged with UPN to form the new network the CW. This merger put many shows in possible jeopardy, leaving many to wonder what shows from the two networks would survive to make it to the new season. Thankfully, when all was said and done, ""Smallville"" was among the numerous series' from the WB to make it through, and by the end of season 6 had proven itself to be one of the CW networks highest rated shows of the season (no big surprise there).

""Smallville: Season 6"" begins exactly where the 5th season left off, with the Kryptonian villain Zod attempting to take over the world while residing in the body of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). As if Zod's machinations weren't trouble enough, Metropolis is in the middle of deadly riots, Chloe (Allison Mack) is in considerable danger while trying to make her way to safety, Lana (Kristen Kruek) is standing by Lex's side, Martha (Annette O'Toole) and Lois (Erica Durance) awaken to find their plane about to crash, and the one man who has a chance of stopping the chaos, Clark (Tom Welling), is trapped in the Phantom Zone (Kryptonian prison for those who weren't aware). All of this is just in the first episode, throughout the season Clark must deal with his guilt over not being able to stop some of the devastation caused by Zod, while at the same time he discovers that his release from the Phantom Zone has brought some rather unexpected and nasty visitors with it. Lex is feeling somewhat remorseful over his part in the devastation that occurred in Metropolis, but his main concern is the continual manipulation of Lana as she gets closer and closer to him. Lois, however, gets to have some relief from the chaos of the first episode as she begins to fall for a new billionaire in town, Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who just so happens to be the hero known as the Green Arrow, and his reason for being in town is to stop Lex's project 33.1, the construction of an army of super soldiers. Clark and Oliver become friends over time and aid each other in times of need and in their quests to stop Lex's evil schemes from coming to fruition. Along the way Clark and Oliver enlist the aid of some fellow heroes, that Clark has previously had run-ins with, to assist them in destroying one of Lex's most active 33.1 facilities. With all of these events in one season, and many more that I didn't touch on, you'd think that would be enough to keep Clark and company busy, but you'd be wrong, for at the end of the season a new deadly foe is unleashed who is similar to Clark, only a little more bizzare.

""Smallville"" continues to get better and better with each passing season, and this 6th season is no exception. The story arcs for the season were very engrossing, especially the Oliver Queen/Green Arrow arc and the capturing of all the escaped Phantoms from the Phantom Zone. The writers for this series continue to faithfully capture the essence of all the established DC Comics characters that have been on the show all along or have been introduced along the way.

The cast for the show has never been better, all members really deliver great performances this season, not that season's past had been shoddy, but they all really get numerous moments to shine in this season. The new additions of Justin Hartley as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow and Aaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olsen were perfect for their respective parts, bringing new energy and shaking up the show in really interesting and fun ways.

The special effects teams really had their work cut out for them this season, but not surprisingly they rose to the challenge and delivered some really cool visual effects that were fun to watch, especially in the episode 'Justice' where Oliver's team of heroes takes down a 33.1 facility. So many heroes in one episode, with each getting a moment to showcase their power was no doubt fun to write, but was probably a pain to come up with from a special effects standpoint, but the team did a great job, and the episode proved to be one of the best of the season. Two thumbs way up for this department's job on the show.

All of the elements I mentioned in the previous 3 paragraphs combined together are what allows ""Smallville"" to continue to be an entertaining series that just keeps getting better and better. This is definitely a show that lives up to its hype, and is a must-see!

2758955,2,B000N6SE4U,"It's apparent that the producers want to keep Lana center stage even at the expense of the supposed starring super hero.  Smallville has turned into the Lana and Lex show.  The series took a wrong turn the year it prematurely killed off Jonathan Kent.  Next, they developed an inane relationship between Martha and Lionel under the approving eyes of Clark.  Not to mention -- how are Clark and Louis supposed to meet for the first time at the Daily Planet when they've already lived together in Smallville?  This was a terrific show for the first four years, but this last year isn't worth buying.  I don't see how the present writers, directors, producers can bring it back on course.  They need a new team, one that understands the Superman lore -- one that realizes its job is developing the young hero into a superMAN and not keeping a prominent role for Lana.

2758987,3,B000N6SE4U,"Hmmm....I kindof agree with most of the negative comments of the show I have read (for this season only), although I did like subterranean, well at least the last 1 minute of Lex in his dark suit walking the aile of 33.1. I have to admit that I'm beginning to like Lex more than Clark since he has more dimensions to his character, especially when he saves Clark when he was caught under metal in the underground base. I was hoping that Lex would have built his army but was extremely disappointed in the last episode where that last phantom destroyed his army in the lab...What was that all about? Just when I think that Lex is so smart and cunning, something stupid happens to ruin his carefully, intelligently-plotted, laid out plans to take over the world. And what's up with the wedding scene when he breaks down when he kills the doctor because he wants not to lose Lana...Please... If Lex is to rule the world, he has to have a dark 'darth vader' like character, some weakness sure, but not a total breakdown. His character is great, and the actor is fabulous, but please don't turn him into a wimp.

About Lana, I do like her, she seems hotter now than ever, but I too am getting tired of Clark holding on to her. A man of steel with a fragile heart?...Time to kill her off (permanently), or at least put her on the sidelines, being Lex consort again in the future.

I thought the Justice League formation was cool, but having Peter Pan, no-power Green Arrow leading it, just didn't do anything for me. I'm glad they forgot about him in the last ending episodes.

I also am wondering how they are going to pull off putting Clark with the cape and nobody recogning him. Is Clark going to kiss all of them and make them forget (like in Superman II)? I also agree with some comments about having more flight and fight scenes. I didn't care too much about Bizarro at the end...With so many cool, evil characters superman fought, they had to take that one for a season finale? Although I appear to be tearing down Clark, I think his character is well-developed and that the producers chose a great actor (Tom) to play his part.

Overall, I think the writers/producers are doing an excellent job with the series and am looking forward to Season 7 (lucky 7!).",1183161600,2,2260,4.464891041162228
2758988,4,B000N6SE4U,"To begin, I like this show. Can't help it. This is one of the few television series I actually watch with any kind of frequency or deliberation. I enjoy the story, charaters, special effects, and a dozen other things...But like any real fan, I find myself discussing futilely with my family (who are also hooked) what should be changed. The series has gotten progressively darker and unlike in other seasons, the sixth season doesn't seem to have any feel-good episodes to releave the intensity. And also, this close to donning a cape and no one is going to recognize Clark? Time to pick up those glasses! And considering all the powers Clark has now, I wonder why the Robin Hood copycat (aka...) and his team weren't a little more impressed. I mean, he should be so out of their league! Still, I intend to buy it. Though there may be some episodes I woudn't care to watch too many more times, I especially enjoyed ""Sneeze"", ""Rage"", ""Subterranean"", ""Tresspass"", and ""Noir"" (Tom Welling does a great Clumsy Clark). I think ""Justice"" could have been worked a little more but it was good, too. Then there was ""Combat"" which was tough but amazing.

2758989,3,B000N6SE4U,"This season for me was disappointing.  To me this was not ventage Smallville.  The season premiere, the season finale, the wedding, and an episode here and there, were actually ok.  But to me it seems like when Smallville moved to The CW, the graphics weren't even close to last season's.  In this season, the focus was actually more on the supporting characters (Lex, Lana, Chloe, etc.) rather than Clark.  Which is fine, but I just think they should have given them better storylines than what they had.  And I know that The CW network had to have budget cuts, but even the shows they showed in high definition (Smallville, Gilmore Girls, etc.) just looked better last year on The WB than they do on The CW.  I brought that up because the graphics on Smallville just seemed to be used more towards the season premiere and finale and not the rest of the season.  I mean bottomline, this season was disappointing with some of the storylines and the development of the characters wasn't up to the level it should have been.  I mean if it was up to me, I would just download the episodes I enjoyed, and not buy the season 6 box set.  But if you are a die-hard Smallville/Superman fan, then this set is for you.

This season was highly entertaining from start to finish, with darker, more adult themes than previous seasons.  I love the fact that Chloe was made a ""superfreak"" and the introduction of her mother, played by the fabulous Linda Carter was brilliant.  Despite her death at the end of Season Six, I don't really think she's dead... that would be too easy and there was nothing officially released regarding Allison Mack's departure.  BTW, is it too much to ask for Chloe to appear on the cover of one of these DVD box sets?  She may be the only made up character on the series (who was not in the actual Superman mythology before), but c'mon she's important to the series.  I enjoyed Chloe's relationship with Jimmy, as well as Lois' relationship with the Green Arrow.  As far as Clark and Lana, I hope the writers use the seventh (and I think final) season of the series (since Tom Welling, Michael Rosemnbaum, Allison Mack, and Kristin Kreuk are all contracted for seven) to finally wrap up this perpetually pointless romance.  We all know the outcome... I also enjoyed Lex Luther's continuing transition to the dark side.",1180915200,8,1217,4.734597156398104
2758992,3,B000N6SE4U,"I know it's season 6 but c'mon. I know that more than enough people have some gripes about this show by now. They start off good with the Season Premiere. And as usual, once they get your hopes up, they follow up the series with slow, dragging episodes. I think the whole ""I luv Lana, I need Lana, I can't live without Lana,"" thing is pretty old. I know that in the comics Clark and Lana hooked up in Smallville. And she also knows his secret when he becomes Superman. But for goodness sake, Get over the girl already. She has become so annoying in this show. I hope that (Spoiler)she's gone for good, even though we all know, or should now that she ain't dead. She obviously faked it (with the big white truck blocking Luthor, and the screen, from getting to her right before the car blows).

Another thing I hate is how they produce one episode like ""Justice"" which introduces a mini-Justice League to get everybody hype and then leave you out to dry with some bad followup episodes. Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) was stealing the show with some great acting. I think he took the spotlight off of nice ol' Clark. 'Till they got rid of him. It seems like they save all the good stuff for the Season Premieres, one or two good episodes in the middle and the Season Finale. C'mon. That ain't right.

And when is Clark gonna learn to fly. The only time he fly's is when someone takes over his body or he wears that stupid red ring. We are all getting tired of his running around all over the place. And when are they gonna stage some decent fight scenes for good ol' kid-Supes. 1 punch is not good enough for a future Superman. The cinematic style for the show has gotten better but theres not enough ACTION to go with it.

On the bright side. I like Lex. He's cunning and sly and evil. Exactly what Lex should be. This Season could have been good. But it wasn't. I know the finale got everybody hype with Bizarro and all that nonsense. But I'm not falling for that hook again.",1180656000,9,1972,4.324324324324325

Yes we can nitpick at whether or not the writers should have included some of the characters, plot lines, etc... but when you look back, how many of the things from the movies were correct?  This is a different timeline created by different writers, so there are different ideas.  My suggestion is to watch it for yourself and make your own decision.",1180569600,5,629,4.305084745762712
2758995,2,B000N6SE4U,"In truth the show's been going downhill since Season 4. The 5th Season was a little better but Season 6 was an all time low.

Where do I begin from the re-hash of old ideas (Freaks, Red Kryptonite, main character fasking death) to characters acting out of character (Martha, Chloe, CLARK).

The worst thing though is that Clark has actually taken a huge backwards step towards being Superman. I CANNOT SEE THIS BIG DUMB ALIEN BEING THE MAN OF STEEL.

Why...?

He kills... SUPERMAN DOES NOT KILL...!

He still after SIX YEARS pines for Lana... WHAT ABOUT JOHANTHAN KENT DEAD FOR OVER A YEAR & HARDLY MENTIONED!!!

Also he gets upstaged IN HIS OWN SHOW by characters like LAAAANA & The GREEN ARROW.

Another problem is character development.

Yes it's good that Lois is now into journalism BUT PLEASE NOT BY LIGHT SWITCH FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!

Also Lex another character who has seemingly LIGHT SWITCHED to evil!!!

The baby plot line was the most stupid plot line ever conceived in the history of PLOTS all it served to do was to make Lana look like a victim. But I repeat really I'll repeat LANA IS NOT A VICTIM SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH LEX ON HER OWN FREE WILL KNOWING THAT LEX DID SOME SHADY DEALINGS. Either that or the writers want us to think she's stupid!!!

The worst moment of the show though came on the episode Prototype or 6:21 when Martha is leaving to be State Senitor BECAUSE SHE KNOWS A RICH BUSINESSMAN WHO HAPPENS TO KNOW CLARKS SECRET. Clark gives his blessing saying 'That's what Dad would have wanted.' Yes one of the few times Johnathan Kent's name was mentioned!!!

But this is all wrong because remember six years back at a certain Pilot episode & after Clark had saved Lex from the bridge Lex brought Clark a car but JOHNATHAN KENT told Clark to give back the car because... 'WASN'T SAVING A LIFE ENOUGH???'

What a sad pathetic excuse of a SUPERMAN this Clark is becoming I'm sure Johnathan was spining in his grave as Clark gave that sad excuse of a speech!!!

The season really has some real stinkers & some of the worst of the shows entire history!!!

Well here's a list!!!

6:3 Wither- Stupid Vine Lady Phantom who'd just as well be a FOTW!!!

6:7 Rage- Drugs serim episode that's been done over a million times!!!

6:8 Static- One of the worst episodes ever!!!

6:9 Subterranean- Perhaps the worst episode ever!!!!

6:12 Labyrinth- Clark has a trip in his head. Lana tries to kill him. So BDA decides at the end that he must be in love with Lana???

6:14 Tresspass- Yet another Lana stalker episode!!!

6:21 Prototype- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!

And others that were nearly as bad

6:2 Sneeze- Cheesey excuse of an episode just to introduce a super power!!!

6:5 Reunion- Boring Lex & Ollie episode!!

6:6 Fallout- The Bow Wow show= Stupid alien who kills people for no reason at all!!!

6:17 Combat- CLARK KILLS AGAIN!!!

6:18 Progeny- Moya Sullivan comes to Smallville & err... nothing else of importance really happens!!!

That's 11 poor episodes that's half the season.

The rest was ok but there were episodes (a few) that were worth watching!!!

6:1 Zod- Zoooood

6:11 Justic- Cool action!! What show the should be going towards instead of stupid Soap Opera nonsense!!!

6:16 Promise- Cool episode, with interesting format & shock yet interesting ending (AKA Characters moving forward instead of being static like they basically were for this entire season!!!

TO CONCLUDE

Al-Miles please read a comic or at least research on WHAT SUPERMAN IS before you even start thinking of writing a 7th Season...

Season 2, 4, 5 & 6 have DVD's that skip. I haven't  been able to see every show so far. I'm finished buying more Smallville.",1519516800,,290,4.2727272727272725
