8617032,5,B00FMXMRYW,"I can't really explain why I like this show. I ran across an episode of ""Ruby Gloom"" online, and I was hooked. The episodes are mostly light and silly (with a positive message), and the show is primarily aimed at a very young audience. But I get a kick out of the ""horror-cliches-as-normal"" premise. (Besides, where else can you encounter characters with names like ""Malady"" and ""Malaise""?) If you like offbeat cartoons, ""Ruby Gloom"" is worth a watch.",1429833600,,451,4.794871794871795
