8637398,5,B00HZ2N8N2,"I enjoyed this DVD as much as the one before it. Again, it isn't too fancy. I feel like a lot of show and fluff would have gotten in the way of actual instruction like other swimming or workout videos. It's very real and has to-the-point instructions. This video goes more in-depth as to what the children are supposed to be doing in their later progression and it does an excellent job of displaying this as the children seem to already know what they are supposed to do before she even asks. This was even more of a joy to watch as the instructor and older children were still having fun. Though, the little boy was being a little mischievous near the end. However, the instructor showed patience and kept going with the video. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family. It was so fun to watch and learn. I believe I'm going to use this video to teach my friend's little boy how to swim. I can't wait to see him swimming and grinning.",1394582400,,950,4.372881355932203
8637399,5,B00HZ2N8N2,When considering swimming lessons for your child you should feel confident in how you will teach them.  We really liked this DVD. It has great lessons to help you teach your child how to swim. My young nephew watched this with us and he used the ideas it had. We started practicing all the methods with our family and it they work out very well so far. Having formal instruction on basic water safety is one of many benefits to swim lessons. Knowing how to swim and how to keep oneself safe and aware while in and around water is crucial to reducing the possibility of drowning. Its also important to understand that swim lessons are for year-round activities and not just summers in the pool. This 4 disc DVD is really for the whole family to enjoy and learn. It gives you so much information and worth the price.,1394150400,,814,4.426666666666667
