2194255,4,B0006SST1S,"Producer Frank Ross makes his only effort at directing with this feathery comedy, a vanity piece for his wife Joan Caulfield, wherein the lovely and customarily demure actress displays a widened working range disparate from her normal personae, playing here as Dorinda Hatch, feminist author of an anti-male best-seller who becomes unsettled when a rakish photographer for Life Magazine, Bill Shelby (David Niven), attempts to woo her through a sly method of blackmail.  During a picture taking session for the periodical Dorinda does some mugging designed to put the impudent Shelby in his place, but the latter turns the tables on her by using a daft face made by the writer as the proof for an upcoming Life cover, refusing to give the negative to her unless she allows him to kiss her, an act leading to romantic complications that raise doubts as to the sincerity of Dorinda's feminist beliefs.  The work has a simple storyline, with some fatuous scenes of slapstick, but roles are well-performed by all members of the cast, despite a great deal of predictability in the dialogue, Caulfield earning the acting laurels as she and Niven luff toward each other in romantic folly, and there are skillful turns from Henry Jones and Lenore Lonergan as a comedic still in love, although not without conflict.  The action moves briskly with nary a break and producer/director Ross has assembled top-tier technicians to showcase Caulfield, among them James Wong Howe, cinematographer and Orry-Kelly, costumer, in addition to production designer Perry Ferguson, and a terrific score is contributed by Arthur Lange to cap off this pleasant and humourous souffl.",1110240000,,1655,5.144981412639405

2194263,2,B0006SST1S,"2 1/2 stars.  I usually enjoy the off-the-beaten-path oldies that come with Amazon Prime, but despite the A-list talent of David Niven and Joan Caulfield this one's a real stinker.  As a ""screwball comedy"" the bright moments are few and far between and most of what is supposed to be witty comes across as bitter and mean spirited.

There's no discernable romantic magnetism between Niven's and Caulfield's characters.  Instead, they seem to have nothing but spite for each other and take great pleasure in making that obvious.  Even though Niven does seem to be 'phoning it in' I think the B-list scriptwriting is the real culprit.  It's as though the scriptwriters were working up something for the Three Stooges and made as few adaptations as possible once they got the memo that it needed to be a romantic comedy.

In summary, dour old prudes might enjoy the first fifteen minutes of this movie, but even they will throw in the towel once Caulfield starts stripping down from full dress to (quite modest by today's standards) swimwear so she can prove ""The Lady Says No.""",1448755200,4,1075,4.809782608695652

Joan Caulfield does her best but is beaten down by the lackluster and predictable script. I watched this to see a fav actress of mine, Peggy Maley, who looks good and does well in this undistinguished film.
Undistinguished though it is, it may occasion thought about the odd direction modern feminism has taken. Anti-feminist Mona Charen wrote that today's feminism is distinguished by ""a puzzling combination of two things that don't usually go together: man-hating and man-chasing."" Not ""The Lady Says No."" It is feminism selling celibacy -- a more logical stance if one sees men as ""the enemy.""  Of course, there is no erotic alternative as lesbianism is invisible in this film's world. It makes more sense to not have romantic/sexual encounters with men but the emphasis of modern feminism on things like ""abortion rights"" shows they've given up on the possibility of getting women to truly shun men.",1439769600,,1058,5.080459770114943

2194294,5,B0006SST1S,I give this movie 5 stars because I really did enjoy the movie. I love black and white movies I believe this movie made the case for LOVE & MARRIAGE! If it's done in the right way not like the movies they have today. This movie may have been done in a secular way with it's intention of hatred for men. But in the end LOVE wins out and with GOD all things a possible to turn a HEART that is made of STONE! To TURN a heart that can be worked on and made soft and to turn a way ward husband back to his wife. And when there anger there is forgiveness and healing between a husband and his wife or with singles. I believe this movie had some good equalities. If one really tries to find them and not be so judgmental yes the times we're different. But are they really so different today I think we need GOD more TODAY then ever and mens hearts need to be happy and to have peace and joy again. And in knowing GOD really does have GOOD plans for our lives if we give GOD a chance. Just like this movie give it a chance. For those who produced this movie may have not meant for it to be good. But anyway it was a excellent movie to me and I would buy it. To someone else do what your heart tells U to do and if U don't so be it.

2194306,3,B0006SST1S,"I love Joan Caulfield best for her performance in DEAR RUTH; she was never more appealing and lovely than in that wonderful movie. But about THE LADY SAYS NO, I'll say it plain: at best, it's only mildly entertaining. It's not the lead actors' fault, I don't think it is. Caulfield and David Niven do their best with what they're given. What they're given is a lackluster script. It results in a ho-hum screwball romantic comedy.

The shame of it is that the premise is very decent. Caulfield plays standoffish feminist author, Dorinda Hatch, who'd just published a best-selling novel concerning the ""dangers"" of men. Sleek photographer Bill Shelby (Niven) arrives to shoot her for the cover of Life magazine, and he's instantly smitten. But each of Bill's advances is met with a snub. Ironically, it's not until he gets discouraged and turns away that the snooty Dorinda has a change of heart. There's a strong whiff of THEODORA GOES WILD, a screwball comedy in which the prim and proper Irene Dunne goes on a bender and lets her hair down. Caulfield serves up her own spin of the good girl gone wild, as she channels her inner Dunne and tears the roof off a nightclub, sets dude against dude, starts a ruckus, wrecks a marriage. It's just that Caulfield's light touch isn't as light as Irene Dunne's. Still, it's fun watching the normally demure Caulfield play the foxy maneater.

For me, the heavyhanded ""comic"" sequences outweigh the good moments. The role-playing bit - in which Caulfield punishes Niven for wolf whistling as a bunch of old biddies appreciatively look on - relies on unfunny sight gags. As I understand the lesson, wolf whistling will result in one's tie getting snipped off and pie smushed onto one's face. Well, maybe if you wolf whistle at a clown. Worth watching - because it's so damn odd - is Caulfield's dream in which she's in a leopard print bikini and, in front of Niven, performs these weird gyrating motions or, as she likes to call it, dancing. The film climaxes to a tepid crescendo, with Caulfield attempting to mend the marriage she'd sabotaged. Maybe it was a sign of the times, but the big swerve is that Caulfield recants her man-hating views and opens herself to romance. THE LADY SAYS NO, when you boil it down, is pretty much a listless raspberry at feminism circa 1952. This picture is a lightweight effort, with a screenplay that's low on finesse and tired humor that half the time had me rolling my eyes. That I'm rating it 3 stars out of 5 is more because of the good will Joan Caulfield's generated from DEAR RUTH than because of her performance in this one, which is only okay. It's hard to sparkle when you're given subpar material. Why is there a DVD out on this film, while a gem like DEAR RUTH is still languishing in VHS limbo?",1303344000,8,2782,4.640973630831643

8042861,4,B0006SST1S,"I have very mixed feelings about this film...
On one hand it IS a rom-com so don't expect much out of it, by todays standards in fact for puff-pastry (at best) rom-coms this would probably be a nice quaint addition to the inexhaustible manufactured rom-coms of today.

The plot is actually very stereotypical disney attraction-veiled-through-antagonism plot that many rom-coms will go to if not the love at first sight.
In this case it makes fun of the strong independent woman who falls for the worldly and player type (who eventually changes into the soft and sensitive type after meeting the only strong independent woman hes ever met in his life). Sound familiar? (Heres looking at The Ugly Truth, Back-up plan, and tiring cliched rom-coms now.)

What this movie simply did was set the pace for the seemingly 1-of-2 roads that all rom-coms after it would follow: Path 1: Love at first sight, or Path 2: Love at first sight disguised as irritation at first sight.

No its not some revolutionary or academy worthy movie, but Rom-Coms are not supposed to be that! They are simply puff-pastry films that are meant to be guilty pleasures and provide light entertainment, which this does in spades.
Breakdown of Score:
2-Stars for: The overall cast, not too mention both leading actors. Everyones timing and delivery didn't seem over played and if we were comparing the acting to the factory churned out (in particular Hallmark holiday rom-coms) actors in most rom-coms this is a sparkling little gem.

1-star for the: Script. Ill agree the script isn't sublime, but there is a dry wit/sarcastic humor that all the actors, not least of all Niven, bring to their lines which really helps polish the script to acceptable levels of humor. Read P.G. Wodehouse and you get a few sparkling and well timed and delivered sarcastic quips maybe not even between the two leads, but more side comments to the supporting cast.

1-Star for: Niven, yes Im a fan, but his performance does really help boost this to a fun little light hearted comedy. I get tired of Rom-coms that attempt to be equal parts drama/comedy/and sentimental (*gag, Something Borrowed or Hes Just Not That Into You, any-Jennifer-Lopez-romantic-comedy-movie). This movie attempts to be nothing more than what it is: a romantic comedy. So what if the characters are 1-dimensional?  Caudfield doesnt have some sob-backstory where she is internally struggling with whatever that drives her character.
Niven isn't propelled by anything much -even Caufield- and turns out to be simply an easy-come-easy-go type of character that is a playboy but just as easily can be sincere (well as sincere as any typical supporting male lead in rom-coms can be).

Its predictable, its funny -enough-, and its overall a pretty modern rom-com (which I mean to say uses all the tired old cliches or rom-coms) as you can get set in the backdrop of 1950s. That being said...

My mixed feelings come from the 1950s charm or ideals the film had when it came to playing-hard-to-get. Yes, there is one particular scene in the movie where Caufield lectures on wolf-whistling which is meant to be easy slap stick gag comedy. Actually I found the antics to be quite funny to a certain degree -and yes Im a feminist, but also that doesnt mean I don't have a fair sense of humor. On a deeper level this scene, besides the premise of the movie itself, is definitely a worrying concern that if not seen in a reasonable way can offend both extremes on either or of the spectrum (in regards to gender roles). The scene where Caufield retaliates in over exaggerated ways to being wolf whistled is funny, but is simply a case of: what if the guy hitting on me is creepy and Im not attracted to him vs. If I was attracted to him type of humor (which the YouTube channel Wongfu actually pretty fairly makes a good sketch on.)
Again this film was not trying to be over though provoking or raise awareness to harassment, it was simply meant to provide some cheap laughs and quick feel-good feelings -which is the overall goal of EVERY SINGLE ROMANTIC COMEDY.

Yes the gender roles are rather overwhelming sometimes, but this film was made in the 1950s where gender roles were over oppressive. The female lead a bit too stereotypically female (shes just on her time of the month again and her little female brain is too indecisive to begin with, all she needs is a forceful male to lead her). But still...
For an OLD 1950s film it still has its place as a funny little pace-setter for future rom-coms to come. Sure it has some terrible assumptions about gender roles, but in many ways it still sets itself apart from the rom-coms today. I may not ever buy it for the price right now of $7.99, but for maybe $5 Id add it to my old film collection. Its cute and sweet, and a solid enough cast to still make it funny and worth the rewatch maybe every year or two.
If you don't like this film definitely don't check out Underneath the Yum Yum Tree with Jack Lemmon and Dean Jones! But overall I found The Lady Says No to be hilarious, maybe more so than it even had meant to be bc of its outdated assumptions on gender roles (gotta gte a sense of humor people!)",1514592000,,5170,4.678767876787679

In one funny scene, the young lady demonstrates to a room full of women--most of whom would not need to know--how to react to a man's catcalls. She proceeds to punish the photographer who is the stand in for the catcaller. He takes it like a perfect gentleman--showing tacitly how unlikely her techniques would be with the less refined person who would catcall and how unfair she is to the photographer and to men in general.  The plot development is predictable.  It is not giving anything away to say that eventually, the young lady comes to have feelings.",1484438400,,890,4.803921568627451
