886308,5,6304488319,"This movie's release in the US is long overdue! I had the pleasure of seeing it in Lyon, France while studying abroad in the Summer of 1996.  A wonderful, touching film about a man whose ""regular"" life falls  to pieces, and is saved by a troubled, yet optimistic young man with Down  Syndrome.  Powerful, and easy to follow, even for the beginning French  speaker.",924652800,2,364,4.625

886406,5,6304488319,"... from the moment you see a character with Down's Syndrome identifying with a tv history of Mongolia, until Spanish crooner Luis Mariano serenades him on a sweet chocolate trip out of time.

I'm glad to see all the good reviews. I thought I was the only American who had ever seen this movie, but apparently it's left its mark on a few others. Auteil is wonderful as always, and Pascal Duquenne is remarkable. I believe the two of them shared that year's best actor prize at Cannes.

Please, please, please put this film out on region 1 DVD!",1197072000,2,543,4.474747474747475
886407,5,6304488319,"If you have any doubts concerning the power and beauty of this film, simply read the other reviews posted here. Yes, this film trully lives up to that hype and more. But when will they come out with a region 1 dvd release? We here in region one are not all french-hating neanderthals, incabable of accepting beautiful art whilst stuffing our bloated jowels with ""Freedom Fries"". Ahahaha. Yes, if only we here in 'region 1' could have more wondrous examples such as Georges, (played with unflinching realism by the great Pascal Duquenne) we could have our cold, self-obsessed hearts warmed and opened to the beauty in the world.
I was somewhat expecting a ""10 year anniversary edition"" to come out here in the year of our Lord, 2007. After all, this film swept the Cannes in '97, and is touted as ""the #1 movie in europe"". Good enough reason to keep it away from American audiences I suppose. But isn't French Canada in region 1? They could at least put this out for our cannuck buddies in Quebec you'd think? Ah well, such are the times. When filth incessantly rises to the top and is flogged for every last money-grubbing shekel, and beauty and truth inevitably get swept under the carpet and forgotten.
Feel free to comment if you have anything to add to this discussion, or if you know if or when a region 1 release is in the works, thank you, sal.",1194912000,4,1351,4.540983606557377
886408,5,6304488319,"Although being fluent in French is almost a prerequisite to watch this movie, it's something that anyone with an interest in intelligent and emotive drama should see. The direction is for the most part light and sure, with the actors given the opportunity to convey pathos, optimism, pain, and regret without the imposition of treacly sound tracks or hackneyed editing.  Hollywood will never be capable of making movies like this, and we can only be thankful that the French invest in their movie industry because periodically it turns out gems like le huitieme jour (which means ""the eighth day"" - a reference to the Judeo-Christian notion that their god made the world in seven days; on the eighth day he accomplished lesser, flawed, work).

Harry is a classic single-minded salesman whose marriage is in tatters; yet he's not heartless - he's simply become caught up in the rat-race.  When he forgets to collect his children from the train station, the shock and remorse he feels is powerfully conveyed and we grieve with him that it's too late.  As he drives home his guilt leads him to close his eyes and take his hands off the steering wheel.  It's a moment of tremendous pain and occurs sotto-voce so we feel it all the more.

Harry, needless to say, doesn't die.  Instead he hits something and thus begins his encounter with Georges, a Downs-syndrome man who is on a quest to find his mother.  In reality his quest is to find himself and Harry, though initially reluctant to saddle himself with the responsibility, comes to befriend him.

Of course this is a classic ""finding yourself"" movie in which Harry discovers humanity through witnessing the travails of Georges.  But unlike a traditional syrupy Hollywood movie, there's at best an ambiguous ending.  Georges does indeed discover himself, and thereby discovers how great and ineluctable a gap exists between his dreams and harsh reality.  While Harry and Georges are eating at a diner, with Georges wearing his sunglasses which effectively disguise his condition, the waitress flirts with him.  Georges, an open-hearted soul who is also a man with wants and desires, responds happily... only to be crushed when the waitress sees him for what he is and rejects him brusquely.

Georges' end is shown without sentiment, and is all the more affecting because of the crisp direction and well-considered camera angles.  And Harry's grief pushes him to make one last effort to regain the hearts of his children.

The acting is first-class, the direction assured, and the overall treatment of the themes is weighty enough to engage the viewer from first to last, without being over-wrought or histrionic.  If you only watch one ""foreign"" movie this year, make this the one to see.",1156636800,12,2737,4.941048034934497
886409,5,6304488319,"There is absolutely nothing more to say about it.

886410,5,6304488319,I am 13 and a few months and i saw this in french class now i'm searching the internet for this movie.  It is the best movie That has been done.

886411,5,6304488319,"Once in a while a unique film comes along that touches the heart strings.  The EIGHTH DAY will make you laugh and make you cry.  It has been compared to the French version of RAIN MAN.  However, it is not similar at all unless you make extreme comparisons to the physical disparity, Down's Syndrome, that George, one of the main characters, possesses to that of Dustin Hoffman's Autism and his friend,Harry, a father-like figure, to Tom Cruise's character.  Other than that, that's where the comparisons end.

EIGHTH DAY brings two completely different people together as they work through their own separate but similar situations.  George is not at all absent-minded and is aware of his surroundings, but he holds on to his happy memories of his late mother.  In reality, he has to grip with tensions between his older sister and her husband, and the fact that she can no longer take care of him; she has no choice but to confine him to a home.  As for Harry, he is fighting to have the right to see his daughters.  He too is left out in the cold as his wife refuses him the right.  Through some strange occurrence, George running away from the home, and Harry driving along, George and Harry befriend each other despite the numerous trials they face along the way.

EIGHTH DAY is a simple film without flashy scenes.  The English subtitles are helpful but not necessary because the character's actions basically speak for themselves.  There are high points in the film, the dream-like scenes that George had of his mother, and low points where Harry attempts to abandon George.  Overall, this is a recommended film for those want to see an excellent film about friendship.",1113782400,10,1675,4.731034482758621

886453,5,6304488319,"This film presents in a very unique way what is truly important in life. Although some speculation may lead one to the conclusion that the film promotes a rather egocentric approach to life (from the view of George, not Harry), it shows what a litte bit of self-love and imagination can do when put to good use. The more affectionate side of male friendship, quite distinct from homosexuality, which is rarely illustrated in films, was also very refreshing. An excellent movie for beginning French students, at that.",1103846400,2,516,4.942528735632184
886454,5,6304488319,"Incredibly pleased that the French got stuffed in the Football World Cup 2002 and were sufficently embarrased by my compatriots in The Rugby World Cup of 2003 and looking forward to their impending defeat in EURO 2004.  The fact that they are taking are taking a jolly good drubbing in the field of sports should not detract from their superb filmaking abilities.  This movie- made following their rather bizarre rise to the pinnacle of the football world in 1998-is a truly gifted piece of cinematography.  Watch it,  or I'll make you watch cricket with the commentary.  Enjoy.",1070668800,,578,4.917525773195877

Some of the movies she showed were Jean de Florette, Manon de la Source, Le Gloire de mon Pere, and, of course, Le Huitieme Jour, which was my all-time favorite movie that she showed.  It was funny, touching, and sad all at the same time.  There is no comparison, in my opinion, to The Rain Man or Forrest Gump.  Le Huitieme Jour is in a class all to itself.",1006992000,7,483,4.274725274725275
886458,5,6304488319,"I showed this to my college students and at the end of it, there was not a single dry eye in the theatre. It taught them (and me) so much and left an indelible mark and gift for everyone. After this film, you'll never look at your life, friendship, the value of honesty or even the mentally-impaired, the same way again. This movie overturns our expectations of what constitutes normality and conformity in society. It speaks of the need for tolerance and sensitivity to others who are different from you and i. It is a beautiful tribute to the human condition, so broken and yet so full of strength and joy in times when you least expect it. I was particularly touched by the brave attempts the director goes about to portray the friendship between 2 grown men. Many directors would fight shy of this. In a society where homophobia has grown to replace the simple need for companionship, this movie makes the heroic effort to elevate this theme to a fresh and honest level. As such, there was no brawl, no beer, no macho-talk; just plain simple honesty about how 2 ordinary human beings could come together in search of their dreams. Indeed a God-inspired film to remember, for many years to come.",983923200,11,1198,4.602803738317757

It has it all, comedy, romance, drama, etc.  One of the  best parts was when Harry goes to his ex-wife's mother's house and tries to  see his daughters, I cried my eyes out in the middle of class.

886460,5,6304488319,"I just watched the most wonderful movie, and I must tell youabout it.  It's called THE EIGHTH DAY (Ale Huitieme Jour).  It's Frenchwith English subtitles.  But, don't let that stop you, if you're one of those who dislikes having to read the dialogue.  The dialogue is easy to follow, and it's mostly a visual film, and stunning at that. The cinematography is remarkable.  But, let me get back to the story, because it's important.  There are two men. -- Georges (played superbly by Pascal Duquenne), a man with Down's Syndrome, living in an institution, and missing his mother (she died).  He has recurring visions of her, along with visions of his favorite crooner singing his favorite song.  He switches gears back and forth from being erratically boisterous and playful at times, to being somber and contemplative at other times.  One day, he just walks away from the home, taking along a dog (that may or may not be his pet).  Then, there's Harry (played perfectly by Daniel Auteuil).  Harry is a salesman.  He's very good at his job, but fails in life.  He's recently divorced, and has one last chance to see his children, before his ex-wife denies him the right.  But,...  One night as he's driving in the rain,...  He hits a dog, then meets Georges.  He takes Georges (and the dog) to the police station.  But, they don't help.  Unwittingly, he becomes the guardian of Georges, but in the process of trying to take him home, they become friends.  Georges teaches Harry about the simpler pleasures in life.  And, Harry helps Georges find a home. (His mother is dead, his sister doesn't want him.)  Well... I could go on and on, but I don't want to give away the whole story.  This is not just another buddy-buddy story, or another road-trip movie.  It's more than that.  It's about friendship, family, love, life, everything. It's sad.  It's funny.  It's heart-warming.  It's everything that life is.  I laughed and cried, sometimes at the same time.  It's a truly wonderful movie.  Too bad I can only rate it five stars, it deserves ten.
