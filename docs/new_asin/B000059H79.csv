1404412,4,B000059H79,"Happy to see this great eighties  Camp-Slasher on DVD! The movie is about some Axe-swingin' Psykko named Madman Marz. Way Cooler than those crappy modern Slasher-flix like Urban Legends and Scream. Some nice Gorescenes in this one 2! PLEASE Anchor Bay, release more of those camp-flicks like ""Just Before Dawn"", ""Final Terror"", ""Memorial Day"" and the Uncut Version of "" My bloody Valentine""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",984441600,5,421,5.682539682539683
1404413,4,B000059H79,"The first time I saw Madman was on a bad quality VHS release from a South African backdoor video store. It scared me then and it still scares me now, twenty years later. This is a sound horror flick with creative art direction and cinematography.  From homage to direct creative theft, this motion picture is a best-of compilation with the most effective cinema tricks beautifully orchestrated to create a truely horrific motion picture. The down side is the ""pornographic"" acting and very weak dialogue. The characters all seem a little like clubbed seals and by the end of the flick, you are cheering the villain for putting them out of their misery. In parrallel to the cult classics, bad acting never seems to hamper a film's success or bottom line- especially in the Horror genre.  This is a DVD any self-respecting horror fan should own. I would have preferred a better remaster and possibly more special features. The sound quality is fair as is the picture. Hopefully the studio can get it together for a more impressive 25th Anniversary edition.. I'll buy both.",983577600,9,1070,4.841530054644808
1404414,4,B000059H79,"This is a great film in the fact that it tells a truely scary tale. It begins with a camp head that tells a group of camping children and their guardians a tale of a madman that once lived in the same forrest that they are now camping in. He tells them that one night a farmer went mad and killed his family with an axe, and later walked in to a bar put the bloody axe on the bar and ordered himself a drink. The people found out what happened to the family and found the farmer and hung him, So the story goes. One young camper then asked the farmers name and when it was told to him by the camp head with the following  warning ""There is a good reason that I have not told you. For if you say his name above a whisper he will find you and chop off your head."" Of course the boy yells his name and the slaughter begins once they return to the camp lodges. A good horror film that was thought out, and that I am very glad to see out on DVD. Be warned their is some very good scares but some have gore. One such seen is of a head being cut of and another of a camper loosing her head over a truck.(pun) you'll see what I mean when you veiw this truely good horror film. Why I think this is good Is as follows. Belivable acting by everyone. The film was shot totally at night which gives this film an eerie feeling. The actors and actresses could be living next door to you. In other words they look real and you can feel for their terror.  Enjoy",980726400,8,1444,3.941780821917808
1404419,2,B000059H79,"There's a lot of things about this movie I don't understand. For one, was the camp near the Marz house been there for years or was it just established recently? If the camp has been there, why did it take until now for Madman Mars to terrorize and kill all the people in charge of the place, especially since a lot of people there keep saying his name over and over again which is supposed to summon him by the way. I would get it if the camp was already new like in Friday the 13th and nobody knew they were camping next to a deranged psychopath, but if it was already there, then why did it take so long for this to happen? Was it that kid Richie's fault? Did that guy Max know that Madman Mars was real? Seriously the questions are distracting. However, I do have to give the movie credit for its suspense, clever death scenes, and a pretty scary villain, even though his animal growls are completely unnecessary. And it even ends with the possibility of a sequel (which will probably never happen). All in all Madman is an OK horror movie, not great but OK. Also the campfire theme song is awesome!",1492819200,,1102,4.302884615384615

1404426,3,B000059H79,"This is yet another '80s slasher flick with cheesy dialog, blood that looks like paint and people in their 30s and 40s posing as teenagers. While it is far from the worst horror flick I have ever seen, there isn't really anything noteworthy here.

First, the acting. These actors seem to me like New York Broadway actors trying to get their big break in film. I say so because they all have NYC accents, and they tend to sing their lines like in Broadway productions. Aside from one particular actress having a distractingly weird elfy face and a couple of guys that look like creepy child molesters, the acting is decent. The film also has too many cringy, uncomfortable sex scenes. They remind me of the John Candy sex scene in The Clown Murders for anyone who has seen that film.

The gore effects are very rubbery and the blood very painty. Obviously an extremely low-budget movie, but that is endearing in a way. They make no effort in trying to hide the fact that the killer is covered in rubber props, and they use the same rubber decapitated torso in three different scenes. Not the worst I have seen but pretty funny in it's blatant chintzyness.

Again, not a bad film. Just a very mediocre Friday the 13th clone with a little Texas Chainsaw Massacre sprinkled in. Watch if you are in the mood for a horror flick, but you have already seen everything else. If there are better movies to watch, skip this one.",1480636800,,1417,4.52734375

1404447,5,B000059H79,"True, old school American horror classic. This film combines memorable characters, a great villian brought to life by a ubiquitous campfire tale, and is absolutely loaded with enough 80's cheese to have even the most jaded horror fan grinning from ear to ear. Just check out the hot tub scene as well as ""TP's belt buckle! I couldn't recommend this film any higher and it's totally worth your time.",1468627200,,398,4.782608695652174
1404448,4,B000059H79,"I actually thought this Madman movie was not bad. I didn't realize it had as much of a cult following as it did. I hadn't seen it until I acquired Amazon Prime this year.
I don't know, and maybe I'm the only one, but I thought the hot tub scene was kind of sensual. The song was sexy too. Could be because the TP character reminded me of an old boyfriend.
Anyway, the rest of the movie was a slasher movie where you can't wait for the obnoxious, horney teens to get picked off one by one by a Madman, Jason, the guy in Halloween or Freddy Kruger, take your pick.  The difference in this film is the majority of the victims are in their twenties and don't use much more common sense than teens do in these types of movies. But I must admit there is a certain charm to Madman.  It has something, I'm not sure what it is but it was fun to watch. I might just want to watch it again.",1468108800,4,879,4.017142857142857

1404563,2,B000059H79,"As I bought and sat through this movie, naturally I remember having enjoyed it as much as Friday the 13th, the Burning, or being as decent as The Final Terror.  Unfortunately, not only is this movie not even remotely as good as I found it to be as a kid, but it doesn't even stand on its own very well enough to be genuinely entertaining either.  Furthermore, it can't even touch those other aforementioned camp slashers.  As the copy of the movie didn't entirely work, in that it pixelated and froze when it was down to its last ten minutes, luckily I found it on YouTube and finished it there.

The pace of the movie is so unbearably slow that staying awake was quite the chore.  It's near 90 minute run time was not at all necessary considering there wasn't very much going on nor was there much of a body count.  The camera work was at times too shaky, to say nothing of the first person stalker camera shots were more forced than acted upon naturally.  The acting (if you call it that) was so noticably bad and without any real attempt that the actors may as well have been given the script to read while in front of the camera.  The characters were all really stupid and annoying losers.  There just wasn't a single character that I honestly cared about in the least.  For those of you who mentioned that the cast were terribly unattractive, well I would definitely have to agree.  Could they have possibly picked a more freakishly ugly cast of people to be in this bland movie?  The score was ridiculous and sounded more like circus music.  The soundtrack is embarrassingly bad; especially the crappy theme song.  The lyrics to every song were so simple-minded beyond belief.  As for the gore, it was uneven.  Sometimes it would be well crafted and other times it just looked like they used a packet of ketchup and chewing gum.  The decapitated bodies were the best gore.  The kill scenes were just way too average for the most part. My only favorite kill scene was when one of the camp counselors is trying to fix a truck to take off and Madman Marz jumps down on the hood and decapitates her.  That proved to be both a kill that I've never seen before and also proved to be darkly funny.  Due to the movie's slow pace, the suspense was way too drawn out.  Too much time was wasted on hardly anything happening, before anyone gets killed.  Madman Marz himself was really lame.  He just looked like a big white gorilla with a bunch of scars on him.  What were they trying to do?  Were they trying to come up with a Leatherface like killer, but just didn't have any creative way to make it happen?  The scenes with the teen boy Richie running around the woods and checking out Madman Marz's old house got really tiresome after the second time.  I mean did they really have to be so redundant that they had to show more scenes of Richie running around than was really necessary?  Finally, the ending is, upsetting, inconclusive, rushed, and just plain cheesy.

A word of warning, from what I got to see of this disc, the picture quality was sometimes looking good and sometimes looking grainy.  Also there are these annoying purple lines that sometimes show in the middle of the picture.  Just thought that I would let you all know.

In closing, while this is not the worst slasher ever made, it just doesn't try very hard to amount to anything unique, mind blowing, or even all that impressive.  This movie showed little thought or imagination to it overall.  This one is better off skipped rather than even acknowledged for its total ineptitude at being entertaining.",1447286400,,3574,4.515576323987539

1404619,5,B000059H79,"An old favorite, I just had to upgrade to Blu-ray.  It is the quintessential slasher flick.  No frills, to the point, it follows the formula of many-many-many other slasher flicks.  This is the very reason I love it.  It never strays from the tried and true recipe, which requires that an unknown assailant stalks a group of seemingly defenseless dopes, and dispatches them one by one.  In this case, as in many cases, the group in question is at a camp, getting ready to close it down for the season.  They sit around a campfire and enjoy the obligatory ghost story (and a cappella song along the same vein).  As luck, or bad plotting would have it, the ghost story comes true as its main `character' Madman Marz leaves his conveniently situated house to kill the feckless counselors.

They managed to do a lot with their spare budget of a buck fifty.  First of all, they didn't hire any `real' actors (none went on to claim any measure of fame).  All they needed was some trees, a campsite, and an old house.  The FX is decent for the time period (1981).  Best of all, they had the perfect slasher blueprint to follow.  It's almost impossible to screw up an opportunity like this.  No, it's not art (high or low).  The dialog is absurd, made worse when delivered by people who can barely walk and talk at the same time, never mind emote with any amount of believability.  I love it because it's basic, raw, and ragged about the edges.  It doesn't aspire to be anything other than it is; another in a long line of similar slasher flicks.

And the score/theme are very catchy and really push the film over into iconic territory. The early 80s were filled with horror films and this is one of the best! There's a great backstory, it's beautifully shot, and I love the characters. They're all memorable. My favorite has to be Ellie, haha. She's um... very childlike. And you HAVE to see her iconic scene. Once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Acting, story, dialog and effects are about as cheap and flimsy as a kids toy in a cereal box and don't let these good reviews on here fool you. This is NOT a so bad it's good film....it's just plan bad! I can't understand why a film like this has a 3 1/2 stars out of a 5 rating on here. The movie originally flopped big time and really even didn't find a audience on home video. The audience back in 87' understood this was crap so why are people giving it good reviews today?

1404650,5,B000059H79,"Madman opens with a campfire scene where senior counsellor T.P. is telling a scary story around a campfire. After T.P. finishes trying to scare everyone, owner Max played by (Carl Fredricks) shares a gruesome and horrific tale around the campfire with the counsellors and camp children about Madman Marz. The legend of Madman Marz is about a deranged farmer who slaughtered his entire family in a farmhouse located a stones throw from where his tale is being told. The legend states that if you say his name above a whisper, Madman will return to carry out his bloody rampage. One of the campers named Richie played by (Tom Candela) blows off the tale and repeatedly shouts out the name of Madman Marz, let the blood bath begin!

I don't know where Vinegar Syndrome acquired the source material from but it seems that some serious effort was put into the new HD transfer from them before they released it on Blu-ray/DVD combo for fans to enjoy. Madman is an awesome 80s slasher that certainly doesn't disappoint and I never get tired of watching it.

The new HD transfer from Vinegar Syndrome is probably the best this film will ever look and sound unless it undergoes a complete restoration and I can't see that happening. I was really impressed with how sharp the picture looked and sounded but it still had some vertical red scratches that popped up around the 50 minute mark. The colors are pretty solid and the level of grain seems to be well managed and stable throughout the film. Overall, Vinegar Syndrome did an excellent job and Madman fans will definitely want to pick this one up for their collection. I really enjoyed the special features that were included in this release. Disc packaging and art work is well done and a reversible slip cover is included as well.

I never get tired of watching old-school horror, especially slashers from the Golden Age of Slasher Films.  MADMAN is one of those films I had heard about but never got the chance to see.  The fine folks at CAV Distributing partnered up with Vinegar Syndrome and gave the film a nice HD upgrade before releasing it on Blu-ray.  The result is an excellent film that offers an entertaining horror experience from yesteryear.

I love the tagline for the film: They thought they were alone.  It just screams ominous.  And for its time period, way back in 81, Ill bet this was a perfect draw for horror fans.

MADMAN is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The HD transfer is great and the sound quality is top notch.  I am impressed with how crisp the picture looks for the most part; there are a couple of dark scenes that project a grainy image, but I would imagine that is due to the source material.  Thankfully, they don't detract from the film at all.

The acting in MADMAN is pretty good as well. Granted, I doubt any members of the cast won any awards for their performances, but at least they weren't painful to watch.  I particularly like Paul Ehlers, who portrayed Madman Marz.  He is a towering presence onscreen, and he plays the villain with relished enthusiasm.

Theres a few gory deaths in the film, however many of them happen offscreen.  The gore we do get to see is pretty well done, but you can certainly tell it is dated.  The blood is a bit too bright and thin to be realistic, although Ill bet it looked great back in the day.

I loved MADMAN, and I highly recommend it.  Any horror fans looking for a nostalgic trek back into the early 80s will definitely want to check this out.  Its a fun romp into slasher territory, and its worth every minute of it.",1432512000,,1846,4.405325443786983

""madman"" if you think about it seems somewhat generic of a title, but don't let the title of the movie turn you away. I will say the one thing I found negative about this movie was some of the actors. By god, a couple of them were just TERRIBLE...but besides that the movie was excellent.it was directed well, it had very awesome kills, creepy scenery, cheezy sounds, and everything else that you want in a horror movie. One of the cool things here is that Madman  is more of a boogeyman rather than a psycho typed character taking revenge for something that happened to him or someone that he liked. He just sort of went crazy.

when madman is in the shot, he is not in the movie for long lengthy sessions, it is quick and he gets the job done in a quick dark cut. And you don't really get a good look at him in that many scenes...the most memorial part of this movie for me when I last saw it last, was when madman hung TP from the tree, and when TP was able to get air, madman pulled his belt buckle down. Breaking his neck.

if you are even the slightest horror fan than buy this movie! You will enjoy it as it starts almost immediately with killing! 5 out of 5",1404691200,2,1458,4.196428571428571
1404750,3,B000059H79,"Madman is not an amazing film. It's a low budget experiment in the (then immensely popular) campgrounds ""slasher"" genre. When I think of Friday the 13th, two kindred films immediately come to mind: Madman and The Burning.

Interestingly enough, even though the two films I've mentioned are at times hokey (and typically considered subpar clones of ""13th""), I actually prefer both of them to Friday the 13th. Don't get me wrong: Friday the 13th is iconic and I have a lot of respect for its love/status within the horror fan community. But it's not nearly as much FUN as Madman and the other mention.

Madman has a lot of charm and (for a lack of better word) love in its execution. It takes itself serious, but it's a bit of a mess. I love this about the film. If you appreciate camp and charisma, then you'll most likely get some entertainment value out of this little low key movie. If you are expecting massive scares and Criterion or Oscar level acting, then go elsewhere. Madman is what it is: a cheesy 80's horror ditty that has a few creepy moments, gore, teenagers making out (though most of the actors appear to be in their 30's in actuality), and urban legend fun.",1385942400,3,1174,4.559241706161138

I was excited to get this when I did, but I found out there are much better horror/slasher films out there from this time era. I do like the movie however, it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. That horrible music soundtrack and jingle drove me crazy. If it wouldn't have been for that, I would have found this movie much more enjoyable. The music soundtrack sounds very corny, and very outdated, even for that time. This movie was made in 1982, but it has a very late 70's feel to the whole thing. The kills are pretty good, and it kept me entertained nonetheless. The acting wasn't the greatest either. The translation to DVD was really good. This is a good movie to watch and have for your collection, but don't expect anything really great. If you can get this at a good price, I would recommend it.

Overall the FX is pretty good too. The DVD itself I'm told is out of print and I believe it since I spent $20+ on this DVD but I think its way worth your money. The quality of the DVD isn't too bad but there are some points in the movie you can tell that it's bad and old but it's still a very good transfer. This is the best you are ever gonna get for this movie and I'm quite pleased with it. Buy it.,1371081600,6,766,3.7639751552795033
1404753,4,B000059H79,"MADMAN opens w/ someone singing a spooky song, followed by the gruesome story of the vengeful MADMAN MARZ being told around a campfire. We are introduced to the camp counselors, on the last night of summer camp. They barely have time to return to their cabins, before the bloodbath begins. One of their number is slashed and hacked to death by the world's tallest, ugliest farmer. You guessed it, MADMAN MARZ is back in business! Uh-oh, two horny counselors have decided to get naked in the camp hot tub! Don't they know that those things are just full of icky bacteria? Once their clothes are back on, the true horror begins. They should have stayed in the tub! Soon, lover-boy finds himself on the wrong end of a noose! Another couple decides to camp out... In a tent! Hello! A 400 lb. maniac is on the loose. This is NOT the time to be sleeping under a thin piece of canvas! Meanwhile, another genius goes out looking for those who are missing... Alone! Hey, Einstein... Oh, never mind.

1404756,3,B000059H79,"I went into this expecting better. I thought this was going to be a very exciting, unique slasher but it turns out it was little more than another Friday the 13th.

Madman takes place at a camp, complete with kids, teenage camp counselors, and the old guy who's supposed to be making sure the teenagers are watching the kids and not having sex with one another all of the time. The old guy's name is Max (Carl Fredericks) and we start out listening to one of his ""campside stories."" The story he spins for everybody is that of Madman Marz. A number of years ago, Max tells us, a farmer butchered his entire family and then went to the tavern for a beer. Although the town hanged him for his crimes, Marz escaped into the woods and was never heard from again. Max warns his camp not to say the name Madman Marz above a whisper or else they'll piss Marz off and he'll come to get them. At this point, your classic punk stands up and starts mocking the whole story, screaming out ""Madman Marz."" This is where the story really begins.

The gory scenes in this movie are quite good but Marz is to weird and clunky and comes off a lot like Victor Crowley from the Hatchet movies. All in all, this film is okay. Their are certainly worse slasher movies, but there are better ones also.",1358121600,3,1278,4.320833333333334

Boring, contrived, not in the least scary, with terrible acting, laughable music (especially in the weird ""love"" scene in the hot tub, that includes a lot of spinning around, for some reason)and with actors and actresses that are so hideously ugly I could not believe it.  Now, I'm gay so I usually don't care about these things, but these people were disctractingly ugly with horrible hairdos and makeup.  The killer in this is not scary in the slightest, the woods ended up being brightly lit and all of the people are so stupid, they lose sympathy right away.

Madman, in my opinion, is one of those great campy movies that slipped through the cracks because it didn't have the advertising budget of the 80's slasher sequels. I love the look and overall feel of this movie. I won't even get into the purists' argument about the color being different and the restoration not ""holding to the original look"". This thing ain't up for any academy awards, it's just a good flick for a bowl of popcorn on the couch and getting your creep-out on. The backstory of Madman Marrs is pretty cool and the older gent telling the tale around the campfire delivers it perfectly. If there's one thing I think is a useless waste of film in the movie, it's that stupid hot tub scene. Almost torturous to watch. Fast forward is your friend there. I do love Madman's killing skills, and the old car-hood beheading is still pretty awesome for us gorehounds. The special features are actually pretty cool too. You get a ""where are they now"" update of the actors and stories and remembrances from those who participated. In addition, the old filming location is revisited. Best of all, you get to know the Madman himself. I still have my VHS copy of this movie, but I was tired of replacing drive bands on my VCR.

1404761,5,B000059H79,"With this being the second year of my ""31 Reviews For 31 Days of Halloween"" list for the month of October, I figured I'd kick it off with an old-school film, an underrated gem in the slasher sub-genre known as Madman. With the explosion of slasher films and their sequels coming from the late '70s through the '80s, it's easy to see how some might have gotten forgotten (classics such as The Burning, The Prowler, and this film!). However, ""Madman"" has what it takes to stand with the best of them from the Golden Era of Horror.
This movie comes with the full package: A cast of likable characters that are portrayed by good actors, a creepy supernatural element set in a desolate environment and naturally some excellent gore scenes. For a very worthy addition to anybody's library of fun, entertaining and bloodsoaked slasher-film classics, ""Madman"" should prove a good view!

1404762,4,B000059H79,"I'm not going to bother with describing the plot because most other reviews have, but in my own personal opinion I really enjoyed this movie. A lot of people I know would watch 10 minutes of this movie and then take it out of their dvd player, but that's because they're comparing these movies to the hostel's and saw's of today, when really there is no comparison. You need the right mind in order to know how to approach these films, you have to think that this film was done in the early 80's, in a time where the gory slashers were just getting warmed up to the public. Instead of crying over a picture that isn't in HD and was obviously shot 30 years ago, you have to think back to the 80's before everyone was de-sensitized to death with the silly gorefests of today. With that all in mind, this is a really enjoyable slasher. Acting was sub-par but I wasn't expecting any De Niro's in Madman. The suspense was there, the gore was there, the campy theme was there, everything a slasher fan would want in feeling nostalgic. Friday the 13th and Halloween were both better films in my opinion but this is a solid little entry in the decade of the slasher.",1306627200,4,1158,4.3657407407407405

1404764,2,B000059H79,"Madman is a diamond in the rough for 80's slasher films.  I first heard about this movie from the boys over at Deadpit.com and quickly added it to my ""Horror movies I need to watch"" list.  Let me tell you, I wasn't disapointed one bit.  It had everything I wanted in my 80's slasher film.  Cheesy dialogue, over the top gore, cheesy acting and a great monster/killer.  In my humble oppion, this movie and its character could have been a franchise like Halloween or Friday the 13th.  Long live Madman Marz.  After viewing this little treasure, I went on Amazon.com to purchase it.  Low and behold it was out of print and out of my price range.

Then Code Red came along and not only were they going to rerelease it, but they were going to add a bunch of bells and whistles to it.  I was excited and couldn't wait to get my hands on this new release.  Well I finally received it the other day in the mail and boy was it a let down.

Don't get me wrong, the extras are fantastic, especially for all you Madman fans out there.  It was the picture quality that is dissapointing.  It says that it was taken from a HD transfer.  Oh yeah, from what a HD VHS transfer?  In the dark scenes when characters move or walk across the screen there are ""ghost images"".  Its like the movie was shown on a movie screen and someone had a video camera in the audience and filmed it.  I've been told that the ""ghost image"" is caused when the original source material was interlaced and then transfered and watched on progressive scan players.  Even the colors seemed brighter and more orange than I remembered when I watched it for the first time.  Also, there are several scenes where there are lines or ""claw marks"" on the screen.  Its like I said earlier, it looks like someone bootleged this from a theater showing and there were 4 to 5 tears in the movie screen it was shown on.

One final thought.  This disc is worth it, if for anything else, the extra features.  For my money, I'd invest in a copy of the first release put out by Anchor Bay.  I know I will.",1302480000,2,2044,4.287958115183246

This was almost like Friday the 13th in which there was gore but alot of it was cut away. Im not an expert on this movie so I don't know if they had to cut the gore due to censors.

Overall, a decent little 80's horror flick. Its nothing new but id was enjoyable. I thought it could have been done a little better. The picture was remastered but still had alot of cracks and pops. The speical features are pretty unique and worth checking out.",1297900800,,706,4.115942028985507
1404770,4,B000059H79,"Over the years I've seen Madman gain momentum and become a much more popular horror film.  Not within the mainstream of course(Madman isn't a household name by any means), but in the horror community.  Thanks to DVD and the internet.  I remember reading about this movie in a horror film review guide in my early teens, and it took a few years until I finally came across a used VHS copy(as a cult/horror film fan, the only thing I miss about the old VHS days is the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of finally getting my hands on something ""special"").  I wasn't blown away, but I enjoyed the movie, and now I have found as the years pass that I like it more with each viewing.
Being part of the early 80s slasher boom, it's dismissed by critics and moviegoers as just another violent Friday the 13th clone.  Though Madman and it's brethren owe their existence to Friday the 13th, most slasher films do indeed have their own styles and personalities.  Madman, though it follows the typical slasher film slice-and-dice dynamic, has it's own unique touches and it's own character to seperate itself from the pack.  Like FT13TH, it takes place at a summer camp, but where FT13TH's mayhem was before the camp's opening, Madman's is on the final night.  The spooky campfire tale of Madman Marz and his legendary massacre soon become reality for the campers and counselors as the legend himself makes an appearance(thanks to an arrogant kid disobeying the Madman Marz rule of not speaking his name out loud).  So with axe in hand, Marz takes out everyone in his path and stores their bodies in his farmhouse.  Only Gaylen Ross seems to have the guts to stand up to the guy.  One of the cool things here is that Madman Marz is more of a boogeyman rather than a psycho taking bloody revenge for some tragedy from years before.  Though it never comes out and truly explains, we get the notion that Marz is in some sense supernatural, yet flesh and blood.  The scenes showing Marz are very well done.  He's shown in quick, shadowy cuts.  Whether he's running through the woods or peering in windows, we get a good idea of what he looks like without the camera showing us too much of him, yet at the same time showing him frequently.  This way he's never boring and never seems to wear out his welcome.  One of the creepiest shots in the film(or in any slasher film for that matter), is a silhouetted shot of him in a tree, spying down on the campfire, with one of the campers noticing him.  Pretty cool(but it certainly doesn't make sense why this one kid would see this, say nothing to anyone, break from the rest of the group and wander off to explore the Madman Marz farmhouse alone!).
It's really a well done and fun slasher film that thankfully is getting some recognition now(unfortunately after the director's death).
Code Red has given us a documentary on this anniversary edition, and the sucker is almost an hour and a half long!  It covers a lot of bases and talks to cast members and numerous fans.  Unfortunately it also informs us of a......you guessed it-Madman remake in.......you guessed it-3D!!  Though this remake will be done by folks involved in the original film, it's still not very good news...to me anyway.  I mean, am I the only one who thinks this whole remake and 3-D fad is the tackiest thing in film history??  But that's a rant for another time.
We also get a bonus feature that shows us music inspired by Madman.  This ranges from variations on the Madman theme song to S.O.D-like tributes and such.  Not bad, but not essential either.  The documentary is the real gem and worth the moola to buy this one.  I haven't listened to the commentary yet, but I'm sure that'll be interesting as well.
It's strange because years ago I thought I was hot poop for having that cruddy VHS tape, and I never thought it'd get better than that.  Never thought of DVD, let alone an ""anniversary"" DVD.

It dosent have much gore and no female nudity which was a must for slasher films back then but it works for this movie. Madman himself was a pretty good vilian although why he is the way he is never explained. The story in the opening was a bit creepy and set the mood for this unsung slasher classic.

1404776,3,B000059H79,"From the late 70's through the early 80's, it was the golden era of the slasher horror film. During this period, many played on the old standby of a killer in the woods theme (""The Prowler"", ""Don't Go In The Woods"", ""The Burning"" and, of course, ""Friday the 13th""). By 1982, this had become ""old hat."" Yet, late in the game, here comes ""Madman""! The basic plot is what you would expect: Some camp counselors wind up as the targets of a legendary kill-crazy farmer, appropriately named, Madman Marz. It is a completely predictable and by-the-numbers slasher formula.

The acting is, as is usually the case in most low-budget slashers, almost non-existent. Save for the character of Betsy (played by Gaylen Ross, under the name ""Alexis Dubin,"" as I guess she didn't want it to be known she was in a cheesy slasher flick), none of the characters gets developed enough to the point you know or care about any of them. The killer isn't really developed any, either, as he is portrayed as the typical ""super-human"" maniac, showing incredible physical strength and speed, beyond any mere mortal. It's said he murdered his family, but you never really learn why, as the script is more interested in setting up hokey hot-tub scenes, in an effort to provide the prerequisite nudity in such films. Everything just plods along in a very predictable manner.

So, what you are left with is the special effects and atmosphere to provide you any real entertainment. Fortunately, it actually does. One of the things I really liked about the setting, is how well they played up how easy it is to get lost in the woods at night. The sameness of the surroundings actually helped convey a sense of tension in not knowing exactly where you are. And since this is a time before the advent of cell phones, it comes off somewhat realistically. Of course, some of that is undone by a soundtrack which, at times, sounds like someone who got their hands on a Kasio keyboard and suddenly thought they were John Carpenter.

As for the killings themselves, it's a mixed bag that ranges from the extremely gruesome to the extremely phony! Although, some of the kills are pretty inventive, like the one where the girl is beheaded by the hood of the car she is trying to get working. I also like that they tried to keep the killer more to the shadows for most of the film. Something that might have been more out of necessity, than to illicit a sense of mystery, as when you get a good look at the killer the cheapness of the effects shows how much they lacked a budget here.

In the end, the film is merely a typical example of the schlocky early 80's slasher formula. It could be entertaining for those who are fans of the genre, or those who love to mock it. Otherwise, you can probably pass on it. It's simply another unoriginal slasher film, that looks extremely cheap and has not aged very well. Might make for a good Halloween party film, though, as it comes off as the technological equivalent of telling a ghost story around a campfire.",1273104000,,3011,4.591078066914498

If in the woods I run into anything that even looks close to what Madman Marz  looks like, I'd crap my pants haha.  I don't consider this a knock-off to any slasher flick; the creators behind this flick just might of had some inspiration from more respected slashers, and the fact that slasher flicks were turning into such a big craze in a time were it was easy to make a quick buck haha.  But seriously, the way these guys put this movie together with little money and with such style is amazing to me.  I LOVE the blue lighting that cascades throughout the film.  This is going to sound cheesy of me, but this is such a beautiful film for being a low-budget flick about killer in the woods haha.  I love the way Marz moans and groans when wondering about, also, the way they made him seem so monstrous when up close to his next victim!  Oh, and the kills are great!

1404779,2,B000059H79,"Not even sure where to begin with this one. ""Madman"" is yet another
early 80's ""slasher"" film set in the woods and yes, there's a legend of a ""crazed killer"" [sound familiar] who is ready to slice & dice if you
call out his name above a whisper.

Yes,the premise is that ridiculous and as the movie progresses the story does not improve. First and foremost, let's start with the ""acting""!?!
BAD...we're talking, HORRIFICALLY bad. Some reviewers here at amazon suggest that ""bad acting"" works in these type of films...that's true...to an extent. This is not one of them. It's pretty obvious that no one [director especially] was watching the dailies.

Beyond the thespian-ism, ""The Music"" is goofy or dull, that is, when they decide to add music to a potentially frightening scene....one of many missed opportunities in this mess of a movie.

As for ""Mr. Madman Marz"" himself...he looks like Santa Claus with a fierce hangover and a grumpy attitude. Incidentally, the ""grunts"" that  emanate from ""Mr Marz"" added only comedy to his actions, not menace.

Moreover, all the other ""slasher requisites"" are in short supply here...gore/blood, nudity, sex, suspense...not even a good final chase scene. At best, there are two good killings and maybe one ""jump scare""

However, there are moments when ""Madman"" is so bad that it begins to get surreal. Cue, ""Hot-Tub"" scene, so absurd, ""swirling"" around the hot tub...looks like a late 70's commercial for real bad wine or cologne. Also, one of the faux chase scenes is absolutely mind-blowing. I was in disbelief watching a twentyish something year old woman run slower than my grandmother on crutches whilst a crazed, axe-wielding, santa-hillbilly monster was after her.

Just for the record, I love horror, especially late 70's/early 80's slasher films... so I'm not criticizing this film because I can't relate to genre, low budgets etc etc...

Anyway, if you like ""80's slasher/horror movies""..I suppose this is worth one look...if you plan on purchasing...PLEASE do not pay a lot of money for this train wreck. I own this disaster and thankfully I can't remember what I paid for it...probably too much, sadly.

Remember, there are far better ""Slasher n Stalker"" guilty pleasures out there....from ""Friday the 13th"", ""The Burning"" [Madman ""borrows"" from both these films...no-where near their equal, ,obviously] ""The Prowler"", ""He knows You're Alone"" to name a few + if you want more ""wood/cabin/counselors"" slashers...watch ""Sleepaway Camp""

I'm giving ""Madman"" [for unintentional comedy than anything]

Take an hour and a half and go for a real walk in the woods.  It would be more entertaining than this tripe.",1227571200,4,880,4.645161290322581
1404782,4,B000059H79,"Released in 1982 Madman was released at a time when the slasher film was all the rage, but even by 1982 these movies were starting to get a bit stale as the previous year 1981 saw the release of such movies as Friday the 13th Part II, The Burning, My Bloody Valentine and The Prowler. Due to the fact slasher movies aren't the most original all these movies start to become the same thing as past movies and again while still early into the slasher flick by 1982 things were getting stale.

But despite that Madman is one of the better of the 80s slasher flicks; the budget is quite low, but fairly well made at least by slasher movie standards and the gore is pretty decent and Madman actually has some pretty cool kill scenes. Despite the flaws of Madman I do think it's one of the better of the 80s slasher flicks and has a pretty good visual look and solid use of locations with some decent acting. Some are better than others, but overall the acting while yes weak overall is better than most films its kind.

The screenplay by Joe Giannone is surprisingly decent; most slasher flicks have some rather weak scripts, but that doesn't really matter since I doubt anyone goes into these movies expecting a well written movie. But Joe Giannone's screenplay isn't bad at all. The characters are weak again this is a slasher movie after all, but they aren't too bad. You'll probably be hard pressed to remember many of their names and you probably won't be sad to see them go, but the characters aren't too bad.

The concept is sort of like Friday the 13th Part II and The Burning, both those movies deal with an urban legend of sorts on their villains and Madman has the same idea with the legend of Madman Marz played by Paul Ehlers. Though this movie was released a year after Friday the 13th Part II and The Burning from what I've heard this was actually shot at the same time. All 3 movies were shot near each other so I suppose the makers could have gotten some ideas from those two, but odds are it's just a coincidence.

Besides writing, Joe Giannone also directs and delivers a mostly well made movie with some good pacing. The suspense and tension are mostly lacking, but what is lacks in those areas it does make up for in just being a fun flick that runs at a good pace. There are some slight pacing problems the biggest flaw is the very out of place love scene with some really lame music playing. Besides that though, Madman is well made and delivers on just being fun.

The gore is fairly decent, but don't expect a bloodbath, but what gore there is I thought was mostly good despite the low budget. The kill scenes are good with one decapitation by hood of a car. That was possibly the most memorable scene of the movie. It's not everyday you see a movie with a decapitation from a car hood.

My favorite scene though comes towards the end when one girl hides in a refrigerator; of all the slasher flicks and horror flicks for that matter I don't believe I've ever seen anything like that before. And how Madman Marz wasn't aware she was hiding in there is beyond me, but hey it's a slasher flick so I'll cut it some slack and the scene was really funny as well.

Overall Madman was quite enjoyable and like I said in my opinion one of the better slasher flicks from the 80s. While the suspense and tension might lack the movie works due to the fun level. There's also a nice twist with the final girl played by Alexis Dubin best known from George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. It's something most of these movies shy away from and it's good to see the formula shaken up a bit.

This movie is more of a 3-star review or maybe 3 1/2, but I decided to give it the 4 due to it being simply a fun movie. Madman is only for fans of 80s slasher flicks, the rest best to avoid.",1222905600,2,3782,4.316901408450704

1404784,1,B000059H79,"Madman (Joe Giannone, 1982)

Joe Giannone, who had made a name for himself as the second unit director for the unbelievably awful (and yet somehow still brilliant) Parts: The Clonus Horror, stepped out on his own for Madman, his directorial debut. As I write this, twenty-six years later, it remains the only film Giannone has either written or directed. And my oh my, there's a good reason for that. In a time when cinemas were swamped with terrible slasher films, it's possible Madman was the worst of the entire lot. I mean, how do you manage to screw up the easiest plot in the entire universe?

Plot: Killer. Camp. Counselors. Kids. Yeah, it's that simple. And yet the details make absolutely no sense. It's hard to give examples without spoilers, but you'll know them when you see them. (The best reason to watch this movie is to pay attention to the small details, so you can find all the places where the film is made of more hole than plot.)

I watched this simply because it's the last Gaylen Ross film (she only made three, and I've seen the other two dozens of times each). And, to be honest, to see one of the few times the wonderful Gaylen Ross was actually in front of a camera is the only reason to  watch this turkey. The acting is terrible, the direction is terrible, the script is terrible, the special effects are terrible, the lighting is terrible, if there's an aspect of filmmaking you can think of, it's terrible. I'm trying to remember a worse movie I've seen this year, and offhand, I can't think of one. (zero)",1205107200,3,1537,4.537906137184115

That's just an element  that lends to some of it's retro charm. I'm so glad it's getting this Blu Ray release and can't wait to buy it.

The death scenes are fun and the effects are good .I especially like when at the campfire the older guy talks about the legend of Madman Marz  and as he tells it, it's reinacted. The score is one of my favorites and it has all the wonderful cliches and formulaic action we have come to love and expect in our eighties Slashers.

1404790,3,B000059H79,"A local farmer who killed his entire family was hanged and left for dead by the local town's people. Noone knew what happened to 'Madman' Marz because when they went back to the hanging site, he was gone. The legend of Madman Marz grew and everyone said if you speak his name, you must do it at a whisper, because it Madman Marz hears you he will come and kill you.
It's the last night of Summer camp and the remaining counselors and kids are gathered around the fire. They tell the story of Madman Marz, when one of the campers think it's fun and games when he starts screaming his name. The head counselor heads out for a night on the town (alot like the counselors in Friday The 13th Part 2) and leaves the rest to fend for themselves. That is when their nightmare starts. Madman Marz comes to slaughter the entire camp.
Madman Marz won't stop until they are all dead.

The setting of this film was really dark, alot like Friday The 13th. I really dug that alot. The camp itself looked alot like the original Camp Crystal Lake in friday The 13th. (Most of)The kills were very unique, brutal and bloody. The killer in a way moved and reminded me of Steve Dash's Jason in Friday The 13th Part 2, which may of been coincidental, but by the time Friday 2 was shot and released this was just beginning to shoot.
The movie takes place in the night, in a span of a few hours. I think the darkness added alot to the movie, but it also seemed to be very fast paced.

First off, we have seen that 'campfire scene' where the local legend is told. That was not needed at all. The actors (forgive me for saying this) were all ugly (with the exception of Gaylen Ross) and fairly annoying. Some of the kills were really cheesy with cheesy/lame sound effects. The acting was not so bad, but it lacked in critical parts. The killer was also a bit cheesy and a bit super-human. Although, when his super-human strength was needed he failed to use it to open a bus door, C'mon!

Another Summer camp great. A good flick in it's own rite. It was supposed to be based on the same legend 'The Burning' was based on, but when it was revealed that (at the same time The Burning was being shot), that there was another movie with the same plot, it was then changed. But that is about where the similarities between the two movies end. I am still really sore that they killed off Gaylen Ross, it appeared that they did it just to add one more bloody kill, and it was. I think she would have made a great heroine for this movie. The ending also left me a bit let down.",1136246400,3,2542,4.25879917184265
1404791,3,B000059H79,"In many ways, the ur-slasher movie was John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", released in 1978 to become the biggest grossing independent movie in history to that date.  ""Halloween"" is a classic, with a strong plot and great characters, and a movie that does not depend on raw gore to hold the audience's interest.  Essentially, ""Halloween"" is a well-made movie that happens to include some blood.

Two years later, in 1980, the makers of ""Friday the 13th"" decided that audiences, particularly teen audiences, wanted to see blood and breasts, and made a movie that stripped out such surplusage as plot and character.  ""Friday the 13th"" also debuted the ""spam in a cabin"" genre that became so popular in the 80s.

Two years after that, ""Madman"" appeared on the scene.  In many ways, ""Madman"" is simply a derivative take on ""Friday the 13th"", as an early spam-in-a-cabin knockoff.  Some gifted kids are out at a campfire at a retreat.  In November.  And it's obvious they've been there forever.  Huh.  Usually kids are in school in early November.  The retreat features a ratio of staff to kids of over 1:1, which isn't hard when there are 5 kids.  Seriously, there are just 5 kids at this retreat.  How it stays in business is one of the mysteries of the ages.  The inexplicably-British guy in charge tells an overly-Shakespearian story about a bad man named Madman Marz who just so happened to live in an abandoned house a literal stone's throw from the campfire.  He killed his family in a fit of pique or something years ago, so he got strung up by the townsmen.  If you say his name, he shows up and commences to killin'.  So, of course one of the counselors challenges ol' Madman Marz to come out, and throws a rock at the abandoned house, smashing a window.  Nice example.  Of course, Madman Marz somehow survived the whole hanging business, and comes after the counselors one by one.  As my wife points out, you get super monster powers by being evil and being hanged by the locals how?  But you just have to roll with it.

""Madman"" is clearly derivative and unoriginal.  However, it still retains the creepiness of some of the early slasher films, by treating its material straight.  And the characters, while not drawn with great precision, avoid falling into the later stereotypes (Fat Guy!  Dumb Guy!  Slut!  Smart Chick!  Preppie!) that bedeviled these movies.  In addition, ""Madman"" doesn't exploit the tired sex = death cliche of the slasher genre.  All of the ladies of Madman like to get busy, but Marz does not single any of them out for punishment as a result.

Whatever the merits of ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" when that movie came along, it introduced the wisecracking killer and slapped a jokey facade on the entire horror genre, a facade that only now is starting to crack.  It could be argued that by the time of ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" the slasher genre had already become such a self-parody that it could only be played for laughs.  Still, the jokey slasher movie removed even the pretense of horror from these films.  ""Madman"" occupies a position on the great slasher timeline when these pictures started to become derivative of one another, but before the horror was eschewed entirely in favor of fancy effects and jokes.  It's at least worth a rent if you like horror/slasher movies.",1130284800,4,3304,4.745166959578207
1404792,3,B000059H79,"Ah yes, the early 1980's were a glorious time for cheesy unoriginal horror films that seemed to come out every other week, looking to cash in on the huge success of ""Friday The 13th""

Enter ""Madman"". This is a must see for fans of late 70's and early 80's slasher flicks! It's got that lost in the woods camera work that's absent in so many of today's horror movies.

Considered by some to be an unsung slasher classic, Madman Marz follows six counselors at a summer camp for gifted children. After hearing the legend of Madman Marz, the local maniac who slaughtered his family, who will supposedly appear if someone calls his name loudly enough. A young camper, indeed decides to tempt fate by yelling his name. Soon afterward the counselors, one by one, become victim to the Madman!

""Madman"" has all the elements of the great early 80's cheese that fans of the genre appreciate. The awful acting, dated clothing and cheesy special effects that is expected from a movie made in 1982. Not an awful movie but one you'll most likely forget afterwards. Worth an evening for the avid early 80's slasher filck fans.

Now was that to hard of a plot to think up, then the movie runs just like Friday the 13th.

The acting is not bad, the murders are not bad either overall its a decent movie and better than I expected, but what you are getting is a low budget  ""Friday the 13th"", thats all same plot in many ways.

Basically a dis-figured man living in the woods chopping up teens that come out to the stixs for a summer vacation, no need to say more.

Although some of the death scenes aren't too shabby, the effects aren't really good enough to make it believable - Which inadvertantly makes the majority of the movie a ""so cheesy it's funny"" kind of affair.

(The Plot)
A group of children and camp workers sit around a campfire telling scary stories into the night. One tells of Madman Marz, a farmer who drank too much and beat his wife. One night Marz hacked his and family to death. So legend has it that it you say his name above a whisper, he'll come after you...
(The Movie)
This is one of the better early 80's slashers that quickly followed Friday the 13th. The movie starts of quite quickly, getting right into the story about Madman Marz, they show some flashbacks of him killing his family with an axe and such. Once the secret of not saying Madman Marz's name out loud was given to everyone else at the campfire, the stupid teenager just couldn't resist in yelling it out and even throwing a bottle through a window into Marz's house.
When the teen notices a gigantic man looking at him from a tree, that's when the fear set in. I'm sure a lot of people who have seen this movie got a little freaked out right away as Marz slowly makes his way down the tree. That is one scene that I will never forget from this movie. It doesn't take too long for Marz to make his first kill as you don't really get to see much of his face until the last half of the movie. Marz looks like a really old man who was never told about a little thing called ""haircut"" (...).
This is still your normal, average slasher movie that doesn't really do much different from the others, though some of the camera angles used in this movie are sweeter than sugar. If you're a slasher fan, it's a must see but I'd still even recommend it to anyone looking for a scare or perhaps... a laugh?
(The DVD)
This is a really old, low-budget film which can be excused for not having perfect picture and sound quality. Picture can sometimes seem really good though half the time it does get a little hazy in certain scenes and the audio seemed quite dull most of the time. An example of the audio would be like hearing a new movie which had something (i.e. a blanket) covering the speakers, muffling the sound.
The extras are few but more than what anyone should expect from a film like this. You get an audio commentary track which I have only partially listened to though it seemed interesting enough (normally, I only listen to audio commentary on movies that I really love), quite a few TV Spots and the theatrical trailer.",1086912000,,2349,4.365296803652968

About 10 years ago I found a copy for sale in a mom & pop video store in the neighborhood and picked it up. Now here I was in my mid 20's, newly married and decided to put this in one night when my wife was out of town. Damn if Madman still didn't pack a punch that had me holding onto my dachshund for some comfort. Then flash forward 10 years later, here I am in my mid 30's , well past the demo for this kind of flick, and I get the DVD. I watch the DVD, again alone in the dark, and damn if it still doesn't get under my skin and creep me out. What is so goofy here is that I love horror films. I have seen all of the 80's slasher movies scores of times, I enjoy all of the latest and greatest scream-fests Hollywood can pound out, but there is just something about Madman that stands out. I don't know if it's the cheap production, or the bad acting, or the synth soundtrack, but somehow it really strikes a chord that produces genuine fright with me. I see by other reveiws here that I am in the minority with Madman, but I would recommend this movie very highly! This thing has scared me for three decades. Maybe you just need to watch Madman alone in the dark for it's power to work, but whatever it is just make sure that when you do watch it, that someone is in the house you can talk to afterward, or get a dachshund to try and ward off the willies!!",1086220800,2,1524,3.9836601307189543

So recently I bought the DVD from Amazon hoping to have a 3rd great time.  I talked my wife into watching it with me, assuring her it was scary and fun.  10 minutes into the film I was embarrassed that my memory was so tainted.  maybe it was because I was sober.
Now this is not a review aiming to trash the film. I DO like it.  Just want to point to the film's focus group.  This movie is so cheesy it should be sponsored by the state of Wisconsin.  From the opening credits displayed on a red graphic painted in someone's craft class accompanied by a hokey synthesizer score, you will know exactly what you are in for.
This film IS scary.  The crazy madman is spooky, the woods are dark and offer many hiding places for nasty beasties, and the murders are very convincing.  The acting is HORRIBLE though and the dialogue is so cheesy the actors can't do anything without a fondue pot.
So, will you enjoy this movie?  Yes, yes you will IF you are kicking back, relaxed and willing to just go with it and stay with it for the very worthy payoffs the movie offers.  This is NOT the movie, however, that you want to use to convert a non-fan of the genre.

1404811,3,B000059H79,"Okay, 1982's MADMAN is admittedly low-budget schlock. That's a given.  But does MADMAN qualify as schlock in the Ed Wood vein (i.e., so bad that it's actually fun)?  Or is it just another run-of-the-mill '80s slasher flick whose creators wanted to hitch a quick ride on the lucrative HALLOWEEN (1978) and FRIDAY THE 13th (1980) gravy train?  Well, that's actually hard to say, because MADMAN not only precariously walks the fine line between an enjoyable cult flick and unwatchable celluloid, it inexorably teeters back and forth to either side of that line during its entire 88-minute runtime.  But again, is MADMAN so bad that it's actually good? Well, yes...and no.
There are aspects of MADMAN that aficionados of cheesy horror will certainly love.  The synthesizer-based musical score envelopes the film in a cheesy but charming 1980s skin, with the catchy ditty played during both the opening and closing credits being especially droll. And the campfire tale of the murderous Madman Marz, told in the opening scene, is pretty spooky and functions as a fun set-up for the flick's plot.  The film's setting is a wooded campground during the late autumn, and James Lemmo's excellent night-for-night cinematography gives the film a perfect Halloween-ish (the holiday, not the movie) texture.  Also, some of the requisite killings are carried out in amusingly original ways--the decapitation via truck hood is a must-see for hardcore fans--with more men than women comprising the final body count (a slasher-flick rarity).
On the other hand, a lot of the acting in MADMAN is more monstrous than the eponymous killer, though to be fair, a lack of thespian talent is not necessarily a bad thing for a lovable trash pic.  Whether this works to the film's advantage or not is debatable, but be forewarned that some of the performances here are, to put it bluntly, appalling.  Several lines are delivered with improper inflection or with a palpable lack of appropriate emotion, and when lack of acting ability isn't the problem, some of the scripted dialogue is so insipid and unrealistic that even the best of actors would have trouble delivering it in a believable or natural manner.  One notable exception is the performance of Gaylen Ross, here credited as Alexis Dubin.  (Genre fans will recognize her from 1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD and 1982's CREEPSHOW.)  As camp counselor Betsy, Ms. Ross exudes enough genuine pathos, even when spewing ludicrous lines, that hers is the one character the audience hopes will avoid a fatal encounter with the killer.
Ever since sexy P.J. Soles flashed her mammary glands in HALLOWEEN, slasher-film fans expect to see a certain amount of nudity.  Alas, MADMAN hardly delivers here.  Yes, there is a hot-tub scene where viewers get a light-speed flash of Gaylen Ross' bare chest, but to the dismay of male viewers--who make up the larger percentage of the slasher-flick audience--it is accompanied by a longer flash of a guy's naked behind!  Not a good thing.
And finally, the make-up for the titular killer himself, Madman Marz, is a bit hokey.  When the audience at last gets a good view of him, he looks more like a hillbilly version of ol' Saint Nick than an ol' serial killer.  Director Giannone wisely keeps the old gent in the shadows for most of the movie, though, showing him only in quick glimpses or, better yet, in silhouette against the night sky.  Pretty spooky, that.  But again, the actual revelation is a letdown.
Alone, MADMAN deserves a middle-of-the-road rating of 2.5 stars (if amazon.com allowed for partial stars, that is).  But Anchor Bay's very cool DVD packaging raises the film's rating to 3 stars.  In addition to the theatrical trailer, the DVD includes several TV spots, as well as--believe it or not--a cool feature commentary with some of the crew and actors!  On top of that, the disc's menu system is a ""killer""!  The cursor is a little bloody axe, and as it is moved from option to option, the blood disappears in transit but reappears when the cursor ""whacks"" into the top of that option!  Also, when an option other than ""Play"" is selected, a much larger bloody axe swoops across the entire screen as, in its wake, the current menu imagery is replaced with new sub-menu imagery.  Very clever and very cool.
Recap: MADMAN does lean towards the Wood-esque enough to provide a few laughs, and it also provides some genuinely eerie moments and a few imaginative killings.  Hardcore slasher-flick fans will probably love MADMAN, and even casual fans of this sub-genre may want to watch it due to its historical significance as one of the first HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th rip-offs.  As for mainstream horror fans, it's really hard to say.  MADMAN walks that fine line that divides enjoyable trash pics from the unwatchable, and it vacillates so much that personal preference will depend on just how low one's willing to go.  The DVD package from Anchor Bay is so cool (and so affordable), though, that it alone justifies adding this film to any serious horror collection.",1074729600,4,5036,4.9336492890995265
1404812,2,B000059H79,"""Madman"" attempted to cash in on the success of ""Friday the 13th"" and John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Unfortunately for the producers of this movie, every other guy in Hollywood with a few dollars decided to cash in at roughly the same time. Thus the late 1970s and early 1980s are rife with cheap slasher films sporting a crop of youngsters and a maniac on the rampage. You have ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""Graduation Day,"" ""April Fool's Day,"" and a dozen other similarly themed films. With the advent of DVD, these movies are starting to make a comeback. In a few cases, the rerelease of some of these cheesy slasher films is a good thing. For the most part, however, the films look little better now than they did back then. Occasionally, one of the DVD companies will through a few extras on the disc or punch up the sound to 5.1, but this is usually a rarity. Sadly, many companies continue to release these slasher epics on disc just as they appeared in theaters, which means edited versions missing critical seconds of gore. I don't know if the ""Madman"" disc is missing crucial gore footage, but I somehow doubt it. Overall, the movie is so unexciting that even an unedited version wouldn't accomplish much.
When you think of ""Madman,"" think of a summer camp and a bunch of counselors. Sound familiar? It ought to considering nearly every other slasher film employed the same fundamental plot elements. In this film, the counselors for a ""gifted"" kids' camp are sitting around a campfire listening to the owner of the place tell the weird story of Madman Marz. According to local legend, Marz was once a farmer in the area who went crazy one day and killed his entire family. Not content to commit such an atrocity and melt away into the forest, the farmer turned up at the local bar and ordered a beer afterwards. What a nice, upstanding member of the community! Moreover, the owner of the camp solemnly swears that speaking Marz's name above a whisper will result in a rather gruesome return of the maniac. Predictably, a goofy kid stands up and starts roaring Marz's name at the top of his lungs. As if that wasn't enough, it turns out Marz's abandoned farmhouse sits just feet away from the campfire. Well, you know the legend is true and that Marz will show up, but what really angered me was the fact that the kid who yelled Marz's name walks away from the fire to explore the farmhouse and thereby escapes most of the ensuing carnage. In a perfect world, this jerk would have been the first one to get it. Instead, the rest of his colleagues go to their doom while looking for this dunce. The whole incident disgusted me, a sensation that only increased by degrees as I viewed the rest of the film.
Another thing that caused me some consternation was a hot tub scene that ranks as one of the cheesiest sequences in film history--and not in a good way. The music playing over this scene was like ice skates on a chalkboard, a stomach churning synthesis of ABBA and the guy who did ""Dreamweaver."" Well, it sounded like such a mix, except it was lamer. By this time I decided everyone in camp had to die or else I would blow a gasket. Anyway, the owner of the camp decides to head into town to play cards, effectively removing him from the nightmare about to descend on the campers and counselors. Marz does indeed show up, although we rarely see him clearly for most of the film. What we see is an extremely unruly mop of hair, some bib overalls, and huge hands and feet. An impressive movie villain, to be sure, except he doesn't do anything spectacular. Oh, he is strong enough, capable of tossing human bodies around with seeming ease or pulling an axe out of a stump with barely a ripple of a bicep. On the surface, Madman Marz promises a heap of bloody violence, but in execution he's a rather timid sort of fellow. His victims tend to go out with a whimper, not with a bang.
The atrocious acting didn't help the movie in the least. Even worse, the cast of ""Madman"" is the least attractive bunch of victims ever dispatched by a psychotic. I have said it once and I will say it again: if you cannot feel some connection to the victims, the slasher movie will fail. This adage doesn't always hold up, but it does for the most part. Not one character in ""Madman"" rose above the role of cardboard cutout/cannon fodder. As if these negatives aren't enough, the gore scenes weren't all that effective. A hanging promised much but delivered little, as did a decapitation via the hood of a truck. I expected a little more grue from a slasher film, but such is life. The positives of the film, including a few suspenseful sequences where we see the shadow of Marz moving around in the background and a surprising ending for a film in this genre, did help on occasion. Overall, though, ""Madman"" is strictly bush league.
The DVD version actually came with a commentary track! This addition to the disc surprised me to some extent since I figured everyone associated with the movie would feel it best to simply let it sink into oblivion. The fact that the commentary isn't that good sort of took the surprise out of the whole thing, but it is there for anyone who wants to waste time listening to it. ""Madman"" is required viewing for horror aficionados, especially for fans of the slasher genre, but all others should ignore the movie.",1073606400,,5334,4.551508844953174
1404813,3,B000059H79,"Let me see...Camp Fire....a bunch of Counclers...children....old scary story of a brutal murder years ago...Crazy madman then kills the counclers...YUP! your typical 80's slasher pick.
This killer is named and horribly so, Madman Marz! He is probally the weakest of the 80 slashers.  So weak the guy couldn't even get a sequel when he well you see what happens at the end.  In the prologe they explain that Madman Marz went crazy and killed his family.  Now that is scary, but then all of a sudden he is a speechless, grunting, Santa looking guy all of a sudden? If they would have kept him more human it would have really worked.
The directer tried to use the same style of John Carpenter's Halloween.  Long shots where you see the victim and then if you are looking close you could see the killer in the background just a little.  Then when you look again he is not there.
If I did an Horror Film Top 100 I am sure Madman would rank in that.  Maybe someone in the 60's or 70's, but I am thinking that might be to graceful.
This movie is a fun pick up and watch with a bunch of friends late at night.  Not sure I would buy this film, but its definitley worth a rental for some late night fun.",1062892800,,1193,4.299107142857143
1404814,2,B000059H79,"I love all kinds of movies, from cultural landmark films to the sleaziest bits of celluloid hidden away in your creepy basement. If I can find atleast one redeeming factor about a movie, then I won't feel like I wasted my time. While Madman would probably never make the AFI top 100 list, and I did have a few problems with it, the movie does have it's moments when it pulls itself free of the banality of it's genre, only to be quickly dragged back under the murky morass by insipid acting, mediocre direction, and cliche after lame cliche.
At the opening, we find that we are at a camp for gifted (cough, cough) children, and we see a small group huddled around a campfire in the middle of the night. There's like seven counselors, and six children. What? I've been to summer camp, and the kid to counselor ratio has always been like 30 or 40 kids to each counselor so I am not sure how the current ratio here actually makes the camp any money unless the parents of the few children that are here are being ridiculously overcharged. Anyway, the group is sitting around a campfire, and we get to hear the story of Madman Marz, a local yokel who apparently went nuts and killed his family. We also find out that the house where he lived is just a stones throw from the campfire. Story goes that if you say his name above a whisper, Madman Marz will come and lop off your head, to which Ritchie, one of the older children, yells out his name in a taunting fashion....stupid kid. As they are preparing to go back to camp, Ritchie sees something and hangs back to investigate. This sets up the premise for various counselors to go one by one into the woods, looking for this dumb kid, and subsequently get killed in various ways. I won't go into who gets killed and how, but the body count goes up at a steady pace.
Some problems I had with the movie. The music is just plain awful. It does provide a little suspense here and there, but it sounds as if it was ripped off from a John Carpenter movie. And right before someone gets killed, they always played the same little bit of menacing music, basically letting you know that someone was about to get killed. Kinda kills the suspense after awhile. Also, the filmmakers tried to create suspense by showing fleeting shots of the killer stalking people, which included various shots of his hands and feet (the killer wore no shoes, deciding to run around barefoot through the woods). Considering the fact that the guy had big, obviously fake, rubber hands and feet, I wouldn't think you would want to spend too much time actually showing how fake they looked, but there you go. And the counselors were so very stupid, annoying, and vacant, even for a movie like this, that I was looking forward to these characters meeting the most grisly end possible. And the killer was like 300 pounds! How the heck does a 300 pound killer sneak up on people in the woods, which he does a number of times? There was one scene where one counselor got the children on the bus and was trying to escape, and the killer attacked the bus, trying to get on...the children didn't even seem to be phased by this. The less than competent acting really hurt this movie. I was a little surprised at the end, as far as who lived and who died, but I was also a little ticked that one character didn't bite the dust. If you watch this movie, you will know who I mean.
The quality of the picture is decent, except for a number of times I saw these lines on the print, right in the middle of screen. As far as special features, there is a trailer and a running commentary audio track featuring the makers of the movie. I listened to a little of it, and I found one point highly amusing. The makers were discussing how they wanted Vincent Price to have the role of the camp owner, and said because it was a non-union movie, that is why they couldn't get him. Yeah, right, that's why Vincent Price couldn't be in your crummy movie....I got a good laugh out of that remark. The sets and the lighting were quite good, although, I have been in the woods in the middle of the night, even when the moon was out, and I don't remember it being as light as it was in the movie, but for the sake of being able to see what's going on, I'm willing to let that slide.
If you like 80's slasher films, then you probably won't be disappointed by this movie, but don't be suprised if you find yourself rooting for the killer, as he's probably one of the least annoying characters in the movie. One last thing, the first counselor to go looking after Ritchie is named 'T.P.'. His over sized belt buckle confirms that this is his name. When he goes missing, various other characters go out looking for him, yelling 'T.P., T.P.!' Where I come from, T.P. is short for toilet paper, and to have these people walking around the woods in the middle of the night yelling out these intials seemed pretty funny. By the way, avoid watching the trailer in the special features section until after you watch the movie, as is common with a lot of movies, it tends to give too much away, trying to cram all the best bits in a couple minutes to attract potential viewers.",1062547200,8,5152,4.3789144050104385

Madman Mars, whose name should never be uttered above a whisper, is a deranged farmer with a bloodlust, whose murder of his family culminates in an urban legend, which sadly for the teenage group of campers (Friday 13th anyone?) who evoke Mars' wrath, results in his pursuit of them for one more night of fun & scares (for the watcher & actos respectively,lol).  The movie is full of all those magical ingredients that modern-day movies such as Scream pay hommage to - sex before death, innocent dying, night-time, girlies running the wrong way, etc, etc.  This is such good mindless fun, with unimaginative dialogue & Joan Collins quality acting.  All in all a blast which genuinely causes a few scares.  Mars is a real looker too by the way!!! Go on, have fun being scared (if you can get past the acting & dialogue).

1404821,5,B000059H79,"I'm not sure what attracted me to this movie, but whatever it was, I'm glad I checked it out. I've always been a fan of slasher flicks (maybe it has something to do with the fact that I was born in 1980, around the time the founding fathers of slasher flicks were releashed -- Halloween and Friday the 13th). The slasher genre is probably my favorite because there are so many films from which to work when reviewing a slasher.
Madman takes place at a camp, complete with kids, teenage camp counselors, and the old guy who's supposed to be making sure the teenagers are watching the kids and not having sex with one another all of the time. The old guy's name is Max (Carl Fredericks) and we start out listening to one of his ""campside stories."" The story he spins for everybody is that of Madman Marz. A number of years ago, Max tells us, a farmer butchered his entire family and then went to the tavern for a beer. Although the town hanged him for his crimes, Marz escaped into the woods and was never heard from again. Max warns his camp not to say the name Madman Marz above a whisper or else they'll piss Marz off and he'll come to get them. At this point, your classic punk stands up and starts mocking the whole story, screaming out ""Madman Marz!""
The Max character is weird because he doesn't act like your typical old guy -- he doesn't mind the teens drinking beer, he doesn't mind scaring the hell out of the little kids, and he always seems to know more than he's letting on. I've wondered whether or not Max was actually Marz. By the end of the movie, I was still not convinced that he wasn't. Max and Marz were played by different actors, but could there be a secret in the storyline that link Max and Marz? There's also a few scenes that place Max too far away from camp to be Marz while all of the killings are taking place. You'll see this weirdness about Max that I'm talking about if you check this film out.
The gory scenes in this movie are quite good. The killer uses an axe as his murder weapon, but we also see one of the teens' heads chopped off under the hood of a pickup truck. Pretty unique, huh? There are obvious similarities beyond the gore to Friday the 13th and Halloween. The music used throughout the film is the most obvious. Others include the ""woods"" and ""camp"" themes common in nearly all of the Friday movies. These similarities do not make Madman a ""ripoff"" -- Madman certainly has qualities that make it standout. For example, in the beginning of the movie, Marz is introduced to us as someone very human -- Max tells us that Marz goes to the tavern and drinks a beer after slaughtering his family. Can you imagine Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees sitting down for a beer after one of their kills ... Exactly!
With all good slasher movies, there's the issue of the killer's face. In the beginning of the film, we see Marz in silhouette, revealing only his wild hair and large body. Eventually we see his face shot from several darkly lit and obscure angles. In fact, his face isn't ""clearly"" seen until near the end of the movie. And even then, it's shot from a moving camera looking up, a technique that has the tendency to conceal whatever it's filming.
Another commonality in slasher films is the sparing of at least one of the teens. This way, someone gets to tell their story to the cops or whoever ends up coming to rescue the camp when it's all over. My guess was that Betsy (Alexis Dubin) would be spared because of her savior-like role. I won't tell you if my assumption turned out to be true, you'll have to find out for yourself. The actress who portrayed Betsy was credited in this film as Alexis Dubin, but she previously appeared in the horror classic Dawn of the Dead as Gaylen Ross. She does an excellent job portraying the smart one of the bunch, even though she makes a few stupid decisions here and there. If I had to pick a smart one, though, it would definitely be her!
Without reservation I add Madman to my list of favorite 80's slasher movies. The DVD quality is excellent -- I only witnessed one scene in which the scream doesn't match up with the victim's mouth. This little error is forgivable considering the wonderful quality that's been preserved in this DVD. Check this one out, folks! Rating: 4 / 4.

Usual routine - summer camp, counsilors get killed blah blah blah (how come the kids never die?). If your one of these people who expects deep characterisation in horror films, then this is worse than Friday The 13th. The characters here aren't teenagers they look more in their 30's so not only does this stereotype them even more so than your Friday 13th style hormone driven teenagers, it also makes them completely boring. So Nil on that score, acting is pretty pants too. However, a slasher film lives or dies by it's atmosphere and blood n guts rating. Gore is cheap and cheesy as ever, just as one would like. There's no budget like low budget as Bruce Campbell once said, however the films score goes up simply on it's killer. Psycho with an axe farmer 'Madman Mars' is genuinly scary as he is scene very little. There's always something inherently scary about those old farmer types anyway me thinks. But there are scenes when all you see is the outline of Mars walking through the woods, that genuinly are creepy. It's unusual for a slasher film to go that route, but perhaps unintentionally, Madman breaks from the traditional 'gorier the merrier routine' and offers a few genuine spine chills. It's by no means in the same class as Halloween as pretty much every other aspect of the film is laughable, but as summer camp slashers go (no pun intended), it's not too bad. It's one of the old Anchor Bay titles with really bad sound and few features, but this only emphasises how low the budget is.

Lastly the ""Beware The Madman Marz"" song at the end was great!  While it may not stand up to Friday the 13th or Halloween in terms of originality or pure horror it sure deserves a look.",993859200,,727,4.511450381679389

7933146,5,B000059H79,"Though low budget as they come, this makes up for those barriers with a steady supply of total originality and that certain undefinable cheesiness that makes a film like this stick in my memory long after i've viewed it.

Mighty weird, and the fact that this movie has grown to cult proportions speaks volumes about it's strange attraction. I'm looking forward to finding the time to watch it again, but in the meantime I will say that this edition released by Vinegar Syndrome outdoes all previous by loading you up with Bonus Features and providing English Language Subtitles as an option. This is the DVD/Blu-Ray combo.

The service by Amazon? This gem was delivered securely and super-fast to our mailbox, and that means a lot to be thankful for.",1507939200,,750,4.8062015503875966
7933147,1,B000059H79,This might be the dumbest slasher film I've ever seen. Ellie is certainly the most idiotic character in any horror film. My guess is the director filmed it without actually watching it.,1505779200,,185,4.8125
7933148,4,B000059H79,"Decent lesser known 80s Slasher. Not one of my favorites to revisit through the years, but had to check out the Vinegar Syndrome Blu Ray. As always Vinegar Syndrome did a great job. Looks great, and packed full of extras. Must by for fans of the film.",1503187200,,251,4.361702127659575
