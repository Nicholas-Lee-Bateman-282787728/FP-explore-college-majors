8102748,5,B000DZ963E,I have been in one of Liz Franklin's Yoga in Chairs classes for a few years. She has helped me regain flexibility and balance after both back and foot surgery. The tape will help you even if you can't come to a class.,1137628800,,217,4.069767441860465
8102749,5,B000DZ963E,"I am a 62 year old grandmother with mild arthritis and a knee problem. This video is a wonderful ""at home"" yoga practice that has improved my flexibility, lessened my neck pain almost completely, and never puts strain on any area of my body.  The people in the video are ""real"" students with varying degrees of abilities; therefore, not intimidating like some other ""senior"" yoga videos which show 30-year old central casting students.  The focus on breathing and being mindful when doing the poses is very relaxing and worth the price right there.  I would recommend this video for real beginners and for people who have tried other videos or classes and found them to be too difficult or confusing.  The time you spend doing these video will come back to you in your overall feeling throughout the rest of the day, or imrove your sleep in the evening.",1137196800,3,853,4.704697986577181
