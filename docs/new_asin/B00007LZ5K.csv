1821257,5,B00007LZ5K,"""I'm going to ( try to )keep this pretty short. This is an excellent movie. I love it. No need to get into great detail. I have this on DVD as it is. Maybe I might want to buy another one just to have a spare just in case something happens to the DVD I already got. But, asking Twenty something dollars for this video & $27.00 from amazon.com is highway & great train robbery !!! I bought my copy on DVD at Circuit City when it was still around for I think like $5.99 or $6.99 maybe in 2002. I think movies depreciate in value , not appreciate. I don't know who thinks or thought that spending up to & over 20 dollars for this video is a good idea , but I thought amazon.com  is supposed to have good prices. I think I should go to a local store where they sell movies like this , maybe at F.Y.E. ( For Your Entertainment ) store & buy it for less than $20.00 . Man , amazon.com .... You guys are getting more & more expensive. This is an excellent movie as I said , but after knowing that I bought this movie , maybe for 10 dollars after tax included , I think people are getting swindled out of their hard earned cash to spend double that. Look for it in stores first. If they don't have it there , then go out on a limb , mad money style , & go crazy & buy this for the outrageous asking price , I guess.... This is all.""",1381017600,,1324,3.903703703703704

1821259,5,B00007LZ5K,"I did not know that (Region two) means it doesn't work in America DVD player.  They were kind about taking it back, even opened, but the shipping cost more than we paid for the movie.  And Amazon was very helpful in making sure we were happy customers despite the whole ""region two"" thing.",1375747200,,289,4.433962264150943

1821261,5,B00007LZ5K,"Being a huge Emilio Estevez fan, I have collected almost all of his movies from the 80's and early 90's with a few exceptions (""The Mighty Ducks"" I just couldn't bring myself to watch, much less own.) ""Men At Work"" is to me a timeless classic. I thought the script was hilarious containing many great quotable one-liners and terrific comedic performances. The brothers Estevez/Sheen play off each other well and it just occurred to me that it would probably be interesting if they starred together in a buddy cop movie but I'm getting ahead of myself here.

This movie is terrific until the end where it seems like Emilio ran out of time or money because it just seems to end without resolution to some of the story lines. This movie is admittedly silly but that doesn't matter because it makes me laugh which is about the only requirement I have anymore for movies. The script was funny and the characters were as well. So what if the story line itself was like cardboard. Aside from Charlie and Emilio, I thought the hitmen as well as the garbage men nemeses and even the bicycle cops nemeses were all funny. I always enjoy Keith David who is a flawless character actor and John Getz is always amazing whether he is playing a good guy or bad guy.

This movie stands the test of time meaning it is still funny to me after all these years unlike some other movies that I thought I would love forever such as ""The Breakfast Club"" which now is a bit boring when I go back and try to watch it. I always thought ""Men At Work"" was great until the end when it turned into a kind of screwball farce. And what happened to James and Carl after they nailed the bad guy? Did they ever get enough money to fund their dream surf shop? Oh well...

As far as this dvd, I was rather distraught over the price- $25!!! I had bought this movie a long time ago and don't remember how much I paid but it could not have been that much. Then I made the mistake of lending it to some jerk who lost it leaving me to have to replace it here now. There are also zero special features contained on it. It looks like Emilio could at least have provided us his fans with something! The soundtrack is good too. So if you are reading this then my guess is you are just a fan of the movie already. I'm not sure what people are supposed to get out of these reviews except maybe whether or not the dvd is worth buying. If you liked the movie and can watch your favorite ones over and over then buy this one. However, I think only true fans of the movie should pay that much for it.",1373241600,,2546,4.245360824742268

The paper in the case (outside) seems authentic and all, but the case is REALLY cheap and flimsy.

1821359,5,B00007LZ5K,"Who would have thought the premise for the 1990 smash hit Men at Work might be an actual reality for Charlie and his brother Emilio? It's almost like looking into a crystal ball mapping out what the future holds for the cocaine cowboy and his mighty ducks cohort. We will tell you that these fellows sling trash bags better then anybody else on the market, proving they may have prior work experience to pull of such a performance. However them being garbage men isn't quite the best part. That would be reserved for the fact that Estevez wrote and directed this masterpiece, assuring the world he's much more then just a high school wrestling star punk. From now on you don't talk to her, you don't look at her, you don't even think about her!

So in Men at Work Charlie and Emilio play a couple of rebellious garbage men taking coastal California by storm. We're gonna go in there and take this club by storm, ohhh! Despite collecting trash they have their eyes set on the big prize in opening their own surf shop. Once that comes through they know they be taking every West coast honey to pound town on a regular basis. Unfortunately their plans becomes disrupted when they discover a body on their garbage route. No it wasn't a passed out Uncle Joe Estevez on the front lawn, it's a murdered politician in a side street. Now they've become the prime target for a mob. Luckily they somehow team up with Seagal's partner from Marked for Death and Francis ""chainsaw"" Grem from Summer School and somehow wing up WINNING. Of course if Charlie's there then all you can do is win.

For us Garbage Men was hilarious in a wonderfully unintentional way. Sure it was packed with horrible lamely written one liners, but the funny part was seeing how cool these two thought they were. They were at the prime of their acting careers and thought this one was going to be it. The type of film where you shake your finger and say ""this guy's got it."" Unfortunately it may have send them both on the downward spiral forcing Emilio to devote his time to playing a hockey coach like 4 times. The only thing missing here was Emilio getting a second chance to smoke a J and run around like a wild man who just mainlined speed. Uh yeah sorry chief, if anything you'd be listening to brain damage watching a wormhole with your buddy, certainly not screaming and shattering windows.",1300320000,,2361,4.526932084309133

Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez are garbage men who, by string of coincedences, get linked into a murder in more ways than one, all through trying to clean up trash.

Sure this movie is a bit far streached at times, and makes two relatively clever characters go from funny to dumb all throughout (Why not just call the cops asap when you find a body????)  Also, no cops were involved at the end either, as near as I could tell...why, loose ends.

At a point when the writers decided to make idiots out of two patrolmen, it would seem. From that point the movie became a formula effort--the meaningless effort to hide a corpse, the ridiculous kidnapping of a pizza deliveryman, the absurd hitmen who can't hit--oh yes, the car chases. The humor became simply juvenile. In spite of its'shortcomings, the movie was entertaining.  Sheen and Estevez are fun to watch. There are some adult gags mixed in with the junior high school bathroom humor. I'd watch this again, but not if a Woody Allen flic were handy.",1062979200,,709,4.764227642276423

If you've seen this movie, you know what the subject line refers to.  Emelio Estevez and Charlie Sheen star in this corn-ball movie about two garbage men who want to own a surf shop.  Because they like to ""have fun"" on their routes, they are placed on probation and have to endure doing their route with an inspector who continues to have flashback to the Vietnam War.
While picking up trash, they stumble across the body of a dead politician stuffed into a trash can.  This provides the ""A"" story of the movie as the trashmen and the inspector carry the body around from place to place after placing a Nixon mask on the corpse.
The ""B"" story involves a rivalry with fellow trashmen.  The ""C"" story involves a couple of policemen who don't like our ""heroes"" and who end up in a embarassing situation.
