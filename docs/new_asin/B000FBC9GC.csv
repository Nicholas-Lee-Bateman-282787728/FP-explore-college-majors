8119878,5,B000FBC9GC,Awesome movie.  I am a big fan of Alexander Fu Sheng.  He was a awesome actor.  I could watch his movies everyday if it was possible. Every movie that Fu Sheng has played in was great.  He could have become an even greater actor if he did not die at such a young age.  You will not be disappointed.,1427587200,,298,3.983050847457627

8119881,5,B000FBC9GC,"I've been waiting for over 30 years for someone to produce a good, clear, letterboxed version of this movie, and BINGO! Red Sun has done it for me! Should you get yourself a copy of NA CHA THE GREAT? Well, if you tend to love Alexander Fu Sheng as much as I do, or if you can't say no to a good Shaw Brothers flick from the Chang Cheh era, then the answer should be a resounding YES!

The story is based on Chinese mythology. Na Cha, played by Fu Sheng, is a young deity who was carried in his mother's womb for 3 years or so, which may explain some of his ""father's"" hostility towards him. One day Na Cha escapes his rather sheltered home compound and learns that life is not as peachy for everyone else as it it for him, that in fact injustice and mistreatment at the hands of the governement and the aristocracy are all the common folk have to look forward to. Poor innocent Na Cha. This new found Knowledge gets him into all sorts of trouble with his father who is first in line when it comes to abusing the less fortunate in this district. It also gets him into trouble with the Ocean God whose son he winds up killing. In order to appease the Ocean God and his own father as well as to save the peasants whom the Ocean God has threatened to drown, Na Cha commits suicide.

But this is just the beginning! There are more demons and dragons and a helpful god who resurrects Na Cha and gives him some spiffy new weapons to help him out before this one's over! And for a change Fu Sheng's character doesn't die at the end! What more could a fan want? Except good choreography which thankfully NA CHA THE GREAT also has in abundance.",1204070400,6,1634,4.2006369426751595
