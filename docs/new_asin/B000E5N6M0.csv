2494288,5,B000E5N6M0,This is a great show. It is one of our favorites from the time that we were kids. Great family shows!!! The Dvd's are nice to have so you can watch them over and over again. Plus you'll want to see them too!!! Its a great purchase for a Waltons fan.,1151884800,3,249,3.9019607843137254
2494289,5,B000E5N6M0,"Like the previous seasons, The Waltons - Season Three, contains very strong stories that depict strong family and moral values, along with just as strong moral dilemmas and situations.  In this season John Boy goes off to college, and meets a wider world than he's known. A world in which his family must also now enter from time-to-time.

The world of 2006 is so far flung from the world of 1939 -- yet, we need to be reminded of those traditional family and moral values that helped people stand up under economic depression, world tyrants and even every day struggles just to make a living.  Such values are timeless and have an eternalness that cannot be diminished.  We may ignore them, and do in many ways in our ""modern"" society, but they do not go away.  These stories have many lessons to teach that we need to learn or re-learn; how to love unconditionally, how to really care for elderly parents, that respect of one-self must come from respect of others, etc.

This third season, as are all seasons of the Waltons, is worthy of your review.  TV has never been better.  Enjoy.",1151539200,6,1087,4.595854922279793
2494290,5,B000E5N6M0,I am enjoying many wonderful memories of my youth watching the Waltons all over again! This season has been the best so far. I hope the next season is released very soon. This was when television was at it's best!,1151107200,2,213,4.35
2494291,5,B000E5N6M0,"""The Waltons"" is first-class television!  Longtime fans will not be disappointed. Season Three continues the ""family oriented"" stories while Will Geer (Grandpa) and Ellen Corby (Grandma) were still vital and active.  There are many, many touching episodes here and this will disappoint none of ""The Waltons"" admirers.  The great thing about the early seasons is we still John Boy and the complete cast intact and the kids are still charming and young.  But I can't wait for the fourth season to be released as that one has my all-time favorite ""Waltons"" episode on it...""The Burnout"".  Hurry up Season 4!!",1146355200,9,605,5.070707070707071
2494292,5,B000E5N6M0,"Just bought this wonderful series to add to my other two seasons and although I haven't watched it yet, I must say that I am pleased with the improved packaging. Seperate slimline cases are much better than the discs all in one. Warner Brothers must be improving their other programs as well, since Full House, season 3 is also like the Waltons this time.  Can't wait to watch!",1145923200,13,377,4.544117647058823
2494293,5,B000E5N6M0,"I enjoy this series as much as any. It is up there with Hawaii Five-O. Unfortunately, that show is not available as of yet. Not sure why, but it isn't! I certainly will buy season III, I own season I & II. However, my favorite episode is from season IV, The Intruders. This is where wiley old Grandpa outwits a new lumber yard and wins a big contract. Keep releasing these episodes, it was great TV and gave us a feel for what it was like growing up during the Great Depression. I makes me appreciate my parents, and how hard it must have been to survive.",1143504000,22,555,4.196261682242991

2494295,4,B000E5N6M0,"I can't wait to buy this set. I already own the first two seasons.

BTW - for the person who said, ""John-boy gets Blue the mule"", that's not true. He gets him at the beginning of season two (in the episode where he delivers the baby). Just a heads up.

We meet Grandpa's sister-in-law Martha Corrine, her son Boone, and grandson Wade. The conflict is over the county forcing Martha Corrine off her home and land in order to build a road. It will break your heart.

Also, John-boy begins college, Ike and Corabeth get married, John-boy enters a dance marathon, Grandpa has a heart attack right before his birthday, and John-boy gets Blue the mule.",1137024000,65,497,4.847058823529411

 Okay, now that I am over being angry, I am in the process of buying all of the Walton DVD's. We, my wife and I watched these programs with our childre and it was great. The thing I liked about them is that they re-enforced the life lessons that I was trying to teach my youngsters at that time. Watching the Walton's is how I grew up, poor as Church mice but we always found ways to have fun. I guess we got into trouble a bit as well. Good programs all and I recommend them to you, especially if you have youngsters.

I had actually borrowed the first series from the library and did not even view it because I prejudged it and decided I would not like it.  But actually, I have found it to be a nice reprieve from the violence and morals of 'mainstream' DVD's.  The series shows a family with trials and happiness, but always a strong family bond founded on love.  It doesn't have any 'action' that is so common today, but it's warm and sweet, which left me feeling very positive and upbeat.",1361404800,2,541,4.38

The one thing I didn't like was with this season and the fourth: The distributor packaged all the DVDs on top of each other instead of separately like they did with the other seasons.  While they are finally one-sided discs, they are now prone to scratching by stacking the discs.  Other than that, I give five stars for the series and disc quality, and nothing for the packaging.

2494936,4,B000E5N6M0,"The set of ""Waltons: The Complete Third Season"" DVDs that was released on April 3, 2012 is not packaged very well, in my opinion.  Within the plastic case, all 5 DVDs are stacked directly on top of each other, directly in contact with each other.  And they aren't particularly easy to get out, because the central piece of plastic that I think we are supposed to push down on, in order to get the DVDs out, is very rigid and holds the DVDs tightly.  After getting them out, I immediately placed them into separate DVD cases that I had bought.

As far as I know, the only difference between the 2012 release and the 2006 release is the package design.  As evidence of this, the DVDs themselves have a copyright date of 2003 on them.  I don't know how the 2006 release was packaged, but I can hardly imagine that the 2012 release is an improvement.

I haven't yet viewed these DVDs, but after doing so I'll update my review if I have anything significant to report.  Having not yet viewed them, it would be unfair of me to rate this item less than 4 stars.  ""The Waltons"" series (specifically, the first five seasons) itself deserves 5 stars, and so I took one star away for the packaging.",1337040000,5,1187,4.408256880733945

A Professor William E. Ghote. (Billy Goat) He has also left his admittance cetificate at home. When his father drives up in his old truck the snobby college youths start making fun of it, but John-Boy tells them proudly, ""That's my father."" and runs to meet him. John Boy has something they wistfully long for. A father with a strong character who has brought up his son the same way. Another episode I enjoyed was called 'The Thoroughbred' when John Boy enters a race against a rich college friend who has a thoroughbred horse. John Boy only has the family mule, but Grandfather Walton helps John Boy by telling him which way to take the mule over the mountain. The writing and direction of the Waltons episodes are always first class, making us long for the days when families helped each other and stood up for each other, and were taught lasting Christian values.
With 36 episodes to enjoy it is well worth the investment. I've only seen the First, Second, Third and Fourth Seasons, which are all brilliant, and soon I will be investing in Season Five.",1297987200,7,1345,4.5850622406639

What a treat to go back and see how times used to be.  It was a wonderful era, but not so great for some familes that lived through that depression.

2495024,5,B000E5N6M0,"Season 3 finds John-Boy a freshman at Boatwright University, realizing his longtime dream of attending college and becoming a writer. Of course, it isn't easy -- unable to afford the cost of living there, he must commute the 28 miles each day. That's the least of John-Boy's problems, however, as he struggles to fit in amongst rich classmates who never thought twice about whether college would be in their future.

Back on the mountain, the other Waltons are also growing up and branching out into the larger world. Mary Ellen, who has just begun pinning her hair up each day, attends her first college dance with one of John-Boy's friends. Jim-Bob, sick of being ignored by the elders, learns that running away from home isn't the answer, either. Having nursed a lifelong interest in art, Olivia finally musters the courage to sign up for a free adult education course...necessitating that she learn to drive!

Character development isn't limited to the Waltons, either -- store owner Ike, single for so long, finally meets a woman with whom he immediately falls in love.

Despite this being its third season, the warm supportiveness, tinged with humor, of the Walton clan remains as strong as ever in this DVD set.",1181606400,3,1218,4.902912621359223

The ethics and values that were the bedrock of our country's greatness are captured in these episodes that are digitally re-mastered in excellence! What a great collection to have... for the sake of remembering those days when they were on prime time tv... and what a chance to share a good glimpse of what virtue in American culture is and how it attributes to the quality of life regardless of economic struggle with those generations who cannot connect life in the Depression or the great Recession of the mid and late 70's.,1168300800,4,640,4.723214285714286

2495062,3,B000E5N6M0,"The third season of the Waltons continues the tradition of meaningful family entertainment. Just like the first two seasons, there are wonderful episodes in this season as well, with extensive character development in the children, John and Olivia Walton, and of course the trials of aging in Zeb and Esther Walton. The family members are so real, the plots so interesting, and the acting so excellent, that one forgets that this is a show.  It is so engrossing, it is like watching a real live family.

The biggest disappointment for me is the quality of the reproduction.  The first two seasons displayed superb video reproduction.  The color is vivid, the film is scratch and blotch-free, and the sound quality is clear.  Unfortunately, the third season episodes show none of these quality markers.  My version shows scratches, blotches, poor faded color, and an inferior sound track.  Much to my disappointment, the quality is not any better than taping the shows off the television. To produce the episodes without cleaning up the scratches and imperfections is uncharacteristic of the Walton tradition.  The Waltons is a show known for its quality, and here are reproductions that fall far short of acceptable quality standards.

While it is nice to have the third season on DVD, viewing the episodes in this shoddy condition is a major drawback.  I hope the producers of this series clean up their act and clean up their tapes before producing season four.

2495089,5,B000E5N6M0,"Like so many others, I too watched the original broadcasts of the Waltons for many years and loved being transported back in time to a place where family mattered, friendships were cherished, and life was not all about ""getting stuff"" as it is today.  It seems utterly impossible to find decent family programing that is newly broadcast these days, so our family has turned to tried and true old favorites.  We have the entire collection of the Little House on the Prarie series, and that was the best purchase our family ever made for entertainment!  My boys (yes boys like Little House too!) are 7 and 3 and gobbled it up.  I was able to use it as a reward for getting chores done and bathtime out of the way.  I was literally BEGGED for another ""ma and pa"" show.  That got me thinking about other shows that I enjoyed as a child that were wholesome, taught morals and values, and were also entertaining.  The Waltons was the first one that popped into my mind.  Watching these shows is a breath of fresh air...no foul language, no sexual innuendo, no having to fast forward to get past violence.  The nice thing is that it also isn't dumbed down sitcome-style entertainment, but instead is a drama that truly draws your entire family into the story lines.  We all long for simpler times without cell phones beckoning us and computers allowing us to work from home.  Poverty wasn't a sin in the time of the Walton's, lack of time for the family was.

I can't tell you how much we are enjoying this series, and like others, we simply wish we could go and buy all the years at once to devour!",1155081600,18,1592,4.451724137931034
