8447911,5,B000NQDB0W,"I've been watching dorama {Japanese does not have a ""dra"" sound} for a decade now. Mariko is my favorite character out of the hundreds I've seen. The title has been translated as ""Woman of the Crime Lab,"" but the character is so strong, the show is usually known in English as ""Investigator Mariko.""

I was part of the way through my first season, and CSI came on CBS. The Japanese show was so much more interesting to me, I couldn't watch the American version. But keep in mind, Japanese television has quite a different ""flavor"" or ""texture"" than American TV. It might take a bit of getting used to it. But this is an excellent series for anyone interested in giving that flavor a try.",1308528000,,687,4.496
