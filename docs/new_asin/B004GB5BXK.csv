8428582,4,B004GB5BXK,"I  finally viewed a copy of Mya Communications DVD release of Director Giovanni D'Eramo's 'DEATH WILL HAVE YOUR EYE'S' aka 'LA MOGLIE GIOVANE'- 1974. I was putting it off because of the negative reviews on the quality of the film's presentation and ,Yes , it is pretty shoddy.  The film is a tragic series of events in the life of Louisa played brilliantly by actress Marisa Mell and its inevitable aftermath .  Having come from poverty and finally settling in a profitable city, she meets up with Yvonne played with minxish aplomb by gorgeous Helga Line who  shows her the ropes and gets her a job in a hotel.  Both look for La Dolce Vita as Yvonne falls for a lover half her age and Louisa goes for the big bucks in surgeon Armando played blandishly by American actor Farley Granger.  They marry and soon the ennui settles as Louisa  can't handle the posh parties and classical concerts thrown at her.  Complaining to Yvonne about the good life that she desperately wanted,  she decides to have an affair with Armando's surgeon buddy, Stefano and then the films heat starts boiling.  She decides to do  away with Armando but she doesn't count on a voyeur played menacingly by Francisco Rabal witnessing the murder.  Rabal naturally sets the blackmailing wheels in motion and now Luisa has to settle this score as well right up to the films tragic conclusion.  The title of the film derives from a poem which is played during the movie that actor Granger uses to meditate? by.  The copy of the film seems to be derived from a splicy, warbled VHS print  and the only asset is its Italian mono soundtrack which is crystal clear  so you can appreciate the music score by Stelvio Cipriani  which emerges as one of his best.  The tragedy is you can't appreciate the photography by Francisco Sempere and although the print is in 1.85 widescreen format, the images are presented in the colors fading in and out in separate intervals as you are watching.  Mya does supply stark, legible English subtitles to understand the dialogue.  I gave the four stars for the films performances and storyline by Director D'Eramo and Antonio Fos .  If you can withstand the DVD's quality, you will find a really gripping affair which for this viewer is not a Giallo per se but emerges as a tragic wanting is better than the having exercise in futility.  Although the image of Marisa Mell on the DVD's box cover is not from the film itself, it does boast one of the best performances by Mell who shows she really had the chops for good roles instead of disrobing for some Director's exploitive purposes.  It's a good movie which deserves a decent digital restoration.",1467417600,,2646,4.655172413793103
8428583,5,B004GB5BXK,It is an interesting film and Melissa Mell is always watchable. The story line was good. Well worth the cost of buying it.,1439251200,,122,4.3478260869565215
8428584,1,B004GB5BXK,"Luisa has messed her life up. Most of the film has her confronting her blackmailer inside her recent deceased's husband mansion with her boyfriend hanging about. Very boring stuff. Poor DVD transfer.

The only interesting thing about the film was the that Luisa commented the Rolls Royce electric clock made no noise. At one time Rolls advertised that the loudest thing in the car was its electric clock. Lincoln made a car with a quiet clock and advertised their car was quieter than a Rolls Royce. Rolls changed their clock and came out with an unprecedented ad claiming ""We fixed the Clock.""

8428585,1,B004GB5BXK,From now on i will be really carefull before ordering a MYA DVD as this one truly suck. I can live with the audio but the picture quality looks like a really really bad VHS transfer and is probably cropped to.,1321833600,12,209,4.121951219512195
8428586,2,B004GB5BXK,"I only give this two stars because of Marisa Mell otherwise it would only get one. The film itself is not a giallo despite claims to the contrary. Worst of all is the quality of the transfer. It looks like it was made off of a VHS dupe. Terrible!  MYA should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this. To add insult to injury, the trailer on the DVD has better color and is English language, which is obviously how the film was shot. The movie itself is in Italian with English subtitles.",1320537600,10,495,4.32258064516129
