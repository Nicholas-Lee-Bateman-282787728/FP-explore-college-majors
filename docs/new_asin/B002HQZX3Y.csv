3934380,5,B002HQZX3Y,I like everything about this very unusual Christmas story that was written by Max Lucado. William Moses was just fine and I thought that Stephen Chapman who played the pastor of the town in Texas looked enough like William Moses to be his brother. Nice Texas swing music in parts and it was nice to see Texas again.,1390435200,,315,4.448275862068965

3934385,5,B002HQZX3Y,"Awesome family viewing, The Christmas Child is a great show about forgiveness and finding ones self, in a very hard and hurting world. I love Steven Curtis Chapman, Billy Moses (from his Falcon Crest days) and Megan Follows. The 2nd movie deals again with forgiveness and mis-understandings and once again how allowing yourself to be vulnerable can lead to wholeness and healing. 2 excellent family movies for all ages and great moral lessons to be learned in both.",1293840000,2,465,4.9743589743589745
3934386,3,B002HQZX3Y,"The Christmas Child is a wonderful story of family.  A one person's search for the truth of his last leads him to his future.
A time to Remember a sad story of how losing a loved one can be a challenge.",1289260800,,202,3.926829268292683
