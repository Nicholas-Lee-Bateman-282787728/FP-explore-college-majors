5277593,3,B0099116AY,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones provide yet another acting lesson, this time as a married couple of 31 years. Their marriage has gone stale to the point Kay (Streep) signs them up for a 1 week getaway in Maine for marriage therapy. Arnold (Jones) wants no part of it, but reluctantly goes along, bitching the whole time. While Arnold and Kay don't even sleep in the same bedroom any longer or even touch each other, there is still some deep rooted love needing exploration.

The explorer/therapist is played with perhaps a little too much seriousness by Steve Carell. Surprisingly, the story is short on humor. The best scenes involve watching the couple squirm when the issue of sex is discussed. It's pretty much all there in the trailers but Kay and Arnold and their issues will certainly be recognized by many in the audience. There's not much of a story here, but it's always enjoyable to see Streep and Jones do their thing, this time together.",1349913600,3,951,4.6946107784431135
5277594,4,B0099116AY,"When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-in-Love/dp/B0018RC7QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling in Love</a>&nbsp;(1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000MKD9P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.

An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.

At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple. Frankel overdoes the soundtrack music when moments of silence would have been far more effective, but otherwise, the tone feels spot-on.",1349654400,80,4358,5.502985074626865
5277595,5,B0099116AY,"Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, and Steve Carell prove their worth as actors in roles they seldom play, but they all did a stellar job. As usual for these box-office hit professionals. Carell as Dr. Feld who takes a week to turn a stagnant 31-yr-old marriage on it's un-bridled love heals. Kay and Arnold are the couple who have to face marriage sexual reality in front of a shrink. Viewers feel as awkward as the characters are portrayed. Good acting makes this good story achieve greatness.

It's scenic, since the Omaha couple travel to Great Hope Springs, Maine for the intense week of therapy. And it's quite believable. It's emotional, like the struggles and high points of a real marriage after 31 years. In Feld's office, it goes from pathetic to comic. Intense to relief. Moments of endearment and others where the revelations become loud and in-your-face. Sometimes I wished I could hide myself, other moments I squeezed my wife's knee. She watched in the theater seat beside me. She immediately informed me we must buy the DVD when available.

OK, it's not for all. It's targeting older, mature viewers.
Teens will growl ""gross"" during the clothed sex scenes.
Young marrieds may envision their parents or grandparents.
Ladies 40 & over will find it lusciously romantic.
Older men will/can learn a few tips to sweeten your own sweetie. Works for me, 64 and alive.

5277638,5,B0099116AY,"Such a fantastic movie. 2 of my favorite actors.
It is so fitting for couples who have been together for several years or more.
It really brings home what is important in life and how  making assumptions about how your partner feels/thinks, can turn your life upside down. Needlessly!!
Talking about things, even a little bit, can prevent years of misunderstanding and even worse, heartache. Heartache that is brought on by one assuming something totally incorrect. Heartache that gets worse and worse because of what one person has decided in their mind. Not based on any facts what so ever.
The tiniest amount of communication can make a life time of difference.
How much of our lives are wasted because of worry and fear of the unknown.

Steve Carell, Tommy Lee Jones, and of course Meryl Streep were all fabulous. I usually love Meryl Streep, but a few of the movies she's been in haven't appealed to me at all, so I was not sure what to expect here. And I also didn't know what to expect between her and Jones, but they were beyond impressive and believable in this much-needed film. If you've ever gone through a deep healing in your relationships, I think this movie will appeal to you.  It can be very easy to get stuck in ruts in life, with ourselves and with a partner, and sometimes, when we stay in them for a long time, breaking out can be painful and hard... but there is good help out there when we seek, and there is always hope.

5277719,3,B0099116AY,"At the start of Hope Springs, Kay and Arnold (Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones) have been married for thirty-odd years, and their passion has faded. The two sleep in separate bedrooms, with Arnold usually falling asleep watching the Golf Channel. They don't touch each other, they don't kiss each other, and they most certainly do not have sex. They are roommates, not lovers. During sessions with a marriage counselor (Steve Carell, in a strong and understated performance), we see glimpses at what caused the deterioration of their relationship: back problems and snoring moved Arnold to another bedroom, and a temporary solution became a way of life. Neither Kay nor Arnold are completely blameless in the problems of their marriage, and neither is completely culpable. Unfortunately, the film never delves too much into their relationships deterioration, leaving much of their conflict unknown (some viewers may embrace this ambiguity, but I found it to be a sort of lazy cop-out).

I liked the first two-thirds of the film fairly well, despite the flaws, but I cant quite recommend this film overall. The third act is very formulaic and some of the music used is so literal that it becomes grating. A fight during a therapy session and a montage of them walking around separately afterwards? Well, cue Everybody Plays the Fool by the Main Ingredient. A scene of them trying to rekindle their romance? Cue Al Greens Lets Stay Together. A low point in their relationship? Annie Lennoxs Why. A glimmer of hope? Lenny Kravitzs It Aint Over Til Its Over. You get the idea. Overall, Hope Springs is watchable, but hardly essential.",1483315200,,1630,4.992647058823529

A better screenplay that removed any strained attempts at comedy and focused more on the couple's history could easily have vaulted into Oscar territory.

I'm just not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this film.  If not for Tommy Lee Jones and Merryl Streep, I wouldn't recommend it at all.",1457222400,,561,4.616161616161616

After thirty years of marriage, a middle-aged couple attends an intense, week-long counseling session to work on their relationship.

What did I think?

Five-star acting in a good but not great movie that will soon be forgotten.

Despite having Steve Carrell in it, Hope Springs isn't a comedy. Its more insightful chuckles than laugh-out-loud and, while its intelligent, this is probably the largest failing as it seems unsure of itself when it comes to the laughter.

Poor pacing doesnt help, but the incredible performances from Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee-Jones, and Carrell are almost worth the admission tickets. Almost.

At the end of the day, the storyline is largely forgettable and I really didn't need to see Streep masturbating.",1431734400,,753,5.181818181818182

His character simply was not believable.

And as for the ""therapist"", his questions could just as easily come from a call centre manual.

Forget the sex, there isn't any. Or was there one or two seconds of viewer participation in imagining something was going one - possibly sex but then again it could have been bed bugs.

I am getting bored even remembering it to write this review, thank goodness I will never have to see it again.

Pity - Meryl Street did her best but her partner was somewhere else (possibly catching up on sleep) and the script was amateurish at best.  It most certainly was not a comedy.

5278677,2,B0099116AY,"If your idea of a fun movie is sitting in on someone's marriage counseling, by all means watch this movie. However, that's not my idea of a good time and frankly it wasn't even interesting. I borrowed this movie from the library and the blurbs on the case used words like ""funny"" and ""comedy,"" but they lied.

I thought with Steve Carell being some big therapist the couple had to fly out of state to see, there was going to be some humor there but his part was totally straight and very conventional. I have no idea why anybody would spend big bucks for such therapy, a brand new college grad could have provided the same quality of therapy. Even with us (the audience) sitting in on the therapy sessions, we never really learn why the main characters have ended up the way they did. And a LOT of the movie consists of therapy sessions.

Yes there were a few chuckles here and there and a heartwarming ending, but I really only kept watching because with such good actors I felt sure it must get better (wrong).

If you don't agree with my review, please just enjoy this movie, write your own glowing review, and don't slam me. I'm entitled to my opinion and maybe someone else will benefit from my review. Sorry to be on the defensive but movie reviews seem to be a world unto themselves. I'm just trying to be helpful.

5278680,4,B0099116AY,"I am a total sucker for a romantic comedy and much less so for a romantic drama.  Hope Springs falls mainly into the latter category albeit with some very funny incidents.  This is a PG-13 rated self described comedy/drama.  There are love scenes between people of my age which should not be inflicted upon the impressionable minds of the youth.  We actually want them to reproduce and we don't want to throw them off task.  Still, I was captivated by Hope Springs.  This is a four saw blade film that many of us in will understand.  If you stay away from action flicks or horror movies, and who can blame you, go see this one.  You will be touched and inspired.
 Tommy Lee Jones (66) and Meryl Streep (63) play a couple somewhat younger than their actual ages.  The couple has been married for 31 years, hasn't been intimate for four years and barely notice that they are growing insular and lonely in their own home.  The wife, Streep, arranges a get-a-way weekend in Main to attend an intensive marital training session to improve the communication between the couple and hopefully re-generate some affection and connection.
 Steve Carrell, a comic of great skill and success, plays this one absolutely straight.  He has the manners and inflections of a professional marriage councilor down to a tee.  He is careful, kind, understanding, non judgmental and above all, firm.  He gives the uncomfortable couple no wiggle room, no place to dodge their disappointments or their duties.
 Tommy Lee Jones is such a powerful screen presence that it is difficult to see the character behind the actor, but he pulls it off.  Jones is perfect as the tired, nearly sixty, husband who no longer has any hopes or illusions.  He only wants peace.  Jones is bored, tentative, angry and eventually courageous and charming.
 But Meryl Streep is beyond compare.  She surely is the leading lady of the silver screen and will remain so just as long as she wishes to continue working.  She can do more with a look or by not moving a muscle than most actresses can do with a nude love scene.  She is top notch.  And she is a worker.  She makes loads of movies and in between she appears on both the small TV screen and live theater.  I loved her performances in Julie and Julia and The Devil Wears Prada.  I thought Its Complicated, her recent romantic comedy was beneath her talent but the public ate it up, a caution against giving too much credit to critics.

 This two hour and one minute drama has a lot to recommend it to seasoned citizens, who have the wisdom and the mileage to appreciate the fine writing by first timer Vanessa Taylor.  Director David Frankel also directed the successful Marley and Me and the Meryl Streep vehicle The Devil Wears Prada.  With a smallish $30 million budget this extra fine film has brought in a purse fattening $80 million.
 If you get to see this movie you will be as pleased as the newly enriched producers.  Do it.",1414713600,,2941,4.615830115830116

5278700,5,B0099116AY,"I wanted to give it four stars because it made me so uncomfortable in places. But it made me uncomfortable because it was so so SO well acted.

Maybe one of Streep's best performances. She is an amazing actress in the larger than life roles. I've seen her in a couple of roles that were ""regular folk"" but her... Amazing-ness always sort of hovered over the characters to me; even in ""Bridges of Madison County"" she played with such eligant craftsmanship that... well it was a little too...smooth? Anyhow. This one. She was so real, so vulnerable, so ""normal"" that I genuinely felt her humanity.

Jones also was amazing. His character appears to be a regular jerk, but Jones allows us very subtle and effective glimpses of vulnerabilities that the later parts of the film are believable. At first I was praying she would leave him. As the film progressed, I flip flopped on that several times. The fact that I could root for that marriage at all was owing to his acting.

Mr. Carrel was very straight and sincere and professional. As any really good ""shrink"" would react, not a bit of judgement or humor or silliness ever crossed his face. Only empathy, sincerity, the efficiency of a professionally detached yet experienced, caring and direct expert in his field. That was how the character came across, due to the expert acting.

The story. Not a comedy at all from my view. I have a friend who is in her 70s married 50 plus years. She advises ""There may be years, YEARS, that you don't like a person, but in a real marriage the love is always there."" This film illustrates how divorce can happen, and how healing can happen. Healing can be extraordinarily uncomfortable. It is very tempting to give uncomfortable things low ratings or chuck it off entirely- but in this case... five stars for dealing caringly with a common and awkward subject with genuine humanity and brilliant acting.",1408752000,,1890,4.7009063444108765

5278742,4,B0099116AY,This is a cute DVD. After spending a lifetime together there is still hope for love. I thought it was great to watch as an older woman,1394841600,,134,4.0

5278744,5,B0099116AY,This movie seems to be one the most honest and touching depiction of marriage after numerous years.  It is endearing but makes no mistake that marriage is hard work and that you must do your best to liven it up and show appreciation for one another.  Love the actors in the movie as well,1393804800,,287,4.296296296296297
5278745,5,B0099116AY,Loved this movie and it shows how people grow apart that do not want to grow apart and that they can fix it with help even if it is a weekend away,1393632000,,146,3.59375

5278752,5,B0099116AY,These two actors are the only ones that could carry this movie off as far as I am concerned.  They are very believable in their parts.  It is a great story about a couple that drifted apart and were able to reignite their passion for each other,1391644800,,244,4.170212765957447

SPOILER ALERT:
In one scene, Meryl Steep and Tommy Lee Jones are given homework to touch each other sexually. All I was thinking the whole time was god I hope I don't see Tommy Lee Jones get an erection.

On a more personal note, I hate Steve Carell and I didn't hate him in this movie.

5278775,5,B0099116AY,"Loved the storyline and the actors involved.  Deals with an all too common problem in a realistic manner.  Hopefully, it inspires couples to rekindle what they once had.  I bought it to share with a few couples I know.",1387238400,,218,4.538461538461538

""practicing"" with a banana, but it's in this one. Tommy Lee is his crusty self, and gets through a movie with no shots being fired. Steve Carrel (Carell?) is very good also, I usually don't care much for him, but he's watchable in Hope Floats.  This is definitely a chick flick, but us old guys can sit through it at least once, maybe twice ...",1386892800,,617,4.220338983050848
5278777,5,B0099116AY,It's absolutely hilarious and has a lot of truth to it. The wife had seen it with our daughter and mother and told me it was a must have now it is getting worn out because we watch it all the time. It deffinately opened my eyes to what I have with my wife. We laugh all the time.,1386806400,,279,3.7457627118644066

5278779,1,B0099116AY,This movie was a total waste of my time.  It was not even close to what I thought it was.  Kinda want my two hours spent on this back.,1386633600,,134,3.586206896551724
5278780,4,B0099116AY,"I could watch Meryl Streep in almost anything, and Hope Springs is something I will return to at least once a year. It's a mix of drama and comedy, but it doesn't try to make you laugh with every line of dialogue. Kay (Streep) has been married to Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) for 31 years. The two barely talk to each other, despite living in the same house. He hasn't touched her physically or mentally in any kind of meaningful way for several years. Kay decides that she wants to recapture the magic and give new life to their boring existence. She cashes in her savings and arranges for the two to attend couples therapy with Doctor Feld (Steve Carell).

After initially refusing, Arnold reluctantly agrees to Kay's ultimatum and the two fly off to attend the sessions for a few days. Arnold is grumpy, deeply suspicious of Feld, and afraid to show his real feelings. Carell plays things straight for once and is convincing as the therapist.

I think the movie has limited appeal because of the nature of the humor. It's the kind that will make you squirm and maybe recognize things about some of your own past or present relationships. Even if you don't, you probably know someone in a similar situation to Kay and Arnold.

The movie is quite uplifting in it's resolution and it is a pleasure to watch two such accomplished actors at the top of their game. The writing is strong and the performances are real.

If you are looking for a romantic comedy with a bit more depth than most, Hope Springs might just work for you. It certainly did for me.",1386547200,,1548,4.517857142857143
5278781,5,B0099116AY,"The acting and the writing are superlative.  Not because it's a HUGE BIG story.  Because it's small and ordinary.  This is a story about mundane ordinary people who have gotten into a rut.  Never, ever, do you feel like you're watching a movie script being acted out (much unlike Alex Cross which I watched immediately preceding this - Yay Matthew Fox - even if it was a caricature of Max Cady - down to the workout and tattoos) .... all else... ho hum - truly a poorly written script... but i digress) Perhaps this is the greatest beauty of Hope Springs.  To watch 100 minutes of these extraordinary actors breathing life into the most ordinary people you've seen on film in some time - and it's captivating.

The extras, all of them, are worth watching in the DVD set.  There you can see even more of the actors' master class as you view outtakes of particular scenes.  I loved it for the acting.  the quiet nuances.  I found the story achingly realistic and I understand why younger viewers may find the movie dull and boring and many have said it's NO Rom-Com.  They cannot relate to it.  I don't have a relationship that resembles these two, but I can see the pain, beauty, comedy and well, the art of what they've done here.  Every scene really is magnificently done.

Watch them in the theatre with barely any words being spoken.  Watch them in front of the fire.  See her sad longing and her courage to step up and do something about where they are.  Whatch this curmudgeon step WAY out of his comfort zone, in a BELIEVABLE way.

This is Love - long ignored, perhaps never living up to expectations.  Love having a chance at rebirth.  Just watch it.  But maybe not before you're 40 :-)  It's not an exciting movie.  It's a real love story of two people who gave up hope of fantasies and settled for existing together -

Watch them discover love.  You will be happy for Kay and Arnold when the credits roll and maybe take away a few tips to ensure you don't end up where they started.

Enjoyed the music as well.  Great storytelling in the lyrics - the familiar songs of the Main Ingredient, Annie Lennox, Lenny Kravitz  and Al Green and a song. ""I don't want to be your mother"" by Rachael Yamagata are perfectly placed.",1386547200,,2227,4.445544554455446

Actually the actors look a little better with some age on them. The primes are not that interesting. The excision is mechanical. It looked like each character was acting by his/her self and they just patched it together to make a film. It's like watching Dr. Phil on steroids.

The film starts to get repetitive and then just quits.",1384300800,,589,4.764705882352941

Can't believe that these tow stars who have been in such great classic movies, allowed themselves to be talked into this one. Definitely a waste of money and don't even think I would watch it if it was broadcasted on regular TV",1379980800,,303,4.428571428571429
5278811,5,B0099116AY,"I'm sure there are few in this film's target audience who aren't at least aware of Tommy Lee Jones's exploits as Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, MIB Agent Kay, and other such action-based roles.  So to see him portray a husband living a quiet life in a nice house would certainly be surprising.  One could only wonder how he'd do.
  But Mr. Jones does as fine a job as ever as he is forced into marriage counseling by his wife.  Speaking of his wife...Meryl Streep is as brilliant as ever as a woman wanting to bring a spark back into her marriage now that she and her beloved are empty-nesters...you can tell right away when she is trying to convince everyone, including herself, of the value of the new cable subscription that she and her husband got each other for their anniversary.
  However, the scene-stealer of the film was Steve Carell.  When I heard that Mr. Carell was playing the marriage counselor/relationship therapist in this film, I had expected a comedic version of the profession...not too different from Robin Williams's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Will-Hunting-Miramax-Collector-s-Series/dp/B004SIP7ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>.  But Mr. Carell delivered yet another of the film's pleasant surprises.

I expected this movie to be more along the lines of It's Complicated which was a very cute movie. With that said, Hope Springs is not funny in the slightest in fact it is just creepy.

5278822,3,B0099116AY,"[There are two ""Hope Springs,"" so be sure which one you want before buying.]

A 2012 American drama ""Hope Springs"" stars Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones as Kay and Arnold Soames, a married couple of 31 years. Dissatisfied (sexually, I mean) with her life, Kay buys a book written by a marriage expert Dr. Feld (Steve Carell), signs up for an intensive one-week marriage counseling session with the doctor, and travels to Great Hope Springs, Maine, with her reluctant husband, who would rather be watching golf on TV.

""Hope Springs"" is often referred to as a romantic comedy, but I think, to most viewers, the film looks more like a filmic adaptation of a serious stage drama. During the session Dr. Feld calmly asks Kay and Arnold most embarrassing questions. Don't expect anything overtly comedic here. Steve Carell delivers a muted, low-key performance, bringing little to the role. Blink your eyes and you will miss Elisabeth Shue. The film's focus is always on Kay and Arnold Soames, struggling to keep the marriage going.

The best part of the film is cast-against-type Tommy Lee Jones and his fine performance. Were it not for the final ten minutes (together with the end credits that are certainly amusing), I would give the film three stars or even more. Directed by David Frankel of ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" ""Hope Springs"" plays it too safe, despite some honest commentaries on marriage and sex.",1377129600,,1406,4.874476987447698

Had this movie been set twenty or thirty years earlier I might have been better able to buy the storyline -- 60ish couple married over 30 years haven't shared a bedroom or had sex in five years. Wife Kay (Streep) has a parttime job in a friend's yarn and gift shop, husband Arnold (Jones) is a CPA (apparently the only one in the firm not making a good salary, as all he does is complain about the cost of everything). Wife tries unsuccessfully to seduce husband, who apparently has forgotten what certain body part are for, and decides to revive their marriage at a Hope Springs, Maine couples facility, run by Steve Carell. Arnold is  resistent to everything -- doesn't like the charming town, although he has plenty of money can hardly deal with a $12 breakfast special, and at first stonewalls every suggestion that involves sex, which means he stonewalls every suggestion as they all involve sex. Kay is more open but has some areas that bring her discomfort to discuss. The ending is very predictable.

While I think that both Streep and Jones make a believable couple of the old school -- I think we have to assume that at least Arnold is among the oldest of the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 - 1949, with Kay a few years younger -- I never for an instant believed Steve Carell in his role. He played it lowkey, but he seemed to just be puckish Carell to me: my reaction was, ""oh, look, Steve Carell again."" With Streep and Jones I was able to eventually accept that they were not like  most couples that I know, due to the quality of the performances. But with all the constant emphasis on sex among the elderly (sorry, but mid-60's is not middle age) even without the aid of some erectile dysfunction drug, much of it became cringe-worthy. It was like listening to a relative or close friend talk about oral sex -- TMI! Streep looked her real age thoughout the movie, not much make up, slightly plump, but still attractive.

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

 I had high hopes for 'Hope Springs' and was not disappointed, as it was directed by David Frankel, responsible for the excellent 'Devil Wears Prada'. How can you go wrong with icons such as Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones who have great chemistry together as Kay and Arnold Soames, a middle-aged couple, who have lost the spark in their marriage?

The film proceeds methodically and with great subtlety as the stultifying relationship between the couple is stripped away during marriage counseling sessions with Dr. Bernie Feld (here Steve Carell does an excellent job playing a 'straight man', in a rare non-comedy role).

When we're first introduced to the 'ordinary world' of Kay and Arnold, most people who have been married for a long time, will see quite a bit of themselves in this relationship. Arnold (a partner in an Omaha accounting firm) has alienated his wife through his curmudgeonly ways--watching golf on TV all the time and showing her zero affection. The most exciting thing that Kay reveals to her adult children, who are visiting for the holidays, is that they've just purchased a new cable TV subscription.

The inciting incident occurs when Kay dips into her savings and purchases a one week getaway in Maine, to see Dr. Feld for ""intense"" marriage counseling. Arnold thinks it's a ridiculous idea and Kay announces she's going anyway, whether Arnold decides to go or not. The fact that Arnold joins her on the trip despite his earlier opposition, is significant, as it indicates that he's not completely hopeless.

As we break into Act II, Kay and Arnold begin having counseling sessions with Dr. Feld. Arnold's resistance to therapy is quite strong in the beginning but they do have a breakthrough when they're able to hug one another in bed (this is Dr. Feld's 'sexercise #1'). The stakes are raised when he begins asking pointed questions about their sex life. Kay is so inhibited that she admits that she's had no sexual fantasies during the life of their marriage. The minor 'victory' of cuddling in bed is short-lived, as we arrive at the 'mid-point' with Arnold storming out of a session after he fails to take responsibility for sabotaging Dr. Feld's 'Sexercise #2' (touching one another sexually, in bed).

What Arnold actually doesn't like is being exposed as a hypocrite, self-righteously asserting that he made all these sacrifices for Kay (such as never cheating on her, as this was some kind of badge of honor). In reality, he can't own up to the fact that he's withdrawn all affection for his wife and almost has completely sabotaged their relationship.

The second half of Act II, reveals a series of obstacles that crop up, seemingly preventing the couple from achieving intimacy. First is the frank discussion that Kay and Arnold have about what they don't like about one another. Dr. Feld then asks them to have an intimate encounter in a public place (his request ends disastrously as Kay tries to give Arnold oral sex, in a movie theater).

Finally, the therapy appears to be working, as Arnold's attitude appears to be changing. He manages to book dinner and an overnight stay at a fancy inn/restaurant in town (instead of the Econolodge, where they've been staying outside, on the outskirts of town). They both drink and retire to the bedroom, where they begin to make love. The second act crisis is brilliantly depicted, as Arnold won't look in Kay's eyes while about to make love, and appears to abandon interest. Kay is shattered over Arnold's indifference, which she believed, he had overcome.

Dr. Feld likens the failure to consummate, like ""fumbling"" on the first yard line. He argues that when they first came in, they were merely in the parking lot, before going into the stadium. But Feld's words are of little consolation to the couple, especially Kay, who believes her goal to re-establish intimacy, has failed.

But Dr. Feld was right all along. When you strip everything away, and the true emotions rise to the surface, eventually the damage will be repaired. So Arnold finally does have an epiphany and returns to the bedroom with Kay. The 'coda' at the end, where the couple renews their vows, is tantamount to the knight reclaiming a lost sword, after a mythic 'trial by fire' journey.

Kay and Arnold are generic characters, and we only get to see a little of their back stories during the film. This isn't important, since we should be more interested in viewing the dissection of their relationship, through the film's narrative. One could argue that the film's scenarist, could have done more with the Dr. Feld character, as he seems to be too much of a 'perfect' therapist, but I'm sure there are those couples out there, who have undergone this kind of therapy, who will swear by therapists such as Dr. Feld.

'Hope Springs' is more dialogue based, than an image based film. But due to the riveting performances of the principals, one's interest remains riveted throughout the film. For those who wish to be emotionally uplifted, 'Hope Springs' is for you.",1372118400,,5093,4.866050808314088

Of course with such a great cast how can Hollywood go wrong.  Ya they have in the past but not with this one! This is a sincere look at an aging relationship that has become stale.  Meryl Streep plays a dedicated housewife that is still in love with her husband of 30yrs.  Tommy Lee Jones plays her faithful husband that has shelved his desires and in fact turned them off all together. A muted and perfectly played therapist Steve Carell delves deep and picks at some wounds adding further depth.  You feel for these characters and you are these characters.
Worth adding to your collection.",1371600000,,605,4.626168224299065
5278857,4,B0099116AY,"Hope Springs is, as you can probably guess given the actors and actresses starring in it, mostly suitable for the older (50 years or older, if not 60) marriage couples.  Of course this is entirely a comedy so you're supposed to be laughing... and the good news is that it *is* a funny movie overall.  Believe it or not however, several portions of the film actually provide useful information for any couple who's marriage no longer contains the spark that it once did.  I'm referring to the parts that focus on Steve Carell playing the part of the marriage counselor.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones of course play the wife and husband, and they are very good in their respective role.  Almost *too* good, haha.

Meryl Streep wants to seek a 4,000-dollar counselor to help figure out her marriage, and with much reluctance, Tommy Lee Jones eventually decides to go along with it.  Now admittedly some portions of the discussion that takes place in the marriage counselor room are pretty graphic and personal, so please be prepared for these sexual-related discussions that focus on the act itself, the sexual position in which is most enjoyable for them, pleasuring ones self, etc.  It gets somewhat dirty (or honest, depending on your viewpoint) but this is really the *only* part of the movie that ever approaches this level of dirtiness.  The rest of the movie is remarkably clean and appropriate.

Now, I've never been married so I've never been to a marriage counselor, but the way these meetings develop gradually seems incredibly realistic.  The comedy takes a much subtle approach than what I was expecting.  For example, the moment the personal subject of sex is brought up with graphic and specific questions, and Meryl buttons her shirt as a way to reveal she's uncomfortable going into detail, is an example of subtle comedy that's easy to miss if you're not 100% attentive.  The ending is perhaps one of the more unique endings I've seen.  While you can probably guess what happens at the *very* end, the stuff during the final 20 minutes is somewhat surprising to me.  Just goes to show how bumpy a marriage can be over the years when everything becomes static and nothing changes.  The VERY final line is incredibly funny though.  I won't spoil it, but something is said involving the neighbors during the marriage counselor meeting earlier on, and when it's finally brought up again near the end... NOW I get it. :)

As a man, as weird as this may sound, this movie actually shows me how much women care about marriage.  It's important to a man too of course (because it involves two people making major permanent changes that the other has to adjust to) but Hope Springs further proves how important it is for a woman to connect with her spouse on a personal level and physically touch them in bed.  Good detail there.  The one thing that's hard to believe is that, this marriage got to the point that Meryl and Tommy Lee were no longer sleeping in the same room anymore.  Has anyone out there heard of a marriage getting to this point?  Even the people I know who have rocky relationships- they always end up sleeping in the same bed at least.  *Always*.  Seems somewhat far-fetched but I could be wrong.

Overall, great movie.  Of course given the fact the cast is over the age of 60, you can probably guess that it's going to be a slow-moving down to earth type relationship storyline, and trust me, it is.  You have to really slow down your thinking process to appreciate the style that's taking place here.  You don't necessarily need experience in marriage troubles to grasp it, but it would probably make the movie even more rewarding if you did.",1370822400,,3673,4.6953125

5278894,5,B0099116AY,"This was a lovely film about an older couple who has been married for 31 years.  They both have settled into the routine of their lives.  The wife is very aware that it has grown stale and she longs to have that spark put back into their relationship.  The husband doesn't understand this, but when he realizes he might lose her and that she is serious, he unwillingly goes along with it.  What truly makes this movie are the two lead actors, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  They both offer exceptional performances bringing comedy and drama into a real life situation.  Meryl ads just the right girlishness into her character, Kay, while Tommy invokes a guy cut off from all emotion as her Husband, Arnold.

Although these days I wonder who is still around that has been married for 31 years. My generation doesn't seem to have a handle on long term relationships to begin with. They do not know how to make it work or are even aware of what it truly entails. It's not all hearts and roses. This movie would be a great documentary on how to show that marriage and long term relationships are serious business.

Kay enrolls she and her husband into a week long extensive couples therapy session in Hope Springs, Maine. It's a quaint, cottage like town where everyone knows that many of the visitors are there to meet up with the head couples counselor, Dr. Feld, played by Steve Carrell.  Kay is desperate to revive her marriage at all costs and Arnold will be forced to get into it whether he likes it or not.

Do they find a newness in each other and passion for what was once there?  You'll have to see the movie to find out.  I enjoyed this look at a married couple finding an avenue to breath new life into their relationship.  It was very honest and moving.  The movie manages to keep it light while finding just the right moments to bring in the emotion.  This is mainly successful due to the gifted actors playing the roles.  In less capable hands, this movie would've fallen into a snooze fest.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are a delight to watch in action.

Other movie goers who prefer the blow 'em blockbusters that move at a fast pace will likely be bored with this though. I imagine those not knowing much about the seriousness of relationships will also likely want to slit their wrists while watching this. I loved it and I think anyone who has had problems in a long term relationship will be moved by this movie.

5278905,3,B0099116AY,"Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones): inattentive,insensitive husband
Kay (Meryl Streep): unhappy wife in need of attention and affection

I felt for Kay often. And Arnold? He was so complex, which made him the most interesting character. Did this man realize he was taking his wife for granted? I don't think he did. I wanted to know his backstory to find out why he had such a problem with showing affection.

Marriage: It's not how many years that matters, but the relationship. Arnold kept saying he and Kay were married for thirty-one years as if that meant something when it was obvious their marriage was in trouble. The focus was mainly on their sex issues, but they had other issues. I found it interesting how their position on the marriage counselor's couch each time they went told a lot about the progress they were making resolving their problems.

So basically, Hope Springs is a well-acted dramatic film about a married couple needing help with their sex life. There were parts I wasn't comfortable with,but, all in all, it was okay. It gives unhappy married couples quite a few things to think about.

Favorite Lines:
Kay - ""I want a real marriage again.""
Arnold - ""Four-thousand dollars. That coulda been a new roof.""",1366156800,,1223,4.809523809523809
5278906,1,B0099116AY,"Really did not like at all. I have the impression that it is not a comedy, it is not drama, it's, for me, a no well mix of an intempt of both, with the inconvenient of the obvius great expectations that come from the two wonderful actors that are in it... definitly not a well outcome, really hate it!",1366070400,,301,4.11864406779661
5278907,4,B0099116AY,"There is something almost sad about the way in which `Hope Springs' is received as a comedy.  I mean, while watching the film I couldn't help but smile and or chuckle uncomfortably in certain spots, but the film truly is NOT a comedy or even really all that funny when viewed in the context of the film and so there is something tonally off about our willingness as a society to view this as a comedy based solely on the fact that the main protagonists are an old couple.  Seriously, watch the same movie with some young actors like Anne Hathaway and Joel Edgerton and you'd have a very serious and somewhat heartbreaking film.

Instead, we laugh.

`Hope Springs' tells the story of Kay and Arnold.  Their children are grown and out of the house and their relationship has dissolved into a puddle of mundane and they suffer through routine and engage each other nearly NONE of the time.  Kay is fed up and wants a real relationship, with talking and sex.  Arnold is not interested.  He's content with the way things are.  That's when Kay throws counseling in his face and basically says ""I'm going with or without you, but without you means this marriage is over"" and so Arnold begrudgingly gets on the plane.  Next thing you know they are sitting in front of Steve Carell and spilling their guts (or at least Kay is) and he's giving them exercises that Arnold is hesitant to perform.  He doesn't even want to hold her hand.

The concept of the film and even the overall handling of it are truly dramatic in tone and rich with so much meaning and yet they are bogged down by this preconceived notion that `old people making love = comedic gold'.  I don't understand this idea and yet I fall victim to it myself.  The scene in the hotel room when they are getting passionate on the floor would have been seen as hot if actors twenty years younger were cast in the part.  Instead, we as an audience are reduced to chuckling like prepubescent children who heard someone say the word ""wiener"".

It's silly and disheartening.

Still, my uncontrollable reaction and all, this film is far more engaging and speaks to a deeper place than I expected.  Streep and Jones are wonderful here, each playing off one another with so much heart and soul.  Jones is especially effective as the stone hearted gruff who learns to let his guard down (sort of).  I highly recommend this film, and I recommend you watch it twice, that way you can get over the shock of it all and then watch it with clean eyes and an open mind.",1366070400,,2504,4.485651214128035

5278925,5,B0099116AY,"Critics praised Tommy Lee Jones' Oscar-nominated performance in Lincoln and, true, it was the only spark of life in that overblown, overrated miniseries-like yawnfest, but it is in Hope Springs that he really shines and comes out towering.  Predictably, people kept raving about Meryl Streep because praising Meryl Streep is like praising Steven Spielberg - it seems to be required even though deep down you tell yourself, well, were they really that great this time? Oh, don't get me wrong, Meryl was just fine, but she was upstaged here by Tommy Lee Jones. She seemed in awe of Tommy Lee throughout the film and the press they did for Hope Springs (and she will work with him again in his next directorial effort, The Homesman). Her awe of him was appropriate because you really believe that Kay loves her husband Arnold with all her heart - it helped that Meryl had an actor with tremendous presence who was not only as highly skilled as she is but was truly touching and attractive, someone who can infuriate you one moment and make you want to take care of him the next. People forget that back in the 80s Tommy Lee Jones was a woman's supporting actor - that's how I came to know of him. In real life he is the Harvard scholar son of a former police woman in Texas and consequently, no doubt, has a healthy respect for women that shows through on the screen. I didn't grow up with the big barker of The Fugitive or the stone-faced K of the MIB films - I grew up with tender-hearted Tommy Lee Jones warmly backing up Sissy Spacek in Coal Miner's Daughter or Sally Field in Back Roads (underrated gem - check it out) or Jessica Lange in Blue Sky. What you have here in Hope Springs is a fusion of the Big Barker and the Tender Heart - Tommy Lee as Arnold undergoes a rite of passage. He has taken his wife for granted, lives his life by rote - and one day she makes him wake up and see that they need passion in their marriage, something to look forward to, and he undergoes a transformation that is truly touching. And of course his dry wit shows through in the marriage counseling scenes - isn't the phrase 'Tommy Lee Jones in sex therapy' enough of a selling point?.  He is a true joy to watch. Check out this film and the other films I mentioned, and you'll see that it is too simple to label Tommy Lee Jones as nothing but a grumpy curmudgeon or barker. But if you must label him as a curmudgeon, well, he is the most lovable one since Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond.",1364688000,,2475,4.354978354978355
5278926,1,B0099116AY,"Hope may spring eternal, but not for a monotonous reminder that marriages go sour from a sexual and emotional standpoint long before middle age.  Not only is this something you don't want to be reminded of when you go to the movies, but it does not, as presented, even rise to the level of engagement of a routine television soap opera.  I mean, you have Tommy Lee sleepwalking through the film, basically grunting and ignoring Meryl Streep, whose cutesy, guilty little smiles are supposed to indicate she still has an interest in rekindling the flame.  Only there really isn't much if any chemistry between them, the script is banal, and the actors seem both embarrassed at and hostile to the subject matter.  Who could blame them?  And so they seek out sex therapist Steve Carell (who seems like a wormy little guy with no real personality), and sit widely physically separated on a couch, while he asks them the usual cliched questions -- ""do you have orgasms? do you experiment in bed?  are you ready to try something new?""  Could the actors possibly have read and agreed to a script this predictable and uninteresting and bad, with virtually nothing by way of characterization?

The story is held with a certain dramatic range, there are no hysterics, yet important and realistic points are addressed.  Very nice scenery in New England also.  One difficulty is Steve Carrell playing a purely dramatic role.  Not the best choice, because of his huge exposure in comic performances.  It unfortunately detracts from the overall quality, as he is not a dramatic actor in the class of Streep and Jones.",1364256000,,570,4.835051546391752

The wife was just as lost in some respect, but thankfully they realized their life ""together"" for the rest of their lives, was more important than not trying to restore intimacy in the marriage.

Lee Jones, two of the best veteran actors still working today.
In the wife's eye, the husband seemed to have lost interests in her and growing remote.
She's unhappy and arranged a meeting with a marriage counselor well-played by Steve Carrell.
It is basically a three character movie well-directed by ""Devil Wears Prada""'s David Frankel.
The first half of the film works well till the movie theatre scene which is neither funny nor believable.
After that the relationship took a downward turn before the happy ending.
The character and motivations of Meryl Streep, the wife, were well illustrated and presented.
It is the character and motivations of Tommy Lee Jones, the husband, were inadequately written and presented.

In particular, the writers seem to have no clue about their subject matter - the couple portrayed is from an era at least 40 years out of date, the location in Maine shows a relative ignorance of the place, and there is lack of continuity in the development of the plot and the characters.

Unfortunately, not so much. Although it does have a few humorous moments, it is really more about the deeper marital issues that a long time married couple is facing. I think the movie is done well, the actors are great together and the story is touching. Not the laugh's I was hoping for but it certainly tugs at the heart.",1361404800,,491,4.290322580645161

The story of a couple yearning for intimacy is very relatable. I don't want to give away the plot line here but will add that the movie does not quite take the expected turn that a viewer imagines and that makes it all the better.,1361318400,,362,4.5

It's just like experiencing the problems and emotional pain of real life relationships that one often experiences when they are unhappy and stressful. With the state of the economy and overall stress of our troubling times, I would rather escape the sadness of the real world and be uplifted, entertained and inspired when I watch movies. I did not feel any of these by watching this movie, even with a ""happy"" ending that actually did not make sense to me given just how unhappy this couple was. It was difficult to believe that they could overcome their serious issues. For the most part is was well acted, but in the end, I didn't ""buy it.""",1361232000,,731,4.587786259541985

5279044,4,B0099116AY,"...and that says quite a lot!
There is nothing new about stale marriages, but this film is anything but stale. All the nuances, the irritability, the indifference and so on, are well captured in this study of hope over experience.  Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding as the bored, somewhat awkward husband, more in love with his accounts than his wife - where routine has totally eclipsed any spark of romance.  Meryl Streep, while she never gives a sub par performance, nevertheless seems to flirt ever more with stylist mannerisms with every film that passes. This does not detract from her fine depiction of the frustrated and exasperated, dutiful wife, but certain of her expressions and mannerisms, like her special way of smiling, tend to repeat themselves from one role to another.
Still, that is only my own personal opinion, and shouldn't put you off this very accomplished film",1361232000,,883,4.95945945945946

I get the feeling that the subject matter was just a little too meaty to deal with in film. I was expecting a silly comedy, but the funny parts were laced with pathos, so it was bittersweet rather than ""lots of laughs."" Streep was really brilliant, as was Steve Carrell, who played the marriage counselor. I've decided that the movie was worth watching, but I won't watch it again to catch easy-to-miss moments. The value of the movie is what it evokes in the viewer, which is a personal review of one's own life. I'm not sure that younger viewers will really get it; as a matter of fact, I hope they never do.",1361145600,,726,4.338235294117647

  It focuses on a side of an old married couple that I've never seen done before. Jones' character does seem a little cruel at times to the point that it seemed a little ingenuous (that a an old couple that loves each other this much could really treat each other like that) but not enough to ruin the movie. Other than the subject matter, it wasn't all that special of a movie.
  I did enjoy it, but the story and visuals were nothing special earning it a three, maybe a three and a half. Unfortunately, I can't give a half, and it seems like its on the shorter end of 3 and half, so its better fit with a 3 than a four.

I was rooting for Meryl all the way as she was trying to put some spice back into her marriage yet realizing she may have to make the final decision to move on for herself, if necessary.  Tommy was great as the husband that had lost interest after many years of marriage and was willing to settle on living that way to 'death do us part'.  I was cheering for him when he start to try to make an attempt--wish my husband would surprise me with a nice dinner at a hotel and a room for the night with all the romantic extras--even if it didn't work out the way he had planned.

5279139,3,B0099116AY,"This is the third movie I've detected in this line, the first being Jack Nicholson's ""About Schmidt"";  It seems DeNiro was in another one more recently---old men taking road trips to get together with their kids after the Wife dies.  In this send up, the Wife is still very much kicking.  Meryl Streep, our leading chameleon, is now about as frowsy a housewife as could be, and still be respectable.  She's well worn, yet smarter than her perpetually cheerful demeanor would seem to indicate, and she wants a marriage, or more specifically Her Marriage, back.  Her curmudgeon of a husband, perfectly played by Tommy Lee Jones, has the occasional fantasy---apparently featuring a neighbor--but no interest in his wife, whatsoever.  So she books a flight to Maine, to see a renowned relationship counsellor, for them both, and takes off without him, having given her husband the Ultimatum.

It's not an adventurous film, aside from having older actors, no nudity, sex, violence or special effects (apart from Ms. Streeps makeup).  It's funny, touching, and sometimes a bit sad, by turns.  It'd make a great afternoon film.  Of a similar vein, one could go to the radio program ""This American Life"", to it's archives (a few years back now), and look up the title ""Someone To Watch Over Me"", where the second show in that program features a retired SF Bay Area cop and his wife, in the rut of ruts, until she decides to go to Mexico with her girl friend.

What Hope Springs presents is a story about two boring old fuddy duddies who were once two young boring fuddy duddies who never had much passion or spark to begin with. Meryly Streep was sexier in her Julia Childs' role, although she and Tommy Lee Jones deliver well drawn comedic profiles and make the movie watchable, even funny at times. Steve Carrel is wasted as the shrink. Too bad. Hope Springs needed an interesting subplot to give it the double-shot of Geritol with a Jack chaser that it needed.",1359590400,,616,4.660550458715596

Once I got past that, I was able to appreciate the masterful performances Streep and Jones give in this movie as a 'mature' couple struggling to rekindle the intimacy in their marriage through an intensive counseling program run by Steve Carroll's character. Jones is outstanding as the gruff, stoic, uncommunicative and often angry husband who reluctantly faces emotions long repressed. The few comic moments are his, as he blusters along, and at times finds the wry humor of the situation. Streep is always fun to watch, and is mostly earnest and heartfelt in this film. They both mug just a little, but it's enough to keep it entertaining without it going overboard. Carroll mostly plays it straight and does a great job with his therapist role. The insights on marriage are so true, and will resonate with anyone who's been married for a period of time.  There are some flaws in the movie - some of the contemplative scenes seem very cliche, with music booming while the characters stare remorsefully out over the sea, but other than that it is spot on. And I applaud a movie like this getting made - there aren't many films getting made about romance between characters over 50.

Of course, Tommy Lee plays the bad guy here for a while until they both find out things about each other that they didn't know during their therapy sessions with Steve Carell. I'll have to say, this is the first time I have seen Carell play a serious part and he does a great job. Their therapy is a hard struggle and so is breaking old habits within their relationship.

This might sound dry and hopeless but the incredible skill of the unlikely couple of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, lend more than just credibility into the lighter moments and they reach deep inside you with the painful moments and share a knowing kind of pain in such a way that by the movie's end you can relate completely. It was painfully dry in places but it served a purpose - to make you feel what they felt in the husk of a life gone dead. Brilliantly done by all!!

5279203,3,B0099116AY,"Okay- so we have two great movie stars playing a long married couple.

They have marriage problems, only Tommy Lee Jone's character doesn't think so.

 Or at least doesn't admit to it.

He looks at Meryl Streep like she has 3 heads when she suggests this * get away* for the two of them.

I mean why would you want to get away with your wife? And much less to a place that is supposed to * help* your marriage?

As far as he is concerned- there is nothing wrong and he resents her suggestion.

 It does not take long for arm-twisting to work on him- via a sense of guilt and worry.

He caves in, thanks to guilt, not an outward recognition of marriage problems.

 Tommy Lee Jones makes no bones about how much he hates going- then hates being there, and what a big waste of time and money the whole idea is.

Basically ,he is a wet blanket, while Meryl tries to remain cheery and keeps plodding ahead with the game plan for the two of them.

She wants her marriage to be like it use to be- or - if possible, even better than it use to be, when she was happy.

Tommy Lee remains totally oblivious to her unhappiness or to the fragile state of their marriage.

Meryl Streep as the silent, long suffering wife, who should have spoken up many years ago, can only sit and wring her hands over his antics and foul attitude during their *get -away*.

He embarrasses her- he is curt and hurtful.

I was actually wondering why her character even wanted to stay married to him!

His portrayal as such a cantankerous, cold husband was convincing.

What was not convincing is Meryl's desire to want this man to remain as her husband so badly, that she sets up this trip as an intervention.

The movie would have been great if there had been more substance to the plot.

I mean, it was not like Meryl and Tommy Lee did not play their parts well- it is just that you got a glossing over regarding each of their characters.

I would have liked to have  known them better- especially the past versions of themselves,instead of who they were at the time the movie takes place.

  So yes, I feel the movie suffered from lack of character development or any revealing insights about the characters lives over the years.

 Flashbacks to their first meeting and early days of marriage would have been nice, too.

  Just when did this marriage begin to grow stagnant?

And why would anyone let it remain that way for so long?

 These are questions I had and I realize this movie did depict real life and how marriages can suffer from neglect; I was just waiting and hoping those answers would come as I watched patiently.

(Instead, I was rewarded with a movie that just sort of dragged along; keeping enough momentum to make you want to know how it was going to end, while still watching the clock to see how much time was left to wrap this whole thing up.)

 Soon, I found myself becoming annoyed at the whiny couple- when initially I had been sympathetic toward Meryl's character.

 1 hour or so into the movie,  I found myself annoyed as I realized it just was not going to get any better.

I am glad I rented this one and did not see it in theaters.

 Both stars are enjoyable to watch, but  in far better movies they have made over the years.

In my opinion, this is worth skipping. You won't be missing much.

5279239,5,B0099116AY,"For my money Meryl Streep is the greatest actor on the planet.  It's amazing how she manages to transform herself physically and psychologically into a totally new person with every character she plays.  I was reminded of her character in The Devil Wears Prada as comparison to the meek, quiet and rather ordinary housewife she plays here.  Her performance is always worth the price of admission.  This film is a bit bizarre and, at times, over the top with scenes between the characters that made me somewhat uncomfortable.  I mean who wants to watch two old people having sex?  Yet it is done very honestly and addresses a very real issue in the lives of many people.  Jones is always Jones to some extent.  He seems to have cornered the market on cranky old guys.  But he does it very well and it was fun watching him morph back into a different mind set.  This is a ""Must See"" movie for married couples over the age of 50.",1358467200,,926,4.458333333333333

5279242,5,B0099116AY,"Tommy Lee Jones should get the Oscar for this one.

I've never seen him in this kind of role - a role that most leading men in Hollywood would have eschewed. Who wants to be seen as a wrinkly old curmudgeon accountant? Grr and snore. Yet Tommy Lee Jones plays this role fiercely. Extreme realism. I really disliked his character. It had to be hard for someone so used to playing the hero or the cool guy. Wow, what an actor!

Meryl Streep's character was not as complex as I would have liked. Her resolve was simplified down to her one desire to get her man to return to intimacy with her. Life still went on his way, the boring way. I have to say that I cried more than laughed at this movie, and was angry a lot during it. Most women I know want something more out of life than this character did. Even Edith Bunker from ""All in the Family"" had more chutzpah than Meryl's character.

Still, though a simplistic treatment of a very complex issue, the movie deserves to be watched for Tommy Lee Jones' amazing acting skills and courage to play an unlikable character, and for Mr. Carrell's cagey performance as the shrink who held the steely position necessary to force the couple to work through their process.",1358380800,,1211,4.42152466367713

My hopes sprung from the anticipation of a movie that would truly bouy up the thought that hollywood could turn out an endearing film that encouraged couples, couples at any stage in their marriage, to revisit their relationship beginnings and finding the time to enjoy being with one another in mutually enjoyable settings as well as living through the rigors of everyday life.
This film simply focuses on the inept directions of a supposed therapist with regard to the couples lack of sex in their life as the be all end all fix for their marital woes.",1357862400,,631,4.592920353982301
5279296,4,B0099116AY,"To begin with the title of the film HOPE SPRINGS is not a location. Rather it is about the hope that after years of marriage love and emotion can return. It's what the film is about. While some will watch and assume as the discussions involved talk about sex, that isn't what's at the core of the film.

Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) have been happily married for years now. But times have changed. Anniversary gifts are now just shared items they need for the house. Arnold hasn't slept in the same bed with Kay for years now starting from a back injury he suffered long ago. This is a couple that has a daily routine where Arnold wakes, gets ready and goes to work with Kay making sure his day starts off with the same breakfast every morning and a peck on the cheek. But that's not enough for Kay.

Kay longs for the affection and intimacy that the couples shared all those years ago. Determined to do something about it, she seeks out marriage counseling books at the local book store and comes across one written by Dr. Feld (Steve Carell). Digging deeper she finds his website online and then makes reservations for her and Arnold who of course refuses to go seeing it as a waste of money. Kay gives him two options: join her at the airport or stay home alone.

Fearing he might lose her, Arnold shows up begrudgingly. They arrive on a remote small town in Maine where their week long couples retreat is to take place. Arnold is the crotchety type who complains about the costs of everything, insisting all the while that they have no reason to be here.

As their sessions begin Dr. Feld talks to them about what the problem seems to be. Carell plays the role straight and doesn't resort to what some would expect of him. Feld cares about the people he treats and allows them to bring out the questions and answers that are plaguing their marriage. Where the obvious questions about their sex lives are discussed, you can tell by the direction he leads the couple in his questions and what he discusses with them it's not sex he wants them to dig deeper into. It's intimacy. It's the small caress that Arnold might brush across Kay's cheek or a kiss on the lips. But these topics don't come out at the first session, instead taking time each day they are there.

One of the best things here is that the story unwinds and we discover that it's not all Arnold's fault that things have changed. One would think that was the case with the attitude he has toward the whole process and with some of the answers he provides. What we have here is a couple in every sense of the word where both share equally in the changes that have overtaken their lives. And the only way to save this marriage is for both to become an active part in that marriage once again.

This movie isn't the dry film that it might sound like from what I've written so far. It's filled with lots of humor and out right affection seen in the characters offered. These seem like real people you and I know in real life, people that have a deep rooted love for one another yet have somehow lost touch. You care about both characters and watch hoping that they find the solution they need.

Long time readers will know I've never been a big Meryl Streep fan but here she does a tremendous job, offering not just great readings of her lines but displaying subtle touches like body movement and longing glances that open up her character. I've always found her performances much better in roles like these than grandiose characters she has played in the past. Jones is amazing to watch. He has the grizzled old coot character down pat and if that were all he displayed here I would say his performance was mailed in. But as the film progresses you see that there is a weakness inside of him that blooms and allows his affections to finally show in this character. Since neither of these characters is in your face, my guess is both performances will be ignored come Oscar time.

As I near the age that these two people are in the midst of, the movie made me look back at my own life and will do the same for anyone in their 40s on. Young viewers might want to look at it and realize what they can expect down the line unless they pay close attention. In any event this movie was a delight, offering insight into what is truly important in the lives and love of people. It touches on many levels and it is definitely a movie worth watching.",1357776000,,4423,4.391941391941392

Absolutely no narrative trajectory, no insight into why either of them behaves as they do and even less explanation of what brings about the final happy ending. You're left feeling like too much ended up on the cutting room floor.

And I just couldn't get used to Steve Carell in a serious role. He's fine, but you keep waiting for the zinger that never comes. A few jokes would have been an improvement.",1357516800,,636,4.628318584070796

Kay makes an appointment with a marriage counselor who specializes in intense marriage counseling and Arnold refuses to go but finally shows up.....

This is an excellent movie about a married couple trying to restart the passion and love that brought them together in the first place.  The acting was superb and the storyline was well written as it had laughs and sad parts.  It is well worth watching and who knows, it may rekindle your marriage or at least make you look at how you and your wife treat each other.

This film will most likely have a hard time finding its audience.  There are too many cringe-worthy sexual references and scenes for the older crowd and painfully slow pacing for the younger crowd.  I fit into the middle-aged crowd and let's just say that I would never attempt what Meryl Streep's character attempts to do in a movie theatre.  Awwwwwkward.
I had high ""hopes"" that this film could be a good ""spring""board for rekindling marital intimacy, but would a couple (in this case, primarily the wife initiates the crash course) really find intimacy once again by racing through the romance part of a marital relationship only to jump right into acting out intimate sexual fantasies - with no comfortable middle ground?

Meryl Streep (Kay), Tommy Lee Jones (Arnold) and Steve Carrell (Dr. Feld) go free-form in therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine.

One piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of...Ok, you get the idea here. Like Arnold's unchanging daily breakfast, their marriage of Thirty-One years is stuck in a routine, and hurt feelings. Kay, feeling ignored, inhibited and unfulfilled after all these vested years, decides to investigate for help. Will curiosity kill this cat...or awaken the sleeping lion?

Eventually, she finds Dr. Feld's book in the bookstore. While at home she jumps on the internet to find out about, then book a stay for, intensive marriage therapy. A first disgruntled Arnold refuses although does end up in Maine along with Kay.

The small town is lovely, atmospheric as it is by the water, quaint and really a place that most would love to visit. Kay immediately thought how great it was to be there while Arnold thought it over-priced, one positive and one negative as they start their sessions with Dr. Feld.

What is so interesting about therapy with these actors, is that it is all done unrehearsed. Director David Frankel usually chooses to take the first cut. Causing it to go in this direction provides the viewers with seeing; very personal reactions, facial surprises, uncomfortable movements, candid speaking, outbursts and all the rawness of being vulnerable without a filter.

While Kay is constantly pulling and fiddling around with the buttons on her cardigan, Arnold is grimacing and staring down Dr. Feld. The tension is perfectly palpable as the couple is learning all about each other all over again, and that things just have to change.

This intensely personal look into marriage on the inside is a great opportunity to learn a few things for yourself. A brilliant and slightly comedic drama, more for adults who can see the reasons why some just refuse to give up.",1357344000,4,2128,4.897222222222222

Jones' character is something of a bully and resists almost all efforts to change things until the very end -- which is not completely convincing.  Streep is her own brilliant self completely inhabiting the character of a wife who wants to please, but needs a little more from life.  She moved this old widow almost to tears at moments. Not your choice if you are looking for excitement and adventure, but a piercing look at what you don't want your marriage to become.",1357257600,,644,4.62280701754386

I thought Hope Springs looked like a cute, funny movie about a husband and wife falling in love again.  And maybe it was - but I sure didn't get that far.  I think my husband and I made it about 25 minutes into the movie before turning it off.  I don't really care to watch random people ""exploring themselves"" or learning how to give their husbands oral sex.

One thing is for sure - Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep do a great job at acting uncomfortable.  Although they probably didn't HAVE to act during those scenes.  Yikes.

How do movies like this get made? Think of the number of hands scripts must pass before they get the green light. How did this become a movie?!

I physically felt ill for these two actors in some scenes. Surely they knew it was a flop, but being the consummate pros they are, the only thing to do is make the best of it. I can just hear them thinking, ""The wrap will come. Just keep going.""

The one saving grace here is that Connecticut has some beautiful charming towns. If only this had been a documentary about those towns---THAT would have been enjoyable.

However, the movie, simply stated, was filthy.  It starts out with an older couple, Streep and Jones, with a dull, lifeless marriage.  Streep wants some life back in her marriage and signs them up for a weekend of intensive marriage counseling.

I thought it lagged in some parts; not sure why they needed the bar scene, maybe just to showcase Elizbeth Shue for 2 minutes.

The first film I recall actively presenting this was 'Failure to Launch' with Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, another great screen couple that have terrific chemistry, much like TLJ and MS in this film.
I didn't have high hopes for the film as I am not a huge Steve Carroll fan, but loved him in this film.  As big of a TLJ that I am, SC and MS really are the ones who nailed this film for me.",1357084800,,810,4.2064516129032254

5279469,4,B0099116AY,"If you're looking for a comedy, this is not it.  This is about real life for the middle aged... in this case a married couple caught in the boring humdrum routine their lives have become.  I enjoyed this movie - but I had to take breaks during watching it to break up the glumness of the movie.  There were scenes that were very funny, and others that were sad.  I liked that the end didn't leave me hanging and there was a good outcome.  Steve Carell in a non-comedic role was a big surprise and he pulled it off perfect.  I don't think this movie is appropriate for young kids, or even teens.  It's a movie for mature adults and those who can handle the truth, and need a lesson about what life can become if you don't do something about it.",1356912000,,743,4.190140845070423

5279473,4,B0099116AY,Definitely more appealing for the older generation. Shows how easily a good marriage can go wrong. I found it interesting and fun to watch.,1356912000,,139,4.833333333333333
5279474,3,B0099116AY,"This was a good movie up until the highly Hollywood end.  The acting was good, the story line made sense.  I laughed, I sympathised.  I was rooting for them all the way.  But no one changes a marriage in a week. I would have been happy with the hope that these people were on their way to figuring it out.  I really didn't need the perfect ending, which just undermined the credibility of the whole movie.  And the scene during the credits was plain embarassing. This movie was aimed at adults. We really don't need to be clobbered over the head- we get it- it worked out!  All that said, the movie is worth seeing.  It addresses real issues with humor and heart.",1356912000,,663,4.333333333333333

5279477,4,B0099116AY,Realistic storyline. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep VERY believable. My sister and I watched this and discussed the parallels in our own relationships. Could be a great conversation starter if you could actually get a man to watch it. Better chances to watch as a rental. It did inspire hope for exploring reconnection with a spouse and bringing back the spark.,1356912000,,363,4.870967741935484

5279484,5,B0099116AY,"My husband and I have been married for 42 years, so we could relate to some of the relationship issues.  Although we are not as far apart as this couple, we definitely enjoyed watching it.

5279486,5,B0099116AY,"I think you definitely have to be older to appreciate this movie.  There were several times when I found myself laughing at loud uncontrollably.  It's well acted, and it's nice to see a movie with substance rather than a movie where an actresses sex appeal, cleavage, and butt are suppose to carry the story....although - I thought both Streep and Jones were sexy for their age!",1356825600,,378,4.712121212121212

5279490,3,B0099116AY,Very slow and depressing.  I expected some humor considering the cast.  Not much was solved and then all of a sudden at the end they were okay.,1356825600,,143,4.2592592592592595

5279493,4,B0099116AY,As a therapist I found this very funny and several laugh out loud.  All great actors at their best.  Wnjoy,1356825600,,106,4.25
5279494,4,B0099116AY,"I gave this move 4 stars because had I been able to rate aspects of the movie separately the average would have been 4.  I am a fan of M Streep and I would have given her 10 stars.  I see all of her movies because I think she has an amazing capacity to act and I love to watch her take on the various personas.  Some who we celebrate as 'great' simply play themselves or a variation of themselves in a changing array of settings.  In the past three years we have seen her go from nun to Prada-diva to Greek Island middle-aged hottie, to ageless chef to the iron lady and I may have forgotten a couple.

In this less than complicated plot we see Meryl capturing the look and emotion of an empty-nested housewife whose husband has retreated into a deep cave lined with golf tip movies, newspapers and mechanical movements.  We learn later that both are responsible for the frigid status of their marriage, but here we see Meryl accurately portray the middle-aged woman who though embarrassed and vulnerable, haltingly and bravely takes steps to mitigate the situation.  Through the nuances of the relationship, Meryl, with believable depictions allows us to know how someone in this situation would feel.

Steve Carell was remarkably believable as a therapist and Tommy Lee Jones played the angry curmudgeon he seems to know so well.  The plot was simple but realistic and the scenic shots were kind to the eye.

And, there were no explosions, no pictures of bloody carnage, no chase scenes, no leaps from airplanes with or without benefit of parachute. Not a single shot was fired!  Absent ""action"" our attention as viewers was held rather through human interaction.  How novel!",1356825600,2,1677,4.686006825938566
5279495,3,B0099116AY,Sort of an over the top version of a dysfunctional marriage after 31 years.  Acting is OK with three big name stars.  Glad I did not pay $8-10 dollars to see it.  Saw it with another couple and it was probably worth the $1.99 rental fee.,1356825600,,237,4.108695652173913
5279496,2,B0099116AY,"The guy is pits. In the end, he gets better, but still not a family movie.  Im would consider it for good acting.",1356825600,,113,3.9130434782608696
5279497,4,B0099116AY,Definitely not a comedy although there are funny momemts. The performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were incredible - spot on in my opinion. Steve Carrell did well in a serious role. Really enjoyed it.,1356825600,,214,4.8108108108108105
5279498,5,B0099116AY,"With such a terrific cast, it could only be terrific; therefore, I deem it a wwonderful BluRay smash hit!  There were more than ten words stated at ""smash hit"", yet ""one more word"" was required.  No more reviews!",1356825600,,212,4.552631578947368
5279499,4,B0099116AY,"This movie was not at all what I expected but I enjoyed it none the less. The storyline was interesting and very true to life. It was sad but I have seen this happen to couples who have been married a long time. The problems they discussed are probably the top 2 in most marriages. The acting was terrific and there were some very funny parts.

I don't suggest you watch it with anyone younger than 18 though. The subject line was for a mature audience and it is not as funny as the trailer leads you to believe.",1356825600,,512,4.171717171717172

5279503,5,B0099116AY,Husband and wife in a mid life marriage crisis could have turned out to be a terribly boring comedy. I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. But I found it delightful. I even had belly laughs.,1356825600,,191,4.333333333333333
5279504,2,B0099116AY,"Some of my favorite actors, but the script was not good and stereotypical.  Sad waste of brilliant actors.  Hollywood needs to regroup and start making some quality films.",1356739200,,171,5.071428571428571

5279506,3,B0099116AY,"The acting was pretty much flawless in this picture, although it was one of the few times when I felt that Meryl Streep was not 100% convincing in a role.  She was only about 98% convincing.",1356739200,,190,4.277777777777778

5279508,1,B0099116AY,"Disappointing & not funny like the previews show.  Meryl Streep is always an excellent actress, but this script wasn't consistent in the story line & did her no justice.  Seemed awkward & the ending confusing...what the what?",1356739200,2,225,5.054054054054054
5279509,5,B0099116AY,This movie hit home.  So close to my heart where the issue of feeling alone when you are together.  I saw myself and my husband in both of these characters many times through this movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone thinking divorce or the other side of the fence is greener!,1356739200,,287,4.377358490566038

5279511,4,B0099116AY,"You can't miss with two great actors like Streep and Jones. This is a sweet movie about marriage and the changes couples go through until... Well, I won't reveal the ending. Carel is wonderful as the marriage counselor. Don't expect his usual kind of role, however. I think a lot of couples will see themselves in these performances.",1356739200,,333,4.758620689655173
5279512,2,B0099116AY,"I was expecting more of comedy from the previews, perhaps along the line of ""Somethings Gotta Give"", with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton.  Especially that this movie had Steve Carell in it, The story line was not bad in itself, but it was more serious, about an aging couple with relationship issues.  It was more of a Lifetime show, not something I would pay to go see or rent (like I did).  There were a couple of parts in it I didn't need to see.",1356739200,,450,4.270588235294118

5279551,1,B0099116AY,"The previews of this movie on television made it look like a romantic comedy, which my wife and I both enjoy, but after ordering and watching it we realized it was a very heavy handed and cumbersome drama.

All the cast members are fantastic actors! Hope Springs should have been an Oscar candidate with this powerful cast, but this show is a total flop. The cast, I believe did the best job that they could with what they had, but the script stunk on ice. It was not at all enjoyable to watch.

I used to think that Fargo was the biggest waste of film, and the worst movie I'd ever seen, but Hope Springs out bombed it by a mile, and then some!

My advice is don't waste you money on this DVD, but if you did, do what I'm going to do, use it for skeet shooting. It would make a much better clay pigeon than a movie.",1356480000,3,816,4.0875

They're very proper and traditional and don't talk about sex the way they are forced to during the therapy sessions.  It reminded me that at every age there are relationship struggles.

5279588,2,B0099116AY,"PG-13? - Over the edge - Basically Porn - Should be rated R
This movie is totally inappropriate for children/teenagers of any age.

It also misses the point.  One of the main purposes of sex within marriage (between a man and a woman) is to communicate love, acceptance, safety, and security to a deeper level.  If sex within marriage degrades either the man or the woman, it is defeating the purpose and the person feels used by the other.

I am glad they talk about their needs.  This is healthy.  I am also glad they take the chance to open up and re-kindle their romance.  Romance is great and more than just the sex.  I am also glad they are married in this movie.  Study after Study documents that sex outside of Marriage leads to many downstream problems as well as decreased satisfaction with sex within Marriage later.

I rated it 2 stars (I don't like it) because it does have a couple of redeeming features but overall, I wish I hadn't watched it.
I should have looked at pluggedinonline.com at the review first.

5279590,3,B0099116AY,My wife and I wanted to watch a light-hearted movie about marriage and this was not it for us.  Most of the movie was spent focusing on a severely dysfunctional marriage and a couple's attempt to repair it.  Only in the last 15 minutes or so do you get to the feel good part.  I think that the movie was a serious drama and that it raised some  issues about problems that can arise in marriages.  The image / poster for the movie gives the impression that it is more of a comedy and that I why I was disappointed.,1356307200,7,513,4.09

5279594,2,B0099116AY,"As charming as these actors are, and they are engaging, the script feels like it was written by a young person who thinks all relationships succeed or fail based on how much sex everyone is having. (Maybe that's true, but I'm sick of those story-lines).  There's a fair amount of Hollywood drivel in this movie.  I had assumed these actors would have enough clout to do a realistic movie about marriage at that age.  Either they don't have that clout or, in real life, they are not nearly as deep as we like to think them.  My guess is this movie died by a thousand cuts of compromise and integrity.",1356307200,10,599,4.418181818181818

Streep as versatile as ever, shines with her very nuance and movement (she even plays with herself in a self-satisfying scene). Tommy Lee Jones, pensive and often a whiny andropausal man, creates believable tension between them, a couple married for 30-odd years but feeling loveless. Steve Carell is decent but can't shake off his comedic streak. At times, the movie touches a nerve or two and makes you feel, but other times, it was just long conversations and the focus is on the two great stars' acting.",1356134400,,639,4.871559633027523

5279617,1,B0099116AY,"First, let me say that this is not a movie I would be drawn to rent or buy.  That being said, I checked this film out at my local library thinking it might be entertaining.  Boy was I wrong!  Most of this film is devoted to Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones' characters exploring intimacy with one another to salvage their marriage that's in the dumps.  I can't begin to express how uncomfortable I was in seeing these aging stars try to develop chemistry with one another.

We stayed hoping for more but got nothing out of it in the end. I don't suggest buying it.  Go the one-time rental route if you feel you must, but buying it would be a waste, as I'm pretty sure you would not want to sit through it more than once and torture yourself.

They're a middle-aged couple who have been married for thirty years, but for the last five years have slept in separate bedrooms and haven't made love during this time. Kay is very unhappy about the situation and wants it to change, so she browses through a bookstore and finds a book written by Dr. Feld, played by Steve Carell (who is great in this movie, not over the top like he sometimes can be), about restoring marriage and enjoying being in a good relationship. So Kay books them on a week long retreat run by Dr. Feld. The movie is touching and funny, it's a movie for women and men. It will be thoroughly enjoyed by married couples. The supporting characters are great as well especially Jean Smart who plays, Eileen, Kay's best friend and Elizabeth Shue who plays Karen the Bartender. It is hilarious when Kay is in the bar because she and Arnold just had words and she spills that she and Arnold haven't had sex in five years; Karen's response is wonderful and funny!",1355875200,,1152,4.543269230769231

Still, I had a very hard time (as someone much younger than the protangonists) watching the ""love scenes.""

Both lead roles became characatures rather than the characters they should have been. In particular, Tommy Lee Jones was such a cliche' of a distant husband that he was practically a cartoon.

Possibly the most frustrating aspect of this movie was its failure to contect the dots between the two totally alienated people that awkwardly stumbled through counseling, and the two love birds passionately sharing a Kodak moment on beach at the end.  80% of this film depicted a disaffected couple heading for divorce, and then it rushed to wrap things up in a bow and send the viewers home happy.

What a shame.",1355529600,,807,4.702127659574468

For their 31st anniversary, they gave each other the extended cable package! The woman wants the passion they had in the beginning so she forces her husband to attend a week long marriage counseling session. The husband has no interest but goes along complaining every step of the way. Then, just as we expect, he has a change in heart and they live happily ever after.

Many of the named supporting actors in the cast are also accomplished and skillful but the story is predictable and shallow.

Otherwise, you see Tommy Lee Jones as you never want to see him again--as a boring accountant with no romance. The epilogue to the movie showed  him happy, loving, and full of life but we never get to see him make the transformation.

Steve Carrell is boring as the marriage counselor. Meryl is Meryl as a 50-year old old maid who happens to be married to Jones and cooks him bacon and eggs every morning. In the highlight of the show, she can't bring herself to perform oral sex on Jones in a theatre, and Jones runs after her telling her that it is no big deal.

About a third of the movie takes place in the office of the therapist, with Steve Carell in the utterly miscast role. These scenes alternated between cringingly embarrassing and snoozingly boring.

Meryl Streep was terrible in the role, and Tommy Lee Jones was really hard to look at. Watching them pretending to try to have sex was just painful!!!

An older couple falling in love. I understood the story was an older married couple re-igniting their love. What I got was 100 minutes of sadness and depression and a story about a husband who doesn't give a rats behind about his wife and a miserable wife who can't speak up for what she wants and THEN the agony of Steve Carrell trying to drag out the details of their sex life, favorite positions, favorite sexual acts. At one point his advice to them is for her to perform oral sex on him in the movie theater. I would have turned it off except we were watching it with friends at their house and I think no one wanted to be the first to say they hated it, since I was the one who picked it out at the video store. My video renting priviledges have been revoked according to my husband for picking this movie. LOL! The ONLY saving grace was that it did have a happy ending, but you don't know that until just before the credits roll. Seriously, the only light hearted moments are shown in the trailer which is seriously misleading about this movie.

So, in conclusion, don't waste your time or money. It's not a feel good kind of movie that leaves you happy and optomistic of life and love and especially about marriage.",1355097600,4,1490,4.8893280632411065

The first 20 minutes or so of the film are very depressing, followed by a slightly less depressing middle part of the film, and more depression towards the end, with one bright moment in the last 5 minutes of the film (part of which plays during the credits).  Steve Carrell plays his part solidly, and Tommy Lee Jones nails his character- but unfortunately his character was written as more of a drasticly exaggerated charicature of a grumpy old male spouse, rather than  realistic one.  If you're 50 years old or older, you may get some mindless enjoyment out of this film for what it is (and this is the demographic it was really written for), but it lacks in many areas and isn't very enjoyable for anyone younger than that.",1355097600,2,839,4.573333333333333

The scene in the hotel room when he looks at her and stops---- what was that?  That just really muddied things up with no later resolution.

It seemed ALL they talked about was sex (their counselor mostly) and the actors were afraid to speak of it....that's about the gist of the movie.  No plot, no storyline, not much comedy...just awkward dialog between them.  I also kept looking to see how much of the movie was left...hoping there was time to redeem it...nope, it didn't.  Would I watch this again?  NO!!!!  I could write a lot more here about what was wrong with this movie....but I think just saying in my opinion it was BAD is enough.  I now wish I had rented ""We Bought A Zoo"" with Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson and Colin Ford.  At least it has a good storyline AND comedy....I've been told.

When I realized that it was more of a ""dramedy"", I felt like I was on a rollercoaster of not being sure that I should laugh, scowl or cry.  But don't let my impressions hinder you - I highly recommend this movie and see it more than once.  It is so touching, poignant, painful and funny that it should be shoe-in Oscar nominations for Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep both. You will feel your heart move.  (And Steve Carrel should be nominated for best supporting actor, he's absolutely excellent as the therapist.)

Overall, the movie took me back to the time in my life when I was 16 and my parents separated for the very reason that Meryl begins questioning her own marriage: Married too young, kids too soon, then wondering ""what the hell"" when the kids were gone and she's found looking back at her life and trying to find meaning.  The movie was an incredibly accurate journey of what I can now see what my parents must have gone through, the pain, angst, love and loyalty that gets all jumbled up then one person ""upsets the apple cart.""  I'm pleased to also share that when Dad passed away last year, Mom and Dad had just celebrated their 57th wedding anniversary.

5279796,5,B0099116AY,"First, the talent in these two actors shines, their performances are perfect in this movie. It's not often I find a movie about which I have no criticism, not even the tiniest, but this is one. I also only give 5 stars to my all-time favorite movies, and I was surprised that a movie like this made the cut, as I usually categorize this type as a 3...4, tops.

I think it is a movie for men, as well as women, though I wonder if the men would rather watch it alone, without their significant other, in order to avoid allowing them to see them get emotional, which undoubtedly some men will. The movie describes the frailties of men's emotions, which are too often covered up by the tough exterior expected - no, required - by society. The pressure of this idea is palpable. Though he goes down with a fight worthy to become legendary, to the end, he is eventually forced to make a choice between exposing his long-supressed hurts and fears and losing what he loves the most. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greats and his golden performance here is not to be missed.

Meryl Streep delivers as gloriously and subtly and funnily and fragilely and strongly and crushingly as one would expect from her. The burden of Tommy's character is shared by Meryl's, as well, as she must face her own failings and insecurities and make a life-altering decision.

It becomes established in this movie that the unusually versatile Steve Carell is a force to be reckoned with in drama. Any naysayers will now silence themselves. No one but Clint Eastwood comes to mind offhand, though I know there are others, who can say so much with so few words as Steve did in this performance.

It's Tommy's character who touches me most, though, even though I am female and one might think I would be most moved by the problems of my own gender. There's just something about seeing a rare glimpse of mushiness come begrudgingly from a strong, stern, manly man, that really melts me. Ah well, so now you know my weakness. This movie has made me give away my secrets, too.",1354838400,,2040,4.505405405405406

Rather than eliciting sympathy, empathy, or general feelings of tenderness towards Streep's character, Kay, and her plight, Kay's one dimensional meekness elicited nothing but irritation.  And what was the deal with Arnold?  Did I miss something or did he never reveal why he became a stodgy, complaining, dissatisfied grouch?  Steve Carell's performance as the warm and caring Dr. Feld was the one saving grace of the movie.  Even that isn't reason enough to watch it.  Sadly, I can not recommend this dud.",1354838400,,647,5.095238095238095
5279799,3,B0099116AY,"While HOPE SPRINGS wants to congratulate itself for examining the stagnation of a 31 year marriage, it is actually a movie about a disillusioned couple avoiding sex.  90% of the film has Kaye and Arnold discussing why they don't have sex anymore or what they can do to bring sex back to their union.  Which is all well and good, but where does love fit into the equation.  Not once do they say ""We don't make love anymore"" or ""Let's make love"".  It's this ultimate tunnel vision which ultimately left me cold.  Is there love without sex?  Sex without love?  The script never clearly delineates exactly why Arnold is reluctant to show physical attention to the needy Kaye.
Even so, one can't help getting involved and that's due to the superb performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Streep has rarely been so restrained.  No real showy histrionic scenes.  None of her usual OMG moments.  Yet she is marvelous as always.  Her command of who Kaye really is enables us to identify and feel for her.  Jones is equally effective as the husband who feels the longevity of their marriage supports his idea of a successful relationship.  Steve Carell's turn as the wise marriage therapist is a nice change of pace for the usually manic performer.  I liked Elisabeth Shue's brief but comfortable appearabce as a witty bartender.
HOPE SPRINGS is a ""nice"" movie, but not a great one.  Instead of watching two people fall in love all over again, we see two people have sex.",1354838400,,1473,4.673151750972763

Within 5 minutes I was choking up.  Don't get me wrong, there are times of absolute hilarity, the audience was roaring with laughter at a lot of scenes.  However, it just struck me as a more realistic portrayal of life. Honest.  Everyone's hopes, dreams, wishes.....and the inevitable feeling of those dreams drifting away.  But then resulting in a journey of acceptance and love. For me it was an emotional kick in the gut. Maybe that's just me.  But this film made me a blubbering idiot.  If you have parents that are getting up there in age, and you are feeling this creeping up on yourself as well, fair warning. Do not let this film bypass you. Meryl Streep tore at my heart. Amazing, seemingly effortless work by her. Yes, her again.  For those who criticize her work as being too, for lack of a better word, ""studied"" or ""educated"", you can throw that out the window with this. Just her facial expressions killed me, no words, just an everyday person's feelings flowing across her face. So realistic.  Tommy Lee Jones---hilarious, heartbreaking, a performance that was every bit as realistic.  He was awesome.  Even though I had tears running down my face practically the entire time, I'm getting this DVD.

This was dreadful, and surprisingly so given you have such a great actress and actor in the lead roles.  Why in the world would Streep and Tommy Lee ever agree to do this drivel?  The only redeeming quality to the movie is that they are indeed really good.  The rest is for the garbage.

The story idea seems interesting, perhaps poignant, perhaps funny?  Oops, no.  The poor unhappy wife who wants a ""real marriage"" again, you know, where they actually enjoy each other's company, where they really talk and have fun.  The unpleasant, equally unhappy husband doesn't want anything to change and fights her tooth and nail at her suggestion they go to marriage counselling.  Alas, he gives in and the rest of the movie is about...............SEX.  Yep, sex.  What they want, what they don't want, what they fantasize about, how to perform certain sex acts, on and on.

Apparently, somewhere along the way, the writer/director forgot that what the wife wanted was a ""real marriage"" again with fun, talking, enjoyment and friendship.  Truly, this is insulting to your intelligence and sense of decency.  This movie is so 2012, it's pathetic.  When in doubt of how to make a good movie, make it all about sex.

Perhaps this would appeal to teenagers, except I wouldn't let my teenager see it for it's non-stop references to sex.  And the overarching message that a marriage is all about sex.",1354752000,5,1464,4.768924302788845

5279810,4,B0099116AY,"Hope Springs(released Aug/12)is a tour de force character study/performance starring Meryl Streep as Kay Soames,Tommy Lee Jones as Arnold Soames,Steve Carell as Dr. Bernie Feld,Elisabeth Shue as Karen and others. Streep,Jones and Carell are the mainstays of this picture,which,as Mary Poppins would say,is practically perfect in every way. The film is definitely geared to an older demographic,so don't show this one to the kids as it does have some very adult themes in it. But children of the age group portrayed,might also see something in it either of themselves(as in maybe what's to come if...) or their relatives.
The story finds Streep and Jones as wife and husband,married for 31 years. Their marriage,to put it mildly,is in a funk. Jones has settled into his daily routine while Streep has come to the realization that she wants more of what the couple used to have,as far as their relationship and intimacy goes. Streep finds a book written by a therapist,who happens to also run a marriage clinic in a remote town in Maine(Carell).Streep of her own accord and without warning,pays for the $4,000 trip there,and hands Jones the tickets for the plane. He is adamantly opposed to it and vows to stay home. Come the morning of the flight Streep is off by herself to the airport and onto the plane. Just as it looks like she is really going solo,Jones appears and off they fly.
The town is quaint and rustic but Jones is constantly complaining of how much everything is costing. They have their first meeting with Carell who is super professional,patient and understanding. Jones however is not very cooperative at all.
The sessions go step by step,as the two try to overcome years of emotional and physical baggage. For every step forward,there seems to be one or two back. Jones is seemingly the bad guy up to a point,but we find out Streep also has alot to do with what has gone on in their marriage and relationship(it is a two way street after all).When the two get to,as the doctor describes it,""the one yard line"",a disagreement/let down almost threatens to derail the entire process. They stay the course,but the two never successfully and completely turn things around,and they end up returning home with things,sadly,back almost to square one. Streep is ready to call the marriage quits,as she actually gets packed and ready to leave. That night Jones enters her room and closes the door behind him;totally out of character(yes,they sleep in separate bedrooms).The thought of Jones losing his wife finally melts away his stubborn pride and the two finally begin their long journey back to regaining what they had lost.
The film ends,and the credits roll,as Carell is presiding over the two's recommitting of their marriage vows on a beach(as per Streep's wishes).Very romantic.
Watching Streep and Jones playing an average married couple(their on screen chemistry was amazing,as was their underacting!),and who talk through the cause and effects their specific marital problems have had on them and their marriage,is an absolute delight. Also Carell plays the eternally calm and pleasant therapist on whose words hangs the balance of the Soames marriage,and I give high kudos to him for his wonderful portrayal. This is definitely a movie geared for the baby boomers out there and as such,in some big or small aspect,should touch a nerve with about every one of them. For a blooper,keep an eye on Jones when during the first session where he finally opens up about his sexuality,he does a couch scooching. In one shot he's at the far end of the couch the pair sit on,the next he is in the middle,then it's back to the end again. As a matter of fact the entire couch sitting routine is something else. Streep always,unless alone,sits on the right side. Through out the sessions,and depending on how well they are going,Jones goes from the opposite end,to the middle,back,all the way beside Streep,and then back to the end. This coupled with their body language are little things that really help put the film over.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary, a gag reel,a featurette and alternate takes.
All in all a wonderfully done look at the coming apart and restoring of a 31 years marriage gone wrong. It's like getting your own private therapy session,or being the bug on a wall at a real one. The threesome of Carell,Jones and Streep are simply outstanding. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1354579200,5,4461,4.9256308100929616

5279817,4,B0099116AY,"In August 2012, a new comedy titled ""Hope Springs"" from David Frankel (director of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Marley and Me"") was released in theaters.

Written by Vanessa Taylor (""Alias"", ""Gideon's Crossing"") and starring Meryl Streep (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""Doubt"", ""Adaptation""), Tommy Lee Jones (""No Country For Old Men"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Men in Black"" films), Steve Carell (""The Office"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""Crazy Stupid Love""), Jean Smart (""Designing Women"", ""Graden State""), Elisabeth Shue (""Back to the Future"" films, ""Leaving Las Vegas""), Ben Rappaport (""Outsourced"", ""The Brass Teapot"") and Marin Ireland (""I Am Legend"", ""Revolutionary Road"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"").

Receiving positive reviews for the performances by Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell, ""Hope Springs"" did well in the box office (considering the summer blockbuster competition) as the film budgeted at $30 million would go on to earn over $104,000.

JUDGMENT CALL:

An enjoyable comedy with a storyline that should have been made long ago.

""Hope Springs"" is a storyline that many older adults can relate to. It's one thing to be in love and grow old with your partner, but how does one keep the passion strong and alive?

I don't know how many couples I have known that are like the characters Arnold and Kaye.  Couples who are devoted with one another, but somehow intimacy has decreased a lot as the years go by.

As I get older, I find it fascinating how conversation with my friends have changed when it comes to relationship topics when we were in our 20s and then in our 30s and now in our 40s and some friends who are in their 50s or 60s.  There are many men and women who simply give up the intimacy and when I hear from guys who get all bummed out when they tell me they had not had any sexual intimacy with their wife in years, suffice to say, it's sad to hear that older couples just give up the intimacy or no longer into it.

So, for years, I have always wondered when a film would be created on the subject.  We always see movies about the new couple who have children and lose intimacy but what about the older couples?

Yes, I understand that Hollywood doesn't focus on older couples as much anymore.  When I really think about it, the films that have explored it took place back in the '90s with films such as ""Father of the Bride 2 which starred Steve Martin and his wife who is older but is expecting a baby, along with her daughter who is also about to give birth.

But there aren't any films that tackle on intimacy.  And maybe it's because it's something that many Americans face when they get older and some may consider it a depressing topic because perhaps intimacy for many couples don't exist or are as not as strong when one gets older.

That's why I really enjoyed ""Hope Springs"" and its message of how couples, no matter how great their marriage is, both need to try and become intimate.  It's one thing to hug and to hold but open communication about one's needs in a relationship, no matter what age you are, is important.

And the performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep feel natural.  Arnold is a man who is uncomfortable discussing his sexual fantasies or problems with a doctor, while Kaye feels this is the only way she can get her husband to be intimate by bringing in professional help.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and to see both she and Tommy Lee Jones having fun in the film, not only was it fun to watch but I found myself hoping that many other couples who have lost that spark, maybe will try to regain it with their loved one right after watching this film!  It's quite inspiring and definitely a film that just makes you feel good because it is a film about relationships but also hope despite the problems a married (or unmarried) couple may have despite the many decades they have been together.

Along with Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, the performance by Steve Carell was also rather fascinating.  No comedy role or weird facial gestures, Carell plays the straight up Dr. Feld and is intent in helping this couple achieve true intimacy.  It's possibly the most serious role I have seen Carell be part of and it's great to see him trying something different and not be the actual funny man of the film.

As for the DVD, as mentioned in my review, while PQ and AQ are good on DVD, for those wanting the best picture quality and lossless audio, will definitely want to watch this film on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD does look and sounds good and also includes special features such as audio commentary, gag reel, interviews with Streep and Jones plus a featurette with alternate scenes.

An enjoyable, fun, mature comedy for adults and ""Hope Springs"" is a film long overdue.  Also, a film featuring fantastic, believable and heartwarming performances by Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Recommended!",1354320000,,6550,4.778666666666667

5279820,5,B0099116AY,"In the first 10 minute of the film, you have established character with your two major actors. This is what a movie is supposed to do. It was refreshing to witness actors, director, and screen writer all come together in a professional manner. The only reason I mention this is because too many films out there are having trouble with this. These guys made it look easy.

Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) and Kay (Meryl Streep) have been married for 31 years. They are in a routine which most of us call ""a rut."" Kay opts to save the marriage, one that Arnold is unaware is in trouble, by going to a marriage counselor played by an unfunny Steven Carrell. Arnold hates the idea, and reluctantly goes with.

The movie takes place in the quaint Maine coastal town of Norwalk, Conn. It is a feel good movie that has its ups and downs. The comedy, plot, and drama are light in order to generate a feeling. The film was done extremely well, one that I would say was worthy of Oscar nomination, but not necessarily winning. I will also add, it really wasn't my cup of tea, but I can't fault the film. I had to keep reminding myself Tommy Lee Jones was not named ""Kay"" in this film as he was in three previous pictures (MIB Agent K).

Mimi Rogers, who is mentioned in the credits, is on screen for about 10 seconds near the end.

Parental Guide: No nudity or F-bombs. The language is somewhat PG. There are sex scenes, including oral where everyone is fully clothed. The sex talk uses PG type language i.e. ""oral sex"" as opposed to ""BJ.""",1353888000,,1522,4.386524822695035
5279821,4,B0099116AY,"A college teaching assistant feels his dopamine levels go through the roof when he meets a beautiful woman taking one of his classes.  Perhaps she also feels hopeful in marrying an older wiser man?  But very shortly after getting married, a three decade long disappointment ensues for Arnold and Kay since getting married for chemistry can only last so long.  With Kay's encouragement they visit a third person to help them out.  A few tips for couples (ie: no name calling, it's okay to be playful, etc) get them started and in the end, they grow to develop a peaceful love relationship although how they really got there perhaps could have used a little more clarity.  I assume that after the retreat they continue their therapy and when Arnold's work friend tells him how he had lost his wife by habitually treating her in an ungrateful way, Arnold comes around to see himself and his wife as imperfect human beings in need of human love.

I think it's great that this movie got made because I imagine it could help some couples to rekindle their relationship in a more satisfying way.  It seems to be sending out a very clear message:  It's okay to, and there's no shame in, working with a specialist in marital dynamics.",1353542400,,1225,4.638888888888889
5279822,4,B0099116AY,"""Easy with the teeth!"" pops out of my husband's mouth even when we are cooking dinner... When he says this we crack up because of the incredibly sweet, entertaining Hope Springs!

I have always been a fan of Meryl Streep and my husband, Joe Bob LOVES Tommy Lee Jones, especially since TLJ is from a small West Texas town near us....**only in Texas are men regularly referred to by 2 names**

So off we go with friends who are older than us...apparently things are NOT happening in their bedroom either because they were patting each other and having an apologetic conversation with their eyes!  Point being:  It was as fun watching the audience as it was watching the talented cast...

I will say, we have been happily married for 30 years and really can't relate to this movie except for the fact that our grandparents ALL slept in separate beds; therefore, we deduced that THEY had the same problems....  TLJ and MS probably should have portrayed a couple married 40 years...  We are early 50's and they are both a good 10 years older than we are...This is why I gave the movie 4****s instead of 5.

Otherwise, I recommend this movie to ALL married couples, regardless of age!  Who knows...maybe this is all the ""therapy"" they will ever need.  Isn't it true that prevention is the best medicine??!!",1353196800,4,1300,4.637554585152839
5279823,2,B0099116AY,"This movie could have been so much better. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a fine job portraying believable middle-aged characters along with Steve Carrell playing a sympathetic counselor. As far as an empty marriage requiring a 180 degree change, it was a believable plot line until their therapy only involved sex work with some really stupid juvenile tips that will bring on cringe-inducing moments. Rather than make a movie for 'grown ups', this production devolved into yet ANOTHER story built around SEX. Very tiresome when this had makings of greatness and could've been 90 minutes of marital counseling for the masses but instead was built around teenage fantasies for old people and how to rekindle sex at age 60 like an 18 year old. More gross than funny, let me tell you!",1352764800,34,787,4.880597014925373
5279824,5,B0099116AY,"Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I went to see this movie with my mom and she was freaking out and covering my eyes in some parts, I thought it was funny and that she was overreacting.  After the movie I had to remind her that I am fourteen.  This movie is about a married couple of thirty-one years, Kay (played by Merryl Streep) and Arnold (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who love each other so much, but have not been affectionate or intimate with each other in many years.  They even sleep in separate rooms, and on anniversaries they get gifts not for each other, but for the house.  Kay gets sad at the reality that she and her husband do not have a real relationship.  So she gets a book about marriage and calls the couple's counselor and schedules the intense therapy to fix her marriage.  At first Arnold refuses to go, but then reconsiders when Kate leaves without him, then reluctantly he goes with her because he does not want to lose her.  All throughout the movie Arnold is uncomfortable with therapy, and especially the intimate tasks assigned by Dr. Fields (played by Steve Carrell).  While Kay really wants to have a ""real"" relationship, Arnold is tentative and they battle with this throughout the whole movie.  This movie was very sweet in a weird way because it is based around an older and very in love couple that struggles with intimacy and I guess for a young audience, that visual would gross them out.  The soundtrack in this movie reminded me of music in a silent film because music is included in most scenes and they describe the scene, even if the words are not there.  Tommy Lee Jones is very versatile as an actor.  I have never seen him play a domestic character or anyone in a relationship, it is refreshing and he does a great job.  This movie makes me see the power in love and determination to sustain it.  My mother was shocked by some scenes but then laughed, so this would be a great movie for couples who are in a long relationship.  This is a very intriguing movie, I have not seen many with this concept, so I give it five out of five stars.  I recommend this movie for mature 13-year-olds and up. This is a good movie for a mature crowd.

5279825,4,B0099116AY,"Streep and Jones play a well-settled couple, empty-nesters after 31 years of marriage. The two have fallen into a rut, but Streep's character wants their marriage to have a future to look forward to - not just more of the same. So she drags him, fighting every inch of the way, to some high-intensity couples counseling. It's hardly a spoiler to say there's a happyu ending.

To tell the truth, I'm not much o fa ""relationships movie"" kind of guy, and the whole counseling thing doesn't do much for me. But, against all reason, I really liked this one. Streep and Jones are masters of their art, at the top of their form. They play out the ennui, frustration, claustrophobia, and renewal in utterly believable ways. Likewise, the nervous moments with the shrink, especially when it turns to their intimate lives (or lack thereof). One of the best moments came when Carrel's Dr. Feld brought up oral sex, including the possibility of her as a receiver as well as giver. Streep seemed utterly convincing as the prim, inhibited wife who'd never even imagined the possibility.

Truly the best part, though, was seeing it with my own Best Beloved, shring groanable moments with her of the form ""I'm so glad we're not like THAT."" (Full disclosure: I've been with the same lady for 28 years, as of this writing.) And, I have to admit, we both walked out just a little more eager to please the other. Since most of the others in the theater with us seemed to be couples well past their youth, as we were, I'd venture the guess that we weren't alone in that. This gets top marks, earned equally by Streep and Jones, for bringing real life to life.

5279826,5,B0099116AY,"It seems that Amazon is up to their usual tricks with reviews of this item posted before the item even exists for purchase.  Of course that makes it impossible for any reviewer to properly review the item that will actually be sold since those items are NOT. YET. AVAILABLE. for purchase or review.  Please take that into consideration if you see a bunch of reviews of this item and if you really want to know if the Blu-ray or DVD is worth spending your money on, then please read carefully and find reviews here that tell you about specifics of the product as it will be sold, packaged, etc.

Now, with that out of the way, this is a film that I sincerely hope gets treated nicely when it is released on Blu-ray (and DVD).  I will say that in looking at the current specifications, I'm a bit underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed that this isn't promised as a Blu-ray and DVD combo, and also frustrated that, at least so far, it only mentions the frustrating and very disappointing UltraViolet Digital Copy.  My own preference would be for an Amazon digital copy or an iSomething digital copy that I can use on my pad or tablet device or my fruity TV player device.  UltraViolet has been a frustrating adventure indeed as the account creation/log-in requirements for the various UltraViolet partners leads to a confusing mess of code redemptions that seem to be for no purpose other than to generate statistics of customers that don't even bother to redeem these digital copies (so that the studios can cry about how people just don't want these things).

Personally I like the Blu-ray/DVD combo packages since it means I can take my copies of films to my parents home to share with them without fearing that they don't yet have a Blu-ray player.  I know there are plenty of people that feel that the combo packages, as well as the digital copies, mean that these products are priced higher than they need to be and I understand the desire for single-disc movie only (""no frills"") packages that would theoretically be less expensive.  In reality though, it seems that the studios are bound and determined to put out packages that will retail at a certain price point and no amount of consumer reaction will change their minds.

Anyway, let me move on to a short, but hopefully fairly well spoiler free, look at this film and get into why I rate the film as highly as I do.

Over the years it seems that Hollywood could rightfully be accused of mostly ignoring and failing to target more mature (read that as code for ""older"") audiences.  For the most part, if it doesn't bleed, blow-up spectacularly, lead to uncontrollable laughter or other reactions from younger audiences then the hopes of seeing a film made and released seems to be nil.  Hollywood concentrates on creating films that appeal to the seemingly all important 18-35 year range of consumers while occasionally creating content for families with youngsters and once in a great while creating films that have appeal to more mature members of society.

Older actors and actresses often lament the lack of opportunity to continue to work in the film industry, though they are sometimes offered roles as parents or senior statesmen, mentors or other similar roles in films that skew towards younger generations.  Once and in while someone comes along with a film such as this one that offers prime roles to these older and well established actors and actresses and if we're all lucky those roles are ones that offer these stars a chance to shine.

Streep and Jones are certainly accomplished movie stars, each with an impressive body of work to look back on.  Having seen this film, I'd say that their performances here are every bit as good as any they've logged previously as they both make the characters they are playing here incredibly believable and incredibly sympathetic as the audience is introduced to the lives of two halves of a couple that has drifted apart over their years together.  Streep's Kay is living out her later years going through the routine that has become her life.  Jones' Arnold starts his day with the usual breakfast that Kay prepares for him and then proceeds to go to work only to come back home and eventually fall asleep in front of the TV showing the Golf Channel or an ESPN type broadcast.  Neither seems to be romantically interested in the other except for perhaps an fairly emotionless kiss before leaving for work, or... hmm, maybe Kay really is interested in more as the audience is shown Kay's nervous glances and mannerisms that show that she has something she wants to talk about with Arnold but just doesn't seem to be able to get to.  When we're shown Kay reviewing a brochure for a couples counseling/therapy series, it becomes obvious to the audience what is really on Kay's mind.

These events were all ""spoiled"" for potential movie goers in the trailers and advertising leading up to the theatrical release of this film.  What wasn't spoiled was what happens when the couple inevitably goes on to the counseling with Steve Carrell's Dr. Feld (at least not terribly spoiled).  What unfolds is an incredibly believable and heart tugging look at this mature couple and the story of how they arrived at this point in their life and more importantly what they can do to get the old magic back, if that is even possible.

Both Kay and Arnold react in ways that are tender, touching and sometimes outrageously funny.  Seeing the story unfold on the big screen where wife 2.0 and I enjoyed a screening with a sell-out crowd led to moments of laughter as well as the proverbial ""awwwwwww"" or other similar reactions.  Clearly all of the parties involved here, from the screen writer, the director and the actors, all cooperated nicely to produce a film that hit the right notes and should appeal to a wide range of consumers.  With that said, this film is one that likely will go ignored by much of the under 40 crowd.  They'll likely look at this as a film that their parents might enjoy, but not so much be one they'd like see, at least not until they too are balding or graying and feeling a little more mature themselves.  Sadly those that take that approach will be missing a gem of film.

One final (for now, as I may come back and update this review when the Blu-ray is released and I have the copy I'm going to order in hand) note here -- this is not necessarily a film that would appeal to family viewers.  I'm not sure that I'd like to sit and watch this film with my daughter, and I'm sure that wife 2.0 wouldn't want to watch it with hers, though I suppose they might surprise me.  Sitting down as a family though, and watching it together as parents and children, would be, well, awkward.  The same could be said if I sat down to watch this with my own parents, though I did highly recommend to my own parents that they catch this film in theaters while they could (and they did, and they reported back they enjoyed it immensely).

Actually one last thought here (even as I said ""one final note"" above), as I was thinking of another film that I recently enjoyed watching on Blu-ray that also involved a more mature cast.  If you are searching for something that would appeal to an more mature audience, then give serious consideration to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Exotic-Marigold-Hotel-Blu-ray/dp/B005S9EJ46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [Blu-ray</a>].
