8424520,5,B004CZZZUE,"This is a great crime drama movie starring Darren McGavin and Maggie Hayes. This is another excellent release by Sony Pictures Entertainment archives with great video and audio transfer. The movie is in Widescreen, is in black & white and runs for about 82min. As expected this doesn't have any special features and I think it has English subtitles. The other stars in this movie are; Warren Stevens, Peggy McCay, Tol Avery, Brian G. Hutton, Joe Turkel, plus others. This movie has some what of a Film Noir feel to it. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend this.",1344124800,2,576,4.6568627450980395
