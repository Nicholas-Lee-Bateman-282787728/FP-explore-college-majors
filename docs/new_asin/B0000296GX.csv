1252684,4,B0000296GX,"Perhaps the best representation of 1970s ski town life ever put on film.
I saw Scrapple at the 1998 Breckenridge Film Fest. The description of the film read, ""Pigs, drugs, and ski bums."" I was intrigued,  to say the least, by what would be my favorite film of the festival.
The  opening credit scenes had me believing I was watching a movie that was  filmed in the mid '70s. By the second scene I knew I was in for a great  film. Having lived in ski towns for the past 10 years, I can safely say  that Scapple does an outstanding job of relaying the universal, timeless  truisms of ski town life.
Entertaining, funny, and cinematically  beautiful, the film sends a small message that hits close to home. During  the story we fall in love with Al Dean, the king of blind luck, in his  efforts to make things right.
This is a film that was put together  remarkably well, especially for a first time, independent project. After  seeing a movie like Scrapple, one wonders how this film isn't being  distributed on a national level, when so many undeserving movies are. I  suppose blame lies in the unenlightened viewing public and not in the  quality of the film, as Scrapple is the most underrated film I have yet to  see.
Kudos to the Hanson brothers for their grassroots efforts to get  this movie seen by appreciative moviegoers.",953078400,2,1329,4.544303797468355

This witty independent film is all about vibe.  Set high in the Colorado Rockies in the late seventies, join Al Dean (Geoff  Hanson) on his easy going journey to the promised land: the American Dream.  If you like good music, beautiful scenery, and quality hair styles - buy  this film.
A great effort from the Hanson Brothers!",947462400,2,410,4.732394366197183
7915623,5,B0000296GX,"This is a fun and entertaining independent film with a superb soundtrack and a great storyline.  I think it's a perfect way to spend an hour and a half, whether you are stoned when you watch it or not.",1353888000,,201,4.153846153846154
7915624,5,B0000296GX,"My older brother would go to the movie store with his girlfriend and pass by Scrapple every day. The back of the movie said ""Babe the pig on acid"". His girlfriend would never want to rent it, but eventually they did, and he loved it. He reccomended I watch it, and I loved it. It is a movie about living the dream..

Anybody who has wanted to live as a ski bum in Colorado will enjoy this story. it's about a good group of friends, some of them with problems, living in a small town. Of course, they use drugs and there's the town Cop, who reminds me of Boss Hogg from Dukes of Hazzard. This is a unique movie any hippy, liberal, ski bum, free spirit, or curious film watcher will enjoy. Check it out, it was worth a purchase for me.",1172448000,,733,4.125874125874126
7915625,5,B0000296GX,"No, this is not a movie about skiing.  If you're looking for that, look elsewhere.  I don't want to overdo it, but this movie is really about life: overcoming pain, love, friends, finding your place, havin a good time, music...Not a film anyone who's a fan of ""Hot Dog"" or other such ski movies would like or even understand.  If you've ever been enlightened by Nepalese Temple Balls, you'll probably like it.",1156291200,,409,4.652777777777778
7915626,4,B0000296GX,"The movie that's depicted in the above pic, and on it's way here is not like the product description. This one is actually a good movie.

Set in a fictional ski town of Ajax, Colorado, Scrapple serves up a really interesting slice of life. Taking place over the summer, the story is outlined by the life of Scrapple the pig.

Scrapple, the prize for the winner at the end of the ski season pig chase, the dharma piglet goes to live with a few locals, who decide to raise and fatten her up for their sacrificial autumn roast in honor of the snow god Ullr. Al Dean, the local dealer is also busy trying to buy a house for his brother so he can leave the VA. And when he gets his shipment of the legendary Nepalese Temple Balls, Al will finally have enough money to rock and roll! Of course, he has a few obstacles to clear first...

Taj Mahal scored the movie and did a great job. Scrapple is a cool flick, and if you're into this type of movie you should really see it!",1152921600,2,968,4.165775401069519
7915627,5,B0000296GX,"The film makers thought they would have a great schtick for their movie---a pig (named scrapple!) in one of the film's central roles... but then babe came along. The ""dharma pig"" Scrapple's non-speaking part couldn't compete, but he did provide the great marketing slogan, the title of this review.

This is a great movie, a must-see for anyone who has lived in the Colorado mountains, and an entertaining indie pic for anyone else. Awesome soundtrack, mostly Taj Mahal (all the incidental music and some excellent reworkings of familiar songs), but also John Martin, John Prine, J. J. Cale, and others. Uniquely for an independent film, this is a period piece, set in 1970s Telluride (""Ajax"" in the movie), just before it became the ""THE destination resort in North America"". There is some good acting by Brad Pitt's former roommate Buck Simmonds (as Tom Sullivan, aka ""Easy""), Bunzy Bunworth (as the bartender Errol McNamara), and the gorgeous Ryan Massey (as Tom's new love interest Beth), but some performances are somewhat amateurish. This does not detract from the well-contructed plot and the easy-going nostalgia of an era past.

""Highly"" recommended. You can purchase the DVD and video, and the great soundtrack, at [...]",1109808000,,1230,5.114427860696518
7915628,3,B0000296GX,"Scrapple is indeed the best movie I've seen that captures ski bum life- and it has an awesome soundtrack. But the plot is stupid and the characters (especially the bad guys) are 2-dimensional. Worse though is that there is hardly any skiing! (just one short flashback- it takes place in summer).  I'm sorry- you can not have the quintessential skibum movie without more skiing- or at least more time on the ski area or in the backcountry. The trick is to do it without it becoming ""Hot Dog"" or a Greg Stump movie.  Anyone know a movie that does that?",1078704000,,550,4.49
7915629,4,B0000296GX,"Boy, did this film ever evoke the seventies for me.  It is a pleasantly meandering, nice time, watching this film.  I would change nothing in this film.  Its cast, its superb location, its quasi-humourous action, its mild plot, its great conversations, its very human moments ... all of it is right on target for the film's goals. You see the Colorado exteriors, the woodsy interiors, the seventies ski-bum clothes and skier's tans, the (too)pervasive dope smoking, the wonderfully loose and easy house parties ... it is as if the filmmakers captured the past in a bottle and put in on screen.  If you're looking for a laid-back, easy-going movie that doesn't waste a single moment, doesn't bore you for an instant, but just rolls along on its own path, this is it. The filmmakers have an eye for detail, for color, for natural settings, for language, for different friendships and for camera shots that are artful and smart without being self-consciously arty that is really worthy. I hope someone gives them money to make more films, because the talent behind this movie is self-evident. They captured a type of youthful experience that the uptight workaday world is a million miles away from in a way that resonates in your mind. And this film has a gentle heart.",1009929600,2,1266,4.820276497695852
7915630,5,B0000296GX,"I spotted this video at the local rental and was curious. Since then I've bought it and sent it around to my old ski-bum gang. We all agree them Hansen boys captured our life outside of Vail perfectly. No work,all play, cheap dope,and just great times and friendships. A sweet movie that is a gem.",1007510400,,297,4.418181818181818
7915631,5,B0000296GX,"Scrapple is about life in a small mountain town in colorado. It embellishes and embraces the pure pleasures of high altitude living. From skiing the powder, to hot springs, to rock climbing, to temple balls. This movie embodies the feeing of being a ski bum, living in a mountain town and doing what comes natural to make a living. Also and most importantly, it's the story of a pig... A wee pig that found enlightenment and grew into a Dharma pig. Long live Scrapple!!!",993513600,,470,4.607142857142857
7915632,5,B0000296GX,"I'm the type of person who watches a film only once.  Scrapple blew me away! I ended up watching it 3 times in three day.  Scrapple delivers romance, heartbreak, drugs, suspense, humor, and one cool pig.  The story  flows well and the characters are believable, who could ask for more.  I  think alot of us would like to live in the mythical mountain town of Ajax.  I sure would!",956707200,,379,4.405797101449275
