5582348,4,B00BEEKN26,"I knew within the first ten minutes that this series is one I would follow. I could feel the tension, the suspense, as mom awakens after dreaming her son was on a cliff. As the morning moves on, she discovers that her son, Danny is missing. He has not been to school, did not go to his paper boy job, and doesn't answer his phone. She soon finds out her boy has died.

DI Alec Hardy has been on the job a week in this pleasant seaside town. Crime rate is low and we learn that he has had some problem with a previous case. He is brusque but efficient. He wants everything done correctly. He is called to the beach where the body of a boy has been found.

DI Ellie Miller,  played by Olivia Coleman is superb. She returns from a three week vacation to find her promotion has been given to another, DI Hardy. She is very angry and frustrated, with no time to deal with her feelings she is called to the beach where she recognizes the young man who has died. There she meets DI Hardy for the first time.

There you have it, each person has a story, and we are in for quite a ride. I keep hearing that the end is shocking. I think I know who the killer is, we will soon find out!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-08-13",1375920000,112,1213,4.10126582278481
5582349,4,B00BEEKN26,"The link to Broadchurch popped up on m Facebook feed, and figuring I had a little time to kill, I decided to give the first episode a shot.
Overall, the show isn't bad. You've got your semi-typical cop drama that has people who are deeply connected with the townsfolk, a cop with a shattered past that he wants to leave in the shadows, and the outer cast of supporting bodies to progress small strands of the general storyline. There is a hint of a deeper mystery from the primary episode, and with the way it ends you bet I will be grabbing the next episode as soon as it releases.",1375920000,5,582,4.3
5582350,5,B00BEEKN26,"An ensemble cast of what seems to be effortless believe ability, this program, from the British beach side to the small town dynamics and the deathly ""anomaly"", left me a bit frightened for everyone.  By episode's end, each character, except for the chief investigator and his able assistant, seems to be a suspect and the guarantee that the perpetrator cannot hide and will be found, made the meaning of the small bits of evidence showing the victim's whereabouts the previous evening an unbearable wait.  I am hooked.  Very well played and highly recommended.  I can't wait for the next episode.",1375920000,3,597,4.94
5582351,5,B00BEEKN26,"I was drawn into this series immediately. A fan of David Tennant from his Doctor Who days, I was waiting impatiently for this series to come to this side of the pond. Olivia Colman plays a police officer, Ellie Miller who returns from vacation to find that she has been passed over for a promotion in favor of David Tennant's character Alec Hardy.
The two are called to investigate the death of a young boy, whose son is best friends with Ellie's son.
Other former Doctor Who actors include Arthur Darville,as the town vicar, and David Bradley, as a shop owner and the boy's employer.
I look forward to watching more Broadchurch!",1375920000,29,629,4.625
5582352,5,B00BEEKN26,"Never thought tv crime drama could be such riveting storytelling. The depth of characters is unbelievable even after the first one or two episodes. Beyond this, the absolutely haunting music of the Icelandic Olafur Arnalds contributes to the telling of the story through all eight episodes. Apparently, the musical score was recorded in an empty church in Reykjavik by a string quartet no doubt adding an extra quality of authentic yet eerie music. Just when you thought story, location and music were essential ingredients contributing to the success of this highly addictive series, the key protagonists/actors ( David Tennant and Olivia Colman) contribute a big wallop leaving an everlasting aftertaste even after the last credit ""Broadchurch will return.""",1374624000,6,759,5.440677966101695
5582353,5,B00BEEKN26,"This is a wonderful whodunit, with a seemingly endless supply of suspects, red herrings, twists and turns, and secrets to be unearthed. Most American TV shows don't bother to go this deeply into the characters - and I'm finding that I really enjoy a drama that provides me with characters that are more than cardboard cut-outs by the end. I also really enjoy that this story takes eight hours to be fully told, and doesn't simply wrap itself up in an hour or two.

Broadchurch's primary strength is in the fantastic, stellar performances of its cast: David Tennant is brilliant as a driven, PITA, haunted, and seriously ill DI Hardy; Olivia Coleman develops from a bright and bubbly DS pissed at having her promotion stolen from beneath her into a haunted and suspicious woman; and Jody Whittaker and Andrew Buchan as the murdered boy's parents key into the emotions any parent would feel in their situation - and that's just to name a few, key roles.

Another strength lies in the mechanics of storytelling at its best: making us care about the characters, whether they were main characters or supporting role only. Chibnall takes his time telling this story, and turns the spotlight of the plot on each ""suspect"" in turn, so that we have no cardboard cutout ""villains"", but rather fallible humans from which to choose our suspects. He doesn't lay all the suspects out in front of us at once, but presents each in their turn as they would have come the the attention of the police. There are red herrings galore: plot twists and subtle misdirections that paint the character involved with suspicion, deservedly or no.

And finally, there is a fantastic strength in the unflinching way the story wraps up, seeing the grief that such a small village where everybody knows everybody else's business would have to go through to begin the healing process.

All in all, this program is the reason I ended up purchasing a region-free Blu-ray/DVD player, because I absolutely HAD to have this as soon as it was available.

Give it a try.  It starts slowly, so be patient - but there are hints even in the first episode of the complexity of the story that is going to unfold.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.",1372723200,21,2210,4.724675324675324
5582354,5,B00BEEKN26,"This 8 episode drama kept me in suspense.  I couldn't help but watch half the episodes all in one sitting and the rest the next day.  The story is well written and tight, filled with emotion and wrought with tension.  Tennant and Colman shine and the other actors do a superb job as well.  This is definitely a must-see and well worth every minute.",1371600000,2,348,4.390625
5582355,5,B00BEEKN26,"The most extraordinary story ever, written & produced by Chris Chipnall, one of the top British writers today. A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.

The body of a 11 year old boy is found on the beach in Dorset, England. The murder and following investigation create a chain reaction that will tear this small seaside town apart. A town wrapped in secrets, like most small towns anywhere in the world, and they become known as the investigation proceeds. The Murderer remains veiled until the final episode and a surprise and more importantly the reason.
The two investigators, DI Hardy a harden, efficient, and blunt outsider with the reputation for failure - played brilliantly by David Tennant - and DS Miller a sensitive and friendly local - played by the extraordinary Olivia Coleman. The interactions between these two is amazing - some of the best dialog and zingers - like when Miller tells Hardy ""leave me alone or I will piss in a cup and throw it on you."" - Or when Hardy tells Miller ""I pray nightly that you will leave me alone.""  The remaining Cast is spectacular - you can actually feel the grief and suspicion coming from their characters.  The film is well worth getting if you like great drama and great acting.

This film is 8 episodes or about 6 hours, so you don't have to watch all at once but I bet once you start watching, you won't want to stop. I purchased my DVD from Amazon.co.uk, which I got in late May of 2013 - about 9 months ahead of the American region 1 version going on sale and play on a multi-region DVD player or my computer.",1369440000,84,1711,4.491961414790997

5582357,5,B00BEEKN26,"Sorry to say, I watched this on Netflix.  But its a great show.  If you love British programs and detective series, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is superb.  And the endings are satisfying.",1514419200,,220,4.2926829268292686
5582358,5,B00BEEKN26,"I picked up Broadchurch because, you know, David Tennant.  Doctor Who fan.  But I also enjoy British mystery in book or television form.  I was not disappointed.  And at the same time there is so much I can't say without spoiling it.
The characters are amazingly gritty and real, to the point that I would cringe a few times a episode, thinking about how I would not be able to handle many of the encounters and interactions between many of the people in the town.  All the actors and actresses are brilliant.  I didn't know who Olivia Colman was before watching this and now I am sure to notice any show she is in.  Also I got to see how good Jodie Whitaker is - the next Doctor!
The plot?  A boy is found dead on the beach.  And the episodes show us that EVERYBODY in this town has some dark secret that they don't want others to know.  EVERYBODY!  It does a great job of twisting and turning back on itself.  By the end I thought I KNEW who the murderer was but realized I was wrong by the second-to-last episode and I was truly surprised and saddened when I found out who it was.  I have been told that the second season is not as good but the third is just as good, so I will likely be looking to buy both of them.  Not much in the way of extras and only eight episodes.  But that is still A LOT of great entertainment!

They all act as shady as possible and then wonder why they're looked at suspiciously and then get SUPER ANGRY about it. Then suddenly everything is fine and we're suspecting some other person. It's all a bit manipulative while trying to be clever. Olivia Coleman is great but no one in this town behaves like a normal human being.

5582373,3,B00BEEKN26,"There will sort of a spoiler in here, so let me warn you, there is a very nonspecific spoiler alert.

I have a very specific problem with this mystery.  When you come to the very end of the series, if you think about it, the guilty person could have been ANYONE.  You cannot, by watching this series, and accumulating a series of clues, eventually arrive at a pretty good guess at the killer.  Everything is a fake.  Now, this is fine, is, while you are being faked out, you are also seeing clues but they are clever and you are missing them.  That is not the case here.  When it comes to the final episode, it is as if the writers flipped a coin and said, ""Okay, let's make ___ the guilty one.""  It is that arbitrary.

You can forgive a show for this sort of thing, if the characters are interesting enough.  Endeavor is an interesting guy; that priest detective (Grantchester) is an interesting guy.  So, as a result, you can forgive their less than perfect shows (the plots for both tend to be quite convoluted).  I saw Broadchurch's first season a few months ago, and I could not tell you a single thing about the lead characters, more than what I see in the cover of the DVD.",1504483200,,1180,4.3136363636363635

David Tennant and Olivia Coleman shine as detectives: and their sparring has none of the usual chatter among the detective and subordinate. It is mature, wry, and humorous interaction, which makes the series so special. The mystery is special: it is basically a feminist plot. The side plots keeps the series afloat in a blaze of excellence. The connection between the Ist and 2nd Series: the grieving father and the wife who's fed up from her husband's grief are portrayed without sentimentality. Yes, most people are miserable in this series: but they come together in a blissful ending.

5582429,3,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch fell smack onto the pretty good category for me. I did keep watching until the end of season 1.

First, the good parts: David Tennant's lovely scottish voice, withering tongue, and fierce gaze was a pleasure to watch, always. Olivia Colman was a very good partner for him. Both are convincing actors, but he's the star. Also, the sub-plots were good, giving a fine sense of a small town that reveals its secrets slowly and in unexpected ways.

What I didn't like:  The scriptwriting repeatedly failed on plausibility. I won't go into details, because I don't want to put out spoilers. But there were many issues that felt annoyingly unlikely to me, for both emotional content, and logistics. Some scenes were outright ludicrous. Other reviewers have commented on the show's realism. I didn't find it so. The writers' method for creating suspense was to make every person in the village look suspicious, in sequence.  I found this to be an artificial device. Its was so obvious that it killed suspense instead of building it.",1477094400,,1036,4.902857142857143

The first ep was kind of slow; the second was tedious; and after the third, I gave up on it. The actors are great, but the characters are totally boring.

5582453,5,B00BEEKN26,"Thoroughly enjoyable -- well acted and crisply directed, and with enough twists and turns to satisfy die-hard mystery addicts.  At heart, it's a basically old-fashioned set-up, but the series format both intensifies it and enlarges it.  The ""old-fashioned"" element is the basic structure -- a relatively small group of suspects in a relatively small community, all knowing one another. And instead of a single Poirot or Miss Marple, we have two detectives, one a local and one an outsider.  Add to that that their relationship is fraught and that the outsider (David Tennant's character) has personal and health-related problems of his own.  All of these are pretty familiar elements, but they're cunningly brought together here, and the long format enables us to get good looks at all the suspects and even a few who aren't.  One not-so-old-fashioned feature is the way that murder that initiates the story -- a boy's body is found on the beach, and he has been strangled -- comes to the notice of national tabloid newspapers, abetted by elements in the local press.  In fact, by the end of the series, it's easy to feel that the journalists are the real villains of the piece, even after the identity of the murderer has been revealed.

As with many such stories, nearly all the suspects have things they want to hide -- not necessarily criminal activity but things that they are ashamed of or feel are their private business.  So they lie to the police (and one another), or they tell incomplete stories, and the finding out about their histories -- and judging whether or not to be sympathetic to their desire to keep things private -- is a strong part of the interest as we go forward, although that interest never gets in the way of our interest in the solution of the crime.  The detectives, Hardy and Miller (Tennant and Olivia Coleman) are very well played.  Pauline Quirke is powerful in the pivotal role of Susan Wright (another outsider) and the great David Bradley -- familiar to me from some work with Mike Leigh (""Another Year"") and from the ""Harry Potter""movies -- has a poignant turn as perhaps the one who suffers most from the press attention.  But to be fair, the casting is strong throughout.  And once you start watching, the urge to binge it out is hard to resist.  Great stuff.",1467763200,2,2301,4.751256281407035

5582460,1,B00BEEKN26,"But 6 hours of looking at that disheveled, unshaven David Tennant with his forced accent?  Give me a break. He was pointlessly weird and silly. By the fourth episode I had had enough but trudged on to discover the killer that they went to great lengths to keep secret, but it became rather obvious who it was. The story is reasonably good, as such, but there are red herrings galore, hours of pointless conversations, scenes that are totally irrelevant just to stretch things out, with a weak ending that is rather anticlimactic. It would have probably made a good 2 hour movie, with all the useless chaff cut out.  I will watch Season 2 only because I love Charlotte Rampling but am not really anxious to trudge through another 6 hours of David Tennant and that cast of boring characters that I didn't give a rat's ass about in the first season.

5582473,2,B00BEEKN26,"Hmmm I like David Tennant. And would have given this a higher review based on his performance alone. But there's too many problems. A boy is found dead on a beach and a new police officer to the area (Tennant) is to lead the investigation. His female counterpart has been on holiday and returns thinking she would get the promotion that Tennants character stepped into. So there's instant resentment. But that's not the problem. The police procedural is awful. True this is a TV show, but they blunder through crime scenes, don't do background checks or look for the ""usual suspects"" that tend to be checked out when a child dies. Seeing how the community react, and all their secrets makes it interesting. But as the series unfolds it's clear Tennants character isn't fit for a hair cut never mind being a police inspector. His co-Hort's ties would have made her ineligible to be part of the investigation. She clearly can't be objective. It's just a bit of a mess. A real shame. It had promise.

5582481,5,B00BEEKN26,"This terrific 8 part TV mini series is an intense multiple character study and social commentary wrapped in a murder mystery.  Made in the UK, its excellent in every department, from the performances to the writing to the direction and cinematography.  Rich to over-flowing with character detail and arresting images, and accompanied by a notably effective and haunting score, Broadchurch shows how a small town is pulled apart by the unsolved killing of an 11 year old boy.  Generally, our main focus is on the two detectives trying to solve a crime that has lots of possible suspects, but no clear culprit.

But the series spends much rewarding and moving  and sometimes even gut-wrenching - time on the victims family and their grief, as well as the shock that runs through the town itself.  We can only watch sadly as the town is slowly engulfed by ever growing paranoia as everyones dirty little secrets are uncovered, either by the police or the press.

The final  pay-off is fulfilling enough, but as with the first season of True Detective the real satisfaction is in the richness of the characters and their world -- the unwinding of the tale, not its wrap up.  There are a couple of tropes that were a little too neat for me  for example the way the two lead detectives are perfect opposites; an optimist and a pessimist, and insider and an outsider, etc.  Its cleaner than the generally wonderfully morally complex and messy world thats been created here.  But thats a minor complaint about a major work, and the two actors playing the leads (David Tennant and Olivia Colman) give such rich performances that ultimately it transcends the few clichs that pop up.

This is a truly haunting piece of story-telling.  In a way it feels like a ghost story -- where the ghost is a dead child whose memory haunts everyone.  I find images and moments have stuck with me for weeks, and I very much look forward to going back and seeing it again, now that I know the tragic secrets of the various citizens of Broadchurch.",1460678400,,2021,4.685552407932011

5582526,5,B00BEEKN26,"I only came across Broadchurch recently, some two years after many of the reviews here. I have watched a number of British mysteries, and continue to be impressed with the quality of the scripts and acting. But Broadchurch is different from the usual mystery/police procedural. Over the eight episodes it takes to solve the murder of an 11-year old boy you have the opportunity to learn about the people of Broadchurch, how they interact with each other, the ""backstories"" (not always pleasant) of some, and the way the murder opens wounds in a seemingly idyllic small seashore community. Much more than a murder mystery that will keep you guessing, this series is a psychological and sociological drama in which there is much suffering, but redemption too.
The acting is superb; it doesn't seem like acting, it is so well-done. This series won't insult your intelligence, but it will tug at your heart.",1441497600,5,903,4.947368421052632

I wasn't initially sure I would like it, given that the season is devoted to solving the murder of the death of a child, but as the episodes unfolded I became more intrigued by the characters that are introduced.  In true BBC fashion, the characters are complex and quirky, the actors are brilliant, and the plot is anything but formulaic.

Watching how each person reacted to the murder, how the church, media, and the town as a whole reacted, was so powerful. My heart broke with them, especially the mom.

5582596,1,B00BEEKN26,"I sometimes wonder if people decide they like something because everyone else says it is terrific.  The reason I watched this was due to Andrew Buchan, one of my favorite British actors.  I was willing to suffer through one of my least favorite, Olivia Colman and someone I never hear of David Tennant who plays the lead.  He plays the sick detective who actually looks gravely ill whether by design for the part of that he really is sick which hopefully it is not the later.

The writer seems to have put into one long and painful series every story idea they ever had over the decades.  There are characters that have major parts then are never heard from again.  People who have nothing to do with the story line, people who had very little screen time yet are major players.  Some would say what a wonderful collection of red herrings.  Objective people would say, what was/is the point of this?  It has absolutely nothing to do with anything but we have wasted 20  30 minutes on a useless scene.  Why did we spend so much time on a character and scenes that went no place, again.

There are some actors that due to the accent are almost impossible to understand and watching mostly British and Scot actors for decades that takes a lot.  Topping it off, when you find out who the killer is, no, wait, you think it is the end but clearly we had a few napkins we wrote ideas on probably in 1970 that we still have to fit in so the murderer gets off with no repercussion.  Really?

This entire debacle could have been done in about 2.5 hours, probably less if you cut out endless minutes of just shots staring at the ocean or walking in contemplation.  If you want to see something worthwhile, rent Garrows Law with Andrew Buchan for a mostly real life mini-series set in period of how most of the free world ended up with the legal system we have now, taken from actually period accounts from the Old Bailey.",1432684800,4,1910,4.414285714285715

5582598,5,B00BEEKN26,"In the first series of Broadchurch from 2013, a small English town is shaken by the death of eleven year old Danny Lattimer (Oskar McNamara) and Alex Hardy (David Tennant), a detective inspector newly arrived in Broadchurch and lifelong local Detective Seargeant Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) are charged with investigating the case, and along the way they unearth many buried secrets of Broadchurchs citizens.

While Tennant is the best known star in the series internationally, itd be a mistake to assume that this a series about the investigators alone or primarily a David Tennant vehicle. The series is just not about the mystery, though there are plenty of clues and red herrings, but how this affects an entire community and then there are separate plots that work their way through Broadchurch: How the family handles this as well as learning of the husbands infidelity, a discouraged minister, an ambitious young reporter, a self-proclaimed psychic telephone repairman, and then the suspects: some are hiding something, but in a few cases, we learn that people we've been suspecting have only been trying to hide a very painful past. It's not a story with disposable characters.

As such, the middle four episodes feel like an ensemble piece and a very good one at that. What Broadchurch does is make characters who feel like real people.  There are secrets but most of them aren't off the wall things. There's real human conflict at work.

My favorite character outside of the leads was Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill of Doctor Who) who was really revealed to be a strong character despite starting off looking much more like

In the hands of an amateur or a weak creative team, this type of story becomes a mess of characters running around. At the same time, the series succeeds on a directorial level. The way the story of Broadchurch is told is superb and nearly flawless with music, acting, and storytelling working together to tell a narrative. This is brilliant filmmaking and art on television which is just not something you see.

The mystery is good, although it's probably the weakest part of the series. There are a lot of clues and red herring thrown in throughout the series. It's hard to sort through, and the most important clues are ones that Alex Hardy knows but doesn't share with the audience. Still, there are a few clues to the killer that the attentive viewer can pick up.

While this is a great series, it's one that really requires parental discretion and is definitely not for the whole family.  The series deals with serious issues that surround the death of a child and what could motivate it. While it was produced for broadcast television, it was produced for British broadcast television which has different standards than broadcasts in other countries. There's very little sexual content or  violence  but some language that would not make it on American broadcast television.

5582608,2,B00BEEKN26,"I was anxious to watch the new series with David Tennant but it was difficult for me to get through the first episode. I tried watching it several times over several months and finally got through it yesterday. After that, it was a marathon.

It takes the eight episodes of season one to solve one murder. They take their time and it is not rushed. However, a lot of season one is not as well done as I had hoped. Tennant overacts his character to the point it is very unrealistic. His partner's actions and words are also unrealistic. Many things happen throughout this series that are just too much of a stretch to believe. It's both the major events and the little things of everyday life ... how people treat each other, their reactions, simple conversations. This makes it impossible to get 'lost' in the series because you start thinking about the acting and writing too many times in each episode. Although it was a mildly interesting 'whodunit' first season, and worth watching for free on Netflix, this is far under par in both writing and acting.

One example is a main character stumbling through the police station with a heart condition, falling against a wall and barely remaining conscious while people just stand and stare. In real life, people would be rushing to this person's side and trying to help.

Another example, the actions and evidence associated with the father and sister of the victim would never be handled in such a manner by police. It is a joke. Cash, cocaine and whopping lies? The police never press nor fully investigate these things?

Another example is the poor hygiene by Tennant throughout the entire season. You wonder, ""Does he ever shower or shave?"" No boss would ever tolerate such.

The reason I don't cite the MAJOR unbelievable things is because they are spoilers. At the end, you will realize this murder should have been solved by the second episode.

3 stars is being highly, highly generous to David Tennant. Watch for free on Netflix.",1430611200,,1987,4.728323699421965

The dialogue and situations are almost exactly the same in the two series but the actors and feel of the show is very different. David Tennant plays the same role in each version. All I can say is that the feeling and acting of the British version is outstanding. The American version not so much.

It's much more believable, and thus, much more engaging. That being said, it is a bit darker than the swill you'll encounter on the major broadcast channels.

The plot was certainly sufficiently complex and complemented by good character development. In my view, the only real problem with the series was the very disappointing finale. Why ""disappointing""?  Because the writers had an excellent opportunity to weave a really superb concluding episode that could have included several of the possible suspects in a conspiracy that would have made perfect sense. In stead, several important lines of investigation are just dropped, potential suspects unidentified, suspicious interactions unexplained, missing hours in time lines ignored, etc. All of these combined to make the ending unworthy of the writers' obvious skills.",1429056000,,805,5.491935483870968

I felt the mystery unraveled with a whimper in the last episode. Shows like Midsomer Murders or Inspector Lewis handle stories like Broadchurch season 1, in just one episode. The acting is good but given the pace, Broadchurch season 1 seems to seesaw between a soap opera and an addictive mystery.",1429056000,,567,4.855670103092783

5582627,5,B00BEEKN26,"Police detective Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) returns from a vacation expecting to find a promotion to chief inspector in her hometown of Broadchurch, England. The town is a small seaside village where everyone knows everyone else; life is quiet and pleasant. Back in the office, she discovers Alec Hardy (David Tennant) has been hired to the post. He's a detective from another part of England who has both a disdain for their small town and an abrasively cold demeanor. They do not hit it off well since she loves her community and is warm and caring. When an eleven-year old local boy's body is found on the beach, the investigation spirals out of control as the personal secrets of almost everyone in town are revealed while the local and national media put the worst possible spin on discovered secrets.

With eight hour-long episodes, the series delves deep into the characters' histories and motivations. Hardy's coldness and drive to find the killer come from a past where he failed to help another family in similar circumstances. He sees Broadchurch as a place to do penance and to find redemption. The eleven-year old boy's family suffer through many different horrible circumstances and secrets. Miller's son was friends with the dead boy, providing a personal connection to the case (though practically everyone in town has personal connections except for Hardy). The local vicar is young and has been trying to connect to the community. He rises to the occasion as the town faces the death and the secrets that start people pointing fingers at each other. The local press is goaded into action by the arrival of a London news writer who senses many opportunities arising from the boy's death. All these different threads come together naturally, moving the drama and the investigation forward in compelling ways.

The show is also very even-handed in its characterizations. Everyone has flaws, some quite serious. At first a few people seem purely evil but eventually their own hard histories come to light, which may not justify their wrong choices but makes those choices understandable to a degree. The people are emotionally and intellectually gripping.

The murder mystery is also interesting though it acts as a catalyst for other human dramas. This show is no standard police procedural. The ending is devastating but satisfying. I am not sure how they have a second series but I will definitely give it a try.

I was inspired to watch this show by (you guessed it) the good folks at A Good Story is Hard to Find Podcast which discusses this series on Episode 103.",1428796800,,2585,4.935632183908046

All of the actors are excellent and the story is usually complex, interesting and exciting.

The writing is inconsistent however. At times the show is deep and authentic but at others it is glib and seems to aim for ""cute"". It feels like the story did not have a strong editor with a coherent vision.

As noted by other reviewers, Broadchurch has too many episodes for a single ""whodunit"". Episodes two through seven are basically a series or wild goose chases. Maybe ""he"" did it... no, she did... wait a minute, what about him?  And so on.

The end is not so much shocking as incongruent. Nothing earlier suggested the guilt of the ""perp"" so there is no ""aha"" moment where the whole plot comes together. Honestly, I felt slightly relieved when it ended.

Broadchurch is a tense and extremely suspenseful (no spoon-feeding of clues) British eight (8) part drama that is set in a very picturesque sea-side small town.  Where everyone knows everyone and all their personal business--there are a lot of secrets held.  A beloved child (from a beloved family with its own problems lurking below the surface) is mysteriously murdered and two detectives (superbly acted by Grace Point and David Tennantboth dealing with their own nasty issues) set out to bring the culprit to justice.  In the solving of the mystery there are many suspects, many accusations and many lives destroyed. There are rumors and innuendoes of pedophilia.  There is  marriage infidelity  that threatens a supposed happy  marriage and  journalistic mistrust.  The once peaceful village turns into a seething volcano of negative innuendos.

5582688,5,B00BEEKN26,"Yet Another British cop drama, and Yet Another show set in a small, idyllic community, this time on the Dorset Coast, in Southwest England. It's Yet Another gritty blend of mystery and police procedural, following the investigation into the death of a 11-year old boy. Once Again we meet the many bland and eccentric personalities that make up a small town, delving into the lies both harmless and explosive that expose the ugliness just below that quaint surface. Of Course, you have wrong turns and red herrings, before the final, shocking revelation.

Just another cop drama... except it isn't. Not remotely. I don't think there's ever been a BBC or ITV drama as emotionally engaging and intellectually satisfying as 'Broadchurch'. Any synopsis is going to completely fail in its attempt to convey the power of this short, nearly perfect series. I had heard comments about 'Broadchurch', but a brief look at the premise suggested 'just another well-done, mostly forgettable BBC-ITV series'. It took a while, due to my lack of enthusiasm, but I finally got around to watching it. Needless to say, I'm glad I did. Forget the plot, forget the actors -- although the two leads are brilliant, particularly David Tennant -- all you need to know is that, along with the French series 'The Returned', this is the best European television drama of the last few years.",1425772800,3,1361,4.943231441048035

5582722,5,B00BEEKN26,"I would be very wary about reading too many reviews of ""Broadchurch""!! This show is fantastic, and you, as a potential viewer will actually mess up the experience if you read spoilers. I will keep my review as vague as possible, because this show is too good to ruin for anyone who hasn't discovered it yet. In all honesty, if you are on the fence about watching this show, simply look at the total number of reviews, and the star rating. There aren't too many other shows rated this highly by so many viewers.

""Broadchurch"" is a series of 8 shows following a single case, the death of a young boy whom we see in the opening moments of the first episode. We soon learn that Broadchurch is a small coastal town that depends on the tourist industry for it's local economy, and it seems everyone knows everyone else in the small town. The young boy's body is soon discovered on the beach and from there the show introduces us to the detectives working the case, as well as several members of the community.

I told it was going to be vague, and I really don't want to go into storyline specifics as the show is much more rewarding if you simply jump in and follow along. What I will say is that ""Broadchurch"" provides a greater look at how the crime impacts those closest to it, not just the detectives, as we usually see in other series. We get to know those closest to the victim, and those caught up in the investigation in a way which most TV shows simply gloss over.

I will say that ""Broadchurch"" is a dark show. This isn't the ""feel good"" show of the year, and you'll usually be a bit down after each episode ends, but you'll also be addicted....and unable to stop yourself from watching the next episode. I like too, that with only 8 episodes, there are no ""filler"" episodes. Highly recommended.",1423526400,2,1801,4.418674698795181

5582725,5,B00BEEKN26,It grabs you from the first 10 minutes and never lets you go. It's about the murder of a young boy in a small-knit village on the coast of England. You see the deep emotion in everyone and feel with the actors. The casting and acting is superb. Everyone is a  suspect and the delivery is excellent without the cringing scenes of violence and sex. It is very emotional and suspenseful and I couldn't stop watching till the end. What A mini-series! I love most BBC productions and this one did not disappoint.,1423353600,,507,4.451612903225806

Jodie Whittaker is outstanding as Beth Latimer is particulary outstanding as are all the actors is this riviting series.  Compares well with Breaking Bad and Homeland.

I personally thought that the UK version's cast was a much more believable ensemble and the raw emotions were affected well by the cast.  While Gracepoint goes deeper in some of the episodes, I felt that the additional effort was put in exclusively for American audiences and not to really further the plot line.",1421971200,2,419,5.057971014492754

So annoyingly captivating that as I finished one episode, I wanted to start right away on the next. I had to pace myself so I didn't binge watch too quickly.
David Tennant is simply brilliant in his role as a brooding, straight-laced Detective Inspector. But he lost out in award season to his equally brilliant co-star Olivia Colman as Ellie Miller. I loved all the casting, which is way more than I can say for the American version, Gracepoint.

I was not disappointed and ended up watching the whole season in one night!  The actors, especially Tennant, are fantastic, it is wonderfully scripted, and the cinematography is brilliant.  A must if you like Sherlock (the only other police type drama I watch, which is also amazing), you will love this.  The characters are relatable and the plot continually develops with no ""fluff"" episodes to drag the pacing down.  After watching shows like Sherlock, Doctor Who, Downton Abbey, Top Gear, and now Broadchurch, I never ceased to be impressed by the quality of British TV over American TV. I highly recommend this show, whether or not it is your typical genre of television.  I have seen the premiere of season 2 and it looks like it will only get better, which is saying something, since it is already a fantastic show!",1420848000,6,1047,4.602150537634409

This show was so good that it sparked an American sequel called Gracepoint. For the most part both shows are identical, but there are also some serious differences as well. ***Spoiler Alert****The killer is not the same person in both shows. So, watching them separately will lead to two different killers. *** ALert over*** Great show, great storytelling, like  a 6 hour movie. David Tennant is wonderful as usual.

5582758,4,B00BEEKN26,"Spent an evening and on into after midnight binge watching this series.  It's one of my favorite genres, British police procedural.  David Tennant, as the story progressed, appeared more and more haggard.  Olivia Colman was composed and compassionate as DS Miller.  Hard not to give too much away.  British television mystery series tend to offer complex stories that are usually well acted.

In this case there was a couple of things that I thought were a little obvious.  One was the low camera angle as stairs were climbed, the other was the framing of actors in half open doors which filled only a fraction of the screen.  Maybe I only noticed this because I was binge watching and if I had spread the episodes out over time it would not have been so obvious.

The  second series has already started in the UK and I'm looking forward another binge watching session.",1420588800,,869,4.695364238410596

5582769,5,B00BEEKN26,"We just finished Season 1 and highly recommend it.  They take the necessary time for developing a complicated murder investigation.  That may sound a little dull but it draws you along as the two detectives keep unraveling and re-unraveling various threads of evidence.  They also show how an entire community gets wrapped up in the horror that touches many lives.  Just to take one example of that, the minister and small local church are initially just another part of the story.  The minister is even under some suspicion at one point.  Eventually some of the folks begin to rely on the minister and their own damaged faith (in anything) to get themselves through their nightmare.  There's no real preaching in the show (and even a short part of a sermon).  And they realize it's a place for supporting each other when they can't understand how this could have happened.  Karen and I are eagerly, if that's the word for it, Season 2.  Well done.",1420156800,,948,4.725609756097561

I was blown away by this show. Tennant's performance was very different from his spunky Doctor Who character, but he did not disappoint me. The show is a classic ""whodunit"" scenario with a murder taking place at the very beginning. Tennant plays a detective who is trying to get to the bottom of this case, despite dealing with his own demons.

Well worth your time to see this series, come to see how the death of a young boy impacts the small coastal community on England's south shore.

I did not see the twist coming, but once I did it was like of course! That is the only thing that would fit! So I was thrilled when they made an Americanized version, Gracepoint, but I think in trying to change it (mostly new cast, location, and parts of the story), it lost some of its magic. I enjoyed watching both, but only own the original, Broadchuch. So if you were disappointed with Gracepoint, I recommend going back to the original.

As the mystery delves deeper, you find yourself getting lost in the town of Broadchurch, feeling a sense of dread both about the revelation of the killer as well as the approaching end of a fantastic story.  The story itself is not groundbreaking, murder in a small town has been done to death - but you get such a rich palette of characters and storylines, that the hunt for the killer is really just the domino that starts the engrossing tale.

5582845,5,B00BEEKN26,"""Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""--F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Let me begin with the ending, not to give it away, but to say that it suddenly brought everything together in a meaningful way and made it all worth while.  It is a story of a small and close knit town where there are secrets but closely kept so it's a perfect little town.  The fabric begins to rip apart and show the undersides when eleven year old Danny is found dead under unusual and suspicious circumstances.  New police investigator Alec Hardy (David Tennant) arrives and takes the position that Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) had expected to be promoted to, so there is instant tension between the two.  Alec Hardy (Tennant) is a micro-managing bad boss, showing her little respect, criticizing her often and in front of others while she tries to move past personal bitterness and focus on the case of Danny Latimer. Ellie's son Tom is a friend of Danny so the death and investigation have many personal issues for her.  Each episode left me hungry for the next one and I found few flaws in the plot.  The music moved the plot along in a dynamic way.  One thing I should mention.  For those who have lost a child, this is powerful and can be painful.  I lost my only son eleven years ago.  He was no longer a child as he was 36 when he died in 2003 but the loss of any child is difficult.  It reopened some things in me and I found myself crying in several episodes but I also learned that I haven't finished grieving and that's good for me to know.  I liked the series and I can recommend it with that one caveat for parents who have lost a child.  Red Boots.",1417046400,3,1635,4.3355263157894735

5582854,5,B00BEEKN26,"Having only seen David Tennant as The Doctor, it was rather interesting to see him in this genre. I didn't know that he was in the series when I put in my Netflix list of videos, so when the first DVD arrived, I was surprised, In one way, having watched him playing one of the best Doctors, you get spoiled in how he would play things. In this incidence, he is driven, has some mysterious medical condition, and has a history from a previous case that haunts him. Plus, he's not clean shaven which is pretty interesting.  I wonder what it would have been like had he played The Doctor in such the same manner?  The subject of this series is dark and it really shows how the mob reaction can be harmful to citizen's of a small community It caused a suicide and there are hints of other darker secrets that keep one on the edge trying to figure out ""whodunit?"".  I am finishing up the third DVD tonight and I think I will buy it for my own collection. My biggest issue is the language. But anymore, you can hardly find a decent program where language isn't an issue. Also, the issue of pedophilia isn't such a nice subject matter, but again the times are making this crime even more open any more. If you haven't got an issue with foul language at times and even a fouler subject matter that is hinted at, then this is a very good series to watch",1416528000,,1344,4.262745098039216

5582861,5,B00BEEKN26,"An unusually well-scripted drama that not only engages you in the ""who done it"" aspect of the mystery, but more importantly leaves the viewer totally engaged with the characters and the village of Broadchurch.  The characters are realistic and recognizable with their flaws, secrets, and sorrows, especially the mother of the murdered child.  Most of the actors are excellent!  Most importantly for me, this is the only show or movie I have ever seen that does a very good job of accurately portraying some of the heartbreaking grief that bereaved parents experience upon the death of a child.  As a bereaved parent myself, this was a refreshing departure from gratuitous, surface level ""grief"" that is usually portrayed.  Despite the gut wrenching nature of the murder in this show, the series leaves us with hope as opposed to despair.  I can't recommend this series highly enough. It is intelligent and very human, from start to finish.",1416355200,6,939,5.025806451612903

5582875,4,B00BEEKN26,"While it's hard to say more than all the rave reviews here have already said (about the great writing, acting, directing, editing), the one slight letdown is the surprise ending in episode eight.  While it has some of the elements of any good surprise ending (i.e. that it would be hard to predict, yet it instantly makes sense of a couple of small details that just click into place when the revelation is made), nonetheless, it lacks one element that all *really* good surprise endings have -- that it feels like a natural development of one of the characters whom we already had gotten to know.

We just don't get enough information about the perpetrator to show in the end (a) why the perpetrator would have been capable of this act and (b) why those closest to him would not have suspected he possessed the character flaw that led to it.  Because of those missing elements, this is just not in the same class as the great surprises in, for example, The Crying Game, The Sixth Sense, or House of Games, where in each case, a well-developed character suddenly has revealed another facet of his or her psyche, and it is something that feels as authentic as it is astounding.

5582885,5,B00BEEKN26,"EXCELLENT series that proved to be thought-provoking and very disturbing. I initially brought to this series because I had seen several of the DR WHO episodes that featured David Tennent. I ordered this series only after briefly hearing that he was associated with it. Once I started watching, I was quickly drawn in. I found it a very interesting mini-series, and although it was technically a 'murder mystery' I didn't find myself trying to 'guess the guilty party' so much as I studied the behavior of so many of the characters. By the end of the series, I found that not only was I off in my suspicions, but I was emotionally drained by the disturbing storyline. Clearly, British television producers have learned a few 'stylistic' touches from their American counterparts, but let's hope that they don't adopt many of our more commercial bad habits. Although some American viewers might find this series too slow a burn, I found the pacing to be just right, as the story paid respectful attention to detail, characterization and tone.

5582893,5,B00BEEKN26,"I saw this way before Gracepoint and there is no comparison. Broadchurch is the stronger series by far. The female detective, Ellie, is so feisty and real that you immediately take to her and she offsets the reticence of her partner so well she makes him likeable.  There are so many great understories going on as well that never take away from the main storyline and only add to it. It really does such a great job taking you into these characters's lives and makes them so authentic that yes the identity of the killer will leave you reeling but not before other personal stories take you on a roller coaster of emotions. The writing and acting is so streamlined and the cinematography is gorgeous and implemented so well with the haunting mood of the story. This is not only the best mystery series in a heavy field of competitors but also just the best and original story I've come across in a long time.

I enjoyed this mystery; I patted myself on the back for suspecting the killer before the penny dropped.

I hadn't known that ""Gracepoint"" was the same story; I started watching that because I was fascinated with Tenant's American accent; I found Broadchurch from reading reviews of Gracepoint. (They picked a different killer for the U.S. version, so say reviews.)

I find this version, Broadchurch, to be more palatable, somehow, the actors more suited. I found, for example, the British ""Mark & Beth"" to be much more sympathetic; their American counterparts I found almost irritating.

Long story short, Broadchurch is good.

Update: I figured out what it was that was bothering me about Broadchurch. There's one scene where Mom is going through her dead son's bedroom, looking at what he's left behind, etc...

The kid is *11* years old. He has a paper route, he does Sea Scouts (or whatever they called it), he has a smart phone ... yet they show Mom on the floor looking at *baby blocks*.

It's rumored to have changed the ending, (no surprise there!) and added 2 extra episodes.

I understand to some extent that the producers/writer's want the audience to be in suspense and keep guessing until the end, but I still think there could have been some subtle clues from the character, who was revealed at the end, to be the murderer. A lot of the reason I purchased this series was due to originally being from England, so for me, it was the added delight of being able to see ""home"" and the different culture to the US.

This is a domestic ""whodunit"" in the great tradition of this genre. But with all the production values upgraded and refined. The several principle characters are revealed as the story unfolds. And this is very much a character based story. Which requires very fine acting and a believable dialog.  There are several suspects and a dozen clues; several possible reasons for the boy's death; and  suspicious goings on in the background. All of which combine to make a very gripping story.

Broadchurch is an exciting series, quickly adapted for FOX's ""Gracepoint,"" with Tennant still in the lead role, sans Scottish accent. But, to be a really excellent series, Broadchurch writers are going to have to make sure that Tenant's detective has a firmer hand in solving the who-done-it mystery.

Characters behave in unrealistic and implausible ways, the writing is weak and filled with a ridiculous amount of surprise tragic backstories from every single murder suspect INCLUDING the culprit, the pace is slow, major evidence introduced in the beginning of the show is ignored for the entire season in favor of chasing random suspects around until they confess said tragic backstory and the search moves on to someone else, the main female cop is consistently portrayed as weak and naive, overly emotional and incompetent, and ultimately all these traits are used to mock her overall competence and ability to do her job in identifying the killer. It's clear that none of these writers have ever met a teenage boy, much less done any reasearch into a real investigation involving pre-teens and their pre-teen friends. (""I have a new friend now"" JUST SHOVE A FORK INTO MY EYE this is TERRIBLE WRITING).

Cops behave with so much routine incompetence and in some cases corruption (paying! a witness! for testimony! lololol) that in the end they have to be spoonfed answers. All along you're treated to weepy montages of teary-eyed families reacting emotionally to things while earnestly soaring music plays, and/or the vicar makes an impassioned speech, and/or someone who may or not be a sex offender protests their innocence (play sex offender bingo on this show, have fun!). And things sure do look dramatic but what's really happening is that NOTHING IS HAPPENING.

At one point the show treats you to a closeup of a foot squashing a slug. Yes, that happens. Don't be deceived. That slug is you, the viewer, and that foot is this show's nonsensical moralistic attempts to tell you a murder mystery that doesn't even end in a proper whodunnit case solution, just more melodrama and a new puddle where your brain used to be.",1410998400,14,1868,4.908227848101266

The investigation should then center on all phone, internet, and GPS data belonging to the boy, his friends, and all suspects. All his friends should have been interviewed.

Don't really understand how there will be a season 2, given the outcome of this series, but to say more would be a spoiler.

5583028,5,B00BEEKN26,"Although I didn't go away for Labor Day, this was the perfect holiday get-away.  A trip to Broachurch, England.  I'm an avid book reader and very rarely enjoy a tv show over a book.  This, however, is that exception because watching this series was like curling up with a great book - not a good book but a great book.  The acting was low-key and just so realistic. (I'm embarrassed to admit that my knowledge of British tv watching was limited to Downton Abbey but I must say there's something relaxing about watching a British program.  There's no loud overacting - just actors acting ""normal"".)  I thought the storyline would be a predictable mystery but it wasn't.  I was rivited to the very end.  Also, with it just being seven episodes, there were no ""filler"" episodes that are normally in episodic tv.  There's very few light-hearted moments (though Olivia Colman can through some good zingers) so be prepared to settle down and be engrossed in a rarity - a great novel in television format.

Also, I see where Fox TV is debuting the American version this month with David Tennant in the same role and it will be interesting to see if it can recreate the chemistry of Broadchurch.  David was fantastic but so was Olivia and the other supporting characters.  I believe the English setting and culture brought an additional layer to the show and provided the glue in the chemistry.",1410307200,3,1386,4.681818181818182

This could have easily been yet another disturbing and cliched show about the death of a child but rather than rely on the one dimensional awfulness of the child's death, here they dig deeper into how it affects those left behind to figure it all out. Since the focus is the perspective of the investigators we experience with them the terrible balance of emotional restraint with doing an impossibly hard job. There is enough comic relief to get through it that neither trivializes the story (or characters) but in fact enriches the personalities of the characters. Life's most awful experiences can be tinged with humor - and I don't mean gallows humor, but the kind that makes the characters more real. The ending has a believable twist and the final scene left me blubbering on the sofa.",1410307200,,838,4.7465753424657535

I could not believe that they actually pulled that ending out. I hated it. It was purely a headline grab. Pure disappointment. The series was absolutely brilliant in every way, story telling plot twisting on the edge of your seat anticipation! Right up to the end. I had guessed every other character was the awful person who had commuted the crime. Then he was revealed, and it was the reason that got me. I just absolutely despised that ending.

This the most realistic portrayal of what happens to a family when a child is murdered. There was not one scene that was unrealistic or hinted at overreaching. The setting is spectacular and filmed with a deft touch. You are immediately transported to the English sea coast and become a voyeur constantly amazed by every outdoor scene.

But the heart of this series is the sensitivity in which each actor assumes their roles. For eight episodes you live with the two frustrated detectives working the case, the heartbroken family bearing an incredible loss, and a dozen secondary townsfolk delicately woven into this mystery. The script is magical in the way it creates suspicion and doubt about certain suspects and then smoothly guides you to considering their possible guilt or innocence. I have to say the ending was a shocker. The treatment of the last episode was marvelous and clever, tender, and insightful. I have been living in this town and now have front row seats in this tragedy which I have never seen so well acted.

That said, we liked it but having now watched it, I wish we had waited through the 90+ people at the library as it just isn't good enough to ever rewatch even if I forget the ending.  The pros:  Beautiful, beautiful filming.  Lovely scenery.  Acting for the most part was excellent. Many parallels among various characters that commented on human nature and how everyone has their secrets.  Cons:  I did not expect the season to really be one long episode so was surprised to get to the end of the first show and not have a conclusion.  If the show had had a different ending, I would have rated it much higher.  After sticking with the initial couple of episodes it really picked up interest, however.  The ending was just not believable to me and for that particular ending I think the acting of the guilty character was not realistic during the season.  He or she just would not have been acting like they did during the rest of the show. I was expecting more of an Aha!  Of course, that makes sense kind of ending.  Instead, I got a Are you kidding me?  That would never be the answer.  In summary, worth watching but not worth buying in my opinion.",1408579200,,1323,4.360655737704918

5583061,3,B00BEEKN26,"Not as good as many have made it out to be. An excellent cast does not make up for lackluster writing. The first episode was great and despite a nonsensical conclusion the last couple episodes were good.
What didn't work: It was 3 or 4 episodes longer than necessary. There is entirely too much time spent watching people staring into space ""grieving"". Almost nothing happens between episodes 2-5. I disliked almost everyone in the lovely town of Broadchurch and one of the few characters I liked died due to screwed up circumstances. I felt nothing for the grieving family, their acting was fine but the writing lacked something. The town seems to consist mostly of two faced suburban nut jobs.
What I did like: I liked the characters played by Olivia Coleman and David Tennant. The fallout Ellie will have to deal with and Alec's backstory are far more interesting than the story explored here. Arthur Darvill was good but he didn't have much to do and I mostly referred to him as Rory, couldn't help it but hopefully he'll have more to do in the next installment. Coleman and Tennant were absolutely excellent and the only reasons I watched through the entire series, ten stars for them.
I bought this because I caught it on sale and I really love David Tennant and I'm hoping the second series is better. And if you haven't heard, Fox has made their own version called Gracepoint.

I enjoyed many of the little side stories also, which really helped fill in the small town tapestry.  But the underlying overuse of classic stereotypes was frustrating and, ultimately, ruined the show. At some point it just becomes a Russian roulette to see who is the paedophile (despite the statement in the first episode that there was no evidence of any!) which appears to be based solely on classic stereotypes such as 'works with kids' 'priest' 'child of paedophile' and 'stay at home dad'.  I know Britain is generally a bit obsessed with paedophilic ""who done it""s but I really thought it had moved beyond the stereotyping, which is in many ways detrimental to society and generally boring and predictable to watch. I hope the American version delivers a more nuanced story.",1408320000,3,953,4.987421383647798

Hooks:
1. Child murder.
2. Gossipy townspeople leading to falsely accused fellow townsperson committing suicide, of course. Hard to find any likable townspeople - hang 'em all.
3. Muckraking, dirt digging newspaper reporters both in town and out of town feeding the tabloid headline frenzy to pin-it-on then hang anyone with a sordid past.
4. Half the town gets exposed for sordid past mistakes, of course.
5. Sex perversion and sexual infidelity.
6. Incompetent police with their own personnel issues of course. It's becoming the current cheap writers hook these past years of alcohol, bad relationships and past mistakes haunting our second chance detective.

5583122,4,B00BEEKN26,"If you're fond of those grim Nordic mystery mini-series like The Killing and The Bridge, you're sure to like Broadchurch, which resets the genre in a little British coastal community. A boy is found murdered on the beach. It takes eight episodes to find out whodunit, and why. And in the meantime, the townspeople are torn apart with suspicion and fear. An ill police inspector is given charge of the case, and manages to alienate just about everyone. The plotting and pacing are nearly perfect; so too the performances and cinematography. My sole caveat, and why I wouldn't give it 5 stars, is the ending. It's akin to a winning marathoner tripping in the final twenty yards and crawling across the finish line. At first blush, I was liking seeing the aftermath of the arrest. But then, too many endings, too sentimental at the end, and one horrible scene that had me saying, ""What in the world were they thinking?"" Would any police office in a first-world country let the murdered boy's father into the jail all alone to confront the killer? Oy, what a stupid piece of writing in an otherwise very smart show.",1405036800,,1111,4.702564102564103

I was completely absorbed by the drama and the depth of emotional reality portrayed so convincingly by the cast. It is astonishing how good the best television can be... and this show significantly raises the bar for me.

In some ways the plot and the character studies follow the well-worn pattern of village murder stories of a Miss Marple, but that comparison does a huge disservice to writing in this series. The overall effect is not unlike a modern Jane Austin novel as regards character observation somehow combined with the plot twists and false leads of an Agatha Christie.

It held my attention from start to finish and had the typical surprise ending that one would expect. The characters were well developed and played their parts perfectly ! It has always amazed me how actors can jump from role to role and be so convincing in their performances. DCI Foley's driver was superb in her role as the passed over detective sergeant who had to accept a new supervisor who was an outsider to the small resort seaside village of Broadchurch. She brought the series to a new level of achievement, I can't imagine anyone doing it better ! In the way of minor criticism, I thought the film may have been a little lengthly, but it probably appeared that way to me as I was a glutton and wanted to enjoy all the series at once, so had a couple of marathon evenings of being mesmeried by this entertaining story.

5583159,5,B00BEEKN26,"The quiet, peaceful seaside town of BROADCHURCH is rocked by the murder of an 11-year-old local boy. Nothing will ever be the same as secrets are revealed and everyone becomes a suspect. BROADCHURCH is storytelling at its extreme best. A talented and diverse cast and a gorgeous setting with haunting music and stylish photography make this stunning series unlike anything else on TV.
Alec Hardy (David Tenant) and Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) team up to solve the murder of Danny Latimer. Although serious crime seems rare in BROADCHURCH, it does seem to have a large police department who are unaccustomed to murder cases. The peace has been forever shattered as just about everyone in town, except for Hardy and Miller, are suspects. The young handsome church vicar has a secret as does the local news agent. What about the mysterious Susan Wright, the town loner who lives in the caravan (trailer) park by the sea? This is British crime drama at its best with a cast of delightful character actors, whose every expression and every line on his or face tells a story. BROADCHURCH is refreshing as we have ""ordinary"" people instead of the usual attractive male cop falling for the gorgeous female cop. The show is about real people that any of us see in our day to day life.
Writer Chris Chibnall has created a real gem of a story. Twists and turns keep us addicted to the story as just about everyone becomes a suspect as their secret pasts are revealed. The story can be compared to the Salem Witch Trials in the US as hysteria grips the town and anyone with a suspicious ""past"" is hounded unmercifully. And we often learn that some people have a legitimate reason to hide their past.
This is a great cast and I was particularly drawn to Pauline Quirke as Susan Wright. Her mystery is written on her face and she is hiding something but what? She owns a lovely dog and as an aside, her real life dog plays her dog in the show. A bit of great casting and a gorgeous dog.
Beautiful photography and a stunningly gorgeous setting are their own are enough to make this show very special. Add in a very beautiful and haunting soundtrack and BROADCHURCH is a winner on all levels.",1403481600,,2177,4.61340206185567

She delivers the perfect counterpoint to his character and imbues her character with a depth of veracity and character that isn't found very often in TV.  In fact, the entire case is deserving of kudos for bringing to the screen seemingly real people...warts and all.

At 6 hours, the length of the series allowed it to present the effect of the crime (and of the media's sensationalizing of it) not just on the principal participants but on the whole community, in a way that is seldom seen.  Production values were up to the standard we have come to expect of British television - the acting, camera work, editing, etc., and the music composed for the series contributed even more to my enjoyment of the series.  The setting, a small harbor town on England's Jurassic Coast, with the high cliffs and at times turbulent seas, only added to the sense of drama.",1402272000,,740,4.548872180451128

5583179,2,B00BEEKN26,"I recommend buying just one episode.  If you aren't really enjoying the first one, trust me, they don't become better.  I usually love BBC shows.  I don't care one way or another about Tennant, and I suspect many people are stating the negative reviews aren't helpful merely because they have a crush on him.

The show was bogged down in lots of slow-mo.  So many undeveloped characters.  Motive, execution, reveal of crime were thoroughly unconvincing.  I agree with what most 1-3 star reviewers wrote about it.

I add another objection: the female lead.  I don't consider myself a strong feminist, but I was disgusted with her character's performance.  She loses the top job to a man who is so sick he can't undergo surgery to fix his problem.  Yet he easily physically outruns her, and outdoes her in physical presence throughout.  They are running down the culprit, and of course it is her cellphone that rings, and she stops to shut it off giving the culprit the opportunity to push past her.  Instead of showing she is fit for the top post by working harder to solve the crime, she simply exchanges snarky comments with the man who got the job.  The male detective, an outsider, is in hospital twice yet he still out-performs and out-thinks her to solve a crime in her own home town.  As is emphasized in the story line---she is too close and is too trusting of all her very nice friends, relatives, and neighbors.  At the end, she stomps and kicks the bad guy, says she wants to kill him, but later leaves town and runs away, abandoning the once again available top spot--stereotypic female dramatics.  A thoroughly depressing showing for the ladies--nothing inspiring here.  It is just too easy to depend upon a weak female lead for plot tension.  I'm so surprised BBC used that well-past-its-time crutch to bolster a crippled plot.

And one more thing I don't see mentioned yet: the terrible music. It is so easy to take for granted good theme music and scores until one's ears are hurt by really poorly matched music.
I literally RAN TO TURN OFF THE MUSIC AT THE END OF EACH EPISODE. I love all types of music but the music used here has nothing to do with bolstering the show's atmosphere or helping to set the scene.",1402099200,9,2228,4.620865139949109

now enjoying..

Brilliantly written and directed, with extraordinary performances - led by the marvelous Olivia Colman and the gifted David
Tennant- this mystery kept us spellbound throughout.

The only quibble I have with it, and the ONLY possible reason for doing an American version of it is that , like TOO many
contemporary moviemakers who wave the banner of realism proudly, they forget that viewers need to HEAR what the
actors are saying at all times, no matter how ""private"" their whispers and asides are supposed to be.  If they insist on
these hushed conversations, they should include subtitles for those of us who are not ""in"" on their script..

Nonetheless, this is SO good and of such high overall quality that I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a
gripping mystery drama told to perfection ..",1401753600,4,936,4.942675159235669

David Tennant shows his acting chops by playing a hardened detective who has a sordid past with another case. Rounding out the main detectives is Olivia Colman. I knew her from the comedic, ""Peep Show"" and was curious as to what her character would be like. I was shocked at how well of a diverse acting ability she has also. Olivia's character makes you feel at ease with her kindness, opposite of David Tennant's hardness.

The cinematography, musical score and cast are just amazing. Coupled with a story of ""Who did it?"", you can't help but get wrapped up in all the happenings of each of the town's populace.

Starting from the get go you meet a flurry of characters and ultimately to the puzzle of the town. A child has died and everyone is a suspect; Could it be a member of his family? Perhaps a budding journalist looking for a piece to right? Possible... could it even be the town's priest? You'll have to watch to find out but through out you won't be let down.

5583206,2,B00BEEKN26,"I am a fan of British mysteries in general, and have no problem with slower-paced series that take time to develop characters. But this particular series was very padded, predictable, and ultimately very disappointing. I guessed who the murderer was almost immediately and I'm not brilliant. The two leads are very good, as is generally the rest of the cast, particularly the actor playing Jack, who has a couple of very good scenes, and the actress playing Susan who is a complex character.

The bickering between the two lead detectives is the best part of the series, and I would watch a Season 2 because of this, in hopes they create a better mystery for it.  The problems with this season are as follows: Too much time is spent on the grieving parents who have predictable reactions (a la The Killing season 1). The newspaper side plot was not very interesting. The fact that the dead boy was a friend of the lead female detective's son would have immediately been a conflict of interest and I doubt she would have been allowed to stay on as a lead investigator.

The detective work is weak, and the behavior of the villain is not believable. They fail to follow up on promising leads just because the series needed to last for many episodes, and everyone in town needs to take turns acting suspiciously each week.
Finally, despite the series initially being very circumspect regarding the boy's body in comparison to your typical gory American CSI-type show, they recreate his murder in a flashback that is gratuitous.",1400371200,8,1524,4.765151515151516

Olivia Coleman is not the same Olivia we're used to (at least in America); the usually gorgeous, dashing David Tennant (the last ""Dr. Who"") becomes a worn-out, beat up, middle aged cop, totally defeated by a screwed-up life.

These characters become people you feel you really know, the dialogue is that believable, the acting is that good - in fact SO good, you can look into the actors' eyes and know what they're thinking or what they're going to say next, something you can only do with real people in real life.  I taped the rest; it took several DVDs, one got damaged, I never got the first episode so I just caved in and bought it - never regretted it.

5583215,4,B00BEEKN26,"""Broadchurch"" is an excellent mystery with red herrings and side stories. It is tragic, with intersecting lives seemingly doomed to unhappiness, The acting is spectacular all round, and I mean spectacular.

But it only gets four stars for me because it was so drawn out that at one point we almost decided to stop watching it (on TV).

As a Doctor Who fan, it is delightful to see David Tennant in a role so different from the Doctor, and where his Welsh accent is clear. Tennant's character, like the whole Broadchurch series, is dark and unhappy, for good reason, you eventually find out. It does get a little old when week after week (when watching it on TV) there is no goodness and light anywhere to be seen.

But if you stick with it, you will see what hells we make for ourselves. And that is riveting.

The story slowly builds a tangled web of what could have been a simple killing by a reasonably obvious suspect into a tangled web of characters (virtually all with their own problems that could contribute directly to the case). They also make it clear they intend this not to be a one-and-done season show, but rather an on-going series with future direction perhaps yet to be determined. The continuing refusal to divulge just what all ""went wrong"" in Hardy's previous assignment (in some different location) seems to signal this intent. They are doing just fine thus far - I wish them well for the future.",1399075200,,1157,4.732673267326732

5583250,5,B00BEEKN26,"Great acting here abounds and the script is taut and gripping, though - nodding here in agreement with some others - the denouement seemed a bit...random after all that intricate careful plotting.  Nevertheless, it's TV drama of the highest order.

David Tennant and Olivia Colman are brilliant as others have duly noted (though you might need subtitles for Tennant's often impenetrable Glaswegian burr), but the excellence extends throughout the large cast.  Notable performances include Jodie Whittaker, who I've adored since 'Venus,' and her on-screen husband, Andrew Buchan, whose sneering countenance as the murder victim's father makes you never quite decided about his innocence.  That's no doubt by design.  He pulls it off magnificently.

The best performance of all: David Bradley, who you've seen...everywhere (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones), as Jack Marshall, a.k.a., 'Broadchurch Jack,' an ultimately innocent man, tried, convicted and discarded like chum through the tabloid press.  It's Jack's tale where creator/writer Chris Chibnall's script reaches its apex.  Real life and its onscreen screen partner have never seemed so interchangeable as it does in Chibnall's hands at that moment.  Stirring stuff.

Coming soon: the American adaptation of Broadchurch featuring...David Tennant.  The series has been renamed 'Gracepoint' and will take its place on Fox.

5583262,5,B00BEEKN26,"I love British mystery series (and Australian ones too!) and have posted quite a few reviews of them here on Amazon. Those who have read my reviews know that I try to avoid spoilers.  After all, it wouldnt be a mystery if you knew too many facts before watching a film or series.  This is especially the case with this terrific new DVD from eOne. The 8-part mini-series aired on BBC America (which I don't get) and is now on DVD.  So far, its ranking as my favorite British mystery of 2014.

The series was filmed in 2013 and (from one of the bonus features I learned that filming too from August to December 2012). There are eight episodes, each of which runs 45 to 52 minutes, since this was made for the commercial ITV network. So the whole series runs about 6 1/2 hours.  Though you can watch each episode at separate times, there are a few that almost require you to watch them together, because of the suspense. Im not suggesting that you binge watch all six hours (though I guess you could) but I will suggest that you watch at least two at a time and  - to get the full emotional effect (and it will have an emotional effect on you)  you should watch episodes 7 and 8 together. And, because British commercial TV is more liberal than US networks, there is brief strong language and brief partial nudity.\

So here we are in my third paragraph and I haven't discussed the plot or the subject. Well, I can tell yiou this much: In a small community (Broadchurch) of 15,000 people on the coast of England, an 11 year-old boy is found dead on the beach (death caused by strangling). A detective (with a problematic past) comes down from Scotland to handle the case with a local female detective.  (All this happens in the first five minutes so its not a spoiler.) Over the next 59 days (thats story line time, not viewing time  which is 6 hours) the two try to solve the murder.  This has always been a quiet and close community but nearly everyone has a secret.  The acting is so good that youll really have a hard time determining who the real killer is. And the script throws in lots of surprises. But, in the end, as I thought back over the clues that were revealed, it all made sense.  And I have to say the music added a lot.
The DVD has a few special bonuses but, for probably the first time in the reviews Ive posted, I cant say that they added anything.  I guess the main reason is that the series draws you in so well that you really don't want to know how they filmed it or to see the actors out of character. The first bonus is the now-requisite behind the scenes featurette. This 27 minute bonus starts off with the first rehearsal where the actors are interviewed in a large, and VERY noisy, room, and you can hardly hear them.  And, as I said, they are all out of character which bothered me (it may not bother you). The other bonus is a series of deleted scenes. These are not long scenes  often less than a minute  and they are grouped by Episode number and total 27 minutes. Not only, did they not add anything to the story, but the images in these deleted scenes had a very light contrast in the image (as compared with the final images in the program). And, lastly there is the Trailer.

So there you have it. I hope I have encouraged you to seek this DVD out and, yet not spoiled any of the enjoyment by telling you too much.  This  for me  was an undiscovered gem of a series>

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5583263,5,B00BEEKN26,"I didn't know anything about the series except that it was highly recommended and new (the eight episodes of series I were shown in 2013 -- a second series is in the works). So when the first episode ended and the mystery was unsolved, that was when I first realized that it would take all 8 episodes to bring this riveting show to a conclusion. The acting and setting are wonderful, including the actor David Bradley who plays Filch in the Harry Potter movies. What makes the series so fascinating is the way the characters are developed and the hidden layers of some of their lives get peeled away, revealing stories that are all too human. Did I mention how wonderful the acting is? Except for David Bradley, these were not actors I knew, but I was mesmerized by their superb characters, especially Olivia Colman as Detective Seargent Ellie Miller. and David Tennant as her partner and Detective Inspector. A very gripping series of episodes, with a complex but believable plot and satisfying conclusion. Highest recommendation!",1397260800,,1031,4.863636363636363

5583266,4,B00BEEKN26,"My reaction to this series is the same I often have with highly-touted British offerings: the casting and acting are superb, the design and production values are impeccable, the cinematography is magnificent, and the moment-to-moment dialogue is exquisite...while the story itself is somewhere between so-so and rather bad. I really can't find fault with so much of this show, but by mid-way through it I had soured on the pacing and plot turns, and while Broadchurch never sank to the exploitive depths of grief porn that, say, the American version of The Killing did, I confess I was somewhat less interested in prolonged examination of the murder's effect on the victim's family as I was in solving the case in the first place. The twist at the end I didn't really care for -- I thought it was too pulpy and sensational. Many of the actions of the lead characters didn't quite make sense to me, and I found the angst and health crises of Tennant's character really overblown and distracting. But, as they say, aside from that....The British are so good at casting, production, dialogue, etc. -- when will they learn to once again tell a story that is coherent, focused and makes complete sense? I have no idea. Anyway, all the good elements in this effort make up for much of the failings of the story -- it's more than just okay, but not as good as it thinks it is.",1397088000,,1369,4.637860082304527

5583273,4,B00BEEKN26,"I loved this series but was a bit disappointed in the ""whodunit"" ending. To play fair with the audience, a few clues suggesting the murderer's guilt should be provided throughout the script rather than suddenly being revealed after the detective has arrived at the solution. I also wondered, how did the killer repeatedly gain access to the place where he met with the victim? He had a key in the big flashback scene, but how did he obtain it? If this was explained, I missed it.

British TV series have one big advantage over American ones--in British productions, average-looking women are allowed to be cast in major roles and to serve as the character the audience identifies with. Broadchurch is an example of this. In America, the female lead always has to be so beautiful that she's almost a freak of nature.

5583277,5,B00BEEKN26,"A young boy is found murdered on a beach. There are many suspects, but no solid evidence.

For most detective shows, that would be fodder for one episode. But in ""Broadchurch Season 1,"" it's only the beginning of a slow-moving, intricate case that ripples through the lives of everyone in a seaside town -- leading to the reveal of ugly secrets and even death. David Tennant and Olivia Colman give astoundingly subtle performances as reluctant police partners, both of whom are troubled by the ugly underside of Broadchurch.

Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller (Colman) is outraged when she comes back from vacation and discovers that the the Detective Inspector job has been given to newcomer Alec Hardy (Tennant). But she doesn't have time to focus on that, because the body of a local boy, Danny Latimer, is found dead on the beach. He's been strangled, and someone in peaceful little Broadchurch is responsible.

Since Miller has lived in Broadchurch for years and Danny was a friend of her son's, she's reluctant to see his friends and family as suspects. But in Hardy's eyes, everyone is a potential murderer, and the few clues that the investigation has turned up begin to slowly point at several people.

As the weeks go by, Danny's murder haunts his fractured family and threatens to drive them further from each other, even as they reluctantly accept some good news. And with no idea who committed the crime, the people of Broadchurch begin to suspect one another of the murder, unearthing ugly long-buried secrets and lies. As time begins running out to solve the murder, Hardy puts his own life on the line to discover who the culprit is.

""Broadchurch"" is set up in a very different way from most murder mystery shows. While everything revolves around Danny's murder, the focus is not just on Hardy and Miller trying to figure out the crime... but on how his death and the murder case affect everyone in Broadchurch. It's a small community without many violent crimes, so the crime touches the life of everyone there, exposing every terrible secret that they have been hiding. Affairs, sex crimes, alcoholism, and so forth.

So rather than just following Miller and Hardy, the show pays attention to how the interlocked web of Broadchurchites are doing. In particular, there's a focus on Danny's grieving family, which splinters under his loss. But the story spreads out over several other people -- Danny's former best friend, the vicar, a thuggish creep, a trio of journalists hunting for a breaking story, a kindly old man, and many others.

But that's not to say that the murder investigation doesn't get much attention. It's a bit more realistic than pat solve-the-crime-in-one-hour mystery series -- the story stretches over several weeks, with a cluster of baffling clues that point in several directions at once. At times you wonder if the detectives will figure out what is happening at all, because at times it seems like nothing short of a miracle will give them anything concrete.

And like the crime itself, the solving of it has some terrible effects on the detectives. Tennant gives a beautiful, understated performance as Hardy, a man beaten down by scandal and loss who only wants to prove that he can solve a crime. He's so determined that he literally puts himself under deadly strain to solve the case, because he is so desperate to overcome his ugly past.

And Tennant has wonderful chemistry with Colman, who plays Hardy's opposite in every way -- Ellie is a kind, good person who has a loving family and believes that the people she knows couldn't have done this. But the investigation strips away that innocence, and reveals to her that -- as Hardy tells her -- everyone is a suspect. No one is safe.

""Broadchurch Season 1"" has some of the usual contrivances of TV murder mysteries, but the subdued character studies are what make it really enjoyable -- especially with Tennant and Colman in the lead roles.",1396569600,,3942,4.8614008941877795

My wife and I watched the entire 8 episodes in 3 nights. I would have preferred to have spread them out over a longer period of time so as to keep the series from ending too soon, but each episode ended with such suspense, that it proved too difficult to wait even a day to see what would happen.

I love murder mysteries and this is by far, the absolute best. I watched the first three episodes on a very long flight and loved it so much I PAID to watch the remainder of the series. I don't pay for movies. We have cable and a number of premium channels included in our package. I just wait for them to come to HBO or something. This was so good, there was no way I'd wait. So many murder mysteries are ""formula"" and I have them figured out or give a good guess well before they finish. Not so with this one. I also find the BBC and traditional Hollywood projects often take a type of political ""side"" and then preach about it sometimes not artfully in their movies or series. Not so with Broadchurch. There were moral lessons, but none of it in-your-face. They were woven so well into the storyline that you didn't know you were being taught something. So well done.

Broadchurch does not rely on violence or shock; it is instead a brilliantly acted, well plotted, season long mystery. The format of the show is one season-one crime.

5583339,5,B00BEEKN26,"review for the series as a whole:
British TV is good for TV police dramas like Morse and now Broadchurch. In this world of jumpy video cuts, all the camera work is very slow. It takes in everyone's expression and their time to react. I think as a whole the series is deliberately slow to force you to witness the effects it has on everyone as the suspicion and hearsay run rampant in the vacuum until the killer is apprehended.

All good detective shows generally have a flawed main character to provide intrigue and backstory. this is no different, David T plays this well. without getting sentimental. The slow camera work works well with the lives of quiet desperation in British suburbia/coastal town. And as the lies, deceits and denials come to the surface. It allows time to take in all aspects of what is going on without giving away who is the murderer.

It touches on many sensitive subjects and the town is forever changed for them. Yet hopefully more real for it.

If it is remade in America, it would remind me of the Jesse Stone movies a little in general tone.",1391990400,,1075,4.530927835051546

What wonderful acting, what a gripping story, and what excellent accompanying photography,music, and editing.
I had no use for David Tennant in Dr. Who (sorry Who finatics) , but he was wonderful in this. All the supporting cast were up to snuff as well.  If you love British mystery dramas at all...this will be on your ""top of the heap"" list for sure.",1391904000,4,594,4.5514018691588785

I want to be entertained as well, and escape a bit from my own awkward situations and life. For instance I can tell that Breaking Bad is an expertly done show, but it's painful for me. But that's one reason why I loved Broadchurch, it felt more real than any other police drama out there yet the situations, mystery, and drama were enough outside of normal life experiences that it was still entertaining to watch. I've loved David Tennant as an actor ever since Doctor Who and he did an expert job of changing his character to be a convincingly morose and gruff detective. Make no mistake that these episodes are wonderfully crafted but it's a slowly building tension, there isn't action at every corner.

Excellent acting by all involved, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the music establishes the atmosphere perfectly. It's the kind of show that creeps into your bones and sticks with you.

In his Doctor Who days I do not believe there was an actor in the U.K. who had more appeal that this man. Forget Daniel Craig, forget Gerard Butler, forget the Redgraves, the Neesons, the Radcliffes! The corner of this guy's right outer canthus had more sparkle than all of the above combined. His: ""You're beeeeeautiful!"" to any strange new alien species, his contagious grin when he saved the day, his magnificent outrage towards his enemies: these were the actions of an actor at the height of his physical and theatrical powers.

That David Tennant is long gone. The David Tennant in this is unrecognizable. It's not that he lacks gifts as an actor;  it's that he inhabits a character with so little charisma you can't wait to be shut of him.

5583372,5,B00BEEKN26,"The makers of this series deserve a resounding round of applause, a standing ovation, for the care, sensitivity, creativity, and consummate virtuosity that went into making this series. UK Detective Series are a personal favorite of mine, but there is normally some aspect that makes me wince, whether it be gratuitous sexuality or language, an unrealistic characterization, or a preachy story line around political correctness. None of those things are present here.

And wonder of wonders, the subject of religious faith is treated with respect, something one can rarely find in any media presentation these days.

Olivia Colman's performance is always deeply nuanced, and this role called upon all her acting resources to portray this complex woman of high integrity dealing with issues that would slay the best of us. She is 100% believable and creates a living, breathing personality -- someone you'd like to know and share life over coffee with. I want to see everything she has ever done. David Tennant is also brilliant as the scraggly, quirky, irascible DI Hardy.

The story line is compelling and original and I was not sure of the resolution until the last few minutes, as suspicion falls on most of the characters until almost the very end. I often lose interest the moment the mystery is solved, but this series kept its magic for me right up until the very moving and satisfying last few minutes, and the mood lingered long after the credits rolled.

Not all questions are answered, but that's just how life is. They never are. Paraphrasing DI Hardy (and echoing my lifelong belief), ""People are unknowable. You can never truly know the heart of another human being.""",1390521600,4,1681,4.992857142857143

5583395,4,B00BEEKN26,"I post this after seeing the first episode.  One of the nearly unique attributes of this story is that there is a character, DS Ellie Miller, who brings an intimate connection between the people of the small town (including her own family) and the police investigation.  If you happen to be a person with an open heart who has suffered a similar loss (the death of a child), watching this series may tug on deep things inside you.  Also, whoever wrote the sections regarding the family of the victim knew fairly, or had reasonably researched, how they would be feeling, what they would be doing ... and this hits home in several ways.

After seeing all eight episodes, four stars: some of the production seems quite good, some hovers around average; while the story in orbit around the yet-to-be-solved crime is mostly well done, there are some foibles - more than a few details of real police work would have been quite different; in the way they were presented, the core moments of the crime itself don't seem that plausible.

If the same production team does a second season, I would watch; perhaps give five stars if they read some of the criticism of the online viewer comments in a positive manner and avoid some of detracting issues mentioned.",1389571200,,1250,4.689497716894977

Many become suspects, and just when you think you know who the killer is, the story shifts, and a new suspect emerges.  It makes you think about how well people really know their neighbors.

Not only are they not the impossibly perfect looking clones that Hollywood creates, but they are filled out with realistic feelings and everyday jobs.  The key to this exploration of the impact of a murder on a small British town is that the writers and director treat these realistic characters in a way that moves the story and makes it the television equivalent of a page turner.  My wife and I tried to only watch one episode a night but would look at each other at the end of an episode and agree to watch 'just one more'.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

5583435,5,B00BEEKN26,"The best way to sell ""Broadchurch"" is to describe my experience of watching it. It was alongside my sister and her boyfriend, and we were completely riveted throughout all eight episodes. We raced through four episodes on the first night, and the remaining four on the second, with the time in between spent speculating on suspects, motives, and red herrings.

Broadchurch is a serene and popular holiday destination, where everyone knows everybody and nothing out of the ordinary ever happens. Then the day comes when Beth Lattimer wakes up from a strange dream of her eleven-year old son Danny standing at the cliff-top above the shoreline. The morning commences, with her husband and daughter going about their business, and Beth assumes that Danny has already left for his paper-round before the rest of the family were out of bed. It's not until hours later that she realizes he never turned up to school, and when word reaches her that a body has been found at the base of the cliffs at the beach, she knows instinctively that it's him.

Newly-arrived DI Alec Hardy and long-time resident DS Ellie Miller are chosen to the lead the investigation, the latter having just been passed over for promotion in favour of the former. Ellie's aggravation over this is soon put on the back-burner when Danny's body is found, as she is badly shaken over the fact that she knows the Lattimer family well, and that her own son was friends with the deceased boy.

Played by David Tennant (best known as the Tenth Doctor on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B008KHIKWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, though you'll hardly recognise him here) and Olivia Coleman (who outshines even Tennant as a woman you can instantly identify with) the two are initially antagonistic to each other despite their visible effort to be cordial and professional. As the series goes on, their animosity eventually grows into mutual respect, and the trajectory of Ellie's character in particular is wonderfully plotted: she starts as a woman who hates to think the worst of anyone, to someone who can effectively take charge and form suspicions over nearly everyone in town.

But the real star of the show is the community of Broadchurch. Make no mistake, this is an ensemble piece, and the murder itself is more of a framing device used to explore the town and its residents. Key to the show's success is that it is not simply a whodunit, but also a character study of a grieving family and a shell-shocked community, where everyone has some sort of dark secret and a different reaction to the murder. Parents are scared for their own children, whilst business-owners are annoyed that they're losing income. Various members of the media swarm in to take advantage of the tragedy, and a few creepy residents are given the stink-eye by the rest of the community. A psychic approaches the family for reasons that may or may not be mercenary. A priest uses the death to fill the near-empty pews in his church.

At the centre of the maelstrom is the Miller family and our two investigators. Blunt and world-weary, Hardy hates the town and its people, but considers it his penance for an unspoken screw-up in his past, whilst Ellie finds it increasingly hard to suspect her fellow townsfolk as potential murderers. In the Millers we have an exquisite portrayal of family grief as they grapple with the death of their son/grandson/brother, and several of the show's most powerful moments ignore the ""whodunit"" aspect entirely and simply focus on how a little family tries to pull itself back together after being torn asunder.

But the real treat is that every single character, no matter how awful they seem at first glance, will have at least a few moments when the audience understands or sympathises with them. Even staple characters like journalists, psychics and rubberneckers, all of which you'd expect to be wholly unsympathetic, have more layers than to them than you'd first assume.

There are a few false notes: it seems high unlikely that a man of Hardy's scruffy appearance and obvious medical issues would be allowed to run such a high-profile investigation, and the police in general come across as less than competent most of the time (and not in a forgivably realistic way either). They fail to bring in obvious suspects, the media uncovers most of the pertinent information for them, and ultimately the solution falls into their laps rather than get uncovered by their detective work.

But for the most part, everything is just compelling: the characters, the setting, the setup, and the myriad of various subplots which provide the necessary twists and red herrings that every murder-mystery requires. The horror of a child's death is offset by the general beauty of the environment, and a sensible balance is struck between the portrayal of the family's grief and the police hunt for the killer. Even the supporting characters are fully fleshed-out individuals, each one with their virtues and foibles. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman lead the entire cast in what is ultimately a depiction of grief: for children, for past mistakes, for lost opportunities, for the past and future.

It all makes for totally engrossing television, one filled with rich storytelling and wonderful performances. I guarantee you'll be thinking about it for days afterwards.",1388793600,,5403,5.068616422947132

5583438,4,B00BEEKN26,"Pros:
This TV series is a very well written and very well acted murder mystery that is engrossing, never boring, and will keep you wanting to watch more.  You will feel like you are really there, at a small English seaside town, amongst real people who are dealing with a horrible tragedy.
Cons:
The story is ultimately dark and creepy with hardly any bright moments.
While the tale that unfolds makes all of the characters interesting human beings, the plot is very complicated, with almost everyone being a suspect, so do not start watching this series with the thought that you might be able to solve the mystery before it is revealed.  Also, the series has a fair amount of strong language, which seemed natural in context, but may offend some viewers.",1388793600,2,756,4.71969696969697

David Tennant is incredibly strong in this one as the head detective. He is haunted by his past failures and his health is bad.  The lead actress is very good too.  This about the murder of a  teen boy. And it takes six episodes till we find out the terrible truth. But the show is never boring.

I could not wait to get back to it.  It is like a good book waiting for you to return.  Granted, it is a dark tale, but it has incredible acting and scenery, and it keeps you guessing until the very end. I am really hoping that there is another season.

5583446,5,B00BEEKN26,"In Broadchurch, David Tennant sheds his Doctor Who persona for that of a grumpy police inspector who joins the police department of a small seaside English town just as the body of a murdered 11 year old boy is discovered on the beach beneath a dangerous cliff. In a suspense filled eight episode mini-series, the closely knit community becomes consumed by the murder investigation which shocks the townsfolk out of their cocoon of false security. Almost everyone is a suspect, a problem exacerbated by the fact that everyone has their own secrets. The investigation is also complicated by meddling news reporters, a police department unaccustomed to murder and the inspector's shaky past and fragile health.

The writing and acting in this series are both brilliant. This is a masterful who-done-it that never ceases to confound and keep the viewer on his or her toes. The writers avoid the use of gratuitous violence. The suspense is first rate, and this is a must-see for mystery lovers. Besides Tennant, there are a number of other brilliant acting performances, led by Olivia Coleman as the detective sergeant who is beloved in the community, and who is also the mother of a child who was a close friend of the murdered boy. Jody Whittaker, Andrew Buchan and Charlotte Beaumont are amazing as the mother, father and sister of the murdered boy, and strong performances are delivered by virtually the entire supporting cast, including Arthur Darville (Doctor Who's Rory Williams) as a young vicar, Pauline Quirke as a scary trailer park lady, Will Mellor as an amateur psychic, David Bradley as the elderly proprietor of the news agent' shop, Jonathan Bailey as a young reporter for the local paper and many others.

There are two minor criticisms of note. Firstly, the accents make it hard to catch all of the dialogue for those of us not accustomed to the various British regional dialects, but this wasn't really a major problem, and if it is, the video comes with the option of subtitles. Secondly, viewers with any familiarity with police investigations will have to suspend their disbelief about one of the leading investigators being so close to the deceased and his family in defiance of any notions of conflict of interest, but the story, writing and acting make it worthwhile to do so. For me, this was the best that new television had to offer in 2013 and a reminder that there is still outstanding television to be found. If you love mystery without all of the blood, gore, slashing or shooting, you have to check out this series.",1388534400,,2545,4.875288683602771

5583449,5,B00BEEKN26,"The best part of this crime drama from the U.K. is that it continually questions the truth, not only of who killed an 11 yr. old boy in the small, idyllic, town of Broadchurch, but of who the people are that make up the town.  At first we only see the lovely exterior of a quaint seaside village and slowly, with each episode, the series tears away at the outwardly perfect exterior of the town and its people and we see the many truths unfold before us.

The truths of the townspeople are what draws us deeper into the story.  We are like the lead detective, DI Alec Hardy, played by David Tennant, who do not know that pasts of these people and so are able to be objective while solving the crime.  Then we find out that even Hardy cannot be completely objective because his past is catching up with him and he has made a promise to the family of the murdered boy that he may not be able to keep.

Each episode we learn more about what was really happening in the town at the time of the murder and we experience many smaller truths while DI Alec Hardy, DI Ellie Miller and the rest of the police force assigned to the case investigates the motives of the various suspects have for ending the life of a young boy.  What we learn throughout the series is that nothing is what it seems.  There is much more than meets the eye and as soon as the story brings us close to apprehending a suspect the evidence leads us into a different direction.

5583470,2,B00BEEKN26,"This series was recommended to me by a friend who knows my love of mysteries, especially British mystery series - books and TV. I've almost always got a mystery novel going, but really solid mysteries on TV are increasingly hard to find. I was excited to hear about a new mystery series that was getting such good buzz. So I was very disappointed when I didn't care for it at all.

The show got bogged down showing the aftereffects of the murder: lots of slow-mo footage of the parent's grief/rage, happy family togetherness time, detectives staring moodily out at the sea, the grief-stricken mother tearing at her hair or clawing at her face or attacking her car with flailing arms. I admit that I am not very sentimental, but there really is a LOT of this stuff and the ""mystery solving"" bits are almost an afterthought.

There is some promising character development with the two primary detectives but it ended up being too simple to be very gratifying. He's a troubled outsider with a dark secret in his past! She's TOO CLOSE to the investigation! The reminders of these issues get very heavy handed after a very short period of time, and it was difficult not to see that yes, indeed, these two detectives were doing a rotten job of solving anything. In the end (possible spoiler alert), the only reason they catch the killer is because (s)he gets bored and essentially surrenders. If that had not happened, I doubt they'd have convicted anyone.

The motive for the crime is just plain dumb. It makes no sense - they could have made it less ridiculous by offering more context for the killer's reasoning and motives, but then they'd have given things away too quickly.

At one point one of the main detectives is singled out by the press as the Worst Cop in Britain, and by that point, I had to agree. My husband and I watched the whole thing, hoping there would be some redeeming qualities here, and there are: the scenery is quite nice.",1387670400,18,1943,4.606936416184971

5583473,2,B00BEEKN26,"I loved Tennant in Doctor Who, don't know that I was expecting the same sort of humor, knew going in that this was going to be a pretty serious piece.

Still and all was expecting decent characterization and interaction with other good actors in the show.

What I found instead was a series, where the main character had screwed up his heart (they take most of the season to explain that), falls down at the drop of a hat and as soon as anything gets really interesting, as in romantic entanglements, he passes out and not in a least bit comical way.

The whole season is about a small village and a single albeit nasty murder.

The only really likeable character comes in late in the season (he's hanging around, but gets a decent episode to himself), who's a local boy scout leader with a decent backstory.  Sad episode, but well acted and enjoyable.

For what it's worth, you do get closure by the end of the season, even if it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense with what you know of the characters involved.

If you're looking for the hyperactive, fast talking, humorous Tennant, go watch WHO.  This rendition, the guy walks on eggshells and has a woebegone ""Oh my's the world has been bad to me, feel sorry for me"" vibe.",1387497600,4,1227,4.4222222222222225

I would even go so far as to say it's better than ""The Killing"" in that the ubiquitous red herrings are at least a little less far-fetched here and the acting is better.

The support cast are uniformly pretty bad, particularly the three direct family members and the three press members (big thumbs down to Ollie). Oh, and special shout out to the vicar and his lousy sermons. This series could have been two hours shorter if every second shot was not in slow motion. I get it. It's dramatic. If that was not enough message there's the Muzak. And there is always that one line gives it all away pretty early on. Too much misdirection.

5583485,3,B00BEEKN26,"We wanted to see what David Tennant was up to post-Who, and the answer is that he's doing a great job portraying a tortured detective assigned to a seaside town to investigate a child's murder. Most of the others in the cast are also performing at a high level. I would be giving the show a higher rating if there were some more relief from the bleak portrayal of human nature, but there is precious little, in fact there is a distinct downward trend in the first five shows, which is all we've watched. We will finish the season to see if the writers are going to resolve the investigation or else drag it out and have the townspeople descend into cannibalism following their current trajectory.
I freely admit I have a bias against well-crafted nihilism; convincing the audience that life is not really worth the trouble does not seem to advance the human condition, which is experiencing plenty of suffering in the ""real"" world.

Update after end of Season 1:
Yes, this investigation was concluded, all the red herrings brutally cooked and cast aside-- all's fair in murder... No cannibalism, but the friendships in the town got a good trashing, and the two leads barely survived. How will Season 2 be, besides bleak? We will likely never know, if the bleak streak continues; we'll watch the reviews closely. I would not recommend Season 1 to parents who let their kids have some freedom to come and go in the neighborhood.",1387065600,3,1426,4.681274900398407

5583507,2,B00BEEKN26,"Sadly, this series is bloated, bland and not worth the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get to a highly implausible ending.  David Tennant is wasted in a dull one-note role.  Some of the other actors are quite good, but their excellent performances are undercut by heavy-handed camera work and a mind-boggling amount of slo-motion.  (We got to the point where we just started fast-forwarding through the pointless slo-mo, lingering views of the sea and montages of each member of the grieving family.)  There is a moment of genuine emotion and tension in the first episode in which Beth is shown in silent slo-mo running to the beach. After that, the slo-mo is just an obvious device to stretch what should have been no more than 4 episodes into 8.

 As a view of small-town life, it really doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. Yes, we get it.  The seemly tranquil small town harbors all kinds of secrets.  Other films and series have done it much better.

As a detective story, the series is particularly frustrating largely because there isn't a lot of detecting going on.  The detectives sort of stumble from one suspect to another, never bothering to follow up on obvious leads until the 7th episode.  Another annoying problem is that series can't seem to settle on a coherent time line.  We are told in the later episodes that nearly two months have elapsed (with VERY little to show for it on the detection front) and yet the detectives are still asking people if they saw the dead boy ""in the last month.""  Important decisions that have been resolved in one episode are treated later as still unresolved, even though the time that has elapsed would have rendered the decision moot.  (Also, if a CCTV tape loops over itself, erasing earlier footage with later footage to save on tape, why is the earlier footage still available to the detectives, but not the later?)

Among the many other annoyances that seriously undermine the series are little things like Tennant's facial hair.  How is it that this man, who we are to believe cares little for his personal appearance, carefully trims his neck and beard to exactly the same degree of scruffiness for 8 weeks?

In short, don't bother.  Or, if you decide to invest the time, keep your finger near the fact-forward button so you can skip thorugh all the filler.",1385856000,15,2334,4.720987654320988

Yes, there is a murder, and the solving of it is the central thread. But Broadchurch is a full dramatic tapestry, with fine subplots and side stories about the inhabitants of the town and how their lives are affected by this murder. Along the way, there are numerous red herrings and inviting alleys that turn out to be blind in the end. The writing and acting are superb. And the setting, thankfully, is a sunny seaside town, rather than a dreary, continuously rainy Seattle. I hope the Blu-ray, which contains additional commentary, is released in Region 1 format. The DVD is not yet in Region 1 format either.

I know a U.S. remake of this is planned, with Chris Chibnall as producer. I hope he can catch lightning in a bottle twice.

5583542,5,B00BEEKN26,"For those of you needing exceptional British drama while waiting for Downton Abbey to return, I'd like to HIGHLY recommend this series (8 episodes).  We just finished watching it via Amazon.com.  Excellent acting, riveting storyline.  It kept me guessing who the killer was until the very last episode.  I avoided it for a long time because I had read reviews that said it was very dark and disturbing, and solving the murder of an 11-year-old boy is dark, however the BBC didn't make it graphic for shock value.  They treated the story with respect, unlike a lot of American crime dramas that go for gross-out factor and ""jump"" scenes.  This story is about the effects the murder has on a small coastal community and the secrets of its citizens which are revealed during the investigation.  There is just no obvious motive for his murder, so therefore it's difficult to rule anyone out as a suspect.  The drama is so realistic that I was not aware I was watching a television show.  The brilliant  and talented actors look like everyday real people, not pretty plastic Hollywood types acting at being believable everyday people.  The emotional scenes, especially a few by the victim's father, are painfully realistic.  BBC dramas never let me down.",1384041600,,1249,4.867298578199052

The score spoke to me in many ways, and I fell in love with it so much that I later bought the soundtrack on iTunes. Broadchurch was an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life, and was possibly the best television series I've seen in my lifetime.

5583565,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch is the story of the murder investigation of an eleven-year-old boy named Danny Latimer, whose body is found on the beach early one morning.  DI Alec Hardy played by David Tennant and DS Ellie Miller played by Olivia Colman investigate over a series of eight episodes.  I'm almost never surprised by a mystery -- I usually guess the culprit right away and when I don't, it's usually because the culprit doesn't make sense.  That's not at all the case here.  When the big reveal happens in the last episode, you are surprised.  They throw a few red herrings in along the way, but about midway through the series I began to understand that if they were leading me toward a suspect, he/she absolutely wasn't the killer.  As the investigation continues, the town seems to fray at the seams and the underbelly is exposed, bit by bit.  I started watching the series for David Tennant because I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who, and he is not the Doctor in this at all.  He is someone wholly new, so if you're looking for the Doctor in different clothes, you won't find him.  Instead, you'll find a flawed man with a tortured past, and you'll desperately want him to find peace.  Olivia Colman is terrific in this too.  She's the heart of this series, and it unfolds mostly through her point of view.  Add to that the gorgeous location shots, and you'll be riveted.",1383264000,,1363,4.563786008230453

5583576,5,B00BEEKN26,"Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast (filmed in Clevedon), ITV's ""Broadchurch"" is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, and the search for his killer. Thankfully, for fans who faithfully followed this compelling show, ""Broadchurch"" will be returning for a second series in 2014! When ""Broadchurch"" was originally transmitted in the U.K., viewership grew so much that by the series conclusion, the producers and writers (who had only intended one series) were compelled to continue.

Series One begins on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother, awoken with nightmares in the wee hours, desperately searches for her son. Later in the day, his body is discovered below the white cliffs. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. The remarkable cast makes ""Broadchurch"" standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there; as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, he brings an award-winning level of intensity and nuance to the part. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, takes this case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal when a previous case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past, and tragedy drives Hardy to solve this new case, despite its effect on his frail health.

Olivia Colman is Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller; she lost out on a promotion to newcomer DI Hardy. She is a good friend to Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (the superb Jodie Whittaker is utterly convincing), and her young son Tom (Adam Wilson) was apparently Danny's friend. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer discovers she is pregnant with her third child, a situation all the more tumultuous after she discovers that her husband Mark (Andrew Buchan) has been having an affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Becca works at the hotel where DI Hardy is staying. Beth turns to her vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill, glad to see he survived a thankless role in ""Doctor Who""), for solace. Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable.

DS Ellie Miller's husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), seems to be oblivious to their son's problems, while trying to support his wife. DS Miller dislikes DI Hardy and his cynicism, and finds the investigation of her community quite difficult to cope with. An unsavory element is the muckraking of journalists. The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), attempts to control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. Jack Marshall (the superb David Bradley, of ""Harry Potter"") faces terrible accusations when his past is unearthed; the actor David Bradley should be far better known. Another suspect, Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) menaces Maggie one evening at the paper. Susan lives on the beach in a trailer, and knows more than she lets on. She has strange relationship with plumber Tom Latimer's employee Nigel Carter (Joe Sims), and Nigel threatens her with a crossbow. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.

No matter how surrounded he is by coworkers and the community Broadchurch suspects, Detective Inspector Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. Just as Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. Aside from a fine cast overall, the show's momentum is provided by its leads. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character from the inside out. Tennant, a remarkable actor, conveys a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, she summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. The last scene, with beacons of torchlight and bonfires shimmering in the darkness along the coast, and Beth seeing Danny's ghost, is deeply evocative. Enjoy.",1383004800,,4190,5.112408759124087

Broadchurch - such a good [short] series.  LOL  I know that British dramas can be notoriously short, but you know what, sometimes that's a good thing!  With just eight episodes to the Season, Broadchurch rope you in, gave you some prospective on what's it like to have major crime in a small town setting where everyone knows each other and how the ugliness of suspicion can reel it's head.

The acting was good.  Di Hardy and DS Miller were two polar-opposites: one standing on the outside looking in, and the other already inside but walks around with prideful denial.  As if to say, ""no one in my town would/could do such a heinous crime.""  To which kept them at odds with one another.

The mystery, the shady characters... had me wanting to speculate who done it, however - I did not fool myself into trying to guess whom the culprit could've been.  I waited and episode 8 was explosive!!!!  I would've never thought that 'person' would have been the one.

And that last episode was powerful enough that it (I'll admit) made me cry!  And I was on the train going home watching the episode!  Ha!

5583648,5,B00BEEKN26,"I think mine will be something like the 462nd review so I wonder what I can say that hasn't already been said and done so in the most amazing ways.  Still, I will go ahead and add my stars to the tab this remarkable series is racking up.  I can't sleep and need something to do.

From the opening of the first episode I was taken in the grip of this drama.  It had me by the throat and punched me in the gut.  I literally couldn't breathe in some parts.  Be warned, most of the time it is so painful to watch.  I cried.  I couldn't help it.  I got caught up in it.  As a parent, I had no problem whatsoever relating to the nightmare unfolding in the lives of the family of the murdered boy. Talk about intense! I started watching as soon as the first episode became available via Amazon's instant streaming but I actually didn't watch each episode as soon as it was downloaded because I didn't know if I could take any more!  But I did continue to watch.  I had to...a saga about each individual in the show was being revealed.  It became more than the effect this death had on the victim's family.  The impact and trauma expanded to every single person in the small community of Broadchurch.

Don't expect any relief or distraction from the horror of the murder of a young boy.  It was sad without any let up.  The music was beautiful and haunting adding to and intensifying the melancholy.  There was no waking up from the nightmare and the sun coming up in the morning.  Which is exactly what I imagine it would be like to live through such a shattering event. There is no happy ending.  The final episode, 8, is a devastating reveal of the murderer and the added devastation it causes. Someone murdered this child in a small close-knit community.  Everyone in Broadchurch is thinking, ""It must have been a stranger that did this evil thing, right?""  I kept thinking, could finding out that the murderer is someone known to this traumatized family make it even more painful? Perhaps. Still, the people of Broadchurch comforted themselves with the knowledge that no one they know could do such a horrific thing and as a beach front ""tourist"" town, the murderer has to be a stranger.  And then...suspicion begins to be cast about...upon locals...we have a front row seat to see what this does...who begins pointing fingers at whom.  No one is left untouched and unaffected by the fallout.  Broadchurch is ripped apart...and so was I.

I loved the writing.  I liked the way the story was told/revealed bit by bit.  I appreciated that I wasn't ""let in"" on who the killer was or even what motivated the murder until the very end.  I got the impression that a philosophy was being put forth.  For me, the ""lesson"" was one of not jumping to conclusions, that appearances can definitely be deceiving; things aren't usually as straight forward as they first appear, are not black and white.  Another thing I enjoyed was how the writing gave us realistic and believable characters doing and saying things that fit their situation.  Yes, at first glance we are only given enough information to tempt us to jump to conclusions but ultimately things made sense.  Peoples' actions and behavior always has a why behind them and the writing did a good job of realistically portraying the why...when it's revealed, that is.  You know, someone says something and we wonder, ""Why"" did they say that?  A lot of the time the dialogue in both film and books, for me, is hugely disconnected between what is said and why a person would possibly say it.  Would they really say that?  It really bugs me when this disconnect happens and Broadchurch had very little of it.

I liked having to unravel the layers of the folks of Broadchurch, myself, rather than having it done for me.  I enjoyed how ""the why"" which motivated and shaped each person's behavior was revealed.  How and why did they get where they were in their lives?  Some sins do indeed have long shadows and they don't necessarily have to be our own sins.  So, how do people live through, get beyond, and even overcome events in their lives?  There are a lot of walking wounded.  And they abound in this program. Some programs are pure escapism, not this one. It's a drama, a tragedy. It is not a typical crime procedural (I believe that is the term.) I didn't think that this show was mainly about solving the murder.  It was mainly about how the murder effected the family and then in a ripple effect every other person in the community and further.

I was transported from my sofa into the community of Broadchurch.  I became a neighbor and emotionally connected.  By developing the characters over several episodes there was a greater depth to everyone.

I can't find fault with any of the acting. It was completely top-notch.  I am a huge fan of British programming and I am constantly awed by the degree of greatness in the acting!  These people are good.  They don't get their roles because they look good on camera in jeans without a T-shirt!  I've never followed the Dr. Who series so am not familiar with Tennant in that roll but I thought he was masterful.  He played a mournful and deeply scarred person to perfection.  He was driven in his pursuit of the truth.  I wanted to know what had happened to him that had shaped him. He was an outsider in Broadchurch. He was sent there to solve this murder yet, there was a connection and it was personal, that was made plain, but it wasn't a connection to the victim or anyone involved.  So, what was it?

Now, on the other hand, Detective Ellie (Olivia Colman) was a local.  Her son was a close friend of the murdered boy.  Her family was closely connected to and lived just a few doors down from the victim.  Like everyone else in Broadchurch this was up-close-and-personal. She should have been in charge of the case but was blindsided by having Tennant assigned instead.  To add insult to injury she was forced to endure his rough and insensitive manner toward everyone she had known forever. The suspects were her friends and she began the investigation pretty much unable to even consider that someone she knows could have committed such an atrocity to one of their own. As the story unfolds she begins to see people once so familiar to her in different ways than she did before.  She discovers she didn't really know them at all.  Colman was brilliant.  The emotion she brought to the role was astounding.  She was completely believable and real to me.

It would be a glaring omission not to mention how well all the other roles were acted.  The young murdered boy was painfully beautiful.  His parents portrayed the crippling and devastating blow of losing their son absolutely superbly. You'll see the supporting characters perform their parts perfectly.

At the conclusion we are notified that ""Broadchurch will return.""  For me, I will watch to see what the writer(s) will bring to the screen next.  I would like to see what happens to these folks.  Could I stand to see another 8 episodes of such heart wrenching melancholy? I'm really not sure.  This offering was painful for me.  It was so real. So, in follow-up programming I would like to see something with the intense acting, superb writing but perhaps a little relief from the drama.  I don't need comedy.  I'm talking some breathing room.  A person needs to be able to breathe when a program is nearly 8 hours long.  Anyway, I'll be taking a peek at what might be happening next in Broadchurch.

The rating is appropriate for the content of the subject matter.  There were no scenes of graphic sex or gory violence, (thank goodness!), which is a welcome change of what one normally sees these days in any kind of drama involving murder.  No autopsies or mutilated corpse was depicted.  (The subject matter was horrific enough without adding any of that!) The only sex scene was of the couple after the act and both were either clothed or completely covered. All of these things are something I greatly appreciate because I don't want to see it.  There is mild swearing that I've come to expect in a program of this rating and I think only one use of the ""F"" word at the end.",1381104000,11,8141,4.5687629578438145

Tons of people (both sides of the camera) from both Doctor Who and Torchwood come together and create a new world together. It's not distracting that you know all of these people from David Tennant on down. These are some of the best actors/actresses working today coming together to create an 8-part homicide mystery that has some similarities to Twin Peaks, but manages to be completely unique and original. The writing, directing, acting, music, cinematography are all top notch. It's like watch a movie it's that good (and do yourself a favor and make sure to watch it streaming on Amazon and in HD so you get the full visual quality and not editing/commercials).",1381104000,,766,4.723880597014926

5583673,5,B00BEEKN26,"I put off watching Broadchurch for much too long, because I thought I knew what to expect from a ""whodunnit"" series. Then I watched a few interviews with the actors from Broadchurch about the making of the show,  and was intrigued by the fact that they did not know who the killer was through at least the first five episodes of the series.  This forced the actors to really listen to each other, and be suspicious of others, just as their characters were in the program. Moreover, the interviews showed the actors, writers and directors seemed to genuinely care about bringing a thoughtful perspective and realism to the program.  I bought the first episode of Broadchurch since it was no longer available ""on demand"" for free.  The minute it ended, I bought the other seven episodes.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop.  David Tennant definitely deserved the award he won for acting in Broadchurch, but every other character in Broadchurch was wonderful, realistic, three-dimensional and thought provoking as well.  The first episode does not begin with the discovery of the body, and the final episode does not end with revealing the murderer.  In fact, you know ""whodunit"" near the beginning of the last episode, but there is still a lot left to tell.  This is not some cookie cutter cop show where the audience is just trying to be smarter than the writers and look for clues.  I felt as though I was watching in as real people lived their lives in front of me.  The murder in this small town blows it apart, before finally beginning to bring it back together beautifully at the end.  There were several points where I cried during the show, and it was never because of something shocking gratuitously thrown in for effect; it was because I identified with the pain felt by the characters in the story.  Season 1 of Broadchurch was wonderful; I can't wait for Season 2",1381017600,,1880,4.712538226299694
5583674,5,B00BEEKN26,"Strong, multiple character arcs; tense suspense; exquisite setting; perfect pacing per episode.  This is brilliant on every level.  Olivia Colman and David Tennant lead an amazing cast.  Other multiple episode stories have annoying gimicky red herrings while Chris Chibnall respects our love of strong, well-developed characters---yes, we come to fully believe in the possible guilt of so many even simultaneously, but unlike other stretched story-arcs, we are not tricked but satiated with great stories feeding into the primary story.  Chibnall is brilliant and this is his finest work so far.

5583675,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch grabs you from the opening scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat through all eight episodes. The characters get well developed which is not always the norm for TV. The story and characters are interwoven. You will not see how they are all finally connected until the last few minutes of the last episode.
As a mystery aficianado, I usually guess ""who done it"" well before the end, but I was guessing and wrongly, over and over again throughout the series. The ending was shocking while still being truthful to the overall narrative.
The story was well written and the characters spoke like they were in real life. The actors deserve high praise for drawing us into the world of Broadchurch immediately.
David Tennant threw off the mantle of Dr. Who easily with his first scene, proving once again that he is talented and worth watching in anything. All the other actors were superb. Each one from DS Miller down to the town drunk were spot on and worked together as an ensemble.

5583685,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch was a very good series. A well told story, beautifully photographed, great characters, and wonderfully acted. The drama was tight and kept the viewer on the edge of their seats.

This series was reminiscent of the early 90s, David Lynch, American drama, Twin Peaks. Both series, centered on a murder in a small quaint town with a series of interesting characters, suspects. I preferred BC more because eight episodes compared to 48 was more than enough time to tell the story without it feeling drawn out or overdone. This is one thing, we Americans have recently learned from the British. There is no need to have a bloated 22-24 episodes when telling a story that can be wrapped up within a matter of a few well written and acted episodes.

I am not sure that another series can be done as a follow- up with this group of characters. That said, I am curious to see what happens to Alec, Ellie, and the town folk after the events of Danny Lattimer. I am just not sure that this is material for another extended story.",1380931200,,1030,4.562162162162162

Overall, parts of Broadchurch reminded me of Season 3 of The Killing on AMC and that's not a bad thing.

What surprised me, and maybe that was their plan as a UK show brought to the US, is this wasn't a ""who did it?"" mystery with clues sprinkled in every episode so we, the viewers, could solve the crime.

Really look forward to Season 2 and curious what the Fox version will be like.",1380844800,,624,4.408695652173913

5583700,5,B00BEEKN26,Wonderful acting and character development.  Really digs into how a tragedy can cause people to turn on each other instead of coming together.  Everybody has his or her own agenda and secrets in this story and the story's tension comes from watching them weigh their worth against the greater objective of bringing a killer to justice.  The leads are all strong.  The pace is not as whizz-bang as we Americans are accustomed to.  You have to be patient and let the story unfold and the characters reveal themselves.  It's a very satisfying experience with a conclusion that does not aim to shock but rather to enlighten.  Very moving.,1380844800,,634,4.814814814814815

Prime Suspect was the perfect ""long"" mystery length in this genre; even a two part ""Touch of Frost"" could drag or get overloaded with subplots.

You may wish to view this series using subtitles if you're not familiar with the dialects of English spoken in the series, both from Dorsetshire, where it is set, and Tennant's own thick Scottish accent.

I was so moved by the final episode that I basically shut down emotionally.  I had to - I am the mother of a 10 year old boy.  I will never forget this story.",1380499200,2,306,4.410714285714286
5583725,5,B00BEEKN26,A wonderfully suspenseful murder mystery set in a small British seaside community. Each episode provides building suspense and the plot turns and surprises are so well set up that the viewer is hooked from the very first. Superb acting from the entire cast and the writing and screenplay is crisp and realistic with not a single moment of cheesiness included. Really excellent TV- 8 engaging episodes in the series. David Tennant is wonderful as is Olivia Colman as the lead investigators. I loved this show and highly recommend it.,1380499200,,532,4.98876404494382
5583726,5,B00BEEKN26,"Full disclosure, I really only watched this cause David Tennant was in it. When I realize Arthur Darvill was in it...well... that's just whipped cream, right? And then the story got me. Don't get me wrong. Tennant is tenaciously broody and damaged. And Darvill... well, I was ALL Thornbirding on Darvill's devastatingly passionate priest. But the story really shone through here. Powerfull performances all around. A really gutwrenching story and some inventive direction choices that keep you guessing, even if the ending is a little weak. So, final word, watch for the man candy, stay for the story.",1380499200,,601,5.142857142857143

5583728,5,B00BEEKN26,"This series makes you think.  It was not ""dumbed"" down to the viewer.  It actually challenges the audience to think and develop theories.  I loved the actors....  I loved the plot (not so much the topic, but the way the drama unfolded)....  I loved the development of the characters....  I loved that each character became more than what they seemed at first--a good reminder for not judging a book by it's cover!  Great understated commentary of how complicated life can be and how one persons actions can affect so many.  Another programming plus, IMHO is that the series wasn't dragged out and compromised for advertising or for ratings purposes.  In short, it was a deliciously stimulating visual book:  short, sweet, and to the point.  (Hollywood could learn some from the BBC in this concept.)  My husband and I will be watching it a second time just to look for things we missed in our first viewing!  5 stars+, thumbs up!!",1380499200,,930,4.7375

There's something about the way that this series is filmed, with minimal sound editing, or perhaps maximal sound muffling, that makes your ears focus on the sparse words of the actors and sounds in the room.

The acting is great. In episode 1, I was a bit overwhelmed by the wide cast of characters but they soon sorted themselves out.

5583749,5,B00BEEKN26,"I don't even own a television, and have not for about 13 years, so watching the ""boob-tube"" is not a priority for me.  In fact, most of what I watch is online, or on DVD (I'm a huge film buff).  Yet, Broadchurch is the only show that I actually have paid to watch as soon as a new episode emerged.  The acting is so impeccable, you forget that David Tennant, Olivia Coleman, Pauline Quirke, Jodie Whittaker, David Bradley, Andrew Buchan, Matthew Gravelle, Arthur Darville, Joe Sims, and their co-stars (I honestly could go on--and I don't want to go without mentioning the young actors in the midst of the plot, who are engaging in their own ways) are acting.  While it is an ""ensemble cast,"" each character's backstory (especially what you do not know) will hook you from the get-go.  Tennant and Coleman in particular dazzle in this series--they are rough, emotional, detached, cool, hot-headed, and HUMAN, depending on the situation.
This show may have the classic ""whodunnit?"" genre stamped upon it in some way, but it's thoroughly original, gripping, emotional, and devoted to maintaining suspense from start to finish.  Those who enjoy AMC's The Killing (or who know of the American show) may feel compelled to make parallels, but aside from the basic outline of the story, the two programs have different vibes and heft to them.  It is Broadchurch that made me feel simultaneously attracted to and repelled by every character at some point.  It is Broadchurch that had me refusing to blink, lest I miss a clue, and it is Broadchurch that had me up late each night after every episode, mulling over what I had just seen with as much intensity as DI Hardy and DS Miller.

Particularly refreshing about Broadchurch is that it seldom uses ""bells and whistles.""  This is not a generic, gaudy, fast-paced and high-octane romp through a murder-mystery.  It is a show with a sneaky pacing, one that reflects the haunting and, thus, lingering suspicions that slowly-yet-surely fall atop every resident in Broadchurch.

I'd highly-recommend this show to anyone who loves thrillers, mystery, suspense, BBC productions, and hefty heart-tugging drama.  You will not be disappointed.",1380412800,,2176,4.961432506887053

Everything you think you figured out in the first 10 minutes is going to change for you by the end of the first episode; and each episodeis packed w/ all the elements of a great suspense tail!  The story line, the acting, the true element of surprise is what a great mystery story should be, and Broadchurch does NOT disappoint.  I couldn't wait for the next one and watched each one again so as not to miss anything.  I just wish there were more of them!!!",1380412800,,530,4.313131313131313

5583757,4,B00BEEKN26,"I wanted to watch the entire series before reviewing it. What I came away with was not that this was a particularly caring village shaken by the murder of a young boy, or a study of the effect of that death upon various members of the community--though there is that, but a village in which almost everyone, including children, harbors their own secrets, which are unknown even to those closest to them. As the police investigation unfolds, and the villagers fall under suspicion, long buried secrets, and present ones, are revealed much to the shock of the the community and loved ones, who never suspected anything was amiss. And so, the essential unknowabilty of others, and of their motivations or why they chose to act on their destructive desires becomes the fascinating glue which holds this story together.

Though I long guessed the identity of the perpetrator, the intimacy, vulnerability, rage and shame exhibited by the characters in the final episode was so well done and so very shocking that I actually had nightmares afterward.

Very good script, and wonderful acting particularly from Olivia Colman who plays the kind and sensitive policewoman Ellie Miller. Recommended.",1380412800,,1187,5.082051282051282

5583765,3,B00BEEKN26,"I am a fan of both lead actors and was so excited by the first few episodes. Without giving any spoilers, in the final episode you learn who the killer is and it is the most random gobbledegook I have ever seen.

What makes whodunits compelling is for the audience to be able to suss out the killer or at least who had the most probable cause by watching each new episode. Don't bother trying to figure this one out. The killer in the end had next to no link to Danny and there is no story thru out the episodes that link them in anyway.

The only foreshadowing I can see after watching the series is one statement from one character in one episode.

So if the point of the writer and director was to surprise the audience at the end, well done, I was surprised. But you might as well made the killer Homie the Clown because there was absolutely no tie in.

Loved David Tennant tho!",1380412800,12,882,4.201183431952662
5583766,4,B00BEEKN26,"As the above, I had heard a lot about this series and looked forward to seeing it.  I was not disappointed, as its 8 hour format enabled it to explore the affect the murder has on the characters and the larger community of a small town on the Coast of Southwestern England.  That part was well done. The scene at the end between the two women most affected by the crime was particularly good and unexpected (at least to me).  The plot was full of the usual obvious red-herrings, but at least they weren't incredible as many are in comparable stories.  And, I think, the identity of the murderer was a genuine surprise. David Tennant's character was yet another tortured detective, whose agonies became a little tiresome as the series progressed (why was he still a policeman?), and who it was increasingly hard to sympathize with especially as I couldn't understand half of what he said (due to his thick Scots accent and mumbling).  In fact, the difficulty in understanding the dialog was my major gripe - not the British accent, but the fact that no one talks into a microphone or enunciates clearly, so large swathes of dialog are lost.  But enough remained to render it a very entertaining story.  There is to be a second series, I understand - will look forward to that.",1380326400,,1275,4.615044247787611
5583767,5,B00BEEKN26,This show was outstanding. Fully developed characters and intelligent storytelling made for a fascinating mystery. You weren't able to figure out the culprit within the first episode which is rare! I highly recommend it.,1380326400,,220,5.5
5583768,3,B00BEEKN26,"The series went on and on and on-seemed like the story could have been told in half the time.  Characters over dramatized their feelings, new suspects were pointed out at every episode to keep the interest-did not care at all for the conclusion and the extremely high drama-could have done without the details.  All emotional scenes became very tedious and the actors overplayed their roles in these scenes.",1380326400,3,407,4.970588235294118
5583769,4,B00BEEKN26,"At first viewing, I didn't expect to like this series as much as I finally did. I'm getting wary of those grim, somber dramas, because some of them aren't that good. Also, there's a little too much of the edgy camera work for my taste, and they could have told the tale more tightly, with fewer spinning-camera out of focus medical episodes for DI Hardy. I skipped several scenes in the middle episodes without losing the thread. This story might have been stronger if told in six episodes instead of eight.

That said, I found myself drawn in to the story and it was hard to wait for the last episode to become available. This series is grim and somber, edgy and foreboding, but also rich in characters, local color, and human feeling. I'm still torn between thinking the solution was a bit too pat and pulled out of thin air, and remembering some of the characters the series took time to explore as it wound its way to the end.

A few of the earlier episodes move a little slowly but they were still fascinating in that they showed the interactions of the the members of a close  knit small community grieving one of their own. I have to say I was mesmerized during every episode to the point where I was always surprised when the credits came up! Very enjoyable series and I recommend it.,1380153600,4,402,4.583333333333333

5583781,4,B00BEEKN26,"The problem with all murder mysteries is once you find out ""who done it"" you are in danger of being bored by the ending.  This show manages to suck you in enough to jerk a tear or two out of you after it finally lets you know what really happened to the victim, who the improbable killer is, and what motivated him to kill.

I would say the tone and the acting was great.  These BBC shows (Doc Martin, Kingdom, etc.) are so great at giving you multiple reasons to become entranced.  The towns are incredible to look at.  The people are unvarnished and complex.  The protagonists are not terribly stereotypical.

BBC seems able to convey pathos in these series; American television is less at home with this emotion.  We want to laugh more and be ""entertained."" The UK's sensibility is a bit more nuanced and conveys a wider range of emotions, including darker ones.

I'll link this quality to the interviews I've seen of British actors doing promotion in the US -- one was asked ""how are you?"" and reflexively answered ""great!"" ""amazing!"" ""couldn't be better!""  He went on to explain how in the UK, when a talk show host asks you ""how are you?"" the guest will usually say ""alright,"" in a quiet, half defeated voice.

The rules are just different.

5583782,5,B00BEEKN26,"I can't say too much how much I enjoyed this series. Unlike most murder dramas, this story isn't about autopsies and gunfights. It's about human nature. It's about the tragedy of the murder of a child. It's about the court of public opinion, the sinister nature of irresponsible journalism, the failures, frailties and flaws of our fellow human beings. This is 'Shakespeare writes a detective story'.

Chris Chibnall has now gone to the top of my list as a writer. It was beautifully done. In no way has he broken the cardinal rule of show, don't tell. Nor has he made the horrible mistake of creating any perfect character. All of them, from youngest to oldest, are wonderfully imperfect human beings, and with no character is this more obvious than our protagonist, DI Alec Hardy, masterfully played by David Tennant as the world-weary detective with secrets of his own and a shadowy past. He is so wonderfully written by Chibnall and executed by Tennant that we find ourselves won over by a character that on the surface is quite unlikable. Tennant's performance has, IMO, overshadowed his role in Doctor Who with this work. He has proven before that he's far more than the Tenth Doctor. With his Hardy, he made me forget about all other roles.

Olivia Colman, too, is wonderful. Her character enjoys a growth that's wonderful to behold. Colman is as good as any actress out there. I've seen her before, but with her Ellie Miller, she has captured me completely.

In fact not a single actor or actress was badly chosen. From eldest to youngest and male and female, all of them turned in sterling performances. Even the dog! I was especially pleased with Arthur Darvill. Young Adam Wilson, who played Tom Miller, was quite impressive as well.

This series is what TV should look like. This is what The Killing should have looked like. This is TV at it's finest. The story arc was magnificent, centered, not on procedurals and junk science-based CSI (actual CSI is nothing like what's shown on TV) but on the tragedy of it, and how that tragedy bled into the lives of the people of Broadchurch, itself, even the ones investigating it. The dialog was wonderful, especially the banter between Hardy and Miller, whose polar-opposite natures should have been cliche, yet were pulled off masterfully by Colman and Tennant. Hardy's subplot was simply divine. We find out why he is so world-weary, yet, in the end are still left with the mystery of him, and know he is Broadchurch's greatest mystery still. Little touches, like the 'love thy neighbor' signs add further richness and poignancy and lend the tale yet more humanity. Rich in character development, beautifully photographed, the series ended in a perfect denouement. And the best part is we are left wanting more, which is the mark of a truly great story.",1380153600,16,2811,4.813664596273292

The characters are complicated and layered, as are people in real life.

I like the treatment of news reporters in this series. There are three of them, with differing agendas. You can't really say that any of them is bad or good, and their conflicting motivations are shown.

5583833,5,B00BEEKN26,"Love seeing the relationships of all of the townspeople in this mystery series. It feels authentic - giving you the sensation that you're not watching a show but watching the events unfold in real time. When 11-year-old Danny disappears and his body is found on the beach of this small seaside town in England, the town is devastated. Everyone seems to know his parents as his dad is a popular plumber in town. You meet the police, the reporters and local newspaper editor, the hotel staff, the pastor, the teacher, and neighbors. It unfolds slowly and each week there are new discoveries.

David Tennant plays DI Alec Hardy who is gruff to the point of rudeness. He is riveting. He is assisted by DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) who thought she was going to get his position. The relationships are complex in this film as they are in life. This isn't a gruesome story, but it is poignant as it involves the death of a child. It is tastefully done.

5583844,5,B00BEEKN26,"Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast (filmed in Clevedon), ITV's ""Broadchurch"" is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, and the search for his killer. Thankfully, for fans who faithfully followed this compelling show, ""Broadchurch"" will be returning for a second series in 2014! When ""Broadchurch"" was originally transmitted in the U.K., viewership grew so much that by the series conclusion, the producers and writers (who had only intended one series) were compelled to continue.

Series One begins on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother, awoken with nightmares in the wee hours, desperately searches for her son. Later in the day, his body is discovered below the white cliffs. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. The remarkable cast makes ""Broadchurch"" standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there; as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, he brings an award-winning level of intensity and nuance to the part. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, takes this case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal when a previous case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past, and tragedy drives Hardy to solve this new case, despite its effect on his frail health.

Olivia Colman is Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller; she lost out on a promotion to newcomer DI Hardy. She is a good friend to Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (the superb Jodie Whittaker is utterly convincing), and her young son Tom (Adam Wilson) was apparently Danny's friend. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer discovers she is pregnant with her third child, a situation all the more tumultuous after she discovers that her husband Mark (Andrew Buchan) has been having an affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Becca works at the hotel where DI Hardy is staying. Beth turns to her vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill, glad to see he survived a thankless role in ""Doctor Who""), for solace. Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable.

DS Ellie Miller's husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), seems to be oblivious to their son's problems, while trying to support his wife. DS Miller dislikes DI Hardy and his cynicism, and finds the investigation of her community quite difficult to cope with. An unsavory element is the muckraking of journalists. The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), attempts to control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. Jack Marshall (the superb David Bradley, of ""Harry Potter"") faces terrible accusations when his past is unearthed; the actor David Bradley should be far better known. Another suspect, Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) menaces Maggie one evening at the paper. Susan lives on the beach in a trailer, and knows more than she lets on. She has strange relationship with plumber Tom Latimer's employee Nigel Carter (Joe Sims), and Nigel threatens her with a crossbow. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.

No matter how surrounded he is by coworkers and the community Broadchurch suspects, Detective Inspector Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. Just as Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. Aside from a fine cast overall, the show's momentum is provided by its leads. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character from the inside out. Tennant, a remarkable actor, conveys a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, she summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. The last scene, with beacons of torchlight and bonfires shimmering in the darkness along the coast, and Beth seeing Danny's ghost, is deeply evocative. Enjoy.",1379548800,7,4190,5.112408759124087

5583847,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch starts out a bit slow but quickly comes up to speed.  Each of the characters are people who I could easily identify with.  I love the normal everyday look of the homes and the people.  The story line is interesting, it lets you in on the family lives of the characters and their connections to the victim and keeps you guessing to the very end.  All in all, I would have to say it is well written, well acted and even the musical score is just right.  I can't wait for the next one.  I certainly hope they keep the same caliber of realistic and believable actors and setting. If the BBC can put out a program as good as this I may just have to subscribe to the BBC/America channel on cable just to see what else is out there.

5583865,5,B00BEEKN26,"I first heard of Broadchurch while watching previews on Xfinity.  It seemed interesting enough to give the first episode a chance, and so I am now anxiously waiting for Episode 7 to air.  Broadchurch is an excellent crime drama.  The setting is realistic, and the characters well drawn and well developed.  The acting is top notch, as well, as British acting tends to be.  What is especially well done is the various ways in which the parents, sister, and grandmother of the murdered boy grieve for him.  As the storyline unfolds, viewers learn all sorts of interesting tidbits and secrets about the characters and their lives.  The writers have thus far presented the viewers with several plausible murder suspects, and very few residents of Broadchurch are above suspicion.  The contrasting personalitites of DI Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller, played by David Tennant and Olivia Colman, offer a great balancing act to the approach of handling the family, the media, the suspects, and the case.  Tennant and Colman are the anchors of this cast.  Broadchurch hits the ground running in Episode 1, and moves at a pace which keeps viewers engaged.  As this is a mini-series, the case will be solved and explained by the end of Episode 8, although given the quality of the acting and the writing, many viewers will probably be left wanting more Broadchurch.",1379376000,,1351,4.907488986784141

The lead actors, especially David Tennant and Olivia Colman, act their pants off as a disgraced DCI assigned to Broadchurch as punishment for a botched-up murder investigation and the resentful DS who was passed over for the position.  Yet these two come together to investigate the murder of a local 10-year-old boy.  Small town dynamics, secrets, resentments, are all uncovered while investigating this crime.

5583879,5,B00BEEKN26,"Real people, real homes, real problems, no Hollywood, no glamour, no famous actress playing the lead. It is so believable a story that you get quickly and easily sucked into the whodunit theme you CANNOT miss a single episode. And every time you believe that the show is getting a bit stale, something incredible changes the storyline or the possible suspect in the death of an 11 year old boy.

I am so glad the British do not try at all to emulate American TV shows because they usually have the best and most interesting storylines, characters and mysteries, than I have ever seen or enjoyed more.  At first I found myself addicted to Orphan Black, ANOTHER great BBC story, I believe produced in Canada.  Was hanging on every episode then, only to find myself drawn back into yet another classic story.

Being a Doctor Who fan (from 63 - present) I did not just start watching BroadChurch because David Tennant was in this, though I must admit I didn't think I could take him out of the Tardis and into a Police Office, but he worked it.  Not only do you not get ANY hint of his Doctor Who persona, but he literally reinvents himself into this new DI Officer who is so believable that I do not think about Doctor Who at all while watching him.  Only a truly great actor can pull off something with that strong of a tie-in to a singular famous BBC TV Character.

Kudos to the Brits and I hope we see even more of these kind of shows in the future.

Michael",1379116800,,1479,4.388278388278389

What you see is actors who know their craft and how to tell a story that is compelling and relevant.  I grow tired of our American TV series that leaves nothing to the imagination and insults the intelligence of the viewer.
Amazon offered the first episode for free and after watching it - I immediately bought the series.

5583948,5,B00BEEKN26,"Although I've only seen the first four episodes so far, I'm enjoying this series tremendously. Great cast, great acting. It's a bit slow-moving at times, but the point seems to be not so much to create tension and drama leading up to the solution of the mystery, but to show the impact of a tragic event on the life of a small, remote, peaceful community. Not sure what the premise will be going forward if a second season is produced. Will there be one murder per series as in this one? It's a bit unconventional as most of us are used to one or more per episode in whodonit series. But so far, it's working. The longer time frame allows for the deeper, underlying themes to be developed more, and hopefully, a good, credible, surprise ending.",1378339200,,744,4.477941176470588

5583951,5,B00BEEKN26,"I went into this show expecting a standard police procedural that just happened to have David Tennant in it. Boy, was I taken by surprise.

Focusing around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a quiet sea-side town, Broadchurch follows not only the investigation into the boy's death, but the fallout to the entire community. A media circus ensues, and mob-mentality leads to further revelations and consequences.

The show starts slow, reminiscent of the heavy focus on the anguish over Laura Palmer's murder in the first episode of ""Twin Peaks"", but as the investigation continues, the time spent with all of these characters really pays off and allows us to be invested in their stories. By the time the season ends, it's hard not to feel something for everyone involved, which is lost in a lot of procedurals thanks to the standard 1-case-1-episode format that has characters coming and going all of the time. Here, we're living with these people for all 8 episodes. We know them. And we suspect everyone.

David Tennant is great here, although written somewhat cliche as the gruff detective with a guilty secret seeking redemption. He gives his character some great (and much needed) humor as his out-of-touch-overtly-serious character is at odds with everyone, even/especially our other protagonist, Olivia Coleman's DS Miller. He really is an amazing actor, and he elevates what would have probably been an abrasive and annoying archetype otherwise.

Coleman is the real star of this show. Her character is the emotional backbone of the series, as we see her initially naive and trusting nature (a product of the ""perfect sleepy town"" mentality) continually challenged by the revelations of the investigation. She's a detective who's never had to deal with investigating a murder, let alone the son of a dear friend. She knows the killer will be someone she knows, and that fear is gut-wrenching.

No spoilers, but the story is surprising. Thankfully the plot doesn't revolve around a huge twist, but suffice to say it isn't predictable in the slightest.

I'll stop there. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a more dramatic and emotional investigative drama than the average show. I'll just warn that it's very heavy, despite the occasional funny bickering between Tennant and Coleman, and is not for anyone looking for a ""fun"" show.",1378339200,,2352,5.048969072164948

5583958,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch tells the story of the investigation of the slaying of a young boy in a close-knit community, and the ensuing trauma to the family and friends. It depicts the uncomfortable fact that everyone is a suspect until they're eliminated from suspicion. And, as in real life, many people seem suspicious because of their alibis or lack thereof.

The father of the deceased child is not a sympathetic character. I don't like him at all and feel that the writers can't redeem his character in any way. The mother is in so much emotional pain and has no one to turn to.

The detectives investigating the crime are an unusual partnership. The male partner is brooding, on-the-edge and carries a lot of emotional baggage. The female partner is a happily-married wife and mother. (Her son was a friend of the slain boy.) The detectives' antagonism toward each other slowly dissolves as they struggle through their differences. They manage to work together in spite of their differing approaches to solving the mystery.

The writers do a good job of plotting the progression of the investigation, and don't skip over the emotional trauma caused by the murder. There are several ""bad guys"" in the community and each impacts the investigation in some way. The cinematography is excellent and the outdoor scene locations are breathtakingly beautiful.

Although this is a British series (always excellent) the story is a universal one, and will appeal to almost everyone.",1378252800,3,1464,5.012345679012346

David Tennant of Doctor Who fame, with his natural Scottish accent, is wonderful as the brooding distant DI Alec Hardy. He is an outsider to Broadchurch, getting the job of DI over DS Elly Miller, a town resident. They play off each other quite well as they investigate the murder of eleven year old Danny Latimer, a shocking occurrence anywhere, more so in this small ocean side town where every one knows each other and crime is low. But everyone has secrets and the start to unravel and mistrust begins to build among the residents. If the next half of the series is as great, I will be very happy.

A little soap-operish as everyone in the small village seems to have something to hide.

I bought the first episode, thinking ""OK, if I don't like it, I don't need to buy the rest.""  There is more intense emotion in the first 10 minutes of this series than there is in many full length feature films!  It sucked me in instantly and I find myself obsessing about the characters, their motivations, and the various  mysteries behind it all.  I've watched 3 episodes now, and am impatiently waiting for the next one to air. I liked David Tennant as Dr. Who, but was never as enchanted by him as an actor as many others.

5584042,5,B00BEEKN26,"Broadchurch is a coastal town in Dorset.  On the beach, beneath a cliff, the body of an 11 year-old boy is found.  He has not fallen to his death, but been strangled.  A local psychic (?) suggests that his body has been brought to the shore in a boat.

A local detective sergeant (Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman) has expected to be promoted and put in charge of the case.  However, she is preempted by detective inspector Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) who has been brought in from the outside.  Hardy was in charge of a celebrated, failed case in the past and he has a severe heart condition, which he has concealed from his superiors.  Together they will investigate the death of the 11 year-old, a friend of Ellie's son, Tom.  Their relationship will be both strained and respectful.

The investigation is explored in eight segments (ca. 45-50 minutes each).  By the conclusion, nearly every resident of Broadchurch will become a suspect and a host of subsidiary, sometimes unrelated secrets will be revealed.

This series was immensely popular in the UK and was recommended to us as a `don't miss' by English friends.  It certainly lived up to expectations.  By the final segments we were staying up into the small hours as the series reached its conclusion.  In some ways this is an ensemble cast show; the parents of the dead child probably have as many lines as the detectives.  The performances are all strong, the setting is utilized very effectively and the mystery is compelling.

The writing is not quite of `Endeavour' or `Foyle's War' quality.  It is not as memorable or as profoundly moving as those shows can be.  On the other hand, the plot is strong and your attention never flags.

The `feel' of the show is interesting.  It is not quite Twin Peaksish, but there are several interesting, otherworldly characters and throughout we have the sense that we have entered an enclosed society that has guarded its secrets very carefully.  That, of course, is the standard ethos of the English mystery, but here there is an added dimension, largely provided by the setting and the direction.  The sea is vast, the waves loud, the cliff menacingly high, the town itself relatively deserted (certainly by Dorset standards), the caravans (=trailers) frightening and ominous.

This is strong material.  Would that we could produce such programming as regularly and consistently as the Brits do.

Highly recommended.",1377043200,3,2435,4.880487804878049
5584043,5,B00BEEKN26,"This drama is very well done. The characters, the writing, the filming. I feel like I am there and that is good TV. Thanks for offering it otherwise I would never have had the pleasure of viewing this fine work.",1377043200,,211,4.3
5584044,5,B00BEEKN26,"I am a David Tennant fan. Seriously. I have seen him in various roles, including my favorite, Dr Who. Until now. WOW!!! Not only is this series riveting from the very first scene the actors/actress they chose for these roles could not have been any better. You will, if you watch British TV/Movies, see very familiar faces. The characters in their roles are believable and that's half the battle. They ALL carry it well. It will also keep you guessing. Twists and Turns are common. Not a series to be missed. Really. Don't miss this one!!!!!",1376956800,,541,4.645833333333333
5584045,5,B00BEEKN26,"Honestly, the main draw to want to see this was David Tennant, the much-beloved and much-missed tenth doctor in Doctor Who. But that is not why I rated this five stars. Compelling story (and heartbreaking), interesting characters, beautiful photography -- all of these elements combined to produce my rating.

Not recommended for anyone for whom the death of child is too intense or emotional. (I knew what it was about and cried at the point of discovery and informing the family.)",1376956800,,482,4.950617283950617

And I read somewhere that BBC has done some unusual editing while yours are complete. And, ever since watching Tennant as Dr. Who, I'm a complete Tennant fan and want to see every minute they filmed. It's also a joy to hear him in his ""real"" accent and be amazed by the way he managed to cloak that accent as the Doctor. I'm sure I'll watch this again w/o interruptions once the series is complete.",1376956800,,493,4.369565217391305

5584053,5,B00BEEKN26,"David Tennant is a fine actor. The proof of the pudding is that in this fine mystery he does not come off at all like his incarnation of tenth Doctor Who. Here he plays a troubled, driven detective somewhat out of his element in a small British seaside town

Olivia Coleman, his foil in this mystery is also troubled, though as a longtime resident she's the insider to Tennant's outsider.

While this mystery could be pedestrian, the fine writing and acting have raised it above the competition. I'm looking forward to the next installment!",1376956800,,540,4.73404255319149

5584055,4,B00BEEKN26,Writing well done. Story line slightly confusing at first. Started in the middle of the costar's desire for new job she thought was her's.

5584060,5,B00BEEKN26,"Of course, this TV program is intended for adults or very mature young adults.  What I like best about it is the portrayal of the people involved in both the lives of the murdered boy and those in the town who are deeply affected by the unusual event.

The writing is excellent in digging deeply into the personalities & behaviors of those in the story, while spreading hints of possible illicit relationships the along the way.

Also, the acting is so well done, that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is just a TV story. This is so memorable that we can keep the story & people clearly in mind from week to week & look forward to the next episode.",1376870400,7,656,4.317073170731708

The look and feel of this takes me back to the very premiere of ""Prime Suspect"" in that it presents a trudge through a mundane English coastal town whose social rug is pulled out from under it by an unthinkable act. The local officer compromised by her proximity to the natives with whom she is closely involved, is forced to surrender jurisdiction to a tormented yet determined veteran. Ambitious reporters descend on the town as the press gets word. There is no real list of suspects to be had, only suspicions that gnaw and drive the town to paranoia.

But I need not have feared. Mr. Tennant  made me believe his character right away.
I was transported to this seaside village and felt report with the people in the town. I felt their normal lives just rent  asunder by tragedy.

It starts by introducing you quickly to the main characters which is followed swiftly by the discovery of a death of an 11 year old boy, one of the Investigators ends up Knowing the child's Family and the rest is a roller coaster of emotion and suspense as the suspects start being rounded up.

David Tennant plays a very cut and dry detective for the British Police in a high up position within the detectives of that branch. All this and this was only the first Episode!

Its very fast-paced, engaging, emotionally draining (that's a good thing). The characters are deep, they keep you wondering what their back-story is, and the acting is superb. It did take a little time to get used to David Tenant in this kind of role (after loving him in Dr Who), but after a few minutes he WAS Detective Inspector Alec Hardy.

5584078,5,B00BEEKN26,Tired of reality nonsense during TV summer reruns. Then give Broadchurch a chance. It's a murder mystery but spends about as much time focusing on the devastated community as it does solving the murder. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have fine chemistry as the 2 polar opposite police detectives and Olivia Coleman should be better known in the US. Two episodes in and I'm hooked!,1376697600,,382,4.892307692307693
5584079,5,B00BEEKN26,"Two UK top actors, David Tennant and Olivia Coleman, are at loggerheads from scene one of this excellent tv series from the UK.  She returns from vacation, all set for her promotion to occur, only to discover that an outsider, Tennant, has been given the job instead. Right from that opening scene, you doubt she is up to that promotion as she is obviously caught up in the minutae of her small return gifts for the staff.  He, by contrast, is as serious and obsessed as one can get in police work. But he is also ripe for atonement because of the murder case which got away from him in his past.

When they show up at the murder scene of her neighbor's eleven year old son, this becomes even more evident as he has to restrain her as much as the boy's mother. nevertheless, can she can talk to the people as an insider in this seaside community whereas he is a stiff outsider wholly lacking in people skills.

Your sympathy for her character grows as you meet her husband, whose sole contribution to their household seems to be babysitting their eleven year old son. In short, she carries all the weight of pulling their family along.

The murdered child's family is also brilliantly rendered here, parents, a grandmother and a daughter.

I highly recommend the series.

5584099,5,B00BEEKN26,"There is nothing I can criticize about this show...everything is terrific. Usually, I'm well aware of even minor flaws, but everything from the casting to the directing, the acting to the cinematography, is all beautifully done. The story holds the viewer from the first minute. In a peaceful little town in Britain, where it appears that nothing much ever happens and everyone knows everyone else, a young boy is murdered. Immediately, like a stone thrown into a pond, the ripples spread out to engulf each person and each sector of the community. The actors have that wonderful British look: crooked teeth, wrinkles, a refreshing lack of plastic surgery and Botox, so that they look like real people and you can tell them apart. No lineup of Barbie dolls and stud muffins here! The location is just charming enough to emphasize the horror of what has occurred, and just seedy enough to emphasize that there's more to this than meets the eye. To top it off, a local newspaperman finds himself in hot water as, struggling to get assigned to a major paper, he jumps the gun with the media and a bigger player comes to town. The main protagonists - though they don't steal the scenes but blend in harmoniously - are the new lead investigator, fresh from a scandalous situation in the big city, and the local woman who expected to get his job. Since most folks are friends or relatives (the reporter is the nephew of the female investigator), it seems hard to keep a secret, yet secrets abound. The first episode, without appearing rushed or confusing, manages to bring in a host of suspicious people and events and attitudes. One of the best things about the series is that it is a closed one, i.e. you know in advance that the whole story will be wound up in 8 episodes. That keeps it tight and prevents unnecessary filler, such as the kind found in series which are open-ended. I happen to know the whole story arc, but the acting will keep me glued to the screen for the next 7 episodes. The series has not only been renewed (presumably with a different case to be solved) but American tv is developing a version of it. This is a gem!",1376352000,108,2135,4.591623036649215
5584100,5,B00BEEKN26,I usually don't like to watch shows with cases because of the intensity. I'm am little too sensitive for that but this story really drew me to keep watching.

This is certainly not a light-hearted mystery show. And some of us may need a tissue box at the ready (I did). I have been a huge Mentalist follower, but I believe Broadchurch will take its place when I am up for heavier material.",1376179200,,398,4.527777777777778

5584108,5,B00BEEKN26,"I've long been a fan of crime drama series as well as many UK dramas - Broadchurch looked like just the type of series I would enjoy.

Episode one starts us on our journey with the mysterious death of a young boy and focuses on the various family members and townspeople, each with their own story and relationship with the deceased.  We are also introduced to the detectives on the case, a Detective Inspector who has apparently been recently posted to Broadchurch after some sort of scandal on a previous case, and his subordinate who not only knows the deceased but is already unhappy as she believes that she would be getting the DI job. There is obvious friction there and you wonder if it will hinder the efforts to solve the crime.

The death is suspicious, an ambitious local report leaks information in hopes of getting noticed by the ""big guy"" and the DI is under scrutiny by the big city reporter who shows up in town and seems set on taking him down for reasons we have yet to learn. You get a real feel that just about everyone could be a suspect and it leaves you wanting to see next weeks episode NOW.",1376006400,,1116,4.407766990291262

5584110,5,B00BEEKN26,"I find myself eschewing American TV lately for these absorbingly realistic British series.  The people in this show quickly seem real and transport you effortlessly into being part of their fictional world.  In Broadchurch, the seaside town is a seemingly caring, close-knit small community.  Their warmth and connection to one another is heartening, and immediately puts the viewer on notice that the murder of one the village's children will affect all who live there.  The newcomer is the new DI Alec Hardy, who has taken the spot from his new assistant Ellie Miller while she was on vacation.  References to a dark past make you wonder about his brusque, almost-pompous attitude, and heightens the tension between him and the close-knit police force & neighborhood he has dropped into at the start of investigating the worst crime the town has supposedly seen, the murder of an 11-year-old boy.

I enjoy how normal and non-stereotyped the British actors in this police show are, and the dialogue rings true and succinct.  Also, not having visited, the scenes of this British beach town are a delight to see.  I look forward to continuing to watch the investigation unfold as well as learning the deeper emotional lives of this multi-faceted program.  Why can't American producers use real-looking characters instead of showing us stories populated with character ""types"" and starring ""beautiful"" people of normal sizes and shapes?",1376006400,389,1434,5.1731601731601735
5584111,5,B00BEEKN26,"I bought the DVD for this the day it came out in May, because I did not want to wait 4 months to watch, but I can recommend this series without a doubt.
The most extraordinary story ever, written & produced by Chris Chipnall, one of the top British writers today. A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.

The body of a 11year old boy is found on the beach in Dorset, England. The murder and following investigation create a chain reaction that will tear this small seaside town apart. A town wrapped in secrets, like most small towns anywhere in the world, and they become known as the investigation proceeds. The Murderer remains veiled until the final episode and a surprise and more importantly the reason.
The two investigators, DI Hardy a harden, efficient, and blunt outsider with the reputation for failure - played brilliantly by David Tennant - and DS Miller a sensitive and friendly local - played by the extraordinary Olivia Coleman. The interactions between these two is amazing - some of the best dialog and zingers - like when Miller tells Hardy ""leave me alone or I will piss in a cup and throw it on you."" - Or when Hardy tells Miller ""I pray nightly that you will leave me alone."" The remaining Cast is spectacular - you can actually feel the grief and suspicion coming from their characters. The film is well worth watching or better off buying the DVD if you like great drama and great acting.",1376006400,4,1556,4.537366548042705
5584112,4,B00BEEKN26,"I was fortunate to see all of this ITV broadcast series (8 episodes) not long ago...
David Tennent is brilliant as usual and I'm strongly hoping he'll be back for Series 2 as they're making another Series for ITV which is testimate to how good it was as it was originally devised as a one-off. The Fox Broadcasting Network announced that they would produce a remake of Broadchurch for US audiences to air in the 2014-15 season but I wouldn't expect it will be quite as good and rich with character as this one.
The town of Clevedon just outside Bristol is the fictional town of Broadchurch with a murder of a young boy at the beach (West Bay in Dorset)as the setting... Like all good detective stories, there are plenty of suspects and the series leads you from one to another as the series goes on. Olivia Colman (Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller)and Tennent(Detective Inspector Alec Hardy) play the investigating Detectives at odds over the case... Having mostly Seen Olivia in comedic roles such as Peep Show, The Green Wing and That Mitchell and Webb Look among other parts, I was very pleased to see her skills in a serious dramatic role. Tennent is very deep and brooding in his character with issues that come out over the course of time. I won't delve into any details of the plot.
