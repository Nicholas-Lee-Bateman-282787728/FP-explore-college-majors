2827900,4,B000PSP9AI,"This is another excellent Andre Rieu dvd. Production values are very high once again, and the setting at Schonbrunn is picture postcard stuff,magnificent!! I would have given this 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that this concert didn't grab me as much emotionally as some of the other Andre Rieu dvd's I have seen, and I think it has something to do with the crowd at the the concert, they seemed a bit subdued to me, they didn't really get involved, in most of the other dvd's the crowds really get in to the spirit and are having a really good time. Anyway that's just a minor thing, I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who likes to be entertained.",1182211200,29,655,4.377049180327869

2827905,4,B000PSP9AI,"Wonderful concert, however it is in german, and does not have the usual english translation across the bottom.
My parents are in an adult care facility and come together EVERY afternoon to watch one of Andre's concerts in my mom's room.
I think my 98 year old dad has the entire collection!  They are a tremendous source of joy for my parents as well as the other residents, as they also watch concerts in the common living room/ tv room.  You should see their faces light up when they hear this music!  It's fantastic!  What a blessing these have been!",1402963200,2,553,4.5
2827906,5,B000PSP9AI,"One of the best concerts I have listened to in a long time.  I have enjoyed many of Andre Rieu's shows, but this one tops them all, and I recommend it to anyone who loves the music of the great Johann Strauss, Franz Lehar and other celebrated composers of that era.",1400803200,,265,4.196078431372549

2827908,5,B000PSP9AI,"I love this DVD.  It's just so happy and everybody in the orchestra enjoys themselves. I borrowed this from my Library and every time I felt depressed I would play the DVD.

I decided to buy it as soon as I could

I am very happy to now own it.

2827912,5,B000PSP9AI,"Andre pulled out all the stops on this one. Great venue and a great performances from all.  Ice skating, ballet, folk dancing, carriage rides, I don't know what he left out. :) The only thing I could still ask for would be to record these concerts in HD with DTS Master sound on a Blue Ray disk. That would be fantastic!!",1364256000,,321,4.262295081967213
2827913,5,B000PSP9AI,"I am going to second E. Mariner's review of June 2012.  That review said it all.  This item is not offered very often in Blu-ray format.  I had to wait over 6 months and got it for a reasonable price.  So, when it comes up - don't wait!!",1362700800,3,237,3.875
2827914,5,B000PSP9AI,"If you are a Andre Rieu fan... this is the classic concert to have in your collection. Andre edits all his DVDs and CDs personally...  so you are getting the official stuff.  My only gripe: videos of this same concert on YouTube are in HD.  This DVD is not.  Still, I'm a happy customer, after having seen him live in Buffalo, NY a few months ago.",1349308800,,347,4.212121212121212
2827915,5,B000PSP9AI,"I have never bought an Andre Rieu album that I did not enjoy.  I love his music very much except that he often repeats a lot of his offerings. I always buy my DVD's from Amazon.com because they never let me down on service.

2827916,5,B000PSP9AI,"The first Blu-Ray of Maestro Rieu I have seen -- Amazing.

Visually stunning, filled with the great music and zaniness that characterizes an Andre Rieu concert, with the usual cast of characters. And what better place for his predominant preference in music but Vienna. The marriage of high definition sound and exciting, well-staged visuals makes this an entertainment delight.

Stop reading right now and push the Order Button.

Still here? OK, if you're a concert violinist or have season orchestra seats to any of the great symphony orchestras, the fact that much of the video does not consist of close ups of instruments being played and conductors turning around to bow, may be a turn off, but just for once, enjoy music that was as popular with the populace as say Rap or Hip Hop are or were. (Yeah, bad example) But I took a chance blowing out my entertainment system speakers and getting drummed out of the neighborhood with the volume when some of my favorite set pieces were played.

You are persistent -- Nothing else important in the rest of this review -- just buy it while there still are some left!

Alright -- It's in German. File that under ""who cares"", because the scenes and the usual Rieu theatrics transcend language. The palace, the dancers -- the skaters(!) and the audience. The only place where people watching one of Andre's videoed concerts possibly enjoyed more was in his hometown on the DVD ""The Homecoming"" -- The Viennese seemed to adopt one who honors their music, favorite artist, and traditions as his own, and were certainly welcoming on the beautiful evening(s). It was obviously an EVENT.

What are you waiting for? -- me to lend you the money for the one day delivery? But only maybe if you join with me in begging Andre to publish more in Blu-Ray!",1338681600,5,1788,4.733118971061093
2827917,4,B000PSP9AI,"This is an import DVD in PAL format (not NTSC as described).  It plays on only one of the three DVD players at my mom's house (this was a gift to her).  She likes the DVD a lot, but it is disappointing that it is not in a format compatible with North American DVD players.",1322352000,5,272,3.9272727272727272

2827919,5,B000PSP9AI,"Such a fantastic production, complete with beautiful music, funny bits, and an audience that is obviously very engaged. To be in that audience would have been so incredible.  Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! I don't know what else to say except, if you like Strauss at all, BUY THIS DVD!!",1297555200,,285,4.9375
2827920,1,B000PSP9AI,"A little while ago this whole show was broadcast in two instalments on Dutch TV and because we had really nothing better to do, the trouble and I decided to sit it out. From a purely technical point of view it was a good production. The orchestra looked attractive and involved, the surroundings were great and his hirsuteness himself was at his charming best. Technically, the music was well performed too, no missed notes, no clinkers, the orchestra the epitome of professionalism. But both 'er indoors and me felt as if we had heard and seen this programme, with only very slight variations, many times before. What's more, we seriously felt that, although the music was well played, there was something lacking. The music lacked all substance, it was all outward appearance. It reminded me of a well crafted chair, buffed to a wonderful shine, but extremely uncomfortable to sit in.
Is the endless repetition of Strauss' (and like composers) waltzes and polkas and the so called ""real"" sentiment (heavily underlined by Herr Rieu's mien at its most sympathetic) of the odd tearjerker and the old fashioned vapidness of the humour (the sight of two Teutonic looking acrobats hitting the anvil with fake hammers made us cringe with embarrassment) really what we are supposed to regard as the pinnacle of entertainment? It's inoffensive at best, but not really deserving of the almost hysterical praise that has befallen Herr Rieu and his product. I do not begrudge him his commercial success, on the contrary, I rather admire the way he manages to sell something that no one really needs, but neither as entertainment nor as music does it hold any appeal for me. When you are looking for some serious good classical music, turn to the long established orchestras and maestros (they play a mean Strauss too, much, much better than he of the careful hairdo would ever manage). If you're looking for bland entertainment (but good looks), turn to Rieu and his band of merry musikmakers.",1289952000,3,1983,4.904761904761905

2827922,5,B000PSP9AI,"Outstanding quality of sound and video!
Super excellent program material!

The only down is the lack of 0.1 (Subwoofer Signal)
It was 5.0 instead of 5.1
The other item was, that part of the subtitles were below
the displayed video. So in my system subtitles were unsusable.

2827924,5,B000PSP9AI,"This production is a magnificent art of work, a delightful combination of sights, sounds and joy. Andr is bringing the popular music to a peak of joy, entertainment and delight, mixed with humor and of course the brightness and brilliance of the magnificent orchestra that follows him to the note. The dances, the views of the palace only add to this unbelievable experience. For those who could not attend the concert in person - this is second to best.
I recommend this DVD and can assure that you will not be disappointed.",1264464000,7,525,4.717391304347826
2827925,3,B000PSP9AI,"Schonbrunn is about the best Andre Rieu dvd I had seen. Others had made the same comments so I will not review what is common. What I like to comment on is the DD5.1. The left front channel is almost non existent. The volume between channels is so unbalanced that viewing the concert on 5.1 is just not enjoyable. The DD2.0 audio track is OK and that saved the dvd for me. I watched the entire concert using the 2.0 track and I enjoyed most of the program. I did skipped the 2 segments performed by the guy with the dog as commented by another reviewer.

I could have tried compensating the unbalance using the receiver controls, but I do not want to do that just for 1 dvd. May be the next time I feel like playing the dvd again, I will give it a try to find out if the balanced 5.1 would make Schonbrunn that much more enjoyable.

Am I the only person with the 5.1 sound track problem? I surely would like to hear from others.

The performance, video quality, and program content rated 4.9 stars (the -.1 is because of the dog segments). The 3 star overall is because of the 5.1 unbalance.",1263945600,3,1091,4.235576923076923
2827926,5,B000PSP9AI,"Since this DVD is not available in the U.S., I ordered it on Andre's website [...].  I had been wanting it for about two years.  Have all his other DVD's except La vie est Belle.  The Andre Rieu at Schonbrunn Palace is by far his best DVD including Live in Australia and Maastricht II.  What I enjoyed about it was the variety of music that was used.  On most of his DVD's he plays his standard fare, but this one had many songs I had never heard.  The entire orchestration including the ice dancing was unbelievable.  [...]  It would be a best seller, in my opinion.",1249948800,14,567,4.283018867924528
2827927,5,B000PSP9AI,"Another Andre Rieu masterpiece. The setting, at Schonbrunn Palace. is exceptionally beautiful and the performances are excellent, as is the norm for Andre and his entourage. In many ways this DVD is remindful of the Live In Vienna performance in front of the Hofburg Palace, also in Vienna. Both feature wonderful dancing in the glittering palace interiors but this recording also includes some ice dancing and beautiful pairs figure skating! I find the dancing scenes greatly enhance the musical performances. Perhaps the best word to describe them ""heavenly"". The combination of location, performance excellence and creative staging make for a very beautiful presentation. Unfortunately this DVD does not appear to be widely available currently in the U.S. How unfortunate!",1234224000,5,775,5.5210084033613445

This one too was a great show.. yes there were some of the productions that didn't appeal to me but overall this was a great dvd and one I am sure that people will play again and again.. Would highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys music and singing.

2827930,4,B000PSP9AI,"The location of this concert is breathtakingly beautiful but until the final stages, Rieu and company seem to lack the ""sparkle and liveliness"" that I've come to expect in his DVDs.  There is one act by a man and his dog--I can't remember the name of the man--that is just plain boring.
