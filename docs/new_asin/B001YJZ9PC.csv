8348084,5,B001YJZ9PC,"Martin Yan takes us on  infectiously enthusiastic journey through some of China's most fascinating regions. Though focusing on the varied cuisine of the regions he visits, he still manages to capture much of the social and cultural atmosphere of each city. He presents as an involved and informed commentator, keen to share his obvious love of food and people. Each episode is full of energy and interest, so much so that I wanted them all to be longer!! Well watching/acquiring for anyone wanting an insight into the significant role of food in China's cultural history.",1395878400,,571,5.010526315789473
8348085,3,B001YJZ9PC,"Part tourist guide, part public relations, part private tour, this DVD can be enjoyable to watch.  2 DVDs with Martin Yan showing us some of the best places to eat, visit, and explore in China.  At least the parts of China that need tourist money.  Its fun to watch but once I finished watching it I couldn't remember half of it.  Martin Yan makes a great host, seems to be friends with half of China, and does truly make things interesting as he seems to know what he is talking about - not just giving us a mindless data dump.  He also seems to ENJOY himself, which really comes out in the DVDs.  Is it a masterpiece?  No.  Is it worth watching?  Yes.  Will it help you plan a visit to China?  Certainly, just make sure to take notes.",1372896000,,736,4.223021582733813
8348086,3,B001YJZ9PC,Good intro to China and the food but not enough detail for me. Doesn't present many recipes or techniques and everything was so positive about China I kept looking to see if I could find the Chinese gov't censors.,1322179200,,213,4.487179487179487
8348087,5,B001YJZ9PC,"My Dad saw this on PBS and had to get it. He loves it a lot! I'm glad, because he's usually very critical about things that he buys. Especially DVDs.",1318291200,,149,4.0
8348088,5,B001YJZ9PC,"When I was little, Chef Martin Yan's YAN CAN COOK was one of my favorite shows. It was mostly his consistently upbeat personality and good humor that kept me watching (along with the interesting dishes he created), but his show also introduced a concept that was, at the time, completely new to me: foreign countries. Again, this is when I was little. Martin Yan introduced me to China, a place that we apparently could not drive to. It was an amazing revelation to me at the time, and I've always held a special place in my heart for Mister Yan's shows. Here, nearly two decades later, my interest in Asia has not waned, and I thought it suiting to take my first steps into learning more about China by starting where it all began. I was not disappointed.

MARTIN YAN'S CHINA TRAVELS acts almost like a scrapbook. There's no narrative or beginning and end. Each disc is broken up into chapters relating to a specific region in China, and each chapter showcases some of Chef Yan's favorite locations. He seems to really go out of his way to show off places in China that few travel shows cover, drawing on his experiences from having been born and raised there. He highlights the important parts of each place, while spending a little time on the places you'd expect to see, like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City. And throughout, he definitely makes sure to show off the local cuisine, be it street food or dishes from five star restaurants.

You'll learn a little about everything: local customs, food preparation, Chinese history and religions, the must-see locations in each region - and there is a lot to see. If I had to guess, I'd say there's about four hours' worth of content across two discs, and all of it is worth seeing to anyone who has an interest in Chinese culture, or even if you're a fan of Martin Yan.

If I had anything negative to say about it, it would be that this set does not include the episodes from MARTIN YAN'S HIDDEN CHINA, a show that is pretty much the companion piece to this set. I would love to see those episodes on DVD, as well, but as it stands, this is a fantastic set. It's a very casual, very upbeat romp through one of the most diverse and beautiful countries in the world. It was a great introduction by one of my most favorite television personalities.",1303776000,10,2301,4.5
8348089,5,B001YJZ9PC,"Excellent travel video. While Yan spends a good deal of time on epicurean delights, there is also plenty of great scenery and interesting people. It is a real pleasure to watch.",1301529600,,177,4.741935483870968
