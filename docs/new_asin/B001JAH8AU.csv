8312536,5,B001JAH8AU,"Having just discovered the great explorer Wade Davis, i went a bit overboard and bought all of his books and DVDs and am happily making my way through them now...But, i have to admit that seeing this DVD ""Wade Davis: Explorer"" set the tone to truly understand and enjoy the adventures and travels of this man.  You must see it if you enjoy his work or if you would like to know more about your world as seen through the eyes of truly amazing teacher and explorer of world cultures.

I have traveled to many of the countries Wade visits in his books and films and i cannot say how much i enjoy his views because they so closely mirror my own...because it would be much too self-centered to do so. :)  This DVD is especially great when Wade takes us with him to Tibet...a country i visited this year for 8 days and can only confirm a bit of what he was able to celebrate on film.  His celebrity enabled him to open gates of wisdom not often opened now to anyone...but he did it with his 'ir-repressible' grin and spirit.  I saw him transformed spiritually during this one episode beyond anything i have ever been able to share with others who love world cultures and want to save them from disappearing entirely now due to political pressures of all kinds.

There are four episodes on this one DVD and any one of them is well worth the time and money involved to see them now!",1293753600,,1374,4.326848249027237

I enjoyed relaxing and watching an entertaining film that was not full of violence to entertain but compassion fueled through curiosity for everything else on the planet ... and everyone else on this wonderful ball of energy hurling through space at an astonishing velocity. What is more authentic then learning about other people's points of views about meaning in life, and what is meaning-full to them - what is at the center of the heart of their culture ... No judgements required, just sit back and witness the marvelous variety we have created together using diversity and unity as tools to craft our uniqueness.",1269820800,4,729,4.84
