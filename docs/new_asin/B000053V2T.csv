7930080,5,B000053V2T,"Tom House was well known in Texas as the pitching coach for the Texas Rangers. He applied some new techniques to pitching and arrived at some different (in some cases radically) ideas. 10 years on, orthodoxy has prevailed over some of the new ideas House espouses in this tape. But this does not mean that the tape has no value. House acknowledges that this tape does not address everything that a pitcher needs to know, but I feel that it does a great job of discussing the mechanics.
There are many drills and concepts in this book that have been very helpful for my son that has begun to show interest in pitching. For example, the towel drill and the step behind and through drill have done much to increase my youngster's strike throwing confidence. The concept of ""tall and fall"" vs. ""drop and drive"" have dramatically improved his balance and consistency.
I chose to hew to orthodoxy by telling my young pitcher to ignore the advice that House gives that younger pitchers can throw breaking pitches without fear if they apply refined mechanics. Basic mechanics are hard enough to master and rather than hope that my son will always have perfect mechanics at age 9, I choose the less mentally demanding route for my son. He has already developed an adequate repertoire of fastballs, which renders special pitches superfluous at his age.

These athletes are at beginning of their pro careers and this statement is about how to get them to this state.
The book dramatically enhances the video because the video hints at and implies many of the things explained in detail in book. The rating is giving exclusive of the breaking pitch advice.",1088726400,3,1816,4.823717948717949
