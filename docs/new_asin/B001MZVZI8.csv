8322676,4,B001MZVZI8,Until I ordered this video I didn't even know there was a short lived series. I enjoyed it very much and the picture quality is very good. I am a fan of Rory Calhoun westerns and plan to get more. Good work. Great Shipping,1316563200,,222,4.068181818181818
8322677,5,B001MZVZI8,"If you like Gunsmoke and Have Gun Will Travel, then you will love The Texan. Our whole family loves this series. I bought this Collector Tin for my son who is in college and he was very happy. I already own the 70 episode DVD set and really wish there were more episodes available of this great television series. The episodes on this set are also found in the 70 episode set. So if you just want to sample the series or want to collect the tin, then buy this set. But, if you are already famililar with The Texan, buy the larger set. I'm happy I bought both.",1311552000,2,559,4.137614678899083

A Rorvic and Desilu Production

I am very pleased to own these 2 DVD containing 10 episodes, I shall now buy the much larger release made in 2009.
One episode called ""The Hemp Tree"" brings together Michael Landon and Rory Calhoun, one episode of Bonanza featured
these actors together as well with a much different outcome.
I am very impressed with the production values, though there does not seem to be a person credited with the simple
but very effective theme music.
Having read that the second season was not as good as the first seems to have been the reason there was not a third
season,I find series such as ""The Texan"" to be far more of interest than a program like Bonanza, though the later
survived for many seasons.",1287360000,,784,4.633093525179856
8322679,4,B001MZVZI8,"I purchased ""The Texan"" tv series dvd set for my brother. We hadn't seen it since we were in our teens in the 60's.
I personally loved ""The Texan"" then and I still do today. Rory Calhoun was a very believable actor and did the series justice.
I believe anyone who is considering buying this dvd set won't be disappointed having in their library.
The sound is excellent as is the picture quality.
There was only one disappointment...it was advertised as being in colour which I was quite excited about, but after watching it in black and white it was just like being kids again.
Sit back and enjoy!!!",1283472000,2,599,4.504587155963303
8322680,5,B001MZVZI8,"In 2008, the Timeless Media Group issued 70 episodes, eight shy of the entire two year series titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texan/dp/B001FRNB62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texan</a>&nbsp;which starred Rory Calhoun as ""Bill Longley,"" another in a series of men who traveled from town-to-town in the Old West trying to right wrongdoings.  The series ran from 1958 to 1960 on CBS and continued in syndication until 1962, supposedly the last time it was broadcast.  Although Longley would shoot when he was forced to do so, his preference was to resolve differences in a peaceful way whenever the opportunity presented itself.

I liked Calhoun's acting in this series . . . . low key and human, yet forceful when he needs to be.  The guest star list is solid with folks like Lon Chaney, Michael Landon, Neville Brand, Cesar Romero, Ralph Meeker and Jack Elam, among others, seen in this collection.  The image quality of the episodes in this collection is excellent.  While not quite the level of CBS Paramount classic TV releases, this release is, perhaps, just a notch below.  The description on the back of the DVD cases indicates that the episodes were pulled from 35 millimeter masters and, judging by the consistently good images on the set, I believe this to be accurate.  Among all of the TV Westerns released to date by the Timeless Media Group, this one's near the top from a visual perspective.

This release contains 10 episodes spread across two discs and packed in an embossed tin.  Those who have already purchased the 70 episode collection of ""The Texan"" can skip this set as none of the eight missing episodes are included here; the episodes in this collection are simply derived from the larger set.  There are no extra features included, not too surprising for a 50 year old television series.  I can't recall ever seeing this series when I was growing up and was a little reluctant to purchase the 70 episode set, not knowing how well I would like it, so this ""sampler"" set was a good choice for me.  Obviously, if you're familiar with this rare-to-see series, the larger set would likely be a better choice.  Suffice to say, ""The Texan"" is a very solid entry among TV Westerns from the classic era (1950s and 1960s) and is a very easy recommendation for fans of TV Westerns and vintage television shows.",1245024000,13,2379,5.00507614213198
