8638368,5,B00I2F9J48,This DVD set is incredibly informative! There's so much information presented on every facet of the hunt that I found myself pausing and taking notes to review. Judging sex all the way to setting up your base camp is covered in the material and it's presented by Joe in a way that even a brand new hunter can understand and learn from it. If you're thinking about a bear hunt or just looking to grow your knowledge in the world of hunting in general this is a great asset to have.  Most hunting books and DVDs are the same run of the mill information but the lecture format this set uses is perfect for someone who wants to learn what to do and look out for at their own pace.  I'm thoroughly impressed with the content.,1393372800,2,720,4.286764705882353
