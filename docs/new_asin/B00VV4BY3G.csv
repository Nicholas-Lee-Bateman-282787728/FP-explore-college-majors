7112897,3,B00VV4BY3G,This movie is just ok.  Storyline is a familiar story.  Troubled teen goes to live with relatives and is exposed to a horse that he bonds with and turns life around. Acting in this movie is just ok.,1483920000,,198,4.184210526315789

7112901,2,B00VV4BY3G,"A slow moving movie, with a boring plot.
The acting is mediocre.  It was hard to sit through the whole film.
I don't recommend this movie.",1464393600,,138,4.3076923076923075

7112904,4,B00VV4BY3G,The movie was good but a very Christian based movie. It really didn't even have much to do about the horse until about half way through the movie.,1441843200,3,146,4.25
7112905,5,B00VV4BY3G,good story line,1440115200,,15,4.333333333333333
7112906,5,B00VV4BY3G,"This is a moving story that will stir your spirit.  It is a straight forward film about loss, despair and ultimate joy.  You will be clapping your hands by the end of the movie.",1501200000,,177,4.176470588235294
7112907,1,B00VV4BY3G,"it must be some kind of christian conspiracy that something this bad gets a 4 star rating!
This is the worst kind of movie... Amazon needs to change their rating system and not allow morons to rate films.",1499558400,,204,4.394736842105263
7112908,5,B00VV4BY3G,Great movie for families to watch.,1498521600,,34,4.833333333333333
7112909,3,B00VV4BY3G,"This movie was clean and wholesome.  NOTHING objectionable.  But the acting was extremely stilted and the whole movie seemed a little less than believable, as a result.  It was a Christian movie but, due to the shallow acting, i almost seemed too forced.  I usually am a sucker for a good horse story, but I won't be watching this one again.",1498262400,,341,4.540983606557377

7112912,5,B00VV4BY3G,"Family friendly film with a nice story. My students (age 10) loved watching it, and said it was a really fun film for them.",1495584000,,123,4.166666666666667
7112913,1,B00VV4BY3G,I started watching this as part of my Prime account. But after maybe 10 minutes I couldn't sit through it anymore. How clear the voices were to me it was clear that none of the voice stuff was done on scene. It was clearly done in a sound booth with little effort to mix it in with the movie properly. Just read lines on the script and the voices were a bit off from the lip movements. I've seen youtube videos better lip synced and modulated for each situation then this.,1495152000,6,472,4.197802197802198
7112914,5,B00VV4BY3G,Great kids movie. :) Definitely would recommend watching it!,1492128000,,60,5.777777777777778

8711368,2,B00VV4BY3G,"I debated between 2 or 3 stars. This movie really isn't about the horse at all. The dialogue is very amateur, and the acting as a whole, especially from the adults, ranges from tolerable to horrendous. The kids, however are extremely cute and likable, and they acted better than the adults did. Luckily, the kids are in most of the scenes. The story concept is fine, but the script takes it no further than a basic outline and does nothing to flesh out the characters. There are also no realistic relationships between anyone; they're all very two-dimensional. All that being said, the moral messages are fine, if too overly simplistic and christian, the kids are adorable, and it's okay family fare. Finally, I have to give credit to Samuel Joshua who did a fine job writing the music for this film. In many ways, the musical score is the most professional part of this film.",1526342400,,876,4.658064516129032
8711369,2,B00VV4BY3G,"Movie is so bad it's unintentionally funny. Has absolutely no relation to real life. Bear (the main horse and only good actor) is supposed to be over 20 years old and looks like a 4 year old. Teddy Bear was NOT the nickname of Theodore Roosevelt. The toy was given the nickname ""Teddy bear"" when Roosevelt refused to shoot a baby bear. There are only two blacks in bit parts. For the most part, it's a bright white world. What library can afford a contest with $300 as the main prize? Who the heck bets on a pole bending contest? What horse show has only ONE class? The winning drawing was obviously someone using tracing paper over a photo. Why does the main character Ethan never comb his hair? Who buys riding lessons for their kid and not kick up a fuss when the kid refuses them? Why is the mother such a saint when she abandoned her horse and her parents upteem years ago? And most importantly, what real bully becomes nice if you treat him or her nice? This movie is proof there is no God -- if there was, He'd be sure to make a better picture.",1521590400,,1051,4.26
8711370,1,B00VV4BY3G,"Like most Christian movies, unfortunately, the acting was terrible and the story was boring and predictable.",1519171200,,108,5.8125
8711371,5,B00VV4BY3G,Wonderful movie! It touches your soul and inspires you to have faith!,1513123200,,69,4.833333333333333
8711372,5,B00VV4BY3G,Good family movie,1508803200,,17,5.0
8711373,2,B00VV4BY3G,"About 40 minutes of this movie was about all I could handle. The acting was horrendous. I kept wanting to throw Otto a bottle of Seroquel or Abilify or something. His cameos and talks with Bear were good and I enjoyed those, but the minute he turned into ""raging Otto"" he was beyond disbelief; his acting was deplorable.
The only decent actors in the entire movie were the three kids from next door.

As a Christian movie -- I don't care one way or another. I wasn't watching it for that aspect, I was in it for the horses. I do like the messages they tend to try to get across, though, and with better actors this one might have worked.",1508025600,,637,4.264462809917355
8711374,2,B00VV4BY3G,"Sadly, this low level of production is par for the course for Christian films.  Really bad acting, really dumb screenplay and just a silly story.  Boy's mom dies, he goes to grandparent's house (who are expecting him) and when he shows up at the door grandma says ""What are you doing here?""  Huh?  The production also included aerial shots of various locations which they insisted on using as goofy transitions between scenes; two people are talking and then there's a hard cut to an aerial view of a farm and then another hardcut to barn interior, and they do this over and over again.  Seems to me that this was done by some large church and they just pulled people out of the pews to take on various roles.  All in all it felt like a high school play.",1506297600,2,754,4.388489208633094
8711375,5,B00VV4BY3G,Excellent story and very touching. My six year old and three year old girls loved it and it stirred their spirit very much. I feel blessed to have watched it with them.,1504224000,,168,4.28125
