8355163,3,B0027UY8C2,"This DVD is labeled ""all-region,"" but is in PAL format rather than the US standard NTSC.  It works on my computer, but not on my DVD player or my Blu-ray player.

It contains about 60 minutes of short Rolie Polie Olie cartoons, and they're all cute and fun to watch.  I just wish there had been more information on the Amazon description page about the format.",1376006400,,360,4.424242424242424
