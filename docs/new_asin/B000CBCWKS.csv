2455017,5,B000CBCWKS,"If you love crime dramas,especially the one's based on true stories,then ""The FBI Murders"" is the film for you. Despite it's low-budget ""Made-for-TV"" trappings...I consider this to be just as powerful as the Al Pacino/Robert DeNiro thriller ""Heat"".

  For those of you who don't remember, ""In the line of duty"" was a series of TV movies profiling the couragous and sometimes harrowing true tales of law enforcement officers and their bravery under fire. Over the years,the quality of these hard-hitting dramas have lost their luster...But the ""FBI Murders"" stands out as one of the best in the crime genre.

  This particular movie centers on two Vietnam vets (David Soul and Michael Gross) who use their military training to pull off a string of violent,commando-style,bank and armored car robberies from the Fall of 1985 to the Spring of 1986 in Florida to support their families,mistresses,and lavish lifestyle after their series of hair-brained ""get rich quick"" schemes fall through. Their lightning-quick strikes and disappearances has left the police,and even the FBI's elite robbery task force,one fatal step behind.

  Like the film ""Heat"",which I referenced earlier,the film focuses on the personal lives of the robbers and the agents. Michael Gross turns in a chilling character that is a far cry from his ""sensitive dad"" persona of ""Family Ties"".Gross's character is a scary psychopath who may or may not have been behind the brutal murder of his first wife and who is certainly abusive to his current wife and children despite his aura of Christian respectability. David Soul on the other hand is the opitamy of the ""slow burning fuse"".He's cold,calculating,and throughly dangerous.

  On the FBI side,the focus is on the lead investigator in the robberies played by Ronny Cox. He's a straight arrow veteran who has no wife and kids...he's married to the FBI.What's worse is he's having to break in a hot-shot kid (Bruce Greenwood in an early role) as his new partner. The rest of the FBI unit is the picture of the ""brotherhood of lawmen"" cliche. They kid around with one another,they even have affectionate names and a few of them have interesting personal stories. For instance,when the head of the department (the actor's name escapes me, unfortunately) learns that a civilian who followed the bandits after one of their heists,traces the killers into the agent's neighborhood,the agent grow afraid that his family could end up victims and begins prowling the area for their getaway car. Another agent grapples with trying to make his young son understand that he doesn't go around getting into gunfights like the TV Cop Shows portray.

  As the tension builds around these personal stories....the robbers are getting more and more desperate. And the agents are getting more and more determaned. And that climaxes into what has now been called one of the FBI's bloodiest shoot-outs. For high tension and high drama...this movie delivers.",1142208000,9,2953,5.148535564853557
2455018,4,B000CBCWKS,"I've been waiting for this to come out on dvd - sadly no major studio would release this tv-movie so we have no extras or remastered video quality, but what we do get isn't bad at all. Better that I could have from burning my original vhs tape that I recorded off tv when it originally aired, plus the commercials are gone and they didn't edit ANY of the gunfire/play out of it. For, make no mistake, this is one harrowing experience for a tv-movie. The final confrontation between these 2 sociopathic bankrobbers and the FBI agents is one of those ""time stands still"" moments that really stays with you once you've seen it. Highly recommended - grab this while it's still around - dvd's like this seem to dissappear quickly.

You'll never see Michael Gross and David Soul the same way again - they are THAT GOOD in this film as two criminals that have absolutely no remorse for their actions. All that play the FBI agents are excellent as well, plus Bruce Greenwood in a very early role. A classic crime film - that it was a tv-movie makes it even more of an oddity and statement of past American tv culture. Those times are long gone, folks.",1135814400,6,1143,4.442857142857143

2455026,5,B000CBCWKS,"Saw this movie years ago. Decided to buy it. Very good decision. Very good movie on what should have been a felony arrest that went south very quickly. FBI was out gunned that day. You must use the proper tools for the situation at hand. They just did not know at the time how ruthless these two guys were. Im a firm believer that you should use the heaviest grain round your defensive weapon will shoot reliably, and accurately. Im still thinking about getting a .45 APC with 230 grain round for my self defense weapon to replace my 9mm. until then, I have 135 gr and 147 gr rounds. Im Federal L.E.

2455027,5,B000CBCWKS,"This TV movie is one of the best and most memorable TV movies from the 80s. The movie was broadcast in 1988 based on a real event from 1986. The movie concerns bank robberies perpetrated by two former Army buddies in Miami and the FBI agents who tail them. The movie does a great job of establishing its two sides the good versus the bad. As to be expected, the bad guys are undoubtedly the stars as you can plainly see by the DVD cover. The two baddies are played by TV icons of the 70s and 80s. Bill Matix is played by Michael Gross who at the time was riding high as Steven Keaton the patriarch of the sitcom Family Ties. His partner in TV crime is Mike Platt played by David Soul, who in the 70s played Detective Hutch in the cop series Starsky & Hutch. Mike and Bill are old friends from the Army who remain close in civilian life. They seem to be in the landscape business but they have a series of other ventures, chief among them is armed robbery. They shake down a  man who has sold them broken pinball machines and on the spur of the moment become bank robbers by jacking an armored car. They get little money but their appetite for bank robbing is whetted so they set forth on a crime spree that shocks all of Miami. On their heels quickly is the FBI, more specifically a special team force dubbed ""The Funsters"". We first meet their rookie member Agent Dove played by Bruce Greenwood who has just started his FBI career. He's introduced to his commander Agent Grogan played by veteran actor Ronny Cox. The movie does a good job of establishing rapport and chemistry between the FBI agents. Although they are the drab good guys, the viewer gets a sense that these men genuinely like each other and like working together. They are all decent dedicated lawmen who play by the rules and then go home to their families. The antagonists on the other hand are sneaky and sly. In particular Gross' character Matix is seen in church preaching about how ""the good Lord"" has blessed him and his new family. Matix's last wife was murdered and the investigation is still trailing him. The viewer gets enough clues to figure out that Matix may have had something to do with her murder. His new wife or girlfriend is now pregnant which infuriates Matix to the point of telling the woman to leave for good. She does and by the middle of the movie Matix has a new gf named Vicky played by 80s starlet Teri Copley. Soul's character Platt has a more stable environment at home but Platt is literally a ticking time bomb who loves automatic weapons and their potential violence. He brags to his stepson that he was trained for Vietnam until ""some wimp in Washington pulled the plug"". He encourages the boy to join the Army and ""kick butt"". Platt is the undeniable leader of the bank robbing pair. The duo talk about their earlier robberies of drug dealers but Platt claims that drug dealers are too well-armed now and that they would be safer shooting it out with the police. It's a harbinger of things to come! The bank robberies continue and even increase in frequency. Platt even decides that the duo should rob the same bank twice in just a few days! The robbers use Army techniques like smoke screens and camofluage outfits complete with black ski masks. They are vicious in their misdeeds as they shoot and kill an armored car guard in the back just to rob him. They also steal cars for their robberies by ambushing target shooters in the Everglades. One of these robberies proves to be their undoing as their victim actually survives being shot several times and identifies the duo. This sets up the closing act which is simply unforgettable! The shootout between Platt/Matix and the FBI Funsters is something you won't soon forget. IMO it's much more memorable than the movie ""Heat"". In fact I would rate this humble little TV movie as being much more satisfying and entertaining a movie than the big screen ""Heat"" with Deniro and Pacino. Just my opinion but I recommend this DVD if you can get it and like my title says it's fun to watch this movie repeatedly!",1402444800,,4061,4.495263870094723

I noticed that this DVD is now out of print in 2014, and is selling for quite a bit more than the $6.99 I paid for it new in 2007. Just a warning to those thinking of spending the big bucks for this now OOP DVD: the DVD version was edited and is not the complete original TV movie. Go to the IMDB forum for this movie and it's discussed on at least one thread. For those who saw the original TV broadcast in 1988, you will notice many scenes that were deleted in the DVD release, which is frustrating. However, the story line remains intact, and I just couldn't bring myself to give this classic anything less than five stars. The entire cast was superb, especially Michael Gross.

I purchased this DVD because it's based on actual events taken from the FBI files which now serves as a training model for the FBI dealing with violent street criminals.  Paticularly sickening to the authorities is the gratuitous use of violence by two rambo like killers who dress themselves up in military garb to rob banks in a small Florida town. The story culminates when the FBI lays a stakeout, the suspects smell a rat, leading to a terrifying chase and bloody shootout, dubbed the bloodiest in FBI history.

This movie details precisely (enough so anyway)the string of incidents that lead up to that terrible tragedy. The characters portrayed in the movie were seasoned actors who put their heart and soul in to making this almost documentary. Yes, I said Soul with the pun intended because, one of the killers' character was played by David Soul and he played the part expertly. The film was so well done back in the early-mid 80s that the FBI incorporated it in their basic training block at the FBI Academy at Quantico VA.

For anyone looking for a heart pumping real life made for TV movie that actually tells it like it was, this is a keeper. I used this same film in my firearms programs that I ran when I became an Academy Instructor myself and I always had officers, both veteran and rookie who would shed tears over the senseless killing of the youngest FBI agent and the Veteran FBI Agent.

Great movie and I would recommend this to anyone interested in true life stories of the battle between good and pure evil.

2455044,3,B000CBCWKS,"Mostly I bought this because of the notoriety of this incident in firearms training lectures.
The chaos and protracted nature of the final shootout is well-portrayed. Those FBI agents were really out on a limb with only enough firepower for one quick exchange of gunfire, while the robbers were well-trained ex soldiers with military-style weapons, mags taped together for a fast reload.
The film was weakened by slow pacing and weak characterizations.  However the dominant bad guy was nuanced, gently teaching his stepson basketball, when not busy sadistically pumping bullets into helpless wounded victims on the ground.
No situational awareness was displayed by the law abiding solitary shooters, intent on target practice in remote swamps, assuming they were alone, wearing ear muffs, totally focused on their targets. Sneaking up on them and murdering them was how the bank robbers acquired getaway cars that couldn't be traced to them, without leaving any witnesses who could describe the robbers' faces or car.",1318118400,,1018,5.3625

I was recently reading a critique on our societies treatment of death that decried, ""Shows showing legions of bad guys falling with no regard to what makes death death..""  No such lie is found at the end of this film. The gun battle at the end of the movie seems to aim for nothing less than portrayal of the horrifying reality of the shootout.

David Soul and Michael Gross' portrayal of sociopathic criminals is uncompromising and realistic, and yet, at the agonizing end, you not only feel sorry for the FBI agents that tracked them down, but for them as well, such is the pain and agony portrayed in those last, few, bloody minutes of this film.

All of the actors do a competent job in the rolls. The standout is Michael Gross, coming of his roll in Family Ties, does an outstanding job as William Mattox. This is one of Bruce Greenwoods early rolls and he does an ok job.

The movie glosses over the fact the most of the Agents were SWAT Team members and had better weapons than the armed robbers. But the weapons along with their heavy body armor was in their trunks. The final shootout is extremely accurate from the accounts I have read.

Truth be known, it was very poor tactics that caused the single most deadly day in FBI history. It began with the agents failing to use good vehicle position when making a felony stop, and progressed to learning never just bring a handgun, when the bad guys have a military caliber rifle, with high-capacity magazines. David Soul plays the Ruger Mini-14 armed bank robber, and his acting is excellent. He truly is creepy, and lends a lot to the character.

In the end, the bravery of one badly wounded agent, saved the day. However, not before several were agents were killed, and the rest gravely injured.

This movie is a good police training tool, concerning an incident that every law enforcement officer has heard about. Unfortunately, it is one that shows what NOT to do, rather graphically.",1179100800,16,1014,4.782857142857143
2455054,5,B000CBCWKS,"Finally out on DVD, fans of true crime dramas and action films will really enjoy this 1988 made-for-television production. Based on actual events in Miami, Florida (I'm not sure how embellished), ""In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders concerns a pair of military trained bank- robbers and the FBI task force who attempted to identify and apprehend them. This is a far cry from the fictional movies that attempt to glorify G-Men or violent criminals.

Both sides are portrayed in their real life bumbling glory as the robbers act stupidly and recklessly and the task force basically stumbles into them and is ill prepared for the confrontation. But this makes the story quite fascinating and if you connect with it you will probably want to watch it several times.

The film is structured as two parallel stories and what suspense there is stems from the viewers knowledge that the two stories will eventually intersect with each other, you just don't know how or when it will occur.

The strength of the film (besides its real life feel) is the characterization of the two robbers, played by David Soul and Michael Gross. Although their backgrounds are fragmentary, it appears that they bring out the worst in each other and their crime spree continues more for the adrenaline rush it provides. They begin to really get off on the violence and power, their crimes are almost random which tends to work in their favor as the investigation can find little logic or pattern behind their activities.

The film's weakness is the parallel story of the task force. This was a far cry from a cerebral Sherlock Holmes type investigation so you eagerly wait for them to cut back to Soul and Grace. The characterizations are generally shallow and weak so almost all viewers will end up identifying with the two criminals; even though they have a lot of mad dog qualities. Doug Sheehan is quite effective as the task force commander, but the Bruce Greenwood - Ronny Cox pairing (rookie and veteran) never really connects.  Greenwood has gone on to do some amazing stuff under Atom Egoyan's direction, he obviously has far more talent than he shows in this role.

 The violent climax is worth waiting for, although the violence is in real time, the confrontation has the slow-mo feel of a Sam Peckinpah production.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1169942400,25,2347,4.792079207920792

2455056,4,B000CBCWKS,"Based on the actual events that took place in 1985, The FBI Murders chronicles the events leading up to the largest FBI casualties ever suffered at one time in the history of the agency. Two well trained ex Green Beret buddies (played by David Soul & Michael Gross) team up and start robbing armored cars in Florida. Eventually they raise the stakes and start killing people during these robberies. The FBI tails these two and while attempting to arrest both men, one of the worst shoot-outs in law enforcement history ensues. When it's all over, several FBI agents are dead, there are several agents wounded and both suspects are shot and killed. This movie is made-for-tv, but it is still one of the hardest, most intense I've seen on network television. The ruthlesness and violence of these men is not toned down at all as in one scene, David Soul literally walks around looking for the surviving/wounded FBI agents and begins executing them on the ground. Highly recommended for fans of true stories or crime.",1148774400,30,1014,4.8

8096573,5,B000CBCWKS,"Great movie! Few know that this shootout is what spawned the birth of the .40S&W cal. round. They claim that Michael Platt (one of the bank robbers) should have been fatally wounded with the first round from agent Ben Grogan's 459 Smith 9mm. As Platt crawled from the passenger side of the car, Grogan's Winchester silver tip entered Platt's right bicep exiting his inner arm, and entering his right lateral ribs. The hollow point then deflated Platt's right lung, and stopped an inch from his heart. This allowed Platt to continue fighting, enabling  him to kill two FBI agents including Grogan, and critically wounding several others. This shootout left the FBI looking for a sidearm  which had capacity comparable to a 9mm, yet ballistics closer to a .357 magnum. One of the agents involved in the actual shootout used his personal 10mm Delta Elite as a test weapon. They decided that the 10mm had too much recoil, and ultimately used a cut down version of the cartridge. So at the end of the day, a .40S&W is a 10mm short. William Matix died after 6 gunshot wounds, and Michael Platt died after being shot 12 times. Toxicology reports from the autopsy on both suspects came back %100 clean.",1495497600,,1194,4.735576923076923

8096575,5,B000CBCWKS,"This is one of the best not only TV movie but better than any of the garbage they make for TV and theaters by Hollyweird today! From the acting
to the writing to directing there isn't anything that isn't perfect. Of course David Soul ""Hutch"" is one of the best movie and TV actors of all time
and best known for Starsky and Hutch but I think this may well be his best movie besides Salem's Lot. Michael Gross from Family Ties? I think
does an excellent job like you would never think he could do in this role. Ronny Cox and rest of cast as FBI agents are also great and the gun
battle at the end is done extremely well without being too violent even though it is and was in real life since this is a true story. What's striking
is with all the anti cop garbage going on now that this movie really hits a home run. I may have seen this when first aired as a fan of Soul but
I didn't remember anything about it and I'm sorry took me so long to find this classic TV movie again! A must have for real movie fans.",1470873600,,1008,3.995049504950495
