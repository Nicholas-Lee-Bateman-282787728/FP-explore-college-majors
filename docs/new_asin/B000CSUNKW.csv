2473473,5,B000CSUNKW,"I saw this on the telvision specials and it is hilarious. Dave Attell is very good and Sean Rouse and Greg Giraldo are descent good, but Dane Cook (which why I'm sure people view this at first) is great. New material from Cook makes this awesome, as he goes on about the Price is Right and Parties, etc.) As long as they don't screw up the format or content of the DVD, this is awesome.",1138665600,5,386,4.16
2473474,5,B000CSUNKW,"This comedy special is ha- ha- ha-larious. Dane Cook has never been more funny. It is the best cure if you're in a bad mood.

Just pop it on anytime even as background noise, you won't be let down.",1135468800,6,197,4.051282051282051

2473481,5,B000CSUNKW,My mother and I first saw this in 2005. It remained on her DVR for years. She switched companies and thought it was lost forever. Epic Mother's Day present. :),1370563200,,159,4.333333333333333
2473482,5,B000CSUNKW,"Except for one of the comics' acts, this was all hilarious (albeit Attell's nauseating vulgarity at times.) The cherry on top is Dane Cook of course, and Greg Giraldo was equally as fun.",1369785600,,186,4.666666666666667
2473483,5,B000CSUNKW,Very funny stuff. Too bad Greg Giraldo died so soon. Very funny. would definitely recommend to people. Have a good one.,1355875200,,119,4.714285714285714
2473484,5,B000CSUNKW,"This is by far one of the best comedy shows of pure talent I've seen and bought to savor the show over and over again.  Each comedian brought something to the stage and I couldn't help but laugh.  Dave Attell talking about women very funny, Sean Rouse using everyday humor, Greg Giraldo(RIP) one of best material on the show. I only found some of Dane cook's material over the egde, but still give it five stars rating.  I will forever miss Giraldo on the roasts and his comedy cd's.  Plus midlife vices great comedy show pick that one up if you enjoy Greg Giraldo on here and the comedy central roasts.",1338768000,,603,4.405405405405405
2473486,5,B000CSUNKW,A really good line-up on this comendy special. Attell and Giraldo are ATF's and also enjoy some of Cook's work and Rouse was really funny as well.,1320537600,,146,4.444444444444445
2473487,4,B000CSUNKW,This is worth owning for Greg Giraldo's and Dave Attell's bits. Both are in top form here. I found Sean Rouse mildly amusing and Dane Cook pretty unfunny.,1307232000,3,154,4.535714285714286
2473488,5,B000CSUNKW,"One of my favorite stand up shows.  I watched it every time when it  aired on Comedy Central and decided, why not, I might as well buy it!!",1270684800,,139,3.9285714285714284
2473489,4,B000CSUNKW,I purchased this cd mainly for Dane Cook.  I think he's hysterical and can't seem to find too many dvd's of his.  The whole dvd turned out to be pretty funny. Not everybodys best but certainly good enough to pop in and get a few laughs.,1168300800,,236,4.108695652173913
2473490,5,B000CSUNKW,these comedians are HILARIOUS.  what a collection of talented men.  BUY THIS!,1154908800,4,77,5.333333333333333
2473491,2,B000CSUNKW,My wife and I ejected this DVD after half way through and planned to throw it out.  I later figured I'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it.  The last guy is good and I won't throw this away now; he does a bit on throwing up that is good.  Most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny.,1152230400,2,313,3.6417910447761193
2473492,5,B000CSUNKW,"I saw this uncensored on Comedy Central over the weekend and it is the funniest stand up I have seen in a very long time.  Sean Rouse and Greg Giraldo were funny.  I'd never seen Dane Cook before but he was pretty funny too.  The highlight was definitely Dave Attell--I, very literally, laughed so hard I almost threw up.  I love Dave Attell in his other Comedy Central shows--but here he is no holds barred and it is AWESOME!!!  I am so thrilled to find this on DVD so that I can watch it again...I hope I don't yack!",1150675200,5,518,4.191919191919192
2473493,5,B000CSUNKW,"Saw the live show at House of Blues and have been waiting anxiously for the DVD to be available. Finally watched it last night and it was terrific.  Dane Cook was super (as usual), Dave Attell was good, and Sean Rouse and Greg Giraldo were surprisingly funny!  If you're a Cook or Attell fan, I'd give it 2 thumbs up!!!",1145232000,3,319,4.3
2473494,5,B000CSUNKW,"I tell you right now This was one of the funniest DVD's I have seen in a long time, but This was actually a 3 star review in reality, the only reason I give it a 5 is 1) Dave Attell's stand up is phenomenal in this Vegas Show, I liked INsomniac but he wasn't at his best...in this show, this DVD Dave is on his game, My sides hurt, and since he's host he splits his stand up between all 3 comics Greg, Sean And Dane, you get to see Dave at all parts of the show. 2.) THe cutscenes in Vegas were pretty funny from their gambling spending to their idea on a title for the Dvd was pretty hillarious. and 3.) Finally, the saving grace and the best part of this DVD was Dane Cook. You can tell the difference when everyone else comes out and when Dane comes out, he was obviously the headliner and they saved im for last. Dane presents some brand new material not even heard on Retalliation to this Show, I watched it 7 times and its still funny everytime I hear it. Dane talks about his Gay Roomate S's, to having fun throwing up. Getting blown for the first time. Dane presents some great new material here and mixed with Dave Attells kick a** standup presents a great DVD Vegas show. Greg Giraldo was funny at times but not funny enough to watch twice and Sean Rouse really plain sucked, he might be a funny guy, but on this DVD he just plain sucked. So if your looking for something funny and your a Dane Cook fanatic, this is the DVD Dane has over 30 minutes of personnal standup time and Dave Attell is on the DVD throughout the show. Go Get this DVD you won't regret it.",1144540800,13,1572,4.1237785016286646
2473495,5,B000CSUNKW,"I sat front row for this show in Vegas, you even see me about 5 times during the comedy central version of the show. Dane even gave me a high 5 (that missed barely) and was thankfully cut...lol.

I can tell you the CC version had ALOT cut out, and was still VERY funny. I am really looking forward to seeing if the added material is the really rauchy HILARIOUS stuff. Sean Rouse was just as funny if not better than Dane... but it was VERY racy... I'd definitely buy if that stuff was back in... probably will anyways to remember my first appearance on Comedy Central too!

You'll love it either way, but man I hope they decided to show the whole sets of each guy.",1144022400,4,664,4.2204724409448815

8101975,5,B000CSUNKW,"This may be an oldie, but this group of comedians together at that time of their careers, is hilarious. Sean Rouse is very underrated. If you have not heard or seen Rouse do a web search for him and check some of his material out. Rouse is also on the 'The Unbookable's' a movie/documentary about some oddball comedians, its on Amazon Prime.",1485475200,,341,4.516129032258065
8101976,5,B000CSUNKW,"Greg Giraldo was the bestand his riffing during the fire alarm was alone worth the price of the DVD. Greg, roast in peaceas opposed to roasting in a theater in Las Vegas.",1485129600,,170,4.34375

8101979,3,B000CSUNKW,"I bought this just for Giraldo. If you're a fan of his and a collector, go ahead and snatch this up. Giraldo shines, Dave is funny, I can't recall Sean's performance, but Dane Cook wasn't funny.",1454198400,,194,4.416666666666667

8101981,4,B000CSUNKW,"Classic stand up. The only downside is Dave uses his ""Your mouths not pregnant"" stsnd up in this one, which was good but could have used some  original material.",1444608000,,161,4.551724137931035
8101982,5,B000CSUNKW,"ANYTHING with Dave Attell is worth buying. And GREG GIRALDO!!! Their extremely sick view on life (extremely raunchy material) is the humor I love. Also you see a few moments where the 4 of them enjoy Vegas, and a few things I didn't know. 4 White Guy's that are funny 1 DVD, who would have thought?",1443744000,,298,4.339285714285714
