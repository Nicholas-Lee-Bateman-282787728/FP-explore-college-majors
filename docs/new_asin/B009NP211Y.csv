5356715,5,B009NP211Y,"This Dvd of Charles Jenkins is TRULY AMAZING!!!  Glad I decided to purchase to have the true experience of worshipping God freely in the sanctuary!!!  You can tell that it was NOT staged or just some performance.  EXCELLENCE through and through!!!  The explanations that Pastor Jenkins gives of why this project deserves this tiitle is phenomenal.  Ever wonder why there's a difference in various churches in gospel music, praise & worship, hymn music, traditional, etc.?  It will be broken down to you for all to understand.  I do miss the fact that the song Grace & Mercy and Karen Clark Sheard is NOT shown in singing Releasing My Faith.  It does make up for it by letting us see the congregation go into high praise with waving of hands, dancing & shouting!!!  No matter who you are & you TRULY LOVE THE LORD, invest in this DVD of Pastor Charles Jenkins.",1357776000,,859,4.635761589403973
