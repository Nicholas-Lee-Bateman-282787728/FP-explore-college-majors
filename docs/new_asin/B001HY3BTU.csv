The emotions portrayed in all of the photos are so real.  I have never seen a picture of Mary at the crucifiction which shows a mother's anguish the way this one does.  All of the pictures draw you closer to Christ.  I'm sure it will help our entire family get closer to Him and His presence.",1237939200,4,417,4.227848101265823

8309987,5,B001HY3BTU,Love the photography and the music out to the photos is perfect to set a reverent tone.,1482364800,,87,4.176470588235294
8309988,5,B001HY3BTU,"This video was everything I had hoped it would be. It was beautifully produced and spiritual and left me feeling uplifted. It strengthened my testimony that Jesus is the Saviour and that he did indeed come to earth to redeem mankind. He was crucified and rose again on the third day. The video takes you through the bible stories so personally, you almost feel like you are there with Him.
The best part is the end when you know that He  rose from the dead.. The video films like a documentary with the end leaving you feeling happy! He LIVES :)
Thank you Mark Mabry and crew! Well done!",1419552000,,587,4.385321100917431
8309989,5,B001HY3BTU,It was on time and I loved it so touching. I would reccomend it to anyone. Great DVD and great sender.,1364860800,,102,3.9047619047619047
8309990,3,B001HY3BTU,"I expected a music DVD. Instead it was about producing one. It just didn't do what I expected. Interesting commentary, however.",1363478400,,127,5.095238095238095
8309991,5,B001HY3BTU,"Such a touching DVD. I already had the book, and saw the slide show on Youtube. The musical arrangement is beautiful, and I love knowing the story behind it all. I would highly recommend!",1361577600,,187,4.529411764705882
8309992,5,B001HY3BTU,"This video is great for a fireside.  It is also a good way to share your testimony of Christ with a friend with a short attention span.  A fellow Christian watching it would realize that yes, Mormons are Christians.  I enjoy watching it every once in a while on a Sunday.",1352505600,,271,4.2745098039215685
8309993,5,B001HY3BTU,"I had seen this video before.  The images and music are inspiring.  I had to get one for myself and some for others.

The images from the life of Christ are beautiful.  My favorites are the ones of Christ being baptized.  The joy on His and John's faces are wonderful.

You will watch this over and over again and never get tired of it.  Get several copies and share with your family and friends.",1311638400,,396,4.27027027027027
8309994,5,B001HY3BTU,"I love what Mark has done with photography in this DVD and book.  It is amazing!  I can watch the slide show over and over again.  It really helps bring the life of Christ alive and tangible... you almost feel like you are right there.  It's a beautiful, amazing art form he has created.",1285372800,,287,4.2592592592592595
8309995,4,B001HY3BTU,I saw this played in a very small segment on TV - during a LDS conference. I purchased it and was amazed at the making of this DVD. To see the process that they went through - the actors - the equipment and photography setup - was just plain great. Then to see the finished product - and the beautiful scenes that were produced - was well worth the price paid. Reflections of Christ - has no background to tie you into any religion - but if you believe in GOD - you will find this DVD well worth your spending a few minutes - watching - to reflect on the Glory of a truly great personage.,1261872000,,588,4.034188034188034
8309996,2,B001HY3BTU,"I'm sure that the photographs are excellent.  However, in this DVD, the slide show of the photographs is given secondary priority, very little time is allowed for viewing each photo, and it's impossible to discern the detail in most of them.  The main feature of the DVD isn't the pictures themselves -- it's all about the production of the pictures -- very interesting in itself, but hardly what I expected, and certainly not the kind of material I would send as a Christmas gift.  I had hoped I might be able to send this DVD to a lot of friends and family, but instead I'm returning it to Amazon.",1259798400,,599,4.477064220183486
