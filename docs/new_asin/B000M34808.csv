These images and definitions of experience, take you far beyond any I have seen, they are pure in nature and the filming was done with such patience and insight that it deserves accolades galore.

This should be appreciated for what it's content is, a look at places on the earth that are brought to the point of their absolute beauty and creative form and should be appreciated for just that alone.

The intent of being calmed and relaxed is real, especially with sights and sounds like the music for meditation, but for me, I loved every incredible visual affect it brought to the forefront.

One of the best I have ever seen!

8166095,5,B000M34808,"This is a top quality dvd to relax to, I used it to fall asleep while I was in my college dorm which requires some extra nature sounds for me to fall asleep in considering I'm from the country and the sounds of a hundred horny teenagers mostly guys and their unorderly lifestyle leaves you unrested and this will help you get some of it back.",1361059200,,342,4.196969696969697
8166096,5,B000M34808,I have bipolar disorder and recently had to stop a major anti-anxiety medication due to side effects. Now I just put this on and I feel calm and relaxed. The photography is absolutely beautiful and the music is well-done. Outstanding product.,1315180800,,242,4.926829268292683
8166097,1,B000M34808,"I bought this dvd on the recommendation of the reviews and was extremely disappointed.  I thought it would be beautiful scenery--it was alot of close ups of green leaves, sticks, flowers.  I am sick of looking at green leaves.  I didn't find it at all relaxing.  Some of the scenes actually repeated.  The music was something out of the 60's--reminded me of the sitar music and it had some annoying metalic tinkling going on.  I turned the sound off and tried to get into the pictures, but green leaves didn't make it for me.  Plus I am having trouble with the dvd sticking and I actually don't care if I see the whole thing or not--you can only take so much of green leaves and sticks.  Don't waste your money.",1279152000,,711,4.415384615384616
8166098,5,B000M34808,I work in a hospital and we have added a new TV station just to air these videos. The maker of these videos was very coopertive during this process we did not want to break any copy right laws so we contacted him and he had no problem letting us air all three of the mindflo videos. I knew from the first time i veiwed them that our patients would find them as enjoyable as i did. Just wanted to tell you how much we appreciated your cooperation during this process.,1214352000,4,466,4.131868131868132
8166099,5,B000M34808,"I'm going to give this video 5 stars because it is just stunning photography. Many gorgeous close up's of our natural environment and the music is perfect. BCI Video which produces it uses HD camera's to capture every detail. They would like to put the Mindflo series out in true HD format, but due to the format wars and the high cost to produce HD-DVD, they are waiting for a resolution.

I often play this DVD on my Toshiba HD-DVD player that up converts and passes the signal to a 60"" Sony 1080p display with superb results for a standard DVD format. Everyone that sees it is astonished by the beauty and relaxing music. The sounds of streams, the wind and birds is beautifully captured and presented.",1196467200,4,705,4.551181102362205
8166100,2,B000M34808,"I bought this product because it was described as a nature meditation. when I played it was a compilation of different natural sites with music in the background, but nothing out of the extraordinary. I was expecting something more spectacular for the price I payed. So, I guess that is how we find out if something is worth the price and this one comes short of it's description.",1195862400,7,380,4.602941176470588
8166101,5,B000M34808,"I am a long time fan of all the Mindflo DVD's.  Mindflo 3 is different from 1 & 2 because there are no chapters or breaks in the flow of the visuals and music.  Once I began watching my mind relaxed more deeply and I found myself going deeper and deeper into relaxation.  Once or twice I found myself so relaxed that I nodded off for a moment.  The DVD is the most relaxing of the three.  Each Mindflo seems to offer the viewer a different prospective and seems to have a different purpose.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone having a problem relaxing.  The visuals are beautiful and the music intertwines seamlessly.  I can not decide on a favorite Mindflo, but when I want deep relaxation I watch Mindflo 3.
