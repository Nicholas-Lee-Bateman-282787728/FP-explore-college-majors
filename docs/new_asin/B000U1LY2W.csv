8211724,5,B000U1LY2W,I purchased this for my classroom along with an original library copy of the book. My kids (ages 3-5) love this story. Great quality and timeless classic.,1402876800,,154,4.7407407407407405
8211725,5,B000U1LY2W,"This is one of my favorite books and movies. I use to show this to preshcoolers when I went to perform storytimes at libraries and daycare centers in the 1980's. I probably saw it 350 times over two years. However, I never got tired of it. Later when I worked as the Youth coordinator at the Hoover Public Library in Birmingham, Alabama I invited Bruce McMillan to visit to share his books and this wonderful story and movie with our community. He came and we had a great time. I love his other books also.

Now, decades later I wanted to share this treasure with my favorite little boy and went to find it on nexflix or anywhere, but can only find it in VHS! I don't even have a VHS player anymore. Unbelievable! I will check our local library system catalog and it may still be available at one of our libraries. But I liked it so much I wanted my own copy. I cannot believe this treasure is not in DVD or on Netflix. I hope someday Bruce will allow it to be available in download, DVD or the next big format so the world will not miss this great story and movie.

Please, please make it available for the world.",1373068800,2,1114,4.225352112676056
