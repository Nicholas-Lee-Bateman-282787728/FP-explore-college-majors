8407034,4,B003VQZ4SS,"Once extremely popular, and produced internationally, this 1881 ballet, with its choreography by Luigi Manzotti and music by Romualdo Marenco, is full of delights. While the ""plot"" is hardly gripping, there is enough in the way of great dancing to keep you entertained. Who can resist a a ballet story that promotes The Brooklyn Bridge, The Suez Canal and Volta's experiments with batteries ?
If there is a fault here, it is that there is too much miming. However, the big dance moments will not disappoint.
Filmed in 1978 during La Scala's bicentenary season, the performance is great fun, although the images are sometimes a bit grainy, and the mono sound recording is not ideal.",1452470400,,681,4.930434782608696
