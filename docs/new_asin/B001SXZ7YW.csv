Product: This is a detailed history of the road system that circled the National Parks of our west.  Said to be the longest road at the time in the United States, it was designed to allow travel to the parks via personal autos, something that was new at a time when railroads provided most of the transport in the Western States.
It takes place in the mid 1920's and if you are an antique car lover, a national park lover and/or a history lover this is a DVD you will want.
Very well done using film made on the original trip in the 1920's, this PBS DVD is a keeper.",1246147200,9,625,4.243697478991597
