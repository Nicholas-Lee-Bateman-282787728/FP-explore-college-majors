2797901,5,B000OONRSY,"As inflation rages in food and energy and housing, Curitiba Brazil shows that Government can increase real estate property tax revenues while increasing real estate values,  build housing,  employ the poor, develop employment in green industries, and build small home offices for middle classes and formerly unemployed .  Amazingly the public parks eliminate flooding and provide green space ; and the public bus transportation serves the entire city; thereby, assisting all income sectors in the society to move ahead socially and economically.  It is a great example of vision and courage to solve  persistent social and economic problems in a free society. Easy to understand beautifully depicted with subtitles when necessary.",1211673600,3,730,5.54054054054054

2797903,5,B000OONRSY,"Each time I watch this film I find it inspiring. It shows what can be done to solve major problems (that are usually treated as intractable) through creativitiy and resourcefulness. With few financial resources, a big city's whole life is changed dramatically for the better. Housing, transportation, job training, rubbish collection, and poverty alleviation, are all tackled wholistically with tremendous results. I recommend this film be seen as widely as possible.",1203033600,2,467,5.591549295774648
2797904,5,B000OONRSY,"This film that tells what one city in Brazil has done to make a difference on the problems facing most cities. The film is great for it gives you a feeling that there is a chance. The one problem is that only about half is in English and the other has subtitles. It would have been better to have voice over, but the film is great",1196380800,11,330,4.015151515151516

2797906,5,B000OONRSY,"I would have never seen this film if I hadn't gone to the Santa Cruz Pacific Rim film festival. It's a movie worth passing onto others if they haven't seen it yet. a positive documentary about the city of Curitiba, Brazil and how they re-created their city into a healthy, green environment with the little money they had. It made me feel like so many changes are possible for a better place to live in America. Please consider this movie, its only an hour long!",1192665600,6,462,4.447058823529412
2797907,5,B000OONRSY,"This film is a must see for anyone involved in urban/regional planning, city councils, and concerned citizens. Curitiba debunks the myths that logical solutions to cities biggest problems only exist on paper or take billions of dollars to develop. A well made and inspiring documentary. When you see what they've done here, you will realize that our standard of living in the US is not really so high and solutions are far easier than our leaders lead us to believe.",1191974400,21,466,4.8375

8185810,5,B000OONRSY,"This is movie is great and inspirational for any urban planner. I really like the idea of the affordable homes.

The documentary ""A convenient Truth: Urban Solutions from Curitiba, Brazil"" is a very inspirational for an urban planner. This documentary demonstrated the many urban renewal possibilities that I did not think it were possible, especially in a city that the economic status is not great. This film documented innovations in the extents of transportation, recycling, affordable housing, social benefits, recreational areas, and landscape modifications.
 The transportation from minimizing motor vehicle usage was an eye opening. I rely on my car every single day; I always thought to myself I would not know what to do without my car. My main transportation is a vehicle, however after watching this documentary I think minimizing motor vehicle usage in my daily life would be feasible. I am afraid to use bicycle as another form of transportation because there's not designated roads for bicyclist. In Chicago, we share the road with the motor vehicles, which I think it is very dangerous especially the speed limit on many roads is between 25-40 miles per hour. This film showed that it would be possible to create roads that are just designed for bicyclist without sharing the road with motor vehicles. In this film the routes that are created specifically for bicyclist are safe and motor vehicle free. The roads that are specifically designated for bicyclist are separated from the roads for motor vehicles. This feature ensures and secures safety to the public to know that they are only sharing the road with other bicyclists.
 Moreover, the film also showed another way to reduce motor vehicle usages but constructing multi-unit homes without a parking lot. This is also another fantastic way to reduce motor-vehicle usage. Many multi-units and single-family homes either have a garage and/or a driveway. Driveways and garages are ineffective ways of land usage according to this film and I absolutely agree. In America, on an average, there are two vehicles per household. This would require a lot of land space to place these cars. While watching this film I was reflecting on my car usage, every time I drive my car I always have to think about whether or not my final destination has parking space for me. Driving a motor vehicle is not very environmentally friendly and everywhere I travel to requires a space to park my car.
Additionally, the exclusive lanes for buses are amazing. I personal dislike taking the bus because it is very slow. In Chicago, the bus shares the same road with bicycles and motor vehicles. All three different types of transportation on the same road with create a lot of traffic and inefficiently use of the road. In this documentary, Curitiba designated a lane for just buses, which reduce traffic, and the bus will travel easier without other vehicles being in the way.
 This film showed another great way to be environmentally friendly and different ways of recycling, including recycling left over food. I reflected on every time I prepare a meal; there are a lot of scraps I throw away from the vegetables I cut out from. In the future, instead of throwing it out I can compose all the scraps and it will turn into soil.

 Throughout the film I noticed Curitiba is very clean, whether is it in the urban or suburban areas. I wondered if they had a policy where the citizens cannot liter or if they spend a lot of money in sanitation to ensure their city is very clean. Then the answer came in the film. Curitiba buys the garbage from the citizens. I thought this is a great way to help someone during his or her economic hardship, instead of standing on the street to solicit. I think this would be a less of a burden on the government if people can earn money by just picking up trash on the street instead of getting aids from the government. It helps to keep the city clean and one does not have to feel that they are losing their dignity by soliciting.
 Curitiba is not a very wealthy city. Many people cannot afford very expensive homes to live in. There are a lot of multi-units homes. I thought that was a good and effective way for land usage. Many people living in the city are very busy with work and their activities in their life, they do not have time to buy a home and maintain their lawns. Multi-unit homes can increase social benefits between their neighbors, friends, and families. When homes are built closely to each other, it increases the chances that people would socialize with one another especially when one is living in a home where their wall is shared.
 Additionally, the single-family homes in Curitiba did not have a fence in their yard, unlike the homes in America. Most of the single-family homes in American have a fence surrounding their homes, which could limit the socializing with their neighbors. In Curitiba, the lawn space is shared amongst everyone. In America, many homes have very large backyards but the yard is only for a specific home. Also, I thought the idea of having a garden on top of the roof was a great idea. It reduces land usage and it helps the roof to last longer.
 Recreational areas are created from dangerous flood plains. This is a great way to reduce waste of land usage.
 In conclusion, I thought this film is made to deliver many encouragement and ideas to people and other cities. This documentary was made with a main focus of job creation. The film showed that majority of people is employed including people who are jobless. The people who are jobless could pick up trash and sell the trash. It film demonstrated encouragement to any entrepreneurs that they can start their own business with very little money. Most importantly this film presented various types of education to students and people. This film incorporated educational aspects of economic hardships, the transformation of geography, assimilation, and people cultivating ideas.",1395100800,,5968,4.842156862745098
8185811,5,B000OONRSY,"Amazing documentary, would highly recommend it to anyone who may be interested in urban planning, or who just wants to look outside the box when it comes to climate change. Arrived in record time; thank you :)",1378252800,,209,4.675675675675675

8185813,4,B000OONRSY,"This is a very educational DVD for anyone interested in Urban Planning, sustainability, the ""green"" movement, etc. The documentary covers the transformation of the city of Curitiba, Brazil from a poor, backward city into what they now regard as one of the most livable cities in the world. The filmmakers talk to the city mayor, along with the planners, architects and citizens who helped to implement these innovative urban solutions to the common problems of the modern, urban world. The issues covered include public transportation, recycling, affordable housing and landscape modification. Such innovations like special lanes exclusively for efficient buses, buying trash from citizens to clean up the favelas, and turning dangerous flood plains into modified public parks(not to mention using sheep to trim the grass!) are some of the interesting policies that Curitiba has utilized. I also found notable that the entire project was done with a focus on job creation, that is they made a concerted effort to put as many citizens to work as possible, encouraged entrepreneurship, and offered various types of education and job training for citizens.",1234656000,7,1153,5.375690607734807

8185815,5,B000OONRSY,"When governments such as the municipal government of Curticiba in Brazil have limited funds, governments can still be effective.  This is a fantastic overview of how a city can be green and cutting edge in transportation without much economic cost.  See why many municipalities have looked to Curticiba as a model of urban resilliance.",1221696000,,335,5.185185185185185

8185817,5,B000OONRSY,"Environmental changes you always hoped could happen are documented in this delightful, enlightening film.

Take an ordinary, not-so-beautiful, not-so-successful, non-environmentally positive town and think.  A vision to improve in 3 major areas became reality;  public and private transportation were revamped, housing created and improved, and recycling became a matter of public pride.  Beautiful parks were created on top of blighted areas and dumps.  The city of Curitiba became a destination instead of a place to pass through.

You look at the figures involved in these fantastic changes and say, gee, they look like ordinary people, and yet this whole thing is pure genius!

Then the whine is, Why Can't We Do This In The USA?  Is it the bureaucracies?  Is it too big an idea for us? It can't be the money -- the project's leaders tell how the projects became self-sufficient and paid for themselves in a short time.

I'm a teacher in Adult Education, where adults receive a High School Diploma (accredited) (not a GED) and I am incorporating this DVD in classes of Economics, Geography, Sociology, and Earth Science.  The more people who see it and are inspired by it, the better. I recommend it to everyone on the planet.",1220572800,12,1230,5.009852216748769
