It is so bad that I felt it was my duty to warn the rest of mankind.  It fails to be even one little bit interesting or entertaining.  You have been warned.",1228521600,,299,3.8360655737704916
8219658,1,B000VS6Q3G,"Dead Lenny attempts to be a screwball caper film with zany characters. It fails at its every effort. I'm willing to suspend disbelief in the name of a laugh, but there are way too many holes in the plot for even a comedy to overcome. I pity Joe Piscopo for being in this extremely cheap production.  There is an unintentionally funny fx moment to hold onto. Watch for the bullet holes in the cars towards the end during the big shoot-out.",1205884800,,438,4.407407407407407
