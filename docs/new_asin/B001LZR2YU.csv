very nice filmography. Music is good too not a bunch of rap crap or gangster garbage.",1396396800,,207,3.8372093023255816
8320208,5,B001LZR2YU,You know I am not sure why the other reviewer did not give this more stars.  I own pretty much every offroad riding dvd out there thats designed to improve riding.  This is about as good as it gets.  Nathan covers allot of skills needed to improve riding skills.  I would very much suggest this to help with your riding skills.,1298332800,,327,4.311475409836065
8320209,2,B001LZR2YU,"Camera work was excellent--and Nathan can sure as heck ride.  The chapter titles seemed to indicate that this would be an excellent instructional video for the intermediate level rider.  However, not a lot of thought was given to the content beyond laying-out the chapters.  He does not give many helpful insights for the beginner or even indtermediate rider.  The way he discusses the whoops are a good example of this.  He shows you how to blitz through the whoops at 35-40 mph riding a wheelie.  I will probably never be at that level, and someone who is does not need this video.  Great video if you want to see someone who can really ride a bike do his thing.  However, not great if you are looking for a solid beginner to intermediate instructional video.",1291507200,7,761,4.626865671641791
