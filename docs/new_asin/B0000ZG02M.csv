I have gotten my grandson hooked on Ultraman, to bad this series is not dubbed in English, but who cares!  It is a lot of fun & action for all ages!",1233705600,,288,4.296296296296297
1963702,4,B0000ZG02M,"At first I thought I was getting the original series, but this is new, no ""Hyata becomes...Ultraman!"". But it's still pretty good, as guys rolling around in rubber suits goes.",1155513600,,175,4.866666666666666

8004899,5,B0000ZG02M,Arrived at the promised time perfectly pakaged and with out blemishes perfect for my collection.,1473206400,,96,5.466666666666667
8004900,5,B0000ZG02M,Getting this volume and the gamera collection were a number one priority for me  but this dvd was my favorite.  Ultraman tiga may have some underwhelming special effects but the charm and tender moments make it really enjoyable.  Not only that but this retains the some of the tone the original Ultraman had. So for that i give this dvd an 8.5 out of 10 and i definitely recommend picking it up before it sells out.,1413676800,,415,4.434210526315789

8004902,5,B0000ZG02M,"Tiga was the first Ultraman I ever watched. Granted it was the crappy 4Kids dub, but thankfully this has the Japanese versions on them.",1393027200,,135,4.666666666666667
8004903,5,B0000ZG02M,been looking 4 this one....for a least the last 5 years!!!! REMEMBER WHEN THIS SHOW WAS SEEN ON FOX KIDS BACK IN THE MID- 90'S AND THEY NEVER FINISHED THE SERIES...SO I'M HAPPY U' GUYS SOLVED MY ULTRAMAN TIGA  PROBLEM AND I LOVE YA' 4 IT!!!,1388966400,,240,4.217391304347826
8004904,1,B0000ZG02M,"I adore this show so do not be angry with this horrible rating. 200$ or more for a dvd where the other volumes are about 19$ ? You have to be kidding me with this, nobody is going to shell out that kind of money! If they lowered the  price I'd buy this in a heart beat but for God sake 200$ you are out of your mind!",1349913600,3,316,3.6470588235294117
8004905,5,B0000ZG02M,"I ordered this volume as a present.  The delivery range provided was quiet broad, but the set arrived in time to be given as a Christmas present.  The item itself was in the condition described.  The set was given as a Christmas present, so I can't comment on the quality/playability of the discs, but will update the review if there are any problems.",1325376000,,351,4.5396825396825395
8004906,5,B0000ZG02M,"The second in a four-vol. set, this volume continues the fun started in the first one, Prophosy of Evil.  Getting this before getting the first makes me recommend strongly that you put this one up unwatched until you get the first an watch it, things will make more sense and the shows will be much more enjoyable - besides, these volumes come at a good price so it's worth having both anyway.  You won't be sorry.

This series is a romp, still full of goofy monsters, iffy special effects (mostly involving how aircraft actually manuver in flight, something that has always been a problem with japanese SFX), screwy writing, and one dimenstional characters (but the girl is adorable), the fights are well staged, Tiga follows his own rules well (you'll see), and they fight inside towns more.  This means building-smashing and that is what real kaiju fans live for!

This was a reasonably priced introduction into an Ultraman for the ""future"".  I'd recommend it as a must have for Ultraman ans Kaiju fans.",1310601600,5,1006,4.786127167630058
8004907,3,B0000ZG02M,"This is part of a four-volume series. I got lucky and bought two of the dvd's off of another site for less than five dollars each. Unfortunately, this and another one of the volumes I didn't get so lucky with. I'm not a fan of the show, YET...But this was a gift for my boyfriend.",1292976000,,280,4.109090909090909
