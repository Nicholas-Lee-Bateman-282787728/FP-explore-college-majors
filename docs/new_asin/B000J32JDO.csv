8148955,1,B000J32JDO,"This DVD was ordered by me, however I received a DVD titled Thanksgiving Dinner. A replacement DVD was sent to me, I received the same thing, with one exception, it wouild not play but the title was the same as the first one. Quality Information Publishers (QIP)are not sending out what one orders, nor are they replaceing the incorrect DVD with the correct one. I have returned both on them and I hope they issue me credit as requested. I will never do business with QIP again.",1161475200,5,478,4.505747126436781
