7902835,4,B000003K9L,"In the previous episode Tom Paris had a bad encounter with an alien world and in Episode 9 of ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" ""Emanations"" (Writer: Brannon Braga, Aired March 13, 1995) it the turn of Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) to have a similar bad experience.  Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Torres (Roxann Biggs-Dawson), and Kim are exploring an asteroid and come across an alien burial ground.  Not wanting to desecrate the site, Chakotay decides to do a quick archaeological study of the site and then return to ""Voyager.""  But before they can do so a dimensional portal opens and in the emergency beam up Harry is left behind, replaced by the body of a woman who had recently died.  Kim has switched bodies with the corpse and is now trapped in a burial pod on the planet of the Vhnori, where he is greeted as a visitor from their afterlife.  But when Harry tells them of the burial ground he saw, the Vhnori are understandably upset by the revelation.
Meanwhile, back on ""Voyager,"" the Doctor (Robert Picardo) resuscitates the dead woman, who is named Petra and totally freaks when she discovers she is not in the ""Next Emanation"" with her family members who have already died.  The problem facing the ""Voyager"" crew is to send Petra back and retrieve Harry.  However, this proves to be rather tricky at both ends of the conduit.  For those who like hard science with their ""Star Trek"" adventures, ""Emanations"" certainly provides them.  Brannon Braga combines the science theory with the religious beliefs of the Vhnori, which certainly fits with the emphasis on Season One episodes of ""Voyager"" on respecting the cultures of others at the expense of the ship and crew.  The result is not a great episode, but a solid one that reaffirms that the first season of this ""Star Trek"" series was the best of the bunch.",1054771200,,1802,4.746794871794871
