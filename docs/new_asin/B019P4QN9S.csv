8745632,1,B019P4QN9S,"The color was good, but the actor's voices were dubbed and the background music was changed.  What went wrong?  This was the worse updated movies I seen in years.  Your enhanced movies on Fire Stick are great, so I know it can be done.",1516233600,,235,4.295454545454546

8745634,3,B019P4QN9S,"Well, for a start, they have indeed done a pretty good job with the colorization, what spoils it is the blurry prints they used, and the re-dubbing of voices, and music. Could have been such a wonderful set if they hadn't ruined it this way.  Should take note of the crystal clear black & white prints that Olive Films are putting out of some of John Wayne's other 'B's from the same period, and with the original soundtracks, so it can be done!
A shame, because this set could have had such potential!",1491523200,2,502,4.397849462365591
