8469836,4,B005FAH1C0,"Five stars for Gluck's music, but this modernized staging is too artistically strange for me.  I would have preferred Baroque costumes or something that would look like a Greek tragedy, and I did not like the large headed actors who looked like bobble head dolls.
This is an opera based on a Greek tragedy and it is not a love story.  But, Gluck's very beautiful music seems to me better suited for a love story than a tragedy.  Gluck's music is as beautiful as Mozart's, and they were both German and they were influenced by each other's operas.
I recommened Susan Graham's il tenero momento - Mozart and Gluck Arias.",1387411200,,618,4.6

Based on a play"" Iphigenia in Tauris"" by Greek dramatist Euripides this presentation in four acts was composed by Christoph Willibald von Gluck (July 2, 1714 - November 15, 1787).

Even if this is your first foray into the presentation it would be good to know a little bit of the background so you he would have an idea of what the people are trying to say or do. It's very difficult with this particular staging to just dive right in and understand what is going on.

At the beginning of the Trojan War the goddess Diane had turned the wins against Agamemnon. To satisfy the goddess Diane Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter Iphignie. However Diane saved Iphignie and delivered her to Tauride, where Iphignie served the enemy Scythians as Diane's high priestess. The first act is 15 years after the incident and takes place during a storm that battered Diane's temple at Tauride.

You can look up the details ahead of time and then follow the presentation. I have to admit I needed the English subtitles. Maybe later I will not need them.",1353110400,3,1296,4.6960352422907485
