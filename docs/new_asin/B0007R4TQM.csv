2236289,4,B0007R4TQM,This is a very good documentary about Heaven and near death experiences.  It provides clear evidence of the fact that life after death does exist.  The graphics are very good and the audio is also very good.  It is a compelling documentary.  I only wish that it would have spoken about Hell a little bit more.  It only spent a couple of minutes on the subject of Hell but I guess that is to be expected since this documentary is about Heaven.,1358121600,,442,4.341463414634147
2236290,4,B0007R4TQM,"Interesting!  For anyone who is curious about near-death experiences, I think this documentary conveys the information quite well.  However, you might find the religious overtone (there's plenty of it) a bit too much if your mind is more open to science rather than a slave to sectarian views.  The reported data and implications are all there; the viewers, of course, have the freedom to arrive at their own interpretations and conclusions on the subject matter.",1328745600,2,463,5.1466666666666665
2236291,4,B0007R4TQM,"This is a fairly good documentary.  It includes some of the well known NDEs.  My only complaint would be that the actual experiencers didn't get enough time to give enough detail (in favor of commentator time).  But its a professional production and well worth the few green-backs I paid.  I wish someone would produce a quality DVD that is more experiencer and less commentary such that each experiencer discusses every detail he or she can recall.  And Producer, when you do it, go light on the A Minor, emotion manipulating music.  OK?",1269216000,6,538,4.793478260869565
2236292,4,B0007R4TQM,"... this is not hard analysis of religious it's rather surfacing. Movie follows its title. It is a search not a hard proof of some theories. Interesting out of body experiences especially clinical death for 28 minutes. Stories are illustrated so you watch story not just listen. I don't recommend watch extras. They are poorly made: repeating of episodes from film and more tendency to religion. But movie itself lives the questions of creation and God are opened for your own opinion. Movie gives the hope of meaning of life.
Good narrations, Ok graphic and good background music.",1253059200,3,581,4.938775510204081
2236293,5,B0007R4TQM,THIS IS A MUST HAVE DVD. IT GIVES A TOTAL INSIGHT ABOUT HOW SCIENCE IS NOW EXPLORING THE UNKNOWN. I LET SCEPTICS I KNOW REVIEW THE DVD AND IT HAD A POWERFUL IMPACT ON THEM. I HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THIS KIND OF DVD'S IN THE NEAR FUTURE.,1215993600,3,233,3.7755102040816326
2236294,2,B0007R4TQM,"I enjoy and study books and other media about the near death experience.  This particular CD, it turns out, comes from a Christian-based organization, and I returned it for a refund without opening it.  It is not obvious that this is so, it's not stated clearly anywhere, just a small reference initial, but it is - look it up in an engine search and see.  (you can't get a refund if you've opened it, or I would have watched it first).  My problem is that the NDE is a vast experience reported by people of all faiths or none, a very positive experience for the most part, and Christian church doctrines try to confine heaven and hell and NDE's to their perspective and deny others' experiences.  I just didn't want to spend the money on a CD with that basis.  Even so, many people do meet Jesus when they cross over whether they were Christian or not and their experiences are very beautiful.  It turns out that Jesus is a very unconditionally loving spirit to everyone, and there is no ""eternal"" hell nor judgment, just an extremely loving presence while the person crossing over judges his or her own life.  And this can happen even if the Spirit comes in the form of Jesus or not.  Perhaps I will rent this CD someday, but I don't need to own it.",1214870400,9,1251,4.404347826086957
2236295,5,B0007R4TQM,A wonderful documentary of real life near death experiences and their impact on how we might view life after death. This research all started years ago when medical doctors like Dr. Moody and Dr. Morse started to scientifically question what patients were telling them about their experience of leaving their body during a near death or death happening. Their patients stories are very moving. Phd Fred Wolf's information on quatuum physics and life after death is thought provoking. After seeing this movie I am feeling more comfortable with the subject of life after death and the change called death.,1115078400,51,603,5.101010101010101

8050914,4,B0007R4TQM,"I've read most of the main books on near-death experiences which is why this DVD was so interesting to me. It was intriguing to see the stories I've read acted out. It made the stories much more meaningful.

I especially enjoyed the story of the woman who leaves her body and sees a red shoe. The red shoe is later retrieved which in some ways proved the experience was real.

I found this DVD to be scary, enlightening, funny and at times it left me close to tears. Most of the main near-death experience authors were featured and interviewed.

This is not a scientific movie although there are quotes by scientists. It is a much more religious experience and explains a bit about heaven and hell.

I'd recommend this to anyone who has any interest in near-death experiences as that seems to be the focus of the documentary.

8050915,5,B0007R4TQM,Interesting topic that will create some great conversations!  I can't help but wonder why there aren't even more DVD's available on this subject matter!?,1361836800,,153,5.375
8050916,4,B0007R4TQM,"3 1/2 Stars. I liked this DVD better than The Lazarus Phenomenon.  I also watched Round Trip, which I give 3 1/2 Stars as well. Round Trip does not have much on the clinical view, just the near death experiences.  If you prefer just watching the ""experiences"" then Round Trip will be a nice DVD to watch.",1361577600,,304,4.315789473684211
