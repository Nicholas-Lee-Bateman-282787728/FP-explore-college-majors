8505077,3,B0012DP4PU,Would have been much better without the HORRID background music!  It sounds like 3 separate music tracks being played at once!  Sometimes you can hardly hear the narrator because the god awful music is so loud.,1476316800,,210,4.805555555555555

8505080,3,B0012DP4PU,"This documentary style video did not light my fire about Iceland.  We are planning a trip to Iceland, and this DVD did little to add to our excitement. It would interest a geologist or a natural history buff more than a traveler.  Probably not worth the price in my view, but it was worth watching once.",1342137600,,303,4.392857142857143
