265293,5,6300246876,"This movie was a critical and financial flop when it was originally released, but I loved it then and loved it now. It tries to resolve the problem of making a drama out of something when everyone knows what the  result will be--And does as well as could be expected--I find myself still  rooting for the officer trying to alert his superiors to the possibility of  an attack. The real star is the amazing model work--It's incredible to  realize that these special effects are done without computers!

265351,1,6300246876,"This is one of the finest movies of its genre. It joins a number of other such movies in the 1960s and 1970s. So, the quality of this movie is not the issue. I purchased this because I watch it every so often on TV and wanted to have a copy at hand.

Unhappily, I got a clinker. Background noise is distracting and the characters' voices are not their normal voices--they are greatly garbled.

I assume that I had the bad luck to get a bad copy. . . .

265353,5,6300246876,"It's one of *those* days. The kind of day when everything that could go wrong does. Such a day was 7 December, 1941 when poor planning,  gross mismanagement, and just plain dumb luck brought about the single worst military disaster in American history to the men stationed at the naval base in Pearl Harbor. The story you know from the history books, the memorials, and the survivor's memories. This film shows exactly that, without pulling any punches or changing any facts. Nothing is shown in this film that didn't really happen. There's no B.S. love triangle, no Matt Damon, and no hack screenwriter mangling the story.

""Tora Tora Tora"" (the signal to begin the attack) is one of the greatest war movies ever made. Although it was painful for me to see the Americans portrayed as borderline incompetent, while the Imperial Japanese  Navy (who are supposed to be the bad guys) are shown as well-trained, efficient, dedicated professionals, that's just the way it is. This film isn't for kids or for the faint of heart; just an unflinching, true-to-life drama for the ages.

And for all you men and women out there who served in that long ago war, I salute you.",1501891200,,1164,4.747524752475248

Tells the story from the point of view of both the Japanese and the US. There's some pretty good aerial footage and some pretty good depiction of ships being sunk in the harbor.

 But that's only a small part of the movie. I think the best part is the background information that tells the story leading up to what happened. And how both sides miscalculated and misunderstood each other.",1496620800,,546,4.561224489795919

265389,4,6300246876,"Was a great movie that chronicles the battle of Pearl Harbor.  BTW  Tora Tora Tora was the code the given in the battle to let the commanders know that total surprise had been achieved.  From the trailer and a bit of research I could tell this movie was heavily marketed on accuracy as well as telling both sides perspectives of the battle.

One might argue though it is hard to tell one side during the space of a movie. So it was a bit disjointed. The best part of the movie was the special effects. Very top of the line for the time.  In fact I believe it won an award for that.

The proof though is in the pudding. Midway and other projects borrowed footage from this movie.

Good for what this is which is a movie. Fairly accurate but very happy in the special features they included a documentary with experts examining theories about Pearl Harbor. This is great for adventure but I'd look at documentaries minus the propaganda films from the period or non fiction books If you want facts.",1490486400,3,995,4.404371584699454

265874,5,6300246876,"I bought this DVD over a year ago and wanted to view it on Pearl Harbor's anniversary. I remember seeing the movie on TV as a child and was glad to buy it years later as an adult. Seeing this film puts you almost in the middle of the action. it's almost as if you are a fly on the wall viewing many different perspectives of the attack.

I liked that the Japanese perspectives of the attack were given a fair frame. The Japanese were not portrayed as buffoons or in a stereotypical manner. We saw a group of proud men from perhaps the greatest nation in the world taking on another great nation. Absolute perfection!

We see how bureaucratic indifference as well as ignorance and even overconfidence played into America's greatest defeat. But seeing a group of intelligence officers in Washington, DC from both branches race against time to inform their superiors of what they have learned and what they think is going to happen is suspenseful. it was literally a race against time!

The actors in this film were great. Every person they cast to play the roles of real people were spot on. Everything was historically accurate as far as I know. I've read many books about the attacks and hundreds of articles. my major in college was history so I spent very much spare time reading about World War II. There can be no doubt in my mind that this attack was the greatest military maneuver in all recorded military history. Unfortunately for japan it led to their doom. A pyrrhic victory at best or a grave miscalculation at worst. I'm glad to have been able to view this on the 75th anniversary week of Pearl Harbor's attack.

I'm the 881st person to give this film a Five Star rating and the 1387th overall to review it. Buy it on DVD and you won't be disappointed.

265879,4,6300246876,"I've seen this film a number of times and am always amazed as to the great production quality of this epic tale of one of the worst days in world history. It is difficult to imagine the actual confusion shown in the film. However, having read many accounts of what occurred and why, the producers for the American portions of the film seem to have been fairly accurate. There was really no conspiracy on the part of anyone in DC. We wanted the Japanese to attack us first, as the countries' sentiment towards entering the war in Europe and beyond had been mostly leaning towards that of isolationism. That this attack occurred is not something the govt. planned on. Retrospectively, it occurred at the proper time. Our Pacific fleet had been decimated with the loss of so many battleships. But with the carriers intact we were able to secure ourselves in a couple of naval battles later on in 1942. The battle in the Coral Sea may not have been a victory, but we did inflict some serious damage to the mighty Imperial Navy. The real beginning of the end of Japan occurred at Midway Island. That naval battle was a tremendous victory for the US and it led to other naval battles in the Pacific with the Japanese at an overall disadvantage. Eventually, in April of 1943, with the interception of a critical piece of intelligence (we commanded the coding war which both the Japanese and Germans never really discovered), the US was able to shoot down Yamamoto's plane over a jungle which could be considered as one of the most important actions of WWII. Without Yamamoto at the helm of the Japanese efforts, the war was virtually lost for Imperial Japan. He had been reluctant to enter war with America, but once committed, he was their chief architect. Without him, their plan to win or even negotiate a settlement, would only lead to the unconditional surrender.

Today is the 75th anniversary of the Day of Infamy, as FDR described it in his speech before Congress on Dec 8.

We need to remember that war cannot bring about anything good. It takes years, decades, for people to put aside their hatred. People blindly follow despotic leaders into war with the hopes of conquering others to gain power and wealth. We need to remember Dec 7, 1941, but not in sadness or elation. It was a day when many people died, but it was also a day when we realized that no one should be capable of conquering the world. Remember the carnage, the death, the crying of mothers and wives and fathers all over the world and pledge in your heart to never follow that path towards destruction.

Our world is different today as we are great friends with the former despotic countries of Germany and Japan and Italy. Our threats to world peace come from different sources today. We (no one the world over) cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into a nationalistic fervor where we become paranoid with fear. Nationalism is beginning to show its ugly head once again, in Europe, China and even here in the US. We cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into this dreadful ideology. We are all the same, we need each other all over the world. We should never return to the hateful and warring times depicted in films such as Tora, Tora, Tora. Fear cannot run rampant. Focus on love.",1481068800,11,3250,4.6

265922,3,6300246876,"I agree with the consensus of most reviewers (not necessarily on Amazon, but everywhere, starting from the time of the film's release). This is a faithful, almost-to-the-last-second reenactment of the events leading up to, and then the attack on Pearl Harbor. Problem is that the director made no attempt to add any sense of impending doom to the scenes leading up to the attack (which make up most of the movie), so what we get is scene after scene of guys handing Very Important Pieces of Paper to each other, shot in the leaden directorial style of television movies of the era.

However, there's still a lot to enjoy about this movie as long as you can get through that. The actors do a great job. Martin Balsam is wonderful as Admiral Kimmel, eventually doomed to be blamed and stripped of his command for the laziness and ineptitude of those higher on the chain than him. E.G. Marshall as Col. Batton manages to add some lively suspense to some of the ""men shuffling papers around"" scenes. And S Yamamura (billed here as Soh Yamamura) does a great job portraying Admiral Yamamoto, who understood, the ultimate consequences of Japan's action even as he was instrumental in planning it.

Also, the aforementioned attention to detail is simply incredible, and the events and loss of life are handled tastefully -- perhaps a bit too sanitized and stilted, but I'll take that over the ridiculously over-the-top action-fantasy of Michael Bay's 2001 ""Peal Harbor"", which shows us events that just. didn't. happen. Not tasteful, not cool. So for all its faults, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" remains the best film about this event, especially for those who truly like to see history as it unfolded.

This was factual to the core. And when that scene came on where all those sailors were trapped below deck in a quickly flooding Arizona, that was so tragic and so sad and so filled me with anguish because it actually happened. This movie is a history book, much like The Longest Day. We should study and remember, lest we forget.",1475884800,,488,4.373626373626373

Fast paced story line! 3 T I  story  moves along  like a upside down turtle.
Lumbering along at languid pace.

Hollywood this movies is begging for remake!

I prefer this film over Pearl Harbor (2001) because of the dialogue and special effects. This movie does an extraordinary job at fleshing out the circumstances that lead to the United States being unprepared and the wave of nationalism that lead the Japanese into following through with their mission (even if the Japanese command appear to be hyper aware of their eventual demise).
The miniature sets blend perfectly well with live explosions and adds to the realism of the film, whereas Michael Bay's 2001 film was more concerned with epic moving shots. With all that being said, the pacing has not aged well and can be difficult to follow along with, especially for some teenagers and young adults and probably for some adults as well. When I show this in class, I show it in 15 minute installments, usually of parts of the movie that capture motivations and action. Highly recommend inside and outside of the classroom.",1463529600,,1091,4.902702702702703

Anyhow, this magnificent film has both a somber and informative tone because it shows the events leading up to and after  the Pearl Harbor attack from both the American military/American government perspective and from the Japanese military/Japanese government perspective.  A person has to have a strong mental constitution to watch the film because it does portray events leading up to some of the people that tried to relay warnings of the pending attack including a well-intentioned U.S. military official who actually predicted the attack before it happened , it was just the timing was a few days early. I want to write more but my heart is guiding me to refrain from writing more out of respect for people who have yet to see Tora! Tora! Tora!",1460851200,,908,4.734177215189874

266957,4,6300246876,"That combination is probably the best way of going about the subject matter.  Especially after seeing the debacle that was Pearl Harbor some 30 years later.  It's amazing how much better this movie got the feel of the period right, treated the material with respect, and still made for a much better movie watching experience.

Now some parts of the movie are rough.  Some of the performances are not great.  And some of the stunts and effects are a bit cheap and cheesy, in spite of most of the stonework having been done with real fighter pilots and planes.

In spite of that, this is still a fine watching experience front to back.  The movie has aged respectable, although it still does feel like an early 70's film.  It does try to keep the story as a whole historically accurate.  Yet it doesn't come off as dry and boring.  And even though it does invent and embellish a few things, by and large it's a pretty accurate movie portrayal of the actual bombing.

This is one I recommend for anyone who has a stomach for old movies with the 'let it play out' style of editing.  Also for anyone who has any interest in that part of American history.  It's a film that does show a few rough spots today, but it's still a movie worth watching, and it's a movie that hasn't been equaled or surpassed by Hollywood since its release.",1459814400,4,1329,4.4421487603305785

This movie is long (2.5 hours), and when you are used to modern quick-and-constant action films, it can seem a little slllloooowwww. But I found that this also gave me time to process - mentally and emotionally - what was going on. I usually want to watch a modern movie 2-3 times to catch all the nuances missed in the scenes flashing by. I felt like I only needed to watch this once and I got everything. (Doesn't mean I won't watch it again just because it was so well done!)

I was very impressed by the fairness in showing both sides accurately. In much of the '40s movies, the Japanese are always stupid and mean and the equivalent of suicide bombers, while the Americans are always top notch and amazing in every way. Here, you see Japanese who didn't want to go to war, but had to do so and thus did it well. While you also see American generals who let down their men by not taking warnings seriously. There were good and ""bad"" men on both sides, skilled and dumb, wise and fools. And this shows it all with great attention to historical detail.

Given the events, that story is quite gripping. The film helps with meticulous attention to period details from clothing to aircraft to shipboard scenery. Of course historical facts are always open to question. As another reviewer pointed out, one can wonder how much the Japanese really were concerned to avoid the onus of a sneak attack. The US Navy's official historian put it mildly: ""it apparently never occurred to anyone [in Japan] that to attack an unsuspecting people, when your government was still negotiating, and in defiance of the Hague Convention of 1904 which Japan had ratified, was dirty ball.""",1447027200,,790,5.328

267523,5,6300246876,"I'm writing this review,having just watched the 1970 Video version by 20th Century Fox. It has excellent sound and picture quality. This movie was a joint effort by the United States and Japan,and tells the story of Pearl Harbor from the viewpoint of both sides.
 This classic Pearl Harbor epic of 145 minutes is one of the most spectacular action/history films ever made,and details the stunning attack on America by Japan. It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards. This version of the movie includes a twenty minute documentary featuring archival news,photographs and interviews with military and political leaders and historians. Many of the questions surrounding who was at fault as well as conspiracy theories about warnings are answered as well as historians are able to.
On December 7,1941 Japan secretely attacked the US Fleet at Pearl Harbor,killing 3000,1100 alone on the Arizona. Several ships ,including the Arizona,the Okaloma and the Uta were destroyed. Several others were severely damaged ,but later repaired. 200 aircraft were also destroyed. However;to the chagrin of Japan,the Aircraft Carriers of the Fleet were not found ,as they were at sea.
 On December 8 th ,the United States declared war on the Empire of Japan as a response to this attack. On December 10,The United States declared war on Germany and Italy.
  The words of the Japanese Admiral,after the attack on Pearl Harbor proved to fortell the impact that the attack on Pearl Harbor would be;

"" I FEAR THAT ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE IS TO AWAKEN A SLEEPING GIANT AND FILL HIM WITH A TERRIBLE RESOLVE.""

For those wanting history, this really helps to understand the stupidity of peace time leadership. Its' brought to life very well although not really as much as during those times.  Husband Kimmel was destroyed over the attack.  It's good to know the history.  It's also good to watch how they captured so many things without any special effects.

The film is well-acted and directed, and to this day I am amazed that the production company was able to get so many aircraft of the right types to do the impressive aerial scenes, not to mention stand-in aircraft. If you're interested in the Pacific War or just like war films that make you think about strategy and tactics and those multiple factors which seem to screw things up, then this is the film for you.",1439337600,,755,4.5588235294117645

Despite the horrific beating inflicted on the U.S. Navy, the United States Navy responded quickly and fought bravely -- as did the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Air Corps, U.S. Marines and U.S. Cost Guard  -- to defeat the Japanese.  Sadly, today too many people do not know the sequence of events and (even) who was the aggressor (Japan) in this theater of operations . . . with some re-writing history in their incorrect versions of the hostilities.  One objection to the film is a technical flaw -- the sub-titles translating the Japanese dialog too often had white letters on a white background (e.g., Naval white uniforms.)",1434412800,,783,4.909090909090909

The new version of ""Pearl Harbor"" is a little too mature for him, but this one tells the same story on a level he can handle.  The battle scenes are truly spectacular for a movie of its era.  You can definitely see why it is a classic.  I was also very interested to discover that the two men portrayed in the more recent Pearl Harbor are actually in this movie as well and are actual figures in the real history of Pearl Harbor.  Would highly recommend it!  It is interesting to see that they expected movie-goers back then to be capable of reading as all of the Japanese scenes are actually in Japanese and have subtext!

It is a war movie of the fairly bloodless type: strategy and tactics as well as shooting and bombing. However, a recent re-watching made me wonder if the Japanese roles are overplayed and overacted.

To understand how singular this makes Tora! Tora! Tora!, one need only compare it with the 1976 film ""Midway"", which suffered from ahistorical subplots, an overhang of post 1960s political correctness, and growing historical holes; or the ghastly 2001 Pearl Harbor, which marked a new low in historical drama.",1431302400,,677,5.108108108108108

267912,5,6300246876,"As a movie, it isn't very good -- too much exposition, not enough drama. For special effects, it's somewhat outdated -- 1970 models as opposed to 2011 CGI imagery.

But for telling the story -- from both the Japanese and American sides -- of how Pearl Harbor happened and what happened that day, this film is hard to surpass. Instead of an insipid love triangle, it offers ranking officers wrestling with difficult decisions. Instead of an air battle lifted from ""Star Wars,"" it offers a fairly realistic depiction of air warfare. Instead of stock fictional characters from wartime World War II movies, it offers the real people who fought the battle.

If I'm going to watch a movie about Pearl Harbor, this is the film I'm going to watch. This tells me what happened. Michael Bay did not.",1430352000,,789,4.7101449275362315

Also, the soundtrack is another great Jerry Goldsmith one.  Infinitely better than the Pearl Harbor movie with the pulpy love story element that came out in 2001.

268001,5,6300246876,"This is by far one of the finest WWII films I have ever seen, and I enjoy watching it over and over.  The acting is superb.  The action shots are great.  It's said to be very factual and historically accurate.  I play a trombone.  Usually, trombone players in movies are faking it... Even the trombone players in the military band are ACTUALLY playing real trombone parts... Great pain were obviously taken to make this movie as historically and factually correct as possible.  Some of the scenery around Pearl Harbor is beautiful... Years after seeing this movie, I was able to go to Hawaii and see the actual ""pass"" between the mountains the Japanese pilots flew to pull of the surprise attack.  The scenery looked just like that shown in the movie... Tora Tora Tora is a classic-- timeless and historical. There are some subtitles for the Japanese spoken in the film, but it's easy to follow and actually makes the film more ""real.""  The more recent film, ""Pearl Harbor"" with Ben Affleck (sp) is great entertainment, but it has a love story threaded throughout it, detracting from the actual history of the event.  It's great entertainment, but Tora Tora Tora has it beat when it comes to depicting the actual events which took place of the assault on Pearl Harbor.",1429401600,,1268,4.7272727272727275

The Movie was incredible when I watched it as a child.  After a recent visit to Hawaii and visiting the memorial there, and touring the air craft carrier Midway in San Diego, I had to follow up with watching this incredible movie once again.  WOW!

I can't imagine even attempting to really stage something like this these days. The acting is good from a broadly impressive cast. Although unverified as authentic, Admiral Yamamoto's quote in the film, ""I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."" lends an ominous ending to the film.

268391,5,6300246876,"""Tora, Tora, Tora"" deserves its place as one the best ""recreation"" style WW II based films.
Pioneering use of Japanese writers, directors and crew and an excellent script and characters
make this film so strong. It avoids the specious ""FDR knew and could have avoided it"" nonsense
and, in fact, FDR is nowhere to be seen. What it does do is give an intelligent view of both sides.
The two books it draws from by Prange and Farago are also excellent and the screenwriters use this
material very well. Even though the special effects are not up to current CGI standards, they are
still very good--in fact better than the recent clunker movie ""Pearl Harbor!"" So, watch and enjoy and remember
the memory of ""a date that shall live in infamy.""",1427068800,,738,4.641221374045801
268392,5,6300246876,This is an outstanding that has a very balanced approach to showing the events surrounding the Pearl harbor attack from both sides.

268399,4,6300246876,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a dramatic re-enactment of the events of December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, thereby drawing the United States into World War II.  Released in 1970, this is a very good film that's written and produced along the same lines as several other war movies that seek to re-create significant battles with historical accuracy.

The first half of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" recounts how relations between Japan and the United States became  increasingly strained, and how this led the militaristic leaders of the Japanese Imperial Government to view the United States Navy as a threat to Japan that must be  ""dealt a fatal blow.""

A central section of the film recounts the brilliant detective work of two American military intelligence officers. They analyzed intercepted and decoded messages from the Japanese government to its embassy in Washington DC  and deduced that Japan was about to attack the United States. The scenes in which they arrived at their logical conclusions, and then tried to convince their superiors to act upon their findings, are among the best in the film - taut, suspenseful, and filled with a low-key but palpable tension.

The last forty-plus minutes of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" dramatize the actual attack on Pearl Harbor with stunning realism and historical accuracy.  On a warm, sunny Sunday morning in December 1941, Japanese ""Zero"" fighters and torpedo bombers wreak havoc upon the American fleet, leaving in their wake four battleships sunk and over 2,200 American military men and women dead. The scenes that depict the aerial assault are almost frighteningly realistic, without ever becoming gratuitously violent.

One unique aspect of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is how it attempts to tell the story of Pearl Harbor from the standpoint of  both the American and Japanese sides of the conflict. Japanese sequences are written, produced, and directed by Japanese filmmakers, and acted by Japanese actors speaking in their own language. (English subtitles are provided.)  American writers, producers, directors and actors were responsible for all American sequences.

 ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a surprisingly good movie imbued with good writing and acting, well-executed battle scenes, and high entertainment value. How well did  ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" convey what actually happened on December 7, 1941?  Very well indeed, I'd say.  It's a pretty good history lesson on the events of that fateful ""Day of Infamy. "" Highly recommended.",1426809600,4,2486,5.287531806615776
268430,5,6300246876,"Spectacle, Historical movie we all have to learn from.

In military, reporting to your next higher officer is critical not to judge

the responsibility follow to higher also.

Of course the special effects are not as good as the new Pearl Harbor movie, but considering it was made in 1970 it's not bad!",1425168000,,476,4.375

269046,4,6300246876,"This is an especially accurate portrayal of most of the main events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor--especially since the movie was done in 1970.  Since that time, more complete histories of the events of 1941 have been written with the release of previously classified information, the availability of personal diaries that several of the principal characters kept, and the availability of the content of the post-war Congressional hearings on the Internet.  What was surprising to see in the movie was the deliberate procrastination on the part of Chief of Naval Operations Stark and Army Chief of Staff Marshall in notifying the Army and Navy commanders in Hawaii after there could be no doubt in Washington, DC that the Japanese were about to go to war.  Recommended reading:  John Toland's 1982 book ""Infamy"" (1983 paperback), Robert Stinnett's 2000 book ""Day of Deceit"" and George Victor's 2007 book ""The Pearl Harbor Myth.""  Stinnett's premise that FDR followed a recommended strategy memorandum item-by-item is questionable; however, the rest of the content is compelling and consistent with the facts that have been established since 1970.",1424390400,,1157,5.266304347826087

There's no intertwining idiotic love story and no Doolittle raid on Tokyo. Historically it's very factual and it shows how many mistakes were made on the American side that allowed the attack to be a success. It also shows Japan's decision to break off the attack when they probably should have continued and done more damage.

Aside from the historical aspect, the acting is excellent and so are the flying and combat scenes. I promise you that you'll be amazed by the picture quality of this 45 year old movie.

269156,5,6300246876,"One of the best movies of World War II, it was created with the idea of showing an accurate portrayal of the attack and the events leading up to it, and telling the story from both points of view:  that of the Japanese and the Americans.  It does a great job on both counts.

The events leading up to the attack are complex and go back many years:  Japan had decided to become an empire, to follow the lead of the Western powers so she could continue to grow.  No one else liked that idea -- not those with colonies, nor those who were colonies.  The European powers were too busy with the war in Europe to do much of anything and that left the U.S. to try to persuade Japan to give up its ambitions.

The movie does a good job of covering this background and then showing the attack itself.  Some found that first part slow going; I did not.  I have read some accounts of the battle, but that was some time ago.  ""At Dawn We Slept"" by Gordon Prange is one good account and that is still available.  Another is ""Long Day's Journey into War"" by historian Stanley Weintraub, which covers the weekend of the attack and just about everything around the world that had anything to do with the war.  Unfortunately, it seems to be out of print.  I did spend some time on Wikipedia reviewing the battle:  the coverage there -- and undoubtedly many places online -- is very comprehensive with lots of detail.

As for this movie, it does a great job of showing the main points -- why it happened and what happened in the battle itself.  It was beautifully filmed, carefully crafted -- an epic film that is both entertaining and educational.  Easily one of the best WWII films of all time, you can learn a lot about the battle in 2 1/2 hours or so, even if you knew nothing about it beforehand.",1424044800,,1783,4.306306306306307

I like the way this whole movie is organized and directed. It's one of the few films I've seen with subtitles that actually enhance the action. While there are no box office super stars in the cast, it is still a powerfully acted film. I was 6 years old when this attack occurred. I can remember my maternal grandfather's demand for silence in our home as the reports came alive on the radio and President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared it a ""Day of Infamy."" This film brings the event to life by interjecting the events preceding the attack. For those who enjoy films concerning actual events, I recommend Tora, Tora, Tora.

269459,5,6300246876,"Detailed account of the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Peal Harbor.  This is actually three movies in one: 1) the planning of the attack by the Japanese Naval High Command; 2)  the poor planning and intelligence blunders by the U.S. Navy and civilian government; and 3) the actual attack on Pearl Harbor.  Each of these components could make a compelling movie by itself; but when combined they provided an dramatic and compelling account of what transpired on December 7, 1941. The first two components, lasting almost two hours, are derided by some viewers  as being too dry and academic, but I believe that speaks to their lack of intelligence rather than the production of the film.  The third component - the actual attack - comprises approximately the last 30 minutes of the film and is without a doubt one of the best war action sequences ever filmed.

Martin Balsam, as Admiral Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet head an all star cast on the American side which included E.G. Marshall, James Whitmore, Joseph Cotton and Jason Robards. The Japanese cast was headed by So Yasamura as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander in hief of the combined Japanese forces. All were excellent in their roles as was the large supporting cast. One issue I had was while the use of white subtitles, often against a white or light colored background, which made it difficult to follow the Japanese discussions.

This is without a doubt the best film relating to the war in the Pacific during World War II because it played the events straight, without any side stories getting in the way.  It set the standard that those that followed - such as Midway and Pear harbor - could not reach, primarily because they spent too much time on the personal crises of the films' characters.  If you only see one historical war picture, this is the one to see.",1409529600,,1866,4.734567901234568

I have to say that if you are going to get this on Bluray, you may as well get the Digital Book version. It includes pics of the movie and some of the men that were in charge during the attack on both sides. There are mini bios of some of the actors and real men that were involved and is worth reading. The Bluray itself is well done, looks and sounds great. For a 1970 pre CGI movie, this one is certainly a classic for all ages. I really like the layout of the menu as well. I have to give credit to Fox for having some of the best menus there is on Bluray. For me, the worst menus are MGM, if there are any. All you have is a ""pop up menu"" by pushing your remote key and it's basic at that.

You have the option for viewing the American Version or the Extended Japanese Version (which has a few added scenes with characters).

We all know the story. A surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941 that sent us to WWII with Japan.
Japan would eventually realize, that indeed, they did awaken a ""Sleeping Giant"" and fill him with angry resolve. They would go on to lose at the Battle of Midway and ultimately surrender after not only one, but two Automic bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The ""Enola Gay"" and the ""Bocks Car"" Bombers would effectively end hostilities with Japan.

I would also recommend some of the other documentary material that is included which illustrates the devastation of the attack not only on our military installations in Hawaii but also upon the civilian population (a factor often overlooked).  I believe this is a highly accurate portrayal that is historical and reveals our level of preparedness, the bureaucratic malaise within the military chain-of-command and government, and also the manipulative nature of diplomacy between Japan and the United States at the time.

  This movie chronicles the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and, the subsequent destruction of our seventh fleet ( the pacific fleet )
except for our aircraft carriers, some destroyers and a good number of our submarines.
  In my opinion, the Japanese made only three mistakes that day. 1. They should have hand delivered their declaration of war instead of going through our military mail delivery service. 2. They didn't immediately invade the Hawaiian Islands after the attack.
3. They completely ignored the Navy's dry docks and ship repair facilities. If they'd hit those and destroyed them, it would have taken the U.S. four or more years to refloat and repair those ships, in my estimation.
  So, for an accurate account of what led up to and followed the attack on the Pearl, see this movie or, read the book. You can't go wrong by buying this movie. --- The Anonymouse",1404432000,,1054,4.701086956521739

269857,5,6300246876,"This film depicts the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by a carrier task force of the Imperial Japanese Navy. This attack catapulted the United States ""off the fence"" and into WWII against  both Germany and Japan. The film tells the story from both the American and Japanese viewpoints, and is as true to historical fact as any Hollywood movie can be that isn't intended to be a pure documentary.  I suppose it would be impossible to re-make this film today: I don't think there are enough authentic, and airworthy, WWII aircraft still in existance. I suppose one could use CGI to simulate the airplanes, but the film wouldn't feel the same, I think. For a movie that was made more than 40 years ago, the video and audio quality in this DVD are very good, much better than the DVD of ""Midway"", which I also purchased from Amazon in this order. By ""very good"" I don't mean BluRay quality, of course, but at least the audio track is Stereo, not Mono (like Midway), and the color balance and luminance of the video is nice and clean.  For the $10 price, this DVD is worth purchasing if you enjoy the genre of WWII movies in general and haven't seen this one in a long time (or ever), and don't already have a copy of it on VHS tape. The Japanese dialog is sub-titled in English, so we aren't left wondering what the Japanese characters are saying.",1398211200,2,1351,4.461538461538462
269858,5,6300246876,I consider this movie as authentic on facts and very well paced. though the attitude of characters shown seem slightly exaggerated on both sides. A very enjoyable moviie,1398124800,,169,5.071428571428571

You will certainly have a better understanding of what took place and why, after you see this.",1397779200,,309,4.220338983050848
269941,5,6300246876,"This movie addresses the events that led up to and surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, on December 7th, 1941. The first half of the movie is slow - it revolves around the political maneuvers that preceded the outbreak of war in the Pacific. However, the Battle scenes in the second half of the movie are absolutely incredible. I'm not sure whether the director remastered old WWII footage or whether they were shot specially for this movie - but some of the shots are as life like as real war. The movie also contains, what I would consider to be, one of the finest Dogfights ever recorded by a Motion Picture camera. This dogfight is not to be missed!

I watched this movie nearly 10 years ago on TCM, and had almost forgotten about it, till I came across the DVD on Amazon. I was given an education in cinematography in the hay day of Hollywood - about how much could be achieved using real planes, real explosives and real stuntmen - in the days before Computer Graphics had become common place.",1397260800,,1012,4.530054644808743

The frustration of seeing all the missed opportunities that would have saved American lives can be painful, but we also see the Japanese frustration at the one bit of luck that went against them - the American ships that weren't in port that day, which became the dangerous foundation of the rebuilt fleet that was later victorious over the Japanese at Midway.",1395964800,,459,4.961038961038961

270069,5,6300246876,"01-22-14  This 1970 film directed by Richard Fleisher stars Martin Balsam, Joespf Cotton, EG Marshall, So Yamamura James Whitmore and a cast of thousands.  The cinematography was done by Charles Wheeler aND THE ACTUAL ATTACK SCENS ARE SO REAL AND LIFELOKE I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIEI DIN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE ""ACTING"" BACK THEN NOR DO I THESE DAYS.  THE REASON?  THIS IS LIKE GOING BACK IN TIME AND ONE GETS THE SENSE THAT YOU REALLY ARE THERE, At Pearl.  the film is also a valuable history teaching tool.  The undeclared but clearly tangible intent of this fine film is to tell the story from the Japanese point of view.  They attacked us, without waRNING, YES.  THEY DECIEVED US BY NEGOTIATRING FOR PEACE BUT PLANNING FOR WAR, YES.  THEY WERE THE Aggresors, yes, to be sure.  But, in their world view, they really had no choice.  We have learned thaT THE Japanese basically just wanted to take the resourses from SE Asia, and get home, without the interference from the American Navy.  We had recently moved our Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii less than a year before the attack of December 7th.  Our relocation was interpreted by Tokyo as an act of aggresion,  This film emphasizes the cultural divide between East and West, and our position meant war, and top Japan it was a defencive stradigy  aiming at defending the island nation against the massive military and economic might of the US.
  An opld friend of mine who had also just seen the movie in Chicago, joked that when the actor/pilot stated in amazement, at seeing the island not at all alerted and ready for them, that the audience stood up and cheered.  Only kidding, folks.  B ut, we do see the huge risk the enemy was making, and about two hours later, Yamamoto's famous line about waking a sleeping giant, has never been more appropriate.  In trhis, the film is a 5star featrure already.  And, we still have the entire battle to view.
  The several mini stories , like rthe radar station at Oppana Point and Kermit Tyler and the relentless detective work by Lt. Cmdr.  and Col. Bratton, played by E.G. Marshall.  Made in 1070, before computer graphics and computerized photograpfy, it seems so real.  Made for a mere 25.5 million it barely cleared 29 millin and was not a huge box office hit.  However over the years, the public warmed to it very much, and a lot of modern research has gone intoi the continuing investigation of the actual attack itself.  I never get tired seeingit, about once every12-18 mionths.  More than that and it wouldn't seem so special.  But, it is.  The modern ""Pearl Harbor"" with Aflack and Beckansele, as beautiful as she is, is a piece of trash, made for the gullible masses for whom the truth is a bore.  Believe it or not, the film ""Pearl Harbor"" used 8, count 'em 8, real working refurbished , mint condition Mitsubishi Zeros, the rest of the waves were computer generateed and explosions, according to the realveterans, massively exhagerated and over blown.

270202,5,6300246876,"I've read the reviews that gave this film only 1 or 2 stars. People said it was dull, boring, too long, the actors were too scripted and unrealistic, there was no story to it like there was in the Jerry Bruckheimer film, and on and on. Obviously people are very different about things and everybody has a right to their opinion.

But I think that these folks are missing the point. ""Tora!, Tora!, Tora!"" is to Bruckheimer's ""Pearl Harbor"" what ""A Night to Remember"" was to James Cameron's ""Titanic."" Most people who saw ""A Night To Remember"" when it came out, and also saw Cameron's ""Titanic,"" will tell you that as sensational as Cameron's version was of the event, ANTR was more like the real thing. And that's because that was the film producer's intention in the first place; entertainment was secondary. In fact, in ANTR, 4th Officer Boxhall, who was on the real Titanic and survived the sinking, was on the set of ANTR and was one of the consultants in the making of the movie, so it would be done accurately.

""Tora!, Tora!, Tora! was done much the same way. The producers used both American and Japanese military historians to try to portray both sides' point of view as accurately as possible. And once again -- the primary objective was to recreate on film an accurate portrayal of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. Entertainment was an important factor, but it was secondary to the primary objective. Furthermore, while the actors in this movie were not the most colorful or popular or charismatic in Hollywood, they were nonetheless very representative of the naval and army officers and top government officials of that time. They looked and sounded and acted the part very well. George Macready in particular was outstanding in his portrayal of Cordell Hull, Secretary of State.

And I can't close my comments without including this: the Japanese flagship in the real event was the aircraft carrier, Akagi. In the movie, you see the Japanese planes taking off of the Akagi's flight deck and on to their mission. But the ship you are actually seeing is the USS Yorktown CVS-10 -- MY SHIP, AND I WAS ON IT WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THE MOVIE. When the sequence of the flight take-offs begins, at about the 6th plane taking off, if you look quickly down at the very end of the flight deck, you'll see the number ""10"" on it, my ship's number. Also, right around that same general time frame in the movie, there's a nice aerial shot for a few seconds looking down at the Yorktown (Akagi), showing the entire ship. Anyway, every time I watch ""Tora!, Tora!, Tora!, it's kind of weird to be sitting in my recliner watching my ship and knowing that I am on it there in the movie!",1383609600,3,2685,4.6247379454926625
270203,5,6300246876,"One of the great historical films.  They put in the extra effort on this one and planes they made for the film still fly today.

 What I do know is that this film blows some other war movies out of the water (Midway ~ a romantic scenario for what purpose; Battle of the Bulge ~ historically incorrect; The Longest Day ~ A good film also but too many big name stars detract from the films premise: Pearl Harbor ~ Instead of this tripe, if you're looking for a love/war story watch From Here to Eternity instead).
 Pros:Tora Tora Tora stays with its intention all the way and delivers a knock out blow with some awesome special effect for its time.
 If you have this movie in another format, and own a blu-ray player, get this version. All but just a couple of scenes look amazingly better than the standard DVD copy I have.

270254,5,6300246876,"This film is based upon the actual events of the bombing of Pearl Harbour. Very often with American war films, they glorify the USA and demean others. This film in essence shows all, as it was.

It highlights the catalogue of errors on the US side that led to a ""Turkey Shoot"" in the harbour. It shows briefly the mistakes on the Japanese side. Overall the film is as true a record of the events leading up to this tragedy as Hollywood could create. The special effects are very good for the age of the picture. Overall it is a great cinematic triumph of fact over Hollywood romanticism, as followed in the later Pearl Harbour.

For any fanatic of war films, or as a historical document, this film ticks most, if not all the boxes. Great film based on sad events.",1375747200,,763,4.404255319148936
270255,5,6300246876,"The only reason why I can not say this is the best war film ever made is because in 1962 Darryll F. Zanuck produced ""The longest day"". Other than that, I believe there never was a better war film than ""Tora, tora, tora"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film follows the real history as much as it is possible, therefore there is no really any need to write about the plot. Historical accuracy of ""Tora, tora, tora"" is I believe as absolute as it was possible to achieve without using actual warships and planes which fought on this fateful Sunday on 7 December 1941.

""Tora, tora, tora"" doesn't enter into much details about the reasons for which Japanese leaders decided to make war to United States - we quickly enter the planning and preparation stage and after about 30 minutes the Japanese attack force (carriers ""Kaga"", ""Akagi"", Shokaku"", ""Zuikaku"", ""Hiryu"" and ""Soryu"" and their screen) leaves in greatest secret their base in Kuril Islands and starts for Pearl Harbor. The film then procedes quickly towards the day of the attack, which is then described in the greatest detail, beginning with 183 Japanese planes taking off from the carriers at dawn, with a quickly raising sun providing an unique background... This is one of the most powerful scenes in all the war films I ever saw.

The great idea of both producer and director to was to completely eliminate any not historical themes from the film - unlike in ""Midway"" six years later... There is no love stories, there is no development of characters - other than the description of real events there is virtually nada. To push even further this angle, it was decided to NOT hire any A-list Hollywood stars, but solid and experienced actors usually playing second roles or minor characters. As a result, with the exception of Jason Robards, all actors playing in ""Tora, Tora, tora"" were and are rather little known - but the result on the screen is very pleasant indeed!

""Tora, tora, tora"" is THE film about Pearl Harbor attack and it is infinitely better in all aspects than this ridiculous 2001 Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer ""Pearl Harbor"" flick. Amongst many of the treasures of this film is a large part devoted to the Japanese involved in this attack: Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, grave and heartbroken at the idea of starting a war he is afraid he can not win; Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (great casting by the way - Eijiro Tono looks really very much like real Nagumo), cautious and anxious; Commander Minoru Genda, the main planer of the attack, exhausted and emotionally wrecked by the stress and last but not least, the enthusiastic and exuberant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, the man who lead the air attack and send the message ""Tora, tora, tora"" informing his superiors that the surprise was achieved and the attack will be unopposed by American fighters.

I can not praise this film enough so I will stop here and simply conclude by saying that I saw ""Tora, tora, tora"" many times and I NEVER got bored! This is a major masterpiece, a model filmmakers willing to do war movies should study and imitate. To buy, see, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!",1375660800,,3146,4.786372007366483

270334,5,6300246876,"I have seen this movie before, but learned a lot from the companion disk that I never knew.  There have been many movies about Pear Harbor, but this is the most accurate.
This film addresses the attack from two different perspectives: the American and the Japanese.  Three different Japanese directors, including Kurusawa, directed the Japanese portions.  Japanese wrote the Japanese part of the screenplay.  The planner of the attack, Commander Genda, wrote that portion.  Japanese pilots were interviewed for their perspectives.  After their surrender, the Japanese had to destroy all their offensive weapons, so there were no Zeros to use for this film.  The Zero was a copy of an American aircraft, so all the Zeros are American planes with Japanese markings.  All the locations where the events happened were used.  The Japanese built a full scale carrier and battleship.
The American parts were directed by an American.  American sailors and pilots who were there had input in the script.  Once again Hollywood portrayed events in its way, but then actual survivors told what really happened.
The Americans built a full scale replica of the Nevada and partial replica of the Arizona.  The rest of the fleet were miniatures that were viewed a pilots perspective.  All the original American locations were used.  Pearl Harbor was an American defeat, because of arrogance and stupidity of the American military mindset of the time.  The Japanese were not seen as a serious threat, but as comical and incompetent.  The movie was made so that America would not become complacent again.  I do not know if we learned that lesson.  More Americans were killed on 9/11 then at Pearl Harbor.",1374278400,,1686,5.047101449275362

270336,5,6300246876,"There have been several films over the years that have dealt with the actual attack that brought America into WWII.  I'm not talking about such seminal movies as ""Here to Eternity"" which used December 7th just as a backdrop for a story about people and relationships in and around U.S. Army life at Pearl at that point in time.  This story is about the event itself; U.S. Military intelligence and its then limitations & naivet; Japanese planning and thinking, as short-sighted as it was!  It is an intelligent and somewhat thorough attempt to show, explain, and portray the why & how of what happened whereby the event itself is the central theme and not a parade of fictional side plots.  In its attempt it presently is arguably the best representation of that brief period of time up to and the attack - a chronological telling, of how it came to pass.  I believe it a fair assessment to laud it as good a visual presentation as ""At Dawn We Slept"" is a written account.

The acting is for the most part superbly understated as was the maker's choice to avoid BIG-Name stars - unlike Midway, which by economic necessity unfortunately there caused the producers to detract from the consequential events.  In this the late E.G. Marshall and Marty Balsam, and in a lesser role James Whitmore deserve recognition as personages central to the actual flow of events, as well as several others including Joseph Cotton and the like in more-or-less cameo roles, and a host of fine Japanese & Asian-American actors.  Jason Robards, an otherwise stellar actor, interprets his role as Lt. Gen. Short somewhat flat, simply as a martinet rather than that of a career officer late in his career whom gets caught in the ultimate trap for military professionals: ""Generals always try to fight the next war on the basis of the last one""- here with little or no appreciation of change,- technology & capabilities, impact on methodology, etc., especially that of airpower.  The ""Peter-Principle"" shortcoming of having probably risen beyond his summit of capability through no fault of his own.  (Where Admiral Kimmel (Balsam) was relying heavily on being told in near step-by-step detail precisely what to do, General Short became inexplicably fixated upon sabotage & subversion when there wasn't a single instance of evidence to support such!)

Sidebar: What is curious is that the screenplay misses the (an) opportunity to explore - even superficially, the fact that in the course of the `Billy Mitchell Court Marshal' then Col. Mitchell laid-out in somewhat stunning detail how the ""Japanese"" would attack ""Hawaii"" at ""Pearl Harbor"" from the air at ""dawn"" with ""no warning"" and succeed at ""sinking a fleet"" using ""airpower alone!""

Tiger, Tiger, Tiger (""Tora, Tora, Tora) is the finest motion picture about the actual attack on Pearl Harbor yet made, well transferred to DVD - especially the audio, and well worth having - especially at the now-a-days bargain price.",1372809600,,2951,4.963488843813387

270390,5,6300246876,"Upon its 1970 theatrical release, this film was met with indifference  and, considering its production expense, was a major box office disappointment. Perhaps in large part because of two factors, the still ongoing Viet Nam war, rendering a war weary public reluctant to embrace a big budget war film, coupled with the release of another yet slightly different war epic with star power and a more centrally driven character line. Patton, ironically released from 20th Century Fox as was Tora! Tora! Tora!, dominated 1970's box receipts as well winning the Academy Award for best picture as well as best actor for George C. Scott. Not the best marketing ploy for Fox at the time.

In retrospect Tora! has become able to better stand on its alone for its accuracy and attention to details previously unknown to the general public surrounding the details leading up to the attack upon Pearl Harbor. The intelligence gathered from fragments of information gathered from G2 and Naval Intelligence and the two officers assigned to the task was facinating and brilliant considering what little concrete information with which they had work with along with a heavily ticking clock builds suspense, no easy task when the audience already knows the eventual outcome.

Martin Balsam and Jason Robards overshadow who emerge as the real stars of this film. I refer to E. G. Marshall and Wesley Addy as Colonel Bratton and Lt. Cmdr. Kramer respectively as the two officers who solve the puzzle and frustratingly try to convince the American military leaders as to what was about to happen and encourage them to take action in the field. The other star is the film's special effects of the attack created in a time of no CGGs or other computer generated images. All were physically created by stunt men and stunning pyrotechnics which we may see the like ever again. The images captured on this film are eye opening for their spectacle and dangerous destruction, for most had to be shot in one take.

Lastly, and importantly, the film is told from both the American and the Japanese perspectives adding increased credibility to the events depicted. As the details emerge from both sides as they head on a collision course adds to the suspense as to what comes next on the road to ""a date that will live in infamy."" If one only knows that date and the result, the details revealed leading up to that result can be fascinating as well eye opening as to how the actual events unfolded and the time in which all took place.

270569,5,6300246876,"I remember seeing this film during its original reserved-seat engagement at one of the Golden-Age movie palaces on Broadway.  I thought it was a spectacular film.  I was always surprised that the film received so many mediocre reviews from snobbish film critics and was a major financial flop.
I watched it again on blu-ray the other night and still consider it to be a great achievement.  The actual attack scenes are quite incredible when one considers this film was made way before CGI.  (I think the attack scenes in ""Pearl Harbor"" are spectacular also, but one could do a lot more with that CGI today than in 1969 when this film was made.)
There are so many things that are great about this film including the great Jerry Goldsmith score that builds up the suspense as we get closer and closer to December 7th.  I also liked all the character actors used to portray real people in this film: E.G. Marshall, James Whitmore, Joseph Cotton, Richard Anderson, Neville Brand, etc., a terrific cast of wonderful actors.
I owned the film on DVD before getting the blu-ray for $9.99 from Amazon.  It is a terrific buy, the picture and sound are way better and the book included as part of the blu-ray is very nice.  Extra features include the ""AMC Backstory"" on the making of the film.  (I really used to enjoy watching those on AMC Saturday nights,) the History vs Hollywood episode on this film vs. the actual Pearl Harbor attack and another documentary on December 7th.  These are also all excellent.  The blu-ray features both the Hollywood cut of the film and the Japanese cut which is a little longer.  (I watched the Japanese cut.  It was nice to see some scenes that I never remembered seeing before.)
This film has been re-evaluated in the years following its release and it is now considered to be a much better film than it was considered when originally released.
I highly recommend picking up the blu-ray of this spectacular film",1338422400,5,1939,4.687315634218289
270570,5,6300246876,"I'm old enough to have seen this film when it was first released. Not only that, I saw it in its first release at a drive-in theater! Imagine that.

I hesitated buying this Blu Ray version of this movie as I had purchased the 2-DVD collector's edition only a few years ago for $10 at the local Target. Fortunately, amazon discounted this BD to a ridiculously low price, so I jumped.

The picture quality on this disc is outstanding. Though I ordered this BD in February, I didn't get around to watching it until Saturday (5/26/12) as part of my annual Memorial Day line-up of movie classics. I have to say it was a great experience, particularly the sound, which I fed through my surround set-up. It's amazing how much better the musical soundtrack comes off when it's liberated from sharing space with dialogue and sound effects when listening only through one's built-in TV speakers.

Yesterday (5/27/12), the film was played on TCM as part of their Memorial Day line-up, so I watched it again, which afforded me the opportunity to do a pretty good A-B comparison. It was obvious to me that they were not using the BD version as their source for their b'cast, and the differences were stark. Overall, there was no comparison - get the Blu ray version of this film if you want to see it in all its glory. Specifically, though, the older version had a better placement of the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. The BD version has them placed as two sentences, with one sentence imposed over the picture and one sentence sitting below the frame. The sentence that is on the picture can be very difficult to read, which is funny, as the older version has the subtitles superimposed entirely over the picture, and there is no problem reading them whatsoever.

BTW - there's a scene right before the start of the attack where the crew of a ship raises the flag. One of the sailors rings a bell 4 times before the ceremony starts. When the actor portraying the sailor finishes the bell ringing, he takes a few steps backward and trips over the deck, nearly falling on his butt. For as expensive as this film was to produce, I'm surprised they didn't reshoot that scene.",1338163200,2,2166,4.603626943005182
270571,4,6300246876,"The picture quality is excellent on this release. The quality of the image is very far removed from the blurry broadcast image I last saw many years ago on tv. The pin sharp picture and great colour depth gave a feeling of watching a modern reconstruction of events.

Occasionally the use of models is evident but this did not spoil my viewing experience. This is a slow moving end to end account of events from both the American and the Japanese point of view. If you prefer fast paced action movies than I would not recommend this movie to you.

The quality of acting is very high throughout the film without any distracting or unbelievable ""star"" actors.

The booklet style of packaging offers a decent amount of information about the movie and its making as well as many behind the scenes photos.

The Japanese actors speak in Japanese which neither surprised or annoyed me personally. I know that some people prefer a dubbed movie over subtitles so I considered it worthy of mention.

This movie gave my teenage son a chance to understand what happend at Pearl Harbor in a much broader historical context without the blanket of wartime propaganda that seems to still linger over many peoples perception of the event.

A beautifully shot movie with breath taking aerial footage. A slow burning pace leading up to many great action sequences and the revelation of why and how this came to pass.

The video part being in BR is a big improvement over the older DVD. The audio is even more outstanding which together presents Tora-Tora-Tora as it should be seen and heard. The disc has both American and Japan versions with the japan version longer with additional scenes. But I found the ""extras""....the documentry and the making of Tora-Tora-Tora really intriguing and with some interesting facts. There's a gallery with various stills from behind the camera, actors and sets. Some interviews with those ho were actually there that day. Want to know how they did the ships and get all those planes....it's there.

Tora-Tora-Tora is not full of masterful CGI effects, wow you with a great hollywood story or be used as some reference material to show off your HT to friends. What it IS, is a solid good cross of movie & documentry that's as close as you'll get to the real protrayal of Pearl Harbor without some added love story or CGI effect thrown in. It will leave you asking a lot of ""what if's"". I would be all for it if someone wanted to do a remake of Tora-Tora-Tora with today's wizardry in film but I fear political correctness would ruin it's facts and history. For a war, history buff or the those facinated with the history of that infamous Decmber 7th at Pearl Harbor, it's a must buy.

How different to the post 9/11 ""Pearl Harbour"" where the Japanese are dehumanised and presented as heartless villains. It shows how far back into paranoia, zenophobia and flag - waving America slipped after 9/11.

270629,3,6300246876,"For years Hollywood has made movies that boosted morale rather than portrayed the truth (more or less) of what happened during historical events. Recently TV series have taken to correcting that but perhaps gone overboard. So where, other than through diligent research, can one find out information about these events? Sorry but that is the only way. But on occasion film makers do attempt to give you as much truth as possible. TORA TORA TORA is one of those films.

The movie recreates not just the day that Pearl Harbor was attacked but the events that led up to it days prior. It also presents the events from both sides of the Pacific, what the Japanese were thinking and planning and how the U.S. bumbled things with its bureaucratic red tape. Could things have played out differently? According to this film, yes.

The film shows a peacetime Pacific where preparations were being made on the chance the Japanese might start something. New island commander Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) does things his way. His biggest concern at the time was sabotage and spies on the island. This led to numerous errors on his part that involved things like placing the planes close together so they could be watched easier instead of further apart where they could take off if the island was attacked. No one believed that could happen.

Adm. Husband Kimmel (Martin Balsam) does his best to stay on top of things but communications between the island and the mainland were not top priority it seems. Messages he sends along to the mainland are passed from hand to hand without priority. The same is true of information passed along from office to office in Washington. A note of a decrypted message between the Japanese would have given those on the island ample time to prepare for the attack. It sat in a going out tray at a telegraph office because the military communication system was down at the time.

The Japanese were no better off. While the military command was all ready to go to war, they were being blocked by government officials on their end. These same officials bungled their own jobs as well. The biggest example is when the ambassador in Washington is supposed to deliver a declaration of war to the U.S. at a predetermined time. It doesn't happen because the typist is taking too long to type the declaration and then their meeting gets pushed back. Had it happened on schedule the sneak part of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor wouldn't have happened.

The movie focuses on many of these points but to simply have bureaucrats walk down hallways and pass messages along would result in one boring film. It moves back and forth between the planning on the side of the Japanese and the red tape functions of the military on our side. But the film makers spared little expense when it came to depicting the attack. A combination of archive footage, models, miniatures and more were used to recreate the devastation of that day and you feel pure terror along with those onboard the ships that sank. It never lingers on gruesomeness but does make you realize what happened that day.

The movie has just been released in blu-ray format and the picture offered is clean, sharp and well done. Extras include looking back at what it took to make this film behind the scenes and historical pieces as well.

Made during the last days of the Vietnam War and during when anti-war protests were the rage, it was a bold thing for a studio to do in 1970. But the movie doesn't encourage or defend war; it just shows what happened on that day in 1941. Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, this one doesn't focus on fictional characters to present what happened but instead focuses on the story of Pearl Harbor itself. And with a generation of children growing up who have no idea what it meant, this is a movie that they should make a point of viewing.",1332806400,29,3861,4.6607929515418505

The aspect ratio is 2.35:1 as advertised. Video quality is very, very good, but there is some fine grain in many of the scenes.  Detail is fantastic.  I can't imagine the DVD having even close to the video quality of this Blu-Ray.

The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound was good, but disappointing at the same time.  There just wasn't much, if any, surround sound.  I wasn't aware of any noticable sound coming from the surround speakers, but there might have been a little.  There should have been a lot, with all of the planes flying over your head.  Sub-woofer bass, which I think I noticed a little bit, just wasn't strong enough.  But, for an older movie, the sound was pretty good.  There was a lot of stereo separation between the front speakers.

The sub-titles were annoying, partially because the movie was 2.35:1, and the first line of the sub-titles were within the movie, and the second line was in the black bar below the movie.  The first line was hard to read at times.  It would have been better if they would have fit all the sub-titles in the black bar.  I don't like sub-titles, and agree that they should make everyone speak English, just to make it easier to enjoy the film.

My main complaint is the sub-titles on the Japanese version are not always visible.  One would think the film editors at 20th Century Fox could have made sure that the bottom of the sub-titles didn't get cut-off the bottom of the screen!  One can see the top of sentences when the text is long enough to have two lines of text, but the bottom line is cut-off.  On one line of text sub-titles, one can't see any of the text at all.  This is a major problem, because on the Japanese version there are a lot of conversations between Japanese speaking actors, that unless one understands Japanese language he will not be able to understand what the actors are saying.

270743,4,6300246876,"Americans never really understood how they were dragged into World War I during the period from 1914 to 1918; and the horrors that humanity went through in that period, in which thirteen million people lost their lives, made the United States, which, like the rest of the world, was to suffer further horrors in the Great Depression of the 1930s, wary of entering international conflicts that had nothing to do with them.  Even the rumblings from Adolf Hitler in Germany meant nothing to the U.S.--for a while, anyway.  When Japanese emperor Hirohito ordered a surprise attack on America's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, however, America woke up to a new kind of reality, as World War II was bought to their very doorstep.  This was the story told with frightening accuracy, from both sides of the conflict, in the multi-national 1970 World War II epic TORA! TORA! TORA!

Based on Gordon Prainge's book ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", and Landislas Farago's book ""The Broken Seal"", this well-mounted movie, which, at a cost of $25 million, was among the most expensive films made in Hollywood up to that time, focuses, on the way the Imperial Japanese navy prepared to do what its emperor was ordering of it, and the way the American military staff in Hawaii were trying to understand what they were up to.  The truth of the matter is that America and Japan had both been at odds for some time over various issues; negotiations between the two countries were going on for much of 1941; and if Japan could not get what it considered a fair deal from a country that was still largely considered isolationist and inferior in the eyes of the world, then it would take it all by force.  As far as the American military was concerned, there was no indication that a sneak attack of any kind was imminent on them; and it was assumed diplomacy would work things out.  It then came through a deciphering of secret Japanese communiqus that an attack was under way; but by the time the deciphering was in the hands of the Pacific fleet staff, it was too late.  Pearl Harbor was virtually destroyed in a matter of two hours; numerous battleships, including the Arizona, sank to the bottom; and almost 2,500 people were killed.  It was the greatest single loss of life in any attack on the United States...until September 11, 2001.

It would have been tempting for 20th Century Fox, the studio that funded and distributed this film, to make it a jingoistic piece of propaganda and paint the United States as the victim (even the 2001 blockbuster PEARL HARBOR, a near-enough remake of TORA! TORA! TORA!, flirted with that); but, like on its 1962 classic THE LONGEST DAY, it avoided doing so.  Instead, thanks to the participation of two prominent Japanese directors, along with veteran U.S. director Richard Fleischer (THE BOSTON STRANGLER; FANTASTIC VOYAGE), the film looks at the events leading up to December 7, 1941 from each side of the conflict, with the Japanese, including their revered Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Soh Yamamura), anxious to strike but knowing full well what it may mean for their empire in the end, and the Americans misreading Japanese intentions and disregarding the numerous warning signs until they are backed into a corner.  The film gives equal credit to both sides, as befitting as accurate an account of history as Hollywood can muster.

Featuring the Oscar-winning special effects work of L.B. Abbott, A.D. Flowers, and Art Cruickshank, TORA! TORA! TORA! also features solid actors like Jason Robards, Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, Richard Anderson, George Macready, James Whitmore, Wesley Addy, Leon Ames, and others rounding out a fine cast, along with Goldsmith's always dependable scoring genius, which here combines American and Oriental themes in a unique way.  By avoiding the romantic sub-plots and the gung-ho theatrics of the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced and Michael Bay-directed PEARL HARBOR, TORA! TORA! TORA!, though an unavoidably lengthy movie, makes itself stay truly memorable in the way it sticks with the historical facts; and it will certainly make the viewer wonder just how certain wars throughout history get started.  In the case of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to six months of victory for them in the Pacific before they were ambushed at Midway in June 1942, it was a combination of misreadings, misunderstandings, and (on the part of the Japanese) the nerves of riverboat gamblers that made history happen.  And as TORA! TORA! TORA! makes abundantly clear, such is often the way history gets made.",1324944000,,4575,4.953002610966058

The picture quality looks good. Only in few scenes on the beginning are any few scenes a little bit corny. The Color are wonderful.

The Bonus-Features are very interesting and contains Fox News from 1941 about the Attack.

The release is a digibooklet with infos about making the movie and the planes.

270787,4,6300246876,"IMO, this is the best movie on Pearl Harbor. It totally blows away the more recent Pear Harbor film with Ben Affleck. They totally screwed that movie up by intertwining it with a flipping soap opera! Sure, the special effects in the battle scenes are great, but it's only half good. The attack on Pearl Harbor should not be romantisized.
I first saw Tora! when I was in the 7th grade many years ago. It was great then and to me it gets better with age.
As far as the Blu-Ray transfer, it is only slightly better than the standard DVD (I have both). The colors are better, but it looks quite grainy and filmy, but for a film from the seventies, it's not bad. I think these studios will throw any old thing on a Blu-Ray disc and call it ""high definition"". To do it right, they need to do a ""4K"" restoration where they scan each frame and clean it, then digitize it.
The packaging is awesome. The disc jacket is itself a little full color book.",1324512000,3,941,4.262569832402234

The American and Japanese approach to the final show-down are related very well, with the necessary detachment to maintain objectivity and yet with enough passion to make the viewer feel involved. I had read a lot about these events and still, I felt emotionally moved. There were reasonable people on both sides in 1941, and war might have been avoided if they had prevailed. Among them, the towering figure of Admiral Yamamoto is central to the whole story.

This movie is from 1970, so no computer generated imagery, no special effects really, at least not as we are accustomed today, but lots of real planes flying and real fires!

The Blue-ray quality of this set is stunning, incredible for a movie that is 40 years old, and the extended Japanese cut makes for a more thorough experience.

270792,4,6300246876,"I feel that the release by 20th Century Fox of the Japanese cinema version of Tora! Tora! Tora! on Blu-ray and with an additional ten minutes of Japanese produced scenes warrants further attention directed largely at its historical content. The Blu-ray is noticeably darker and the grain heavier in scenes such as the Japanese aircraft launch from the flagship Akagi in the pre-dawn of December 7.

Tora! Tora! Tora! is a gripping and mostly accurate account of Japan's treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the events that preceded it. Fox intended that the film would be both historically accurate and balanced. To achieve that balance, Fox arranged for American and Japanese producers and directors to film their accounts of the Japanese attack independently and then blended both accounts into one story. For greater realism, Fox wisely chose to exclude top film stars, such as Charlton Heston or John Wayne, and selected a cast of fine character actors for the American and Japanese roles in the film. The American account appears to have been largely drawn from Professor Gordon W. Prange's authoritative history ""At Dawn we slept"" and does not shy away from depicting the succession of blunders that should have alerted the American armed forces in Hawaii to the approaching danger.

The logistical problems facing the producers were very challenging. When the film was being made in 1970, computer generated images (CGI) had not been invented. No Japanese aircraft dating from 1941 were available except in museums. So Fox converted American Vultee BT-13 and North American AT-6 Texan basic trainers to look like Zeros, Aichi ""Val"" dive-bombers, and Nakajima Navy Type 97 ""Kate"" level and torpedo bombers. The effect was so realistic that one WW II Japanese Zero pilot thought the Zeros used in the film were genuine. The Japanese built complete full-scale replicas of Admiral Yamamoto's flagship Nagato and the carrier Akagi on the beach at Ashiya airforce base. Fox built a full scale replica of the battleship USS Arizona mounted on barges. The Fox miniature department built 29 American and Japanese warship models - some as long as 40 feet. The pilots who flew the Japanese aircraft replicas over Hawaii in this film were American. Japanese actors only featured in aircraft close ups.

""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is divided by an intermission into events leading up to Pearl Harbor and the actual attack on Hawaii which has been brilliantly filmed, and unfortunately, resulted in the death of one pilot. I agree completely with the views of film reviewer Leonard Maltin who described the film in these words: ""Well-documented screenplay shows major and minor blundering on both sides, then recreates attack with frightening realism. Well-made film creates incredible tension. Oscar-winning special effects."" (2008)

The historical context of the film is probably well settled. Tensions between the United States and Japan had been rising since the Japanese attacked China in 1937, and were not helped by the sinking and machine gunning of survivors of the American gunboat USS Panay in the Yangtze River by the Japanese in December 1937. The American government had responded to Japan's brutal and unprovoked aggression against China and occupation of French Indochina by a steadily rising program of economic sanctions including embargoes on oil and other military-related trade. The military-dominated Japanese government had already decided by mid-October 1941 to retaliate by attacking the United States unless the United States submitted to all Japanese demands - removal of all embargoes and a free hand to seize resource-rich countries across East and South-East Asia. The Japanese government knew that the Americans were highly unlikely to submit to Japan's demands. To distract the American government while it secretly positioned a powerful aircraft carrier strike force for a surprise attack on the United States Pacific Fleet at its Pearl Harbor base in Hawaii, the Japanese government ordered its envoys in Washington to engage the Americans in intensive diplomatic discussions related to American concerns about Japan's aggression against China and occupation of French Indo China.

When it comes to historical accuracy, I have a serious problem with the Japanese contribution to the film. The Japanese account contains two major falsifications of history that appear to be intended to mislead viewers by minimising Japan's and Hirohito's war guilt in relation to Pearl Harbor. With the apparent intention of disguising the treacherous nature of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in peacetime and at 8.00 am on a Sunday morning (Hawaii Time), the Japanese producers suggest that Japan intended to submit a 14-part document containing a formal declaration of war to the American Secretary of State, Mr Cordell Hull, at 1.00 pm on December 7 (Washington Time). At 1.00 pm in Washington it would be 7.30 am in Hawaii and half an hour before the Japanese planes were scheduled to strike Pearl Harbor. The film suggests that tendering of this formal ""declaration of war"" at 1.00 pm was frustrated by decoding and clerical delays in the Japanese embassy in Washington. Such delays may have occurred, but the Japanese document eventually submitted to Secretary of State Hull at 2.20 pm on December 7 (eighty minutes after the first Japanese bomb fell on Hawaii) was not a formal declaration of war. It was not even an ultimatum. It was merely a summary of Japanese grievances and demands, coupled with a blunt announcement that Japan was terminating the lengthy diplomatic negotiations between Ambassador Nomura and Secretary of State, Cordell Hull. On two occasions in the film, Admiral Yamamoto and his staff officers refer to the 14-part document as a ""declaration of war"" which it clearly was not. Japan formally declared war on the United States several hours after the last Japanese aircraft had returned to its carrier from the smoking ruins of the American battleship fleet at Pearl Harbor.

New evidence of the treacherous nature of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has been revealed by Professor Takeo Iguchi who has spent years combing Japan's foreign ministry archives. Professor Iguchi felt that the Japanese diplomats in Washington had been unfairly blamed for the late arrival on Cordell Hull's desk of the 14-part message breaking off peace talks. Professor Iguchi claims that foreign ministry records reveal that the foreign ministry wanted to tender an ultimatum to Cordell Hull before the Pearl Harbor attack but the Imperial Army insisted that the final message should simply terminate diplomatic negotiations to avoid alerting the United States to its danger. Iguchi claims that foreign ministry records show the military deliberately withheld the final part of the 14-part message to ensure that the translated document would not reach Secretary of State Hull until after Pearl Harbor had been attacked. Professor Iguchi has an interest to serve by clearing the Japanese diplomats of negligence. His father was one of them. But the truth of the claims by Professor Iguchi can be tested by reference to documents that he claims are in Japan's foreign ministry archives.

The Japanese contribution to Tora! Tora! Tora! also falsely represents Emperor Hirohito as a benign figurehead commander of Japan's military who approved the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor because he was powerless to stop it. In a conversation prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor between Prime Minister Konoye and Admiral Yamamoto, Konoye is heard to say: ""His Majesty's signature is a mere formality. The Cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy."" Both statements are untrue. Under the Meiji Constitution of 1889, Hirohito could have overridden his cabinet on any issue and refused to authorise the attack on Pearl Harbor had he wanted to do so. The only significant aspect of the added ten minutes for Japanese audiences is a conversation between Admiral Yamamoto and a senior palace official in the Imperial Palace. The palace official falsely represents Hirohito as having been opposed to war with the United States but powerless to stop it. A study of Japanese history, and especially the Meiji Constitution, will reveal that the Meiji Constitution vested full control of the Japanese armed forces in the emperor, and the chiefs of Japan's military reported directly to the emperor and not to the civilian government. The fact that Hirohito was a ""hands on"" commander in chief with his military attaches active on every Pacific War front and briefing him daily is confirmed by Japan's official history of the Pacific War ""Senshi Sosho"" and by historian Professor Herbert P. Bix in his authoritative Pulitzer Prize-winning biography ""Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan"" (2000), especially at pages 327, 329-331, 359, and 387-391.

I hope these historical falsifications contrived by the Japanese producers will not spoil anyone's enjoyment of a film that I still regard as a masterful account of an appalling act of treachery. I deny TTT five stars only because of the falsification of history in the Japanese contribution. I recommend avoiding the 148 minute Japanese release and watching the 138 minute version released originally for American audiences.",1323907200,195,9316,5.2476510067114095

270878,5,6300246876,"First, I want to comment on a few of the recent documentaries which were screened on pay TV, as part of the 70th annivesary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Most of these documentaires were woeful. They gave a poor impression of what actually happened, and the re-creation footage was washed-out and aenemic. They criticized Hollywood in general for their innacuracies, without being specific about the particular movies. Obviously they thought they could get away with it, given the generally woeful historicity of Hollywood. But if they were casting aspersion on TORA TORA TORA, they picked the wrong movie.

Another really irritating thing about these specials was the way in which they tried to create the impression that it was their recent research (the documentaries') that unearthed the facts  concerning the Japanese declaration of war arriving too late. Give me a break - these particular facts have been known for DECADES!

Anyway, to the movie. Of course, the directors were lucky - the real story of the Pearl Harbour attack itself had all the elements of a good drama plot - the crafty, stealthy enemy, the superpower caught napping, the late transmission of the war declaration, etc. But they built the tension and drama up extremely well, with the continual switching between Hawaii and the diplomat's offices in the States.

The Japanese - both the diplomats and the attack personel (pilots, naval officers, etc) - were believable and human; they were not portrayed as the evil machine-like enemy, but as sympathetic people (the Japanese war attrocities notwithstanding)

The attack scenes were extremely well-done; realistic, yet not overdone (as they tend to be today)

This videotape starts with a trailer that advertised this product. ""The most spectacular film ever made!"" The movie starts with a view of a Japanese aircraft carrier. Admiral Yamamoto is now in charge of this ship. [He opposed the politics of the Army.] The Army wants an alliance with Germany. The US opposes their war on China. The British, French, and Dutch removed soldiers from their colonial possessions and weakened their military forces in Asia. The US moved its fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. The Japanese diplomat brings a list of questions for the US government. The US government has a decoding machine to read the Japanese messages. The Japanese plan to destroy the US fleet for a quick victory. [No Plan B?] Commander Genda created a plan of attack. Their Type 21 Zero fighter is better than the Spitfire or Messerschmidt. The US Air Corps General doesn't want the airplanes spread out since that makes sabotage easier. Will the US Navy rotate its carriers so they're not all in port?

Combat aircraft are flying artillery that can attack at long range. ""Genda has thought of everything."" The US has also surmised their plan, will they guard against this? But they don't have the B-17s needed for long-range observation. The new radar can check for airplanes. Yamamoto says a victory in the Pacific will not end the war. The President is removed from the Ultra list! The US military is warned to take ""precautionary measures"". General Short orders a ""Full Alert"". Grouping aircraft makes them vulnerable to an attack. Japanese airplanes practice their tactics against an island. The US radar station is now located on a mountain top, but has no telephone line. The Japanese send a new Ambassador to the US; he signed the Pact with Germany. Colonel Bratton surmises a significance in a specific date. A British report tells of Japanese transports off of Formosa. He predicts an attack on Sunday, November 30 from these undeniable facts. ""The US desires Japanesean to commit the first overt act."" But keep on the alert. Navy fighters are sent to Midway and Wake. Airplanes will patrol the search from carriers. The Japanese Embassy in Washington will get a 14-part message. [The Japanese attack fleet approached from the North outside of the usual shipping lanes.] The decoded 13-part message is given to the White House Sat. evening when people are busy.

Boeing B-17s are expected to arrive at 7:30 am on Sunday. The Japanese reply must be given to America at 1pm Washington time. The Japanese coding machines, cipher books, and secret papers must be destroyed immediately! Sunday is a day of rest, everything is closed down. The Japanese aircraft take off in the dark. General Marshall orders an alert to the Pacific commands. A Navy destroyer sees a submarine trying to sneak into Pearl Harbor and attacks it. Will all commanders be warned? The Honolulu radio is a beacon. The Army radar station gets a warning. ""Don't worry about it."" The warning from Washington is sent by commercial telegram. The Japanese aircraft sight their targets, who are unprepared for defense at 8am. ""This is no drill!"" The US aircraft grouped together are a target. That flight of B-17s scatters to other airfields. Japanese airplanes drop bombs and torpedoes. The USS Arizona and other warships suffer serious damage.

""Its Pearl"" says the Secretary of War; it is confirmed. P-40s take off from other fields to attack the enemy. One ship is beached to prevent blocking of the south channel. More US aircraft are attacked on the ground. One damaged Japanese airplane crashes into a hangar. The Japanese diplomats deliver their message after the attack. The Japanese Navy does not launch a second wave; the US carriers were out to sea and pose a threat. The Japanese Navy has a limited fuel supply. Mission accomplished. Would the sneak attack infuriate America? [Was the Washington meeting deliberately delayed?]

The Japanese also attacked the Dutch East Indies (oil), British Singapore, French Indo-China, and the Philippines. The success of the Japanese inspired both resistance to them, and later wars of national liberation in Indo-China, Indonesia and the Philippines. In 1926 E. Philip Oppenheim wrote a novel of intrigue where the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, while Germany and Russia attacked the east coast of America.

270886,5,6300246876,"I first saw Tora Tora Tora at the Pantages in Hollywood in 1970 when I was 14. It blew me away then, and it blows me away today. This is Fox producer Darryl Zanuck's purest vision, and brought his career to a glorious close.

To start with, this is the greatest collection of male character actors that Hollywood ever assembled, American OR Japanese. From Edward Andrews to Martin Balsam, EG Marshall to Wesley Addy, the cast is beyond the expectations any of us have a right to have, and that's just the American side of the cast.

The parallel editing between the Japanese and American sides of the story is innovative and marvelously effective - two movies cut side by side, until the attack, when it all comes together in the most amazing battle scene ever filmed. NO computers were used in the making of the special effects, and the full scale destruction is astonishing. The miniatures show 20th Century Fox effects team in top form. What an admirable visual and dramatic achievement, all the more so because the film prides itself on it's historical accuracy. Fox spent nearly 25 million+ in 1970, which was an astronomical budget at the time for a film with no major stars, and dangerously risky. But you can see every dollar right up there on the screen.

Not only on the American side, but on the Japanese side as well, the action, the editing, and that bone-crunching soundtrack pull together one of Hollywood's most underrated achievements of the 60's and 70's. This is the rare Hollywood masterpiece that is about acting portrayals, NOT movie stars. T-T-T is among Jerry Goldsmith's very best scores, full of orchestral color.

The film's only misfortune is that it was released in the middle of an anti-Vietnam-war fervor, and thus did not garner widespread favor with the public. It is as if T-T-T and Patton -- two epic WW2 blockbusters -- were released in 1970 by the studio executives to counteract the anti-war movement. It wouldn't surprise me.

This movie was meant to be seen wide screen. The commentary track by directory Richard Fleischer is fascinating, though slow and measured. Fleischer's right -- to see this in 4x3 pan and scan should be made a felony. An incredible piece of history told in a non-propagandistic fashion (oh, hell, how do I know?). The whole fox studio stretched every muscle and flexed every tendon to make this one. WOW! T-T-T will continue to enthrall future generations with it's stunning authenticity and visceral impact.

It does not rely on a love story or other corny subplot to fill in screen time.

This certain element did deeply hurt one film A Bridge Too Far for having too many well-known stars which proved to be a major distraction for me. In Tora! Tora! Tora!, it is very easy for me to focus on the film for its story rather than the stars. So, a giant round of kudos to everybody who decided on this approach. Meanwhile, I like how the directors of the film opted for subtitles of characters as they are introduced, but I got disappointed when he stopped doing that after twenty minutes, only to sparingly use the technique. For so many years, I never knew what the word ""Tora"" meant, and now...in two-syllabic combination, it means ""Attack"" for ""To"" and ""Torpedo attack"" for ""Ra."" Also, it means ""Tiger."" Much of what I read about the Pearl Harbor attack seems to be reflected the same in Tora! Tora! Tora!, and I do remember that famous line from Admiral Yamamoto when he says, ""I fear all we have done is to awaken the sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."" This line is probably entirely false but still memorable. Watching how the U.S. military have goofed their jobs up, I find it amazing that the taxpayers had to pay so much money to them in return for proper defenses of this country. As for the direction of Tora! Tora! Tora!, I find it interesting that the film is done in parallelism: Japanese and American units. Yet there is a distinct difference of the energy level on both sides. Granted, Richard Fleischer is a notoriously tedious director who often has failed to generate any excitement in his films. The aerial scenes of the Japanese fighters in Tora! Tora! Tora! are stunning, and the displays of the American ships are really neat. The cameramen does a great job of capturing them all without losing focus. For a brief time, the lens of the camera is dirty. I don't see much of the gunshot wounds inflicted on the American soldiers, so...a bit of disappointment there. All in all, although I read that many critics found the film boring, I felt that Tora! Tora! Tora! is an extremely fair film that accurately told the story well and as how it happened just like how Thirteen Days retold the story. It may also be fair to say that Tora! Tora! Tora! could be the one of the fewest unHollywood picture that doesn't glorify the common elements that Pearl Harbor had abused to extensive lengths. Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of the really good war pictures to see because it feels very straight forward with no reliance of ballyhooed Hollywood elements which have hijacked the purpose of the film.

5/11: Raising my rating of Tora! Tora! Tora! from `6' to `9', I still find the special effects to be particularly outstanding in a complete absence of CGI. The low-key level of casting makes the film a standard of not only World War II but any war picture. It is exactly the reason why Tora! Tora! Tora! doesn't become distracted by having hordes of big stars making their five minute cameos that add nothing of value to the overall story. Rather, the film allows the story to evolve step by step in terms of what really happened in Pearl Harbor. It is a great piece of cinema, and of course, the special effects steals the show, especially in the last half hour. Another winning feature of the film which raises the standard of war, and anything else, pictures is the idea of Japanese players to speak their own native tongue. All in all, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great war picture that deserves to be seen and admired for its simplicity.",1307145600,2,4400,4.603821656050956

This earlier movie depicts political and military events and decisions leading up to the attack by naval units of the Empire of Japan on the US Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor, HI.  I like the use of the Japanese language with subtitles for the Japanese characters...it added a sense of realism not obtainable another way.

The behind the scenes view of this film, including the goings-on inside the Japanese embassy in Washington D.C., the US military's ability to read Japan's diplomatic code, and the clues it gave all contribute to the realism.  The tension is almost palpable as coded messages come in and are broken, and middle-level military personnel try to get high ranking leaders to act.

At the same time, the discord between the Japanese naval and army leaders provides insight into the fact that there was not unanimity on the decision to go to war, but a reluctant acceptance that an attack was unavoidable...so it was planned and carried out, extremely well.

The special effects are somewhat dated, but this is a film that military history buffs will appreciate.

The unbiased narrative and historical value is good enough and we finally get to see a why Japan had a logical reason to attack and to do it when they did.

If you're looking for insane action, ultra cool effects, and hollywood flare, then watch the newer Pearl Harbor with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnet. That movie rocked as an entertainment piece, but if you're looking for a less biased view of the events that enfolded in on Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora is the movie to watch.

271017,5,6300246876,"This movie is now nearly forty years old, but it remains the standard for depicting Japan's attack on the United States fleet based in Pearl Harbor.  Unlike other films, Tora, Tora, Tora sticks to its main point throughout its run time.  The film is critical of the United States' commanders who disregarded evident warning signs of the impending attack and shows also how difficult is was for brass in Washington, thousands of miles away, to relay their concerns to the fleet in Hawaii.

Honolulu in 1941 was a sleepy outpost and not the modern tourist center it is today.  As a result, the military base was the biggest show in town.  This was America's most important base in the Pacific, but too many people failed to prvide it the security needed for such an imporant base.  Japan was able to position its fleet within striking distance without detection as no American naval patrols were assigned to circle the islands looking for potential threats.  Radar operators picked up the attacking planes but their warnings were ignored by their superiors.

Tora, Tora, Tora admits the flaws not only in the American defenses, but also in the flaws of Japan's attack plans.  Though the attack on Pearl harbor was more or less a ""surprise,"" it did not achieve the immobilization of the American aircraft carriers.  It also did not deliver the knockout blow Japan anticipated.  Isolationists in America, including many congressmen, would not allow the country to fully prepare for war and Japan banked on this anti0war sentiment to carry the day for their plans.  Unfortunately for Japan, they did awaken the sleeping giant that Admiral Yamamoto pondered at the film's end.

This film is well directed and has an allstar cast.  The attack scenes are very well done and even the more recent film ""Pearl Harbor"" cannot really do more to show the destruction of much of the fleet within the harbor.  The acting is done well by all the characters and the film moves at a pace that is both informative and to the point.  It will take quite an effort to knock this movie off of its lead rank as the definitive Hollywood depiction of the attack of December 7, 1941.",1255478400,2,2155,4.768194070080862
271018,5,6300246876,"When the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill broke open a bottle of champagne and asked the men with him to toast with him to victory.  His men were stunned and thought he was crazy.  Finally, one of them asked him why.

Churchill responded, ""America is like a giant boiler. Light a fire under it, and there is no limit to the amount of heat that it can generate.""

Of course, every boiler needs to be lighted, and December 7, 1941, the ""Day that would live in infamy"" would be the event that would nudge neutral America into World War II.

There have been several films made about the attack on Pearl Harbor, but to my mind, none parallel the authenticity of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""  Perhaps one of the biggest reasons why it was such a successful, and for the most part, historically accurate film, is because the film was a collaboration of American and Japanese film-makers. In short, you got the perspective and events from BOTH sides.  This has rarely happened in film, and it is what makes ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" stand apart from all the rest.

It seems that war is inevitable, and the United States have invoked an embargo against Japan for actions taken in China.  This becomes a critical issue for Japan, since they desperately need these resources to keep their war effort going.  While the United States is attempting to resolve the matter peacefully, it becomes apparent to Japan that war is inevitable; and perhaps even to members of the intelligence community in the U.S., war is becoming more and more evident for America too.

Japan realizes that their only chance to defeat the United States is to first wipe out the American Pacific Fleet, which has since been moved from San Diego to Honolulu, Hawaii.  Therefore, and elaborate plan is called for, and Japan calls upon one of their master strategists to plan for such an attack.  Everything is carefully calculated down to the last detail.  It's actually very intriguing to see how the plan was devised from the Japanese perspective.

Meanwhile, the Americans are more concerned about sabotage from local Japanese than they are about an actual attack.  Therefore, the airfields have moved their planes closer together, to make it more difficult for a saboteur to attack.  However, the U.S. intelligence community is gathering evidence that suggests that Japan is going to attack.  Ironically, Lt. Colonel Bratton is initially off by one week.  There are so many instances and evidence to suggest that the U.S. had ample evidence to presume that there would be an attack, and yet so many precautions were never implemented.  In short, Japan would catch the U.S. with their pants down.

The film has a top-rate cast on both sides, from Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel to Jason Robards as General Short, and So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto to Takahiro Tamura as flight Commander, Fuchida who leads the air strike.  Yamamoto is a man who studied in the U.S. and desperately asks his men not to underestimate the Americans.  He predicts that they can fight the United States for about a year.  Yamamoto understood that when Americans come together, there is nothing to stop them (thus, the giant boiler!).

The film expertly moves back and forth between the Americans and the Japanese.  It's like watching a chess match, and seeing each side make their moves which finally lead up to the conclusion of the Japanese surprise attack.

Many veterans of the the attack from both sides were consulted to try and make the film as accurate as possible.

The only viable success that America could claim from the attack was that none of their aircraft carriers were present.  Yamamoto already understood that victory in naval battles was nearly entirely dependent upon the airplane.  Battleship battles were a thing of the past, and you can see his disappointment in hearing that, although they wreaked extensive damage, the primary targets were not there, which leads him to utter his famous words of, ""I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant, and fill him with a terrible resolve.""

If you truly want to bask in the historical accuracy of a film about Pearl Harbor, you can't do any better then ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""  At nearly 3 hours, the film leaves nothing out.  There isn't a single scene that does not belong, and even though we already know what is going to happen, and what the conclusion will be, the film keeps the suspense and intrigue building and building right up to the attack.  Now, that's brilliant film-making!",1254960000,2,4539,4.806701030927835
271019,5,6300246876,"This is an absolutely fascinating historical journey told with great accuracy and nuance.  It examines how all the intricate parts interacted to create first the debacle that was the Pearl Harbor attack to the coming war that utterly ruined Japan for a generation.  In a deeper sense, the story is about the collision of two cultures that couldn't be more different, with catastrophic results.

The sophistication of the presentation is truly wonderful, with psychological nuance in the doubts and bravado of Japanese power brokers and a comedy of errors on the American side.  The portraits of the Japanese leaders are balanced, ignoring no complexity and studying their characters.  The army has more of less taken control, pushing their diplomats into an ill-considered alliance with fascist Germany, which came to distort the image of a militarist/nationalist Japan into something much worse (and inaccurate).  The emperor's family is weak, fantasy prone, and complicit, while the rank and file are convinced that their fighting spirit makes them superior to decadent Americans. Fascinatingly, it is the commanding admiral who wants to avoid the army-led war, though he dutifully prepares a daring attack on the US navy's principal base in the Pacific, PH.

On the American side, there are many complacent skeptics, but others who appear nearly prescient in their fears.  Many small decisions are made - to place fighter aircraft in the center of the airfield to protect them from sabotage, but rendering them vulnerable to air attack - that add up to a total lack of preparedness.  Some flacks even picked up the Japanese attack squadron on radar, which their immediate superiors blithely chose to ignore.  Many US leaders sensed something was coming, but could not effectively mount a lasting defense.

The film ends ominously for the Japanese.  While claiming a decisive tactical victory, a diplomatic flub up (a slow typist delayed the declaration of war until 1 hour after the attack) threatened to ""awaken the giant"" of American military might with righteous rage.  The result was a gigantic war of attrition, which the Americans were bound to win.

I remember seeing this as a child, expecting a war film and getting diplomacy for the first 2 hours instead.  The end battle is spectacular, but for a kid was too long in coming.  As an adult steeped in history, it is the greatest feast of detail.  That makes this, for the time, a daring accomplishment, when what sold was John Wayne mythology rather than accurate history.

271021,5,6300246876,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is epic filmmaking at its best: a film that realistically depicts the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1971, a generation's defining moment that launched America into the conflict known as World War II.

Winner of  a well-deserved Oscar for special effects, the film's production qualities are still impressive after all these years.  There's no CGI here, just the carefully choreographed battle sequences, with REAL plans flying and exploding and intricately-designed models, portraying the battleships that were attacked by Japanese pilots.

The cast of Japanese and America character actors do a remarkable job of portraying a somewhat balanced look at both sides.  Kudos go out especially to veteran George Macready as Cordell Hull, Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel, Wesley Addy as the determined Lt. Commander Kramer, So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto, James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, Shogo Shimada as Ambassador Nomura, and Jason Robards, Jr. as General Short.

Neville Brand, himself a highly-decorated WWII veteran in real life, gets to deliver one of the film's most memorable lines.  In one brief sequence, the film also pays tribute to Dorie Miller, a black soldier who managed to fired heavily artillery at several of the attacking plans, even though he had no formal training in the gun's operation.

Jerry Goldsmith's score is appropriately subtle and dynamic.  Surprisingly, and wisely, the producers and the director chose to present the attack itself sans music.

The three documentaries included in the set are totally engaging, providing background on the making of the film as well as the historical date itself, respectively.  Also, Richard Fleischer's commentary is fascinating as he details the creation and filming of the 1970 film.

""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is not just a testament to fallen soldiers and the attack of sixty-eight years ago but to Hollywood's attention to detail in telling a historical event.",1251072000,,1955,5.352941176470588

Being historically accurate, it is an excellent way to learn about the beginnings of WWII from the perspective of either Japan or the U.S., without any bias. It has important relevance to the world situation toady because it was a war over resources, mainly oil and rubber, which Japan vitally needed for their booming industry. (Japan became a great industrial power while the rest of the world was mired in the Great Depression). The film gives good coverage to the U.S. embargo against Japan, [which was in response to Japanese aggression in Malaya, China, the Dutch East Indies and French Indo-China] and to the Japanese diplomatic efforts in trying to avoid the [increasingly restrictive list of items added to the] embargo.

Despite providing many political and strategic details, this movie is filled with action and suspense.  The special effects are excellent and add to the realism without being surreal.

The Japanese actors were filmed in Japan, speaking Japanese with English subtitles. The Japanese actors' performance was excellent and the film was very popular in Japan.

The story, by most accounts almost documentary like, is very accurate in depicting the mistakes made by the U.S. military in being caught off guard but it could have been much worse had any of the aircraft carriers been in port which were the real Japanese targets, knowing they had to try to defuse America's air superiority in the Pacific. In the end the Japanese realize they may have won the battle but 'they had awakened a sleeping giant' which they will now have to deal with.

This movie is outstanding... just superb. You won't find better action footage in any WW II film and there's plenty of it too! We (Americans) clearly got our behinds tromped during the Pearl Harbor invasion but, because this is an American film, that facet of actuality is slightly played down, (micro victories by individuals are featured to counter our overall demise), as is Roosevelt's alleged desire to enter the war minimized, (my 90 year-old aunt asserts that FDR was Satan himself, I think mostly due to how our family members, during the conflict, were fruitlessly lost and suffered as POWs).

In any event, the scenes herein shift between Washington D.C. political activities and those of the Pearl Harbor principals. Of course, the Japanese planning and action sequences are similarly featured.

The film is shot in letterbox and runs 144 minutes in length. Excellent color saturation, with great casting (bulging with big period stars), top scenery, believeable script, 70 mm cinematography, and awesome sets all contribute to the aggregate success of this exceptional film. It's all very realistic and not hokey in any sense. A lot of the footage, where the Japanese are speaking, is subtitled in English but it's well-done and not at all distracting. Compare it to the German subtitles in ""The Longest Day"".

I can't convey enough good comments about this movie. If you are even just a casual movie viewer of common genres, you'll probably much enjoy this well-made historical film, albeit some dramatic artistic license was tastefully invoked by the directors, Richard Fleischer, Kinji Fukasaku, and Toshio Masuda .

I do recommend that you have the movie ""Midway,"" (a sort of historic Act II), ready at hand to watch following ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" the former of which is a similarly fine film.",1203897600,3,1921,5.0664556962025316

271109,5,6300246876,"This film is fairly accurate and mostly without political spin ( by nature, all historical works have some spin ). It allows the historical facts re-tell the story.

Indeed, I would love to see more WWII ( and yes, maybe some WWI or older ) battles told in this fashion. The movie Midway started down this path, but drifted very far in its attempt.

271110,5,6300246876,"20th Century Fox's genuinely spectacular account of the attack on Pearl Harbor told from both the American and Japanese viewpoints was in real terms an even bigger financial disaster for the studio than Cleopatra: even by latter-period roadshow standards, reminding American audiences of the incredible catalogue of blunders and incompetence that led to the Day of Infamy at a time when they were in the midst of another war in Asia (and one that was not going well) seems like business decision making at its most kamikaze. The film has probably made more money out of being carved up for stock footage than it ever did in the cinema, featuring prominently in Midway, Pearl and both The Winds of War and War and Remembrance among others.

Like Cleopatra, it was a troubled production: Akira Kurosawa worked on the Japanese side of the film for months but delivered only one brief scene in the finished film before being replaced by two more special effects friendly directors (Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku) while on the American side Richard Fleischer relied on Ray Kellog and Robert Enrietto to shoot much of the spectacular finale.

From the last days when films were consciously visually designed for the Scope screen, it is mounted on a scale that would be inconceivable today - what Pearl Harbor did with CGi it did with real ships and aircraft - with a tight, focused script that dispenses with fictional sub-plots (no Ben Affleck winning the Battle of Britain single-handed here) in favour of absolute historical accuracy. Seen entirely from the military and political mindset, it has the edge on most cinematic exercises in battlefield history through the conviction of its direction, particularly the visually impressive Japanese sequences, and of its playing. With the exception of Soh Yamamura and E.G. Marshall, most of the top-liners are barely in the film, but the large ensemble cast copes surprisingly well with the task of having to embody attitudes and impart information rather than working on clearly defined characters, adding the colour as they find it in the gaps. Perhaps most surprising is the incredible degree of tension the film manages to achieve in the run-up to the attack despite the inevitability of the outcome. When it finally comes, the special effects are among the best ever seen on the screen. Jerry Goldsmith's score is also a major plus, relentlessly building menace and tension as the film races toward the inevitable.

While the previous DVD issue was pretty threadbare, the two-disc edition has a number of features covering both the making of the film and the real attack itself.",1196380800,4,2629,5.025229357798165
271111,5,6300246876,"I have seen the TV miniseries ""Pearl"" and the disastrous ""Pearl Harbor"" and I still say ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" is the finest telling of the story of Pearl Harbor I have ever seen.  The battle sequences were state-of-the-art for it's day, and even the model work is superb. There is very little of the hammy drama that the other versions had, and more of the straight truth that was the disaster and tragedy of the Day of Infamy.  What makes it so special is that it viewed the battle from both sides, with American and Japanese directors.  I can't say I forgive the Japanese for the attack, but as a result of the film, I came to understand more of the reasons the attack happened.  The film shows that mistakes made by the American commanders were compounded by the fact that the United States was just not ready for war.  Unfortuantely, both General Short (Jason Robards) and Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam)were made into scapegoats for our lack of preparedness, but each in his way tried to prevent the attack with what resources and knowledge they had, but it just wasn't enough. The individual heroism of both the Americans and the Japanese as soldiers reflected honor on the part of both adversaries.  Even Yamamoto argued against the attack, but when he was overruled, he did his duty.  And while Japanese naval officers celebrated their success, Yamamoto said ""I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill it with a terrible resolve.""

By the way, USAF General Ken Taylor, one of the two young Army Air Corps pilots who got off the ground in a P-40 Warhawk that day visited the set while it was being made and undoubtedly contributed his expertise.

The movie correctly shows the surprise attack in terms of American naivete' and leadership blunders rather than as a conspiracy by the Roosevelt administration to get America into the war. This probably bugs conspiracy theorists, but thats fine by me...

There was very good attention to detail in many aspects of the movie. The Zeros are believable, and the scene where they take off at dawn is wonderful, right down to the sunrise and the smoke pot at the end of the carrier deck. I also noticed at the scene early on where Yamamoto boards the ship, there is a detachment of Japanese ""marines"" as honor guard, in slightly different uniforms from the Navy men, as they would indeed have been. Don't know if it actually happened that way, but the effect is believable.
Theres a couple of scenes where the torpedo bombers (Jap) in the distance have a pilot but the other 2 crewmen appear to be missing - but you have to look to notice. There is also the scene where LT Kaminsky reports the submarine contact to his superior who is shaving at home. He wipes away the shaving cream to answer the phone and he's already smooth-shaven! Ah, well:)...

The effects are EXCELLENT, esp. considering this was a 1970 film....
Army Air Corps aviators Taylor and Welch were portrayed, but were a bit goofy acting. Maybe thats to be expected, as young military pilots are won't to be!
The scene where the band starts playing right as the attack commences is almost funny - the conductor has them playing fast halfway through it as though he wants to finish before they bolt away...kinda humorous:)

This is so much better than the movie ""Midway"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" with their romances and dramas, theres really no comparison. Those two were terrible in comparison. Midway especially had a lot of over-acting.

The Japanese actors playing Yamamoto and Nagumo were especially credible. So were Bratton and Kramer. The true inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy intelligence and de-coding teams was not heavily emphasized, but it does not take away from the movie.

271167,5,6300246876,"This is the definitive Pearl Harbor movie. It often is unfairly compared  to 2001's ""Pearl Harbor,"" but in truth the two are almost in separate genres. Unlike the latter movie, which was basically ""Titanic"" with the Japanese attack thrown in the middle, this one was very thoroughly researched and carefully written to be as true to history as possible. It is probably as accurate as a film about the Pearl Harbor attack and the events leading up to it will ever be. However, the people who will truly enjoy this film are not the Sunday matinee crowd, but rather history enthusiasts, war movie buffs, and those who are eager to learn about the attack and don't mind sitting through a rather long movie that's not particularly exciting (unless you're enthralled by diplomats talking and admirals planning) except during its final minutes.

Approaching its 40th anniversary, this movie is from another era; it was made at a time when good performances, historical accuracy, and attention to detail were more important than fast pacing, superstar cast members, and spectacular effects (though the effects in this film were top-notch for the time, and still hold up). There are no big-name actors in it, even at the time it was made. There are no soap-opera love triangles, pointless action sequences, or unnecessary dramatic moments. There's no filler, here, folks. Tora! Tora! Tora! moves along at a deliberate--though not slow--pace, and each aspect of the history leading up to the attack is covered such that a viewer who is paying attention should have no trouble knowing what is going on and who the key players are. The caveat is that, unless you are familiar with the related history, you HAVE to pay attention, or you will miss important plot points.

Those who have an interest in war history, especially WWII history, should thoroughly enjoy it; however, it provides no gimmicks to make it more accessible to those with a merely passing interest in the film's subject matter. This is no summer blockbuster popcorn flick. It's a serious look at the motives behind the attack, and a thoughtful analysis of what allowed the attack to succeed. If you want lots of big explosions and Hollywood drama, you might be better off sticking to the 2001 film. For history buffs, though, this is the only way to go.",1180310400,7,2309,4.900255754475704
271168,5,6300246876,"The first time I saw Tora! Tora! Tora! was on the big screen at Naval Hospital, San Diego.  I liked it so much I saw it three nights in a row.  Some years later, I purchased the VHS video tape the day of its release.  I have two DVD versions of Tora! Tora! Tora! as well as two VHS versions of the movie.  I've also watched the Japanese version (with English subtitles).  Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great film but it should not be taken as the ultimate ""truth"" about Pearl Harbor and how America got into World War II.

Tora! Tora! Tora! used an American director for the American sequences, and two Japanese directors (the first was fired) for the filming of the Japanese sequences.  Much of the original Japanese crew was let go when the first Japanese director was fired (for being way over budget and for producing only 600 feet of film, as I recall).

This is a truly excellent movie that men and women can both watch and enjoy.

Beware, however, the scenes showing the ""12 Apositles"" who were ""allowed access"" to `Magic'(decrypted Japanese diplomatic and consular intercepts).  The actual number of Americans with access to Magic was well over 100.  And the President's name was NEVER taken off what the movie calls ""the Ultra List.""  (FDR didn't actually read all the daily diplomatic intercepts, of which the Army and Navy had just over 8,000 in 1941 alone.  Instead, he read daily summaries of the intercepts.  The same applies to most of the senior officers in the War and Navy Departments.)

Alwin D. Kramer, Lieutenant Commander, U.S. Navy, and Colonel Rufus Sumnter Bratton, U.S. Army, both worked in different offices rather than in a combined Army-Navy office shown in the movie.  Both men were attached to the Far Eastern Sections of their respective intelligence departments (Office of Naval Intelligence with Kramer; Military Intelligence Division (for Bratton).)  Bratton was officer in charge of the Far Eastern Section of MID.  Kramer was head of OP-20-GZ (translation section in the Office of Naval Communications, OP-20), but he was actually on OP-16's (Office of Naval Intelligence's) payroll.  Tora! Tora! Tora! gives Bratton's middle initial as ""G"", but that is in error.  His middle name was Sumnter, as stated above.

""Magic"" (again, intercepted foreign diplomatic and consular messages) was critical to what the U.S. (and British) Governments knew of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's diplomatic efforts.  Although the National Security Agency still denies this, we also had a product called Ultra as relates to Japan.  These were intercepted, decoded and translated Japanese naval and military intercepts.  Ultra played a major part in our victory over the Combined Fleet in the Battle of Midway, fought 4 to 6 June 1942.

Tora! Tora! Tora! is, as I said, an excellent movie.  It's full of suspense and it is very well acted by both the Americans and the Japanese.  It presents a fair few of both the American and Japanese perspectives that helped lead to ""Pearl Harbor"" and U.S. entry into the Second World War.

First Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler is claimed in the movie to say, ""Well, don't worry about it,"" when he's told of the large number of planes approaching the Opana Point Radar station from north of Oahu (flying in over Kahuku Point).  Tyler himself later testified that this was his reaction to the radar report phoned to him by Privates Lockard and Elliott.  Here's the rub: The USS LEXINGTON had a radar and visual sighting of two Japanese carrier aircraft approximately 400 miles north west of Oahu on Saturday afternoon, 6 December 1941.  LEXINGTON's radar report was the real first sighting of some of the Japanese aircraft that took part in the raid on Pearl Harbor.

American intelligence didn't ""fail"" in the lead up to the events of 7 December 1941.  Intelligence, however, isn't always used the way the average citizen thinks it should be used.  Those in high political and military offices have many strategic and tactical matters they have to factor into the decision making process.  Not the least of these was the apathy of the American people in the period leading up to the Japanese raid on our obsolete battleships at Pearl Harbor.  (Our three carriers then in the Pacific, LEXINGTON, ENTERPRISE and SARATOGA were not in port on 7 Dec. 1941.  ""Target ship,"" USS UTAH, was moored at a carrier berth off Ford Island.  Battleship COLORADO, that had completed an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington a month before, was still at Bremerton.  WEST VIRGINIA, that was overdue for overhaul, was moored outboard at Ford Island.)

This reviewer spent a little over 13 years researching Pearl Harbor on a full time basis.  He has absolutely no animus for the Japanese---nor does he hold any animus for any of the senior Americans involved with Pearl Harbor.

""Pearl Harbor"" saved the world (including Japan, in my opinion) from the Nazis.  At the cost of a few thousand Americans, millions of lives were spared in Europe and Asia---and, ultimately---in the U.S. as well.

Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of my ten favorite movies.  I've probably watched it over 50 times in the past thirty six years or so.  And I will probably watch it another fifty times or more between now and the time I storm the great beyond.

E.G. Marshall (R.S. Bratton) and Wesley Addy (A.D. Kramer) in the film both do exceptional jobs with their acting.  So does every other member of the U.S. and Japanese cast, in my opinion.

Great movie---and, in my opinion, a ""Must have"" for every American and Japanese who appreciates the very best in direction, acting, scenery, editing, cinamatography, etc.  This is also a good action film---and it is fair to both the Japanese and American perspectives.

A ""Well done!"" to every member of the cast and crew of Tora! Tora! Tora! and to 20th Century Fox for producing this wonderful movie!

The movie traces the tale of Dec 7, 1941 from both the American and Japanese perspective, which makes it different than most war movies (except for The Longest Day). This approach adds a lot of detail, and the story becomes the main focus of the film, not the actors.

Although the movie is a little long, the last 30 minutes of battle scenes makes up for the slow build up. Also, the movie does an excellent job showing how this tragedy unfolded, and all the mistakes made along the way.

271170,5,6300246876,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a really fine flick that still holds up well decades after its release. It tells its story in fine detail and with little or no mythologizing. It also has a much slower build up than most movies today. That suits the subject fine, but war movie-makers today seem to think their audiences need a whiz-bang beginning or they'll lose interest.

""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" seems mostly aimed at American audiences, but it was a joint American and Japanese production.  One of its strengths is that it goes much further to humanize the Japanese than the more typical US WWII war-film-as-propaganda of its day and earlier, especially in the character of Japanese naval commander in chief, Isoroku Yamamoto. (Clint Eastwood goes further still in ""Letters From Iwo Jima."") Still, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" portrays Yamamoto to flatter American audiences, showing him as holding grave doubts about the wisdom of going to war against the US. But other Japanese also are shown as individuals and not caricatures. We understand their motivations and can sympathize with them, even as Americans on the other side of the conflict. It ends with Yamamoto's (presumably fictional) words (here in paraphrase), ""We have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.""",1170720000,2,1277,5.105263157894737

One reviewer pointed out that there is about five minutes missing from the earlier DVD version and this new 2-disk version. I have compared the new version against my old (but excellent) VHS widescreen version dating from several years ago. I cannot find that anything is missing from the new 2-disk version. The only thing I can think of is that the ""intermission"" period in the new DVD version may have been shortened. Intermissions were not uncommon in ""blockbuster"" movies of the 1950's, 60's, and very early 70's. They varied in length. I timed the intermission in this new DVD version at ~3 minutes, which would have been short by the standards of the day.

I have read a number of books about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, including the best of all, ""Infamy"", by John Toland. The movie and that book are very closely in alignment.

The tight direction, despite several wordy interludes, propels the viewer up to the actual attack which culminates about 2/3rd's the way through. Understated acting by veteran TV actors Martin Balsam, EG Marshall and Jason Robards, in conjunction with a large Asian cast, keeps the story and plot on track to build momentum and drive the movie to its inevitable conclusion. Director Richard Fleischer effectively divides the story and allows the viewer to observe the planning and failures of both sides, making it a more complete depiction of what truly happened on that day.

Well worth multiple viewings and stands with Patton, Saving Private Ryan and Battle of Britain as some of the finest WW2 films ever made. Though for all it's cinematic greatness, it still flopped at the box office when released in September 1970. The reviews at the time intimated that the actual events the film was based on, were simply too depressing to enjoy. And no amount of acting or cinematography could compel ticket buyers to plunk down good money to see a movie with such a predictably, horrendous downer of an ending. Perhaps the addition of a major leading star could have excited the movie going public enough to look past the bleak storyline. Sadly, that mentality is indicative of the values of the American moviegoer.

Plays infinitely better though than the absolutely awful 2001 Micheal Bay directed Ben Affleck vehicle which only elicits snickers and chuckles at the absurd acting and preposterous plotline. I won't go into detail on that one, as there does not exist words that can aptly describe the sheer embarrassment of that ""bomb"".

271245,5,6300246876,"This review is dedicated to the memory
of S1c Robert E. Clarke, from my home town
of Great Bend, Kansas, who was among the men lost
aboard the USS ARIZONA on December 7th, 1941.

I had originally requested a DVD of 2001's ""Pearl Harbor"" for Christmas this year, but I had a change of heart and requested - and was given - ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" instead.

I served in the Navy as a Yeoman at COMSUBPAC Staff on the Pearl Harbor SUBASE in the early 1970s, and had made numerous visits to the USS ARIZONA Memorial during my two-year tour there. I looked down into the water and saw the outline of a once-powerful and proud United States warship. I touched the rusted stump of the ARIZONA's mainmast, to which is welded the flagpole from which the flag is flown every day over the USS ARIZONA Memorial. I read Walter Lord's book ""Day Of Infamy"" and made myself very familiar with the types and vintages of ships that were in the harbor on December 7th, 1941, and where they were located when the attack took place.

In later years I finally saw ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" on TV, and in 2001, when I saw the film ""Thirteen Days"" in the theaters, it was preceded by the trailer for the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" - all of which prophetically preceded our generation's own Pearl Harbor on 9-11.

""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" stays brilliantly on-topic, as any film about the attack on Pearl Harbor should do, and it goes to great length to stay true to what really happened on the Day That Will Live In Infamy.

Unlike the 2001 film, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" stayed true to the vintage of ships in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the actual relative locations of those ships in harbor on the day of the attack. There were a couple of glimpses of 1970s frigates in a couple of background shots in ""Tora"", but these views were forgivably brief, unlike the attempt by the latter film to openly pass 1970s-vintage Navy ships off as pre-World War II warships.  Maybe it is because I served in the Navy when those Knox-Class frigates were in service, but the ""Continuity break"" of ""Pearl Harbor"" passing them off as Pre-World-War-Two ships just jumped off the screen at me when I watched the 2001 film.

And the famous sortie of the USS NEVADA in her heroic dash towards the open sea, as the one and only battleship to get under way during the attack, was well captured with full accuracy in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" while being completely ignored in the latter film.

To most men in the harbor on December 7th, 1941, the NEVADA's bold drive down the harbor, with the American flag proudly waving from her fantail, was the finest thing they saw that day. One man who saw this remembered that the ""Star- Spangled Banner"" was written under identical circumstances during the overnight bombarding of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812, and he understood better the words of Francis Scott Key.

While Japanese Admiral Yamamoto probably never really uttered that line ""I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant, and fill him with a terrible resolve"", that line does capture Yamamoto's awareness that the United States was NOT a nation to be attacked without consequences. He knew full well the meaning of ""Don't Tread On Me!""

While it covers in detail the multiplicity of errors and blunders in the months, weeks, days, and even hours and minutes leading up to the attack, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" also takes you inside the mind of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, who planned the attack, but, having been in the United States, knew of America's war capability, and of this nation's character.

While Yamamoto's ""Sleeping Giant"" speech at the end of the film may be apocryphal, it captures his awareness of what Japan was getting itself into. His prediction that he could run rampant in the Pacific for maybe six months to a year after the attack, but could promise no further victory for Japan beyond that, proved true.

In this viewer's opinion, the best war films are always those that blend the points of view from both sides.

""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" takes well the sage advice ""Know Thy Enemy"".

In light of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""'s adherence to historic accuracy throughout the film, it earned that bit of artistic license with Yamamoto's fictional - yet dramatic - ""Sleeping Giant"" speech.

If you really want a good accurate movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor, make it ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".

You'll be glad you did.

271247,5,6300246876,"Unlike the mediocre and Disneyfied 'Pearl Harbor' with its cheesy love story and splashy special effects, Tora! Tora! Tora! actually has the feel that you are reliving history. The drama of the moment when the United States is dragged into World War II does not need embellishment, and the filmmakers here are wise in their use of restraint. You are struck by the missed clues that doomed thousands, the all-too-slow teletypes and relaxation that turns into realization and then to horror. This is a movie that honors the dead, and yet seeks to understand the Japanese as well and portray them realistically.

The heroics on the ground in the face of daunting odds and total surprise are inspiring even in their futility. As is the end of the movie, which doesn't feel compelled (unlike in Pearl Harbor) to tell you what happened next. We know what happened next. The country was ripped from its complacency, and was changed forever. And mushroom clouds eventually came to Japan. There is a solemnity to the whole enterprise, an understanding of the tragedy that befell the Navy that day that will live in infamy.

Sometimes they really go overboard but it's entertaining (""Braveheart"" ""They Died With Their Boots On"") and others they fail miserably (""Midway"" ""Battle of the Bulge""). This film is the best of both worlds-reasonably accurate and entertaining. And for it's time (1970) the special effects are exceptional-this is how films of this genre should be done.",1121299200,2,465,5.297297297297297
271249,5,6300246876,"Nominated for five Academy Awards (most of them related to effects and visuals), and winner of the Oscar for Special Visual Effects, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a true Hollywood blockbuster. Long before the star-studded, over-hyped Disney film Pearl Harbor, film creators gave us a much better picture of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Often shown on the History Channel, Tora! Tora! Tora! almost fits the definition of a documentary. The film doesn't employ sideshow tricks such as love triangles (i.e. Pearl Harbor) in order to create audience interest. In fact, few of the actors stand out on their own. Instead, each character plays his part as it most likely unfolded in real life - and the real life version of Pearl Harbor is interesting enough on its own...

Tora! Tora! Tora! originates as the Japanese call sign for a full-fledged attack on the American naval installation at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese Empire continues its expansion throughout the Asian-Pacific realm, the United States institutes economic sanctions. As further divisions threaten to bring about war between the two nations, Japanese admirals convene in order to plan a surprise preemptive attack on the United States Navy in the event that war becomes inevitable.

Among those present is Admiral Yamamoto (So Yamamura) who agrees to carry out the plan, but as a man who studied extensively in the United States, he believes his fellow countrymen underestimate the resolve and the industrial might of the American people. Nonetheless, the Japanese continue their surveillance of Pearl Harbor with a plan to annihilate the US Navy and its vital fleet of aircraft carriers.

Meanwhile, certain people in Washington are intercepting coded messages between the island of Japan and its ambassador to the United States. As the rumor of a Japanese attack begins to take hold, officials attempt to convince the top leaders in the chain of command. But the idea of such a bold and unprovoked attack is difficult to comprehend.

When the Japanese arrive at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, they realize their plan has worked well. They achieve total surprise, and the call of Tora! Tora! Tora! goes out to the fleet, launching a second wave of attack planes. The Japanese attacks sink several battleships, but not a single carrier (the carriers unexpectedly left the harbor to practice maneuvers). Threatening to annihilate Pearl Harbor, the Japanese are unexpectedly called back by a conservative admiral, leaving the scene before than can inflict maximum damage. The mistake is eloquently expressed by Admiral Yamamoto who fears that his countrymen have ""only managed to awaken a sleeping giant""...

Despite its 1970 release date, Tora! Tora! Tora! remains a wonderful film that can hold its own in the special effects department with any modern day blockbuster. In fact, the older camera technology makes the scenes subconsciously feel more realistic than modern day films such Pearl Harbor. If you're looking for a good, suspenseful movie (and one which teaches history too), then you'll be hard pressed to find a better option than Tora! Tora! Tora! One of the best war films of all time, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a definite must see film...

271250,2,6300246876,"There are many things for which TORA, TORA, TORA is worthy of praise.  It is an historically accurate film and many regard it as a triumph of history over Hollywood entertainment.  For all of those who have recently trashed films like THE PATRIOT and U-571 for the ridiculously one-sided storylines they offer, this is the film they are looking for.  TORA, TORA, TORA provides a balanced perspective on the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese are depicted as real human beings in this film and we are reminded of the reasoning surrounding their attack.  On the flip side, the lack of American concern and preparation is communicated as well, suggesting that some of the damage incurred on that day was due to mismanagement problems.  I was quite impressed with the way that a balanced history manages to come through in this film.  Additionally, I was struck in awe at several points (such as when the Japanese planes are taking off from their aircraft carriers) and was forced to imagine what it must have been like to have witnessed it.

However, for all of its achievements, I question TORA, TORA, TORA's effectiveness as a motion picture.  For my money, I would rather see character development and a personalized story in a major motion picture.  As some reviewers have commented, the only real star in the film is the special effects during the battle sequence.  Essentially, TORA, TORA, TORA feels like a documentary.  Of course, isolating personal stories during a war can lead to over-the-top, feel-good-about-America pictures and I am certainly not recommending these types of films.  But one does not have to sacrifice interest and character development when making an historically accurate film.

Moreover, TORA, TORA, TORA seemed far too long.  Several scenes could have been effectively edited down to a fraction of their length and the battle sequence at the end, while thrilling, is painfully long.  In this way, the film manages to convey the depressing magnitude of the attack simply by making us watch it for thirty minutes.  Another example occurs during a scene I enjoyed in which the Japanese airplanes are taking off from their aircraft carriers.  The scene is beautiful, particularly with the sun just beginning to rise on the horizon.  But did we have to see every plane take off?  Is five minutes of planes taking off the most effective use of time?  I do not think so.

Overall, TORA, TORA, TORA is a great achievement in historical accuracy and I think it should be shown in history classes.  I just do not think it will be shown on my own television screen that often.  It lacks the character development, emotion, and pacing to deserve that honor.",1113523200,19,2704,4.879385964912281
271251,5,6300246876,"Tora Tora Tora"" is a classic WWII film, and probably the most honest in its portrayal of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  It is the kind of film that gets shown in history classes in High School, which is where I saw it for the first time. The half-American/half-Japanese production is a shinning example of dedication to the facts over dramatic license when telling a historical story. The dual production shows heroes and incompetents on both sides of the conflict.

While the proposed David Lean/Kurosawa Akira film never came to pass (And what a movie that would have been!), directors Kinji Fukasaku (""Battle Royale"") and Richard Fleischer (""The Vikings"") do their able best.  Fukasaku maintained the integrity of the Japanese side production, and it is almost shocking to see Japanese people acting like actual Japanese people in an American war film, rather than as stereotyped monsters or amusing caricatures.  He had little control over the final product, however, as all editing was done on the American side, and Fleischer simply removed any of the footage that he didn't like.

The DVD for ""Tora Tora Tora"" is a real treat.  The new 20-minute documentary, ""Day of Infamy,"" discusses the historical accuracy of the film, with several University professors weighing in.  The commentary track is excellent, with a dialog between director Richard Fleisher & Japanese film historian Stuart Galbraith (""The Emperor and the Wolf."")  Kurosawa-expert Galbraith details the behind-the-scenes troubles with Kurosawa that led to his removal from the film, although, perhaps in respect to his commentary partner, he does not mention Kurosawa's dissatisfaction with the American director.  The commentary is much more involved with the filmmaking process itself, rather than the Pearl Harbor attack, and is a nice compliment to the more-focused documentary.",1108166400,2,1851,5.311643835616438
271252,5,6300246876,"These words are spoken by Adm Yamamoto at the end of the film whne he has learned that that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that he planned was even more successful than they had hoped in their wildest dreams...and yet the American aircraft carriers were not there.  Thus, this film which shows the planning and execution of the attack, ends on a note of simultaneous Japanese exaltation and foreboding about the future.

This film is a must for anyone who cares to be an informed citizen.  It not only about the past, but also about the present (for example 9/11): what a bold thinking group of men can accomplish if they put their minds to it, the complex relations between the United States, Japan and their neighbors like China and Korea, national arrogance and overconfidence (""it can't happen here""), looking for scapegoats after a disaster, and much more.

From the cinematic viewpoint, the battle scenes are just breathtaking, especially the attack on Hickam Field were we see aircraft blowing up right and left and the air battles where two incredibly brave American fighter pilots take on the whole air fleet that carried out the attack returning to their aircraft carriers.  I also love the scene where we see the Japanese strike force taking off from their carriers just as dawn is breaking.  E G Marshall puts in a fine performance as Col Rufus Bratton, an American intelligence officer who is convinced that the Japanese are going to attack, as he is trying to awaken the military establishment in Washington to the danger.  Also Jason Robards does a good job as the hapless General Walter Short who is in charge of defending Hawaii from naval and air attack (Robards was actually at Pearl Harbor during the attack so I am sure he had no trouble ""getting into"" the part!).  Having real Japanese actors speaking Japanese (unlike the movie ""Midway"") gives the film a real feel of authenticity.

Having said these good things about the film, I would like to point out a few weaknesses (1)  I can't understand why the American naval personnel are always shown wearing their white dress uniforms-it makes them look silly, (2) this film was made in 1970 when the US was bending over backwards to be nice to Japan because of the Cold War and the unpopularity of the presence of the American military bases in Japan resulting from the American war in Vietnam.  As a result, they repeated the line which was propagated at the time, saying that the Japanese intended to present a declaration of war before the attack commenced (the typists supposedly worked too slowly and so it was finally presented to Secretary of State Cordell Hull AFTER the attack).  In reality, the infamous ""14-part message"" Ambassadors Namura and Kurusu were supposed to deliver was NOT a declaration of war at all, but simply an announcement that the Japanese were breaking off negotiations.  Also, the film claims that Emperor Hirohito was personally opposed to going to war with the US, but being a ""prisoner"" of the cabinet, had no choice but to go along with them.  It is now widely believed by historians that the Emperor was, in fact, a strong supporter of Japanese aggression.  Also, there is some evidence that he was personally involved in war crimes.  However, all this was hushed up after the war in order to make the American occupation of Japan run smoothly, and this film simply continues this line.

One important point to keep in mind is that, although FDR did want to get the US into the war with Germany, he most certainly did NOT want to get into war with Japan if he could help it.  A war in the Pacific would only divert resources away from the European Theater of Operations, which he viewed as most important.  This conclusively disproves the conspiracy theories that claim the FDR  deliberately left Pearl Harbor undefended in order to shock the American people into going to war.

In spite of these criticisms, I still rate the film as 5-stars.",1105574400,7,3953,4.766862170087976
271303,4,6300246876,"-the english translation of the title.

Tora! Tora! Tora! was the japanese code signaling the Japanese naval officers to proceed with the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Another reviewer claims that the word can also mean kill, although I can't confirm that.  This movie only won an academy award for best visual effects in 1970, most other awards going to Patton that same year.  The movie was directed by three men, was based on two books, one of the same title written by Prange, the other written by Farago and entitled The Broken Seal: operation magic and the secret road to Pearl Harbor.  The movie is somewhat unbiased in that both sides' reactions and story are represented.  The quote from Admiral Yamamoto which dramatically ends the movie was never said by him: ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.""  Awake, though, the Americans, they sure did.  I didn't realize how significant the damage done was until I saw this movie.  A sizable number of the Pacific fleet was benignly lingering in Pearl Harbor that Sunday morning and sunk or left in flames a few hours later as the Japanese airmen flew back unscathed to their base.  However, as another Japanese commander noted, none of the American aircraft carriers were there.  The American side was beset with communication problems of various sorts with too many men crying wolf weeks before the attack.  I'd like to read the books or those of others to understand what exactly happened on the American side that resulted in this ""day of infamy"".  I did like this docu-drama, accurately reliving that fated day.",1105142400,2,1621,4.787769784172662
271304,5,6300246876,"If you viewed the recent ""Pearl Harbor,"" which makes the attack a backdrop to a romantic love triangle, you won't be disappointed with this original version of the dastardly Japanese sneak attack on the American Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. I had the immense good fortune to see it again with some survivors after revisiting the Arizona Memorial in my hometown of Honolulu. It registered with me as deeply as when it premiered 35 years ago. You will find in this film a concerted effort to faithfully re-chronicle the events leading up to the attack from both the Japanese and American sides. Lacking film stars, the historical tale is allowed to stand on its own with some roles played by actors who actually resemble their real-life counterparts. Moreover, the film included actual aircraft and facilities from that era rather than relying on models or replicas. It avoids the dry documentary style while unfolding disparate events in an easy-to-follow sequence. The attack through the beautiful mountain ridge along the west coast of O'ahu (over what is now Scofield Barracks) is accurately depicted (an area, incidentally, now off-limits to civilians) and enhances the sense of brutal shock of it all on what would have been just another tranquil Sunday morning in paradise. Yet the directors resist the tawdry temptation to overdramatize events, instead allowing the diplomatic intrigue and military planning to speak for themselves. In doing so, the directors enable Admirial Yamamoto's prophetic words at film's end to have a greater impact, serving as a sober reminder of how Japanese jingoism subdued better strategic reasoning. [P.S. this was the not the first attack on American soil since the Revolutionary War, as an official reviewer with obviously limited historical understanding noted].",1100995200,4,1813,5.27681660899654
271305,5,6300246876,"This movie is right up there with band of brothers, saving private ryan, apocalypse now, platoon in terms of great war movies.

Tora really hits the nail on the head with the accurate portrayal of events leading up to the attack and really comes to a climax with the spectacular battle scene.  I could not believe some of the stunts in the film...the sequence on the airstrip were real live actors or stunt men but they came so close to being killed on film it was amazing.  There were planes exploding like 5 feet away from them and these guys were literally running for their lives...you actually have to pause and remember that this is a movie!

I loved the drama of the japanese actors..you can just sense the pride and mindset of the japanese warrior...I can watch tora over and over again and enjoy it just as much as the first time seeing it.

I find it ironic how japan entered the war only to force ""negotiations"" with the USA knowing full well they could not defeat the US military in a war.  Admiral yamamoto said he could raise havoc for one year against the americans but after that it was unknown.  Turned out he was absolutely correct in his prediction.  I don't think Japan could have won the war even if it destroyed the aircraft carriers at pearl harbor or won at midway.  Japan's objective was not to invade the USA but to control asia and all of its natural resources....Japan only attacked the USA to prevent them from interferring with their conquests in asia.  Japan miscalculated that the US could not reach japan in bombing attacks they never thought they could set up bases only 300 miles away from japan....japan's navy would have never allowed it so they assumed.",1097798400,5,1691,4.569536423841059
271306,4,6300246876,"This Pearl Harbor movie still remains the best treatment of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. What really works with this film was that both sides are accurately, fairly and without much bias, portrayed by the filmmakers. The internal struggles within the Japanese leadership as well as complacency of the Americans were clearly shown.

This movie remains totally superior to that overblown mess of the movie that came out several years ago called ""Pearl Harbor"", probably one of the worst movies ever made so far in this century.

It bit ironic but I thought that the Japanese scenes were done better then the American scenes. Japanese scenes seem to have more drama, better script and better direction. American scenes seem to be bit flat in many areas. The special effects for the movie still haven't aged that much. Its still as impressive as I first saw it back in the 1970s.

As for the DVD, its cheap, the anamorphic transfer proves to be quite excellent, wide screem format really helped this movie and its unthinkable to watch it in ""TV format"". What a waste that would be. The DVD don't have much extra outside of a short 20 minute documentary but I enjoyed the commentary by Richard Fleischer and Stuart Galbraith. The sound is in DD 4.1 and it seem to be pretty clear and strong to my humble speaker system.

271307,5,6300246876,"I just watched Tora! Tora! Tora! for about the fourth time, after being away from it for about 10 years. This is done in documentary style, and according to the commentary basically all incidents are true.

I had a chance to see part of the filming in 1969, on North Cane Street in the town of Wahiawa. We watched with fascination as one scene was shot over and over again. This was a street allegedly in downtown Honolulu. The young man delivering the telegram to Fort Shafter is pulling out of the alley on his motorcycle. Then the camera catches the Japanese zeros flying overhead, signifying that it is too late for telegrams. The person who actually delivered the telegram in his youth was a Mr. Fujimoto, who was on the set as a consultant. Unfortunately, almost the entire sequence was left out of the final cut.

Despite this, both the film and the DVD extras get five stars. The short called ""Day of Infamy"" adds to the film and clarifies specific historical points. And the running directors commentary explains the obstacles that had to be overcome in this joint U.S.-Japanese effort, including the different cultural perspectives in how to put everything together. Plus that, it explains many technical details that went into making the film. A valuable resource for amateur and professional filmmakers alike.

The feature and the DVD extras can be enjoyed at different levels and be revisited over and over. I myself spent over 5 hours in one day going through the whole thing.

 Forget it!

 If you want to have the actual story of what ""really"" happened on December 1941, then you have to go back to this movie made in 1970.

 ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a vision from both sides of the coin, not just the American one.

 ""Pearl Harbor"" is more a love story in its context and has only one vision, the unilateral and unnecessary patriotic American one.

 This is not history as it should be told.

 ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" was the codename given by the Japanese fleet to its carrier pilots to start the attack on Pearl Harbor.

 This is far less a shooting war movie, than an actual historic recreation of facts happening on a certain month, week, day and moment in 1941.

 Everything is told, from the burocracy involved (slow at that, as usual), to the actual military decisions on both sides and on the ground.

 The attack, when it comes, is a majestic recreation that, once watched side by side with the actual documentary footage available, makes you realize that were it in black & white, one could not distinguish its differences.

 That's how accurate it is!

 Expenses were not spared at all in doing this recreation. The aircraft used are all faithful reconstructions (a rarity!).

 All the actors involved (American and Japanese) have played their roles with outmost accuracy and sense of drama.

 The watcher is taken in and left wondering ""what next"", even if he already knows the story. Not a moment passes in boredom.

 This is another fine movie I would recommend for schools and war museums.

 It is a movie for thinkers, not warmungers, and it is certainly not one for those who always love to wave flags around.

 In other words, this is history, told at its best.",1090368000,,1765,4.62987012987013

I remember when Tora! was in the theater while I was in high school...and that I had no interest in seeing it at the time. This is a serious-minded, fact-based film of epic proportion. It has similarities to Das Boot in that part of the story is told from the US enemy's point of view. And, oddly enough, I found the structure of the film to be somewhat reminiscent of The Deer Hunter, or even King Solomon's Mines [1950], in that there is a long, detailed build-up of the story prior to any action sequences. And once the action arrived, I sat there thinking, ""How did they do this?"" Especially considering the fact that this was 1970. But the biggest reward for me is the story itself, and the non-Hollywood way in which it is told here. No one would get financial backing today for a film of this expense coupled with such a non-fiction approach.",1089590400,,947,4.479768786127168
271310,5,6300246876,"Tora! Tora! Tora! is the single best movie ever made about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  It features excellent performances from such actors as James Whitmore, E.G. Marshall, Jason Robards and Martin Balsam.  The special effects are far more convincing than what's in modern movies.  It also has some of the best movie music of all time.  Best of all, the movie shows the sheer complacency on the U.S. side that enabled the Japanese to successfully mount the surprise attack.
Tora! Tora! Tora! is far superior to any other movie ever made about Pearl Harbor.  In fact, it is one of the absolute best movies ever made about World War II.  It is a classic motion picture in its own right.

And showed how Roosevelt, who was informed of the results of the (fantastic) Intelligence work -they even could pin the time of the attack- decided to keep it under wraps: so that, without any prior warning, the damage would be maximum, and the shock upon American people would be such as to suppress the reluctance they still got towards entering the war.

271312,5,6300246876,"And really, a ground-breaking film.  The format of the film set the tone and presentation for a host of war movies that followed (see 'Midway', for example).

Based on research of Gordon Prange, author of ""At Dawn We Slept"", Tora! Tora! Tora! is a very accurate portrayal of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

There have been several treatments of the famous battle (as one-sided as it was), including the recent (and crummy) ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001).  This is the best.

As other reviews have pointed out, the attack was an extremely successful one for the Japanese from a military standpoint.  By 1941, the only check on Japanese expansion in the Pacific was the United States Navy.  Yamamoto's plan was bold and creative, but it depended a lot upon luck, as the film and the book point out.  The United States had installed a radar facility that operated part-time, and did detect the first wave of incoming Japanese planes.  The US was more concerned with sabotoge, and parked their planes closely together.  The Japanese mini-submarine that was detected and sunk off Pearl Harbor should have raised alarms, but didn't.

It all points to a fundamental principal of war.  Everyone got complacent.  We thought Pearl was too far from Japan to attract an attack of that magnitude.  We thought we would see the fleet or at least the Japanese planes long before they would present a threat.  Our technology (radar) provided an extra safeguard, but wasn't properly used. Our cracking of the Japanese diplomatic code provided an extra sense that we would know of an attack prior to it happening.

I've read the transcript of the congressional inquiry into the attack that was undertaken in the late 1940s.  It is fascinating.  They point out one of the reasons we were complacent.  There had been 'war warnings' sent out several times in late fall 1941, warning of an imminent Japanese attack somewhere in the Pacific.  Nothing happened.  This bred a laissez-faire attitude toward imminent attack.

The only thing that saved the US Navy was the US carriers were at sea, and that main target of the Japanese escaped unharmed, a fact that was to be of great importance to the subsequent conduct of the war.

Some reviewers here have expressed surprise that the US was so badly fooled.  One reviewer here calls the US's actions 'slipshod and arrogant'.  Huh?  We prepared for the danger that we expected, not something nobody believed could have occurred. 'Blithely oblivious'?  Again, incorrect, as the proceedings of the congressional investigation have pointed out. 'Dry and boring'?  What movie did that reviewer watch? 'Incomprehensible decision' to park the planes closely together?  How about the dangers of sabotage?  'We didn't expect an attack'?  Not accurate at all.  The US was painfully aware of the danger Japan presented.

The US attitude is understandable, though, when you realize they were viewing a far-off war in Europe, and no one then imagined a war in their own backyard.  It is hard to expect the unexpected.

Very Highly recommended!",1080259200,2,3071,4.966601178781925
271343,4,6300246876,"I just watched this last week (Mar 2004). It took over an hour for the movie to give you the background before you got close to the battle scene. But the final hour was great, including a scene with a woman flying instructor being dumbfounded as her paltry biplane is taken over by a hundred zeros and bombers.
The fx were great, even by 2004 standards. No fake CG stuff, you know all those planes on the tarmac were really blowing up. In todays movies, you just see a big fireball with some unrecognizable parts flying about. In this film, you saw propellers flying straight off the engine, unattached engines sliding into buildings, cowlings popping straight up, and fiery airplanes with no driver hitting other parked airplanes causing a chain reaction explosion. Plus they managed to capture the real sound when each part hit the pavement. I don't remember too many films that ever did that.
The fx left me saying ""Wow! I bet that was hard to set up!""",1078963200,2,955,4.623529411764705
271344,5,6300246876,"I first saw Tora! Tora! Tora! (Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! in Japanese) in 1974, when I was 20 years old on Atlanta's Channel Two. As strange as this may sound, I have always liked movies about World War II. My stepfather had served in the Navy during the war and in fact he had joined the service shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which is the subject of this 2 hour and 25 minute-long Japanese-American 1970 production.
This movie was directed by several directors including Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasuka, but the American version (yes, there is a Japanese version) gives the credit to veteran director Richard Fleischer. Based on Gordon W. Prange's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and Ladislas Farago's  ""The Broken Seal"", the film accurately depicts the events on both sides of the Pacific leading up to the stunning attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet on Sunday, December 7, 1941.
Even though it covers an 18-month period between Admiral Yamamoto's (Soh Yamamura) initial planning for Operation Hawaii and the attack itself, Tora! Tora! Tora! (the title refers to the code used to inform the Japanese that the Americans had been caught by surprise) never drags or seems dull. I learned, for instance, that Japanese Ambassador Nomura was a skilled and honorable diplomat who did not know what his country's military leaders were planning, and that he hoped to avoid war. I was also stunned by how General Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) was so preoccupied by the threat of sabotage from Hawaii's 125,000 Japanese inhabitants that he foolishly parked all the bombers and fighters in Hickam and Wheeler Fields in neat rows, supposedly to make them easier to guard but actually making them sitting ducks.
What amazed me about watching this movie is how clueless Pearl Harbor's defenders were on that Sunday morning. Though many people think the first shot of the Pacific War was fired by the Japanese, it was actually fired by the USS Ward on a Japanese midget submarine trying to sneak into the harbor. This happened roughly an hour before the first bomb fell on Battleship Row. I would have thought that the report of an unknown submarine being fired upon in a restricted area would have alerted the whole fleet. Wrong! American officers in Oahu were so certain that the Japanese would be spotted long before they could launch a strike that Captain James Earle (Richard Anderson) asks for confirmation before he tells his superiors. This does not make Adm. Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam) very happy and I thought he was very angry that the Ward's initial report did not reach him in time.
The movie makes clear to the audience that history often hinges on small but significant details. Who would have thought that the fate of two great nations would be decided by a diplomat's slow typing speed, or that a report of a large radar blip off to the north of Oahu would be received with the phrase, ""Well, don't worry about it.""? It sounds like bad fiction but everything in this movie is based on historical fact.
Tora! Tora! Tora! has incredible battle scenes. Most of the aerial scenes were shot using either vintage planes or realistic replicas (because there are no flying Zero fighters, T-28 Texans were modified to look like the famous Japanese planes). The Navy actually allowed 20th Century-Fox to film in and around Pearl Harbor and rented a World War II era carrier that was to be decommissioned to serve as a stand in for the Japanese carrier. Clever editing, good miniature effects and carefully built live action sets give the illusion that one is actually reliving the Day of Infamy.
The 60th Anniversary Special Edition DVD was released around the same time as 2001's Pearl Harbor. It features an all new 20-minute documentary, director's commentary, the orginal theatrical trailer, and restores the movie to its original widescreen format. It has four audio tracks (English 4.1, the commentary, English Dolby Surround, French Mono), and subtitles in English and Spanish.",1073865600,230,3988,4.916913946587537
271345,3,6300246876,"The film has real Japanese actors directed by a Japanese moderate director.

271346,5,6300246876,"There are not many movies that portray the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as anything but what it was--a carefully planned massive assault on a totally unprepared United States naval base.  TORA TORA TORA is not Hollywood's typical war movie that places character exposition at the forefront.  Here directors Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku for the Japanese and Richard Fleischer for the United States detail a film that is more documentary than character driven.  Yet, despite this sense of hidden-camera reality that focuses on all ranks from admiral to seaman, the actors succeed in infusing the film with a feeling that on both sides there were no heroes or villans.  In fact, if there is any villainy, it is not the attacking Japanese who must wear the mantle of evil but rather the slipshod arrogance of those who were entrusted to defend Pearl Harbor against just the kind of annihilation that struck on that Sunday morning in December, 1941.  The Japanese side is told primarily through the perspective of Admiral Yamamoto (So Yamamura), who was in overall command of the attack fleet, and Lt. Commander Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura), who was one of the Zero pilots on the first attack wave.  Yamamoto is a cautious commander, one who has no political agenda, but is determined to carry out his objective exactly even if it means not taking advantage of unexpected opportunities to wreak further destruction on American ships.  He will preserve his fleet above all else.  Fuchida has a much more narrow view; when he sees that a second attack wave is needed to finish the job, he is appalled that Yamamoto has instead ordered the fleet to return to Japan.  Neither of them is presented as the stereotyped buck-toothed sabre-rattling Jap so often presented in a previous generation's war movie.  Each in his own way is strictly business.  The American side is anchored by Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel and Richard Anderson as Captain Earle.  Kimmel is a competent commander who discovers too late that bureaucratic bungling of misguided messages can have the most tragic of consequences.  When the attack begins, he is stunned but quickly organizes what defenses he has.  The fall guy is Earle, who might have gained a precious few hours of advanced warning had he heeded the implications of frantic radio messages suggesting an attack was imminent.  Yet, Earle is a one-dimensional stick man who collectively symbolizes the head-in-the-sand myopia that then afflicted US military intelligence about the oncoming Rising Sun whirlwind.
TORA TORA TORA is a film of rapidly shifting points of view.  The first three quarters is a microscopic analysis of the events preceding the attack.  The Japanese are seen as supremely confident that they will achieve total surprise.  In fact, when the first Zero fighters are in view of Pearl, they are astounded to note that not one shot has been fired at them.  An American radar station operator notes that his radar screen shows a massive inflight of unidentified planes, but a call to his superiors results in his being told not to worry.  The American fleet and dozens of combat planes are neatly stacked in rows, just waiting to be picked off.  The Americans, by contrast, are blithely oblivious to what now seems like unmistakable warnings of looming disaster.  In Washington, Japanese ambassadors Nomura (Shogo Shimada) and Kurusu (Hisao Toake) wait patiently outside the door of Secretary of State Cordell Hull, knowing full well what was then occuring on the other end of the world.  For the briefest moment, Nomura is seen as a man who is profoundly saddened that he is a forced puppet mouthing words of a futile peace.
All of the behind the scenes style of film making is needed as a segue to the catastrophic air assault on Pearl. The attack, which lasts for an extended thirty minutes, is stunningly effective, even more so than the computer-enhanced graphics of the recent remake with Ben Affleck.  Essentially, the Japanese airplanes swoop down and destroy both docked ship and arrayed plane.  The return fire is piecemeal.  Here and there is a spirited ra-ta-ta by a lone America gunner.  The surprise is complete.  Three battleships are sunk, and nearly every plane is destroyed on the ground.  These scenes of carnage are difficult to watch, yet they serve to remind us that eternal vigilance is needed for a proud country to survive.  The dramatic focus of the movie is not on the destruction of the Pacific fleet at all, but surprisingly on the Japanese view of that destruction.  The Japanese had intended to declare war first, and then to attack, but a bungling on their part reversed this order.  A despondent Admiral Yamamoto concludes the film by noting to his otherwise jubilantly cheering subordinates: ""I can hardly imagine a way that is more likely to infuriate the Americans.  I fear that all we have done was to awaken a sleeping giant.""  TORA TORA TORA is unique among war films in that it shows that even in war, there are men of good conscience who are caught up in matters over which they have very little control.",1065484800,31,5094,4.919298245614035
271347,4,6300246876,"The attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday December 7, 1941 was one of the most signifcant events of the 20th century. It secured US entry into World War II which in turn helped in the victory in Europe over Nazi Germany.
A key feature of this movie is that it was a joint American-Japanese production and hence gives both perspectives and a balanced picture of the story. It is both a historically accurate account of the events and also a gripping and watchable film.
The first half of the movie maps out the events leading up to the attack, the question of why it happened is an important point for any event in history but particularly in this case.
The movie's second half is a stunning recreation of the devastating battle. Considering when it was filmed the effects of the battle compare favourably with those of the far more recent Pearl Harbor directed by Michael Bay.",1063756800,2,871,4.589743589743589
271348,4,6300246876,"Tora!  Tora!  Tora!  is a highly historical film that made an attempt to cover the entire ground of what happened on December 7th, 1941.  And I think they succeeded in doing this, giving us an education on how Pearl Harbor came about, why the Japanese bombed us, and what went wrong. I was very pleased with how this film was molded and crafted and how real the movie was.
Reading from other people's reviews, I have found that some complaints are about the length of the movie and that it is boring.  Well it is boring if history being converted to film bothers you.  But if you like to get down to the skinny of things and kinda find out why things happen, why 12/7/41 occured then this film is fascinating not boring.
Another complaint is how the Japanese are shown as smart and wise and the Americans as stupid or slow.  Well, to be honest, history says that is a correct analysis of the way things were.  Our command at Pearl Harbor was inept, they did stupid things, they made poor decisions, the White House made serious flaws that made way for the attack to become imminent.  And the Japanese were very determined, very ingenius on their planning of this attack.  They had a lot of time to think about this raid, so naturally when one is well organized that person is going to be portrayed as smart.  The Japanese out smarted us on that day, or as the film shows, that year of '41.
I liked how this film led up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, beginning several months prior to the raid.  This gave us an idea what was going on in both sides' minds.  It gave equal time to the Japanese strategists and to American high command and intelligence.  If anybody has a problem with a war film giving each side an equal balance in a film, as far as point of view, then don't watch this film.
My only concern for this film, that costed it one star, is that you never get to know any of the characters.  They are kind of distant characters, obviously just imitating historical people long gone, but even then I think the viewers would like to get to know the characters.  Because there were so many characters, and the point of views switches so often, I can see where this is a problem.  But it's the sacrifice you give when you have lots of characters you want to give equal perspectives to.  Still, one character you could really get to know in this film is something I still expected.
As a result to no real deep character you can follow in this film, this movie is nothing more but a historical documentary with movie drama and sequences.  And this is OK, it's a good 4 star war movie.  But it isn't the most entertaining either.  I do recommend this movie, but please don't watch it with the expectation of being entertained with action.  Watch it because you want to know more about what happened before and during December 7th, 1941.

271349,5,6300246876,"This in-depth portrayal of the infamous December 7, 1941 attack on the US Navy Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor is possibly one of the most researched and accurate historical films ever produced.  It provides a magnificent viewing experience, and despite not having the fancy and exuberant special effects that the recent flick ""Pearl Harbor"" was filled with, it is possibly the most enjoyable war movie you can watch.  Unlike the more recent film, which was undoubtedly directed at today's younger crowd, who (aside from myself and those like me) are less interested in history and more interested in lots of explosions and sweet tender emotions, this film did not blaspheme the attack by turning an account of it into a stupid love story.  It's just the politics, strategies, mistakes, and triumphs that made December 7, 1941 the saddest day in American history up until September 11 of 2001.
One of the greatest aspects of this film is that it sheds light on the absolute brilliance of the Japanese Naval strategists.  Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo and Commander Genda were three of the greatest military leaders/strategists of World War II, and possibly, of all time.  The film presents the attack not as a barbaric act of unprovoked massacre, as most Americans would like to think it was, but rather, as a decisive military move in the better interests of Japan.  After all, as (the character who played) Yamamoto stated in the film, the Americans would have been (and proved to be) the most difficult enemy that Japan had ever fought.  The attack was basically an act of desperation, as the warmongering Japanese Army, who controlled politics, blatantly rejected the Navy's pleas to avoid a war.  I was very happy to see this film treating the brilliant Japanese planners and pilots not as the heartless murderers that many ignorant Americans see them as, but rather as the national heroes that they had become for Japan by acting in what they believed was the best interest of their nation.  After all, isn't that how we think of our soldiers?  If it isn't, then we need to sit down and examine our conscience.
Even without the jazzy special effects, this film recreates the combat scenes very well.  Unless you're a computer geek who believes that special effects make a movie and the story line is just there for the hell of it, you won't notice any problem with the explosions and aerial combat.  In fact, the replica Japanese aircraft (BT-13s and AT-6s modified to look like A6M 'Zeke' [Zero] fighters, D3A1 'Val' dive bombers, and B5N2 'Kate' torpedo bombers) and American P-40s engaging in actual aerial maneuvering was much more spectacular than if it had been recreated on computer screens.  The pyrotechnics used were fantastic as well, and the scene of a B-17 landing with one wheel up was a scene to remember.  On a side note, if anyone was ever fortunate enough to catch the Commemorative Air Force's (formerly Confederate Air Force) reenactment of the attack at an air show, they actually had the B-17 ""Texas Raiders"" crank one wheel down and fly LOW over the runway to recreate that very scene!  I'm not sure if they still do that, but that was the kind of thing that made memories!
Overall, if you want a truly unbiased account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, without the liberal twist thrown in to make it look like our brass and President were helpless victims instead of revealing the mistakes made by the top levels of our government and armed forces, then you'll love ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in war movies, military history, naval warfare, aviation, or just plain great movies.",1061510400,6,3638,4.8341384863123995

271351,5,6300246876,"Sunday morning, December 7, 1941 was a very fateful day for the USA.  Without warning, the then militaristic Empire of Japan launched a highly successful sneak attack upon America's Pacific naval fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  21 naval vessels were sunk or severely damaged and nearly 200 aircraft (mostly on the ground) were destroyed.  Of the approximate 2,350 servicemen (naval, marine & army) and 49 civilians killed (a total of 2,409), 1,177 died on the USS Arizona alone.  Another 1,178 servicemen & civilians were wounded. The next day, war was declared by the U.S. on Japan following a moving speech by President Franklin Deleno Roosevelt.
29 years following the attack (1970), directors Richard Fleischer, Kinji Fukasaku, Toshio Masuda and Akira Kurosawa (who left the film before its completion) created a gripping dramatization of the events leading to and portraying the attack on Pearl Harbor in the film entitled ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".  The film does a superb job of trying to portray actual historic events by splitting its time almost evenly between both the US and Japanese sides.  On the US side, are Adm. Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam), Adm. 'Bull' Halsey (James Whitmore), Gen. Short (Jason Robards), Lt. Comdr. Kramer (Wesley Addy), Secretary of War Henry Stimson (Joseph Cotten) and Secretary of State Cordell Hull (George Macready) to name a few.  On the Japanese side are Admiral Yamamoto (S Yamamura), Cmdr. Genda (Tatsuya Mihashi), Lt. Cmdr. Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura), Adm. Nagumo (Eijir Tono), Gen. Hideki Tojo (Asao Uchida), Ambassador Nomura (Shogo Shimada) and Ambassador Saburo Kurusu (Hisao Toake) to name a few.  One aspect of the film that helps to maintain its staunch realism is that scenes with only Japanese actors use Japanese dialog with English subtitles rather than dubbing the English or having the Japanese actors speak in English with Japanese accents.  Another strength of the film is that is does not focus on one or two specific characters; instead, it allows viewers to see what happens with many characters.
Memorable scenes in the film include Ambassabor Kurusu signing the Tripartite Pact in 1940, internal politics within the Japanese government & military, poor decisions made by the U.S. forces at Pearl Harbor, geisha girls waving at practicing Japanese pilots, scenes involving Ambassador Nomura with Secretary Hull, the Japanese crews preparing for the attack and the attack itself.  Admiral Kimmel was in charge of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, General Short was in charge of the army forces.  Admiral Yamamoto was in charge of planning the attack, but the Japanese attack fleet was under the command of Admiral Nagumo.  The pilot in charge of the attack itself was Lt. Cmdr. Fuchida.
Since ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" was filmed in 1970, the special effects (which used a lot of models) may seem dated to people who prefer advanced computer graphics, but don't let lack of special effects technology deter you from enjoying this very gripping film.  The acting in the film is very good, keeping the viewers engaged while watching the events leading up to the attack, as well as the attack itself.  The attack itself is portrayed very well, as are the various mistakes made by U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor prior to the attack.  Overall, I rate ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
In comparison with the 2001 film ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is the superior of the two for being far more historically accurate and focusing on actual historic events.  In spite of using great special effects for the attack on Pearl Harbor itself, the 2001 film ""Pearl Harbor"" was extremely disappointing for essentially being a soap opera focused primarily upon a purely fictitious & melodramatic love triangle.",1059350400,5,3795,5.106623586429725

271374,4,6300246876,"Following in the tradition of Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day (which I erroneously said was the top draw of 1963; it was the second, actually), 20th Century Fox embarked on a risky venture: to tell the true story of Pearl Harbor. To do so, they chose the same style of international cooperative effort that had paid off so well for Zanuck and Fox in 1962: to use foreign (in this case, Japanese) and American directors and cast members.
Unlike The Longest Day, however, where most, if not all of the shooting was done in French studios and locations, Tora! Tora! Tora! would be shot on both sides of the Pacific, with a team of Japanese directors - who had replaced a difficult Akira Kurosawa - filming the Japanese sequences, and Richard Fleischer and his team helming the American sequences. The directorial credits would differ depending on which side of the Pacific the movie was released. In Japanese theaters, Toshio Oguni and Kinji Fukasuka got the directorial credit, while in the U.S. Richard Fleischer was the director. Since Fox was the releasing studio, the footage from Japan was integrated into Fleischer's Hawaiian and Washington footage under the American director's supervision at Fox studios in California.
Unlike 2001's popular yet fanciful ""Pearl Harbor"", this motion picture is as historically accurate as Hollywood (and its Japanese collaborators) could manage. And while history buffs may say the movie skips incidents integral to the Pearl Harbor story (such as the Japanese espionage efforts on Oahu, for instance), Tora! Tora! Tora! is a good introduction to the fascinating and very complex subject of how and why Japan struck on December 7, 1941. It also shows why America was caught unprepared even though war with Japan seemed inevitable.
Even though special effects now are far better than in 1969 (when this 1970 film was made), the movie's visuals have more punch than Michael Bay's fictitious version of the Day of Infamy. Even though there are a lot of miniature effects used, especially in the 30 minute sequence depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor, the use of real planes and locations give the audience a realistic version of the Japanese assault. Real planes are used whenever possible, and even the fake Zero fighters (in reality modified T-28 Texans made to look like Mitsubishi's Zeros) are more convincing than ILM's computer generated ones in ""Pearl Harbor.""
Like The Longest Day before it, Tora! Tora! Tora! tries to accurately recreate historical events as faithfully as possible. The buildup to the Day of Infamy covers almost 18 months' worth of events. Starting with Japan's alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and the growing strain in U.S.-Japanese relations, there are many scenes dealing with politics, intelligence gathering, failed diplomacy, and, finally, war. Because of this, and because in many cases the dialog has appeared in non-fiction history books, the acting of the great character actors seems to some a bit stiff and unnatural. But that should not deter new viewers from watching this movie.
A word of caution. This movie does not adhere to the FDR-knew-about-the-attack-and-allowed-it-to-happen revisionist theory. Most responsible historians reject it as nonsense. If viewers are looking for this pernicious and acrimonious version of the Pearl Harbor tragedy, then this movie is not for them.
As for the DVD: released almost at the same time as Michael Bay's 2001 movie, Tora! Tora! Tora! was given a new attractive package, and taking advantage of the DVD technology, restored to its original widescreen format. I had owned the VHS version for 12 years before I bought the DVD, and there is no comparison between the videotape's pan and scan ""full screen"" view and widescreen....I don't understand why anyone still likes full screen versions of movies that were shot on Cinema Scope or Panavision widescreen. The director's commentary is good and informative, the sound (Dolby Surround) is excellent, and the picture is sharp and clear. The theatrical trailer and a 20-minute documentary, Day of Infamy, are also included.
This is a DVD any serious history or war movie buff should have in his or her video library.",1053561600,,4200,5.123906705539358

It shows how many mistakes were made on the American side. We were truly caught with our pants down. The Japanese had an awesome naval defense, and I was puzzled how they devasted our naval defenses and did not finish the attack. This Pearl Harbor is the best movie ever,there is no contest. This one you have to see for yourself, why I rated it so high.

271376,5,6300246876,"Tora! Tora! Tora! remains an unprecedented motion picture achievement, a film presenting both sides of the attack on Pearl Harbor in a fact-based style rather than delving into such fictional storylines as star-crossed lovers for the heart of its presentation.  In a very real way, it is two movies in one, with one production crew telling the Japanese side of the story and another telling the American side.  All of the Japanese dialogue is subtitled in English, and this makes for a much more effective presentation than dubbing ever could.  There are a good many important characters on each side, with each one identified at his first appearance, but the necessarily somewhat choppy style of presentation can make it difficult to keep different characters distinguished at times.  The actors, for their part, are top-notch, with the American cast including such stalwarts as Jason Robards, Joseph Cotton, and E.G. Marshall.  Soh Yamamura gives a powerful portrayal of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the man who is in many ways the centerpiece of this drama and the character on whom the filmmakers rely in presenting the real message they attempt to convey.  While the diplomatic maneuvering and piling up of unforgivable American blunders in the weeks leading up to December 7, 1941, are quite interesting in and of themselves, it is the final 30-minute battle sequence that gives Tora! Tora! Tora! its real claim to fame.  This movie was released in 1970, but the special effects rival if not surpass, at least in my opinion, anything you see filmmakers doing today.  The explosions and carnage on the ground as well as the aerial maneuvers and dogfights in the air are just breathtakingly stunning.  No film can ever recapture the depth and destruction of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, but this movie is really quite extraordinarily realistic in its presentation.
While this is a fact-based account of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, one cannot proclaim it historically complete and accurate.  The Japanese, particularly in the person of Admiral Yamamoto, are presented in something of a sympathetic light.  Certainly, there were elements in the Japanese military who disagreed with such a bold attack against a potentially overpowering enemy, but this movie seems to shy away from assigning blame for such a cowardly first strike against American forces in the Pacific.  Certainly, there were diplomatic blunders that can explain Japan's violation of the Geneva Conventions but nevertheless such infamous things did happen.  On the American side, one is treated to an infuriatingly long list of incompetent men, actions, and decisions.  The blame for the disaster is spread widely as it should be, taking into account such matters as the incomprehensible decision of keeping all available planes parked closely together on the ground as well as the refusal of army brass in Washington to read signs that blazed as brightly as day from intercepted Japanese dispatches and warnings from a number of military and intelligence sources, but the movie never penetrates the doors of the White House to ask just what FDR knew and when he knew it, nor does it ask any questions at all of the British and the secret information Winston Churchill chose not to share with his American ""ally.""  For me to criticize this movie for ignoring these most controversial issues back in 1970 is just minor quibbling, however, as I truly deem this film to be perhaps the most realistic and impressive war movie ever made.  Its manner of presentation, dealing with events rather than central characters, is a weakness of sorts, one that saw it overshadowed in the year of its own release by George C. Scott's masterful portrayal of Patton, but clearly Tora! Tora! Tora! remains the definitive motion picture representation of the day that will live in infamy and the acts, decisions, and mistakes that led up to it.",1050883200,,3909,5.074882995319813

Just the facts and a fair account of events from both sides of the Pacific. Imagine that! A film that shows you both sides of the coin. I am continually amazed that this film was ever released in the United States, where we don't like to think of our enemies (or former enemies) as human beings with real concerns and conflicting motives.
Be forewarned though. Some of the dialogue in this film is quite awkward due to the need to tell a complex story within the framework of the film.

271378,5,6300246876,"Along with Patton, one of the better movies about WWII. Patton focusses on the European 'theatre' and largely on the personalities of Patton and his arch-rival, fellow Allied commander Montgomery, though both largely represent the Allied point of view, even if Tora attempts to be even-handed, without ultimately showing the extent to which Japan was being threatened, harassed and hounded by the US, which was determined to keep Japan a second or third-rate power in the Pacific. Blasted as the 'day of infamy' by FDR, this movie shows the attack as a desperate attempt by Japan to ward off American acts to curb Japanese aggression in Asia. Japan of course, saw European colonialism as hypocrisy.

At the present time (2003), North Korea's eccentric dictator blusters that 'an embargo would be an act of war'. In 1941, America had imposed an oil embargo on Japan - which in the end led to the attack on Pearl, which in turn justified the American nuclear attacks on Japan, which recent historians have judged were militarily unnecessary, as Japan was all too ready to surrender before they were dropped.....

Although a documentary-type film it is fascinating - the 2001-2 Pearl Harbour movie is contemptible by comparison.

The scenes of the Japanese carriers in the turbulent night seas are particularly realistic - one feels on is on the carriers seeing the Japanese planes take-off. Similarly, the bombing of the harbour is painstakingly recreated - no computer trickery here. And the music, a combo of Japanese and Western by Jerry Goldsmith - underscores the drama,the tragedy,the foreboding of greater tragedies to come - as well as the sense of inevitability.

Also this film shows more of how the Japanese had planned the attacked than that ridiculous remake.  Very well acted from gifted actors such as Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and E.G. Marshall, and other well acting from the unknown actors for some of us; Soh Yamamura as Yammamoto.  The entire action sequence of the bombing scene was done with great directing from both directors, and beautiful Oscar nominated photography by Charles F. Wheeler, Osami Furuya, Sinsaku Himeda, and Masamichi Satoh.  The Oscar winning special effects were amazing and a lot more realistic than a boucing ship in the remake (which is the worst thing they ever did since a ship can't exactly bounce in water).  The music score by Jerry Goldsmith keeps the film in good tension and never interferes with the action.

271381,5,6300246876,"This is a movie for history buffs as well as for those that just like a good movie.  It depicts Pearl Harbor with an ensemble cast, cohesive storytelling, effective special effects (even by today's standards), great cinematography, and excellent film editing.  The lack of romance and other sub-plots enhances the drama and tension of the event.  This is history at its finest, wrapped in storytelling as only Hollywood can do.
On December 7, 1941, 350 aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy, in two waves, conducted a surprise attack on the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Island, Oahu, Hawaii Islands.  While more successful than could have been reasonably expected (who could have known that it really would take the Americans completely by surprise?), it still fell short of being decisive.  The Pacific Fleet was devastated in a single air battle that lasted a bit under two hours.  In that short time the US lost 21 ships sunk or damaged out of the 90 or so that were at anchor in or near the harbor, or under way near the harbor.  This included all 8 battleships assigned to the Fleet.  Three of these, the West Virginia, the Oklahoma, and Arizona were sunk.  The West Virginia was later raised and returned to duty.  Most of the other vessels, including the other 5 battleships, were eventually repaired as well.  In addition to ship losses, 188 US aircraft were destroyed and another 159 damaged.  Although totals vary, some reports carry human losses at 2,403 dead (including 68 civilians) and 1,178 wounded (including 35 civilians).  No matter what the precise totals, they were high.
For all of this damage, it's important to understand what the Japanese missed.  Neither of the two Pacific Fleet carriers (Enterprise and Lexington) was in or near port that day, so they were unscathed.  Missing the carriers ultimately would prove grievous to Japanese strategy.  Moreover, a third wave scheduled to hit harbor installations, repair facilities, warehouses, and fuel dumps on Oahu was cancelled.
The story of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor cannot be told effectively without providing background on why and how it came to be, and the movie does just that.  The attack was rooted in the effect the Great Depression had on Japan's economy, which stimulated their desire to control the natural resources needed to fuel their economy; Japanese militant expansionism, which put them on a collision course with the US; and Japanese military culture and tradition, which made them willing to take on a world power significantly their superior and which also believed in initiating hostilities by sudden, overwhelming attack; and the war Europe.
There were many in the Imperial Japanese Navy that understood the fearsomeness of what they were getting into.  Ironically, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (S Yamamura), the mastermind of the strategy to strike the American fleet at Pearl felt this way.
The movie pointed out that the Japanese diplomatic ultimatum was not presented until after the attack started and points to this as one of the reasons behind the massive US public embitterment after the attack.  Hence, Admiral Yamamoto's doleful warning (and the most memorable line from the movie), ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""  (The second most memorable line is by an old man fishing while warplanes are practicing their low-level runs, ""Navy pilots attract geisha girls, but they frighten the fish.""  It's the same all over, I guess.)
While it doesn't delve into all of the geopolitical issues as much as it could, it does provide an understanding of the events that led up to the attack and the devastation it caused, with an even-handedness that is refreshing.  This starts from the very beginning of the movie where the credits are alternated between the American cast and film crew and the Japanese, and continues throughout the movie as scenes shift back and forth between the Japanese and American perspectives.
Particularly effective is how the movie builds tension as the Japanese plan is put into action, alternating between the Japanese strike force and the Americans.  The Japanese fleet sails determinedly through the stormy northern Pacific while the American intelligence staff at the War Department in Washington becomes increasingly frustrated as they attempt to raise the alarm.  The Americans' misguided posture is juxtaposed with the almost youthful exuberance of the Japanese flight crews and maintenance teams as they continue their training and preparation shipboard.  Their enthusiasm is contrasted with the solemnity of their Shinto prayer and the tension of their senior officers.  The tension mounts as the director employs the Gettysburg-esque technique of using maps to show the fleet's progress toward the Islands.  It culminates in the dawn launch, with engine exhausts aflame, large formations of planes circling overhead as they form up before departing for the final air leg to their target, and the unsuspecting, unconcerned American fleet awakening on a lazy, sunny December morning in Hawaii, feeling safe.
If there is any noteworthy failing, it is that the move fails to depict the pathos of war - the overwhelming of the base (and presumably the civilian) medical facilities, the pain and suffering of incapacitating injuries, the civilian casualties, the mass of dead, injured, and struggling men in the water, the frantic attempts to escape by men trapped below decks in sunken and overturned ships.
While it provides an excellent history lesson, the movie also has the look and feel of a good story.  The story it tells is two-fold.  It tells of the misguided desperation of the Japanese that led them to take on the United States (if their post-war success is any standard for comparison).  It also speaks to America's arrogance in 1941.  We knew Japan was dangerous, but didn't expect them to come at us the way they did.  Our belief in ourselves got in our way.  In the end the American deaths at Pearl Harbor resulted from the failure of our imagination.  We just didn't think this attack would happen.",1039824000,4,6106,5.066933066933067
271392,5,6300246876,"Most of the other reviews have covered much of the good points and bad points, so let me keep this short:
Tora! Tora! Tora! was made by both an American and Japanese production team whose job was to put on film BOTH sides of the attack.  The DVD comes with a 20 minute documentary on the attack and the movie also comes with a commentary by the American Director Richard Fleischer and a Historian on Japanese Film Stewart Galbraith.  For a lover of history, both American and Japanese, this film will touch your heart with not just the cold facts, but is also with scenes of horror and humor, TRUE scenes, carefully placed into the movie by people who want to tell the true tale.  If you want opera and computer designed explosions, watch 'Pearl Harbor'.  If you want the TRUTH of the 'Day of Infamy' get this film.",1039219200,12,815,4.449664429530201
271393,5,6300246876,"Much has been made about the events surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in recent months.  With last year's release Michael Bay's melodramatic travesty ""Pearl Harbor"", one is made to look at the events leading up to and occuring on that day, December 7th, 1941.  If you want to know the true story about Pearl Harbor, then ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is the movie to see.  Whereas ""Pearl Harbor"" was just using the Japanese attack as a backdrop to tell 5th-class love story, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" sticks to telling the story as it happened.  The scenes dealing with the United States are filmed by an American director, while the scenes dealing with Japan are filmed by a Japanese director.  Each side is given a fair treatment in this movie.  There is no portrayal one side being good and the other being evil.

  ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is an event-driven movie, not a character-driven one.  Where some people have seen the lack of some central character, or traditional hero, on either side to be a detriment to the movie, it is really a benefit.  It is truly a movie of support roles, much like the militaries that battled that day operated.  No one single person rose to the forefront on either side.  The purported leaders on either side, Admiral Yamamoto in Japan and Admiral Kimmel in Pearl Harbor, are conflicted, somewhat flawed leaders whose actions and decisions are the product of those who outrank them.

  This movie does not portray Yamamoto as some raving mad war dog who wants nothing more than destroy the U.S.  He is a conflicted man who wants to avoid war at all costs, but knows that when that route is unavoidable, that he must develop and plan the best attack possible upon U.S. forces.  Some then (and now) have seen his actions as cowardice, but ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" shows that they are the carefully thought out actions of a man who knew the consequences involved.

  Similarly, history has been unkind to Admiral Kimmel for his handling of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  At the time, and in years since, he has shouldered the blame for unprepared state of the U.S. fleet for the Japanese attack.  Yet, he was the victim of the actions, or inactions, of his superiors much the same way Yamamoto was.  The U.S. knew Japan was rattling its collective saber, but did not believe that it would have the audacity to attack a U.S. target.  The Philipines or Wake Islands was seen as a much more likely target.  As shown throughout this movie, select members of the military began to piece together that Japan was planning an attack and that it was very likely to happen at Pearl Harbor.  However, the ignorant belief among most that this would not be possible led to the institutional failure that prevented the appropriate alerts and warnings to make their way to Kimmel in time to prepare for the attack.  It should be noted that a telegram that was supposed to alert Kimmel that the attack was imminent arrived in his hands several hours after the battle was over.

  Movies like ""Pearl Harbor"" only give the events of that day a cursory treatment, as it seems to get in the way of the next sappy love scene.  Yet, even though ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""'s portrayal may seem dry and almost documentary-like, it is that style that allows for a greater understanding of what happened and why it happened.",1036713600,12,3314,4.670120898100173
271394,5,6300246876,"I began studying the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor at an early age, as a result of the special fascination the attack held for my grandfather, who's birthday was December 7th. Tora! Tora! Tora! tells the true history of the events leading up to the attack and of the attack itself.
 Looking back across the years and identifying all of the mistakes and intelligence failures on the part of the American Military establishment leaves one incredulous, first and foremost being a gross underestimation of the Japanese military, so much so that radio intercepts which gave clues to the attack were never forwarded to FDR or his staff because it was not believed that the Japanese were capable of the carrying out the attack. There was the Officer on Duty for the new radar station, who responded to news of ""a large formation of planes approaching from the northeast"" with the words ""Yeah? Well, don't worry about it"" because he mistakenly believed the planes were a flight of American B-17's.....the radio station which received a request to broadcast all night so the B-17's could home in on the signal- the Japanese found this to be quite helpful as well.....the officer who insisted on confirmation of the sinking of a Japanese submarine near the harbor entrance because of his fear that it was a false report, until it was too late.....General Short, commander of the US Army stationed at Pearl Harbor, who because of fear of sabotage had all aircraft parked together in the center of the airfields, making them easier to guard but a perfect target for air attack.....the intelligence estimate prepared by General Martin, which stated that ""the Japanese would most likely attack on a Sunday. They would probably employ a maximum of six carriers...""- this estimate was regarded as giving the Japanese ""too much credit"" and not taken seriously.
 The Japanese attack, for all it's success, did not succeed in it's main objective- to destroy American carrier strength. This failure on the part of the Japanese proved to be a boon to the Americans, as it forced US Navy brass to center strategy around the use of carriers rather than battleships. The carrier-battleship debate had raged for years, with conservative Admirals refusing to admit that battleships were obsolete and that carriers were now their most important weapons.
 Anyone who has done serious research on Pearl Harbor will find ALL the major events depicted here. Nothing has been omitted, and nothing has been embellished. Tora! Tora! Tora! is almost a documentary of the attack.
 The cast members do a wonderful job, with Jason Robards as General Short, who would be covered in controversy and shame as a result of the disaster; Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel, who's family spent years trying to clear his name after the attack; James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, who would lead the American carriers to victory over Japan; and Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Stimson, who knew that the US was not ready for war and hoped to buy time by political means. For the Japanese sequences, Soh Yamamura as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, whose brainchild the attack was (complete with missing finger, a wound suffered in the Russo-Japanese War); Tatsuya Mihashi as Commander Genda, brilliant planner of the attack; Takahiro Tamura as Lt. Commander Fuchida, who led the attack; and Eijiro Tono as Admiral Nagumo, the cautious Task Force Commander who broke off the attack even though he knew its main objective had not been met. American sequences were directed by Richard Fleischer and the Japanese by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasuka.
 The cinematogrophy is spectacular, and the visual effects are fantastic, given that Tora! Tora! Tora! was released in 1970. The aerial sequences are well choreographed and shot, and the final scene of the film, Battleship Row smashed and aflame, is stunning.
 Tora! Tora! Tora! should be in the DVD library of anyone who is a fan of war movies or a student of military history.",1036281600,9,3969,4.9788838612368025
271395,3,6300246876,"There's no denying the grand effort that went into making this historical presentation of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Taking accounts of both sides of the war equally, made respectively by both United States and Japanese production crews, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great documentation of how the attack really occurred. Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, which tries to tell the historical story (with many flaws), a love story and a disaster story, Tora! Tora! Tora knows what is meant to be, and strictly follows the historical angle.
Unfortunately, this dedication to fact is the films major weakness. There are no real characterizations of any of the major roles, no central character the audience can connect with, either on the American or Japanese forces. This lack of a so called staring role (which both sides should have had) makes the film feel more like a documentary then a movie. What characters the film does center on are all flat and rather uninteresting. Not to mention poorly acted.
Despite this, the film provides a great understanding of how the attack really occurred, and gives a wonderful visual feast of the disaster. For 1970, when this film was released, the visual effects are outstanding. Definitely worth at least one viewing, more if you're a World War II buff.",1035676800,12,1300,4.967889908256881

One of the best things of this movies are the charactors in the film such as Cordell Hull and Yamamoto. You will feel really sympathatic for these charectors. Best of all they are hardly cliched.

271398,4,6300246876,"There are elements of the movie that left me a little bothered.  Foremost was the subtitles (the Japanese actors speak their own language rather than English) were white which oftentimes appeared with a white background (the navy uniforms).  This was frustrating when trying to really follow the story.  Another element was the constant change of location and players, which made it difficult to keep up with who knew what and when.
In retrospect, these elements contributed to my enjoyment of the film.  Although the scenes of the Pearl Harbor attack were horrific, the bulk of the film concerns the events leading up to that fateful day.  The seemingly haphazardness of this film helped me feel the chaos and miscommunication occurring on both sides of the battlefield.  All the mistakes made by both sides show lessons to be learned; for example, the ignoring of the new radar contact showing a large mass approaching Hawaii, the delay by requesting for confirmation on the sinking of Japanese submarine close to Pearl Harbor, and wish to not alarm the high-ranking officials.
I found this to be a great film, but if you do not have a good idea of who the players and events were at Pearl Harbor in 1941, you may find yourself lost.",1026345600,,1235,4.829383886255924

271422,4,6300246876,"The 2001 blockbuster ""Pearl Harbor"" was more about Hollywood than history, a passionate love-triangle forming an important part of the story-line.  The 1970 flick ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" offers a rather different story of the same event, one devoid of soap opera, romance, blood and gore, but one that is far more true to history.  The account of traditional historians is followed, rather than that of revisionists who claim that President Roosevelt had prior knowledge of the attack but knowingly sacrificed his Pacific fleet as an excuse to enter the war. All the incidents and details are apparently historically documented from ship logs and other records, and the focus on a historically accurate movie is evident from the opening statement which affirms that all events and characters are true to historical fact. Certainly the movie breathes authenticity in every respect.  Remarkably, it presents both sides of the Pearl Harbor tragedy of December 7, 1941: American and Japanese.  To accomplish this, there was a collaboration of two production teams involving American and Japanese film-makers.  And the results are convincing: unlike Hollywood's 2001 ""Pearl Harbor"", the Japanese side is presented accurately and fairly, with even the dialogue in Japanese (with English sub-titles) - the title itself referring to a Japanese word for ""attack!""  If there is any bias, it is present in minimizing Japanese aggression, but most would agree that it the movie gives a fairly accurate picture.  The end result is a documentary-like movie, with the convincing aura of historical fact.
The story of course revolves around the events of the Japanese attack on the US naval fleet in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which led to the United States declaring war on Japan in the Second World War.  The attack featured tactical brilliance and surprise, and was a great success.  In less than two hours, Japanese planes armed with torpedoes sunk or seriously damaged 18 warships, destroyed 188 aircraft and damaged another 159, killed 2,403 and wounded 1,178 American military personnel. Fortunately for the Americans, their aircraft carriers escaped damage only because they were not in Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack.  Japanese losses comprised only 29 planes and pilots, five midget submarines and one large sub with their crews.
The largest part of the movie focuses around the politics and preparation for the attack, and consists mainly of dialogue.  Numerous historical personages play a role, and viewers are given some insight into Japanese-American relations before the attack.  Of particular interest are several scenes featuring Japanese ambassadors and politicians, showing that even amongst the Japanese there were different attitudes towards US-relations.  Alongside hard-liners who advocated aggression, there were also pacifists who truly wanted to strive for a peaceful resolution.  The suspense gradually builds as the foundations are laid for a surprise attack, and as the US ignores the warning signs of impending danger.  The final part of the movie features an extensive and convincing reenactment of the attack itself.  The movie's G rating is somewhat deceiving - while there is no real blood and gore as such (although there are a few rare instances of blasphemy/profanity), viewers are treated to multitudes of spectacular explosions.  There are also some delightful scenes of a dramatic aerial dog fight.  All in all it's a breath-taking and fitting climax, and even by today's standards features pretty impressive cinematography and action.  The exaggerated emotion of Hollywood is absent, but in many ways this enhances the historical record rather than blurs it with sensationalism.
The fact that events are presented more clinically and coldly means of course that Tora! Tora! Tora! lacks the human element that is present in films like 2001's Pearl Harbor, and there is no real sense of what it was like from the perspective of the soldiers.  But by sparing viewers of sensationalized stories of individuals, we get a more overall picture with a real sense of what it was like from the perspective of the military leaders.  It is not so much the story of personal successes and failures, but the failure of the United States military as a whole.  In the process, numerous surprising facts are revealed for those not very familiar with the historical events of the Pearl Harbor tragedy.  Three such facts struck me: Firstly, the fact that the success of the Japanese was due in part to a comedy of errors by US intelligence in failing to properly anticipate the oncoming attack, and that the US navy was unprepared and defenseless largely through its own fault.  Secondly, the fact that the Japanese showed restraint by deciding not to launch as many waves of attack as initially planned. Thirdly, the fact that rather than revel in victory, the Japanese commander-in-chief was most displeased that the carefully planned timing went wrong (Washington received the planned ultimatum an hour after the attack rather than half an hour beforehand), because he realized that it would just infuriate the United States all the more: ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""
If you want be wowed by Hollywood's fancy special effects, horrified by Hollywood's blood and gore, and cry over Hollywood's romantic soap opera, go watch 2001's ""Pearl Harbor"".  But for those who want a tribute to history's real story, you need look no further than 1970's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""  If there are weaknesses, it might be that the acting is not always convincing, and that this is a story that is so objective and filtered of bias that it lacks the human element.  But soap opera doesn't have to be present to make an movie enthralling - the suspense and the chronicle of real events is enthralling in itself, and the final action scenes of the air attack are remarkably real and heart-stopping.  And all the more powerful because they reflect history.  For most of us, history is to be preferred over Hollywood any day.",1023753600,12,6084,5.129554655870446
271423,5,6300246876,"This movie does an excellent job of telling the story of the Pearl Harbor attack itself, but what I enjoyed the most about it was how the events leading up to the attack itself were given equal coverage as well.  I enjoyed watching the scenes of Colonel Bratton (E.G. Marshall) and Commander Kramer reading the ""Magic"" intercepts, as well as the leaders in Washington dealing with Kurusu and Nomura.  Martin Balsam and Jason Robards give excellent performances as Admiral Kimmel and General Short.  The attack footage itself is well-done also.  I've owned this video for several years, and I watch it about every six weeks.  I prefer this movie to ""Pearl Harbor"".  While the special effects of ""Pearl Harbor"" are superior, Tora! Tora! Tora! does a much better job of incorporating the diplomatic aspect of the attack as well as the attack itself.

271424,5,6300246876,"Unfortunately, many people look to the 2001 release of ""Pearl Harbor"" to see what happened at Pearl. With ""Pearl Harbor"" you're getting an over-stuffed and over-rated film about a love story - and - oh, yeah - some Pacific Fleet getting blown up by the Japanese. It is a disgrace to even be in comparison with Mausda and Fleischer's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"". Everything but the special effects are better in this 1970 film than the other one release thirty years later.
""Tora!"" documents and commemorates the coming time before the attack, giving you very respected points of view from both the Japanese and American views. It's here that you can see just how smart the Japanese were in a painstaking attack of Pearl. You can also see the subtle buildup and how really unprepared we were for such an attack. Such things as why the fighters were lined up and the radar crew were put down by HQ are told in the film, as well as an extrodinary battle scene suprising for the time and technology they had in 1970.
""Tora!"" lacks a central character. If the film had one, perhaps it would recieve more Academy Awards. (Remember, ""Patton"" was also released the same year and shut out ""Tora!""). Still, a strong performance by So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto strengthens the film, and easy and historic sequence makes the film flow and become one of the best war films ever made.",1019865600,5,1365,4.668049792531121

It doesn't waste time on sub-plots, or on cheesy love stories - rather it properly gets to the events of that fateful event in history, and retells them in the proper way, with respect for both sides and for the soldiers involved.
Granted the battle itself was not as nearly impressive as the 40+ min show of FX in ""Pearl Harbor"", but for the time period that this film was made in, it was impressive indeed. This movie, unlike ""Pearl Harbor"", had a coherent idea of what it was gonna be - a war movie - not an overpriced, over Fx'd, muddled story with the events of 12/7/1941 as a backdrop. This movie respects the history of the events of that fateful day.

271427,5,6300246876,"What makes this movie so good is the cooperation between both sides. The movie was done by two separater groups, with directors, camera crews, and actors in both America and Japan. It was created as a joint effort from both countries. They did a great job putting it together. As the scenes change, you go from the commanders on the Japanese ships preparing for the attack, to the unprepared, Americans. My favorite line in the movie, basically sums up the U.S.'s readiness of the event. The men watching the radar ask how they should report anything odd that turns up on the radar, and the commander responds that there is a gas station about a mile down the road. ""They must have a phone.""
The best part of the movie is the battle. It lasts a good half hour, with special effects that rival ""Pearl Harbor,"" although the budget for ""Tora! Tora! Tora! was much smaller, and it's older. The special effects are amazing, and it almost feels like you are at the battle.

Since the first time that I saw Tora Tora Tora, I have always been fascinated by the degree of knowledge that the members of the military community in Washington D.C. had of the ""Surprise"" attack by The Japanese Empire.

It is a very good movie of epic proportions, featuring a large assembly of vintage aircraft, and the production filmed on location at Oahu. There's no love story, the operation itself and historic events leading to the attack are the main features.  Most interesting is the movie comprised of two productions, a collaboration between American and Japanese directors to achieve an accurate depiction of the event that brought America into World War II. The portrayal of Admiral Yamamoto's profound remark about awakening a ""Sleeping Giant"" at the end of the movie has a much higher impact than the more recent scene in ""Pearl Harbor.""

This movie was an American/Japanese collaboration with the Americans directing their side with English speaking actors and a Japanese director handling the all Japanese speaking cast.  Extremely well done, if you ask me. Even though the viewer knows what's going to happen, they still manage to build up the drama.  The thing that really got me was how well the apathy in the U.S. military was portrayed.  The attitudes, disorganization, and lack of discipline really hit home.  General Short and Admiral Kimmel were portrayed exactly as I had always imagined them, incompetent buffoons.

execution of the most brilliant wartime raid ever made.  It also shows an arrogant and somewhat disbelieving American view of the
Japanese threat on the Hawaiian islands prior to our involvement in World War Two.  It is one of the best war movies ever made.

I had thought that perhaps my memory had been kind to the film, but it was just as spectacular as I recalled, and more surprisingly, I found the commentary track on this DVD to be excellent.

But with the recent release of Pearl Harbor, I decided to give this movie another viewing. While it does not have today's computer-generated graphics, it is a very accurate, entertaining and important movie about the Pearl Harbor attack.
Unlike the recent Pearl Harbor film, which seems to have been made only to make money (Which it unfortunately did), Tora! Tora! Tora! was made to teach us about the attack and why it happened. Also, comparing Pearl Harbor's war scenes with those in Tora! Tora! Tora! is like the difference between night and day. Most of Tora! Tora! Tora! is live action and model work. They are excellently choreographed and filmed. Those in Pearl Harbor were simply made on a computer and are laughable compared with the still impressive live action work of this movie.
Tora! Tora! Tora! tells in detail why the Japanese chose to bomb Pearl Harbor. Many people ask as to why the U.S was unprepared for attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S assumed that no one would ever attack and that sabotage was a bigger threat. Plus, Admiral Yamamoto was pressured into planning the attack by the high command, who might have been pressured because they had recently signed an alliance with Germany.
There are some extra features included on this tape. A commercial advertisement for The Sand Pebbles, Von Ryan's Express and Twelve O'Clock High and the Theatrical Trailer for Tora! Tora! Tora! are before the presentation. After the movie is a twenty-minute documentary, which includes interviews with historians, authors and teachers about the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a well made extra and informative but I'll take National Geographic's Pearl Harbor: Legacy of Attack over it any day.
Overall, Tora! Tora! Tora! is the best feature-length film made so far about the attack on Pearl Harbor and is one of the best war movies ever made.",1002844800,5,1939,4.861027190332326
271452,5,6300246876,"A unique collaboration between American and Japanese filmmakers, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" remains the definitive Hollywood portrayal of the tragic events of December 7, 1941. Perhaps the greatest compliment ever paid to this film was provided by none other than Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, the ""masterminds"" behind the disastrous ""Pearl Harbor"", who stated that ""Tora"" played too much like a documentary. Well, how about that? No meandering love story, no Hallmark script, just cold, hard facts. ""Tora"" places us smack dab in the middle of a lethal chess game played by politicians in Washington and Tokyo throughout the Fall of '41. The political stalemates and blunders which inevitably lead to war are the meat and potatoes of ""Tora"". The climax is, of course, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which is masterfully and accurately re-created. Vintage airplanes and actual ships are seemlessly juxtaposed with miniature models. The results are a spectacular cinematic experience which still holds up by today's standards. (Digital effects didn't exist when ""Tora"" was released in 1970.) Several big names-- Joseph Cotten, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall -- assume starring roles, yet wisely let the story be the ""star"" of the film. Credit the filmmakers for steering the focus toward the ""event"" without getting sidetracked in typical Hollywood fashion. To objectively portray the events of Pearl Harbor through the eyes of both sides, while keeping finger-pointing to a minimum, was no small task. In turn, the ability of the viewer to experience the preparation and strategy of both sides makes ""Tora"" truly unique.

What is amazing is how well it holds up, and without tons of gore or dozens of explatives. It seems that this is the new stuff of war films, but Tora...(if I keep typing this in I will seriously go crazy) is a slice of old-time filmmaking. Instead of being one-sided, this movie tells its story from both sides. The Japanese are not portrayed as war-mongering hawks, on the contrary, both the Emperor and Yamamoto are portrayed as doves. It is the ""army hotheads"" they both despise that are the hawks. When war appears eminent, Yamamoto knows what he must do. What makes this movie great is the what if..? scenarios. What if they hadn't been blocked from putting the radar on the mountain in Pearl? What if the intelligence officer had predicted Sunday December 7 intead of Sunday, November 30?

Tora!' is an interesting American film because it took account of both sides' perspective of the war, and its portrayal of the internal Japanese politics that led up to the attack was quite detailed for a Hollywood film.  You can almost bet that film of this calibre would not have been made in Hollywood today - too many marketing agents would be demanding changes to make it more palatable to the mass audience.  I first saw this film when I was a kid, and recently I saw this film again long after my graduation from university education as a history honours graduate.  I came to appreciate how much I missed when I first saw it as a kid.  That speaks loudly for the depth of this film.
I now appreciate how reluctant the Japanese navy chiefs were about entering into a war with the Americans, and their disagreement with Tojo, who was portrayed in this film as an ultra-nationalist warmonger.  It reminds of another debate that took place between the Japanese navy and army over the question of whether they should invade Australia.  The navy argued that it should be invaded because the strategic value of Darwin as a naval base, while the army argued against it because of the logistic difficulty in defending a large country with their over stretched manpower.  It makes me appreciate the dominance of the Japanese army generals in the decision making process of war time Japan.
'Tora!...' is also very emphathetic and detailed in its portrayal of the American perspective, especially the political intercourse between the military inteligence, military administration, diplomatic service and the presidential office.  It has probably missed other key historical details as well (such as the role of foreign allied intelligence), but for a film of this magnitude, you can be forgiving.
Finally there's enough action in this film to satisfy the hormonal instinct in us all, though that comes in the latter part of the film.  In fact 'Pearl Harbor' took some footages from 'Tora!...', which is a tribute to the quality of action footages in 'Tora!...'

In fact, I made them see the film and the reaction was extremely mixed.  Some of them prefered the romantic approach that ""Pearl Harbor"" was presenting, especially girls.  But, what the hell...?
""Tora! Tora!

The only thing that kept me from falling asleep was the Japanese sequences involving the plans of attack, and some funny sequences involving oneliners. I also didn't quite agree with their portrayal of Dorie Miller, the mess attendant who shot down two Japanese airplanes, and won the first naval cross for an African-American. The character was only given about ten seconds of film time. I was very upset. The portrayal in PEARL HARBOR was 100% better, given that the role was given to a great actor, Cuba Gooding, Jr. I was also very dissapointed with the way they ended the film. It was too depressing.

271481,5,6300246876,"...rest assured that this 30 year old classic TORA! TORA! TORA! will not disappoint. This is a carefully researched, historically accurate, well acted, thoughtful movie. In other words it appropriately honors the event and treats it with respect. The movie provides sufficient background and builds up to the actual attack. The development of the plan is shown to be the work of some brilliant stategists and is a result of Japan's appreciation for the capabilities of naval air power. The diplomatic and intelligence activities that factored so significantly in the outcome are given due consideration.
The movie does not tackle any of the controversies that have swirled around the event, almost since the day after. The elements that are key ingedients of the conspiracy theories such as intelligence information, aircraft dispersal at Wheeler field, the radar installation and decisions of commanders such as Admiral Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short are shown in a dispassionate and objective light. As a result, coincidence, oversight, and simple error are shown to be at fault, and more importantly, shown to be more believable than the alternative - a vast conspiracy of falsehoods and willingness to sacrifice men in order to get us into the war.
The action scenes showing the attack on Pearl are well done and are preceeded by a good build up of the suspense. The limited special effects capabilities of the time takes nothing away from the enjoyment of the action. No whizz-bang special effects are needed. The movie concludes with Adm. Yamamoto realizing that by failing to sink the American aircraft carriers this was a pyrrhic victory. He acknowledges as much with his famous quote: ""We have aroused a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve."" Good acting by So Yamamura as Adm. Yamamoto, Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Martin Balsam as Adm. Kimmel, Ejiro Tono as Adm. Nagumo and Takahiro Tamura as Lt. Commander Fuchida",993513600,4,1961,5.11214953271028
271482,5,6300246876,"This film is about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December of 1941.  It is not about anything else - there is no love story!  It is told from the perspective of the leaders of both sides, including the PM of Japan, the military leaders (Marshall, Yamamoto, etc.), and the senior diplomats (including the US embassy in Tokyo, and the Japanese in Washington).  The first 80-90 minutes tells of the lead-up to the battle, showing Japanese pilots practising, diplomatic/political meetings, setting up radar stations in Hawaii, etc.  The final 40-50 minutes is a recreation of the battle.  Of significance is the attention to detail.  The uniforms, ships, and planes all look very nice.  In addition (as the director's commentary points out), all the events depicted in the movie are well documented as having really happened, from eyewitness reports, ships' logs, etc.
The most impressive part is, of course, the battle itself.  It looks amazing!  Especially when compared with modern movies ; why don't computer effects obey the laws of physics?  Bombs do not fall straight down, they follow parabolic tragectories.  Because all the effects are ""real"" in this movie (i.e. full-scale models), the battle has a sense of realism that modern movies do not duplicate.  Further, there are frequent cuts to dumbfounded officers watching the carnage, which, instead of slowing the action down, make the action scenes more poignant.
Modern movies have a disturbing tendency to gloss over (or change outright) facts for the purposes of the story.  Here, everything is in context - WWII did not start with this event, which other movies often imply by ignoring the broader picture.  A second modern tendency is to tell the story from a swabby's or PFC's perspective, which will necessarily limit the character's scope of knowledge.  Instead, Tora, Tora, Tora tells all from the brass and civilian leaders' perspective, so you get more of the subtlties.  Finally, showing both the Japanese and US perspective makes for a much better look at this battle.
The DVD extras are not great, but the director's commentary (also featuring a Japanese film historian) has some interesting tidbits.  For anyone unfamiliar with the battle, the 20 minute documentary will be helpful, although the identities of the men interviewed are not released, which gives it an air of amaturism.  Incidentally, the name ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" comes from the code word signalled by the Japanese pilots to indicate that complete surprise was achieved in the attack.",993427200,11,2528,5.139364303178484

Is Pearl Harbor really the appropriate historical event to detail a mushy, who cares romance?  The film makers here knew it was not.  They adhered to the tension and the events that led up to the declaration/misinformation of war due to the decreased technological advances of communication of the time.  This is an important lesson and it shows how War is definitely a problem of communication more than anything else.

271484,5,6300246876,"The movie, in its original form, was a masterpiece.  As a person growing up not 30 minutes from Pearl, and whose house overlooks the West Lock, its history and legacy is always a part of me.  ""Tora Tora Tora"" takes its que from the grand film making that was produced by Hollywood during the war but it adds an abstract that makes it truly unique for its time: It was joint produced.  Most of the war movies,(Red Sands, Go For Broke, Thirty Seconds..) all had American perspectives and never really explained the notion of what the opposite side viewed the US.  Even today, the notion of a joint production is hardly used.(As was shown in the debaucle known as ""Pearl Harbor"".)
Tora Tora Tora maintains its historical accuracy in that it pieces together, step by step, what happened from BOTH sides, of the conflict.  You see the planning and the strategy of the Japanese forces as they practice-bomb targets in Kagoshima and Etorofu, how the conflict within the High Command eventually lead up to the war that was AGAINST the will of Hirohito,(he was left out of the loop on top information until it was too late.)  You also see the arrogance of the US Military and how the White People looked down upon the AJA Population in Hawaii simply because they were of Japanese origin.
For anything, the acting and the effects, for its time, was stunning and still remain something to emulate, which ""Pearl Harbor""(2001), has failed on most accounts.  The special features don't really add to the value but the movie alone is enough reason to buy.",992649600,3,1540,4.681481481481481

271487,5,6300246876,"1970's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" should have done much better at the box-office on its release. If remembered at all it is noted for its realistic special visual effects of the Pearl Harbor attack. Long forgotten are the performances of the principal actors and the well-constructed screenplay and editing. This is truly a shame because it is one of the most historically accurate film depictions of any World War II event. Accuracy can always be debated considering film length, budget and scripting. On a relative basis to the hundreds of war films produced this is one of the more accurate. The film is really an in-depth analysis of events leading up to and culminating in the unprovoked actual Japanese attack. These events are shown from both sides with Richard Fleischer directing the American sequences and Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku directing the Japanese. What is amazing is just how well these events create true suspense and tension throughout. This is achieved through skillful editing from James E. Newcom, Pembroke J. Herring and Inoue Chikaya from the well-written and researched screenplay by Larry Forrester, Hideo Oguni and Ryuzo Kikushima. The Special Effects are undeniably the best ever produced for a War film made during the 20th century. They combine both close-ups and panoramic views, which give the real scope of the devastation. On the acting front James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey impressed me the most. He seemed like the one high ranking American officer with a good head on his shoulders, decisive and no procrastinator. Also good were Neville Brand as Lt. Kaminsky (up to his neck in bureaucratic procrastination) and George Macready as Cordell Hull. Macready showed restrained outrage and disgust at the document handed him by Japanese Ambassador Nomura (Shogo Shimada). I thought that all the actors portraying Japanese Naval officers were excellent. Once again composer Jerry Goldsmith demonstrates his brilliance as a composer as he calls upon both American and Oriental motifs to tell this drama from both perspectives. Goldsmith brilliantly captures the underlying mood of the Japanese Naval leaders on one side and the perplexed and frustrated United States Naval and Army Intelligence officers on the other. This film brilliantly depicts the greatest act of modern era cowardice perpetuated from one nation upon another in peacetime. For a country that prided itself on the concept of `honor' this film demonstrates just how dishonorable and cowardly a nation can become under the imperial ambitions of its leaders. As the film reiterates at its conclusion, one man from that country realized that they had awakened a sleeping dragon. This is truly great filmmaking. It also starred Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, Soh Yamamura, E.G. Marshall, Takahiro Tamura, Eijiro Tono, Leon Ames, Richard Anderson, Edward Andrews and G.D. Spradlin.

271532,5,6300246876,"Although I haven't seen the new film with Ben Afflek I am am sure that it will be entertaining as a story, but nowhere near the truth that this film is.  I found it singularly ironic that Jason Robards, who played General Short, was a radio signalman on a ship in the harbor at the time of the attack.  In narrating one documentary on the attack which was shown on PBS, he remembers decoding the message, ""Air Raid Peral Harbor.  This is no Drill!""
While I am not going to visit the controversay surrounding the attack and the various conspiracy theories that abound, it is clear that Admrial Yamamoto is clearly portrayed.  A tragic figure in history, somewhat like Gen Robert E. Lee, he went into battle reluctantly and did his best for a cause he knew would be lost.  He spent the 30's stalked by assasins from the Army, and when the Japanese Army took the government, he was willing to go to war with the Army.  I find myself wondering how history would have changed if that had happened.  For an interesting read I would recommend ""The Reluctant Admiral : Yamamoto and the Imperial Navy"" by Hiroyuki Agawa, also available from Amazon.
However, the video accurately portrays the events surrounding the battle.  Historically, the Americans felt that the war would begin with a battleship conflict and an aerial attack in the Phillipines.  From E. G. Marshall's portrayal of Col Bratten, to Martin Balasm's portrayal of Admrial Kimmel, the program displays almost the commedy of errors that led to American forces being so unready that they didn't have a single plane in the air at the time of the attack.  The effects are spactular, given the technology of the time, and unlike the contemporary film, portray ships that did appear in the battle.  Truely appreciate this truthful portrayal of the begining of the end of America's complacency .",991872000,4,1845,4.752351097178684

271535,4,6300246876,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" has been re-released on VHS and DVD to capitalize on the opening of Michael Bay's newest film treatment of the events of December 7th, 1941. This leaves it wide open for comparisons to ""Pearl Harbor,"" while also showing the vast contrasts of the movie-making and storytelling techniques of the past and the present. I'm not too keen on war movies, at least not the ones long ago which seem to be made for war veterans alone, but this one is not that bad. It is a bit tedious at times, but not a failure.
The movie sticks solely with historical events, choosing to keep any ficticious plotlines for another film. It's a joint collaboration between the American and Japanese filmmakers in order to get everything just right in terms of accuracy, and it succeeds. The Japanese are shown making the plans to attack the United States where they are most vulnerable, while also keeping US government officials at bay with talks of negotiation and peace. It wastes no time in letting us know that Pearl Harbor is the place for the attack, and from that point on, the Japanese make their unsighted journey across the Pacific for the legendary ""day of infamy.""
On the opposite side of the Pacific, the United States is constantly in a frenzy, as we cross-cut between scenes at Pearl Harbor before the attack and Washington D.C., where various government officials run frantically around trying the decode Japanese messages intercepted on machinery that makes today's desktop computers look like pocket calculators. Once they start realizing that Japan is up to something, they take their findings, from translated messages to their own theories, to those in charge of making commands.
Of course, no one believes until it is too late that something could be brewing in the Pacific. As the Japanese close in, things begin to get faster as planes take off from carriers and the first intercepts of Honolulu radio are heard in their cockpits. The bombs start exploding, the ships start burning, and everyone comes to realize just what a mistake they made in not listening to the warnings.
Now, everyone has been comparing the way in which ""Pearl Harbor"" was concocted to the creation of ""Titanic;"" this is in terms of movie-making. In terms of what actually happened historically, the story of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" can also be compared to the Titanic tragedy. The Titanic sank because warnings of ice and dangerous seas were ignored repeatedly. It's the same case with the Pearl Harbor bombing: American officials chose to wave off the signs as mere fiction or coincidence (at one point, as the Japanese planes are flying towards Hawaii, one official shrugs them off as B-17 planes flying in from training). And just as the sinking of the Titanic was a great tragedy for many, so was the devastation of Pearl Harbor, which led American to declare war on Japan.
The attack portion of this movie does leave a bit to be desired, and perhaps this is because I'm a child of the technological era, where special effects do a lot of storytelling these days. This sequence, when put into the same arena as the effects-driven attack portion of ""Pearl Harbor,"" pales in comparison. ""Tora!"" is mostly comprised of aerial shots of the attack, and the effects are really cheesy, just what you'd expect from a war movie of the past. ""Pearl"" has more technology to toy with, and certainly makes good use of it, pumping the scenes full of adrenaline and pulse-pounding action to blow you away.
But still, ""Tora!"" wins over. The history involved in its unfolding of events is superb, even if a bit long. It brings out the inevitable comparisons to the latest Pearl Harbor treatment, while also making itself known as a landmark historical film.",991440000,11,3733,4.843505477308295
271536,4,6300246876,"Tora! Tora! Tora is a very well-done movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While some events are not historically correct, and some roles and events could have been expanded, the movie overall is very good.
The movie does a good job of portraying the events prior to the attack, although it sometimes leaves the timing of events to the imagination. Some events occuring in quick succession in the movie actually occured over a fairly long period of time.
The attack scenes were well-done and fairly accurate. The special effects were done quite well, considering the technology available at the time. I would have preferred to have seen more story lines about individual acts of heroism, of which there were many, but that should not be considered a criticism.
Martin Balsam is superb in his role as Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Jason Robards, Jr., comes off a little stuffy, but otherwise believeable, in his role as General Walter Short, commander of Army forces in Hawaii.

What has always amazed me with this movie, is the fairness and historical accuracy used in its creation.  The movie's beginning says it has attempted to be historically accurate- which I agree with.  I realize there's a great many people out there who believe FDR ""knew"" the attack was coming, but I for one, agree with the movie in showing that he did not.  The movie is very good at showing the chaos going on in military Japan, and without going into excruciating detail, depicts the upheavel and in-house fighting going on within the country.  Besides the accuracy, I really like the action scences- the flights of planes, and the ships in the harbor do not look like little toy models or anything along those lines.

I am writing this on the weekend of the release of the big Disney movie, Pearl Harbor, which I have not seen yet (I intend to after the crowds subside).  After having invited some friends over for a weekend BBQ, I suggested we watch my new DVD from Amazon, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and I started the movie half way through, choosing the scene after the film's intermission, basically so we could get right to the battle scenes, since we were mostly a bunch of guys filled with charred meat and beer expecting some action oriented entertainment.  Realizing this was a movie made before I was born, we expected the special effects would be rudimentary, while at the same time appreciated the lack of computer animation.  When those Zero planes buzzed over the harbor, with the torpedoes exploding, the ships on fire, and the airfields bursting into fireballs, we were all screaming with glee and approval.
It's a great war flick, with plenty to soak in.  Of course, the reality of the historical attack and the American tragedy was part of the awe, but so was the grand scale of the explosive film production (watching the stunt men literally run for their lives from flaming airplanes props which went unexpectedly out of control during filming), as well as the visual experience of a sustained, surprise air raid with hundreds of enemy planes buzzing around.

271572,5,6300246876,"Tora Tora Tora was produced in 1970, when technology was less sophisticated than it is today.  But this is no ordinary war film. It attempts to show both the Japanese and the American sides, which is no easy task.  It surprised me how well it succeeded though and, even though some of the dialog seemed awkward in its scripting, I realize it was necessary to help the audience understand some of the complexities of the politics of the time.  There were both Japanese and American directors and writers working on this film and the results are thought provoking.  The Japanese sections are in Japanese, of course, and even though the captions are difficult to read on my small TV, the acting, the history and the Japanese view of fighting with honor kept my eyes glued to the screen.  The Americans, in contrast, look like blunderers, making one tactical mistake after another.  But then again, this kind of thing is always easy to see in retrospect.
The cast was huge, with 20 or more major leads.  I was not acquainted with the Japanese actors, but the American cast included Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotton, E.G. Marshall and Jason Robards.  The writers obviously tried to stick closely to historical facts, and there were no central leading characters with inflated roles.  There was also no manufactured back story of individuals caught up in the drama.  And, as the names of both the American and the Japanese generals and politicians were not familiar to me, it was a bit difficult to follow the personalities.  However, there was no problem at all following the movement of the plot.  And, in spite of knowing the eventual outcome, I found myself riveted to the screen.
Nominated for five academy awards, mostly for technical achievements, Tora Tora Tora was not a financial success in its time.  I understand that Midway and Mash came out that year and I don't know if audiences were ready to look at the battle from the Japanese point of view.  Although this film did not get into individual stories, we could sense some of the conflicting emotional states that some of the Japanese officers felt during those stress-filled days leading up to the attack.  And we could see the frustration of some of the American officers who believed the attack was coming and who tried to warn their superiors who didn't believe them.

Let me say right at the outset that I consider this one of the best war films ever made.  Certainly, it has its weaknesses -- there is not the kind of character development you find in a dramatic film such as From Here to Eternity.  Tora Tora Tora is essentially a documentary film, and in that vein it is practically unsurpassed.  The technical accuracy is incredible, especially for a film from the days before computer-generated effects.  Unlike Pearl Harbor, which attempts to pass off Vietnam-era ships as WWII vintage (promotional shots for the movie show the frigate USS Whipple, commissioned in 1971, being bombed by the Japanese in 1941), the ships in Tora Tora Tora accurately depict the ships that were involved in the attack.  They might be miniatures, but at least they're accurate miniatures!  And although the Japanese planes are not authentic -- I believe there are only two authentic Zeros still flying in the world today -- the reproduction planes used in the movie are so convincing that they're still being used in vintage airshows today.  The sets -- including a full-size mock-up of the Japanese battleship Nagato -- are beautifully executed.  And the action sequences are wrenchingly poignant.
Part of the enduring appeal of this movie is its balance in depicting very politically sensitive events.  Japanese and American movie makers collaborated on the movie, and as a result the Japanese who participated in the attack are neither glorified nor villified -- just men caught in a momentous historical moment, some enthusiastically and some reluctantly.  Nonetheless, the full infamy of the attack is impressed on the viewer.  Far better to directly and straight-forwardly address these critical aspects of the attack than to avoid or ignore them, which is what I fear may be the case in Pearl Harbor.",990748800,17,2002,4.978978978978979

271577,5,6300246876,"Excellent and well made film with incredible stunts and special effects. It's amazing no stuntmen were killed on the set (although two died during rehearsal prior to filming).  Made in 1970 as a joint Japanese/American production at a cost between 25 and 30 million dollars . Every scene is meticulously re-created from historical records, including most of the dialogue. The attack was  filmed before the advent of computer animation, which makes it even more amazing. This dvd was re-released with  the director's commentary which is very boring and prodding, with very little insight into the making of  the film and ignores commentary scene by scene. You'd think they weren't even watching the film!  I bought this re-release (already had the original dvd with no special features) for the commentary and was extremely dissappointed.(I hate it when dvd's are re-released with new special features!) I guess they penalize the diehards by making us buy the dvd over and over again. Regardless, this is the BEST film ever made about Pearl Harbor. No mention of a Roosevelt conspiracy - (as it should be, since the conspiracy theory has major flaws) and no, I'm not a Roosevelt lover or hater.

271579,5,6300246876,"I'm not a big war-movie buff any more (THE SEARCH FOR PRIVATE RYAN cured me) but this is a worthwhile film if you have an interest in WWII. TORA! TORA! TORA! is a documentary-type film.  Think of it as a Stephen Ambrose book recorded live. The film is neither a glorified fifties war-film (IN HARMS WAY, BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA), nor is it a Viet Nam noir-war film (PLATOON, THE DEER HUNTER). (Neither of which are particularly authentic.)
TORA! TORA! TORA! recreates war from the perspective of news correspondent-participant-observer. The story is presented from both the Japanese and American viewpoints and it is presented like a History Channel film.
It took the film crew several months to film TORA! TORA! TORA!  I was living in Navy housing on Pearl Harbor at the time and a number of our friends and acquaintences found part-time jobs acting in the film. ""Real"" military pilots in-between rounds in Viet Nam flew some of the planes (this was 1969).
Much of the architecture in Honolulu was vintage WWII era or earlier and the rest of the island was relatively unchanged from the 1940s. The terrain looked very much as it had when my father-in-law passed through on his way to Guadalcanel and later Iwo Jima.
I cannot tell you the names of the aircraft (my husband could) but I was told that they used real aircraft from the period including the P40s the U.S. flew and the captured Zeros the Japanese flew. We drove up to Schoffield Barracks to look at the old airplanes lined up row on row. During the filming, one of these old planes crashed in a sugar cane field and burned up before the pilot could be rescued. The daily flights overhead, the real crashes, the reenactment of the destruction in the harbor, the daily flights in and out of Hickam as men and material destined for Viet Nam left and wounded and dead arrived--was all very weird.
Well, this is an excellent film.  The new PEARL HARBOR relies on all sorts of technology, but if you want to see how Hawaii really looked in 1941 and how the planes really looked, and how the crews really looked, and obtain some sense of how terrifying it was to be in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 this is the film to see.",989107200,358,2181,4.558673469387755
271580,5,6300246876,"What a bonus.  I was able to get this film as part of a World War II DVD package.
Released in 1970, the film remains comparable to more recent World War II epics.
The producers succeed in dramatizing the historical events leading to the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, an event that remains a day of infamy and controversy into the 21st century.
While the Japanese sequences are especially well-done, except for Japanese pilots who may be seem as stereotypes from a John Wayne movie of the 1940's.
The blundering Americans depicted in the film make me a bit uncomfortable. It's difficult to believe so many people made so many mistakes, considering the political developments in the Far East and Europe during the 1930's.
It's a shame that producers didn't make a companion documentary, ""The Making of Tora...""  It would be very educational to see how the explosions, etc. were shot.
""Tora, Tora, Tora"" is another good film for World War II buffs, and a good teaching tool for junior/senior high school students -- especially for recuctant learners.

I refer to, of course, the final attack on Pearl Harbor during the last 30 minutes of the film. The oscar winning special effects are among the finest ever seen in any movie in the history of Hollywood. The Japanese sequences depicting the events leading up to the attack are well directed and acted, while the US seqences depicting an ingnorant American staff of officers ""I want confirmation"", "" ...well...don't worry about it"", ""sir, may I recommend you telephone Admiral Kimmel in Hawiai""-""no....I'd better phone the President first...now if you all would please exuse me"" and other such dialogue provides a stark contrast to the Japanese segments. All in all, this DVD is not to be missed by anyone, American, Japanese or any other nationality who has any interest at all in WWII.",978220800,6,879,4.945945945945946
271592,4,6300246876,"""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor as told from both the American and Japanese sides in almost a documentary style.  The American segments were directed by Richard Fleischer while Kinji Fukasaku ended up replacing Akira Kurosawa for the Japanese segments.  Both sides of the story are played out not so much by an all-star cast as a collection of some of these best character actors on both side of the Pacific: Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jason Robards on the one hand, Soh Yamamura, Tatsuya Mihashi and Takahino Tamura on the other.  The counter-point between the two sides of the story is quite effective, with the careful planning, preparation and execution of the attack by the Japanese contrasted with the chain of fatal mistakes made by the Americans.  As a historical primer on the attack the film covers all of the excruciatingly painful details, from the radar operators dismissing the large incoming blip on their screens to General Marshall out riding his horse at the absolutely worst time, from a stubborn insistence upon ""confirmation"" of submarine sightings to the fumbling typist in the Japanese embassy trying frantically to complete his final message that must be delivered before the attack begins.  E. G. Marshall as Colonel Rufus G. Bratton gets the Cassandra role in this film, the intelligence officer convinced there is going to be an attack but who cannot get anyone to listen to him until it is too late.  However, the film is so balanced in its presentation that you cannot help but feel for Ambassador Nomura, who misses the deadline and must still deliver the fatal letter to Secretary of State Cordell Hull.  ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" certainly achieved its goal of being a film that could be played in both countries without complaints from either side.  I find it hard to believe that the upcoming theatrical release of ""Pearl Harbor"" would even come close to this standard.
  This is the first film to focus primarily on the Pearl Harbor attack, with previous efforts using the battle as the start (""In Harm's Way"") or the end (""From Here to Eternity"") of a more personal journey.  ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" somewhat disproves the old adage, because not only does it show the ""many fathers of success"" on the Japanese side, it quite clearly refutes the idea ""failure is an orphan"" by laying the blame clearly on their American military counterparts.  This is by no means a controversial telling of the tale, so you will not find anything suggesting FDR knew about the attack and allowed it to make Americans angry enough to go to war.  This is a film purporting to show ""what really happened"" and leaves notions of heroism up to the audience.  In keeping with this approach, the importance of this particular moment in history is underscored not by angry Americans shouting ""Remember Pearl Harbor!' but by Admiral Yamamoto's understatement: ""I fear all we have down is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""
Final note:  Several stunt people were killed during the filming of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!,"" and it is difficult to watch some of the stunts involving planes crashing into each other without wondering if what you are seeing is one of the stunts from which someone did not walk away.  This is ironically appropriate given the film's subject matter.",976147200,20,3330,4.88809946714032
271593,5,6300246876,"I first saw this film many years ago when it was a movie of the week on network TV.  Like any kid, I was interested in the battle scenes, and by the time I'd graduated with a Communications degree, I dismissed this movie out of hand as a faithful, but unexceptional telling of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.
Mea Culpa!!  I finally saw this film in widescreen format, and this movie's artistic value magnified ten-fold.  The idea for this film was inspired: an American director would shoot the American scenes telling the USA side of the battle, and a Japanese director would tell the Japanese side of the story.  Originally the legendary Akira Kurasowa was hired to direct the Japanese side of the story, but after a falling out, Toshio Masuda ended up directing the Japanese side of the film.  Richard Fleischer directed the American sequences.
Fleischer does a fine job, but Masuda is absolutely brilliant.  The Japanese side of the story is the more compelling side of the story, but Masuda truly does a masterful job of setting forth scenes of eloquence and power in telling the story of highly motivated people whose actions will doom their country.
Despite truth being stranger than fiction, Hollywood all too often needlessly flushes historical truth down the toilet (""JFK"" anyone?).  Fortunately, this powerful story is meticulous in its historical accuracy.  With a compelling muscial score and great special effects, especially considering the age of this film, this is a film which should appeal to movie lovers and history buffs both.
IMPORTANT!! This is a film which can ONLY be appreciated in widescreen/DVD format.  The dogfight sequences, the impressive sets and much of the drama is lost in the version formatted for TV, resulting in the butchering of a masterpiece.",976060800,37,1781,4.96969696969697
271594,5,6300246876,The movie ia a truly remarkable work. It allows us to see the viewpoints of both the Americans and Japanese with a high degree of historical  accuracy. Its good to see all the military blunders and various levels of  incompentence by both politicians and military officials in the film. I say  this because in a number of World War II films we are only allowed to see  the Axis powers behave like bumbling idiots.

271595,2,6300246876,"The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor seems to be accurate, as to time, and place, and naval/military deployments. However, the screen writers have gone out of their way to depict Americans as either stupid, ignorant, or  unconcerned. While on the other hand, the Japanese enemy is depicted as  polite, wise, and opposed to war, and the number of American casualties  seems of little importance.
It is apparent that the dialog was written in  Tokyo; and it surely could have been the product of General Tojo's war-time  propaganda machine.
Yashida and Yamamoto, et al., say things like:  1- ""We have awakened a sleeping giant.""  2- ""I've  lived in Washington and studied at Harvard, so I  know the  Americans are a proud and just people.""  3- ""If war becomes  inevitable America would be the most  formidible foe we ever  fought."" Such words belie the truth: Japan's intended world conquest,  in conjunction with her NAZI allies, as revealed at Corregidor and on the  Bataan Death March, and earlier in China and Korea.
The Japs were very  much a part of the European Holocaust, in that they were willing allies of  the NAZI Party; in this video the blame for the NAZI alliance is laid on  General Tojo, not the Navy, and not the Emperor. The good fellows in Tora!  Tora! Tora! were ""only following orders."" Sound familiar???

271597,4,6300246876,"This is an intriguing and entertaining film, made by two separate and independent teams (one each in Japan and in the US) and lends itself to a fair and less biased presentation of the tragic, devastating, and sometimes  hapless events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese  restless and anxious to flex their military muscle after a period of  military expansion during the 1920s and 30s, are struggling to build an  imperial future, and with the British and Dutch then desperately  preoccupied with their own European problems with the Nazis, the only  nation standing in the way of their ambitions is the United States. With  military adventurism so influential in Japanese society at the time, the  hard-liners seize the stage, expand the Navy,  and prepare for war.
The  United States, meanwhile, is busy trying to figure out who, what, where and  when about the nature of Japanese intentions. Although not mentioned iun  the movie, the U.S. had decided to expand its navy because of the nature of  the Jaopanese threat, so the Japanese naval staff felt constrained to act  relatively quickly so as to preserve and take full advantage of their  tactical and strategic advantage over the American Pacific fleet. They knew  that in two or three years ours would become too real a threat to their  ambitions. Another reviewer said that if we had been more alert the war  could have been prevented, and I strongly disagree. Too many oars were  already in the water to turn around. But I do believe we could have been  much better prepared and lost fewer men, ships and time had we been more  alert and sanguine about the possibility of attack.
ALl that being  said, this is a fairly accurate account of the events and the attack  itself, although at the end you get the distinct impression that the  Japanese commander allowed only one wave of attackers to come in, and this  is not accurate. There were two distinct waves of attack at Pearl Harbor,  the second being more costly and less fruitful for the Japanese attack  force. Most of the battle scenes are well-done and quite realistic. All in  all, this is an excellent depiction of the attack, and I highly recommend  it.",961545600,15,2192,4.786096256684492
271598,4,6300246876,"Tora Tora Tora was a great movie, and DVD only made it better.  Every time I buy a DVD I am surprised not only with the quality but also the extras.  With Tora Tora Tora, you get the movie as well as the original theater  teasers which in themselves are quite historic looking when you consider  how the teasers are made these days.
As a movie, Tora Tora Tora is  exceptional.  The Japanese view was produced by a Japanese production team,  while the American view was made by an American production team.  I thought  this would lead to an authenticity not seen in the usual one sided  Hollywood view one would expect.  But there was a scene where the Japanese  officers are being briefed by their Commander-in-Chief.  When he mentions  the code for recall to Japan, some of the officers jump up and complain  saying it would be bad for morale and that they couldn't possibly do that.  Living and working in Japan and a traditional Japanese company, I cannot  imagine anyone of that era second guessing a superior.  If this really  happened, then I would love to see the evidence to support it.
This  thorn aside, Tora Tora Tora is a must see movie for anyone interested in  the beginnings of the Pacific War in WWII.  It is presented as something  that could have been stoppable, but thanks to a few inept moves by people  who should have known better.

271600,5,6300246876,"I've seen reviews talking both sides of the fence.
In reality, this is not a film that has one combat scene after another. Most of the story revolves around the events leading up to the 'surprise' attack, with the  actual raid on Hawaii taking place at the end of the film.
However, I  would argue that the story is NOT boring. Quite the contrary, it does a  fine job of chronicling the events which led up to the attack -- both from  the American and Japanese side.
Much of the footage centers around  American intelligence putting together pieces of the puzzle and making an  attempt to warn complacent military commanders of a possible confrontation.  Tora, Tora, Tora excels in this respect. You feel the tension mount as the  plot unfolds.
The actual attack scenes at the end of the movie are well  done and provide a suitable climax at the appropriate time.
The musings  and misgivings of the high Japanese Naval commander about attacking America  just before the closing credits gives a touch of drama which does credit to  the Japanese as a people rather than to merely show them as stereotyped,  mindless warriors.

A lot of money was spent on this film, but it was not  wasted because it takes you through the entire planning and political phase  as well as the final bombing of Pearl. This movie is definetly better than  Midway. Although Midway had a interesting story the Sinking of the Japanese  fleet carriers it lacked in accuracy in relation to warplanes and it's  budget for special effects must have been not any because it used old war  footage to try to substitute for action.  By the way about Midway the paint  schemes on those Japanese planes as interesting as they were are  historicaly inacurate. Tora! Tora! Tora! Pearl told as it actually  happened. One of my critics of Tora Tora Tora would be about the Japanese  delgates as embarrased as they must have been.

271666,5,6300246876,"Many films attempt to tell true stories.  One of the few that does justice to its subject is Tora! Tora! Tora!, a full-scale recreation of Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to the Day Of Infamy.
Verisimilitude  permeates throughout the film, from the full-sized mockups of Japanese  aircraft carriers and the battleship Nagano to the Japanese Zero, Kate, and  Val aircraft and American P-40 Warhawk fighters to the miniature and  full-sized models of American battleships.  Much of the combat footage was  shot at Pearl itself and surrounding Air Force bases, while miniature work  blends splendidly into the action.
The enormous cast captures the  exchanges of ideas and arguments among the various players involved in the  attack.  The most sympathetic player is Admiral Yamamoto.  The film very  nicely captures his lack of desire to go to war with an America that could  not possibly lose a war with Japan based on the comparative industrial  power of both nations.  Also captured is the greater bloodthirstiness of  fellow Imperial Japanese Navy officers, leading to a chilling scene during  final pre-sortie debriefing when Yamamoto orders that the First Air Fleet  abort the mission should negotiations with America succeed; fellow officers  universally reject such an order, until Yamamoto hisses that any officer  unwilling to follow should resign at once.
Also captured are the motions  of General Walter Short (Jason Robards) and Admiral Husband Kimmel (Martin  Balsam), working to second-guess Japanese intentions minus intelligence  data available to US Navy intelligence in Washington.  Navy intelligence  accurately guesses that intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages indicate  Tokyo to be preapring for war, but there is never any indication that Pearl  Harbor itself will be attacked.
But it is, and the attack is brilliantly  recreated.  Battleships are hit by torpedos and bombs, planes parked  together to prevent sabotage are slaughtered trying to take off, and the  result is the greatest naval disaster suffered by American arms.
But  Admiral Yamamoto knows that what will result will be catastrophic for  Japan, and the film ends with him staring into the sky - into the  future.
