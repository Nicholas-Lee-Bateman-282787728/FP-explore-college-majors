8495339,2,B000LMPNFE,"The correct, on-screen title of this 1992 Hong Kong romantic comedy hit is ""Now You See Love... Now You Don't"".  The last time I watched this movie was on a laserdisc in the mid '90s.  Before I bought this DVD I confidently felt it would simply be a straight port of the laserdisc, and sure enough, I was right.  The picture quality, while good for a LD, looks ghastly on DVD.  Sharpness, contrast, and brightness are poor.  The widescreen image is shown NON-anamorphically.  If you have 10-year-old monitors, you may get by, and not if you don't.  The 95-minute film is put on a BURNED DVD-R disc, with a 5 Mb/s bit rate.  The DVD menu is just a nonsensical display of date and time, without the typical selections like ""Play"", ""Chapter"", etc.  Could this be a bootleg?  I searched Tai Seng's web site and this disc was nowhere to be found.  And as I mentioned, the disc even has the wrong wording of the film's title on the cover.  This sort of thing depresses me.  Piracy may hurt big film industries like Hollywood, but it CRUSHES smaller film industries like Hong Kong and elsewhere.

The film itself is terrific, however.  Superstar Chow Yun-Fat teams up with his favorite leading lady, Carol Do-Do Cheng, in this offbeat romantic comedy that became a huge hit in 1992.  This is a rare film that is set partly in Hong Kong's rural ""New Territory"" region.  Chow plays an old-fashioned country boy who reunites with his former girlfriend (Cheng) who just came back from England, westernized and educated.  Culture clashes ensue, arguments follow, and Chow and Cheng decide to split and see other people.  The film prominently features an obscure, funny-sounding local dialect, and it relies on many verbal gags as well.  The cultural nuances depicted and satirized in the film resonated with many Hong Kong viewers, many of whom from urban areas who were used to seeing films with urban themes.  Needless to say, much of the film is untranslatable to Western viewers.  The burned-in dual English-Chinese subtitles would also be of little help.  The film was released in 1992's Chinese New Year holidays, which is traditionally a big movie release period in Hong Kong.  Thus, the film has plenty of ""celebratory scenes"" involving parties, get-togethers, and the likes, as well as a happy ending and an overall feel-good atmosphere throughout.",1355875200,3,2345,4.834170854271357
