8079009,5,B000AOEQ38,"First off, I highly advise this inexpensive (poor quality transfers however) collection of genre films. This is a fun dvd set and nicely packaged for quickie gift giving. I will leave the other posted reviews explain the rest of this item.
Secondly I want to comment on one movie. ""Driller Killer"" is one of the MOST unbearable horror films I have ever viewed. It is an interesting mix of film making, at points reminding me of the amateur quality of the Warhol/Morrissey films, but without good acting, did I say they had good acting? Well, at least the Warhol Factory people had charm.  When you mix  the punk/new wave scene of NYC in the 1980's with a psychotic drill killer, what can be the final result? I felt like someone had slipped something into my drink and I was not having a pleasant trip. I find worth in all films, but this movie is really a incoherent mess.",1218412800,4,873,4.518987341772152
8079010,3,B000AOEQ38,"The bloodbaths in the GORE & MORE 10 MOVIE PACK are evenly divided between American and foreign made films. These are definitely 'B' grade, but that always seems to add to the appeal of this type of movie. These ten violence-laden obscurities are certain to satisfy all lovers of scream-and-croak cinema.
