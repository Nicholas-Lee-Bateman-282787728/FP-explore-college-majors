8130017,4,B000GAKVOO,"This DVD offers the aspiring screenwriter a chance to hear a successful screen writer talk about how he became a writer, how often he writes and where he writes, breaking into the business and his work on one of the most significant movies ever made (Fight Club). Mike De Luca usually has a list of well prepared questions that cover all aspects of writing and working in the film industry today. This DVD as well as the others are not really entertainment (although they can be) they are mostly educational.",1163462400,,508,4.655555555555556
8130018,4,B000GAKVOO,"This is my second purchase of The Dialogue series.  David Goyer was my first.  De Luca, the interviewer, is still stiff, 50% of the time doesn't follow up with additional questions that would ""dig"" into the mind of the screen writer or his craft -- he's too focused on reading the prepared questions on his cards.

To me this one was better and more informative than the Goyer interview.  Still the best part is the ""screen writer exercise.""  Uhls was presented with...you'll have to watch it. He did a great job.

I like this idea but the format is dull.  De Luc is chest deep in the film industry, but is not an effective interviewer.",1158451200,,636,4.478260869565218
