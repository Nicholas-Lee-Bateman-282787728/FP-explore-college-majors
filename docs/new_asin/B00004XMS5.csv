7926368,1,B00004XMS5,"I bought this movie based on reviews I read at this site.  I have never regreted buying a movie as much as I regreted buying this one.  What a waste of film and talent.  The story was ok, but the language was absolutely foul.  I know I may be old fashioned, but I think you can still have a good movie without degrading women and cursing every other word.  If you want a good movie buy Fire and Ice or Commitments.  Stay clear of this one.",1044230400,9,439,4.046511627906977
