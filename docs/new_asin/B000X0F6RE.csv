8226307,2,B000X0F6RE,"The ending absolutely kills it; seriously, makes it not worth watching. From reading the other reviews, I see this is based on a Japanese television show from 2002 (Ai Nante Irane Yo, Natsu); might should check that out, instead. This movie is very typical Korean fare with decent actors and ""bad guy turns good"" storyline, but there are better offerings very similar to this specific movie's story- ""Man in Love"" comes to mind. Just skip this, unless you like endings where you say ""is this guy stupid, or what?"" followed by ""So, wait, what happened now?""",1484438400,,556,4.802083333333333
