1368904,5,B00004XPPJ,"This is an intellgent film with a lot of good acting. It does not capitalize on abuse and violence, as a lot of prison films do and gives it a realistic treatment. The only comparable prison pixcture would be ON THE YARD out of the 70's, but this one is more positive in that it offers hope, and that in itself makes Animal Factory more realistic.
  Willem Dafoe is a living great, and whenever he makes a film he brings in great theatrical elements to his roles. His portrayal of feigning insanity in the hole is a Dafoe original. This film brings in other artists and allows them perform as well. The classic shot pans the yard as you hear the soundtrack and then you actually see a con singing the blues and you realize that it's not just the background music, the guy is actually performing live. Like other prison flicks, this one has its share of the inevitable rape and shankings you would find in a prison film, but this one does not give them the center stage.  It doesn't shy away from the difficult issues that other films avoid, but at the same time you can make a claim that it does hold back on repression, abuse and violence you are bond to find in a real prison. It strives and does a good job breaking stereotypes. Tom Arnold is barely recognizable in a cameo that breaks his mold and I did not recognize Mickey Rourke in the aging drag queen he was playing. You can not fault this film for being unrealistic because films are works of arts and this one actually redeems itself.",1004832000,4,1495,4.370503597122302
1368905,5,B00004XPPJ,"this is one of my favourite movies. however that might be because i am a Buscemi, Dafoe, and furlong. This is a lot like Shawshank Redemption, so if you liked that, you will love this. great movie.",1004227200,3,197,4.351351351351352
1368906,5,B00004XPPJ,"I don't know why no one liked the movie, but I enjoyed it soo much, that the next morning I watched it again, I ADORE Edward Furlong for the last 8 years and I think that he's very talented and all his movies are great, and The Animal Factory is one of the bestest! Danny Trejo is always great as well, such great actors, great movie, a great story, great acting!!! I recomended the movie to all my friends and they all agree with me, even those who don't like Eddie! Soo those who don't like it, should watch it again and think twice! Because it is a movie to remember, and now I own it at home ( as all the others Edward Furlong's movies ) and I'm very happy to have it, 'cause I ADORE THE MOVIE!

1368907,2,B00004XPPJ,"Willem Dafoe and Mickey Rourke are what made me rent Animal Factory.  I've always admired Dafoe as an actor and his roles are generally well-acted.  Animal Factory is not a good example of what a prison drama can be. The storyline is basic, but utimately leads nowhere.  Dafoe does an admirable job as Earl, the man with all the juice on the inside.  Earl has everyone in his hip pocket, including guards and inmates.  He basically calls the shots in the yard as well.  Edward Furlong plays Ron Decker, a spoiled rich kid who gets busted for possessing 200,000 dollars worth of marijuana.  The judge and the court system look to make an example of Decker, so he's sent to the animal factory.  Soon he makes good friends with Earl and finds protection behind the prison's walls.  Mickey Rourke plays Furlong's cell-mate, I forget his name but he's a drag queen and pretty damn funny and scary at the same time.  Rourke is only in Animal Factory for about ten minutes.  I haven't read the novel Animal Factory, but I can't imagine that it could be anymore trite or boring than this film.  Steve Buscemi is obviously still learning to direct, the ending of the film feels like it was written in five minutes...way too obvious.  Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this, it's cable fare at best.",985564800,,1300,4.6
1368908,3,B00004XPPJ,The enjoyed the movie but it was missing some continuity.  I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie much at all if I had not read the book and been to fill in some of the parts that were left out.  I worked in a large county jail for a few years and can say that the attitudes among the prisoners as well as some of the relationships between guards and prisoners were realistic.,985478400,3,382,4.08
1368929,4,B00004XPPJ,"A good movie to watch, and very entertaining. The acting was outstanding by all. It does make you wonder about some that really don't belong in the prison system, as most of the ones there do.",1512604800,,192,4.361111111111111
1368930,4,B00004XPPJ,"Steve Buscemi has a face only an indie film could love.  And luckily his career coincided with some of the best of them.  But it soon became obvious that the actor had more to offer than scene-stealing roles in Tarantino and Coen Brothers movies; his career crossed over into the mainstream by association, even elevating to writer / director / star with the well-received Tree's Lounge in 1992.  But with Animal Factory (2000), Buscemi finally took himself out of the equation to focus on the story of Ron Decker, a new fish in the prison system whose survival depends on the unexpected friendship of another prisoner, Earl Copen, an experienced convict who runs the place like a well-oiled machine.

Based on a book by Edward Bunker, a career criminal turned author / actor who had a bit part in Reservoir Dogs and also appears here, the film was shot at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, PA using hundred of prisoners from a nearby correctional facility along an eclectic cast of professional actors.  Edward Furlong (Terminator 2) stars as Ron, a low-level pot dealer who gets a stiff sentence despite the efforts of his wealthy family.  Clueless about prison politics, Ron is lucky enough to attract the attention of Earl (Willem Dafoe), the unspoken leader of the cellblock.

While Earl's intentions are a bit mysterious, Ron's affiliation with him becomes a lifesaver, offering cushy jobs on the inside and protection from rapists like Buck Rowan (Tom Arnold).  But to survive, Ron must adapt to prison life, which jeopardizes his chance at a quick parole.  Thereby asking the rather obvious question: does prison correct criminals or just create new ones?

Buscemi's film is a bit spot-on when it comes to hammering home its message and its second act drifts by without much in the way of any dramatic significance.  But the cast is about as interesting and authentic as they come!  Danny Trejo (who was also a co-producer) headlines a supporting cast of characters who look like mug shots come to life.  Even Mickey Rourke, years before his rebirth in The Wrestler, impresses as Ron's drag queen roommate who dispenses prison yard wisdom and juicy gossip in equal measure.  But it's Dafoe who shines brightest amidst the drab corridors and rusty bars, a surprisingly sensitive messiah who would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.

Directed with an unobtrusive touch that echoes the new-wave realism of the early '70s pictures mixed with The Longest Yard inspired camaraderie, Buscemi shows off the good instincts that have kept him working in front of and behind the camera to this day.  He even works around Furlong's deficiencies as an actor, turning his pre-mumblecore style into an advantage most of the time.  His film might not have anything new to say, but it well spoken at the very least.

Arrow Video's Blu-ray presentation offers a great hi-def representation of an intentionally bland color scheme.  Extras includes an audio commentary with Bunker and Trejo, interview with critic Barry Forshaw who covers Bunker's varied career along with a theatrical trailer and reversible sleeve featuring new commission artwork.",1512000000,2,3146,5.026974951830443

1368932,5,B00004XPPJ,Strange how movies I've never heard of show up on Prime and are better than movies that got tons of publicity and major theater time. This movie is understated and authentic.,1511827200,,174,4.645161290322581
1368933,4,B00004XPPJ,"Animal Factory,"" directed by Steve Buscemi (Fargo), is an adaptation of ex-convict Edward Bunkers prison novel. Edward Furlong (American History X) plays Ron Decker, a 25-year-old inmate facing 10 years in a Pennsylvania State penitentiary for selling marijuana. Taken under the wing of lifer Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), Decker is wary of Copens friendship, but eventually looks to the older man as a way of surviving the menaces of daily prison life. Copen is an experienced con whos mastered the ways of surviving, with both inmates and guards in the palm of his hand.

The film is a powerful critique of the American judicial and prison system that incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than any other country in the world mostly because of increasingly rigid drug legislation. The movie portrays omnipresent brutality in scenes of stabbings, race riots, drug use, attempted rape, and ever simmering violence.

Decker is ill-equipped to deal with the environment and population of his new home and, recognizing his vulnerability, connects with Copen, but its a relationship based off fear and intimidation. Director Buscemi captures the daily terrors of prison life as seen through the eyes of newcomer Decker and provides a gritty account of the men caught up in the penal system and the deals they cut with each other, and themselves, in order to survive.

Dafoe easily dominates the film. His Copen is confident in the status he has developed for himself and has made as comfortable a life as possible for himself within prison walls. The contrast with newbie Decker is dramatic. While Copen knows all the angles and how and when to bend the rules, Decker has been tossed in with desperate men, many of whom feel they have nothing to lose by being model prisoners. There is palpable suspense throughout, as any inmate can snap at any time for any provocation.

Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include an interview with critic Barry Forshaw covering Eddie Bunkers varied career; audio commentary by novelist/co-writer/actor Eddie Bunker and co-producer/actor Danny Trejo; theatrical trailer; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1511827200,,2196,5.230113636363637

1368951,5,B00004XPPJ,"This was a very interesting and disturbing movie that came out in 2000.  Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo were producers of this movie starring both of them and Edward furlong and Willam Dafoe and Eddie Bunker and most disturbingly Mickey Rourke. The name apparently comes from the unfortunate truth about what penal institutions can do to a person who enters on a minor charge to be abused and brutalized to such an extent that they emerge changed forever and not for the better. Mr Dafoe gives a powerful performance as does Mr Furlong as Mr furlong drifts further and further into despair as the horrific treatment he receives changes him forever.  This is in spite of the fact that Mr Dafoe takes him under his wing and tries to protect and guide him in prison survival skills.  Mr Trejo was of course strangely powerful yet comfortable in his role as a cohort of mr Dafoe.  This movie was based on a novel by Mr Bunker.  Steve Buscemi has a relative probably his brother in the movie as a prison counselor. He looks so much like his brother I thought it was him.  He is a sort of ""STEVE BUSCEMI LIGHT"" as he has softer features.  I would definitely watch this again.. By far the most disturbing image for me was Mickey Rourke with full make up fake eyelashes and fake nails not quite wearing women's underwear and a push up bra.  Now THAT was disturbing.  If you can get that image out of your mind the movie is quite good and thought provoking.",1439164800,3,1447,4.47148288973384

Willem Dafoe as the long term resident and ""king"" of the traditional older California prison is incredible (as usual), Edward Furlong is also exceptional as the young inexperienced con.  There is a subtle sexual tension throughout the movie that really helps create the sense of life in prison.  Mickey Rouke, as Janet, is an alone worth watching the movie.  As messed up as he has become, he still is an incredible actor and when he takes a role, he makes it real.  I strongly recommend this move for it's slow paced development, realistic dialogue and reality factor.  Contributors include Danny Trejo and Edward Bunker, both Hollywood names with a serious criminal past, and lots of hard time to call on for their acting and writing.",1421798400,3,842,4.726027397260274

1368973,5,B00004XPPJ,"Before I watched the movie I did research on animal slaughter houses and factories in the United States.  I needed to understand the Metaphorical aspect of the title of the movie and its storyline. I was surprised  to see animals squeezed into block cells before being slaughtered. Then I watched the movie and the deux- machina juxtaposition slammed me in face, at the beginning as prisoners walked out of those similar slaughter block cells. Where the prisoners human souls coming off of animal slaughters? The Director made it so evident that for a second I thought William Dafoe was going to ruffle a feather from underneath his armpit as he spoke to the other prisoners.  The cast was excellent, William Dafoe made me smile, he finally played a nice guy, and Mickey Rourke well his Ms. Jan was exemplary of his Method and Technique acting. I loved his character, his make-up, even the green nail polish.  He made me smile, then laugh and then want to call him up and invite him out to party at La-Rue D'Paris at the Champs D'Leyselles (forgot the spelling) with a lonely gal.

1368977,4,B00004XPPJ,"Animal Factory is the second film directed by Boardwalk Empire Star, Steve Buscemi. The story is about what happens to a young guy who is convicted of a serious crime and sentenced to Federal prison. We've all seen Oz and other shows that take you inside, but this is different. In Animal Factory, you see prison from a totally new perspective, through the eyes of someone who is basically still a child. You see that even if you can figure out how to survive, you still witness untold horrors. Edward Furlong is very underrated and great as always. Willem Dafoe is also very good in what is an unusual role for him. The movie also has some great cameos, including Mickey Rourke as a drag queen claiming to have a vagina.

Every actor, including Edward Bunker himself, did a fine job with Steve Buscemi as both actor and director. However, the revelation here is Mickey Rourke playing a transexual inmate. His portrayal of toughness and sadness, female in a very male body was absolutely superb. His voice, his mannerisms all were totally authentic. His scenes alone made this movie worth watching.

1369011,4,B00004XPPJ,"Animal Factory (Steve Buscemi, 2000)

Steve Buscemi is best known as an actor, thanks in no small part to him being a staple in Quentin Tarantino films, but you know the old line-- everyone in Hollywood wants to direct. Buscemi has actually done his share of it, but the movies that result tend to be minor affairs that get little distribution outside the arthouse scene. That's kind of depressing, especially when it comes to a movie like Animal Factory, with a wealth of acting talent and a script to back it up.

Ron Decker (American History X's Edward Furlong) gets busted for selling dope, and under the strict new laws, is sent to prison for five years on a felony rap. Once in the joint, Decker gets to know Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), a lifer who is, as Morgan Freeman's character calls himself in The Shawshank Redemption, ""the guy who knows how to get things."" Decker and Copen form an odd, complex relationship that's viewed by those outside the prison walls with some alarm.

Furlong, Dafoe, and Danny Trejo, who plays Dafoe's best friend, are only the tip of the acting iceberg in this movie; a host of other fine actors have parts ranging from supporting to bit, including Buscemi himself, Mickey Rourke, John Heard, Tom Arnold, Larry Fessenden, Seymour Cassel, and a host of others; were there not so much focus on Furlong and Dafoe, this would have easily been billable as an ensemble-cast movie, and to an extent it plays like that anyway; there's too much of a main story here for a straight ensemble film, though. (Rourke, especially, is notable here, in his best performance since Angel Heart.) Either way you look at it, this is a strong movie chock full of good performances; the subject matter, and the rather jaundiced way of looking at it, may make some squeamish, but the caliber of the performances here should be enough to overcome that. Animal Factory is a good'un. You want to see it. ****",1184716800,7,1918,4.685459940652819

Since my release from prison in 2003 I am invariably asked the two big questions when it comes to incarceration in this country: A) did I get raped? And B) is prison really like you see on OZ?

Luckily, I didn't get raped and I've never seen OZ but anyone who wants to see what prison is like should get a gander at ANIMAL FACTORY. The entire film drips with authenticity. Within 2 minutes I felt that old queasy feeling in my stomach--exactly as if I were back there myself, all over again.

For those of you out there who might think there is still a bit of rebellious glamour left in going to prison, watch ANIMAL FACTORY and take it from me: being locked up is not cool and its not fun and it is not something that anyone should aspire to.",1173398400,50,1176,4.1946902654867255
1369014,5,B00004XPPJ,"Out of everything i own, this movie is one that is SACRED to me... This one is my fave.. I've seen it countless times...

It has a great cast, great director.. Willem Dafoe is amazing in it... I'd have to say out of all the movies he's been in, i'd rate this one as his best!

Not the best movie for Edward Furlong though (<-- i'd have to say T2 for him), but he played his role well..

And ya gotta love Danny Trejo... he's great in every movie.

This movie is pretty realistic... i mean it's written by an actual convict.. Edward Bunker... and there are actual convicts in the movie as extra's, and not to mention Trejo (who is a real con as well... the special features in this movie explains this, and gives interviews... the special features are awesome..).

If you like this movie, look into some more works by Edward Bunker, especially his books, ""Education of a Felon"" etc...

I can't express enough on how great movie is, so i'll end my review here... if i could give this movie an infinite amount of stars i would, cuase it's that good.

When i was searching for a copy of it, the lowest it sold for was $30, that's what i ended up paying for mine... but i was ready to pay $50 for it... it's definitely worth whatever price it sells for...",1141603200,5,1250,4.271186440677966
1369025,4,B00004XPPJ,"There seems to be no end to prison movies and no end to those of us who watch them. Steve Buscemi's ""Animal Factory"" could have made the also-ran list were it not for the really splendid performance of Willem Dafoe who plays the character of Earl Copen, an 18 year veteran of the prison system who takes the young and vulnerable Ron Decker, in prison for dealing drugs (Edward Furlong) under his wing, in this instance without the sex. Dafoe manages to make this character very human, and we root for him in whatever he gets involved in. The usual requirements for a prison movie are here: guards who look the other way, favoritism because of pay-offs, drugs, violence, racial tension and the sexual undercurrents.

Decker's cellmate is a heavily made-up cross-dresser with muscles who when he is on screen steals the show. I was totally blown away when the credits rolled to see that he is played by Mickey Rourke. You could have fooled me. It is worth watching this film for his performance alone.",1134604800,3,999,4.676136363636363
1369026,3,B00004XPPJ,"Animal Factory is a prison movie.  The title would imply that the prison system takes even ""nonviolent criminals"" and turns them into savage felons, warehousing them in decaying institutions.  A man may not have been an animal going in, but he will certainly be one coming out.  Unfortunately, the movie is not nearly as edgy or interesting as that sounds.

Willem Dafoe plays Earl Copen, a convict at the top of the prison food chain.  Into the mix comes Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a low level marijuana dealer, whose youth and slight frame would normally mark him for the more predatory prisoners.  When Copen befriends Decker, he is spared the torture and humiliation of another young prisoner coming in at the same time as Decker.  What Copen's motives are in protecting Decker are never fully explained.  Dafoe plays Copen as a convict with a Zen vibe.  Whether or not Copen is seeking redemption or sees Decker as a younger version of himself is open to interpretation.

In what I imagine is a fairly accurate depiction of prison life, the days drift by in grinding tedium - men mill about the prison yard; they sit, walk, eat, get high; violence occasionally erupts.  John Lurie's film score punctuates the odd rhythms of the movie.

Regrettably, male posturing frequently supplants believable behavior.  Any interior life of these characters is completely masked.  (Perhaps this is a necessity of prison life.)  Edward Furlong's performance is so low key, it barely registers.  Willem Dafoe, an actor of uncommon intensity, does what he can with what is basically a two dimensional character.

The main problem I found with the film is that most of the characters keep you at emotional arms-length.  I don't have to love or hate a character to enjoy a film, but I do need to feel something.  Otherwise, you just don't care what happens one way or the other.  One of the few exceptions (despite the snarky title line above) is Mickey Rourke, who plays Jan, Decker's sad and damaged cellmate.  Jan is probably the most accessible character in the film.  You just know you've gone to a really weird place when the character you like and identify the most with is a flamboyant transsexual who dispenses sage advice through missing front teeth and whose makeup is pure Rocky Horror Picture Show.  (Yikes!)

Tom Arnold has an especially effective cameo as a vicious bully who is looking to turn Edward Furlong's character into ""Mrs."" creepy hillbilly - or kill him - whichever comes first.  Seymour Cassel has a small role as a world-weary prison guard who would like to help Copen - if only he would let him.

Animal Factory definitely has its moments.  It is just that with a cast of this caliber, I expected more.",1125619200,2,2720,4.806034482758621
1369027,4,B00004XPPJ,"Steve Buscemi's 'Animal Factory' is the most civilized prison film I've ever seen.  It flips the conventions of most jail movies in just the right way without having to be obvious about it.  Yet, does not go quietly by not delivering on the goodies you've come to expect from the genre.  And that takes talent.  Steve has done it again!

Willem Dafoe's lifer character would've been easy pickings to fall into the 'eyes-rolling' category, but doesn't.  He's tough, sure, but actually shows more promise than we're used to with this archetype without, say, the starry eyed idealism of Morgan Freeman in 'Shawshank'.  It is jail, folks, not Hallmark.  He's leather-skinned, but brainy.  He's conniving, but genuine -with the right people.  The father role he steps into with Edward Furlong's 'new fish' character is refreshing and the chemistry between them truly dominates the scenes they're in so much that you're still thinking about said interaction three to four scenes later.

Mickey Rourke sort of stole the movie for me, playing the incarcerated male version of Liza Minnelli.  His lines and mannerisms are so damn funny.  He fits perfectly within the idiosyncratic world Buscemi crafts for us in this film.

And that's the word: idiosyncratic.  This film blooms with said tone the way Jarmusch's earlier efforts did.  It's touching, funny, and outright strange at times.  What a great concept in approaching the making of a prison film in this vein.  It's like Vonnegut in celluloid form.  The ending doesn't buckle either; no great moral, no triumph of the tortured soul.  Just a half-promising, half-depressing denouement to the movie.  I love this film for not falling in between the cracks of being forgettable.  It will join the ranks for me as one of the more underappreciated films of recent memory that deserved to find its audience.

Buscemi has really blossomed into a smart filmmaker.  can't wait to see Lonesome Jim.",1122422400,4,1935,5.031545741324921
1369028,4,B00004XPPJ,"Like his first directorial attempt - Tree's Lounge - Steve Buscemi's second full-length film as a director, Animal Factory, falls just short of leaving a long-lasting impression on the viewer. It's certainly a great improvement over Tree's Lounge as far as production is concerned, and all the right elements - directing, dialogue, acting, cinematography - are in place, but the characters and plot are just not interesting enough to make it unique and memorable. There are tons of prison dramas out there; Animal Factory just isn't news

Still, for what it is, it's a great film and certainly worth your time. More realistic than most prison dramas tend to be, Animal Factory shows a picture of prison life that is much less shocking and brutal than we're used to see in this kind of film, and focuses more on the difficulties of actual day-to-day survival. The story focuses on young inmate Ron Decker (the very talented Edward Furlong, memorable as Edward Norton's younger brother in American History X) and tough guy Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe) and on the relationship forming between them. Nothing new, really, but with two excellent actors and some great, unpretentious directing we get a really lovely film. The rest of the excellent cast includes Chris Bauer, Danny Trejo, Tom Arnold, an unforgettable Mickey Rourke and Buscemi himself in a small part.

A very slow and intimate movie, Animal Factory is not much of a masterpiece but it shows a lot of potential and promise for Steve Buscemi as a director. If you're a fan, if you like Trees Lounge, or if you're fond of prison dramas, Animal Factory is well worth a watch.",1095465600,4,1629,4.877256317689531
1369029,4,B00004XPPJ,"This was a very good flick. What are you looking for out of a movie? The meaning of life perhaps. Heck all I want is 90-120 minutes of good entertainment.

 Being an ex-convict myself I thought it was fairly well written. Prison is rarely what you see on film my friend. Yes it can be brutal and that was displayed in this film fairly realistically however for a long time convict doing time  IS MOST DEFINATELY A GAME.

 A game of survival of the mind and body. William Dafoe's little gang was pretty well depicted. The mockery made here of other prison films is simply because unlike this one, most are a joke.

 As for amazons editorial stating that the convict is obviously attracted to the youngster and that ""sexual tension"" runs throughout the movie, that writer clearly didn't pay any attention to the movie and I'd bet a dollar perhaps didn't watch it at all.

 My bottom line,

  Film was pretty damn realistic, very well written and acted. The characters were good to know and unlike most ridiculous prison movies which focus only on the violent side, this one actually shows people for who they were.

Well worth the time to watch. Enjoy",1094428800,19,1149,4.573529411764706

1369031,4,B00004XPPJ,"Yet another prison movie with a very basic ""plot"": Eddie Furlong is jailed on marijuana charges and is taken under the wing of fellow inmate Willem Dafoe (in another excellent performance) as his protege. The movie is directed by actor Steve Buscemi; who also has a cameo. ANIMAL FACTORY is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Buscemi's RESERVOIR DOGS costar Eddie Bunker. As with almost all prison movies the objective is to escape from the place. One famous sequence from Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY is even ripped off at the movie's climax- and undermines what is otherwise a first class prison flick. Yet another seemingly tacked-on ending.
There were a couple of inspired scenes which appealed to my warped sensibilities: Dafoe and Furlong having a conversation via toilet during their placement in solitary confinement; and the tasteful scene where Dafoe slits his wrists, sprays blood all over himself and eats his own doodoo. Nice.
Tom Arnold also stands out as a hillbilly who wants to get chummy with Eddie, and scariest of all, Mickey Rourke ""as you've never seen him before"" as Jan The Transexual. It would be better for most film fans if we never see him again, and yup, Mickster gets to say his favourite compound word. His mother must be very proud of him.",1039305600,4,1275,4.907407407407407

And, there certainly is no veteran inmate waiting there to take you up under his wing like Willem Dafoe did Edward Furlong. Prison is a lot more brutal than they showed me in this movie. Willem Dafoe is the only reason I took the time out to entertain the thought of watching this movie (nothing against Edward Furlong). I couldn't even recognize Mickey Rourke, and Tom Arnold was weak. At some points in this movie I actually wondered were they intentionally making a mockery out of prison films in general because it just seemed so false.

In fact, more violence would've ruined the intensity of the film as a whole. And thank god for the few moments of comic reliefsome of the only chances a viewer gets to release some of the pent up tension carried throughout the film. My only warning to possible viewers is this...be certain you are in the mood for a serious prison film when you watch, this is not a user-friendly piece of art.",1026691200,2,722,4.604651162790698

7926215,4,B00004XPPJ,"Prison movies have been around for some time. THE BIG HOUSE in 1930 is a perfect example of how far back. But most movies glossed over the ins and outs of prison, focusing on those trying to escape of the camaraderie found among cell mates. But that isn't reality. It wasn't until films made in the 70s began talking about the cold hard facts of prison life including rape, drugs and murder.

When ANIMAL FACTORY came out in 2000 it received high praise from critics as well as those who saw it. But those numbers were small and the film fell into that void of movies you may have heard of but were completely forgotten. With this new Arrow Video release the chance to see it in the best format possible has arrived.

The centerpiece of the story is Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a young man arrested for dealing pot and who is to be made an example of. Sentenced to hard time in one of the worst prisons possible the odds of his surviving unscathed on his own are slim. Fortunately he's taken under the wing of Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), a long time prisoner who knows how things work and is willing to protect him.

Rather than what most would expect here, someone offering protection in exchange for things like sexual favors, Copen becomes a father figure to Decker. He's seen what can happen to a young man here and you get the sense that he wants to atone for past deeds by making sure this man has the opportunity to get out and live his life the way he should.

The film focuses on how the prison works more than anything. While overseen by the warden and the guards it is the prisoners who do most of the work here. We're not talking making license plates of doing laundry but things like fill out reports for the guards, typing up parole requests and more. The guards may oversee them and break them up when a fight begins but for the most part the prisoners run the books.

With that in mind Copen is able to land Decker various jobs in the prison that offer him a chance at easy labor. He takes him into the crew that he's assembles, one that no one messes with and that can get things accomplished behind the confinement walls. Problems might erupt, violence might occur but Copen and his gang avoid that as much as possible.

As Decker's opportunity for parole gets closer Copen instructs him on how to stay clear of problems that might prevent that from happening. When inmate Buck Rowan (Tom Arnold) attempts to rape him, Ron loses sight of the big picture and sets out to kill him. Unsuccessful in his attempt it ruins his chance of parole and earns him 5 more years in prison.

Still wishing a better life for the youngster Copen begins looking for a way to escape. His involvement in the Rowan affair could also lead to his being moved to another prison where he would have to start all over again. The time for escape is now and they begin to find a way to make it happen.

Actor Steve Buscemi has a small role here on screen but a major one behind the camera as he directed the film. While not the most graphic and hard hitting of prison films life there is depicted well enough to instill fear in anyone who thinks they could do easy time. This is a difficult world to travel in and one not to be taken lightly. It is a violent world where the odds of a guard being there at the right time to prevent something bad happening are slim to none.

Dafoe is one of the great actors today. His portrayal of Copen shows that a performance is as much about subtle nuance as it is about speaking the written word. You get the impression by his movements and actions that he has a genuine concern for this young man as opposed to trying to find someone to be his slave.

The weakest part of the film is Furlong. I've never been a fan and his record shows that his abilities are not up to par with those around him. He arrived with a splash in TERMINATOR 2 and from there never made anything worthy of mention or recognition. Here he does little to increase my admiration for him allowing the rest of the cast to carry the film.

What's more interesting about the film that you learn from the extras is that it is based on the book of the same name written by Edward Bunker, an ex-con and criminal who left behind a life of crime to become a novelist, screenwriter and actor. Most will remember him as Mr. Blue in Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS. He has a small role here as one of the prisoners.

Arrow Video is releasing the film with a great digital transfer and extras enough to keep your interest. Those include an interview with Barry Forshaw discussing Eddie Bunker's varied career, an audio commentary track with novelist/co-writer/actor Bunker and co-producer/actor Danny Trejo (who also stars in the film), a theatrical trailer, reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Jacob Phillips and for the first pressing only a collector's booklet containing new writing on the film by Glenn Kenny. Once again Arrow Video shows why they're becoming one of the best companies around for films like these.",1513641600,,5029,4.4484256243213895
