8527092,5,B004DERMUA,"This is such a fantastic resource for teaching Spanish! I started with my 4 year old and he just loves watching Stephanie and the way she has set up the program makes it so he can really master the concepts and words and have fun using them throughout the day! They are short segments which is perfect for his attention span and its helpful to just do a little bit every day.
We feel so blessed to have all for discs and I'm been so impressed as a customer and parent with Stephanie and her wonderful program!",1410825600,,509,4.257731958762887
