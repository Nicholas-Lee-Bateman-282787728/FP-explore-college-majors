8384196,3,B001ERQMUU,"I give this 3 stars because I'm very taken with Leigh's art and it does give one some small insight into his method of operation, which is fun. I love the part where he paints right up to the couch. It is well done too - no complaints there. But it is only about 15 minutes worth at the most. Much too short, which must be why no one lists a length, and neither did I ask. His painted study and The Hieroglyph of the Human Soul was still a work in progress at this point. I do wish they had continued with this film as he went on with it.",1424131200,,538,3.855855855855856
