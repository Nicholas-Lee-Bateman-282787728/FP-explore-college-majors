Brilliant cast - good stories, excellent writing and character development and just the right amount of humor and humanity.  Amanda (Sandra) is gorgeous, and the boys cover a wide range of male proclivities.  Take a look I think you'll become addicted to this whole series.",1399248000,,344,4.896551724137931
5861366,5,B00DW8E6K2,"After 10 years, 3 more original cast follow Jack (James Bolam) by stepping out, surely on to new career roles. It is the season of the change of command but proves by the final pair of episodes it will survive with the same ""oldie"" crime fighting. Exiting this season is Alun Armstrong as Brian and his wife Esther (Susan Jameson). Retired copper Danny Griffin (Nicholas Lyndhurst) is as memory sharp as was Brian, and Dan has a handicapped daughter (computer geek) who fills Esther's role of case help from home. Can the show survive without lead UCOS boss Pullman (Amanda Redman)? Yes, already proven with replacement DCI Sasha Miller (Tamzin Outhwaite) who's just as blonde, bright, feisty, and like all UCOS teamers, comes with her own personal baggage offering subplot material. Brilliant writing of multi-plots and strong new cast will keep this series chasing Midsomer Murders for longevity.
This season's 3 exiting cast are set up for future crime roles. Will that come in spin-off form?

SDH SUBTITLES for all 10 episodes and 2 good bonus segments.
1&2 THE ROCK: 1st ever New Tricks 2-hr, 2-ep story. Brian's past haunts him to violence and acts unbecoming. Sandra's remaining team has a Gibraltar trek sorting 2 murders.

3 THE SINS OF THE FATHER: Gerry's 16-yr-old case takes a turn he disapproves while Brian continues on the brink of a career end.

4 THE LITTLE BROTHER: Brian's investigating again, as a PI, not UCOS, but the paths of crime cross with his old comrades. A grande finale for Brian & Esther.

5 CRY ME A RIVER: Griffin joins UCOS. He knows a bit about everything, annoyingly, as the team tackles a 20-yr adult-filmer murder. Is Griffin a spy?

6 INTO THE WOODS: Sandra, Steve, & Gerry are all afflicted by past events. The UCOS case is a vanished forest runner whose bloody ID is now found. Phyllida Law is a short guest star as the victim's ma.

7 THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER: A new money trail of evidence reopens what had formerly seemed a 1997 political murder.

8 THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY: Sandra is obsessed to solve a 17-yr-old case of a missing teen. It's connected to Sandra's 1st case remaining unsolved--just when she's offered something new. Jack Halford's ghost returns with wise recommendations.

9 ROOTS: New UCOS chief leaves Gerry the long original and he's not happy. But an unsolved immigration allotment murder must be solved.

10 WILD JUSTICE: Only 1 day to investigate an officer and it gets tangled with a case in DCI Sasha's past.

With Gerry the last-cast-Standing, and still stinging the series theme song, and new cast admirably chosen and played, it is a series I can't wait for #11.",1398816000,13,2635,4.771428571428571

5861370,5,B00DW8E6K2,"I can't wait to be able to purchase this series for myself (as soon as it is available in our region).  We have been watching it on PBS and as usual, are enchanted with it.  We find ourselves turning off the phone and any other disturbances so as not to miss any part of the show.  The new cast is just as fun as the older one was, if not more so.  There is energy to spare - the men on the team do show a modicum of respect for their younger,
very pretty team leader Sasha, who leads with a forceful, knowledgeable attitude.  Not only do they try to abide
by her ""rules"" (as given by Gerry Standing), they seem to get along with each other in a ""buddy"" sort of way. My husband and I certainly hope this show keeps on playing for a long time.  It never gets old, and we haven't felt that way about any other series for a long time.",1393200000,29,831,3.9759036144578315
5861371,5,B00DW8E6K2,"Series 10 of New Tricks saw a sea change in this very successful and long running show which debuted as long ago as 2003 and has now run to 87 episodes. By the end of the series the only member of the original team still in UCOS was Jerry Standing (Dennis Waterman). Following the departure of Jack Halford (James Bolam) at the beginning of the last series, it was time to bid a fond farewell to both Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong) and DS Sandra Pulman (Amanda Redman), Brian fairly early on in the series and Sandra in Episode 8.

The cases this time round were quite varied. We start off with a two part story set in Gibralter, which is unusual for New Tricks which has rarely strayed far from its London home in the past. This was a puzzling cold case in which two killings separated by sixteen years were apparently linked. Brian had been getting himself into trouble and there are signs that his days in UCOS were numbered. The change of scenery seemed to suit the team who seemed to excel with the more exotic surroundings. However, the rest of the episodes were back in London, and I would say the stories were a lot more interesting and coherent than, perhaps those in Series 9 when apparently the cast took it on themselves to rewrite some of the scripts!

So how did the new boys and girl get on? Steve McAndrew (Denis Lawson), Jack Halford's replacement, seems to have really settled in with the team now and appears comfortable in the role. However, I was particularly impressed with Dan Griffin, Brian's replacement, played by Nicholas Lyndhurst who is probably best known for his role in Only Fools and Horses. From his appearance in Episode 5, when the team are investigating a murder case from 1980's Soho, he seemed to be a natural for UCOS. This was an inspired piece of casting. The final new boy (or rather girl) was Detective Chief Inspector Sasha Miller played by Tamzin Outhwaite who only had two episodes to make an impact, which she certainly did on the team who were initially very suspicious about this change. However, in many ways she seems like a younger version of Sandra Pulman and even sounds very similar so this is, perhaps, not such a dramatic change.

I would agree with those who have said that it would be good to have more of the personal lives of the participants as there was in earlier series. However, I would say the signs in this respect are good with glimpses of Steve McAndrew's and Dan Griffin's personal life, quite a lot on Brian Lane in the earlier episodes and some pretty dramatic personal developments for Sasha Miller from the word go. Lets hope to see more of this aspect in the future.

So overall this was a good solid series of 10 episodes which will please most viewers. It is not certain where we go from here, and although a new team is in place alongside Jerry Standing, I have not heard that an eleventh series has been announced yet. When it became clear that most of the original actors were leaving I did wonder what the future would hold. However, after this series I see no reason why the show should not continue along the same lines with the new cast, particularly given that the viewing figures for this season remained very strong. It will certainly be different and with the established players leaving it is the end of an era, but there is no reason why the new format should not be equally entertaining.",1389052800,90,3377,4.531147540983606

5861373,5,B00DW8E6K2,"My wife and I both enjoy this series. The script is intelligently written, the characters in the cast all have interesting personalities and come across as real people dealing with the problems that real people have to deal with. But there is just enough of the characters' personal lives and team interaction in the mix to become involved without taking away from the story line. The transitions of team members leaving and new ones coming on board has been handled seamlessly in that each time there has been a change you miss the departed character but immediately get caught up in learning about the new character. Sandra and Brian were both gone by the end of Season 10, both characters I really liked, but the new characters of Sasha and Danny immediately drew me in rather than leaving me with the feeling that I would not like the show as much as before. The show's dialogue is intelligent and witty and has enough comic relief to not get too dry, which my wife especially likes. Definitely deserving of a 5 Star  rating.",1479772800,,1029,4.653846153846154

We don't like the new guy Steve and now we really don't like the newest guy whose name I don't even remember but he is very lugubrious and a dark presence.  What a shame they have sabotaged the show by changing actors and trading funny, intelligent, and interesting characters for the two new dark and dull ones.  We are thoroughly disappointed.  Still love Sandra and Jerry but they cannot carry the show on their own with these two dullards dragging them down.  I'm sorry but I am being really frank.  It used to be our favorite show.

5861384,2,B00DW8E6K2,"When the show started 10 seasons ago it started as a comedy detective story with a bunch of old duffers solving old cases. In seasons 9 & 10 they have managed to get rid of all but one of the original actors and have left all comedy to the winds. What they have now is another Cold Case detective show with mediocre script. I don't intend to say the new actors are bad but the original cast were a unique group of misfits, each with there their own talents for solving the cases.

To my delightful surprise the show did a great job. The first four episodes involved Brian's departure and by episode three I was waiting for a disappointing conclusion, but that didn't happen. Episode four was terrific with an amusing and upbeat ""Ester moment""!!  Sandra's leaving was also handled well especially due to the very poignant scenes with Jack! KUDOS for that...excellent touch! I must admit that I feel very angry and betrayed when I watch a show for years and the characters that I enjoyed end sadly so I am extremely pleased that didn't happen here. I have to say I  won't be watching the next series, as along with new characters the show also seems to have a new tone.

5861407,5,B00DW8E6K2,"I own all the seasons 1-9 so I obviously love this series and so does my husband.  I got 10 from the library because I heard some characters were leaving and did not know if we would enjoy it with them gone.  The episodes here were really good, especially the Gibraltar one where we learned some things about the Island we did not know before.  We were so disappointed when the character Jack left awhile back, but it was still a good series as long as Brian and his wife were in it, though, we thought more emphasis on the home life of the character that took Jack's place was lacking.  Also Gerry and his private life seems to have disappeared.  He has enough ex-wives and kids to give the writers plenty of material  I hope Brian and his wife will make some more appearances in the future.  They were really the highlight of this series when the writers concentrated more on his problems, but why did they leave Gerry and his out.  We enjoy detective yarns but there are way to many out there so the combination of comedy, drama and somewhat weird and loveable older detectives and their private lives was a delight.  We do like the new characters Danny a lot and Sandra's replacement is really good.  I hope the writers take note that most people are not just interested in the crimes, but in the detectives and their interactions with each other and also their private lives.  I am pre-ordered number 11 and hope it gets back to basics regarding them.  If, so, I will continue buying this series to watch over and over again.",1430006400,,1530,4.444444444444445

Without giving away specifics, I like it that they don't just end an character's participation at the end of a season then explain it later.  They make it more organic to the show. After ten seasons, viewers/I care about the characters, so that feels right.

They're running out of plot ideas, so some of the themes repeat a bit, but it's still good fun. I wouldn't rate this as among my top seasons, but it held my interest for medium (not the lightest, but not heavy) entertainment.",1429920000,,529,4.5473684210526315

There are episodes that draw outside the lines of what I expect a police procedural to be able to do (they don't always work but even when they don't, they don't in interesting ways..and when they do:  they can pack a wallop. No spoilers here though).

5861465,5,B00DW8E6K2,"I agree that the Brits seem to be able to produce well written shows that can make you laugh out loud one minute and then be tearing up at the sincere drama of the next minute. This is a unique and entertaining crime drama with good humor and great actors. I became a fan of Amanda Redman in spite of first seeing her in a terribly crap TV movie called ""Suspicion"". She was clearly working hard to make that script interesting and I knew an actress that determined must be good. Now that I'm seeing her in a decent show I am not in the least disappointed. She is great (and getting more beautiful with each year). She's completely believable as the tough policewoman in charge of this motley crew of men, and the guarded, reluctantly vulnerable woman sort of dating a younger man. The entire cast is superb. Alun Armstrong has never disappointed in anything I've ever seen him in and he is hysterical as the cop on multiple meds in this show. It's nice to see real looking people rather than bimbos & himbos. These are talented actors having a good time and creating something extremely entertaining. Great price and Watch this it is a great show. I have all the seasons.",1409356800,3,1171,4.4766355140186915

Brian Lane (played by Alun Armstrong) and Sandra Pullman (played by Amanda Redman) will solve their last cases during this Season and be replaced by Danny Griffin (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) and Sasha Miller (played by Tamzin Outhwaite).

I must say ""New Tricks"" has been right up there with my favorite British productions.  I still enjoy going back and watching the very first episode in Season 1 and I continue to pick up on little nuances I've overlooked before.  Lots of laughs even though it is basically  a bunch of retired detectives trying to solve old cases.  Well, Amanda Redman who is head of UCOS is not retired.",1404432000,,636,4.478260869565218

5861523,5,B00DW8E6K2,New Tricks was a surprise for me and have purchased all the 10 series. The characters are each strong enough to have a segment about them and each has strengths and demons that they bring to work . The pilot is a big surprise..do t often see a looker like Amanda Redman knock a couple of people out! Started off with a real bang! I have watched each season several times and they became a family ...great writing and development . After 8years people want to move on and so this is the year for two to leave so only one original Indian left. The replacements also surprised me and they will hold it together but writing has to stay sharp..a challenge. So THANKS for 10 seasons of really good entertainment! Hope you all keep showing up in BBC things we can get this side of the Pond!,1404086400,,783,4.297297297297297

5861527,4,B00DW8E6K2,"We all loved the cast of New Tricks and I was sad to see them leave, but understandable  since the show has been on so long.  That being said, I think we should see how Series 11 would appeal to all of us and give them a chance to set their own style.  I do think that they could use a little humor but the new cast will have to set their own stamp before we can say yea or nay.  I do agree that we weren't impressed with Molly, the new head of UCOS, but she may work out. I am certain the producers are looking at reviews to see how the new characters are accepted and if we aren't fond of them, there will probably be ""retirements"" or ""transfers""  CLOSED CAPTION  My rating was based on the new cast and a wait and see if the new cast will be as good.",1403913600,,753,3.857142857142857
5861528,5,B00DW8E6K2,"Series 10, is special ! This is not saying anything against series 1-8, I still like those. But -- the transition year Season 9, and now the new Season 10 are a super pair.

I'd been watching lots of BBC and other British TV, so am pleased to see Nicholas Lyndhurst (from TV ""Only Fools and Horses"" with David Jason).  Along with that, I'd accidentally discovered the early seasons of a newer British TV series ""Hotel Babylon""... and that's how I already know the actor who is the new boss at ""New Tricks""  Tazmin Outhwaite, playing Sasha Miller.  It does help knowing the actors aleady.

A little more trivial irony:  the ""Hotel Babylon"" series is getting mixed/sinking reviews after this character left.  I'm going to interpret what seems to be further rising of the reviews for ""New Tricks,"" as an absorbtion of that other change.",1403913600,,833,4.703448275862069

Using deductive powers and their collective experience as detectives, these three men and one woman take on cold cases in a new department. Cases are very interesting.
This is a really good British series that has held up for 10 years, of which 8 have the entire original team of actors, one change in the 9th year, and another change in the 10th. Smoothly done replacements will probably give this series another couple of good years.",1403827200,,595,4.622641509433962

5861544,3,B00DW8E6K2,"With the loss of both Brian and Jack, the series has lost heart and soul.  Jerry tries to ground us in UCOS but gets little help from Steve and Danny.  Steve, at least, is a familiar face and we have some history with him but Danny is just an odd egg with an annoying and odder daughter.  Molly just doesn't seem to fit.  Nothing to do with her disabilities, she has a grating attitude that I could neither find appealing nor sympathetic.  I can remember watching the very first episodes, as they were then played on local PBS TV, and found the gang of misfits charming and refreshing.  Molly and her Dad are very poor imitations.  There is hope in Sasha, though, and I'll give season 11 a try when released.",1401840000,2,708,4.358778625954199
5861545,5,B00DW8E6K2,"It is no secret that further changes were in store for NEW TRICKS after the departure of James Bolam, one of the original four leads, back at the end of Season Eight. Anticipating these changes has been fun, though some people have had reservations.

With the release of NEW TRICKS Season 10 in North America from Acorn (that purveyor of so many classy British and Commonwealth-produced programs) fans of the series outside of the United Kingdom can now decide for themselves how well the transitions work.

Inevitably there will remain some trepidation on the part of many viewers, wondering if the show will, in the long run, be ruined by these changes. From the perspective of this reviewer, those concerns are, for the most part, dispelled after watching all ten of the new, excellent episodes of this beloved series. True, one cannot help but miss Alun Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of troubled Brian Lane (not to mention Susan Jamieson's manifestation of Brian's long-suffering wife, Esther). But their send-off episode (number four in this set) is extremely satisfying. It even leaves the door open to a possible spin-off series featuring the two retirees as independent detectives!

Equally well written and executed is the eighth episode, when Amanda Redman moves on (the details of which will not be revealed here). In short, it all works. In the excellent bonus features the stars talk candidly about the changes, including their mixed emotions about leaving the show: namely sadness and excitement at the prospect of playing other roles, roles they would otherwise not be able to take on given their six month per year commitment to filming NEW TRICKS.

So what about the new kids on the block? By now, viewers will have become accustomed to Denis Lawson as Steve McAndrew, who replaced the irascible James Bolam. The trickier transition is Nicholas Lyndhurst replacing Alun Armstrong. Lyndhurst is your typical British character actor: versatile, professional and reliable. Possessed of ordinary looks, with close set eyes that make him look as if he is always thinking, processing information (much like Armstrong's Brian), Lyndhurst brings a more serious touch to the UCOS team, which balances beautifully with the more energetic Denis Lawson and the ever volatile Dennis Waterman. Lyndhurst's at times almost sad demeanour makes him less accessible than the others, but as the episodes go by he draws the viewer in with his understated line delivery and somewhat quirky obsession with little-known facts that in the end often make a valuable contribution to the group's crime solving efforts. He also has a wife in a high security mental institution (whom we have not yet seen) and a daughter at home with cerebral palsy (played by Storme Toolis, one of the few working actors in the U.K. who really does have a disability--in addition to her real-life cerebral palsy, she also uses a wheelchair). By the end of Series 10 we know enough about Lyndhurst's Danny Griffin that we want to know more, which in short means we have accepted him as part of the team.

A little harder to accept, at least so far, is Tamzin Outhwaite as DCI Sasha Miller, Sandra's replacement. Of course, how can you ""replace"" Amanda Redman? You can't. Ms Outhwaite has big high heels to fill. But given some time to adapt--since she only appears in the last two episodes of Season 10--I suspect she'll do just fine. If you really think about it, there SHOULD be some awkwardness about this fundamental change to the team's (and the show's) chemistry. This is simply the way it is in real life when a beloved person leaves a close-knit collaboration. Why shouldn't the series reflect this?

To her credit, DCI Miller does not come in and try to rock the boat. She is less of a dynamo than Sandra was and more of an observer at first. When we realize her caution masks a competency that shows her to be worthy of her new promotion, which had, in turn, led to her becoming the new leader of UCOS, it becomes apparent that perhaps her initial reticence was a tad deceptive. I'm sure once Ms Outhwaite has Season 11 under her belt and we've come to know her better, all will be well.

After all, everything is in a state of flux, so why not NEW TRICKS? There's plenty of life left in this outstanding show. The writing is still sharp and the production values high. Trying to guess the circumstances under which both Brian Lane and Sandra Pullman transition on to other things isn't easy. In fact, there are some genuine surprises in Season 10, including the first ever NEW TRICKS two-part storyline, set on Gibraltar, which starts things off with an exotic touch. The cast talk about this in one of the bonus features, including their various adventures with the monkeys that are so prevalent on the British Territory of Gibraltar, which of course includes the famous promontory the Rock of Gibraltar.

Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Up til now, the old adage from which NEW TRICKS obviously gets its name has been answered in the affirmative. Now that most of the dogs have changed, and are younger, to boot, why not continue?",1401753600,3,5121,4.851258581235698
5861546,5,B00DW8E6K2,"Does anyone know if this new season ten is for Region 1, it doesn't say in the details. Love this series.",1401235200,,105,4.0476190476190474
5861547,5,B00DW8E6K2,"After a few thousand reviews that I've posted on Amazon this may be one of the hardest for me to write.  ""New Tricks"" is a detective/mystery series and - if you've read my other reviews - you'll know that I do not like ""spoilers"" (nor do I read reviews with ""spoilers"") because I think it is unfair. So you won't read ""spoilers"" here if I can help it. And - in this case it's not easy. But on with my review:

First off, if you've come to this review of the 10th series of ""New Tricks"", I don't think I need to describe the series as you have, hopefully, like me, watched - and enjoyed - the previous nine seasons. IF NOT, skip this, and all the other reviews on this listing and go back and buy Season One and start at the beginning. This is a ""character driven"" series and you need to watch it from the beginning. And - trust me - this ranks (with ""Miss Fisher's Mysteries"") among the top British DVD series of all time.

So, if you are with me this far I'll give you some info on Season 10. There are many ""changes"" this season and I guess I can't hide the fact that two of the original actors, who have been with the series since the beginning will depart this season, but when and how you will need to see for yourself. And you might even see one of the previously ""departed"" members return. The producers and writers have used these changes to go back in the personal history of the cast to bring up old memories and tie up some loose ends. After the first few seasons you have probably noticed that it not the cases that the UCOS are given to solve are not the reason to watch. It's the personal lives of each of the ""team"" - and the brilliant acting by each of them - that keep you coming back. And, in this season, the cases are both weird and often confusing but that's beside the point. Brian, Jerry, Sandra and Danny are like old friends and you care for what happens to them. THAT is the reason I can say that - while not up to early seasons, you need to see this season too. There are other ""changes"" as well. The first two episodes are a two-part story (the series' first) and so you should watch them together. And for the first time in my memory, the episodes do not end with Dennis Waterman (Jerry Standling) singing the upbeat ""It's Alright"". And the episodes are darker. But, after all, we care about these characters.

The DVD set contains two ""bonus features"", both of which contain ""spoilers""- so save watching them until you've watched all 10 episodes. The first tells about the filming of the two-part episode filmed in Gibraltar (10 min) and the other is a ""behind the scenes"" featurette which includes scenes from past seasons as well as this one. It runs 14 minutes and gives you a chance to see that the actors are not that different in voice and demeanor than they are in their roles.

So, I can't give this season a true five stars- as that would put it on the par with the earlier seasons which had more interesting - and better crafted - cases. Maybe it's a 4.5 rating. But I'll round it up and just hope that the narrative above will guide you. From what I can see by scanning the titles of other reviews - most of them are based on Amazon Instant streams or on the earlier UK release. The DVD set will be released on June 3rd. (I received an advance review screener from RLJ, the distribution company).

I should also point out that the DVD contains the 58-minute original UK versions of the episodes. The show was broadcast on PBS but I'm guessing it was ""edited"" version. The DVD does include graphic violence and strong language is used, including the ""S"" word. This won't affect most people but it is not ""G"" rated for family viewing.

I hope that this review was both informative and helpful, without providing info which will decrease your enjoyment of watching the 10th season.

I think the writers handled it with class.
Still, it's sad to see the group change up.
The new members will have big quirky shoes to fill.
I'm unsure how the Sasha character will find a niche.  Not directive like Sandra which was her strength.
It was always so nice with older guys having guts and crustiness.  Slower but wiser.  It's expected in younger characters to be higher energy.  That then makes it like any other show dynamic. Old history is now on the computer instead of first-hand.",1400544000,,521,4.559139784946237
