The instructions lasted about 40 seconds by Renee sitting in a chair telling you to use the ""get it"" command, ""bring it command"" whenever you sneeze. There was no step by step instructions of any type; just her telling you to do it.

Don't waste your hard earned cash by blowing it away with this video. I wish I could return it because I am so unsatisfied. There is much more detailed and free information on clicker/trick training on the internet.",1152144000,,518,4.4526315789473685

This video will help any dog owner get a good start in training their dog. Very informative. Glad to see a training video that encourages rewards for good behavior instead of punishment for bad behavior.",1011052800,2,269,4.510204081632653
7915943,1,B00002NDSM,This was a real waste of money. I was so disappointed hoping to see some real unusal stuff. There was really only one trick which explained the progression but it was all just basic stuff. I was not amazed AT ALL.... Don't waste your money,1006819200,,239,4.333333333333333
