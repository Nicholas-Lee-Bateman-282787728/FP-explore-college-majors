144248,5,0792839129,This is one of the best movies ever when I was a kid and still love to watch this movie. This movie is very exciting and entertaining for all in the family.  Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Dick Van  Dyke did an awsome job in this movie. A must see!,926640000,2,267,3.925925925925926
144249,4,0792839129,"This film never did get the credit it deserved.  The songs are instant favorites (despite what other reviewers might say about them).  Any child that liked the Wizard of Oz or Willie Wonka would love this film too.
Dick Van Dyke is very entertaining as a mad inventor that creates a  magical car.  This film has some of the most unforgettable scenes in  cinema. This is the film that Grease (the movie) got it's closing scene from!! From the musical scene set in the candy factory, to the king of  Bulgaria's birthday party, your kids will be watching this one over and  over again.  And you'll find yourself sneaking peaks as well.
My advice?  Buy it today!",911952000,,658,4.555555555555555

144409,5,0792839129,"This is considered one of those movies that's a classic with kids and adults alike. Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes brings the story to life about an inventor that creates a magical car that seems to be alive with talent. This movie was made at just the right time in my life and seeing it growing up in the '70s was a kids dream. I have fond memories of it and still enjoy it to this day. I bought an older DVD ""Digibook"" 2 disc edition years ago. It is a wonderful edition and now I had to upgrade the movie itself to the VERY well done Blu-ray by MGM. Trust me, when you watch this in 7.1 DTS English HD, you will know the words to virtually every song. lol
The picture looks BETTER THAN EVER before. It is very nicely done over the regular DVD copy. I compared both and the HD Blu fixes things in image quality that were there in the DVD.
This 50th ANNIVERSARY EDITION, (NOT 90th as the title suggests as it was made in 1968), has some great special features that were brought over from the DVD. Now, they are on Blu-ray. There is one feature that is NOT on the Blu-ray and that is some game that can be played on the 2nd DVD. I kept that with my Edition I already had. I just added this Blu-ray to it. Now I have the Ultimate Edition of this movie and I love it!
*** Highly recommended!",1514419200,2,1293,4.0546875
144410,5,0792839129,I hadn't seen this movie in probably 25 years but saw it on sale so figured i would pick it up as i loved it as a kid and watching it instantly brought back a lot of fond memories of sitting on my grandpas lap in the 80s and watching the movie countless times.  despite being so long since i have seen it i still remembered every song once they started just like it was yesterday i last watched it.,1514419200,,398,3.975
144411,1,0792839129,"Very disappointed!  Bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present, tried to watch it today, Christmas, and not only would it not play, but nearly seemed to break my dvd player as I couldn't open the slot to get it out after trying multiple times!  Finally managed to get it out at which time we discovered the dvd appeared to have ""flaws"" in it which might be the cause of the problems.  Love the movie by the way, just not THIS dvd which was unwatcheable!",1514160000,,462,4.348837209302325
144412,5,0792839129,"Only in the Sixties could such an off-the-wall family pic be made.  Strong Bond pedigree here.  Cubby Broccoli produced from Ian Fleming's source novel.  Ken Adam did the production design.  Gert Frobe (""Goldfinger"") is the resident baddie.  You even have Desmond Llewellyn (""Q"") in a bit part.  Raold Dahl co-scripts with director Ken Hughes. Dahl did the adaptation of ""You Only Live Twice"" one of the more intriguing Sean Connery 007 excursions.  I think Hughes co-directed the 1967 Bond debacle ""Casino Royale"" but I'm not sure.  All you need is a Maurice Binder title sequence and the picture is complete.  Dick Van Dyke wisely chooses not to affect a British accent a la ""Mary Poppins"".  Probably should have gotten an Oscar nomination for that one virtually stealing the show from star Julie Andrews.  Van Dyke proves here he is still a nimble song-and-dance man with charisma to boot.  Requisite female co-star Sally Ann Howes reminded me of one of those bland Hitchcock blondes that the Master favored so much.  A couple of nondescript kids on hand whose names escape me won't make you forget Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice.  Lionel Jeffries, so wonderful in Peter Sellers' early British comedies most people haven't seen, is a hoot as granddad who may have seen a little too much action in the service of Queen Victoria.  Frobe and Anna Quayle, resplendent in quasi-French maid regalia, have a pretty loopy musical number.  Can't forget Quayle's hysterical exchange with John Lennon in ""A Hard Day's Night"".  Few debits are Benny Hill, one of the funniest men on the planet, wasted in a role as a toymaker.  Sherman brothers soundtrack serviceable but not up to ""Mary Poppins"" standards save title tune.  Years ago someone told me this was their favorite movie of all time.  Didn't register at the time but I kind of get it now.",1514073600,,1840,4.874193548387097

144442,4,0792839129,"RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Ken Hughes, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang chronicles events when an unsuccessful inventor (Dick Van Dyke) turns a dilapidated Grand Prix car into a fancy vehicle for his kids in England during the 1910s. With an upper-class woman (Sally Ann Howes), they go on a picnic which morphs into an amazing adventure to save their eccentric grandfather (Lionel Jeffries) in a kingdom on mainland Europe. Gert Frbe & Anna Quayle play the ee-vil baron and baroness while Robert Helpmann and Benny Hill play the Child Catcher and Toymaker.

This is a family-friendly adventure/fantasy/musical in the mold of The Wizard of Oz (1939), Mary Poppins (1964), Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) and Into the Woods (2014). I remember loving Chitty when I was a kid and was wondering how it would hold up as an adult and its entertaining when you're in the mood for something fun, innocent and non-dismal/horrific. However, like those other flicks, there are dashes of dark, adult-oriented stuff, like the grotesque Child Catcher, the hottie (but inwardly hideous) baroness prancing around in her undergarments and the kids throwing soldiers off a cliff.

There are also some spectacular European locations, like the breathtaking Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany. The only problem is that the movies overlong by 30-45 minutes; they shoulda cut some of the unnecessary songs. But the title tune is a classic.

THE FILM RUNS 144 minutes and was shot in England, France and Germany. WRITERS: Roald Dahl & Hughes from Ian Flemings book (with additional dialogue by Richard Maibaum).

I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down.

It has adventure, traveling, humor, music, a villain, a hero, romance, family values, life lessons, imagination, creativity, horses, dancers, prancers, candy, a beach, a castle, toys, and so much more, including a magical car. The last time I saw this movie was on VHS. I cannot believe how clear this is. They really cleaned this up and made the Blu-ray purchase totally worth it. Sometimes Blu-rays of older films are just a direct transfer. This was obviously meticulous cleaned and restored. When Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was first rolled out of that shop, I felt like I was right there with it. It was so real to me and no longer something on TV. I really enjoyed seeing this film all over again some 14+ years later. I will enjoy this time and time again over the years.

145555,4,0792839129,"American icon, actor and comic genius Dick Van Dyke follows up his famous role as Bert in Disney's classic ""Mary Poppins,"" with his his role here as an inventor. Dick Van Dyke ended his long run on his legendary sitcom and acted in this musical gem of a film.

The story about a magical car who flies and floats in the early 1900s where single father Caractus Potts with his two children, Jeremy and Jemimah, venture on an unforgettable journey with Truly Scrumptious (played by Sally Ann Howes). The film has plenty of memorable familiar faces like Barbara Windsor, Benny Hill, and others.

The only extra features are the trailer and sing along but during a viewing. It is still a fun, lively energetic film with Van Dyke in the lead role. I would have like added extras like behind the story of filming.",1440115200,,806,4.590277777777778

145558,5,0792839129,"My husband really wanted to watch this movie for ""movie day"" with our kids, ages 3 & 6. I couldn't remember what the movie was about, but when he read the description of the movie, the kids voted to watch it (although, I'm sure they would have rather watched Frozen or The Neverbeast, I think it was my husband's enthusiasm that ultimately won them over). The movie is typical of the era of Dick Van Dyke movies with lots of song & dance. One of our favorite ""old"" movies is Mary Poppins. This one is a bit more intense on the imaginary front for the little ones. There were a few parts that were upsetting for the kids: when Chitty was captured by the Vulgairian soldiers my 6 year old was upset, & they both seemed a bit bothered by the ""child catcher"". If you have sensitive young ones that are not sure what is real & not real, then you may want to pass on this movie until they are older. Overall, nobody had any nightmares & the songs are fun & memorable. Both kids were singing the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang song.",1439683200,18,1018,4.252577319587629

145837,2,0792839129,"I saw this years ago, as an adult, though I remember seeing commercials for it as a child. I know this is based upon a book written by Ian Fleming for his young son, and does not much follow it, just as Disney's ""Pinocchio"" didn't much follow Collodi's original. I rented it out of curiosity; how good was this movie? This movie has gotten mixed reviews here, which is no surprise to me. On the one hand, the car looks delightful and the scenery, if not the special effects, are good. The villains who kidnap the car and its owners are scary, especially when our heroes are in Vulgaria and note that there are no children around, and we are relieved when they get their comeuppance. The part where the Baron's henchmen fall into the sea and have to swim to their country-only to have to swim away when they reach it, is hilarious. On the other hand, Dick Van Dyke is supposed to be English and he sounds American, none of the songs are memorable, and the movie is overlong.

Overall, it's probably not the first thing you want to take your children to see. I haven't seen the book, but it's probably more interesting.",1433894400,,1117,4.422330097087379

Started watching this with my 3 year today (yes, my mistake for not vetting a movie before watching with my 3 year old). All was merry and bright until the intermission. Post intermission, I feel like the car dropped off a cliff into the twilight zone: A creepy child catcher dressed in undertaker's clothing. A ""barren""ness who hates children. A creepy scene with her in lingerie and the baron, her husband, trying to kill her. Lost children who storm the castle and tie up the adults, wielding pick axes and scythes. Seriously? I was disturbed and I'm 30. I fast forwarded most of that junk and I'm sure it went over my child's head, thankfully. Never again.

146079,2,0792839129,"SPOILERS TO FOLLOW

First off, we decided to watch this movie because of the terrifying abomination that is ""Tusk"", do not recommend watching it. Long story short, imagine Buffalo Bill makes a walrus suit and puts it on the main character from Accepted.

Anyway - knocking off 5 stars because the car is a huge lie. It doesn't float, it doesn't fly, it doesn't even sing (and this is a musical people). Despite the cover being like ""YO DAWG, THIS CAR FLIES, WATCH THIS MOVIE""....huge disappointment. Especially when you find out that this magical flying car is really just the Dad's schizophrenic story about pedophiles in Europe. Yes, an area in Europe where all the children get snatched up and brought to the King....seems pretty flippin' suspect to me.

The movie gets a star back because the lead female is named ""Truly Scrumptious"".... pretty much the greatest old lady pick up line every..""yo gurrrl, idk whatchu about...but you Truly Scrumptious in my eyes"". Been seeing some serious results down at Saturday Morning Bingo.

Finally, the movie gets another star back because the writers had some sort of time machine. In minute 15 of the film Dick Van Dyke starts talking about how he's ""going to send moving pictures over wireless""....uhhhhhh this movie is from the 1960s...pretty sure Al Gore hadn't invented the internet and REALLY sure that Jeff Bezos hadn't started up Prime Video....So take a step back, admire that, because it's worth a damn star.

Overall, not impressed by this film. Only reason you should watch it is if you feel like being lied to, followed by a great feeling of regret and disappointment.",1429747200,,1625,4.8945454545454545

I think the first time he watched it he was only 1 1/2 years old; he watched it over and over until finally it wouldn't play anymore. LOL But would you believe he asked me to get him a new one just before Christmas of 2014 & he turned 11 in August of 1014. Believe it or not, he loved that movie so much he wanted it again, another one he wanted from when he was little was Aristocats.  I was able to get that one for him and now he has Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in DVD & blu-ray as well.  And imagine I got both of them in one box for just under $8.00; what a steal, Amazon does it again for me!!!!!! I'm glad I got both styles of DVDs because his sister is 5 years old and she only has a regular DVD player in her bedroom, so she'll be able to watch it if she'd like. If the whole family watches it they'll have the Blu-ray copy to use in the living room.  I'm going to start looking for Lady & the Tramp # 1 & 2 next; Amazon has them, but I'll wait for a great price on them like I got on these!",1424131200,2,1169,3.802469135802469

I saw it at a Drive-in theater with my Mom when I was 7 years old & I remember it because it's funny in a way! it's about an old Gran Prix motorcar that gets transformed into a car that can float on water & fly in the air! There's 2 children named Jeremy & Jemima in this movie & it's all about an inventor named Charactus Potts & a lady named Truly Scrumptious! They leave England to save their Father & Grandfather & to free the children of Bulgaria! Benny Hill was in this movie as well & he played the part of the toymaker!

146870,5,0792839129,"CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG [1968] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] A Vivid, Splendid Ride! The Most Fantasmagorical Musical Entertainment in the History of Everything!

Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, start your engines. You are about to take an incredible ride with one of the most wonderful family films of all time. With its clever tunes, including the 1968 OSCAR Nominated Original Title Song. Marvellous cast and enchanting storyline, this delightful romp is lots of fun and simply ""toot sweet"" to pass up! Dick Van Dyke stars as eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts, who creates an extraordinary car called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It not only drives, but also flies and floats, as it leads him, his two children and his beautiful lady friend, Truly Scrumptious [Sally Ann Howes], into a magical world of pirates, castles and endless adventure.

FILM FACT: ""Doll on a Music Box"" is sung near the end of the musical by Truly Scrumptious and is a musical counterpoint, also being sung simultaneously with Caractacus Potts' rendition of the song ""Truly Scrumptious."" Two songs apparently intended for the film but ultimately relegated only to instrumental background music are ""Come to the Funfair"" and the ""Vulgarian National Anthem."" The Caractacus Potts inventions in the film were created by Rowland Emett. In 1976, Time magazine, describing Rowland Emett's work, said no term other than ""Fantasticator...could remotely convey the diverse genius of the perky, pink-cheeked Englishman whose pixilation's, in cartoon, watercolour and clanking 3D reality, range from the celebrated Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway to the demented thingamabobs that made the 1968 film `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' a minuscule classic."" The part of Truly Scrumptious had originally been offered to Julie Andrews, to reunite her with Van Dyke after their success in `Mary Poppins.' Julie Andrews rejected the role specifically because she considered the part too close to the Mary Poppins mould.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: When one thinks of Ian Fleming, one name usually pops to mind: Bond; James Bond. But in 1968, another of Fleming's creations made the leap to the big screen with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. This curiously titled film is based on a children's book by Ian Fleming and stars Dick Van Dyke, who previously appeared in the highly successful 1964 fantasy film, Mary Poppins now appears as Caractacus Potts, an inventor who spins a remarkable tale for his two children about a magical flying car.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' belongs to a class of films that are often mistaken for Disney productions when they're in fact not. While on other movies the reasoning doesn't usually go further than the use of animation or archetypes made popular by Disney, in the case of `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' the confusion is more warranted. Dick Van Dyke playing the male lead in a splashy, two-and-a-half-hour 1960s musical with songs by the Sherman Brothers and score by Irwin Kostal is understandably reminiscent of Mary Poppins. `Throw in a prim and proper female lead and two children, all from England, and the comparisons to Disney's 1964 classic are inevitable.

Loosely based on a book by creator Ian Fleming, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' finds its protagonist by way of Caractacus Potts [Dick Van Dyke]. Caractacus Potts is an inventor, but not a very successful one. As the single father of children Jemima [Heather Ripley] and Jeremy [Adrian Hall], he struggles to make ends meet. The children request he save a used motorcar from destruction, so Caractacus Potts has it completely refurbished, christening it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang based on the sound it makes.

With Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the trio meets the refined, well-to-do  Truly Scrumptious [Sally Ann Howes], daughter of a rich candy factory owner. She joins the group on a picnic that leads to storytelling from Potts. In his tale, the petulant and greedy Baron Bomburst [Gert Frbe] seeks to steal Chitty for himself. Unable to do so, he kidnaps Grandpa Bungie Potts [Lionel Jeffries], thinking him to be the creator of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car. Thanks to the features Caractacus Potts has installed in the vehicle, the gang follows Baron Bomburst by both sea and air to the land of Vulgaria, where children are strictly prohibited. Now Caractacus Potts finds himself having to both rescue Grandpa Bungie Potts and keep his children safe.

The second half of the picture works much better, which is unusual, since many musicals have a strong first act to which the second can't compare, especially with films of the genre of The Sound of Music,' `Funny Girl' and `Fiddler on the Roof' immediately come to mind. That's not to say that `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' in Act II isn't perfect, however. The whole thing is played pretty much as a farce and because of that, there's barely a sense of peril. Only two scenes involving Robert Helpmann's as the creepy Child Catcher character present any real tension.

Even at its most self-serving, the picture is still entertaining for a variety of reasons. The songs by Richard and Robert Sherman are as strong as those of their other works. The title song and ""Toot Sweets"" both stay in one's head for days while ""Doll on a Music Box"" has a haunting quality to it. The choreography by Mary Poppins' Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood is also impressive, particularly on ""Toot Sweets"" and ""Me Ol' Bamboo."" Often, musical numbers have a different feel from their surroundings, but these ones display just as much creativity and imagination as the dramatic scenes.

The screenplay, by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes, who also directs, is remarkably good. The music is not distinguished, but with lyrics by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, like ""Oh, what a lovely, lonely man,"" and ""There's magic in the wake of a fiasco"" and lines like ""Zis is X speaking."" The film, which accelerates, as a musical should, as it goes along can hardly miss. The preoccupation with sweets and machinery seems ideal for children. There is a very jolly, well done dance number, in which Miss Sally Ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke play puppets in Vulgaria, and another wittily vicious, patty cake minuet, choreographed by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.

Dick Van Dyke essentially plays himself here, which is just fine as he exudes natural charm as always. His charisma is almost enough to make one forget he's the sole American in this production, a fact that makes him being the father of two British children a bit odd, and Dick Van Dyke reportedly refused to do an accent for the film after the criticism he endured for his Cockney one in `Mary Poppins.'

The rest of the cast is likewise appealing and obviously having a great deal of fun. Most surprising is Gert Frbe. Having only seen him as the calm and collected Bond villain Goldfinger, his over-the-top temper tantrums as the Baron are quite a revelation. Other cast members like Sally Ann Howes, Benny Hill, and Lionel Jeffries feel slightly underutilised, but they make the most of their screen time, particularly Lionel Jeffries.

The fantasy side of the film is deliberately a little obvious technically, so that when Chitty Chitty Bang Bang flies or floats, in a kind of paper cut-out processing shot, it is just clear enough that what's happening is not real. The jokes and puns are fairly distributed among age levels. There are some subtle, intelligent concessions to a child's view of the absolute, unappeasable arbitrariness of adult power, particularly the habit of replying to an absolutely crucial question, some children, in this case, wanting to know whether they are going to get out of a dungeon or not, ""Well, we'll see.""

There's a lot to like about `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.' It has memorable numbers, staggering production design, and a sense of whimsy that's reflected in its cast. Unfortunately, it takes too long to really get going and prefers showing off what it can do rather than serving the story it's telling. So long as expectations are kept in check, fans of musical fantasies in the vein of Mary Poppins' should enjoy this.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' was shot in spherical 65mm format, but a 70mm for theatrical prints, here called Super Panavision as that company provided the lenses and cameras, but which was basically the same as Todd-AO, the better-known process, at least as Todd-AO existed in the late-1960s. The result is an extremely sharp, steady image along the lines of similar 65mm titles released films. The detail is just incredible, especially in wide shots and tight close-ups, where landscapes and actors' faces, pebbles on a beach, the texture of the costumes and make-ups on the actors, really take on an almost 3D look. Viewers can note the extreme detail given to even the extras' costumes and grotesque make-up and hairstyles, or in Ken Adam's highly imaginative set design.

Blu-ray Audio Video  The Roadshow presentations of `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' were also in six-track magnetic stereo, with fully directional dialogue and superb fidelity that, to my ears at least, home theatre audio still can't quite surpass. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio comes awfully close, however. It's extremely strong for what it is, really maximizing the audio in every scene. The film was preceded by a brief overture, includes an unusual cliff-hanger intermission break, entr'acte, and exit music, all of which are included here.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Sing-Along: The Blu-ray carries over virtually all of the supplements from 2003's two-disc Special Edition DVD starting with a sing-along. As expected, this offers all of the film's musical numbers with accompanying lyrics that change colours so the singer can follow along. In a nice touch, this can be activated on the film itself or one could choose to play only the musical numbers individually or consecutively.

Special Feature: Chitty Chitty's, Bang Bang: Driving Game: The first of the Blu-ray-exclusive is where the player must guide the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car through a path made out to look like a 2D board game. Along the way, the player must avoid hitting obstacles and characters. The gameplay itself is shockingly clunky compared to most Blu-ray games, and to make matters worse, it is over in approximately 60 seconds.

Special Feature: Toot Sweet Toot's Musical Maestro: At six points throughout the film, a selection of coloured candies will emerge at the bottom of the screen. The player must press the corresponding colour keys on their remote in the same order the sweets twirl in. Why this is placed over the feature film six times instead of in an isolated set-top game is anyone's guess. It's boring and offers no treat for successful play.

Special Feature: Remembering `Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' with Dick Van Dyke [2003] [25:58] Showcases a then-current interview with the actor about his experiences making the film. While he lavishes praise on his co-workers and the film itself, he still provides plenty of substantial information. Nearly every musical number he was a part of is given some attention, and he even points out little details to look for in each. While it's a shame Sally Ann Howes and the two actors who played the children weren't interviewed to give this piece a broader perspective, Dick Van Dyke's winning enthusiasm makes the featurette worth a look.

Special Feature: A Fantasmagorical Motorcar [2003] [9:43] looks at the iconic car itself and its owner Pierre Picton. Pierre Picton tells of how he was entrusted with the car's maintenance during production and how he later stumbled upon it once again, purchasing it for himself. He also gives a detailed examination of the car and all of its kooky details. Pierre Picton's anecdotes are interesting, and the showcasing of the car gives one an appreciation for its design.

Special Feature: Sherman Brothers Demos [2003] [30:20] Performed by the Sherman Brothers themselves, whether or not both are present is difficult to tell as only Richard is singing. What makes this particularly unique is that three of the demos are for songs that didn't make it into the film. All are a treat to hear and are surprisingly crisp in quality. Note that during the duration of these songs, a static image of the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car is placed on the screen. While a half-hour may not be enough time to create burn-in on a screen, it's still a little uncomfortable not to have other images in rotation.

Special Feature: Vintage Documentary: The Ditchling Tinkerer [1968] [10:06] You get a trio of promotional clips from the time of the film's release. Focuses on inventor Roland Emmett. Roland Emmett can be credited with the many bizarre contraptions found in the Caractacus Potts home, and he even gives us a closer examination of how these work.

Special Feature: Dick Van Dyke Press Interview [1967] [8:48] Here you have a single-take Q & A between the actor and off-screen journalists whose questions are rather banal and even a little sceptical. While Dick Van Dyke's answers are well thought-out, his mannerisms and expressions throughout the interview make him seem a little tipsy. When one knows of the actor's struggle with alcohol during this time period, it makes for somewhat uneasy viewing.

Special Feature: The Potts Children [3:05] Looks at the child actors Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall. We see them fooling around with the other actors in between takes and even some of their (staged) time exploring the German countryside. Oddly, the children, especially Heather Ripley, sound significantly older in their narration, making one wonder how long the film's post-production process ran.

Special Feature: Photo Gallery: You have a 46-still photo gallery contains various shots from the set, both candid behind-the-scenes and ones shot for promotional purposes.

Vintage Advertising Galleries: Contains the Theatrical Trailer [3:20], a French Theatrical Trailer [3:36] and five TV spots [3:36].

Finally, while perhaps falling short of being a genuine classic, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' remains an absolute cinematic delight, which has been a massive favourite of mine for years. It is definitely recommended for viewers of all ages, but it's absolutely essential viewing for children. The hi-definition image and sound are terrific, making it easy to suggest why you should get this awesome Blu-ray disc and again I am so proud to now have it added to my Blu-ray Collection and if you have not got this in your Blu-ray Collection, then you are missing out on a fantastic treat and it will take you on a fantastic journey and all the extras you get with this Blu-ray disc is totally fascinating and is an added bonus. Highly Recommended!

I threw out the idea of watching this as a joke and they thought the name was hilarious. This was one of those movies I watched as a kid at my grandmas house and I never thought they would like something twice as old as I am, but I was wrong. I grew tired of their indecision and rented Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The kids were unsure of it at first but quickly Loved it! I was shocked. It was long enough that they got two evening tv times out of it, so that part was good. The best part is that it gave them a little perspective to how kids used to live, it was totally alien to them to see kids without tv, tablets, or video games. The like the music and pretty much everything else. The movie made me fall asleep once, and then almost a second time, but they intently watched every minute.

We have had some interesting conversations about why the king of Bulgaria doesn't like children too.  My son also doesn't like when the ""bad guys"" take grandpa so that is a skipped part too but loves that the kids and Chitty save the day in the end.

In my forties, I still think the movie is great, magical, and fantastic but realizing the creators were HIGH! The craziness is more than with Alice in Wonderland...and the name ""Truly Scrumptious"" is as suggestive as any woman's name in a James Bond movie :-).  I say this all in the kindest way possible.  Someone pointed out to me the other day that Disney cartoons and fairy tales always have some element of fear. I have no idea why.

The dad's an inventor who gets breakfast on the table via a contraption that rolls china onto the table with fully cooked eggs and sausage.  Cool!  And that's even BEFORE Chitty Chitty Bang Bang shows up.  Truly Scrumptious is -- God help me -- Truly Scrumptious!  And Dick van Dyke is at his best.  Add Benny Hill (!), Bert Frobe & the divine Anna Quayle to the mix.  My goodness.  It's an embarrassment of riches.  My sister and I adored this movie, year after year, as kids.  I barely remembered the plot at all, beyond the flying car, the catchy bits of the theme song and the fact that there was a candy factory and kids being kidnapped.  It's all still there, and it all still works.

This movie is several notches above Dr. Doolittle, equal with Willy Wonka, and below The Wizard of Oz (our Gold Standard) for the 5+ crowd in our house as well as their grown-up people.

They used to hide behind the couch when the child catcher came to take the children away, but that is the only disturbing scene.... they did the same thing when Nemo was taken away.

The price is amazingly fair and the quality of this item is something to behold. If I could give it a higher rating I certainly would, because I appreciate excellence- you gotta see this!

The audio is excellent as well.  You will be amazed, literally, by the gorgeous, brand-new-looking HD picture quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality.  The sound is perfect, too, just coming out of my HD TV's speakers-- no sound bar is involved.  One of the three best older-film blu-rays, for picture quality, that I own, of over 100 blu-ray titles.  The movie looks about 40 years newer than it is!

I have always loved this film for its timeless children's story, musical numbers, script, and acting.  The picture quality makes it all better still.

It was as entertaining now as when I saw it in the movie theatres as a child. One BIG thi9ng here, however, is that none of the videos I shared with my own children were as sharp and distinct as this HD enhanced version. That, and a 50-inch flat screen sure makes it like the REAL deal at the theatres!

A few caveats:
1) Hope that you never read the original Ian Fleming book, as it has a much different storyline, although it's still about a magical car.  When I first watched the movie, I was disappointed it didn't follow the original story.
2) The lead song is a bit strained as it is hard to rhyme Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.

The kids in the movie and cute and sincere, not obnoxious or sharp-tongued like kids are in many modern movies.  Dick Van Dyke is great, singing and dancing.  He has some really great numbers.  The movie does have its slow moments, i.e., when they sing slow and not-so-memorable songs.  And it was one of the worst bad guys I have seen in a kids movie; I even remember him from when I saw the movie in the theater 40+ years ago!  My son was VERY scared of him.  He wanted to turn it off, but he kept watching and felt much better when the situation improved for the protagonists.  The movie also has some very magical moments, like the scene in the candy factory and when Mr. Potts and Truly Scrumptious dress up like big dolls and entertain the king.

The car is named Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang since its sounds seem to say that.

This is a movie that has pure entertainment value, the chance to just take you away from your current world and transport you into a world of flying cars, singing and dancing, just for fun. Don't look for any socially redeeming value. Just sit back and enjoy the adventure.",1375401600,,620,4.43859649122807

147211,5,0792839129,"They don't make them like that anymore. A real double feature with intermission music and exit music, the first part ending in some catastrophe and the second part starting with the same catastrophe that turns upside down into a miracle. But it is a lot more than that.

This musical is for children and it has all the characteristics that were considered normal in those days, I mean some forty years ago or so. Music of course, nice songs of course, but also the myth of the car, paid for the Ford Corporation or company, and the perfect family with a boy, a girl and a dog, with a grandfather and an unmarried father and of course a beautiful young lady near by.

But the story goes far beyond and during a trip to the beach, the father starts telling a fantastic story that unveils itself as if it were true in the main story. It will be called a dream, it will be called some kind of a tale, fairy tale maybe, and that sounds a lot better than the ""mise en abyme"" of the Hollywood effete snobs. And it is a lot better for children who love stories within stories within stories, and in this case there are probably four or five, one inside the other, that come out like Jacks in the box and open up like Russian dollies, some Matryoshka full of surprise and the whole Bulgarian situation to which the children are captured, the grandfather is deported and the father and his young lady friend are baited and attracted is such a Russian dolly with the village and then the castle and in between several layers of prisons, dungeons and underground inescapable labyrinths.

At each corner of these tunnels and corridors you have more dangers and dangerous soldiers or wardens than you may even count. It is a country where children are forbidden and when there is one or more, they are captured and deported to some concentration camp where they grow away from the sun and adults till they die.

So from pirates we jump to a barbarous king who is a child who has never matured and only wants toys to play with and real soldiers to play war as if they were some tin soldiers. Then the main objective becomes the liberation of the children, of the village and the getting rid of this immature king who should have been institutionalized a long time ago. But in a way, in his own perverse way, he is funny and the tale will catch him up and send him back to real life under the identity of some Wall Street entrepreneur or speculator.

We even forget the whole thing is a love story with the two children choosing their future mother and manipulating their father into marrying her. But do they know what they are doing? They seem to live on what was a norm in those days that a son and a daughter could not grow up if they did not have a father and a mother, without forgetting a dog and a house with a garden. And I forgot: they have to be poor at first and become rich in the end.

It is definitely a precursor or pioneer of both Indian Jones and Back to the Future, though watching it in our modern world is like going back to the past when the dream was a real dream and the fun of the cinema was not competing with the humdrum never ending fun of TV and of course the even worse virtual bath in which we are soaking if not drowning all the time, the Internet and the Cloud. As for flying in the clouds, this car is sure good, as good at least as the car of the Crazy mad scientist of Back to the Future.

My feeling then and now, are pretty much the same : Well made, charming, funny, way over the top in spots; but also extremely derivative, particularly of MARY POPPINS, even in many of the numbers and lots of the songs. Based on a novel by Ian Fleming(yes, the James Bond author), it lacks 'Poppins"" spunk, spirit and creativity. but, it, fortunately has Dick van Dyke and the lovely,""road company Julie Andrews"", Sally Anne Howes.
My granddaughters, 6,7 and 9 loved it, but even they said, ""Its a lot like Mary Poppins"". But there are a lot worse films you could show your kids and even though it gets very long and repetitious in spots, you might enjoy it,too.",1373068800,2,818,4.571428571428571

My favorites are Lionel Jeffries (as Grandpa Potts), Robert Helpmann (as the child catcher), and Anna Quale (as Baroness Bomburst).  The music is great, in spite of what some critics have said (I also have the original soundtrack which I play often).  Caractacus Potts' (Dick Van Dyke) labor saving devices are hilarious (I especially like the hair cutting machine).  The bumbling spies have some of the best lines (""pardon me for protruding."").  There are villains aplenty but the best has to be the child catcher (who owes a great deal of his performance to Margaret Hamilton!).  This film is a joy from start to finish.

As an adult, I discovered the old Dick Van Dyke Show and became a fan of his, and as soon as I realized he was in movies like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins, I wanted to watch his movies. He shined in this movie and became a hero of sort, courting the girl and saving the day, great to root for him versus the bad guys. As a kid, I remembered the car did all sort of magical things, but now realized Chitty Chitty Bang Bang magic was fantasy while Van Dyke is telling a story to the kids. So this isn't exactly like Herbie movies, while Herbie was ""real"" Chitty Chitty Bang never was. This movie has a lot of good songs, and is the best part as this makes it fun to watch over and over.

147264,5,0792839129,"I'm sure I saw this film on TV as a kid in the 70's and I know we watched it on Netflix stream maybe two years ago. But watching the Blu Ray on a decent modern 55"" hdtv is like experiencing a different film. The original was shot on 70mm, and the transfer is absolutely flawless, color is amazing, detail, sound, everything is like watching an actual pristine cut of the film when new. I always thought of this as some old offhand 2nd rate fun kids movie from the 60's, I really had no idea how well made a film this really was. It's nice to see an old treasure rediscovered and given it's proper due finally by the film's owners.

I was expecting some of the effects shots to look pretty bad in HD, but mostly the masking is amazingly well done and it holds up quite well.

It's a surprisingly long movie, and there are some slow-ish scenes like Truly's solo love song, though it is a nice song and beautifully filmed. The songs are all fun and the dance numbers are very well done. Van Dyke is a treasure. And the odd intermission with music only! It was a different era in movie making. But relax, you're not going anywhere. We watched it over two nights.

It's a nice trip down memory lane for adults - though as I say I never saw this film in anywhere near this quality as a kid - and my 4 yo and 2 yo are still singing that song a week later.",1368489600,,1348,4.11787072243346

I finally decided it was too late to return it so I just decided to remove the security stick-on things. The rectangular black security strip came off as usual, but it also had that white square security patch, which is somewhat difficult to remove, but with some time, it comes off. This one did not come off as easily. Still working on it. Not sure if this packaging is only an issue with just mine, NorAm International Partners, Inc. (whom I purchased it from) in general or if there is a general packaging company, but I was very disappointed with how it was packaged.

147412,5,0792839129,"This is a true adventure into the imagination. Pure and simple. It's uncategorical, a fuel burning oracle. For those who've reviewed this film as if they're looking for some kind of truth of life, or life-changing event from a film...grow up, and stop poohing on others' dreams. Movies aren't supposed to give you the answers to the universe; you're supposed to figure that out for yourself. Stop being so lazy. Movies are supposed to be pure escapism. They're intended to entertain you and feed the imagination so that, if you ever do grow up, you don't forget to stop and smell the flowers along your journey, and maybe take a little time to daydream--and that's what Chitty does, with imagination, kooky characters, and song all interposed in one wizardly keen daydream.
  I don't know what the Amazon description means by ""flawed but solid family fare"" as they didn't go into detail about what 'flaws' are held within the film. I found it truly entertaining and extrememly light-hearted fun for kids of any age, and I thumb my nose at anyone so 'old' that they think this is not good film-making. It's exactly what films are supposed to be for. It had an uplifting storyline about a poor inventor realizing his dreams, but who never loses site of the fact that the kids are the most important thing in his world. The songs were wonderful, except for Truly's song about Professsor Potts--and that only because I've never been fond of that high-pitched opera type singing, still, it didn't make me sick.
 And, whenever I get a little upset, I now find myself humming the theme song, or picture Dick Van Dyke doing the 'Old Bamboo' or even sing a little of Grandpa's 'Capitol P.O.S.H. Posh' and go for a walk, ""Port out, starboard home!""  and I instantly feel better.

This is much more satisfying in widescreen because you see all the action and not just 2/3rds of it in some scenes, especially some of the musical numbers.

The choreography is first-rate, and though the plot is a bit weak in places, as a kid's film it works well and is fine family entertainment.

147427,5,0792839129,"This is an excellent transfer to Blu-ray with many, many extra goodies--for the kids and the grownups.
  As I watched Dick Van Dyke dance, the thought came to mind that he had formerly been a dancer and I didn't come to the realization that he was not a dancer until I heard him speak about it himself.  He was fantastic in the dance scene at the fair.  And it wasn't your typical dance scene--it was extremely complex and well done.  That was his best scene in the movie; his other good scenes were when he sang ""Hushabye Mountain"" and played the toy puppet in the castle of Baron Bomburst...a versatile talent.
  Not since the Fred and Rogers film era have such wonderful songs been written for a film; the Sherman brothers wrote some of the best songs/lyrics for the screen since the Gershwins and Berlin.  In my opinion this was the last movie of it's kind...unfortunately.
  Sally Ann Howes was the dessert of the movie--no one else could have been Truly Scrumptious.  Dressed beautifully in white with those curving hips magnifying her femininity from head to toe, and with the voice of a dove, how could Mr. Potts resist her?  My favorite scenes are with her singing ""Lovely, Lonely Man"" and when she's the mechanical automaton atop the music box.  She was amazing--that was a very difficult scene.  She stole the scene with that performance.  She was perhaps one of the very first to do a robotic dance on film. What perplexes me is that she was not nominated for an Oscar for her rendition of ""Lovely, Lonely Man.""  Truly, an unforgettable scene.  She and the song both should have been nominated.
  This wonderful movie reeks with talent and Lionel Jeffries is another reason why--the P-O-S-H scene was made for him and him only.  His presence added spice to the film.
  Gert Frobe and Anna Qualye in their ""coochi"" scene were fantastic...masters of the art.  And Robert Helpmann as the sinister child catcher, was truly dark in his potrayal of this malevolent fiend. His voice and his facial expressions were perfect in their renditions.
  The children were a joy to watch...as kids they did a tremendous job.  Their best scene was when they're on the beach singing to Truly Scrumptious.  Casting did an excellent job on this film.
  Albert Broccoli deserves a lot of credit for going all out on the expense account; one can tell by the actors, costumes, sets etc., that it was extremely expensive but it was all very well worth it.
  A movie with moral songs, sentiments of true love, companionship, and humanity and a type of film that is impossible to find in theatres today.  Today's movies are all special effects without substance.  In contrast, this movie overflows with substance and class.  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang--all the way!

The DVD and Bluray are both widescreen versions of the film, the reason I point this out is Amazon's review system is deeply flawed. All reviews for a movie end up combined together even if the review was for a previous version of the movie.

147447,4,0792839129,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I can not come up with any complaints at all about it.  It looks like a brand new movie shot digiatlly, even better than some I have seen.  It was presented in 2.20:1 aspect ratio, so it wasn't as wide as the normal 2.35:1 widescreen, but still had narrow black bars at the top and bottom.  I feel like I'm missing part of the movie anytime the video isn't wider than my widescreen LCD.

This Blu-Ray has DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio, but there were almost no surround sounds.  At the beginning, before the video was visible, there were race car sounds coming from the rear and side surround speakers (as well as the fronts).  I'm not even sure if this was part of the original movie.  But this beginning was the only real noticable surround sound (I did notice a little sound from the side surrounds, but not much).  So, I really don't understand why they made this in 7.1, since 99% of the sound comes from the fronts and center speakers.

The movie lasted two hours and 24 minutes, which included the intermission.  I don't know why they have an intermission, since you can pause the movie any time you want.",1328054400,,1257,4.4605263157894735

They must have used the best photography filming at that time or they really wanted to show the public a great video quality transfer.

The story shows the heights to which imagination can soar, while entertwining with the more mundane tale of the characters' lives.  I love the family connection, the fun music and silliness of the characters.

(Opening titles/prologue alone are over 10 min. long) Due to the film's length, children may have to view it in 2 parts. (Not a problem with DVD.)

Dick Van Dyke is in rare form.  In my opinion, even better than his performance in Mary Poppins. Lionel Jeffries is hilarious and Gert Frobe (Auric Goldfinger from 007) is surprisingly funny. The special effects on the car are quite clever.  The flying scenes look a bit fake, but in 1968, digital and motion-capture weren't yet invented!

This, amongst other reasons, is why the UK made Widescreen standard in 1999 - and since all television shows produced in the UK were produced in Widescreen 16:9. Due to the switch to Widescreen all DVD's were released in their intended aspect ratio, in this case 2.20:1. Sure there was black bars on the top and bottom but that was because the 2.20:1 was too large to fit on a 16:9 display - and for Americans with their 4:3 displays letter boxing became an issue because most didn't like seeing the bars and would rather loose information rather than see the whole picture.",1311897600,2,745,4.518518518518518

Oh, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" I remember being babysat by my Nanu (my name for my grandmother) with my sisters and being plopped in front of the TV to watch this movie on several occasions. At the time, I thought it was the best movie EVER. Watching it now is still nostalgic, but I can't help but notice how....long it is. It's like two and a half hours long! Still the music, the dancing, the colors, and the imagination are all a pleasure.

Dick Van Dyke stars as Caractacus Potts who is a bit of a crack pot. He home schools his two children and lives the life of a dreamer and is a great inventor. After a failed turn with ""toot sweets"" (candies that double as whistles), he manages to invent the most amazing car ever that can fly and float where needed. Sally Ann Howes plays Truly Scrumptious who ends up falling in love with Potts and his family as they take a ride into a magical world of castles, pirates, and musical adventure. Lionel Jeffries plays Caractacus's even more eccentric father (In real life, Jeffries was four years younger than Dick Van Dyke, but was prematurely bald and looked the part.) who is kidnapped and mistaken for the great inventor who could possibly make a new Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the bad guys.

While at the beach, storytelling begins and imaginations get the best of everyone as they are all sucked into the story. There are tons of hits from the dancing in ""The Old Bamboo"" to ""Toot Sweets"" to the children singing to ""Truly Scrumptious"" and father and children singing to each other in ""I Have You Two."" Then there's the classic ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" which begins with the car itself making the noises and turning it into a tribute to the vehicle.

It's a huge production, very colorful and a classic for children. Dick Van Dyke talks about in the extras how this type of innocence has been lost in today's children's movies, but how children need it. I can easily imagine kids today being impatient with it, but it is still magical and I hope future kids can still dream of ""Hushabye Mountain.""

Bonus Features:

There's a sing-along on both the DVD and the Blu-ray so you can sing-along as the movie plays. In ""Remembering Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" with Dick Van Dyke, he talks about the experience and the difficulty of learning the dance numbers and how after he didn't warm up before one performance, he ended up tearing the muscle at the back of his leg and was off dancing for six weeks. He loved working with Sally Ann Howes who was graceful, beautiful, and had a gorgeous voice. He reveals the man who played his father was younger than him and how they changed the story of the pirates from actually happening to becoming a fantasy so they could go as far as they wanted. He talks about working with Benny Hill, the king who was from ""Goldfinger"", and how the graceful dancing of the child-catcher helped him avoid injury with his entire cart tipped over end over end. Dick Van Dyke's life dream was to be the Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"" so the part was written for him to be the puppet life-size toy so he could explore his love for pantomime and talks about the whole number as one of the best numbers the Sherman brothers ever did.

Pierre Picton owns the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang motor car number 11 and leads the featurette, ""A Fantasmagorical Motorcar"". His car was used during the film to fall to pieces and while he was there, they asked him to be caretaker to the other Chitty Chittys during production. He ended up buying two more and has taken them around the world for others to see. He takes you through the parts on the car and the cleaning process so she can really gleam. The body has some real shiny wood, brass, and the red leather seats make it VERY classy and turn heads. He points out all the levers for refreshments, the letter box, the dials that show how high you are flying, and he pulls out the wings for full effect.

In using the ""Music Machine"" featurette, you can just skip ahead to your favorite musical numbers. ""Toot Sweets Toots Musical Maestro"" is a feature you can turn on during the movie where six times throughout the film, a candy contraption will appear with a bunch of candies on it that will move to the music. You have to remember the order and then use the red, blue, yellow, and green buttons on your Blu-ray remote to enter the same pattern as fast as you can. Huh. I never knew those buttons had a purpose till now, obviously I should have known they were for candy memory games.

The Sherman Brothers' demos are included with some simple voices accompanied by piano to paint the picture of what they wished to achieve in planning the film. There are also galleries of photos and vintage advertising and vintage featurettes. The vintage featurettes are old indeed showing another tinkerer who likes to take items around the house and make them into something new.

There is also a cute High-definition game you can play with the arrows on your remote where you carefully ""drive"" Chitty Chitty Bang Bang through a series of obstacles first on the road and then in the sky! It's pretty easy, but looks really cool.",1291852800,5,5183,4.515991471215352

I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was young and I had decided to buy it for my little one for her movie collection.  She is just two years old and she sat through the entire movie with me, dancing and singing!  She loved every minute of it!  I hope everyone enjoys this movie as much as we do!",1291680000,,404,4.075949367088608
147489,5,0792839129,"This is a Super Panavision movie of the late 1960's. Its former VHS incarnation produced a completely washed out full frame picture, concurrently with a highly distorted soundtrack. It got significantly better in the DVD edition (sound issues were all gone), but in the new Blu-Ray version the image is beyond reprehension, and the sound benefited from a new lossless audio track.

Although it was not evident, it seems that CCBB was subjected to the full Lowry Digital treatment, which normally produces a state-of-the-art 4K resolution, with a consistent colour throughout the movie. It is the dream of the movie collector and it will surely be of interest to the occasional or to the film fan. Highly recommended!",1291420800,8,716,5.067796610169491
147490,5,0792839129,"Most people have seen CCBB so this review is mostly about the quality of the remastered Blu-ray. This cut is far better then most new movies that are released on Blu-ray. They did it right. The opening scene of the different grand prix races I give a 9 out of 10 only because it was meant to look old because it is the history of where CCBB came from. Once the story starts after the opening credits/races I was blown away at the clarity and detail. This is a most own.
Of course the movie and music is fun and entertaining as well. I watched this movie with a group of friends. There was a teenager that was not thrilled about watching a musical, but I was told she sang the songs in the car ride home. Personnally I think if there were more movies like this, we would have less problems in this world.

147492,5,0792839129,"Little prepares you for the print on this - it's simply extraordinary.

It's been frame-by-frame restored using the Lowry Digital Restoration Process which was used on all 20 of the Bond films, the three Godfather movies, the original Star Wars Trilogy, the Indiana Jones films and even the transfer of Avatar (all to much acclaim).

But this 2010 Blu Ray/DVD Combination pack reissue of 1968's ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" has to be a benchmark - even for them.

After the excellent 2DVD set issued a few years back, I didn't think that much more improvement could be wrenched out of the negative, but it has been. This transfer is practically faultless - BEAUTIFUL to look at for the whole duration of the movie. Directed with style and flair by Ken Hughes and filmed in 70mm Super Panavision Technicolor - it's a sumptuous feast of colours - you see their period clothes anew, the details in the inventions inside Caractacus Pott's hillside home, the uncluttered English countryside, the Scrumptious Sweet Factory, the seaside scenes, the two bumbling spies, the toy dance at the King's Birthday Party in the Palace where their love shines out and almost gets them caught - all of it - gorgeous to look at. There's old and 'New Extras' also...

Sally Ann Howes looks suitably wholesome and lovely, Dick Van Dyke is as likeable as ever (a much underrated leading man) and the songs are excellent if not a little twee in places. The quirks of Sixties movies remain intact too - the patience-sapping Overture at the beginning where a black screen sits there with only the roaring of car engines before the picture finally appears - the ""Intermission"" break in the middle (so you could go and buy sweets) where Chitty goes over the cliff-edge and you don't find out what happens until the film starts up again and you're back in your seats - all there - as it was in the cinema - and the original aspect retained too.

The child-catcher is still the scariest monster ever created in cinema (with Benny Hill being strangely creepy too) and the interplay between Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle as the bickering King and Queen of Vulgaria is still pricelessly funny. All this and Stanley Unwin speaking ""...horribold..."" English to Lionel Jeffries - which always makes me pine for The Small Faces 1967 album masterpiece 'Ogden's Nutgone Flake' (he spoke in between tracks on Side 2).

Sure it'll be too saccharine for our ""Call Of Duty"" teenagers to enjoy nowadays, but there's something timeless and lovely about this 'magical car' movie - and that beautifully evocative ""Hushabye Mountain"" melody always renders me a quivering mush whenever I hear it.

This 2010 BLU RAY of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a superlative reissue of a family classic. Ian Fleming would indeed be shaken - and possibly even stirred.

Recommended like a duet with the wife on ""Chu-Chi Face"".

147495,5,0792839129,"A family movie from the 1960s that is musical, magical, and mystifying. It grabs your senses using real people, prior to all the animation of today's films. Now--HOW CAN IT BE?--it is even BETTER. If there was a movie destined for Blu-Ray, this would be one. Double Chitty luck for those who own the right players and big screen TVs.

Dick Van Dyke as Potts, an inventor extroidnaire, but with inventions more likely to fail than succeed. Van Dyke is not the only huge player. Benny Hill is Potts' father, in a descent sort of way. Lovely Sally Ann Howes appears for glamour but is excellent in her role. Of course it is the castle scenery, the car invention, pirates and so much more that make this a grand story for all ages, and a pure delight on a big screen with Blu-Ray. It's humor, suspense, sweetness, and glorious music and songs that will reconnect with new generations now.

I was in college when this movie first ran. Now I buy for my grandchildren. They love it! Nothing quite like this is doable today. This show will never become outdated, especially since technology finds new ways to improve.

Final endorsements come from two song titles which you and the kids will be singing for days/weeks. This DVD is ""Toot Sweet"", & ""Truly Scrumptious"".",1288742400,,1259,4.63677130044843

147504,5,0792839129,"I have to imagine this screenplay and some songs were pitched to Disney for a live-action production (or perhaps one that mixed in animation, like 'Mary Poppins' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks'), but most likely Disney balked at the high price. The critical reaction to this film upon release in the US was to quite an extent negative. But I loved it as a child and I still love it. Here is why:

1. It integrates fantasy, some of it a bit scary, into real outdoor settings--instead of the matte paintings, animation, and Hollywood sets that Disney used.
2. That car. It's the most beautiful old car you will ever see in a film except perhaps the one in 'The Reivers' (from about the same time period in film making too).
3. Dick van Dyke. He gets a real lead role in a musical romance. He could sing, he could really really dance, and he could act.
4. Sally Ann Howes never got the fame of Julie Andrews, but she is a better singer and actor, with more screen presence and warmth.
5. This film is an adaptation of an Ian Fleming story. Fleming's book is a nice piece of whimsy for children, but this film's screenplay marries that whimsy to a much more elaborate plot, one Roald Dahl helped concoct (and he knew how to keep children's stories interesting for children and adults).

This, along with Willy Wonka, are two films that outdid Disney, even if the American critical reception was mixed. They just didn't get it. But audiences did, which is why this film and Willy Wonka are holiday classics.",1263945600,3,1501,4.535055350553505

Along with just about everyone else anywhere near my age (I was born in 1966), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (not ""Charlie &..."" the Tim Burton remake) were the cinematic musical fantasy twin pillars of my early childhood. As such, they enjoy can do no wrong status in my lights. While I originally watched them with the uncritical eyes of a very young child, I must admit that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang suffers the most of the two from reviewing as an adult, crossing the line into twee treacle near the beginning and infantile silliness near the end, which Willy Wonka never does. Still (and I know this is self-contradictory) the film will remain forever perfect for those of us who first encountered it When We Were Very Young. (With the notable exception of the unbearable musical number ""Lovely Lonely Man"", which always has served as a room clearing test of willpower for any viewer. Hated it then, hate it now. If you can make it through that song, the rest is golden. Never in my life have I ever met anyone who goes around humming Lovely, Lonely Man, which is something I can't say for any of the other songs in the film.)

That being said, for the love of all that is holy, do yourself a favor and do not purchase the full screen version of this film. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a widescreen film that makes continuous use of the full widescreen picture plane, so watching the pan & scan version is an exercise in deep frustration, especially (but not only) for those of us who are very familiar with the film. The only reason I purchased the full screen disc way back when it was first released, was that it was the only version available, and my deep seated love for the film overcame my equally deep seated hatred of pan & scan. Fortunately, now there is a widescreen version available:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang-Special-Edition/dp/B0000C2IQD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;That's always the way to go, but particularly with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.",1261267200,3,2672,5.779187817258883

147521,5,0792839129,"Ever since I was a child, musicals have always caught my attention.  Not the animated Disney kinds, although those are excellent in their own manner, but ones with real people bursting into song and dancing their hearts out.  My first musical was 'Mary Poppins,' which also starred Dick Van Dyke, and I have been hooked since.

Set in England, Van Dyke plays the loving father to twins, a boy and girl, as well as being a somewhat bumbling inventor.  His portrayal and connection with the children is heart-warming, charming, and all-around winning--he can sing and dance exceptionally well!  Sally Howles, his radiant co-star, portrays Truly Scrumptious, who suits her rather unusual name perfectly--like Van Dyke, she is charming with a tongue-in-cheek kind of humor and primness that is all too endearing.

The story takes place before Van Dyke's character pleases his children in purchasing their 'toy' car (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang)--including the means he goes to get the money--and the imaginative story he tells that takes up most of the movie where an evil baron will go to any means of getting the car.

What a great flick, and one that I love sharing with my own children (ages 2 and 4).  Growing up in the 70's the only time to see this movie was on Thanksgiving, and if you missed it..., you were out of luck until the next year.

The story of inventor Caractacus Potts, his children Jemima and Jeremy, and Truly Scrumptious may be a bit syrupy for modern tastes, and in truth the special effects are not up to snuff for a world grown accustomed to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Still, I wanted to believe a car could fly or turn into a boat, and that fairy-tale castles truly were just across the ocean, if only we could go there.

Today's kids movies don't quite have the same sense of magic and wonder as this one.  So do yourself a favor, suspend your disbelief, and believe that a car can fly!

Dick Van Dyke stars as the zany inventor Caractacus Potts; with lovely Sally Ann Howes as the aptly-named Truly Scrumptious.  The story blends elements of reality and fantasy as the Potts family enjoys a colourful adventure aboard their ""fantasmagorical"" motorcar, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

The beautiful musical score provided by Richard & Robert Sherman (""Mary Poppins"", ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"", ""The Slipper and the Rose"" and ""The Happiest Millionaire""), perfectly sets the tone for every character and plot-point.

This movie has some funny moments but it drags in a lot of scenes. For example, in the candy factory, they sang for a long long time, at least more than 10 minutes. That distracted me from the story. The director seemed to concentrate more to the music and dancing than the plot.

Good songs by the same Sherman brothers who wrote the songs of ""Mary Poppins"". Same dance choreographer from ""Mary Poppins"". Based on the novel by Ian Fleming, a real life secret agent in World War II. Movie script by Ronald Dahl, who wrote ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Dick Van Dyke, and an all-star cast, though many unknowns. A very creative real-life inventor created the interesting inventions. A lot of bright, talented, people came together for this film. Too bad they can't make them like this anymore.

I bought this Special Edition for the second disc with the behind-the-scenes. An interesting look at the real life inventor behind the interesting inventions. I also enjoyed the interview with Dick Van Dyke.

I also bought the other full-screen edition, for the better, natural picture quality. It is not a big difference. Full-screen edition does not have the behind-the-scenes.

The producer of James Bond films gave the Disney team a free hand, but could not restrain himself from interjecting one risque' singing scene with a scantily clad baroness. However, the focus of the scene is humor and a good song. It is a great duet, with some great melodramatic acting. Though the scene would have been better with a modestly dressed baroness.

147579,5,0792839129,"This is a wonderful film for small children, and adults will be pleasantly surprised by how little it has dated.

I saw this film as a small child when it first came out and loved it.

Recently I was reminded how good the music of the film was when I happened apon the song ""The Roses of Success"" on the internet, and my two five-year old children appeared in my office in ten seconds flat to see what Daddy was listening to. So I thought I would get them the DVD.

This DVD has held the twins' attention for several playings. They are listening to it as I write and it has finally taken them out of their mother's hair after an afternoon in which they had been driving her, and consequently me, to distraction. The acting was brilliant, the special effects had dated far less than is usual for a film of this vintage, and the music was as good as I had remembered.

The orignal books were written by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, and were quite dark in tone. The film version is a light musical comedy.

Dick van Dyke plays Caractacus Potts, a poverty stricken inventor, and a widower with two small children. He buys and rebuilds a famous former racing car, which his children name Chitty Chitty Bang Bang after the distinctive noise made by the car's exhaust. (If a forty year old memory of reading the books as a child is accurate, Fleming put a note in the books to the effect that there really had been a famous racing car which had this nickname.)

The Potts family meet Truly Scruptious (Sally Ann Howes) daughter of the local sweet magnate Lord Scruptious (James Robertson Justice.) After they get off to a bad start, she tries to help Caractacus Potts raise the money to restore the car. After initial plans to raise money fall through, Caractacus gets the necessary funds by pure chance.

Restoration completed, Caractacus takes his children to the beach and again they join up with Truly Scrumptious. He tells his children an imaginary story about a wicked foreign potentate, Baron Bomburst (Gert Frobe) with a wife who hates children (Anna Quayle). The Baron wants to steal this wonderful car - a car which can turn into a boat, and also fly. His agents first try to steal the car, then kidnapp Caractacus's father Grandpa Potts (Lionel Jeffries). The viewer is caught up in the story.

Most people will know the ending but I'm not going to give it away for those who don't.

Excellent performances from van Dyke, Howes (was she really 38 years old when this was made?), Lionel Jeffries and James Robertson Justice. Other cast members included Benny Hill (""The Toymaker""), Max Wall, and Barbara Windsor (her character is called simply ""Blonde"" - I think this was made before she became famous in the Carry On films). Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes did the screenplay.

Perhaps the most memorable part of the film is Richard M Sherman's wonderful music and lyrics.",1174176000,,2881,4.598440545808967

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  Caractacus Potts is a widower trying to provide for his two children, by

invented wacky inventions he hopes to sell and patent. When the kids plead

with him to save an old racing car (which is their plaything) from an unscrupulous junk dealer who wants to melt down for scrap metal, Potts has to come up with 30 shellings. During an outing at the local carnival, he brings one of his inventions, a haircutting machine, hope to earn the money. However, when it inadvertenly destroys a man's head of hair, he runs for his life, seeking refuge with a dance troupe. He does so well in the song and number, the crowd starts to throw money at him and his giving more by the leader of the troupe. Potts finally buys the car, and over a period of time turns it into a glorious car--Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

  Both movies:

(1)Are based on stories written by Ian Fleming.

(2)Feature a villain by Gert Frobe as Baron Bomburst and Auric Goldfinger.

(3)Have the hero using a gadget car, Chitty and an Aston Martin DB5.

(4)Were produced by Albert R. Broccoili.

(5)Had Ken Adam for the production desinger.

(5)Include Desmond Llewelyn, who plays the recurring Bond character Q; he

appears in ""CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG"" as Coggins, the junk dealer.

(6)Were released by United Artists.

(7)Author Roald Dahl wrote the screenplays for both ""CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG"" and another Bond film ""YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.""",1170892800,,2815,5.971279373368146

Sally Anne Howes is lovely.  I agree with the reviewer that the film is about 20 minutes too long, but that's my only real criticism of it.

147592,5,0792839129,"This is one of my favorite movies from childhood.

The movie stars Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes,Lionel Jeffries and Benny Hill. The plot centers around a very talented but nere do well mechanical engineer/widower named Caractacuss Potts, his two children Jeremay and Jemimah,his father and Truly Scrumptious, the daughter of the local candy baron. Caractacuss invents a candy called ""Toot Sweets"" which after much encouragement from Truly he presents to the local candy baron,Lord Scrumptious. However he ends up blowing the deal as the candy literally goes to the dogs by calling them into the candy factory. Caractacuss feeling as a failure purchases a once famous race car from Mr. Coggins the local junk man and transforms it into the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, named so because this is the sound the engine makes. The Potts family along with Truly go to the seaside for a picnic where Caractacuss spins a tale of the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and her encounter with the evil Baron of Vulgaria and her ulitmate triumph in liberating the country and her people. The musical score is brillant from the Sherman Brothers. My favorite song is when Lionel Jeffries sings the song ""Posh"" while being transported in his ""hut"" in midair. Benny Hill is a riot as the toy maker. This movie is great fun for the entire family!",1166054400,,1330,4.859030837004405

147594,4,0792839129,"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" has the unique position in my life as being the first movie I saw in the cinema. When I was 3 or 4 or whenever I saw it, I believed I loved it. My vague memories are wonderful. Now, watching again at age 40, in 2006, it does not carry over well.

Why?

It was probably no help to watch the much superior ""Mary Poppins"" just before. Dick Van Dyke is a great character actor, with a range of skills that make him the perfect clown actor. However, unlike in ""Mary Poppins,"" he was not given the right materials.

His female co-lead is weak - Sally Ann Howes is no Julie Andrews. The children actors could not have been more bland. The plot was hard to follow, even as an adult.

There is one catchy song played too often, based on the onomonopoeticism of the sound the car made while rumbling down the road. Had there been more up tempo songs, or wittier lyrics, I think the movie would have twice the staying power. The other songs sound too close to lullabies.

So why it is so popular, and why do I still give it four stars? I'm sentimental perhaps, Dick Van Dyke is so good at doing that Dick Van Dyke thing, or I still find the idea of a car that can fly, float, and look retro-cool fascinating. James Bond would have loved the car, and, why not? Ian Fleming, Bond's creator, wrote the book upon which the movie is based.

The premise is that a well-meaning, hardworking inventor played by Van Dyke, single parents two pretty good kids who help push him forward in life. The kids, by force of accident, introduce him to candy heiress Truly Scrumptious. Although they start off awkwardly, the two quickly treat the children to a fantasy of a kingdom without children, flying buildings, international espionage, and romance.

For me, the difficulty was that the plot flowed in and out of fantasy. Knowing which was which was hard, and when the ending finally comes around, it seemed as if the worlds became one. I felt confused.

Did I like the movie? Yes. If I were shopping for a sweet children's movie, and I wanted something with more classic values, I would consider ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" It would not be the first DVD I picked up, but it would be a far better choice than the latest toy-based Saturday morning cartoon series.

No disrespect to the people who love it, it has it's moments of fun and is a rare family movie.  But to me it's a cloyingly sweet, over-the-top, Hollywoodized perversion of a great children's novel.  Oddly enough, Ian Fleming had a great innate understanding of children of Jeremy and Jemima's age and he treats their characters with a respect lacking in most adult novels about children.  In contrast, the movie is absolutely condescending to children, as bad as the nightmare babysitter who knew how to sweet-talk your parents but you could absolutely see through.  For those of you who love the movie, watch it in good health.  For those of you who can't hack the syrupy celluoid, find the original novel (I found a nice bound version through a used/rare bookseller site - take notice, Amazon) and read it together with your child.

The songs are great. I can listen to Hushabye Mountain and Ol Bamboo a hundred times. But let's not forget the title song ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". A catchy tune that the kids will bug you with for weeks. After I got this DVD and the kids had watched it for awhile, everytime we got in the car they would sing it. Cute at first but wore on the ears after the first dozen times.

The stroyline is sound, basically a fairytale told at the beach. If you are ever to watch this, you need to watch the dvd or vhs. Don't waste your time with regular tv, they cut way too much out.

147605,5,0792839129,"What can I say- I just love this film. I had it on video and almost wore away the tape from repeated watchings! I bought the Collectors Edition DVD set complete with Chitty car and double dvd discs. This is a fantastic journey through an adventure. Crisp picture quality and sound allowed me to see the film through new eyes. The songs are fantastic; my favourite being Doll On A Music Box as its my favourite scene in the whole film because of the sheer brilliance of Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes' convincing portrayal of toys. The childcatcher still scares me everytime he says Come and Get Your Lollipops. I tried to explain this to my class, who have never seen the film. They're in for a treat at the end of term when I put it onto the interactive whiteboard with surround sound. Despite the 1968 style special effects, which were fantastic by those standards, you get sucked into the world of Chitty. I always wanted to be Truly Scrumptious when I was little. Seeing this again has reminded me of fond childhood memories. I've watched it over four times in one week because I've noticed things in the widescreen version that I didn't have on VHS- such as Sally Ann Howes smacking Dick Van DYke into the mirror during the music box scene. I also find the two spies much funnier now. Gert Frobe as Baron Bombhurst adds hilarity and I remember Anna Quayle more for her part as Mrs Monroe in Grange Hill rather than the Baroness in Chitty. Their scene for Chu-chi Face is quite sado-masochistic as an adult watcher of the film. Children would not get the undertones of the darkness of their relationship! All in all, I would have loved to have seen the wedding between Truly and Caractacus but as the film is long enough, the immortal lines ""Well Mr Potts, now we'll have to get married!"" will have to do and leave the rest to imagination. Just one gripe- Sally Ann Howes should have been given much more to do- her voice is a stunner. Much as many people have claimed that there wasn't much chemistry between her and Van Dyke- I beg to differ. On widescreen you notice that there is a smouldering chemistry by small facial expressions. The kids were great too! Oh, and I didn't realise that beach was in St Tropez.

147607,4,0792839129,"In 1968, United Artists released the classic family-oriented musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. At the time, mixed reviews and poor box office returns could relegated it to obscurity. However, instead, over the years, despite a very cliched storyline, special effects about ten years behind the times, and songs that can't exactly hold their own with those from the major hits of the box office, the film has become a childhood classic thanks to the fact that it's a genuinely fun film.

Chitty's inagural DVD release in 1998 was a bland full-screen only release with practically no bonus features. In 2003, however, MGM finally decided to give Chitty her shining moment on the DVD shelf with a loaded 2-Disc Special Edition, just in time for her 35th Anniversary.

Disc 1 is a double-sided disc. Both sides are identical with the exception of the movie. Side 1 contains a 16x9 widescreen transfer, while side 2 contains a fullscreen transfer, which is sure to please both people like me who prefer widescreen as well as people who prefer fullscreen. Both brand new high-definition transfers have been restored and remastered and look better than ever, despite some occasional anomalies, such as flickering and shakiness/jumpiness, especially during the opening credits. The 5.1 digital soundtrack is also the best this film has ever sounded.

Disc 2 contains a nice selection of bonus materials. Two new featurettes are the main attraction. One is a new interview with Dick Van Dyke on the making of the film, while the other is about Chitty herself. Vintage featurettes, trailers (Including one from France!) and TV spots, games, and a good photo gallery are also included. However, the big surprise in this package would be 14 demos performed by Richard Sherman, with intros explaining the songs. Most of them are simply demos of songs that made it to the film, some with alternate lyrics. However, there are demos of two deleted songs which remain in the film as underscore, as well as a deleted reprise of Lovely Lonely Man to be performed by Caratacus Potts. It's just a shame these demos weren't also included on the excellent CD soundtrack. I must take off a star, however, because I'm disappointed with the lack of real MEATY making-of materials, as opposed to JUST two fluffy documentaries and fluffy vintage featurettes. A good making-of with interviews with more of the surviving actors and the Sherman brothers would have been nice - something that also acknowledges the fact that the film was not as well recieved upon its initial release as it is today. An audio commentary also would have been a nice addition.

MGM did not skimp, however, on the quality of the packaging, something I felt Varese Sarabande did with the soundtrack. *No lyrics, only an essay.* Packaged inside a gorgeous slipcover that opens like a book to list the DVD materials and a map of the locations from the movie, a digipack opens up to display both discs and a gorgeous 34-page storybook overflowing with gorgeous pictures from the movie.

With all its flaws, I still wholeheartedly recommend this DVD for any Chitty fan simply for the gorgeous presentation of the film. If you own the original fullscreen DVD, throw it out and replace it with this excellent DVD presentation. You get your choice of widescreen and fullscreen presentations, a brand new high definition restored and remastered audio and video transfer, and a whole disc of bonus materials.",1147824000,5,3445,4.973958333333333

147616,4,0792839129,"I just revisited my own childhood (to a degree) by watching this splendid DVD version of Ian Flemings once revered Musical/Family drama. This represents a time when wholesome just didn't refer to exotic bread from the local health store, but solid, morally grounded family fun. The story is essentially simple; The car of the title is a former Grand Prix winner now rusting in an English Junkyard circa 1930's, and now resigned to a plaything for two impoversihed local children. These children belong to Dick Van Dyke as good hearted but unrealistically wacky inventor Caractacus Potts, who lives in a windmill with the children and their grandfather. Along comes local Confectionary heiress Truly Scrumptous (yes great name) and adds to the mix for some adventurous escapades with the car, which is undergoing a cosmetic revamping by the aforementioned Potts. Everything is here in the right quantity for a balanced family musical, of the kind sadly seldom seen today. Arguably the car, which is magic, can fly, sail on the ocean, and never look used, is the star, but the real power of the movie lies in simple but excellent script direction, and character portrayal. Evil German Barons, a Fairytale castle, lush English meadows and some other excellent locations weave the tapestry as we watch and the end result is sheer joy. Although some may find the special effects a little obvious by todays standards, the film has more than stood the test of time, and will I feel continue to enthrall and entertain each successive generation.

The story takes place in the British country side, where races are held every so often. Two children, Jeremy and Jemima (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), would play in the junkyard with the worn down cars. There they meet a lady named Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes) who wants to meet the childrens' parents. She drives Jeremy and Jemima over to the house with the windmill, where she meets Caratacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins, Diagnosis Murder), an inventor whose inventions goe awry. The two meet and argue for some time. Potts always has time for his children, even when his inventions don't go the way he planned. His father, (Lionel Jefferies), encourages him to give up his inventions, and start living in reality. Potts considers this, until his dog, Edison, gives him an idea of a new candy: toot sweets. A candy that toots like a flute. The next day, he sends his invention to Lord Scrumptious (James Robertson Justice), head of a large candy factory. He approves of this candy, until the whistle sounds sends a pack of dogs into the factory, and Scrumptious rejects it. Saddened by this, Jeremy and Jemima try to comfort their father by willing to give up their most precious possessions so that Potts can buy the car the children were trying to save from the junkyard. Potts appreciates this, but couldn't take them. He reassures them that he will find a way to make money, 30 shillings, to be exact, and he does! He sends his latest invention, a hair styling machine, to the fair that's being held in town. But once again, his invention goes awry, and a chase from an angry customer leads Potts to a dancing act he performs in, and in the end, earns him enough money to buy the car for his children. Jeremy and Jemima are excited, and can't wait to see what their father does to fix the car. What will happen to the car? Will Potts and Truly ever get along? Is this the ultimate adventure for everyone?

This film has great dancing, choreographed by the choreographers of Mary Poppins. It simply makes me want to dance along with them! It also has great songs by the same songwriting team of Mary Poppins, The Parent Trap, The Jungle Book, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Charlotte's Web, Snoopy Come Home, Little Nemo, and many more great classics, Robert B.

147623,4,0792839129,"This film followed the recipe of the highly successful Mary Poppins, including the same songwriters (the Shermans) and the same cast (Dick Van Dyke).  Although it's a fun film, it does not really measure up to its prototype.

The film has Disney-fied the charmingly eccentric family of Caractacus Potts, a wacky inventor who lives in a dilapidated windmill.  In the book (believe it or not, by Ian Fleming, the writer of the James Bond books), Caractacus is truly and humorously eccentric, but Dick Van Dyke as Potts plays the part pretty much as as a Wonderbread romantic lead: all Caractacus' odd behaviors are pretty much erased, and with it a lot of the fun of the book.  In 1968 I wanted to be his love interest, Miss Truly Scrumptious, an heiress with both a spunky attitude and lovely clothes, but in 2004 I wish she's been given more to do.

Finally, there is such a thing as a song being TOO singable - the title song - the heroine's song ""Truly Scrumptious"" - are so melodic they are unforgettable, although  you are likely to wish you could get them out of your head.

I remember really liking this one when I was a kid, although it does not hold up as well as Mary Poppins herself. Nevertheless, watching it with small children was an entertaining evening at home.",1105920000,,1276,4.5701754385964914
147624,4,0792839129,"I bought the ""cheap"" DVD, because little kids don't care about wide-screen or interviews or extras.  They like color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs.  The next day, the girl (5) asked me to play specific scenes:  the song ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and the ""dancing dolls"" routine.  She even liked the name ""Truly Scrumptious"".  The only problem with small children is ""Why ..."" and ""How ..."" every few minutes.  I wasn't sure at first if the adventures in Vulgaria were part of the fantasy story or ""real"", so I just kept saying, ""It's magic"".  Later, we pretended my Outback could float and fly.

As for me?  I'm a big fan of Dick Van Dyke, so I kind of enjoyed it -- and having never watched films on DVD until recently, I guess I liked the color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs.  How about that?",1103155200,6,834,4.6506849315068495

147626,5,0792839129,"Heralded as a family favorite upon its release, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" delivers the appropriate subliminal musical tone that draws and cements the images of Icarus into the minds of children. This film could very well prevent Guajardian visions in the budding minds of children, who will no doubt grow up with shocking and pessimistic myths and legends in various comparative literature classes.

This film takes the myth of the flight of Icarus, but demolishes the bummer quotient. Dick Van Dyke, in control of the industrial age wings-of-wax, instead rides toward the sun without fear of CCBB's tires melting; and even if they do, the joke is on the sun, because you don't need wheels to fly! And when the family floating in the car sings about how much they love their artisan miracle, the flawed Icarus tale finally has the merry ending that the masses have, for centuries, cried out for!",1097193600,5,895,4.8881578947368425
147627,4,0792839129,"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a real challenge. The problem with the film lies in the title song, which is probably the least inspired musical effort in the Canon of Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman. Just saying ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a mouthful, but having to hear it performed SEVEN times during this film is taxing.

 But once you get over the redundancy of that, you'll find a fine story performed by a wonderful cast. Dick Van Dyke turns in his typically wonderous work as the Crack Pot inventor Caractacus Potts, and Sally Ann Howes as Ian Fleming's Bond Girl named ""Truly Scrumptious,"" his rival, then love interest.

 But for kids it's all about the car that can fly in the air and sail on the sea. For a film made in the late 1960s, the special effects are remarkable, and the film is shot beautifully.

 This DVD package is especially good because you get a bonus disc with some very interesting featurettes, including a press conference style interview with Van Dyke who had just started filming on location in Great Britain and other bits including a documentary piece on all of the Potts ""inventions"" for the film and an interview with the guy who is the caretaker of the film's famous vehicle.

 Overall, the movie may not be quite as good as ""Mary Poppins,"" but it's right there with ""Willy Wonka!""

""Why issue a classic widescreen epic on DVD if you are not going to present it in its original aspect ratio?"" That was my original question along with many many more fans as this Ian Fleming tale. Count Zborowski is no longer as disapointed about this DVD as he must have been when he lost the original Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang in 1922. This is an outstanding DVD presentation with pleny of extras for the young and old alike.",1087862400,5,517,4.395833333333333
147630,3,0792839129,"Please read this review to the end, because it discusses several important highs AND lows about this DVD package.  It'd be unfortunate & unbalanced, if you only got half the picture.
1)  The main DVD (1 of 2) has the widescreen version of the film on one side, and the TV-square version on the other side.  This format makes SO much sense, and is good value for the customer.
2)  Disney, which usually overloads their VHS video and DVDs with ads, and shovels them at you BEFORE the main feature, has let their ads sit in the PROPER place, this time-- under ""extras"" in the DVD menu.  There are LOTS of extras-- a kids' book built-in on the DVD case, and some slightly puffy ad-interviews... but generally satisying despite the happy-happy-joy-joy quality of the interviews.
3) If my copy is typical, then the plastic Disney used in the DVD is substandard.  My copy of the DVD has no other signs of heavy use, but already has a PAIR of fractures extending from the center of the DVD to the silvered data-bearing surface.  Repeated insertion and removal from its standard pressure/friction-fit DVD case, will cause this DVD to quickly disintegrate into an unreadable coffee-cup coaster.
4)  Oh yeah-- the MOVIE. *grin*  It's pure Dick Van Dyke musical.  I'd love to say it's Dick Van Dyke + Julie Andrews, like Mary Poppins, but it's not.  However, the Julie Andrews replacement used in this film is completely acceptable, and does a job equal to Ms. Andrews' performances, and almost as pretty onscreen.
Like the Andrews films ""Sound of Music"" and ""Mary Poppins"", the childrens' performances are somewhat weak.  Dick Van Dyke, however, is at the top of his game.  Amazing, in someone old enough to have grey in in his hair (40 something, at this point ?) is energetic enough to do over 20 takes (by his own reporting) of the ""Old Bamboo"" piece, where he's required to jump over a piece of bamboo that he's holding for himself (at slightly over waist height).  Good GOD, I may only know one person who can do that, even ONCE.
The music is memorable, especially the ""living doll"" duet late in the film.  The plot is predictable, and silly kids' stuff, but-- heck, this IS a kids' musical, so one can't expect a Dustin Hoffman acting level, with a Michael Moore punch and a Silence-of-the-Lambs plotline.
5)  Do you REALLY want to buy a Disney film, this year ?  I don't.  It'd send the wrong message to them, after they've withheld distribution (through their daughter-company Miramax) on the latest Michael Moore film (Fahrenheit 9/11).  Their excuse is, it'd endanger the million-dollar tax breaks they get from Bush's brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  So, they're copping out on their contractual obligation to distribute the film that got Cannes Film Festival's top award.  That ain't right.  If they'd had objections, the time to raise them was when the contract wasn't yet signed.  Don't support these guys.  Not this year.",1085616000,9,2929,4.788844621513944

1.  The Music:  It's fun and gets my son up and dancing around the room.  Also the words are catchy and easy for children to learn (although Chitty can be tricky for the little ones :-)
2.  Story line: It's really fun and easy to follow.  Anything with a car, let alone a flying car rates high with my son.
3.  Children:  The children in the story are sweet and respectful.  Since there is a boy and a girl not only does my son like it, but his little friend (a girl) also relates.

147635,3,0792839129,"Well...after all the waiting, it's finally landed.  I wish I could say that it's truly scrumptious, but in truth, from the ashes of disaster (the previous DVD release) grow the roses of mediocrity.  Like so many DVD ""special editions"" of late (A Christmas Story, Willy Wonka, etc), this one is a bit short on the ""special"".
The film itself is presented in two formats on the first disc.  Both widescreen and pan & scan.  The widescreen transfer is just slightly wider than the laserdisc release and the colors seem to me to be about the same, though my laserdisc is rotting and the colors are a bit compromised.  It might be worth getting for the widescreen alone if you don't already have at that aspect ratio.  Also on disc one is the ""sing along"" feature and a preview of the musical which only succeeds in demonstrating how fat Michael Ball is.
Disc two (home of the real disappointments) has a conversation type ""documentary"" with Dick Van Dyke (and ONLY Dick Van Dyke) where he reminisces about some of the cast.  Another new feature is with Pierre Picton, owner of the nicest of the on-screen cars and it's kind of a fun look at the eccentric who owns and cares for the car.  There are 3 vintage featurettes, one with designer Rowland Emett which is interesting, another which is apparently a press conference with Dick Van Dyke (boring) and the last ""featuring the children"" (but not really).  One excellent special feature (and kudos to the person responsible!), is the inclusion of more than a dozen of the Shermans original demos for the film.
There are about 7 trailers for the film, both theatrical and television, but not the one which followed the film on the laserdisc version which, to me, seems like the genuine trailer.  It is presented on the DVD in French, but not in English.
The remainder of the special features are kiddie things like digital coloring book, inventor games, etc.
I'm sure money may have been the reason for not presenting a more professional and interesting supplement.  Sally Ann Howes is alive and well...I've seen her in NY.  The kids, Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall, attended the premiere of the stage show in London, so they're definitely locateable.  Very little is said about the locations or the production of the film.  I was expecting a documentary of the caliber on MGM's Bond DVD releases given that the production company was largely the same.  At least pay Dick enough to do a running commentary!  Shame on you, MGM.

Dick Van Dyke was no good in Mary Poppins and is no good in this. Sally Ann Howes was meant to be the Julie Andrews of the movie, but wasn't half as good an actress or singer to potray the character convincingly.

One of the reasons is that we want our 2 year old to experience the movies we grew up with, and the other is nostalgia.
Before watching this movie again recently, I could only remember that there was a flying car, a nice title song, and something about children being kidnapped. Watching it again for the first time, I discovered that I had forgotten most of the movie.
Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke) is an inventor way ahead of his time, whose inventions don't always work the way they are intended.  If you think his name is weird, the female lead is Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), the daughter of a rich sweet manufacturer.  This unlikely pair, along with his two kids and the wonderful car, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, are the star players in a story which starts out being about pirates, and ends up as a rescue mission.  With comic support from Caractacus' father, and a toy maker (Benny Hill, in an uncharacteristic G rated performance), they defeat the schemes of spies (kind of like Laurel and Hardy combined with Boris and Natasha), an evil Baron and Baroness,and a wicked childcatcher, to bring the story within a story to a predictable but entertaining end.
The scenery is breathtaking, especially the Vulgarian castle and surroundings, and since this is a 1968 movie, we can forgive the lack of finesse in the special effects, where the characters stick out like sore thumbs from the backgrounds, and wires can be seen attached to Professor Potts during a dance sequence.
It's a little harder to swallow the concept of Truly Scrumptious running around on the beach dressed in tons of white cloth and coming up spotless, and her song about needing a lovely man is way too over the top and much too long. I will admit to skipping over that one.
The sing along feature is a nice touch, and catchy songs (other than the theme song) include ""Me Old Bamboo"", ""Toot Sweet"", my personal favorite ""P O S H (Posh)"", and the nearly too sugary ""Truly Scrumptious"".
Overall, this DVD is a refreshing family movie that you will watch over and over again.",1062288000,73,2248,4.64321608040201
147642,4,0792839129,"I remember seeing this film in the early 70's as a child and will never forget the experience. It was playing at a revival house, on a double bill with another film, and this one (not the film I was going there to see, by the way) carried me away so much that I cannot remember what film was paired with it. Since then I adored this enchanting fantasy epic. Upon seeing it again as an adult I was expecting to be disappointed (most of what we loved as children tends to pale as we get older), but I was not, in fact, I think I adore this charming concoction of tenderness, humour, fantastic situations and great musical numbers even more now than I did then.
And that leads me to my opening question: why do critics hate this film? I have never heard or read any professional critic say a good word about this film, in fact, it's on many critics' ""worst films of all time"" lists, and even popped up in that bible of bad cinema, Medved's ""Golden Turkey Awards"" book. I could never figure this out. Perhaps too many critics compare it to ""Mary Poppins"" and find it wanting. Surely, a temptation to do so is overwhelming, seeing as it popped up in that stream of (mostly poor) Poppins immitations that followed in the wake of Poppins' incredible box office and critical success, it stars Dick Van Dyke and features a score by the Sherman Brothers, songwriters for the Disney classic. But, while this film is certainly no Poppins, a comparison with the earlier film is unfair. Ian Fleming fans, of course, dislike the film because it bears little or no relation to the book (the screenplay by Roald Dahl was, to my own childlike imagination, however, fare more enjoyable - I found the book disappointing after viewing the film, unusual for me). But I will always cherish this film, its score, Dick Van Dyke's genius, Sally Ann Howes' charm, and Dahl's fantastic screenplay. I would recommend any parent to share this film with their children to show them what great fantasy ffamily film-making was like in the late sixties and early seventies.

147654,2,0792839129,"maybe for their 45th anniversary edition MGM will remember themselves and put it in WIDE SCREEN FORMAT!!! there is SO much that is lost in the pan&scan version. when a film was done back in the 60s, wide screen was a perc still and MGM was still the best at utilizing the format. the wider the better and the more of the screen you used to pull in your audience the better,too. well, with today's technology, it's not uncommon to find that a film is done in both perspectives to apease everyone, but super panorama was engulfing. i miss that feeling. the film is pretty much only 1/2 there, and 1/2 a musical is just annoying. will not buy it till it's out and done proper. i have & LOVE the mary popins dvd - that was done right...

147655,4,0792839129,"Fantasy movies are always a tricky sell to audiences- especially modern-day cynics, and that will probably never cease. But there are some green-lights to be mentioned in CCBB. I never read the book (which I imagine literary purists will hang me for), but what I found in the film was satisfying nevertheless. (I really only thought it to be too long when I was eight years old and when you're eight, fifteen minutes is too long.) On the other hand I was captivated with its story-within-a-story narrative- the blending of reality with fantasy. Some people here have complained about that blur, but that only enhances the fantasy of the film. The fantasy/reality blur reaches a pinnacle in the Act 1 finale with the Sally Ann Howes love song ""Lonely Man."" (Is this part of the regular movie or the beach picnic story? Hmmm.) Other musical plusses are ""Old Bamboo,"" ""Toot Sweets,"" ""Music Box,"" ""The Posh Life,"" and a sparkling gem: Dick Van Dyke's simple bedtime song ""Hushabye Mountain."" My only true complaint?

147658,5,0792839129,"""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" came out in 1968, and I can remember seeing it on t.v. when I was growing up in the 70's.  It was on par with ""The Wizard of Oz"" as it was shown once or twice a year on television, and they are both perfect films for the entire family to watch together. You can't say that about many movies that come out these days.
Dick Van Dyke plays Caracatus Potts, a oddball inventor, who lives in England with his two blond children, Jemima and Jeremy.
He is raising them on his own, and when the children almost get run over by ""Truly Scrumptious"", played by Sally Ann Howes, he meets the woman who just may help him out in bringing the children up.  The four of them embark on great adventure and song!  There are a few creepy moments. I especially was always freaked out by the childnapper. Other than that, it is a pure joy to view this over and over.
There are a lot of songs in this movie such as the title song, ""Truly Scrumptious"", ""Toot Sweets"", ""POSH"", and ""Hushabye Mountain"".  I really like all the music here as it all has it's place in this truly remarkable piece of family entertainment.
You can even watch it in ""sing a long"" mode and sing along with the cast. I can only hope in a few years, in the days of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Spy Kids"", that he will still appreciate this classic endearing piece of cinema.
There aren't any extras aside from the theatrical trailer, but I love this movie so much that didn't bother me.  One should purchase for the great movie that it is.
I am highly recommending you pick this movie up for your family's dvd collection!!",1031616000,9,1588,4.315436241610739
147659,4,0792839129,"I remember this movie from when I was still a child.  It has some scary and sad moments, if you have a phobia of water or darkness that could be a problem at times.  But overall it is just a fun story about an inventor and his family exploring other worlds so they can better appreciate their own.  Yup, it has a message but the message is mixed with music and fantasy.  Not as good as Mary Poppins or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory however.",1031184000,2,448,4.174418604651163
147660,1,0792839129,"First I have to say: I love this movie. That's why I would not touch this DVD with a ten foot pole. A trailer and a nice booklet is the best they can do? I don't think so. But what's worse: the movie is presented fullscreen, when in fact it should be the widest widescreen you've ever seen! I'm really glad I didn't throw away my good old faithful laserdisc collection.
Otherwise Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a treat for the whole family. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as always. Produced by Cubby Broccoli after a novel by Ian Fleming the movie features Desmond Llewelyn (James Bonds ""Q"") in a small role as a mechanic. Also look for Benny Hill and Lionel Jeffries. German Baddie Gert Frbe (aka ""Goldfinger"") gives a wonderful over-the-top performance as evil Baron Bomburst. And the Child Catcher scared the living daylights out of me, when I saw the movie as a child.
Dear MGM-Lion, what were you thinking when you put this great movie on such a lousy DVD? Please give it to the fans in the correct widescreen format and with a few extra treats. The movie deserves this - and I think we deserve it too.",1030924800,18,1100,4.4236453201970445
147661,1,0792839129,"I agree with the dozens of other viewers who have reviewed ""CCBB"" on DVD and commented on the ""Pan and Scan"" cropped TV format. Many people have gone out and spent much hard earned money on new large TV's even ""Widescreen TV's"" to share films like this with their families, especially their children. It seems many viewers and reviewers no less, are upset that this film had not been released in the SuperPanavision it was made in with a picture aspect ratio of at least 2:25:1. My two cents is, why can't we have ""BOTH"" widescreen and fullscreen formats on the same disc. It isn't expensive, I have several Warner Brothers and Columbia Tri-Star pictures with both formats on the same DVD. If they can do it and still sell the DVD for a modest price why can't MGM???? Actually, MGM has done this at least once for another title.  So MGM get to work and give us both formats of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" on one DVD and give those people over at Twentieth Century Fox (Who released ""The Sound of Music"" in both formats on ""two different"" disks!!!) a run for their money and really show your quality and you will see deep appreciation from your customer base who really love MGM!

147662,2,0792839129,"The movie is so sugary sweet  that one really needs a shower and an insulin shot. The Sherman Brothers are almost as shameful as Andrew Lloyd Weber when they play that incredibly annoying title song over and over  and over again. As if we didn't hear it  the first  seven times. It is one of the annoying tunes you can't get out of your head. Please make them stop.
I'm a musical lover.  I saw the movie when I was 12 and thought it was pure  nonsense.  I remember everyone in school  called it Pretty Sh-tty Bang Bang.  So thirty years later  is my reaction the same?
Yea!  It's way too long and much ado about nothing. It takes 14 minutes for the opening credits to give us the back history of the car which really has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Hadn't the producer or director heard of editing??  This is what killed the film musical.
Dick Van Dyke is a ne'er do well inventor with two kids. Sally Anne Howes almost runs the kids over and come to talk to Dick Van Dyke.  Van Dyke rescues a car his kids love that is scheduled for the junk heap. He rebuilds it and they all go for a ride in it.  Van Dyke tells  a fantasy story  about Nasty Bulgarians wanting the car he has reconditioned. The fantasy story lasts two hours.  Boy did they take a wrong turn.
The fantasy story is not as interesting as the original story of the romance between Sally ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke and this fantasy story takes up about two hours  of the three hour movie. About one hour and 45 minutes of the fantasy needed to be cut. But I guess they thought it was cute. I'm sure they also thought the title song was cute. I'm sure they thought those cute kids could sing.
Sally Ann Howes has a perfectly annoying name--Truly Scrumptious. And those kids who can't sing (didn't anyone notice this?)  croon the ""Truly Scrumptious"" song to her. It made this twelve year old roll his eyes. The adult me had the same reaction.  Please make those kids  stop singing that awful song. It's enought to make one stop loving musicals.
Okay Dick Van Dyke is likeable enough but not as effective as in Mary Poppins.  He shines with the song ""The Old Bamboo"" ( the best number) and his caring for the kids.  Alas, he's railroaded by the insipid story and material. Someone also told him not to use an English accent although his kids and father have one.
Sally Ann  Howes is charming enough and perfectly cast in a part that Julie Andrews (the wise)  probably turned down.  She is railroaded by the material especially  that awful ballad ""Lonely Man""  sung in an operatic style  that can not be appreciated by Musical theatre buffs, opera buffs  nor kids. Please make her stop singing it . Please make her stop twirling her skirt and running through the countryside. It isn't cute.
 I chuckled out loud at Lionel Jeffries'  travelling  song ""Posh"" which he sings  suspended in his cabin from a zeppelin while kidnapped.  An absolute highlight.  There is also some over the top annoying buffonery from Gert Frobe, Anna Quayle, Benny Hill  and the two kidnap men.
The magical Dee dee Wood and Mark Breaux who wonderfully choreographed Mary Poppins and Sound of Music  ( and recreated Michael Kidds  Lil Abner) are apparently at a loss here as there work is almost entirely hack. The Sherman Brothers really needed to rewrite songs instead of the awful  mish mash they have assembled here.
A spoonful of rewrites could have made the score go down!
Put that in your candy bar!
There is too much bad candy here and not enough substance. It isn't truly scrumpttious. It isn't Toots Sweet. It isn't cute. Run for your insulin.",1030838400,6,3597,4.465437788018433

Once the story moves irrelevantly to a bizarre imaginary kingdom ruled by an evil baron, the whole thing goes downhill. There are a few good songs in this movie, among them the title song and ""From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success,"" and the ending is good once we get back to reality, but the film would have been better had it left out most of the third reel.

147672,3,0792839129,"I rented this the other day because my wife had never seen it.  I found it just as enjoyable as ever.  Dick van Dyke proves that Jim Carrey did not invent the art of physical comedy (I'll tip my hat to Danny Kaye as well).  Forgettable score?...  Let's compare this with the drivel cranked out today; all the pop, R&B infested soundtracks designed to sell CD's rather than enhance the story.  Most of the numbers, in fact, are quality works.  Granted, the title song does have a kind of a persistent monotony, rivaled only by ""It's a Small World""... but one should, perhaps, forgive this in light of the haunting minor-moded lullaby ""Hushabye Mountain"", the rousing ""Me 'Ol Bamboo"" (what a feast of choreography!) and the captivating ""Doll on a Music Box/Truley Scrumptious"" duet, which I believe is one of the great moments of music theater on film (I only wish that van Dyke had been permitted to fully complete the counterpoint to Howes' charming melody.)
Too long?... maybe it seems that way because Disney has spent a good part of the century teaching us that good children's movies end after 75 minutes.  Anyone who thinks a kid's attention span isn't longer than that hasn't watched one glued to a Playstation console for half a day (or more.)

147674,3,0792839129,"When I was five, I saw ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" My dad said I fell asleep during it because it was too long. Thirty-two years later, it's still too long.
This is decent family fare, and has some wonderful moments (for one, who would have thought Dick Van Dyke was such a good dancer?), and has terrific production values, but it's overlong and overblown.
Take the opening sequence, for example: it takes about 10 minutes just to fill in the backstory of the car that would become Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and by the time it's done, we're not even sure what it has to do with the story. Wouldn't it have been more fun for the characters to come upon a car with a mysterious background, and find out the story later? The same can be said of the musical numbers, some of which go on far too long.
The net result is a children's movie with an intermission, which is a prescription for failure.
That's a shame, because this film has many strengths. It's chock full of good humor and energy, the gadgets and the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car are ingenious and engaging, and Van Dyke's performance is very entertaining. I've seen the special effects maligned, but I found them to be pretty convincing, especially for 33-year-old work.
I also liked the camera work and English scenery.
However, after a while, the endless musical numbers get tiresome (they're not that great to begin with, particularly when you compare them to similar sequences in films of that era like ""The Sound of Music,"" or even ""Oliver!""), and the happy banter gets a bit too sweet. If the film had been shortened, and the weaker musical numbers edited out, it would have been far snappier and more fun.
""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was written by Ian Fleming and produced by Albert Broccoli, who are better known respectively as the writer of the James Bond books and the producer of the Bond movies, and you can actually see the Bond formula in this film. After all, the title is about a gadget-laden car (though Bond's 1977 Lotus Esprit submarine from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is still my favorite), and the heroine is named Truly Scrumptious. If that one wouldn't get laughts in a bond movie, what would? Gert Frobe and Desmond Llewellyn, better known as Auric Goldfinger and ""Q"" from the Bond series, make appearances.
Also, look for Benny Hill (less the half-naked tarts, of course) as a toymaker.
I suppose the length of this film does have a good point: kids LOVE this movie, so if you need a few hours alone, just pop this baby in and you're all set.",993513600,9,2520,4.565121412803532

My whole family loves this  movie and i was so happy when i recieved it as a christmas present last  year. The songs are catchy and funny. The colors are bright and the plot is  clever. Though this movie was released in 1968, it seems much newer than  that, it is timeless. Dick Van Dyke is funny as the ""absent  minded"" inventor, and Sally Ann Howes truly is ""truly  scrumptious"". The inventor's 2 children are both cute as well. Get  this 30th Anniversary edition of the video and be amazed at the quality of  film-making. Enjoy!",966384000,3,727,4.365671641791045
147685,5,0792839129,"I can't begin to tell you how many times my 2.5 year old son has asked to watch this video. He loves the car and the kids and the songs. It's a long movie, so we tend to watch it in batches.
We even bought the soundtrack  for the car!",961632000,2,234,3.68
147686,1,0792839129,"A gorgeous film, perfectly restored picture and good restored 5.1 sound. BUT how dare they to cut it down to full screen. The opening is letterboxed, you can read that the film is in s u p e r panavision. After  the opening the curtain closes halfway.
That ""1 star"" is for  the fullscreen version - should be ""no stars"". The rest is  ""five stars""",961286400,31,346,4.292307692307692
147687,4,0792839129,"I am quite frankly appalled at the countless reviews I have found bashing this timeless classic. For heavens sakes people, it's a CHILD'S movie! Do you think children care if the musical numbers aren't the ""creme ala  creme"", NO! Do you think they care if the acting talent in this cute  comedy is ground chuck compaired to the ""filet mignon"" of  Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""superb"" acting ability? Really people go  easy on it. My children love it, so that's good enough for me.",955584000,6,475,4.686746987951807

147689,3,0792839129,"OTHER THAN THE CLASSIC DISNEY CARTOONS, CCBB WAS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE MOVIES FOR ME AS A CHID. A FLYING CAR, NIFFTY GADETS, LOVABLE GOOFY TUNES, AND OF COURSE THE ""CHILD CATCHER"".  DRESSED ALL IN BLACK, WITH A  VERY PALE SKIN FACE, HE SEARCHES THE KINGDOM TO CAPTURE ANY AND ALL  CHILDREN, BY ANY MEANS. HE WAS TRULY TERRIFING.  IT RIVALS THE WITCH OF THE  WEST FROM ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"".  I STILL ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE,  EXCEPT FOR ONE MAJOR FLAW IN THE DVD EDITION.  THE MOVIE WAS FILMED IN  SUPER PANAVISION 70MM, WHAT CONSUMERS GOT IS A  PAN N SCAN TV VERSION.  THIS IS TRULY AN ABOMINATION OF WHAT THE DIRECTOR ENTEDED US TO SEE.  ALL  MOVIES SHOULD BE SHOWN IN THERE ORIGINAL FORMAT! .

My 3 year old it likes it almost as much as Mary Poppins (her  favorite).  The clips are short and the scenes change often, the music is  catchy and rhythmic, and the theme is wholesome and without profanity. It's  a family classic that should be introduced well before low quality and  violent television that exists today.  The DVD quality was fine.  A step  above VHS, but most people that  would buy this movie, aren't the one's  worrying about the digital quality that one reader reviewed.  Give it a  try!",947289600,6,665,4.470588235294118

As a toddler, the kidnapper terrified me so much, I crouched down behind the seat of our convertible (Drive-In showing) and never came back up for the duration of  the film, eventually falling asleep.  It was Years later that I had the  opportunity to view it again.  Bear in mind that in those days you had One  shot of viewing and retaining the memory of it.  How disappointing that the  DVD version of this classic is Not in widescreen and features the  ridiculous intermission segment which backtracks prior to plummeting off  the cliff.  The laserdisc version, presented in Widescreen, is far  superior, though it also includes the forementioned intermission segment.  A 5-star film in a 2-star format.",944006400,4,761,4.944444444444445

This is one you can take them to and they will  remember. My  now 32 year old had a replica of the car and as a new Father,  he recently purchased this  to ""view"" with his 10 month old  daughter. Not surprisingly, she wasn't very impressed. I believe he bought  it for himself. I know his daughter will love it when she is old enough to  understand it.",942969600,7,509,4.122448979591836

They go on an adventure (during which the car flies and floats) and when he returns, he finds that the candy he invented is a success (so now he feels he can marry the banker's daughter).

One reviewer felt that some of the scenes in the adventures might be a bit much for young kids. I'm not sure. It might depend on your children and how they react.",1524268800,,491,4.223404255319149
