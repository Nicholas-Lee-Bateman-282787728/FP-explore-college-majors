4960443,5,B0065IZJJS,"I watched a few episodes of the American version with the usual result: ""Meh. Are we supposed to find this guy admirable or sympathetic? A pathological liar; compulsive gambler and all around jerk. Keegan Deene? Wha..?"" I saw in the credits that this show was ""based on"" (read: plagiarized) from an Australian series of the same name. A quick right turn to Amazon and Voila! A pathological liar, compulsive gambler AND a drug addict, to boot, that I can relate to! Keegan Deene? Try Cleveland Greene, A rounder, rogue and ne're-do-well that I would love to run with, while keeping one hand on my wallet. If you love the English language and like to hear it spoken crisply and well, though with a ""strine"" accent, this is your show. And wait until you hear one of Cleve's diatribes about anything and everything that annoys him. Devastating. There is a broad ""arc"" in the series that has Cleve pushed and pulled by outrageous fortune into and out of what can only be called Life. The supporting cast is excellent and pitch perfect. Who wouldn't want a mate like Barney? Pass by the watered down Yank version of ""RAKE"" and get this version. Fair Dinkum.",1395532800,7,1151,4.674876847290641

4960466,4,B0065IZJJS,"it took me some time to appreciate it.  All the characters are quite interesting and Richard Roxburgh is spot on as ""Rake.""

It is somewhat difficult to know who everyone is; and who the characters are that you need to know; and which ones you can forget about.

The characters are generally interesting, even though Roxburgh steals most of the scenes which he is in (again, he is an acquired taste).  But he is genuinely intelligent, funny and very flawed.  Therefore, many of the people with whom he interacts are also intelligent and flawed, but not to the same extent.

The lead character is not a likable guy; but he is interesting enough to keep you entertained and paying attention.  Eventually, I did get to like the lead character, but this took me about 3 seasons.

There is a lot of drunkenness, drug usage, and illicit sex.  I don't recall there being any nudity, but there may have been.

Spoiler alert: One weakness I find with many Australian series is, there is often an act of adultery early on (or another major event); and it seems forced; and more or less thrown into the show in order to revolve the characters around it.  In this show, the adultery is at least treated as a devastating event (I have seen some where it came off as not that big of a deal).",1507766400,3,1277,4.484848484848484

4960474,4,B0065IZJJS,".
Though the DVD was released a month or so ago, Ive just gotten around to watching it. Its another one of the sort of funny crime, mystery or procedural dramas from the UK, Australia or Canada that Acorn gives US viewers a chance to enjoy. This may not be my favorite of this genre (some are more engaging for me) but I liked it and am looking forward to more seasons.

Before I say anything else about this particular DVD, Ill point out  no spoiler alert!  that this series started on the commercial Australian Broadcasting Network in 2010 and has already completed FOUR seasons. (Acorn has season 2 out soon followed by the rest. This is important because any cliffhangers are resolved in the next season (unlike some other recent DVDs Ive reviewed whose contract was not renewed and left us hanging.

Because this is (mostly) a courtroom series (though about 50% of the time its about the drug and sexual aspects of the characters lives) I won't [provide any spoilers  and encourage you to watch out for too much plot revelation in other reviews.  After all, you want to enjoy it as much as the reviewer did, right?

The series is not rated but there is graphic violence, language and nudity here.

Through the eight episodes on this set, Ive learned to sort of understand the lead character  barrister Cleeve Greene  who is usually a loose cannon when not snorting cocaine. But I think it will take another season for me to really understand him.
There are very easy to read English subtitles as an option and I found them helpful to use since some of the Australian slang ran by me too fast. Its nice to have the option.

This Season has no special features  not even the now-obligatory behind the scenes featurette. I just got Season 2 and they are there.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4960494,4,B0065IZJJS,"Rake, Series 1. This award-winning legal dramatic comedy from Australia first aired on the Australian Broadcasting Corporations ABC1 in 2010, has aired for four seasons.  In it, in a Silver Logie award-winning role, Richard Roxborough (MOULIN ROUGE, VAN HELSING)  turns in a champion performance  as brilliant but self-destructive Sydney barrister (as in the U.K., this means a lawyer able to practice in court) Cleaver Greene. The criminal barrister Greene, a champion anti-hero, is many things to many people: an outrage, a mate, a wit, an unreliable ex-husband or friend or father, a tax cheat, a champion of lost causes, a gambling-- and cocaine addict-- who perhaps also drinks more than he should. His specialty: defending the indefensible, from bigamists to cannibals to practitioners of bestiality. We also meet pedophilia, but not in court, in Cleaver's chaotic private life. And youve got to say, no matter what else, in this fresh, irreverent, darkly comic Australian courtroom dramedy, some pretty unusual cases reach the court.  The Guardian(UK) called it ""Scathing legal drama...teeming with sex, violence, and smart dialogue.""

Of course, it takes  pretty outstanding actors to carry off some of these parts, and the series does have a number of good  actors helping out, from Danielle Cormack, (WENTWORTH); to Oscar-nominated Rachel Griffiths, (BROTHERS & SISTERS, MURIELS WEDDING); to Hugo Weaving, (THE LORD OF THE RINGS, V FOR VENDETTA, CAPTAIN AMERICA); to Sam Neill,(JURASSIC PARK, PEAKY BLINDERS) and Noah Taylor(GAME OF THRONES). Mind you, you would probably not want your daughter to marry Cleaver, or to go anywhere near him, in fact; nor would any sensible woman.  Yet women do  like Cleaver  we do so like bad boys. And, to be fair, he does have looks, charm, brains, a sense of humor, and, heaven knows, experience.  And it must be said that, despite his rakes lifestyle, his wit and charm have  won him  many cases, lovers and friends over the years.

The box set, of which I received an advance copy in return for an honest interview, consists of three discs totaling  approximately 450 minutes, with subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not familiar with Oz-speak.  The series also contains violence, strong language, nudity, drug use, and sexual situations: don't tell me you're surprised.  And bear it in mind, family viewers: best for mature viewers only.  Well, Mama and Poppa might not approve of this guy, nor will some viewers, and I doubt youd actually want him in your life, but he sure is fun to watch.",1493942400,,2549,5.1012048192771084
4960505,4,B0065IZJJS,"This series box contains every adult-warning allowableand thats only this lawyers opening argument. Cleaver Greene (Richard Roxburgh) defends the low-life accusedand lives a personal lifestyle as crudely as his clients. It makes for a truly odd and often humorous law drama. Britain deported convicts to Australia and this series finds and prosecutes them. Theres probably something to disgust or offend every viewer, yet its hard to stop watching to see what misfit court abuse will appear next. Some good acting of people going rogue, and some notable guest stars too. Not all drop their costume.
Greene is the Rake/R or barrister; and the v in the titles is a bit off, as the following name is not the opponent but barrister Greenes client of the episode. Great performances also by Adrienne Pickering and Danielle Cormack (Wentworths Bea) and not just because they bare-ly it all.
An Aussie wallabaloo with bonzer bodgy bludgers.

SDH SUBTITLES for all feature episodes with this Series set
[1] R v Murray ==Greene must defend an important economist. But did he eat a victim? Alas, his fave lady-of-the-multiple-evenings does a bunker.
[2] R v Marx ==A case of deliberate negligent defense to please the client. Expect wig-less and gown-less scenes aplenty.
[3] R v Dana ==Rival solicitor Potter bests Greene. Can a bigamy-charged chef cook up something positive? Deborah Kennedy (A Place to Call Home) as a guest attorney.
[4] R v Lorton ==Defense of a down-&-out artist accused of a toy-beau alley murder.
[5] R v Chandler ==Greene addresses relationships via a small-c-coke fix and a doctor friend faces a reveal-all DVD. A Chandler couple played by Sam Neill (Peaky Blinders) and Heather Mitchell (A Place to Call Home).
[6] R v Langhorn ==Vigilantism hyping radio personality speaks up. Will she be locked up?
[7] R v Tanner ==Bad Rx heist wounds Rake Greene; Attorney Generals escapades are publicized; and some good old assault for the courts.
[8] R v Corella ==Greene defends his loan shark nemeses on a dismembered murder charge. Barneys back. And wow, a touching scene.

4960573,5,B0065IZJJS,"I've seen more than my share of great TV series over the few years but ""Rake"" is absolutely right at the top.

Here's the scoop. Cleaver Greene (Richard Roxburgh) is a barrister in Australia and he's a real piece of work. He's too clever by half. He's well educated. Well read. He can read a person or situation as quick as a bullet and respond just as quickly. But, on the dark side, he's way too into booze, women, gambling and just has a knack for screwing things up. This series chronicles both him and the cases on which he happens to be working.

Like many of the best series over the past some years this has episodes which stand alone as well as a longer arc regarding many of the other things in which Greene is involved. He is what's happening here. He's a living train wreck and, as much as he puts everyone around him off, no one seems to be able to stay mad at him. He's a charismatic, engaging individual. The cases in which he is involved are generally cool and involve some really clever twist. Plus, as bight and savvy as he might be, he doesn't always read the case right and gets caught with the smelly end of the stick. He will make the viewer nervous because he gets himself in such deep doo-doo it's difficult to see how he'll make it out.

The writing is exceptional. One of the things that surprised me was the great number of references to things happening in the United States. Some are socio-political while others are entertainment related. I guess we do have an influence on the rest of the western world. All the production values are on par with the content and the music is good. The intro for the show is utterly cool. Maybe the best I've ever seen. This might not be quite worth the  5 stars I gave it but it's certainly better than 4. If you want a great time. see it. I doubt you'll regret it.",1424995200,4,1829,4.292753623188406
4960574,5,B0065IZJJS,"This is certainly one of the best TV shows to be made in Australia for years. Cleaver Greene is a lawyer who defends some of the worst clients imaginable. He takes them basically because no one else will have them and because no one else will have him! He is untidy and disorganized. He is also a boozer, gambler and adulterer and the show concerns his many misadventures. It is, to say the least, highly entertaining. You wouldn't want to trust him with your daughter or wife but there is still something admirable about him. He is the rogue who does the things that sensible people recoil from. It is compelling watching him choose poorly and then scramble to get out by the seat of his pants. There's plenty of times where he fails and suffers excruciating consequences. The humour is pretty black most of the time.

The supporting cast is excellent. Most characters who come into contact with Greene suffer for it. Yet this makes for some very entertaining sub-stories. There are corrupt politicians, mobsters and a beautiful prostitute/ex-prostitute.  Greene's long suffering family offers some great storylines too. There is some lovely character development over the three series too. Don't be mistaken though, the show is strictly for adults. There is strong language, drug use and heaps of sex. It is not a show for people who like their protagonists to be decent and heroic either. Greene is the supreme anti-hero, he is completely unreconstructed, deeply flawed but always fascinating and often very, very funny. It is very well written. There are some great surprises at times and some cracker lines. It is also very aptly titled! Very highly recommended!",1405555200,6,1667,4.9288256227758005

8493405,5,B0065IZJJS,"Season 1 of Rake was so funny that I laughed so hard it hurt. It was also very interesting, for example, in terms of the psychological strategies employed to convince the juries, and in terms of some of the legal and other issues raised. (I definitely wouldn't bother with subsequent seasons though. Not a patch on the first season. Seasons 2 and 3 descended into uninteresting and not very funny soap opera territory.)",1517616000,,419,4.7534246575342465

Amazon sent a replacement for this film.  It had a problem in the 2nd episode.  We can always count on Amazon.",1516579200,,271,4.153846153846154
