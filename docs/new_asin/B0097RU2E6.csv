5277122,5,B0097RU2E6,It had never been opened! I am giving it to my boyfriend for Valentines Day! Nothing was bent on the package.,1359849600,,109,4.238095238095238
5277123,5,B0097RU2E6,"I always look forward to the release of new box sets containing great NBA games, and hope that they will include a number of new games which I do not own.

Although this years other Essentials sets have been by and large disappointing due to recycling content, this set does not disappoint. It contains only one game which I am aware of having been previously released - the clincher of the 1998 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. The four other games are previously unreleased, and include one of the most early games yet released (a 75 playoff game) along with one of the greatest ever first round playoff games from a series which was arguably the best first round playoff series ever.

The 1998 game is the only thing that made me think twice about a 5 star rating - it is excusable because it is an (or perhaps THE) all time great game and is 'essential'. However, it has been released twice before on collections which are readily available, including the ever rereleased ultimate Jordan collection. If it had to be released again, it would have been better served on a full set of the 1998 finals. But it isn't enough to prevent the set getting five stars.

I only hope that this continues to be used as a prototype for what new NBA box sets should look like - great content, but also previously unreleased content.",1357516800,4,1321,4.518828451882845
5277124,2,B0097RU2E6,"Potential buyers should know Game 1 of this set is not Game 2 of the 75 Bulls-Warriors series (Bulls 90-G State 89) but the much less dramatic Game 3 of this series (Bulls 108 - G State 101). There are no inserts desribing any of the games. The DVD's come on a spindle stacked on top of each other leaving them prone to scratching so you'll want to put them in paper sleeves or a jewel case.

That said Bulls fans would most likely still be interested in this set mainly for Discs 1,2, and 4. (Game 3 as well if not already owned) The 75 game features the core group the Bulls had for 5-6 years in action - Sloan, Love, Walker, Van Lier (would have liked Game 2 instead of Game 3!). Game 2 is a regular season thriller against the Knicks in one of Jordan's first games back in his first comeback. Game 3 (previously included on the Bulls Dynasty series and the Best of Jordan) is the 98 finale against the Jazz. Game 4 which is a nice addition is the 2009 triple OT playoff game against Boston.

IMO Game 5 is the big disappointment - a regular season 2011 win against Miami. No big shots down the stretch, just free throws. Of course, the Bulls would proceed to lose to Miami in the playoffs when it really counted. How is this game essential? Perhaps the 89 playoff win against Cleveland, the 91 playoff clincher against Detroit or a finals game against Portland, Phoenix or Seattle could have been considered more essential.",1353888000,22,1427,4.360902255639098
