7463603,1,B01690GTJU,This movie was absolutely the poorest excuse for a modern day western or any genre I've ever encountered.  No value whatsoever and continual bad language made it really unbearable to watch.  If I were the producer or director--and I think you know who I mean--I would be SO embarrassed for releasing such garbage!!  The picture on the front of the DVD was terribly misleading!!  Only wish I'd known.  IMDB was NO help!!,1453075200,5,419,4.763888888888889
7463604,3,B01690GTJU,"This is a modern western drama that takes place in Odem, Texas. Brothers Sean (Patrick John Flueger) and Tommy Donnelly (Austin Nichols) are ranch hands who work for Boss Flood (Kris Kristofferson) who has a minor role compared to his billing. Mr Reed (Beau Bridges) owns the ranch and has a cameo role. Both brothers are married with a daughter.

Tommy ""ain't worth shootin'"" and is in trouble. He owes a guy named Eddie (Kurt Caceres) six thousand dollars and Eddie wants his money. Sean is torn between helping his useless brother and his family, although it seems he can do both.

The acting was okay. The plot plowed along until they couldn't work the Eddie trying to get his money anymore. The acting and story was okay, showing us some of the unpleasant tasks of being a ranch hand. Works as a drama, don't expect an action or thriller.

8735847,3,B01690GTJU,"First off, the trailer is incredibly misleading, hinting at a much more interesting and complex movie than you actually get. As it is, the film is disappointingly straightforward as one brother tries to help the other get out from under a $6K debt. The acting is decent but the supporting characters are given next to nothing to do as Kristofferson, Beau Bridges, Julianna Guill, and others are barely present. Bridges only has a single scene in the film. Based on the trailer, one would expect more from Guill's character but they apparently cut most of her scenes.",1471651200,,566,4.845360824742268
