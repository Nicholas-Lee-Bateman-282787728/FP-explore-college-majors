I also like the performance of the faun in this version far better than the new one. And the expression of the children when Mr Beaver tells them Asian is on the move has to be seen.

This version is the cream of the crop for me on Narnia movies.  The voice acting from some of the kids is laughably fake, and the witch is extreme in her emotional explosions--but they actually make the experience funnier!

Here in the simplicity of cartoon, we rediscover this tale written so very long ago.

More than the others, this movie focuses clearly on the theme of redemption, and even more, it is not so scary for younger children during the battle scenes just because it is a cartoon.

2423384,3,B000BKVRME,"Personally, I liked the Disney 2005 LWW -- for adults.  HOWEVER, the warfare and extremely realistic monsters in that version are too scary for my little kids.

I had seen this movie on TV from time to time in the 80s, and I got the DVD based on those memories.  It is faithful to the original book (which I have read out loud to my kids), but the witch is really screechy.  One of the best things about the book, and about the 2005 movie, is that the witch is attractive/evil.  This version's witch has no allure -- which does make it a bit harder to reinforce to my kids that evil is seductive.

Time enough for that.

One thing I REALLY like about this version is that Edmund is so easy to understand -- his jealousy and mean-spiritedness are easy for little kids to pick up on.  The other three children are not well-developed characters at all -- this is mostly Edmund's story.  Appropriate for talking about each of our own needs for redemption.

This is a decent version of the story, laden with obvious commercial breaks, and you can certainly tell it is old-school animation.  But in my opinion, it's well worth having for your kids to watch.",1274054400,,1151,4.433333333333334

2423386,3,B000BKVRME,"I have to say, I can remember watching this production of The Chronicles of Narnia on Public Television when I was a child.  I envied the characters (especially Lucy! ...she was always so sweet!) I wanted one of the beavers, and was spooked by the witch.  Yet all of it was enchanting to me.

As a mother, I watched with delight this very same version with my children...who were also enthralled by it... but didn't desire to be Lucy as I once did.  (the fact that they were all boys may have had something to do with it! )  :)  Now, as a grandmother, I now own  my own copy of this production to share with my grandchildren.  Perhaps one day, I'll be able to share it with my great grandchildren as well.

It is timeless... and has a special place in my heart.",1252368000,,761,4.229166666666667

2423388,3,B000BKVRME,"A few years ago, C.S. Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" followed in the footsteps of the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"" with a gleaming new big-screen adaptation.

And despite the new movie's presence, it's worth taking a trip back to the 1988 adaptation of Lewis's book, produced by the BBC. It's evenly divided between good and bad -- good scripting and some good acting, but also some poor acting and some unintentionally silly moments (animal costumes). Seriously, will Lucy ever stop whining, and will the Witch ever stop screeching?

The four Pevensie children arrive in the country, at the start of World War II. Despite the eccentric but friendly professor (Michael Aldridge) who lives there, they're all bored. And during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) slips into an old wardrobe -- and finds that the back of it opens into a magical, snowy forest land called Narnia. She encounters a friendly faun, but when she arrives back home, she finds that none of her siblings believe her.

But soon Lucy and her siblings find their way through -- not knowing that peevish Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) has already allied himself to the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman) who keeps Narnia locked in winter. She's especially desperate, because Narnia is beginning to thaw out, now that leonine Aslan is coming back to it, and the Pevensie kids have shown up to fulfil an old prophecy. But the Witch won't go down without a massive battle -- and one that might destroy the lion-messiah himself.

""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a mixed bag -- it has more or less equal measures of good and bad. What it also has is deep fidelity to Lewis's original book, which was one of the first major fantasies to get widespread attention. And that's definitely an important detail, since the spirit of the book could easily have been lost.

The filmmakers obviously did their homework, crafting the script and dialogue to be close to Lewis's novel. And it's a credit that they pulled off some lines that could have sounded idiotic (""You're not dead, Aslan!"" ""Do I look dead?"") in the wrong hands. They also did an excellent job of changing atmosphere, shifting from the stodgy English country house to the airy frozen Narnia, with its castles and dewy wildlands.

Unfortunately, the special effects haven't aged well. They were state of the art at the time, but now they look quite cheesy and low budget, with a few exceptions -- the scene where Lucy restores various ""statued"" people to life is pretty good. The other stuff ranged from primitive bluescreen to an enormous puppet playing Aslan. It's a good puppet, and remarkably convincing physically, but it still makes Aslan look like he has a wicked case of arthritis.

The acting is also divided between good and bad. Scott is particularly good as the ""bad boy"" Edmund, who ends up falling in with the Witch, especially when he turns on his evil mentor. He is accompanied by some good acting from Sophie Cook as Susan, and Richatd Dempsey as Peter, who also has to do a convincing battle with a werewolf. The weak links are Wilcox, who speaks most of her lines in a whine, and Kellerman, who laughs madly, coos and shrieks, and generally hams it up like a lunatic.

While the new version of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has captured the imaginations of moviegoers, the BBC version is still worth taking a look at.",1248393600,,3398,4.747457627118644
2423389,5,B000BKVRME,My opion this is the only version for young children.  My children loved it and watched it over and over and now my grandchild is doing the same.,1233532800,,145,4.178571428571429

It brings a warm sense of nostalgia to see it, and it's a fun movie to watch as a family and suitable for kids. The animation is kinda lame, but it plays out in a way that old school people just don't care. It's a fun watch and has very memorable music.

2423394,5,B000BKVRME,"I watched this over and over when it was broadcast in '79 or something.  I say that because it had a frequency of re-occuring on TV more than once that year.

The seriousness in the dialouge and the music haunting and subtle a different world than today.  I compare it with ""Fligth of Dragons"" and ""The Last Unicorn"" other examples that should be the basis for all animation.  The other revewers speak of cover art. Never judge a DVD by it's ""cover"". It is not important, it's just a box of cardboard, ignor it!  The video is the quality of the original and not the box cutesy artsy(whatever).

It is a very good adaptation from the book and seems to capture the essence of the book even better than the more recent elaborately produced Disney version.

I loved every minute of the film and remember going outside and playing ""Narnia"" in the forest area at the campground we were staying at.  All through my life I remembered parts of the movie vividly even though I never read the book or even saw the movie again.

When I was in my mid-20's and was waiting for Disney's Live Action version to be released, I decided to read the book and was surprised how well this animated version I watched as a child held to the book, and even more surprising, how vividly I could recall the cartoon as I read through the book.

It was an exciting day when I finally watched this animated version with my wife 21 years after watching it for our first time (we saw the movie together when we were seven).  I was a little surprised that the animation wasn't quite as high quality as I remember it being, but it was the same great story, and now that I am older, a beautiful soudtrack to accompany the film.

2423400,5,B000BKVRME,"Winning a 1979 Emmy award for ""Outstanding Animated Program"" (executive producer David D. Connell and producer Steven Cuitlahuac Melendez) and being nominated for a second  in Outstanding Individual Achievement - Animation Program"" (writers Bill Melendez and Connell), this animated version of the C.S. Lewis book holds a special place in my heart - it was the adaptation that introduced me to Narnia.

Directed by Bill Melendez (the man who gave us the Charlie Brown and Peanuts movies) this cartoon is beautiful in its simplicity. Of course to am eight-year old the  Christian imagery was not apparent, but what I do remember through the clouds of nostalgia is being entranced by the magic and the adventure.  Made for television it was one of those movies tha tbecame a perennial favorite for British television during the movie-heavy Christmas period and was one that I eagerly awaited (this was after all the days before the mass ownership of VCR's.) So, it was with a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation that I picked up my copy - and I was not disappointed.

Of course for big-screen spectacle  nothing can really match the 2005 Disney blockbuster of the same name (which has become Disney's most successful live-action movie ever with grosses over $740 million and has a second movie PRINCE CASPIAN prepping for a summer 2008 release,) but for simple storytelling and involving characters this animated movie is successful in what it sets out to do.

Featuring clever narration by the leads, dead-on expression by the characters and lines taken from the Lewis book this movie succeeds in making a faithful, good  adaptation  in 95 minutes.

This version also features two of the most recognizable voices from British television of this era in Leslie Phillips as Mr. Timnus and Leo McKern as the professor, amongst a cast of largely unknowns.

The animation can appear inconsistent at times but the drawing style is both unique and enchanting.  This is a far better work than the BBC production, which featured terrible production design and acting and perhaps the most fake-looking Aslan possible.

The story is well-known but for those who are unfamiliar with the novel or the adaptations the story revolves around four children who are sent to live with a professor. There they find a passage to a mysterious land known as Narnia through the back of a giant wardrobe. Narnia is a world in a state of perpetual winter due to the rule of the evil White Witch. But, the childrens arrival has been foretold and a determined group of magical creatures, led by the noble lion Aslan believe they are the ones predicted to deliver Narnia from the witch's iron grip.

This is a ""kid-safe"" production that parents need not worry about showing to their children, the action scenes are done just right and the dark moments are not taken too seriously, and yet there is enough intellect in the exposition to satisfy adults.

The music by Michael J. Lewis is also a highlight which is full of light and fits the scenes perfectly.

There are two versions of this movie available on DVD. In an unusual move the cheaper of the two is actually better. Whereas the more expensive version clocking in at just under $25 has only some trailers, the cheaper one (for about $14 or less) has information on Lewis and the Narnia books).  Certainly the cover and menu's may be better on the more expensive one, but other than that the cheaper version is the easier one to recommend.",1147996800,,3476,4.864406779661017

Made for television it was one of those movies tha tbecame a perennial favorite for British television during the movie-heavy Christmas period and was one that I eagerly awaited (this was after all the days before the mass ownership of VCR's.) So, it was with a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation that I picked up my copy - and I was not disappointed.

Of course for big-screen spectacle  nothing can really match the 2005 Disney blockbuster of the same name (which has become Disney's most successful live-action movie ever with grosses over $740 million and has a second movie PRINCE CASPIAN prepping for a summer 2008 release,) but for simple storytelling and involving characters this animated movie is successful in what it sets out to do.

Featuring clever narration by the leads, dead-on expression by the characters and lines taken from the Lewis book this movie succeeds in making a faithful, good  adaptation  in 95 minutes.

This version also features two of the most recognizable voices from British television of this era in Leslie Phillips as Mr. Timnus and Leo McKern as the professor, amongst a cast of largely unknowns.

The animation can appear inconsistent at times but the drawing style is both unique and enchanting.  This is a far better work than the BBC production, which featured terrible production design and acting and perhaps the most fake-looking Aslan possible.

The story is well-known but for those who are unfamiliar with the novel or the adaptations the story revolves around four children who are sent to live with a professor. There they find a passage to a mysterious land known as Narnia through the back of a giant wardrobe. Narnia is a world in a state of perpetual winter due to the rule of the evil White Witch. But, the childrens arrival has been foretold and a determined group of magical creatures, led by the noble lion Aslan believe they are the ones predicted to deliver Narnia from the witch's iron grip.

This is a ""kid-safe"" production that parents need not worry about showing to their children, the action scenes are done just right and the dark moments are not taken too seriously, and yet there is enough intellect in the exposition to satisfy adults.

The music by Michael J. Lewis is also a highlight which is full of light and fits the scenes perfectly.

There are two versions of this movie available on DVD. In an unusual move the cheaper of the two is actually better. Whereas the more expensive version clocking in at just under $25 has only some trailers, the cheaper one (for about $14 or less) has information on Lewis and the Narnia books).  Certainly the cover and menu's may be better on the more expensive one, but other than that the cheaper version is the easier one to recommend.",1147996800,,3476,4.864406779661017
2423402,5,B000BKVRME,"This has been a favorite of mine since I was a child. It inspired me to read the children's novel on which it was based many times as a child, as well as purchase the other books in the Chronicles Of Narnia series. I think the filmmakers did a superb job. In fact, when I saw the recent motion picture ""Chronicles of Narnia"", I found it lacking in areas. Sure, it was an excellent movie, but this 1979 cartoon version of the classic portrayed the killing of Aslan much more realistically like a crucifixtion and was actually almost too disturbing for children, whereas the film was sugar-coated in that aspect. I reccomend this cartoon to adults or wise children who want to see and feel the true poignancy of the classic. You'll never feel the same eating turkish delight. : )",1146355200,,777,4.5177304964539005

He definitely reminds me of Christ.

I think there is nothing to criticize; it's a classic story, showed in a version really close to the book, and I believe many parts of the movie that was released now were based on this old cartoon, as some of its scenes were completely identic.

The only thing which disappointed me a little was the fact that there wasn't any subtitle, not even in English, but I loved it anyway.",1140739200,,544,4.221153846153846

The transfer here isn't great but is watchable (its comparable in quality to the DVD of ""The Last Unicorn."")

If you're looking forward to reliving 70's TV memories or just want a respectable rendition of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe to tide you over until Disney's ""Chronicles of Narnia"" DVD hits stores, you can't lose with this release.",1136937600,,648,4.828828828828829

2423412,3,B000BKVRME,"Like many of you out there, I am a dedicated CS Lewis fan, and so when I chanced to see this DVD release, I couldn't hold myself back. I had seen this film throughout childhood, and so seeing it on my shelf now brings warm memories to my heart. It is a true shame that the good people that brought us this wonderful piece of delight never afforded the effort to deliver us others, such as Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair, etc.

Much like the BBC versions, which covered only the titles mentioned above, this particular version remained wholly loyal to the book, implementing the dialogue and scenes as they were. There is only a slight alteration, however, in which Lucy recounts, through memory, her journey through the Wardrobe. While I am not a pure loyalist to original works when it comes to transfers from book to movie, as I liked the changes done in the 2005 Narnia movie (just not the stuff that they left out), I find this particular change of pace to be rather annoying.

I was disappointed with this specific DVD edition. It appears as though there was no effort to clean up the original film before making the digital transfer. Dirt blotches can be seen spewed about the screen from the first opening shot until the closing. For some buyers, this sort of quality won't matter much, while, to others, it will no doubt irritate beyond belief. I like to consider myself somewhere in the middle of the two, and so, while the irritation is present in the opening act, it typically fades as the movie progresses, and so there is only little harm done.

Unfortunitely, my disapointment doesn't end there. If you happen to shop for this DVD in a store, you will undoubtedly notice that the back of the box advertises special features. The bio on CS Lewis had my attention, as well as facts on this particular movie/story. The special features were, however, several, if not less, power point presentations that had probably been put together by an intern at lunch break, no joke.

Parents, it is quite possible that your children loved the 2005 Narnia movie so much that they can't wait until it is released on DVD, and possibly have even seen it on the shelves of a local Wal Mart store (or wherever else it is sold, I found it there), and so begged to have it. While I can't speak for the specific taste of your child, I often wonder if many children today can connect with this version at all. The artwork is, well, very vintage 1970's (1979 precisely), and nowhere near the quality of modern children's entertainment. This particular movie reminds me of the Hobbit and Return of the King cartoons from the 70's, and should fit nicely on the shelf next to them.

However much I loved this film as a child, it is because of the mistakes mentioned above that I cannot give the movie a 5 star rating, as much as I'd like to, but feel as though I must lower it to a 3. If you feel as though you can hurdle over these obstacles, by all means, watch it; you will certainly be enriched for having done so.

For those of you looking for an excellent Narnia companion to the movie, Focus on the Family published a wonderful Radio Drama series on the entire Chronicles, hosted by Douglas Grisham. This series is a pure delight, and your child (or you and your spouse), will certainly find enchantment in these imaginative episodes.",1134950400,,3366,4.537067545304778
2423413,5,B000BKVRME,I have always loved this movie.  You may have noticed that there is a more pricey version.  I think it was from an earlier printing and this cheaper version just came out.  Anyway I have purchased both (one was a present for someone else) and I think the cheaper version (this one) is better.  The other one cost me 24.99 and this one cost me 8.99 at walmart.  As far as the movie itself goes they are the same.  The cheaper one has better extras though. It has info on Lewis and the books while the more expense version just has trailers for other products.  So stick with this version and save a few bucks for a better product. I imagine the other one will be going out of print soon if they are now selling this one.,1134432000,,719,4.166666666666667

The dvd for this one claimed to be 5 mintues longer, but I checked and that wasn't the case.  The cheaper version has better extras too.  This one only has a few trailers for some other products while the cheaper one actually has information on Lewis and the various books.  Its not a  huge amount of extras, but better then just some trailers.  The only thing I did like better on the more pricey version is the presentation.  The cover looks better, the menues looke better, etc.  Not a huge deal though, more of a personal preference.  So look for the other verion, amazon sells it too.",1134432000,,832,4.3441558441558445
2423415,5,B000BKVRME,"I remember seeing this movie on CBS  when I was about 7-8.  My mother had just finished reading the book to my brother and I and we couldn't wait to watch it. It was wonderful the story went with the book fairly well. The animation was fine for the early eigthies as well.  It was broadcast over a two night period.  On the first night it ended when  Aslan was killed on the stone table.  Then it finished from there the second night.

When I heard that Disney/Walden were going to release a live action version I was estatic and wanted to see the animated version from my youth to bring back fond memories. When I fond this version I was shocked to find it was only ninety minutes long. Time goes by slower when you are a child but it appears to me now that the TV network extended it by adding commercials. I did go on to read the other books but this one has always stuck with me as being the best one. You can not go wrong by watching it and introducing your children to the wonderful world of Narnia.",1133913600,,1005,4.149484536082475

2423425,4,B000BKVRME,"This pioneering 1979 TV adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel falls way way short in terms of technical accomplishment, but still has much to recommend it.

The animation is extremely crude, even by the standards of the day.  Director Bill Melendez is a veteran in the field of animation (he worked on the great Warner Bros. cartoons and both produced and provided the voice of Snoopy for the beloved Charlie Brown specials), but he was clearly working with very limited resources.  Some of the script's most effective concepts (Mr. Tumnus's hypnosis of Lucy, the vision of Narnia's destruction conjured by the Witch, the crash of thunder at the moment of Aslan's death) are undercut by poor visual realization.  Uneven voice work by most of the cast and a few inappropriate and badly executed sight gags don't help.

These technical shortcomings may make it difficult for many viewers today to appreciate the accomplishment of the film.  The screenplay (attributed to Melendez and Children's Television Workshop writer David D. Connell) elegantly streamlines Lewis's story while remaining true to both the word and spirit of the text.  The music, by Welsh composer Michael J. Lewis, is beautiful and evocative.  Some of the background paintings are really lovely.  The stylized medium of animation helps give the central character of Aslan a gravitas that is difficult to replicate in live action (compare the BBC's failure to portray a talking lion effectively, although that production has many other virtues), and the sound design gives a nice aura to Stephen Thorne's voice work.

The BBC version really has to be the standard screen adaptation, at least until we have a chance to gauge the success of Disney and Walden Media's effort in December 2005.  However, viewers and Lewis fans who can look beyond the surface flaws should also find much to appreciate in this version.",1105056000,,1885,5.067961165048544

In my humble opinion, the animation is perfect.  I don't think we could do the story any better justice today, with all our special fx.

I was a preschooler in 1979 when this came out.  I still remember watching it and being utterly captivated with the evil of the White Witch and the beauty and power of Aslan.  The story spoke to me so strongly that I can still see the entire thing in my head almost 25 years later, having only seen it once more since.
