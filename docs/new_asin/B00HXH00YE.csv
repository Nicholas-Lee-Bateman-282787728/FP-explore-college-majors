6242759,1,B00HXH00YE,"To any serious marvel fans, please don't waste your money on this rubbish.

The writing of this is some of the worst of clich&eacute; riddled, stereo-typing hyperbolic nonsense I've had the misfortune in watching.

I got about 35 minutes into it before switching it off in disgust as it was so bad. The characters are so two dimensional and the animation so poor that cardboard cut outs of an old marvel comic moved by stop capture animation would have been better than this drivel.

Why do they get these awful writers to ruin what could be potentially good stories is beyond me?

Outsourcing marvel content to Japanese style animae producers is a serious mistake. If you like animae, then perhaps this might float your boat but if you want less nausea inducing bollocks then stay well away from this.

I want marvel productions to be as good as the 2 animated Ultimate films that came out 8 years ago, not this garbage.",1394496000,9,921,4.660493827160494
6242760,4,B00HXH00YE,"Hello to start lets first get this out.... there is nothing wrong with the animated movies from either company (DC & MARVEL)
now it is true that they both like to produce adaptations  of old comic book stories, lets look at why... there must be a reason... after you have been a fan as long as i have you can easily see the why... because that is where the best stories are created... if your are watching these movies then you must also be a fan, so being a fan of the comic book amazing wonder land  since 1975 i can tell you without any hesitation that the childhood fan that lives in me loves seeing those stories come to vivid life. the story writers of today have a tough time finding new things to keep the heroes and villians interesting... writers like Geoff Johns,ed brubaker,grant morrison,mark waid,Jeph Loeb, Petter David just to name a few have given us some of the greatest adventures in the comic medium that a true fan can ask for. so (MICHAEL) if you do not like what your are reading or watching then you really can not call your self a true fan of this business and i would suggest you to stick with thing like twilight or young in the restless and leave the reast of us fans (if i may be so bold to speak for the rest of us ) alone thank you and have a nice day.

6242761,1,B00HXH00YE,"As the activities director for the local Network Alliance Meeting Boys Loving Amusement it is my responsibility to keep our DVD and Blu-ray library up to date. This was definitely a movie that looked like a worthwhile addition.  Upon doing research online, with my computer, using real Wi-Fi, in my van, parked in a park, at night, all by myself,  I was able to find a synopsis that gave me a good enough idea of what to expect.
""After interfering with a top secret mission, the Punisher is taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent and Avenger, Black Widow. At the orders of Director Nick Fury, Punisher and Black Widow are sent on a mission to stop Leviathan, a global terrorist organization that plans to sell stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. technology to the highest bidder. Now, the vigilante and spy must work together to prevent this technology from falling into the wrong hands. The fate of the world, and of the Avengers, hangs in the balance."" -Written by Anonymous on Internet Media Data Base
  (I too can copy and paste)
However, upon actually viewing the movie, I found the quality of animation sorely lacking in contrast to the cover art. For that, I must give it one star for its deceptive presentation.",1392768000,7,1205,4.751196172248804
6242762,5,B00HXH00YE,"Retread?... Theyre called adaptations and the idea is to present the story in a medium that the story has not been presented in before. Just because you (Im talking to you Michael) have read this a million times or whatever(interesting since you refer to this as DC animation and this is not a DC production.) Does not mean others have. If you don't like it then don't watch it. Furthermore you... and WE should not be putting these comments in product reviews when WE clearly have not seen the product yet. Its a disservice to those that are hoping to gain insight on said product, especially when you negatively reflect this film without ever having seen it. If you choose to view this and then don't enjoy it... then by all means, feel free to enlighten us with yiur opinion.  But don't you have anything better to do than troll amazon product reviews because you THINK you won't like a movie? Both Marvel and DC animation houses have put out fine feature films... and frankly, I believe DCs are actually better. Not a slight on Marvels, just my opinion on how damn good DCs are. And I have seen all of them. Not totally relevant to thus particular film either. But felt it was pertinent to your slight on DC animation in the midst of your slanderous view on this Marvel film you have yet to see via your misleading opinion of DC in the midst of it. Fyi to anyone who is looking for an objective opinion of this film. Thus far Marvel has failed to disappoint. Theyve ranged from good to great.

This is going to be yet ANOTHER retread of previous material that was in comic book. It's just been done SOOOO many times before. DC is LOUSY with direct to video rehashes of comic stories. SO many you would think that DC animation wouldn't know a original story if it fell on its head! And now a rehash of the marvel ULTIMATE line story.

6242775,3,B00HXH00YE,"I flipped this on while I was doing some work at night and boy was it weird.  You basically have the general idea of the marvel characters, some of which are closer to the characters we know from movies or comics, and some of which are just so different.  The animation and the dialogue are pure Japanese anime; while I enjoyed seeing the familiar characters drawn in a different art style, the dialogue was so, so awkward.  I really did not like how Black Widow was portrayed and I though Punisher was as one dimensional as anything I've ever seen.

As a parent, it was ultra violent, so the PG-13 rating is appropriate.

It's tough to recommend this as anything more than a rental.  I don't imagine I'd ever watch it again.  I hope this review helps you make a decision.",1454457600,,772,4.432624113475177

6242780,3,B00HXH00YE,"Marvels track record compared to DCs in the animation department (both feature length and serialized) continues to pale and Avengers Confidential: Black Widow & Punisher does absolutely nothing to challenge DCs animated dominance.  This is coming from a Marvel fanboy.  In order to enjoy this movie you have to be able to enjoy that manga inspired anime style of animation which usually continues super quick edited action pieces and characters with large eyes and small mouths (and, if they are female, often large assets).  The animation is the best thing about this feature and there are several nice hand-to-hand combat moments involving both the Black Widow against Punisher and the two versus others.  One of the best moments is when Punisher, being mind-controlled, lashes out against SHIELD and takes out a lot of men and threatens to take out the Widow.  Fans of the Punisher will likely feel this film does him justice as he is one bad mother.  On the flip side you have a greatly softened and unusually vulnerable Black Widow.  Voiced by Jennifer Carpenter BW here certainly has the chops to kick backsides but her edges are burnished by giving her a lovers heartbreak backstory and allowing her to be the emotionally expressive counterpoint to the Punishers/ Frank Castles one-note practically sociopathic killing machine (by the by for any parents that might wonder the feature earns its PG-13 rating via the blood and violence and killing).  Perhaps thats what the writers were going for when they paired these two up?  Showing the archetype masculine animus in the Punisher and the feminine anima in the Widow and how when the two blend they can accomplish what the other cant?  Thats a huge stretch and I doubt it, especially as one gets the feeling that the Punisher might have been able to take care of most of the business by himself.  The continued humanizing of Natasha Romanova seems to be in service not to her origin or what type of person her training would likely turn her into but Hollywoods sanitized version of super spy and assassin.

The story is about SHIELD finding some thugs using advanced SHIELD weaponry and tracing the suppliers back to an espionage agency, LEVIATHAN, working toward global instability.  Who isnt, right?  After the Punisher is easily brainwashed and attacks SHIELD he is drafted by them to go after the real killers.  Fine by him but the Black Widow tags along as his chaperone/ oversight.  The two cant manage to work in tandem because Castle won't take orders from Romanova, but they storm the (literal) castle and find that a former SHIELD employee and ex-lover of Romanova (whos developed some spiffy fighting abilities through bio-tech) heads up the organization that is working for someonebigger.  Finally enter the Avengers at the end of the film to break up a glorified multi-villain arms deal before everyone lives happily ever afterexcept for the saddened Widow.  Youd figure with the word confidential in the title youd get at least a little noir-ish corrupted love or seedy Avengers history but no, sadly.

Avengers Confidential capitalizes on the Avengers name by throwing them in almost as an afterthought.  I thought that the story would have been far more interesting if they allowed Romanova to be equally as tough and masculine (no need to draw her that way though) as Castle and have the two bicker and squabble like an old married couple and try to one-up each other.  Or to pair up Cap and the Punisher and have Cap constantly put Punisher in his place.  The feature is pretty standard comic book fare with some good animation.  Maybe its greatly disappointing to some, but not as horrible as a lot of people have made it out to be.  Temper your expectations and itll be worth you view when you get around to it.  No rush though.",1442966400,,3806,4.863565891472868

I thought I saw Speed Racer characters pop up during this movie.  It was a sad, sad joke of a ""Marvel"" movie.  No one--I mean NO ONE--was in character.  They made Black Widow act like a sassy Voltron pilot.  They made the Punisher a weak, Pokemon herder of a man.

6242792,4,B00HXH00YE,Great to see the interactions between Black Widow and the Punisher the first fight scene they had was my best part of the movie. Just didn't like the whole love interest story line in the movie seems like anytime you have a up front female lead in a movie she always forms some love interest with one of the male characters. Apparently they did the same thing to Black Widow in the new live action Avengers movie between her and the Hulk.

6242794,2,B00HXH00YE,"Frank Castle should get a restraining order against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers because he should have never been dragged into this mess of a direct-to-video movie.

While in principle, The Punisher and Black Widow *should* make a great pairing, this movie went in directions The Punisher just didn't belong. As a Punisher fan his material should be dark and gritty, no-holds-barred violence, with a bit of a detective pulp noir armosphere. He isn't about getting involved with super villain plots to take over the world or thwarting the evil clone army machinations of baddies out to do battle with the Earth's mightiest heroes. No. So what is Frank doing in this Avengers movie? He's so out of place, they may as well paired Black Widow with Howard the Duck.

When not with the Avengers, Black Widow is a vastly more down-to-earth super spy and assassin. With that kind of background it should have been a snap to weave a story where her's and The Punisher's paths crossed and combined into one of mutual blood-soaked interest. One would think that would have been the direction MAD House would gone with this pairing when pitching this story. Unfortunately they got too caught up in their permission to use the Avengers franchise and its characters. While I wouldn't have been opposed to one or two of the other Avengers putting in a cameo appearance (Hawkeye or Cap would fit in well depending on the story), The Punisher has no business sharing the same screen with Iron Man, the Hulk, or Thor (though was kind of nice to see Captain Marvel getting some attention, even if very limited). Frank is *not* Batman. He doesn't hang with super heroes, nor does he get along with them (barring his association with the Thunderbolts, which ended badly for them due to Frank's inability to play nice with others).

This offering was a terrible waste of a vastly solid potential for what could have been a truly great movie.",1433203200,2,1921,4.7975830815709966

6242847,4,B00HXH00YE,"I am a big Avengers fan so this animated movie was good for me.  The animation techniques are a bit dated and the story line is lacking in detail.

The story line is a bit lacking in any real character / plot development.  We find out unlikely information important to the story line as the story rolls along.  That is everything just seems very coincidental and ""staged"" for the sole purpose of providing a twist to the ending.  Don't know how else to describe it better without giving things away except to say it left me feeling a little disappointed these facts couldn't have been done earlier in a sub-story or are commonly known information from the comics/movies.  Kind of reminds me of a soap opera plot twist...

I still give this movie four stars from the perspective of a real Avenges fan.  The animation isn't all that bad and  Ian live with the story line ""twists"".  For those not into Avengers I would demote this to three stars due to the ""quaint"" animation quality and subpar story line.

I just think the characters can use less drama and dialog in the tough talking before they engage each other in a fight. It can so drawn out and make you yawn. The action and fight sequences are great and the graphics also, but like any Anime feature there is too much dialog that can be dragged out to make you want to hit the pause button and grab a snack or soda. I thought using Punisher and Black Widow was nicely done to create a different story arc and then bring in the Avengers later in the story was a awesome spectacle.

The ""anime""-tion (as another review aptly called it was more like a bad motion comic than an animated feature. Backgrounds are static. Even worse, the characters are static.

He's a product of an age past, NYC 80's.  When NYC was a cesspit and no one cared people were pushed to a breaking point and the City That Never Sleeps was like a 3rd world country.  Punisher was created for all of us who were scared to walk in the street, ride the subway and frustrated that those in power were the corrupt.  He became an outlaw for the people in order to do one thing, take down the organized crime that ruled this town and kept the streets under their thumb.  He is an incredibly relevant and under used.

6242856,4,B00HXH00YE,"It seems odd that stories derived from comic books have made such a huge splash in reality based movies over the past few years but not quite in animated films. The comic book medium seems to be a no brainer when it comes to crossing into animation. And yet many of the animated movies based on comics haven't achieved near the same success. That being the case it's still nice to see some comic book companies still trying to combine the two and make a successful animated film. Marvel does just that this week with the release of AVENGERS CONFIDENTIAL: BLACK WIDOW AND PUNISHER.

Background on the two main characters is needed to understand them before the film starts, some of this on display in the opening credits sequence. Natasha Romanov aka Black Widow, was raised from childhood in Russia to be their top assassin. Years later she learned of the reality behind what they had done to her, switched sides and now works for S.H.I.E.L.D. as one of their top spies. Frank Castle was an ex-Marine turned policeman whose family was killed by the mob. Since that time he has taken on the mantle of The Punisher dressed in black with a skull on his chest intent on wiping out any and every criminal underworld character he can. While they rarely come into contact in comics they find themselves thrown together in this film.

Castle is in the midst of taking down a group of criminals led by Caine when Black Widow shows up and tries to stop him. While most of the criminals die at Castle's hand, Caine escapes and Castle is captured by Widow whose objective was to take him before her commander, Nick Fury the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury informs Castle that he's ruined an operation that's been going on for months. It seems that Caine was tied into a group called Leviathan, a terrorist organization made up of ex-Russian military leaders intent on world domination. Using stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. technology they are developing and selling arms to the highest bidder.

In Castle's mind he doesn't care. His only objective is to take down the low life criminals who kills innocent people. Fury's objective is to follow those players to the source and win the entire war, not just a single battle. Both want the bad guy but are going at it from different angles. Fury offers Castle a chance to come on board with the plan and find Leviathan and put an end to the terror as long as he'll work with Widow. Castle agrees, sort of, refusing to take orders.

The duo follow track Caine using a bug that Castle planted on him during the initial fight that opened the film. The secret that it leads to, jus how developed the plan is that Leviathan has formed and the personal interests that involved the Black Widow makes for some emotional sequences as well as a deeper secret than we were led to believe from the information Fury had. Just how the pair will overcome their differences and put an end to Leviathan makes up the rest of the film.

Make no mistake about it, this is not comics from the sixties or earlier. Comics changed during the eighties and nineties taking on a more adult tone. This was in part because their audience was aging, becoming older. The adult market makes up a bigger part of their sales now than children. Not only is the story and themes used here more adult in nature, the violence is as well. Within seconds of the movie starting we witness Castle cut the throat of one thug and gun down many more in cold blood. Make note of this before allowing your children to watch this movie.

That warning aside this film plays out more like James Bond than Captain America. The combination of spy and vigilante make for an interesting story that moves along at a quick pace that doesn't allow time for relaxation. Fans of thrillers that seem to take up book racks everywhere will enjoy the storyline here as well as the action. Fans of comics will be glad to see the Avengers on screen once again (even if it does come towards the end of the film).

On the whole this film is quite enjoyable and will entertain fans and non-fans alike. While I'm not a big fan of anime style animation, it didn't affect what is going on here on screen at all. It actually worked well with what happens here. In the end viewers will get a solid film with adult themes that take place in a comic book reality. Heroes and villains are not black and white but shades of gray, sort of like the real world. Comic fans will add it to their shelves while all others have a chance to escape for 83 minutes.",1400630400,,4495,4.507975460122699
6242857,2,B00HXH00YE,"While the graphics are pretty good this soap opera meets anime train wreck of a story was just too difficult to watch. Drama is a requirement of the genre but melodrama is not and melodrama was dished out much too liberally.  The time spent on the Black Widow and Elias relationship as well as throwing in the unnecessary and cliche' Amadeus boy genius character could have been spent productively developing an interesting back story and much better dialogue.

For anyone who has a preference for Anime the ""acting"" and dialog is probably familiar territory. A main problem I had with this was the inexplicable changes in Black Widows attitude towards Elias and Elias' instantaneous change in behavior. I can accept the ""I became an evil SOB so I could have power""  premise but I could not accept the ""I love you so I became an evil SOB, killed people, and became a traitor so you'd love me back"". That was just over the top melodramatic garbage.

The story came across as inconsistent and choppy as though 3 or 4 directors were involved and each of them got to select areas they would direct without consulting with the others.

i am usually pretty forgiving with most Marvel and DC video's but this one was bad enough that I did something I rarely do, I stopped it around 1 hour and 10 minutes.  As one of the bad guys asks ""Really, is that the best you can do?"". The answer is no and Marvel needs to step up its game in the animation genre.",1400630400,,1444,4.49236641221374

The only good thing is Punisher from beginning to end. He's mean, he's interesting and he shows himself to not just be a maniac killing criminals.

6242862,4,B00HXH00YE,"I was rather surprised by the overall quality of this animated feature. Especially when comparing it to other movies like the Hulk and Iron man or the Iron Man: Rise of the Technovore. The Avengers Confidential definitely shows being able to go back to the quality of animation and stories from when Lionsgate did Planet Hulk or the Ultimate Avengers.

The animation is very good. The script was alright, it does work as a side story and fleshes out the character of Black Widow better so she stands on her own rather than a support character. Punisher wasn't too bad, he came off as a bit dry and too cliched at points. I personally didn't care for the kid scientist character of Amadeus. I felt he could have been left out or just the one scene he's in and that's it.

It's a clear don't discount Marvel's ability to produce and have good direct to dvd animated movies completely. This is clearly on the right track for keeping  pace with the quality of animated movies coming from DC that people are used to seeing and want.

A die-hard anime fan might enjoy this film, but if you're a die-hard anime fan, you've seen much better anime than this.",1399420800,,449,5.0
6242864,5,B00HXH00YE,"Bottom line is, if you are a Punisher fan you really have no choice and need to see this. He has some excellent kills and some classic ""Frank Castle"" moments.

So, yea.

I read Marvel pretty heavily so I can objectively say I'm a fare judge of these characters.

Frank had a bit too much self pity, which was out of character. And there's a point where his iron willpower is overcome, which is generally also out of character for him. But other than that he was terrifying. I felt pretty bad for the crooks and thugs standing in his way. Frank had amazing action in this anime.

Natasha was written as a waifu (cutey pie you could imagine dating) and was super sappy, so she was generally always way out of character. She plays the role of balance, often telling Frank to hold back on the brutality, etc etc. This is also out of character for her because she is an assassin for hire. However, she also had some good action.

The real kicker for me is that towards the end the director seemed to put his fan hat on and tosses some great characters at you. I seriously did not expect to see these lineups. Very cool and very powerful characters. I'm talking guys who could take down Magneto.

The anime style fits the Marvel action real well. The writing was a bit too ""anime"" lol.

5 stars b/c 5 apparently means ""I love it"", and I love to see Frank do his thing.",1399334400,2,1362,4.296875
6242865,4,B00HXH00YE,"Following up Iron Man: Rise Of Technovore from a year prior, Marvel Anime continues its line with this, their second full-length movie. Having already done four TV series that were slightly connected and taking place in their own version of the Marvel Universe, this time we switch gears to a team-up with two of the comics' regular solo-artists. Even though it says ""Avengers"" in the title, it mostly centers around The Punisher and Black Widow, Agent of SHIELD.

 Punisher captures Cain, an arms dealer, but Black Widow and SHIELD appear to take Punisher in for getting in the way of their investigation of Cain's supplier, a terrorist organization known as Leviathan(no relation to the DC Comics group of the same name). Nick Fury makes a deal with Punisher for him to help SHIELD capture Leviathan by teaming up with Widow to track them down. The unlikely duo sneak into Leviathan's base where Widow is shocked to discover their whole operation is being supervised by Elihas Starr, a former SHIELD scientist who was presumed dead, and only happened to be Widow's lover. Now, he's enhanced himself as well as an army of kidnapped spies into super-soldiers using DNA taken from various members of the Avengers. Elihas did this for Leviathan so that he would be worthy of being with Widow because the fact she was a super-spy and an Avenger can make a fella feel inadequate, although faking your own death and selling out to terrorists is a little extreme. Widow and Punisher barely make it out alive with a peace of Leviathan's tech used to brainwash spies, which Punisher was exposed to temporarily turning him into killing machine. SHIELD's resident techie, Amadeus Cho, manages to create some special shades that block out the hypno-rays. They then find out Leviathan is holding a special auction for their super-soldiers on Madripoor(which was the location for about half of the Wolverine anime series)for a bunch of supervillains. Widow and Punisher head out there first to sabotage their efforts, and then the rest of the Avengers show up, including: Iron-Man, Captain Marvel(formally Ms. Marvel), Thor, and War Machine, but still no Spider-Man! Widow runs into Eliahas and convinces him to turn against Leviathan, so they go to take on his boss, Orion. Elihas ends up being killed in the fight, but Punisher shows up to put a knife right in Orion's one eye. In the vein of Blade II, the movie ends with Punisher tracking down Cain for a final kill.

This was a pretty decent extension of the Marvel Universe, although not totally related to the comics or any of the live-action movies. It has some great direction by Kenichi Shimizu and the rest of the Madhouse crew, with exceptionally fine details to the characters and vibrant fight scenes. You can see this movie on its own without having seen any of the other Marvel Anime stuff, although its a great successor to the series as a whole so far.",1399075200,5,2907,4.845070422535211
6242866,5,B00HXH00YE,"Well when I first watched this movie I actully didn't care much for it.  I had actully daydreamed through the end of the film.  Well I felt that I had to watch it agian just to understand what happened, I had day dreamed through the final battle @_@

Well the 2nd time I watched it I actully enjoyed it, mostly the parts with the Punisher, he is the best character in this movie because he is my fav and his part in the story is very entertaining.  I think youll agree on the last point even if you don't care much for the Punisher.

Well while watching it for the 2nd time I had noticed plot points that I found interesting about the villians I missed before and I just loved seeing the Punisher in action, needless to say he kicks alot of butt close, but not exact, to how the Thomas Jane and Garth Punishers would, which is like fast no nonsence killer ( like a NAVY SEAL) and not some crazed stand up fighting brawler like Ray Stevens Punisher was alot how the Punisher is potrayed in fan films.

I like how they potrayed Frank in this story despite being judge jury and executioner, he still hasn't lost his humility.  He could have killed the super powered enemies but didn't because it was pointed out to him those soldiers were just as much as victoms as his family that was killed in a fowled mob hit.  JFYI the Avengers that show up didn't care that those people were under a mind control and destroyed those guys anyway  @_@  Bit of a bumber there.

It was great seeing frank along side the Avengers at the end.  JFYI this movie is a seq to the animated Iron Man film and Frank hasn't forgotten that Tony ruined his last outpost.. Its apretty funny scene I won't spoil it :)

As far as the Black Widow goes she was cool both in design voice acting and character.  Her part of the plot was not bad...  It is strange though...

Everything about Frank was awesome in this movie, a major improvement over the design in the Iron Man film.  The voice actor is good BUT the had a guy play Frank in the Iron Man film that sounded like Thomas Jane but not in this movie.  Its a shame they didn't have that actor come back and play as Frank agian.

The other Avengers in this movie are Ms. Marvel XD , Hawkeye (my 2nd fav Avenger), Iron Man (he was cool I just wish he could have done more with frank, War Machine (it was sweet to see him but he was barelly in the film), Hulk (meh...),  Thor (yawn).  The coolest Avenger to show up was Ms. Marvel as Captain Marvel.  She fought Baron Mordo in this film and some how redirected his magical attack lol

The villians overall were pretty cool esp Orion.  The group called Leviathan is a Russian super terror group that looks pretty cool.  My only complaint is the 2nd in Command character that you see more than any other enemy in this film.  On one hand they did a good job potraying a emotionaly unstable character with a major infererority complex that suffers from delsusions about self worth and what is required of him to quote unquote be loved.  He had the girl the whole time his mind just didn't let him see that, which really means he didnt.  Even after things are mended he talks to her like he still has to fight to get her and obsessis over talking about her infront of other people as if only her life matters, even doing so in a speach to Orion even after being hit with a attack that will cause him to die.

Now unless you are engaged or married you never do what he did or talk like he did too Black Widow or infront of her about her because you will give off the vibe you are needy, selfloathing, and obsessive.  Women HATE that as a Guy I can say I hate it when/if Women do that to.  To top it off he trys killing her before having there talk to fix things.... Dont do that ether in a relationship...

The finale fight was freaking awesome the onlything I would have changed is cut Franks lines.

I choose 5 stars because I feel this a great movie for many reasons.  The plot, animation, most the characters are awesome, character development is great for Frank, Widow in relation to Frank was good I think she crushes on him at the end but can you blame her?  Her true love tried to reunite with her then beat her to death, then repeated step one and two, then did step one agian but was succesfulish, and then wouldnt shut up about his love for her even while fight the main vilian while she is standing next to him... And bfore he dies acts like he failed steep one which was to get Widow back with him @_@

Well Widows plot involving her crazy not real boyfriend can be considered good if you use those parts as a information reel for signs your partner is crazy and hates themselves and may kill you in your sleep... @_@
Despite that the movie gets better the more times you see it and the more people you watch it with.  Heck I am sure you can make some sort of non-alcholic drinking game were you take shoots when creepo says something creepy and selfabsorbed about his realationship with Black Widow his mind won't let him have, and then he tries to kill her...

I say non-alcholic because that way you won't miss the great parts of the film.  THE PARTS WITH THE PUNISHER!!!",1398988800,5,5149,4.252826310380267

First, this is an overdone Japanse ""anime"" style where the animation is often minimal, perhaps to cut costs. The animation and acting are often over the top. For a movie about Black Widow & Punisher, there's a lot of focus on Black Widow and her former lover, turned villain, and sadly, it's not all that interesting. Their back and forth conversations seemed rehashed in between fighting.

Honestly, Marvel can turn out good animation. The Television animations of Avengers, including the latest Avengers Assemble have much better acting, stories and animation. Maybe this was an experiment to see if the anime style would work. If so, I hope they don't do it again or they tame it down.

The story is a basic ""super soldier"" sort of plot. Nothing amazing, but not terrible. This could have been good, but it wasn't.",1398211200,,1037,4.718232044198895

DC has owned the animation side for a long time.  DC shows like Batman the animated series, the original Justice League, JLA unlimited, etc. etc.  Then there is the animated movies...Batman Year One, JLA New Frontier, Flash Paradox, etc.  A lot of good animation.

What's Marvel animation done so far?  Work with Japanese Manga and Anime houses have given great LOOKING animation, but the stories have been hackneyed and incoherent.  They showed a lot of promise with the Ultimates Avengers, and Avengers 2, but not so much recently.

The art style is pretty good, and the voice acting for the most part is spot on. However the main villain is very very weak and the entire storyline is weak. There are some pretty good fight scenes but overall the movie is lacking good action. I feel the pairing of the Punisher and Widow was just a bad move. A Widow and Hawkeye movie would have been better. I suggest renting this if you're a Marvel fan. Its not worth the cost",1397433600,,580,4.481132075471698
6242890,1,B00HXH00YE,"First off, I'm a marvel guy and aside from loving the Batman character, always will be. Let me just say...this was really a disappointment.

1st - The anime art style is something they really need to get rid of, it's not catchy and does nothing to help the feel of the movie. Black Widow looked like one of the Anime cartoon girls with her face looking really awkward at times, and everything looked like it was straight out of the late 80's early 90's anime era. For goodness sake the boy genius in the movies dog looks like a pokemon (I really wish I was joking about that...I'm really not)

2nd - The story was not good...It was a giant soap opera (and not in a good way). Black Widow having boyfriend issues being one of the center themes?? Common people, talk about lazy writing. Yes there were parts where the Punisher was brutal as he should be, but for the most part the entire plot/story was not good. The main characters Black Widow and Punisher end up needing the Avengers to help them at the end? Why not just have the Avengers on the case from the start? They tried to explain that but even that made no sense....

3rd - The voice acting was bleh. I wasn't as offended as some others, but some of it was brutal. Punisher was passable, Black Widows was not good and the boy genius in the movie I was hoping would die because he was super annoying.

When will Marvel learn from DC on how to properly do animated movies? As much as I dislike DC with the exception of the Batman Universe in the comics, their animated feature movies blow Marvel out of the water and it's not even close.

Save your money on this, it's not worth your time and effort. And don't be deceived by the cover, you maybe get 5-10 minutes TOTAL of the hulk, iron man and thor and is quick actions sequences, they aren't in 90% of the movie.",1397347200,3,1823,4.303206997084548

Now the movie's not great (yes this story has been told a million times before), it's also not garbage (if it's been told a million times before it's because the formula works). It's entertaining to say the least. Punisher gets recruited by SHIELD and teams up with Widow to find out who's behind Leviathan (a group of bad guys). Once they unravel all the secrecy and figure out where to strike they call for the big guns to help out. The Avengers, minus Cap, show up to wade through the bad guys... and that's all they do. Iron Man is the only Avenger with any lines. The rest just stomp on the bad guys.

6242909,1,B00HXH00YE,"If you like Madhouses animation style, then you will like the look of this movie.  But that may be all you like.

The villains motivation for all that he does wrong is because he wants to be worthy of Black Widows love?  As just a poor Shield scientist, he thinks himself inadequate for her  even though she keeps telling him she loves him for who he is?  Couldnt he just had a talk with her and explained himself?  Did he really have to fake his death, steal a bunch of Shield secrets, and join an international crime organization so he could finish turning himself into a super solider?  And we are supposed to believe The Black Widow actually loved this nut job?  Really?  What we have here is a poorly written high school romance with super heroes and villains knocking each other around.

And because it is an anime (which I generally like), we have the obligatory teenage slacker genius that is no good with girls and is a slob, a cute little dog (think Ein from Cowboy Beebop with bigger ears) he has as his pet in the super-secret Shield laboratory and then said teenager riding the back of the Hulk during much of the end fight.  That should be no problem, right?  The Hulk loves to smash things while a teenager hangs on to his shoulders.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the script is not well done.  The English voice actors did OK with what they were given, but yikes, the dialog!

So how about a box score then?

Visuals: its Madhouse and you either love them or hate them.  Black Widows character is definitely drawn/presented for the younger males.  There are many fan service shots of her upper torso.

Music/sound: Didnt really pay attention to the music, but it was not a distraction.  All the explosions/gun shots/sound effects/etc. were done well.

Voice acting:  A low passing grade.

Script/Dialog: Fail.

Story/Plot: Fail.

S*** gets blown up.) My main problem is with the main villain, who'd be awesome with a completely different personality and motivation. Basically, he felt jealous that Black Widow was always kicking @$$ and saving the world, as superheroes tend to do, and as such he, a mere scientist wasn't good enough for her. So he uses superhuman blood to give him powers to measure up(immoral, but not EVIL...) then goes to work for a terrorist group who partake in every crime that they can profit from.(Well, he went off the deep end like a ton of bricks...) Ams dealing, drug dealing, human trafficking, you name it, they do it. He repeatedly insists he's doing what he's doing for her, and that's really all you get. There's no stated reason why he snapped, why exactly he doesn't see what's wrong with his actions, or why he doesn't expect her to see what's wrong with them. His redemption is just as cheap. All it took for him to come to his senses was a couple beatings and a heart-to-heart talk. It's really disappointing since they've done motivations and personalities just fine before. In The Rise of Technovore, there was clearly something very wrong with Ezekiel. He was like an insane child, completely out-of-touch with reality and had been like that for quite some time, and in the X-Men Anime, Dr. Sasaki was trying to cure a loved one and felt a great deal of remorse for what she had done. Both of these characters felt real, you could see that one was a boy whose mind had warped over time and one was a person in desperation, the villain here just doesn't make sense. His character, as well as the extremely clichd dialogue throughout the movie costs it two stars, in my opinion,(one and 6/8's being his character) but the action really is sweet, the protagonists are a blast to watch, especially when taking down goons, and the soundtrack, like the movie itself, really pumps you up.

That being said however will not stop me from being honest even though I purchased this BRD/DVD set. I will say overall I liked it better than Rise of Technovore. I know this is an anime movie, but it felt a little more Marvel-ish to me (for lack of a better term). The animation was great, what Ive come to expect from Madhouse, the story however was mid-range. Not great or epic in any way, but not horrible either. Ive seen worse (Ironman & Hulk Heroes United comes to mind). The best part I have to say however comes in the last 15 minutes. The Avengers finally make their cameo along with about a dozen or so random super-villains thrown in for good measure. Did it make sense? Absolutely not. Was it fun? Sure. I wouldnt mind seeing more Madhouse films or anime series in the future, as long as they get better and don't get worse. Also for anyone who may be sensitive to the PG-13 rating. I was pleasantly surprised. Youd think with Punisher as one of the main characters, the film would be gushing blood constantly, but much in the style of most western comics, it is kept to a minimum despite the gun-toting vigilante. Rise had far more depictions of graphic violence IMHO, so this was a welcome notch down, though it is still very much PG-13 for a reason. Its not bad as a rental or if you can find it on-line, but no need to purchase unless you are a completist like me.",1395964800,3,1482,4.353790613718411

Don't buy if anything wait until it's free on Amazon Prime.",1394841600,10,539,4.09433962264151
6242925,5,B00HXH00YE,"More edgy than other Marvel animation movies. So far DC Comics has owned the animated movies.

I enjoyed (1) how the Punisher was true to his comic book character, (2) more tough edgy violence than other Marvel works, (3) the fight sequences were delightfully done (4) the big name guest appearances were fun.

My dislikes are (1) the animations of the characters mouths when talking was like watching puppets, (2) the Black Widow romance was a little too corny for my tastes, and (3) I didn't care for the voice of Nick Fury.",1394755200,7,526,4.645161290322581
6242926,1,B00HXH00YE,"Raise your hand if you're TIRED of Marvel taking the easy (cheap) way out of producing movies.  Just the trailer alone was fair warning.  Compare that to the ""Son of Batman"" trailer.

Go back to the basics Marvel.",1394582400,9,213,4.552631578947368
6242927,5,B00HXH00YE,"I really liked this film as Marvel finally decided to put Punisher at the center. I also liked Black Widow though a little too melodramatic at one point. And, I the ensemble cast at the end was pretty entertaining. I recommend you give it a try.",1394582400,9,245,4.3478260869565215

8637172,3,B00HXH00YE,the animation is good but for some reason Japanese animation really is not good when it comes to depicting sadness or some emotions. They could take a page from Justice League animated or Disney movies. Marvel doesn't do a great job with animated movies compared to DC. Although marvel does a much better job with live action then DC. Marvel just needs to hire better staff for their animation studio.,1484611200,,401,4.742857142857143
