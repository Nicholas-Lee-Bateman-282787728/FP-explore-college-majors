3086223,4,B0012BDGV6,"This is another example of the fertile minds of the Korean film industry. It is based upon real political events over 20 years ago, yet for an anti-government (anti-war) film its anger gets wrapped up in an imaginative love story that lives beyond the lives it depicts. Almost coincidentally a romance begins with brief interludes of violence. Random lives, besides the protagonist who falls in love, are drawn to protest and pay the price for their idealism and sacrifice. The romance of the principal participants has more than a seductive appeal, representing all the idealistic goodness of the country (class, style, education, art) that gets repressed, obscured by the harsh political landscape (reality). With exquisite directorial control, not only the haunting winter beauty but the understated protest lingers long after you wonder if the romance played out as depicted. There are real flashbacks, to remind us of the political brutality, and wonderful fantasy sequences that allow hope to soothe our hearts when we know better. With considerable grace the director makes us aware of the velvet glove and the iron fist in the most subtle way I have seen on film, almost to say to us: you can live for today or live forever in our hearts all lovingly told.",1395532800,5,1264,5.023809523809524
3086224,5,B0012BDGV6,"""Hey, Yoon-hee, stop haunting me.""

Director Im Sang-soo imbues his take on the events leading up to the Gwangju tragedy with an elegant sadness and beauty. The uprising of citizens in South Korea against the government came to a violent head over a nine day period in May of 1980. It was, at that time, represented as a North Korean communist plot. Only afterward, was it recognized as a valiant and, for many, fatal effort to defend a democracy from military rule and corruption. Since 2002, May 18th has become a day of commemoration to restore honor to those who died for a free and democratic South Korea. Rather than simply make this a political film, however, Sang-woo centers it around a love story. Told in flashback, it encompasses those events and the lives it changed, and the futures it altered. As in many Korean dramas, snow is used to beautiful effect, helping create an intimacy to the story which is told with gentle restraint, rather than melodrama, making it all the more powerful.

Based on Hwang Sok-yong's novel, Ji Jin-Hee and Yeom Jeong-ah lend fine and heartfelt performances in this atmospheric and involving drama first released in 2006, but not widely seen until 2007. A gorgeous score by Kim Hong Hul is augmented by a haunting Korean ballad sung at the end. Sang-soo pulls his camera back on a snowy Seoul at night, haunted by love, as the song is sung. The feeling it creates stays with the viewer long after the credits come to a close. Not an angry film, despite the subject matter, it is instead like walking in on someone quietly sobbing in the darkness, the viewer an intruder made to understand the pain associated with the events by what they see. Portraits of Cho Duk-hyun and art from Song Jae Hee deserve mention, in a film about love during times of change, and sacrifices too great to calculate.

Prisoner number 1444 is being set free after nearly 17 years as the film opens. Hyan-woo has a touch of grey in his hair now, but is still relatively young. Returning home he has difficulty adjusting. Yoon-hee is the great love he left behind to fight, but she has died of cancer, leaving only letters. Caught and imprisoned before the real rebellion occurred, there is guilt and anguish at both the events that happened and regret that he was not there for his love. Ji Jin-Hee is terrific here, lending middle-age dignity to a man whose life passed him by while he was in prison. Sang-soo uses the letters as a device for flashbacks in which their love story, and what happened after Hyan-woo was gone, slowly unfold before the viewer just as they do for Hyan-woo. In the present, his old comrade Kun brings back memories as well. The anguish of body bags and slain comrades pale in comparison to the quieter tragedies which occurred while he and Kun were away, however.

There is a wonderful use of rain and snow in this film, often at night, which become a part of the mood Sang-soo creates in this beautiful drama. Agonizing decisions regarding when to leave become a way of life when Yoon-hee, a teacher, falls in love with Hyan-woo, sympathizing with his cause but angered it won't allow them a life together. She remains faithful while he is away, and leaves him more than one gift when he returns. One is a gift he will share, as Yoon-hee guides him towards peace in his soul. Yeom Jeong-ah's lovely performance is moving, and her contribution to the narrative's success cannot be overstated. A beautiful film of sadness and understanding, this Korean drama has much to offer film lovers. A film poetic and tender, Sang-hoo has restored honor to those who died through the telling of a flashback laden love story, at a time when happiness and beauty could not exist for some. Track a copy of this one down if you can. Lovely and affecting, this is another shining example of Korean cinema at its finest.",1278201600,15,3853,4.661764705882353
