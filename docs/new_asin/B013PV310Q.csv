7370435,4,B013PV310Q,"""Best of Enemies"" (2015 release; 88 min.) is a documentary about the infamous 10 televised debates that took place during the 1968 Republican and Democratic Presidential Conventions (in Miami and Chicago, respectively), between conservative William Buckley Jr. and liberal Gore Vidal. As the documentary opens, Vidal is commentating about old pictures hanging up in his house and one of them is showing Buckley and Vidal at one of those debates. We then get some background as to who these 2 guys are, and why ABC veered away to bring the ""unconventional Convention"" coverage. And then we get to the first debate... To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this documentary is co-directed by Morgan ""20 Feet From Stardom"" Neville and Robert Gordon, who is affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. If you think that means the documentary is kinder to Buckley that to Vidal, think again. The two men are pitted against each other, and vehemently disdain each other, even before these debates, and much more so afterwards. ""It was a confrontation of life styles"", as someone comments. Yes, it was, but as it turns out, these debates had another unexpected consequence: ABC's ratings went through the roof, and the other mainstream networks quickly realized they had to have their own versions of these ""point-counterpoint"" programs. In other words, the Buckley-Vidal debates set into motion what would eventually become the Fox's and MSNBC's news channels. Apart from the historical legacy created by these debates, the documentary also examines the long shadows cast be the debates over the personal lives of both Vidal and (even more so) Buckley. If you have any interest in politics and/or in TV history, you will not want to miss this documentary. It makes for completing viewing, period.

""Best of Enemies"" made quite a splash at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. The movie's been out for months and I didn't think it would reach theaters here in Cincinnati, but then out of the blue t showed up this weekend at my local art-house theater here. I figured this would not be playing very long and went to see it right away, The matinee screening where I saw this at turned into a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. A shame, as this is a riveting documentary. If you get the chance to see this, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not mist it! ""BEst of Enemies"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1445644800,18,2597,4.913439635535307
7370436,4,B013PV310Q,"It is truly a pleasure to watch two intelligent, articulate combatants engage in ten jousts broadcast by ABC during the 1968 presidential conventions.  William F. Buckley, Jr. was the publisher of the leading conservative journal of opinion in America, National Review.  His opponent, Gore Vidal, was an accomplished author and liberal commentator.  The combination of such intellectual heft with the drama of the times makes for compelling viewing.

Although the film attempts to be fairly balanced, it carries with it certain liberal assumptions.  For example, it is stated matter-of-factly that the call for ""law and order"" by politicians like Nixon, who was running for president for the second time in 1968, was merely a kind of code for racial prejudice.  This is something liberals have accused Republicans and conservatives of for years.  However, it ignores the very real fears people had of crime, civil unrest, and violent riots which were taking place during the late 1960s.  Second, the film implies that Vidal ""won"" the debates because Buckley lost his composure and called Vidal a ""queer"" on live national television.  However, as the film makes very clear, from the beginning Vidal had set out not to substantively debate issues with Buckley, but to provoke him with personal attacks including calling him a ""crypto-Nazi"" - certainly a less than polite term in its own right.

The main thesis of the film, that the Buckley-Vidal debates paved the way for the decline of civil disagreement and replaced it with the shouting matches we see so often today on cable TV is not completely without merit.  However, all one has to do is view old episodes of Buckley's PBS Firing Line program to see that his outburst with Vidal was out of character for him and should not in any way diminish WFB's astounding achievements as the founder of a major American political movement.",1442188800,8,1884,5.04516129032258
7370437,5,B013PV310Q,"Having been put off by what the directors/writers did to three recent films by changing the facts to make what I assume they thought would be  better moviesPhilomena, Selma and The Imitation Game, I was so happy to see this documentary, The Best of Enemies, a replay with commentary on the 1968 debates between two equal warriors of words: William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal.  ABC, lagging behind in ratings after NBC and CBSsomeone said in the documentary that the only reason ABC was not number 4 was because there were only three companies at the timegot the clever idea to schedule 8 debates between these two men during the now infamous Republican Presidential Convention in Miami followed soon after by the Democratic Convention in Chicago.

From the beginning, sparks flew and burst into flames in the eighth debate when Vidal called Buckley a crypto-Nazi and Buckley responded by calling Vidal a q---r, a first for live television. Dick Cavett, himself no slob when it comes to verbal gymnastics, reminds the movie-goer that the folks at ABC shat. Neither man ever completely recovered from losing their cool since their remarks haunted each of them the rest of their lives.

The debates are very well edited; the background musicincluding some J. S. Bachadds to the atmosphere and several talking heads-- if I can use that word-- make comments. Dick Cavett is joined by Christopher Hitchenswhom Vidal expected to throw his mantle to had it not been for Hitchens support of the Iraq WarVidals biographer Fred Kaplan, the former head of ABC, Buckley's brother-- who bears a strong resemblance to him-- and several others.

The subjects that Buckley and Vidal debate are eerily the same as what we talk about in 2015: that a few people have all the money (the disparity is much worse today than those Vidal quotes to Buckley here), the right to assemble peacefully, the far right versus the far left. And it is all too obvious that these debates were harbingers of what was to come on television. Unfortunately no onein my opinionhas risen to the level of these two fierce debatersregardless of which man you are rooting for or if you remain neutral. Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, just two of manyI think not.

An excellent movie.",1440806400,40,2234,4.86578947368421

7370442,2,B013PV310Q,"In 1968 ABC was in the doldrums in terms of its political coverage. Lacking sufficient resources to provide wall-to-wall coverage of the conventions of that year, the company had to look for other means to attract viewers.

It came up with the idea of staging nightly discussions of the proceedings involving Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley jr, two highly public figures who heartily disliked one another, while representing both extremes of the political spectrum. Vidal was a liberal, a lifelong advocate of free thinking who had scandalized the Establishment ever since the late Forties when his novel THE CITY AND THE PILLAR had appeared, with its open attitude towards homosexuality. Buckley was a right-winger, the forerunner of many public figures today; the founder and editor of the NATIONAL REVIEW, who, while not actively supporting continued racial segregation, nonetheless blamed members of the African American community for the country's economic woes.

The rest, as they say, is history. After a series of increasingly fractious nightly discussions, Vidal and Buckley finally came to blows, both literally as physically, during one live broadcast when Vidal denounced Buckley as a ""crypto-Nazi,"" and Buckley responded by calling Vidal a ""queer"" and threatening to smash his face in. Buckley soon realized what a televisual faux pas he had made, and spent the rest of his life trying to atone for it.

Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville's documentary could be approached as an exercise in nostalgia, an evocation of a time on television when pundits actually said what they thought rather than simply expressing anodyne views, and discussion-programs always had that element of danger about them. Other memorable moments like this included an episode of THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS (1963-4), when a member of the audience took exception to the views expressed by journalist Bernard Levin and tried to punch him in the face.

On the other hand, the documentary also underlined what happens to people when they come to believe in their own celebrity so much that they pay little or no heed to what they are saying. Vidal and Buckley were both highly intelligent men; but their exchanges seemed somehow pathetic, as they tried to score intellectual points off one another rather than engaging critically with the political issues of that time. They did not appear interested in communicating with viewers, but rather tried to enhance their screen images. If that was indeed the case, then both signally failed in their task; they came across as members of the chattering classes, to be ignored rather than listened to.",1472256000,2,2629,5.164319248826291
7370443,5,B013PV310Q,"Documentaries are like weddings. Many start off well, but go on way too long. The film maker gets a clip he likes, and it repeats twenty or thirty times, until the whole thing falls apart and you just wish it would stop. Examples abound, but Ross McElwee's ""Time Indefinite"" is a classic train wreck of this type. ""Best of Enemies"" is a refreshing exception. The editing stays right on target throughout, and the ending leaves us wishing for more, instead of sighing with relief.

I find both men interesting. Buckley seemed warm and sincere, even though his rigid Catholic conservatism was rather silly. Vidal wrote snarky, ridiculous essays but engaging historical fiction. From my distant observation, Vidal never had a happy moment. He is invariably condescending, sarcastic, bitter as lemon juice. When I see film of his house, high above the Italian coast, I cant imagine living in that heavenly home and being unhappy, but we all execute our program code, no matter the circumstances. Vidal's young assistant tells of him watching videotape of the 1968 debates over and over in his declining years.

So, to recall this debate, in spite of having seen it, was not easy to do because as profound as this documentary makes it out to be, there were so many other things going on at the time.  Two, is that very few people watched ABC.  Personally, I was a huge fan of Huntley and Brinkley with Walter a distant second.

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

Co-directed by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville, Best of Enemies chronicles the series of televised debates at the 1968 Republican and Democratic National Conventions, between conservative and liberal pundits, William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal.

Television convention coverage was usually a staid affair but Buckley and Vidal set the tone for years to come by going ""mano a mano"" perhaps the first time commentators of such different political persuasions presented such stark differences of opinion in a remarkably entertaining fashion. Indeed, ABC, considered the ""poor man's network"" at the time (in contrast to powerhouses CBS and NBC), garnered such favorable ratings, that we're informed by Gordon and Neville that television was ""never the same"" after the broadcast of these imbroglios.

Buckley, fairly well-known for his Firing Line show on PBS and Vidal, the noted author of various biographies of notable American politicians as well as other historical figures, both shared elite prep school backgrounds as well as being masters of the English language. One is struck however, by the true lack of substance as they grapple with the political issues of the day. Instead, each engage in a game of one-upmanship, trading cutting insults in order to humiliate one another.

The debate finally takes an ugly turn when Vidal manages to push Buckley's buttonscalling him a crypto-Nazi and praising the protesters who waved the Vietcong flag and cursed the police outside the Democratic National Convention. Buckley, usually proud of his self-control, suddenly loses it and calls Vidal a ""queer"" and threatens to punch him in the face. While Vidal argues that the protesters had a perfect right to ""free speech,"" Buckley regards their actions as the deepest betrayal to their country.

The documentarians supplement the footage of the actual debate with newsroom out takes along with commentary from supporters and detractors of the two men including Christopher Hitchens, Dick Cavett and James Wolcott.

Buckley is seen much later in life being interviewed, indicating that he was tired of life in general and ""ready to die."" While being interviewed by Ted Koppel, Buckley is stunned as he watches footage from the debates where he calls Vidal a ""queer."" After the footage is shown, he remarks to a friend that he thought that segment had been destroyed long ago. And Vidal appears equally obsessed with the debates, poring over them repeatedly at his Italian villa, much like an obsessed Norma Desmond watching her old silent pictures in ""Sunset Boulevard.""

While Best of Enemies proves to be vastly entertaining, it's also a cautionary tale about two extremely gifted men who forgot to embrace humor to soften the vitriol between them. In that respect, their ultimate clash on television, should be seen much more in the context of tragedy than mere entertainment or what some others may label as a comic interlude.",1455148800,2,2989,5.2125

7370478,3,B013PV310Q,"Both men were right.  As the 2015 documentary recounts, the ten 1968 televised debates of Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley reached a boiling point when the former called the latter a crypto-nazi and the latter responded by calling the former a queer.  Yes, the renowned author and political pundit Gore Vidal was gay.  And, yes, the execrable William F. Buckley, founder of the execrable NATIONAL REVIEW, was, according to the definition (""an evil person who wants to use power to control and harm other people especially because of their race, religion, etc."") by Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a nazi.  Perhaps ""crypto"" was the reason Buckley took offense and threatened to hit Vidal, because even a cursory examination of his public record shows there was nothing secretive about Buckley's detestable behavior such as opposing civil rights, supporting violent dictators Francisco Franco of Spain and Augusto Pinochet of Chile, advocating for relocation of ""chronic welfare cases to rehabilitation centers, and calling for A.I.D.S. victims to be required to reveal their condition via forearm tattoos.

So, which of these two commentators went on to a long run on television, at taxpayer-funded P.B.S., no less?  William F. Buckley.  As BEST OF ENEMIES tells it, Buckley regretted warning Vidal that he might take a swing at him, to the point that in the final broadcast of his television show he was speechless when asked about it.  Too bad no one brought up Buckley's humanitarian brainstorm for ending the A.I.D.S. crisis.

7370482,5,B013PV310Q,"William F. Buckley, the Conservative commentator and Gore Vidal, the Liberal writer and commentator bring the best and the worst of both sides in this documentary. I remember as a very young adult watching these debates in 1968 at the Republican Convention in Miami, and the Democratic Convention in Chicago. I sat rapt as these two men discussed their views, threw cryptic insults at one another and almost came to blows. A true harbinger of things to come and of our future.

In 1968, our world was seething with the Vietnam War and the rights of blacks and young people to assimilate. Buckley, was the brilliant conservative and some say the originator of the Conservative movement as it is known today. Vidal was the brilliant leftie, a homosexual, although he never admitted to that word. However, his writings and films all were a cross of the culture of his day. Both men disagreed with the other's point of view. Hate may be too strong a word, but that feeling is felt throughout the documentary.

The television news networks at the time were composed of NBC with Huntley and Brinkley, CBS with Walter Cronkite and ABC a faraway third, struggling to find its place. NBC and CBS had wall to wall coverage of the conventions. ABC was struggling to put in an hour's summary of the day. Someone had the bright idea to hire Buckley and Vidal to comment on the day's activities. Each would take their side and discuss their perspectives. ABC got more than their money's worth. Each night throat to throat discussions with insults and provocative words thrown about. ABC garnered higher ratings than any other network. Brilliant deductions.

Thus documentary gives us but a piece of this time, we see the most controversial of the discussions. But it is well worth your time to sit down and watch. When you finish the documentary, you will realize nothing has changed the insults and theories and philosophy of each side is exactly the same. This was a documentary par excellence. I urge everyone to view this and not come away with a sock to the side of the face.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-12-15",1449878400,5,2104,4.771978021978022
7370483,5,B013PV310Q,"""Best of Enemies"" is incredibly effective at achieving multiple thematic ends without coming off as dense. Here's a few of things it managed to touch on.

It's a sound, but passive, attack on the current state of our discourse, giving us a history lesson on the genesis moment of television punditry.

It's a fascinating look inside network news in the time of American political convention ""gavel- to-gavel"" coverage. The last time that ever happened.

It's an exploration of how TV changes us, or at the very least, reveals us to ourselves, both as people who long to sit in front of its cameras, and as a nation who watches its images.

It's about how the two sides of the late 60's culture war found their primetime voices.

It's about class, and how where we come, or how we where we wish we had come from, affects how and what we think.

It's about the personal journeys of the intellectuals at the center of it - gay-left leaning best selling counter-culture author Vidal and establishment defending policy-affecting conservative Buckley - and how their confrontation never really left the center stage of their own minds.

But most spectacularly, it's about how the issues of a turbulent period (our republic caught in an ongoing war of attrition, race riots in the streets, the all too familiar rhetoric of income and racial inequality at the center of the political debate) never really ended.

And it does all of those things with a sense of real legitimacy, never once feeling like it's assigning more importance to the story than it deserves. A perennial fault in the doc genre. But it's not just a good story. It's a good story told well.

The whole thing is brilliantly structured, wonderfully cut together, incredibly funny and tragic, and far-reaching in its ambition. It's political positioning is measured, either because of or in spite of it's co-director being affiliated with the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation.

It features great talking heads, including political historian Sam Tanenhaus (who I sorely miss as the New York Times Book Review editor) and avowed socialist/Marxist/anti-leftist/cultural contrarian Christopher Hitchens, who manages to bloviate even from beyond the grave.",1449792000,13,2226,5.073972602739726

I thoroughly enjoyed going back in time and reliving those moments long gone, but relished just the same. It was like opening a time capsule and reliving those moments of firsts in regard to live intellectual matches between the left and the right. The more things change the more they stay the same.

7370487,5,B013PV310Q,"I had the privilege of seeing this documentary at the True -False Film Festival in Columbia, MO last March when it debuted. Though I saw a number of fine documentary features, this one about two of America's favorite elitist snobs from opposite directions of the political spectrum debating their views during the political conventions in that tumultuous year of 1968 was the best. ABC News was in the cellar of the ratings that year and needed a boost in their coverage of the Republican and Democratic Conventions that year. They hired William Buckley of the National Review to represent the Conservative viewpoint and Liberal author Gore Vidal to face off on live television. What ABC News got was a huge ratings boost from these debates as they more or less insulted one another as much as each other's respective positions. What America got out of it has been just as long lasting. The end of civility in how we communicate with each other over our differing political opinions. While Vidal likely won the debates by keeping his cool as compared to Buckley losing his, it would be Buckley who would get some vindication in the end. His candidate, Ronald Reagan won the White House just twelve years later. Overall, ""Best of Enemies"" doesn't miss a beat as it balances itself as entertainment and education quite well. It is indeed a reminder that these two men absolutely hated one another, but also that nothing has really changed in nearly fifty years.",1449273600,4,1459,4.84
7370488,2,B013PV310Q,"Gore Vidal, is a writer who had enormous influence on me though his novels and his writings. Bill Buckley had little although I have heard second-hand much about him.

Still I have heard of these debates and was interested in hearing about them.

Well I did not like the presentation like it was sporting event. The labeling to me did not make sense as liberal and conservative. Although I cannot speak of Bill Buckley,  Gore Vidal is labeled a liberal, something I do not think fits would be a very extreme. An example here was it is shown Bill Buckley here is defending a liberal democratic president and mayor and Gore Vidal is criticizing them.

Possibly a better view would be that Gore was ideologically a sexual nutcase. His books were full of comments that today would be considered racial.

Also I confess while watching this documentary, I became very disappointed. I wanted to hear what these guys had to say, not what people around them thought who had won or lost. In any case it's hardly  a fair sample of people given to make such a call.",1449273600,4,1053,4.574468085106383
7370489,5,B013PV310Q,"A great recap of a pivotal moment in our cultural history. Gore Vidal is the poster boy of applied Frankfurt School Critical Theory and the practical application of Alinsky tactics. Buckley was clearly unprepared for attacks that leaped the bounds of fact-based rhetoric and Vidal got the best of him by ignoring shared reality and just creating his own. Vidal understood TV better than Buckley just as Kennedy had with Nixon. I am a huge Buckley fanboy, but Vidal is as close to Voldemort as you'll get in real life, and Buckley had a lightening bolt scar on his forehead after these debates.

It also really captures the inflection point of the Gramscian damage done by the likes of Vidal; the destruction of the moral structure of America one value at a time, and the reassignment of language. The term that Vidal used to get Buckley to lose his cool ""Crypto-Nazi"" was the conventional wisdom perpetrated by progressives (ne cultural Marxists) to paint Constitutional conservatives as ""Fascists"". Nazis are in fact the ""National Socialist German Workers Party"", National Socialists as opposed to Soviet ""International Socialists"", in the final analysis, all Marxists. The leap was so outrageous that Buckley short-circuited. I have not read Buckley's 12,000-word explanation in Esquire, but that is now on my list.

It's an excellent film, but I have to admit that watching how well Vidal executes makes me nauseous.",1449100800,2,1419,5.085836909871245

Newcomers to these two men need to know exactly what their thinking is; not this edited version.  I thought the documentary dwelt way too much on Vidal's homosexuality and book: Myra Breckenridge. (Buckley called said book 'pornographic'.) A newcomer might then dismiss Vidal as Buckley has done.  Vidal, from what I can gather from other sources. was extremely prophetic about the politics of our times.  I recommend that viewers research him to see how contemporary and far ahead of his time he was.  In his later years the media neglected him.  I caught him on CSpan  in the mid-nineties and was struck by his ability to see the truth underlying political corruption.  Yes, he is a progressive of sorts but Buckley is a reactionary conservative.  I would recommend other sources to learn about these two men and the events of 1968.",1448409600,6,943,4.801242236024844

I greatly enjoyed the historical context the film makers provide as well. I also found Reid (Bill's brother) Buckley's commentary on the feud surprisingly even-handed and neutral. It was indeed a different time when unscripted controversy rarely broke onto one of the big-three networks.

Even for one who was no stranger to the doc's narrative (having watched most of the full debates and read reviews of this film), the film was a delight.
