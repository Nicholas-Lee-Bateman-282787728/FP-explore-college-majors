8701175,5,B00TAZQLTU,"When I saw this available for rental, I was in the mood for a film in which very bad people were being eviscerated, much like the Liam Neeson, Matt Damon and, much earlier, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris series of cathartic productions. John Wick fit the bill perfectly- a former assassin for the Russian Mafia kingpin Viggo,  portrayed so consummately by Michael Nyqvist- I hope the spelling is right-, seeks a new life, with the approval of his former boss, only to have the loose cannon of a son of Viggo cross him viciously but unwittingly, the title character, as played by Keanu Reeves, is launched on a series of back and forths with an army of killers in Viggo's employ, including a couple of Viggo's former associates (one a red herring). But no more spoilers.
I will mention one most telling moment with a little quirky humor. At least two dozen of Viggo's top gorillas descend upon Wich's house in the wee small hours, only to be duly dispatched to their eternal reward. As Wick is picking up, a policeman rings the doorbell. Hence the following dialog:
Policeman: I saw your lights on John and was concerned.
Wick: Everything is fine, Jerry.
Cop looks in and sees dead bodies with ski masks.
P: Are you back in the business, John?
W: No, just sorting out some files.
P: Good night, John.
W: Good night, Jerry.
Highly recommended.",1449792000,2,1359,4.6625
