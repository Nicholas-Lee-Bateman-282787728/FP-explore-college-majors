5066219,5,B0079ILI2U,"Since some of these episodes are more than 10 years old (though they don't seem it) I found myself wondering what's happened to the sites since then.  Sadly the program was canceled in the UK after 20 years.  I love to see more episodes made available in the US, but for the time-being the Roman-Britain shows hit the spot.  Tony Robinson is a great ""everyman"" host, asking the questions that the viewer would.  Need more TIME TEAM!",1363737600,2,432,4.571428571428571

5066222,5,B0079ILI2U,"One of my favorite programs to come across the pond from the UK!  This program has been on TV in the UK for many years and is now, regrettably, in its final season.  Only a very small number of episodes have made it to DVD, and I've had to buy them from Amazon UK and view on my region-free DVD player.  This is the first set of episodes to be shown in the US and are now available on Amazon Instant Video; I hope more will follow.  In each episode, a team of British archaeologists excavate various sites from around the UK to see what they will find.  Each excavation is limited to three days, and it is always a challenge for the team to deal with the weather and various other complications which crop up.  Give it a go!",1358553600,,724,4.135714285714286
5066223,4,B0079ILI2U,"I caught the middle of one of these programs, but found out that all that glitters isn't roman coins.  The programs do improve over time, but they start out a bit dry.  I get the feeling that these are the equivalent of late night tv in England. I really wanted to love these, but, they present too little 'booty' for a lot of digging and interesting accents.  But late night watchable.",1355788800,,386,4.408450704225352
5066224,5,B0079ILI2U,"If you like archeology, you'll love it.  I had no idea that the Romans had settled so much of Britian.  There are ruins everywhere!  And almost as good was listening to the thick English accents.  My husband and I both watch a LOT of BBC programming, but we would not have made it without closed captioning.  We learned new English slang and became acquainted with Geophys.
  I order the book and several related books.
  I went to the website and tried to watch episodes online, but kept getting the message that I might be in the wrong country for that.
  I just hope they will release more episodes.
  I loved Tony Robinson and Phil Hartman (I think that's his name).  They were always enthusiastic.  There is a lot of humor.",1346889600,,728,4.492307692307692
5066225,5,B0079ILI2U,"For those who have an interest in Roman Archaeology, this set is a very good introduction
to Time Team's Roman era digs. However, if you already have the Australian released (region free) Time Team seasons 14 to 18 on DVD, plus the UK Released 'Time Team Best Digs' DVD, then you already have 8 out of 12 of the episodes featured on this DVD set. The four episodes which are previously unreleased on DVD anywhere are:
- Episode 1 Tockenham 1995
- Episode 2 Birdoswald 2000
- Episode 3 Greenwich 1999
- Episode 5 Alfodean 2006
If you want a good assemblage of episodes relating to the Roman Occupation of Britain from the 1st to 5th centuries AD, (rather then the Roman Invasion of 43 AD specifically, which the title suggests) Then this is a fantastic set.",1346544000,,756,4.525547445255475

5066227,5,B0079ILI2U,"time team is a show that has been on Uk televsion since january 1994! They have made 258 episodes in 19 seasons. That is a incredible job for a show about a group of archeologists who have three days to excavate a site!. Tonny Robinson; a actor and  writer most familiar from the black adder tv show is the featured host and he helps out in each episode. This dvd takes a number of shows that had excavations featuring Roman ruins and sites and puts them in a compilation form. The first episode is from the very first season. the rest are from later on. I loved time team on television ,when we were lucky enough to get the show on History 2 via satellite or cable. But it's no longer on! Which seems foolish as you have so many episodes to show by now! The team has only 3 days to accomplish their goals even. Which means they have to move fast and find what they can, the team has alot of fun and you get to discover what they do in each episode. Hopefully more time team dvd's will come out because they go all over finding lots of places and things to dig up, including one episode where they dug up several crashed B-17 bombers in a field. (that episode is  NOt on this set) but you get the point. Each episode is about discovery and there's alot of things to dig up in the UK!.  the first episode is not widescreen because it's from 1994 , but the rest are as they are from later seasons. If you want to know what's in each episode in this set read the other 5 star review, he did a great job.",1343606400,4,1500,4.112627986348123
5066228,5,B0079ILI2U,"Scientific yet enjoyable for laymen. Expert teams kept moving, the show hopping & fun with Tony Robinson (actor, comedian, history buff) pointing the way. Digging in dirt has seldom been so much fun. Massive use of geophysics, then back hoes, on to trowel & brush digs. It opens up what 2000 yr-old Romano-British archeology began as. And fantastic artist renderings help the uneducated-but-interested visualize what the experts see in stones, shards, and coins. The bonus material offers 7 text bios of experts filmed in 12 excavations. More bonus in a viewer's guide. A documentary with the look of prime-time TV.

5066271,4,B0079ILI2U,At times a bit hokey but can be very informational at the same time.  I think the concept of only three days to complete a dig actually does more damage and injustice to what could and should be learned for the sites.,1473206400,,217,4.166666666666667

5066274,5,B0079ILI2U,"Not sure why I enjoy this show so much.  They can't really do an in depth study of the sites in only 3 days and sometimes their assumptions seem a bit dubious, but it works.

5066320,5,B0079ILI2U,"I saw a few episodes of Time Team on PBS in Los Angeles years ago, and only just recently ran across it again through Netflix and Acorn TV (on Roku).  A bunch of wonderful (and self-described) old hippie archaeologists traipsing around Great Britain discovering lost bits of history from the Roman occupation 2000 years ago (100 BC to 3-400 AD), and sometimes earlier.  I have learned so much about this period I knew relatively little about.  A fascinating look at how field work is done, and how much fun it can be.  Well produced, great 'family' fare, (and NO commercials) and if you like learning about ancient history--this may just interest you.  I understand this series was on for 20 years in England but I have yet to be able to find more than 30 or so episodes on Acorn TV, and I've watched them more than once.  I understand there are more than 200 episodes around somewhere, and would love to see them all--anybody know where they are available in the US?  This is probably thebest 'reality TV' you will ever see in my humble opinion (altho I don't like ANY other reality TV at all).",1405728000,,1095,4.527918781725888

5066323,5,B0079ILI2U,"I used to faithfully watch this show. Then I got rid of my television. Was thinking about the show and there it was on Amazon Prime Video for me to watch on my computer. The best part is Amazon Prime Video offers select shows where the team actually made some fascinating discoveries; sometimes they didn't although it was still fun to watch. If you're not familiar with the program, a team of archaeologists, experts and historians go to different locations throughout the UK where there may be unexplored archaeological finds. The host is a non-expert who translates the observations and discussions of the experts into layman's terms and his enthusiasm, along with the excitement of the experts when they do find something (a piece of pottery, a Roman coin, etc.) is contagious. It's ending this year (2013) after 15 seasons.",1375228800,,828,4.921428571428572

I've been watching the few sets available from the UK (PAL), but had to get this set when it came out in US NTSC standard.  Most of these are great digs, though not all.  You can see the team change over the years, some are better than others.  The biggest let-down is when Carenza Lewis leaves.

8512790,5,B0079ILI2U,"We're now half-way into Season 2 of Time Team and enjoying it very much. We got very sick of murder mysteries, thrillers and other shows showing nasty and miserable people doing nasty and miserable things. Here we have a skilled and energetic team all working together to discover the historical truth. Even when they disagree, they have the same ultimate goal. Even when it rains, they manage to dredge up a bit of good cheer. Each fast-paced episode covers a three-day dig at one site, most episodes following a logical pattern: a brief explanation of why they're digging at this location, the questions they hope to answer, a geo-physical survey that maps magnetic anomalies under the surface and helps them locate the most useful places to dig, and then the digging of several trenches, each for a reason. The goal is not to uncover ""treasures,"" though they enjoy those when they appear. A treasure ripped out of its context is meaningless, and they are happiest when they discover something surprising alongside pottery or other finds that provide a date or socio-economic context. The show uses several techniques to make it easy to see what the archaeologists are seeing. They often highlight a feature in the ground to help the viewer's eye pick it out, and they use computer graphics to illustrate what the building might have looked like originally. Each episode also ""re-enacts"" one element related to the period of the site. Among those we've seen are foraging for a wild meal, molding a pewter bowl, hammering out a brass bucket, carving an altar, even spending a lonely day as a slave. It's a lively show, and you gradually learn quite a bit about archaeological methodology (including what NOT to do as an amateur), the social history of ancient Britain, and the changes in the artifacts themselves. I look forward to a couple of episodes each evening (I can easily imagine binge-watching this). I highly recommend them. And as a sidelight, we enjoy archaeologist Phil Harding's Wiltshire accent, which sounds just like Hagrid in Harry Potter.",1477612800,,2058,4.9508670520231215
