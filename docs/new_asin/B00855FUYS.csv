8525218,1,B00855FUYS,"Regret having purchased this DVD

Totally out of date and very much in the 90's themes.

Dancing the way they show you will get you thrown out of the club for taking too much space.",1378857600,5,181,4.142857142857143
8525219,5,B00855FUYS,"This is not the only DVD set that I ordered for club dancing but it is definitely the best one. Most of all, the moves shown here look ""up to date"" and you won't make a fool of yourself by actually using them in the club. The difficulty level is OK and everything is broken down into easy to follow steps. However, just repeating the moves is one thing, making them look really good takes a bit more practice. As mentioned on the DVD, you are taught individual moves and not whole choreographies. I really like this because in my opinion this is just what is needed for dancing in the club.
One negative issue is the producer's support. It is really, really bad. I once got a reply but then never again (in more than a month) - even after re-sending my inquiry.",1362182400,7,761,4.291666666666667
8525220,5,B00855FUYS,"I've never been a dancer because of my fear of looking like a nerd. After watching this DVD and seeing some of the instructional steps, I'm hoping to at the least be able to get on the dance floor with some basic decent moves.",1356566400,,226,4.159090909090909
8525221,5,B00855FUYS,Very easy to follow and understand.  Definitely gave me a confidence boost when I'm out with friends at the bar or for all those weddings.  Highly recommend if you like to dance but lack the good moves and confidence to pull them off.,1342483200,5,234,4.4186046511627906
