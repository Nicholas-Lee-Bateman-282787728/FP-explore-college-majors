8220113,5,B000VUQ4FE,"This is an incredibly safe and effective first trimester workout.  I haven't tried the others yet as I am in first trimester.  Lindsay knows what safety modifications are important to make for a pregnant woman's body, but she still works you out properly.

Some people have complained about some of the exercises feeling awkward, especially the curtsies, and they will only if you are using poor form.  Ideally you should start this video before you become pregnant (as it is also intended for pre-pregnancy) to master the forms correctly but of course it doesn't always work out that way.  In that case you should spend some time practicing lunges using the correct form (put the weight through the heel of the front/supporting leg).  I used to have issues with lunges due to bad knees until I figured out the proper form.  Now I have absolutely no knee pain and my knees are actually stronger than they used to be.  Once basic lunges are mastered the curtsies are very easy, and since you're going back at an angle you have more balance with a wider stance.

One of the things I'm most pleased about with this video are the core exercises.  Lindsay is very careful not to overwork your core muscles and uses exercises that are appropriate for a pregnant woman.  I say this after comparing them to the ab exercises in the Summer Sanders workout which are flat out unsafe (but the rest of the exercises are good).

You can't really go wrong with this workout as long as you pay attention to proper form and listen to your body. Also, the yoga segment is great, stretches out all the muscles that need it and really help you to feel better.  The yoga is a bit harder to finish if you are suffering from morning sickness, but that goes for any floorwork or exercises where your head isn't looking straight forward (if you're like me).",1345075200,2,1832,4.6
8220114,5,B000VUQ4FE,"This is my first pregnancy and I had so many questions on what workouts to do and not to do.  I was hesitate to buy the set of three, but I am very pleased that I did.  I am only on the first trimester DVD but I love it.  It was challenging and informative.  Linsey's positive attitude and helpful information is great. I love being pregnant and working out at home.  Looking forward to moving on to the next DVD.",1300752000,,413,4.1125
8220115,5,B000VUQ4FE,"I purchased four exercise DVDs to do during my pregnancy, and this is one of my favorites. My other favorite is Autumn Calabrese's 9 Months of Fitness. Both of these are really great workouts and offer a mix of strength and cardio. This one has a bonus yoga workout with great exercises for stretching as well. The workout is challenging, but does not feel overwhelming. I only have one complaint about this video, and that is the instructor insists on referring to your glutes as ""buncakes"". This is so annoying and cheesy. Other than that, it's a great workout, and I highly recommend it.",1286755200,3,590,4.6826923076923075
8220116,4,B000VUQ4FE,"This DVD does a nice job with the toning segments and the yoga portion, but the cardio segments don't seem quite rigorous enough.  I know that you shouldn't push yourself too hard in pregnancy, so I wouldn't expect to be covered in sweat and breathing heavy, but it still seems to fall a bit short of being a good cardio workout.  That being said, I still do the DVD about twice a week and do other workouts on the other days that are slightly more cardio heavy, so I think it's still a good DVD to have.",1284076800,,504,4.185567010309279
8220117,3,B000VUQ4FE,"This is a pretty good and challenging video. She uses weights (2 sets) and demonstrates a variety of strength training exercises, with 2 back-up pregos using lighter weights for demonstration. Though they are good moves, the video doesn't always cut to a correlating shot of ""how to do it"" immediately. Sort of odd, and so 1/2 way through your reps you realize you've been doing it wrong--not every move though.

Also, there are brief intervals of cardio thrown in which I found to be somewhat lackluster. A lot of marching in place and grapevine type moves.

My last complaint (which could totally just be my own reaction, or my prego state of mind) but I find Lindsay Brin a little annoying. She is ultra perky and keeps talking about your ""bun"" which I found annoying. In order to buy a workout DVD and do it repeatedly, you really have to like the person teaching it, and unfortunately this instructor grated my nerves.",1281052800,15,923,4.691358024691358
8220118,5,B000VUQ4FE,I absolutely love how these are tailored to the trimester you are in during pregnancy! Such great workouts and really helped in keeping me healthy and in the proper shape without overdoing anything! Love them!,1272585600,,209,5.0
8220119,5,B000VUQ4FE,"Lindsay's prenatal workout DVDS are fantastic! I have all three prenatal workout DVDs and love all of them. I used it with my first and now my second pregnancy and it helps keep the weight gain in check. It's great having a good workout video at home for when you are too tired to make it to the gym, especially in your first trimester. I use it 2-3 times a week, and do just cardio on the other days. I love that there is a yoga section. It really helps to stay relaxed and keep your body loose and limber during pregnancy. I am so glad that I will have these to use throughout the rest of my child-bearing years!  The only thing about it that gets hard for me is doing the same cardio choreography over and over for 3 months at a time. This comes from doing advanced step-aerobics 3 times a week at the gym and having a different routine to learn every time, which I loved. But I would just make up my own cardio segments when I was tired of doing the ones provided--an easy solution to that problem. Even with that I rate this DVD 5 stars because it delivers what it should: keeping you in great shape while keeping you and your baby safe. Lindsay is energetic and positive and keeps you motivated to give it your best! her workouts leave you feeling energetic, not exhausted.",1272412800,,1279,4.2633744855967075
8220120,5,B000VUQ4FE,"OK, I recommend all 3 trimester workouts. I was able to get a workout that got my heart pumping, but it was never too much, these DVDs are really well done to give you a safe prenatal workout. I'm 4.5 months postpartum now, and am back to my pre-pregnancy weight! I know that doing the prenatal workouts kept me from gaining too much weight, and made it easier to get back into working out regularly (with her Boot Camp!) since I didn't take a 9 month workout break. I felt energetic, not exhausted, after these workouts. Good to see real pregnant women on these videos, too.",1270252800,2,575,4.433962264150943
8220121,5,B000VUQ4FE,"I exercised with Lindsay Brin's Prenatal DVDs throughout my recent pregnancy.  I highly recommend any of Lindsay's videos, as her workouts helped me to have more energy and feel better than any of my other pregnancies.  Because her program is targeted to specific trimester needs, I always found the program to be exactly what I needed.  The first trimester program is challenging, while keeping the exercises appropriate for mom and baby.  (I found many other prenatal videos to  be too easy this early along.)  Lindsey's positive, upbeat demeanor makes it easy to keep on track.  I tried many other prenatal programs; but, Lindsey's is the only one I kept coming back to; the only one I looked forward to doing in the mornings.  My baby is now 2 1/2 weeks old, and as soon as my doctor OK's working out again I plan on using Lindsay's Boot Camp 2 workout to regain my pre-pregnancy figure.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Brin-s-Boot-Camp-2-with-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B000VUQ4G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp 2 with Moms Into Fitness</a>",1270080000,2,1111,5.650602409638554
