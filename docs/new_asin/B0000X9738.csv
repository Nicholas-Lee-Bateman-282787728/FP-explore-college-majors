1958667,4,B0000X9738,My husband grew up next to the Railroad and he enjoys anything that has to do with trains.  We both enjoyed the movie.,1375488000,,118,4.130434782608695
1958668,5,B0000X9738,My grandson loves this movie. I purchased the movie for a very good price. The movie was used but in like new condition. A good buy!,1326844800,,132,4.115384615384615
1958669,3,B0000X9738,"As mentioned in the negative reviews, the writing is only so-so and the acting is terrible (the child actors are better than the adults), but don't write this film off.  It's good family fun.  My six year old nephew loves it.  He watched three times within 24 hours of receiving it.  He laughed at every joke and was on the edge of his seat for the last half of the movie.  What this movie lacks in talent, it makes up for in heart.",1170028800,4,432,4.156626506024097
1958670,3,B0000X9738,"Terrible acting (almost amusingly so) but a decent, though not very original, story.  But hey, the kids (ages 3 & 6) like it, which is really the whole point.",1097798400,,158,4.448275862068965
1958671,1,B0000X9738,"This is a terrible, terrible movie.  Every joke falls short, and my 15, 12, and 9 year old sisters all eventually had to abandon the movie, all declaring it ""the dumbest movie ever.""  Sure, there's nothing offensive in it, but there's also nothing entertaining.  Steer clear of this film's bad acting, writing, and utter lack of value.  There are plenty of good family movies out there.  This formulaic groaner is not one of them.",1093651200,,430,4.756756756756757

8004297,5,B0000X9738,"This movie is of course an amateur work, but I think it's absolutely great for it's innocence which really stands out. There are technical errors in it, but I over look them for the entertainment value. I have seen far worse out of major studios. Some people are very critical about it, but all I can say is that those people are cold and have no heart. I liked it and will watch it again. Maybe it's my second childhood, but I also like steam locomotives, and anyone that saves one from a scrap heap is a hero to me. Well worth watching, especially if you have children. ------------ Dave.",1487894400,,590,4.372727272727273

8004300,1,B0000X9738,"A truly horrible movie. Groaner is the right description. It was like a bad play. People have never acted before. Producers have never produced, cameras have never cameraed before. We watched the whole thing though, and had to laugh.",1474329600,,233,5.0
