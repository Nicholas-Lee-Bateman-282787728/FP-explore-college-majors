8328479,5,B001NZ2AXQ,"Sergei Eisenstein, who is generally regarded as one of the most important innovators in global cinema history, directed this must-see account of the October Revolution in 1917 Russia. If you have any historical interest in the Russian Revolution, you have to see this film. Whether or not it is completely historically accurate is beside the point. Eisenstein created a masterpiece illustrating the ecstatic emotion that accompanied the overthrow of the Czarist tyranny of the Romanov dynasty.",1252713600,,493,5.5
