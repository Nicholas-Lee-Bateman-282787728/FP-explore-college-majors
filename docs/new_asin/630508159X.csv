973508,5,630508159X,"This movie is actually a filmed version of a play and this is obvious in the viewing; the director doesn't make use of all the potential of the medium, it's filmed all in one take (just as a play goes from start to  finish in one go), and the scene transitions are abrupt and poor.  That  being said, this film deserves no other criticism; it is certainly the  finest I've ever seen and, I would argue, a great movie in the English  cinema.  What makes it deserve such praise is that the acting is all very  convincing and compelling, the costumes and staging are sublime and the  script is, simply put, brilliant.  The original title of the work fuctions  as an apt summary: ""The assasination and persecution of Jean-Paul  Marat as performed by the inmates of the asylum at Charenton under the  direction of the Marquis de Sade.""  Set in the Napoleonic era eighteen  years after the French Revolution, the Marquis (imprisoned for both  political and sex crimes) directs the mentally ill inmates in a stylized  recreation of the murder of Jean-Paul Marat (a rabid Jacobin, confined to  his bathtub by a skin disease, who wrote the most sanguinary Revolutionary  propaganda) by Charlotte Corday (from a noble background, but actually a  partisan of the Girondin Revolutionaries who had been purged by Marat's  party).  This is a highly cerebral play and, although the scrip (a  translation of Peter Wiess' play) takes a very few liberties with the  historical facts, a knowledge of the Revolution greatly helps in  understanding and appreciating this sometimes obscure movie.  There are  real intellectual pyrotechnics in the debates between Marat and de Sade,  and the Marat's monologues are filled with fine revolutionary polemics.  Corday is very well played, and her scenes are some of the most emotionally  intense.  The brilliant script, which doesn't shrink from tackiling great  Ideas, combined with the great execution make this a superb movie.  Or  rather film.",958780800,32,1970,4.981481481481482

973655,5,630508159X,"I saw this film version of the Royal Shakespeare Production of Marat/Sade in a brief theatrical release years ago while I was in college, and was profoundly moved by it then.  Several years ago I was delighted to find and purchase the DVD, and upon viewing it found it had lost none of it's punch, it's relevance or it's brilliance! It is visually striking, the writing is a feast for the ear and the mind, and it 'works' brilliantly on not only the level of watching a play, but drawing the viewer into the play, observing the immates from just beyond the bars. At the end when de Sade laughs at the chaos in the madhouse, it is our polite sensibilities he laughts at!
A year or so ago I had the great fortune of seeing a production of this play at the University of Texas, which again was wonderfully realized.  I cannot understand why this DVD is no longer available from the manufacturer:  I suppose that on the surface it seems of limited appeal - but the theme of the philosohical debate between de Sade and Marat is as important and relevant today as it was forty years ago, and it is presented so brilliantly through the writing, the staging and the acting in this one of a kind DVD.",1243123200,3,1191,4.380090497737557
973656,5,630508159X,"Based on a Peter Weiss' play and staged by inmates of a French insane asylum, Peter Brook directed a brutal, fascinating, demolishing and ruthless radiography that reveals clever reflections, powerful statements under a claustrophobic ambiance.

The level of struggling tension really reaches unbearable limits. There's a crude dissection about the insights of the power, unmasking the perversity behind the term revolution. Marat and Marquis of Sade confront themselves exposing everyone of them one under the optic of the most fevered idealism and the other with the power of a desperate anguish, supported by a penetrating knowledge about the vast extensions of the human soul. On the other hand, we notice how the nave beliefs of Carlota Corday will be turning until her final decision.

The accurate camera angles, the hopeless people, crowd's unhelpful screams in the void, the latent paranoia of that asylum as a sharp metaphor of our surrounding world has never portrayed with such magisterial perfection.

This film meant the debut of Glenda Jackson as Carlota Corday and definitively was the most powerful inspiration seed for a very talented director who would emerge very soon: Ken Russell.

Extraordinary, incisive and delirious. A true masterwork all the way through.",1233360000,,1281,5.39
973657,5,630508159X,"You ever watch a movie that just sends chills up and down your body from beginning to end?  You ever watch a movie that cements itself in your subconscious and pulverizes you with its magnetism over and over, until you just cannot take it any more?  You ever watch a movie that is so rich and so disturbingly authentic that you feel compelled to laud it above all others?

This is that movie.

From the opening credits until the closing ones, `Marat/Sade' is one of the most engaging and utterly phenomenal pieces of art I have ever witnessed.  It is mind shattering in its delivery, coupling some of the most intriguing and utterly brilliant performances with one of the most compelling concepts ever put to film.  This is a masterclass film, one that gets everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) right.

The film tells of the Marquis de Sade, a man imprisoned at Charenton Asylum in 1808.  He writes and directs a play starring his fellow inmates, a play that tells of the French Revolution, and he puts it on for the asylum director Coulmier and his family.  The film, taking place within the small confines of a prison cell and never leaving that one particular room, is so visually expansive that it is beyond me how director Peter Brook was able to accomplish this.  The film feels so much bigger than it is.  It's hard to really explain well how this movie works, but just know that despite the fact that it never leaves the one room it takes you to places much further than the confines of a cell would suggest.

The film is based on the stage play by Peter Weiss and is shot much like a theatrical production, but it never feels stiff as some `stage to screen' films can feel.  This film moves with such fluidity, it's insanely impressive.

Brook's decision to focus quite frequently on facial expressions of the cast was a brilliant way of making the film feel much more intimate than a mere stage production.  What is so important about this decision was that it allows the audience to see the insanity that lurks behind the inmates eyes, because the real story being told is not that of the play being put on but that of the character development of these lost souls, each of them playing their part in this intense and very controversial production.  These inmates become these characters and they absorb their weaknesses and their strengths and they embellish them with reckless abandon.  Watching their own humanity fester behind their sockets is chilling to say the least.

There are two performers here that are beyond mesmerizing and that truly deserve all our recognition; and they are Glenda Jackson and Patrick Magee.  Patrick Magee delivers such a powerful and moving performance as the Marquis de Sade, his control so consistent and absorbing.  He takes a much different approach to the character than the one presented by Geoffrey Rush in `Quills', both spectacular but Magee is leagues better.  There are scenes where the camera is focused on his face and he is delivering a lengthy monologue that just sinks right into our flesh and becomes a part of us.  He is matched every step of the way by Glenda Jackson, who embodies Charlotte Corday from head to toe.  Just watch the way she connects to the dagger as if it were her long lost friend.  The scene is so symbolic of the actual revolt that is dominating the minds of the inmates as the carry on this play.

And then there is that hair-whipping scene between Sade and Corday that just blew my mind.

This is not a film for everyone, for the concept and delivery is far from commercial, and so if you are not a fan of the `arthouse' type films then this is one you may not want to entertain yourself with; but if you do enjoy a film rich with substance, some of which you may have to really uncover personally, then this is a film for you and one I urge you to find and watch.  The performances, the direction, the script and lighting; the editing and costumes and makeup and just everything are utter perfection.  There is not one sour note here, honestly.",1228176000,,4030,4.582984658298466
973658,5,630508159X,"An excellent movie, which is no more or less than stunning, stark and bleak filmed version of Peter Weiss' haunting, diturbing and magnificent play. It is very well cast, with the same actors who first perfromed the play in London under Peter Brook's direction.
Great perfomances all round by some very great actors, some of whom are well known, some of whom are not.
Among the well known names: Glenda Jackson MP, who is a memorabla Corday, although one bitten by a Tse-Tse fly, the late Ian Richardson, yes the snide and sneaky Francis Urquhart, who is a brooding and glowering Marat, he even looks like the real Jean-Paul Marat and Richardson is spot on as Marat, who was a raving idealist, his body and mind hollowed out by illness and paranoia, excactly as depicted in the play.

Among the not so well-known: Freddie Jones, good as ever, as one of the four man musical troupe, and Patrick Magee as the marquis de Sade.
Patrick Magee should of course not be confused with the debonnaire, brolly-wielding John Steed, Patrick MacNee, who later often co-starred in the vomitingly godawful  ""Murder She ****ing Wrote"", no that 's a different bloke altogether. Magee was also in ""Clockwork Organge"" and in lots of other proper artie movies, not al that camp telly crap which John Steed was in.

My only trouble with this is: why can't we get this on DVD in Europe?

Peter Brook, who is one of the world's most renowned theater directors, has made an excellent adaptation of The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade (the gloriously long official title).  I saw this film in college, and love the intensity of the whole thing.  Now that I am older and have read de Sade and a touch of Marat (which I didn't read in college, imagine that), things actually make more sense now, and the film/play resonates more deeply.  Patrick Magee and Ian Richardson are phenomenal in this film, and Brook's direction manages somehow to incorporate the best of the film aesthetic and theater aesthetic.  It is an amazingly intense experience, one that will sear itself in your memory.

973660,5,630508159X,"Marat / Sade is an incredible theatrical production that was captured well in this film.  Complaints that has been made  about the sound quality of the DVD though is well founded but unfortunately this was a problem with the movie when it first appeared in theatres.

  The movie takes place on a stage behind bars in asylum of Charenton. Behind the bars as well sit confident arrogant and ignorant  asylum's director and his family. Performed is a play written and directed by the Marquis de Sade (Patrick Magee).

  In point of fact  plays written by de Sade and performed by the inmates of Charenton actually took place. But Peter Brooks takes things to another level as he through the character of Sade poses many questions to the viewer while at the same time shocking the sense. Cleverly the actors are given parts that have something in common with their mental disorder.

This is a musical but probably like no other musical you have ever seen. It is somewhat like some of the Mystery plays of the Middle Ages. There are plays with in plays, clever references made and word play, as like are found in the Mystery plays, to and regarding the actors themselves and the surroundings where they are performing.

The play is about the death of Marat but it is within it is a larger play about the French Revolution. But the play is more than a history lesson. All through it the character playing Marat sits in a bathtub as Sade taunts him. Much of his taunts take the form of long philosophical soliloquies belittling Marat, the Revolution and society in general. Through out the play the inmates fall in and out of character to the symptoms of their various mental illnesses.

  The songs are incredibly well  integrated into the play and are quite witty and enjoyable -some of them almost joyous.

  Comically the director of the asylum, a condescending buffoon, interrupts the play time and again when statements are made that go against the current ideology.

  As the play about a revolution concludes a real  revolution starts behind the bars and the film ends in chaos.

The final scene is a pan back  showing the audience at the bars in which the stage is enclosed. Are they clamoring to get in? Do they too want to be inmates? Do they want to become part of the free for all?

973763,5,630508159X,"Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade as performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company under the direction of Peter Brook. (1966)

The cast and a history thereof:

The Marquis de Sade, as performed by Patrick Magee.

  What needs to be known of de Sade involves, primarily, his second stay at the asylum at Charenton, although, it an idea of his philosophy should be displayed here. de Sade was a hedonist who had been to the Bastille and Charenton before, namely, for abuse towards prostitutes and various others of either gender. He was viewed as a dangerous sexual deviant and spent a good portion of his life imprisoned, until the start of the French Revolution of which, he supported (possibly to prevent his own death.) He was a nihilist, but also supported a certain Utopian socialism, and had effectively became one of the earliest existentialists, though he is rarely regarded with such a title.

At the start of the nineteenth century, Napoleon Bonaparte had him, again, imprisoned, residing in Charenton under the asylum's director

Abbe de Coulmier, as performed by Clifford Rose.

  Monsieur Coulmier was very liberal in dealing with the treatment of patients, allowing de Sade to set up a series of plays that were available for public viewing, within the fictional content of Marat/Sade the play in question is The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade. The play takes a novel approach to theater, allowing de Sade to interact and converse directly with the fifteen years deceased

Jean-Paul Marat, as performed by Ian Richardson.

  Marat is, of course, the focus of this play and his role in the French Revolution and the subsequent Reign of Terror are vital facts. Marat was a member of the Jacobin Club, a group of radical republican thinkers, directly responsible for these events, with the help of Girondists, less a political party and more of a group of like-minded thinkers.

  His body racked with a fever he threw himself into writing for the revolution, creating policy on dealing with enemies, declaring traitors and spurring the masses on in their bloodbath in the name of freedom. Much of Marat/Sade deals with the questions of de Sade concerning whether or not this bloodshed was worth it, or the right way to go about it. Many considered Marat a hero, though there were more than a few who considered him a butcher.

  Following the Revolution, Jacobin's spurred on the Terror, claiming that the enemies of France were not eliminated and were, in fact, in hiding. In summary (or rather, not quite in his exact words,) Marat claims that they wear the cap of the people, but their underwear is embroidered with crowns and that the lot of them are the first to scream beggar, thief, or guttersnipe when a shop or two is looted. This is what leads him to the idea that the new aristocracy is any who owns more than any other. He points out that one will keep a horse, another his house in the country and another his army. This, he claims, is contrary to liberty and freedom. These, he goes on, are the new enemies of France and the bloodshed continued, numbering anywhere from eighteen thousand to forty thousand dead.

  His writing would go on until he was visited three times by the assassin

Charlotte Corday, as performed by Glenda Jackson.

  Who had decided to assassinate him due to the mass atrocities he and his faction had caused, though, the final decision would lie with the arrest of twenty-two Girondists and, later, the denouncing of their leader Jacques Pierre Brissot. She was successful in her endeavor, as might be anticipated by the full title of Marat/Sade.

Major themes throughout:

  From the beginning, it becomes clear that this is no standard play, being a work of metafiction and delving into a play within a play. Through this medium, it allows Peter Weiss make light of the standard structure of theater and display a level of creativity, in the case of the film, that often goes unseen.

  Additionally the (approximately) true history behind this work is intriguing, bring to the foreground a brutality that is generally ignored in French culture. Furthermore, French society becomes reflected within the asylum at Charenton, the down-trodden going through a similar metamorphosis as the upheaval of their very society not two decades earlier.

  The real treat, the audience will find, is the rhetoric between de Sade and Marat throughout the play, each attacking the philosophy of the other, presenting questions each other and the audience. This inevitably leaves the audience to decide.

  Marat/Sade is a rhapsody that should be made more available to a larger audience, creating within them worthwhile question and providing an interesting history at the same time: allowing the audience to see the brutal legacy of France, drowning the preconceived stereotypes of the country (at least within the United States.)",1109548800,12,4973,4.958937198067633
973764,4,630508159X,"The only problem that I have with this production is that, for some inexplicable reason, they do the scene of ""Marat's Nightmare"" in pantomime, completely wasting one of the great portions of the play. The audio recording of this production, which used to be available on Caedmon, includes the scene with the dialogue intact. I would have given the movie version 5 stars but for this disappointing omission. Otherwise, it's an all time classic.",1098230400,8,444,5.013513513513513
973765,3,630508159X,"In 1808, at a mental institution in Charenton, outside of Paris, France, the patients perform a play for a visiting audience of the city's high society. The play was written and directed by the infamous Marquis de Sade (Patrick Magee), a long-term resident of the asylum known throughout the Western world for his scandalous philosophical novels. The play -and sometimes musical- is a reenactment of key events in France's tumultuous recent past. It dramatizes the French Revolution, its aftermath, and the eventual murder of revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat (Ian Richardson) by Charlotte Corday (Glenda Jackson) in 1793. Interspersed throughout the play are monologues by Marat and de Sade that articulate their conflicting socio-political ideologies.

""Marat/Sade"" is a movie of a play -indeed of a play within a play- that was performed by The Royal Shakespeare Company under the direction of Peter Brook in 1967. The play was originally written by playwright Peter Weiss and entitled ""The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade"", which is an accurate, if cumbersome, title. ""Marat/ Sade"" is a film of that play, and it is filmed in a style that draws attention to the fact that we are watching a play. To put it bluntly, it is filmed more awkwardly than well. The style of the play/movie reflects some of the experimental fashions in the art world of the late 1960s. The performances are interesting and heartfelt, but more melodramatic than convincing. The actors are playing performers who suffer from various mental ailments who are in turn playing roles in a play. -Kind of like playing two characters at once. The behavior of the asylum's histrionic inmates sometimes seems to coincide with their particular mental conditions and sometimes seems to be an acting class exercise in various extreme but unlikely emotional states. The chorus and minor players are generic crazies: ugly, outrageous, and pitiful, who seem to exist primarily to be just that. The most interesting aspect of the film is its philosophical monologues by Jean-Paul Marat and the Marquis de Sade. The antics of the mental patients trying to stage a proper full-length play and occasionally being overcome by their madness are funny, but ultimately most of the film just seems like clutter between the far more coherent monologues.

Like most experimental theater, ""Marat/Sade"" is more about spectacle than about presenting a credible story or characters. The Marquis de Sade actually was an inmate at the Asylum at Charenton. And he did write plays which were performed by his fellow inmates for visiting Parisian aristocrats. But those plays have not survived. Whatever de Sade's plays at Charenton were about, they almost certainly had philosophical underpinnings. ""Marat/Sade"" showcases the conflicting ideologies of The Marquis de Sade and Jean-Paul Marat, but it doesn't do it very well. Philosophy also plays second fiddle to spectacle. The monologues are disjointed and none of the ideas are complete. The film toys with themes here and there, and then drops them. Only the idea that humans are violent savages if left unchecked is expressed coherently. Ultimately, ""Marat/Sade"" has the feeling of something that actors, writers, and directors like to create because it exercises their abilities, but that audiences don't like to watch because it isn't valuable beyond that. It's a movie made for performing, not for viewing. In a nutshell, this is 1960s experimental theater. It you like that, you'll probably like this. If you don't, you won't.

The DVD (This refers to the Image Entertainment DVD only.): The disc has very poor sound, as if some  dialogue simply wasn't miked. You'll have to turn the volume way up to hear some of the dialogue and then quickly back down so as not to be deafened. The sound badly needs to be remixed. This disc is full screen; the movie was filmed in a widescreen aspect ratio. Instead of compressing the wider image into a full screen ratio, the sides of the image have simply been chopped off. So you can't see what's going on in the periphery. There are no bonus features on the disc. Basically, this is a bad disc. Image Entertainment usually does better.

973767,4,630508159X,"This 1966 film depicts the Marquis de Sade's imprisonment in a mental asylum and a play that he directs using the other inmates as actors.  The story of Sade was recently related in ""Quills,"" and that film is somewhat similar in tone, but not plot.  Believe it or not, the film is also a musical!  The ""play"" within the movie chronicles events from the French Revolution pertaining to Marat, and is put on for the asylum's leader and the local gentry.  The local gentry are shocked at times, and the asylum leader interrupts the play several times with interjections concerning the play's radical ideas and how the gentry are depicted.  As the play reaches its culmination, the inmates inevitably begin to stage their own revolution.  The action is often confusing, but the emotions conveyed are so intense, that the film can be enjoyed on a visceral level.
The direction of this film is quite brilliant, and it must have been pretty shocking when it was released 36 years ago.  The acting is also very intense and realistic.  Glenda Jackson has her starring debut here and is quite appealing, considering that she's playing a mental asylum inmate.  The only quibble I have with the DVD is the poor sound quality.  Even on DVD, the sound is muddled and the actor's dialogue is often unintelligible, especially during the songs.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not include captions/subtitles, which would have helped immensely (there are no other extras either).

973768,4,630508159X,"MARAT/SADE is the film version of a play that arose from an actor's workshop exploring various theatrical theories expressed by French actor-director-writer Antoine Artard, who extolled a style of performance he described as ""theatre of cruelty""--which, broadly speaking, consists of an assault upon the audience's senses by every means possible.  Ultimately, and although it makes effective use of its setting and the cinematography mirrors the chaos expected of such a situation, the film version of MARAT/SADE is less a motion picture than a record of a justly famous stage play that offers a complex statement re man's savagery.
The story of MARAT/SADE concerns the performance of a play by inmates of an early 1800s insane asylum, with script and direction by the infamous Marquis de Sade.  (While this may sound a bit farfetched, it is based on fact: de Sade was known to have written plays for performance by inmates during his own incarceration in an asylum.)  The story of the play concerns the assasination of the revolutionary Marat by Charotte Corday, but the play itself becomes a debate between various characters, all of which may be read as in someway intrinsically destructive and evil.  Since all the characters are played by mentally-ill inmates of the asylum (the actor playing Marat, for example, is described as a paranoid, and the actress playing Corday suffers from sleeping sickness and meloncholia), the debate is further fueled by their insanity, unpredictability as performers, and the staff's reactions to both their behavior and the often subversive nature of the script they play out.
Patrick Magee as de Sade, Glenda Jackson as the inmate playing Corday (it was her breakout performance), and Ian Richardson as the inmate playing Marat offering impressive performances; indeed, the ensemble cast as a whole is incredibly impressive, and they keep the extremely wordy script moving along with considerable interest.  Even so, it will be obvious that the material works better as a live performance than as a film, and I do not recommend it to a casual viewer; its appeal will be largely limited to the literary and theatrical intelligentsia.  The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer, but beyond this there are no extras of any kind.",1011398400,18,2272,5.177111716621253
973769,5,630508159X,"What a joy to see this revolutionary work finally available on DVD!  British filmmaker Peter Brook takes the stark, naturalistic visual style he applied so effectively in his rendition of ""Lord of the Flies"", and envisions yet another society run amok - This time around, in the bathhouse turned theater of the absurd of the infamous asylum of Charenton, in which the even more infamous Marquis de Sade spent the last ten years of his life.
The time setting is post-revolutionary France; the Age of Enlightenment, and of liberation.  Or is it?  This ragtag troupe of performers, consisting of paranoiacs, melancholiacs, perverts, schizos and all around ""social lepers"" seem to be the casualties of the Renaissance, creating the perfect metaphor of this filmed play-within-a-play.  The radical ideals of the revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat are pitted against the more cynical logic of author de Sade, amidst a sea of churning madness, resulting in an unsettling, confrontational and subversive work which poses uncomfortable questions about the good intentions that bring about social change.
By turns icily philosophical and gut-level emotional, this was probably the first play/film to portray the Marquis de Sade as more of a political figure than the mere depraved smut peddler history had painted him.  Patrick Magee delivers an unforgettable portrait of the Marquis; Glenda Jackson's twitching, lurching Charlotte Corday is an equally memorable film debut; Ian Richardson's Marat is intense, haunting and tormented; and the Royal Shakespeare Company's supporting cast of ""inmates"" is disturbingly convincing.
Perhaps more potentially controversial at the time of its release in 1966, the era of Vietnam disillusionment, Marat/Sade still does a great job of exposing the wrinkles in our supposedly more evolved age, and as such remains a strong and timely work.  Please note: there are TWO DVD versions available ..... this one is the widescreen transfer, it looks and sounds immaculate, and if you are as much a fan of this film as I am, you are in for an ecstatic viewing experience.  So do not be alarmed by the claims of other reviewers bemoaning a grainy pan-and-scan transfer.  Also. contrary to what another viewer wrote, this movie was NOT filmed on the New York stage, though that's what it was intended to look like.  The multiple perspectives created by director Brook mirror the socio-philosophical multiple perspecives portrayed by playwright Weiss, which work well together to give this title its provocative punch.  A primal scream that will echo in the thinking person's mind for some time, Marat/Sade boasts flawless performances, hallucinogenic cinematography and yes, even a smattering of catchy tunes ..... a richly satisfying film on several levels, for the more cerebrally adventurous.",999475200,10,2809,5.363636363636363

The film is grossly grainy, bad even as pan-and-scan goes (there are actually scenes in which a conversation occurs between two people who are BOTH mostly off-screen because the frame occupies the space between), and generally a shameful engineering job.  I'm torn between the politics of saying ""buy it so that a piece of real art can be 'voted for' with dollars"" and saying ""don't support the trash-marketing of a lousy DVD version, wait for the Criterion version.""",980380800,29,602,5.0
973772,5,630508159X,"Forget the hype surrounding the adequate ""Quills.""  Marat Sade is a great film, which ultimately not only blows Quills away, it sends it down the street, around the corner and into the dumpster.  Marat Sade is a true masterpiece, superbly acted by the Royal Shakespeare Company, amazingly well set and cast, well directed and, above all, well written.  Peter Weiss' amazingly provocative and subversive screenplay, which he adapted from his stage play, is a forum for a debate between de Sade and Jean-Paul Marat, one of the main instigators of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution.  Patrick Magee plays the Divine Marquis to perfection.  Note this is not Patrick MacNee, the actor from the Avengers, rather this is the very well renowned British character actor who played the rich elderly victim/victimizer in ""A Clockwork Orange"". Ian Richardson is superb as Marat, and Glenda Jackson is amazing as a somnambulant who plays Charlotte Corday, Marat's assassin.  Unlike Quills, which tries to bludgeon its one dimensional message into you, this play-within-a-film will make you use your brain, like it or not.  Who is truly evil?  Marat? De Sade? The liberal yet tyrannical post-revolutionary heirarchy?  Everyone?  No one?  Does evil even exist?  And while the actors in Quills are OK, they can't do much with the deep-as-a-comic-book charicatures written for them. Sorry Kate, you're really pretty and it was really nice of you to show us your breasts and all, but Quills comes in a far distant second to this cinematic tour-de-force.
One word of caution:  The version of Marat Sade that I have, which was released by I.S. Productions, Inc., is not letterboxed, and suffers because of it in several brief instances.  Try to get a letterbox version.  However, regardless of format, see this important film.",978307200,9,1820,5.101351351351352
7884021,5,630508159X,"Having seen this on stage, as well as owning the dvd, I can understand why some of the reviews come down on the dvd version. In the stage version the actors streamed off the stage and plonked themselves on peoples laps! Its hard to vie with that kind of presence and intensity. However, bear in mind this production is far beyond the ability of most community theater groups to perform. So unless you're lucky enough to be near a professional or really talented college troupe, the dvd is your only viable option. And despite the noted technical issues, its great  youll forget any tech stuff once you become immersed in the performance. Re the person who complained about it not being available in DVD region 2, ever hear of a region-free DVD player? Theyre readily available, and not much more expensive than the other kind.",1524441600,,826,4.696551724137931

7884025,3,630508159X,"This is NOT the version that I saw 40 years ago in a movie theatre in Brooklyn Heights (NYC).  That version was Great; this version is OK, but nowhere near as good (Great)!  What a rip-off!  This version dates to 1966 or 67.  I believe it was filmed in 66 and released in 67?  The version I saw had been released in America for perhaps six months prior to my seeing it in the early-mid 70's.

Principle differences: that version was staged in an open room (in the ""asylum"") with an in-the-round ""stage"" and without a barrier between the audience (actors) and the inmates (actors).  The inmates not participating in any scene were free to circulate within and about the perimeter of the audience.  The camera was generally situated within the audience and you had a very real feeling of being part of the audience; long lenses were often used for close-ups.  The ""inmate"" acting was far more disturbing, their illnesses (lunacy) being presented in a highly realistic manner and not clean nor stylized as in this version.  I got a very real feeling of voyeurism and I felt embarrassed at viewing the personal lunacy afflicting each inmate.  There was a much greater feeling of intimacy and the immediacy of being part of an audience - viewing a live performance.  Additionally, the colors were not washed out and that version also had a fully audible sound track.  Each speech was understandable as were the songs.  These last two items may point toward poor technical standards during the transfer of this version from film to dvd?

That version also had scenes (3 as I recall) with brief intermissions wherein the camera stayed on/in the audience (Gentry living around Paris/Charenton) and/or on the set-up/preparation for the next scene.  And at the end, the inmates, all of them not just those involved with the play, attacked the entire audience as a mob avenging Marat's death.  To sum it up: much, much better acting, much better direction of the play within the movie, much better direction of the entire movie and much, much more creative cinematography.  Who says the Royal Shakespeare Company is good?  Find the version that I saw 40 years ago and you will expose them (RSC) as poorly trained and directed amateurs. That movie was unquestionably one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, despite having no ""Stars"" and its being largely forgotten.  I have a vague recollection that my preferred version, although an English language production, was perhaps filmed in Australia, Canada or maybe New Zealand?  That movie is what this movie should have been.  Without seeing that movie - you have not seen Marat/Sade as it was meant to be seen.  In comparison this movie is insignificant.",1424908800,,2701,4.823913043478261

7884030,5,630508159X,"Essentially, Marat/Sade is a filmed play within a play.  In 1808, the Marquis de Sade directs his fellow inmates in an insane asylum to reenact the murder of Marat during the French Revolution.  They play explores the contradictions of the Revolution: its promise of freedom and equality, juxtaposed with increasing tyranny and misery.  The larger play is a mid/late-20th century work, however, with asides to a post-atomic, modern audience that still read as relevant in the 21st century.

The acting is pure RSC, and it occasionally jarred me to see these very, very British performances of French people discussing French Revolution, but the Royal Shakespeare Company, as ever, is fantastic.  Really, this is a movie where you put a bunch of superb actors in a room with some interesting blocking and a good script and let them do their thing, and it's high art.  It's also weird, disturbing, and heavily ironic, including considerable violence (real and theatrical).  It's not a feel-good story, but it's absolutely a memorable one.",1361577600,2,1036,5.130952380952381
