3952064,5,B002M9WW5I,"This collection really lets you get to know RDJ in some of his earlier roles.  Charlie Bartlett, in particular, is one of my favorites! It's definitely a must-have for any RDJ fan.",1301097600,9,180,4.625
3952065,5,B002M9WW5I,"This movie collection is a great way to economically catch up on many of the lesser-known RDJ movies which can be hard to find, but are well worth watching multiple times.",1284681600,10,171,4.548387096774194
8373734,5,B002M9WW5I,"If you love RDJ, you simply have to have this collection. Not necessarily the films I would have put together in one pack but I was happy to own them nonetheless. I am grateful I made this purchase.",1503964800,,198,4.2368421052631575
8373735,2,B002M9WW5I,Not 4 of his better movies.,1494892800,,27,3.6666666666666665
8373736,3,B002M9WW5I,"Careless, bargain format package. Two of the discs have no art at all, just center id of the movie in small print. Richard III has no subtitles, which is a travesty for a Shakespearean film of this critical acclaim. So, be aware that you will get the four films, but in a ""bargain"" format, as befits the price.",1474243200,2,310,4.362068965517241
8373737,4,B002M9WW5I,"As an update to my previous review, I reordered the film collection, and received the correct movie this time (although there was no cover artwork, unfortunately), but the gif twas a great success!",1418083200,,197,5.0
8373738,4,B002M9WW5I,Skakespeare will never be the same. In a film filled with brilliant actors and actresses Robert Downey Jr stole every scene he was in.,1374796800,2,134,4.625
8373739,5,B002M9WW5I,Ok this was a very well put together movie.. I am so glad I have it in my collection... as I could not imagine this movie out of it!,1372809600,,132,3.586206896551724
8373740,4,B002M9WW5I,"Good movie for any Robert Downey, Jr. fan.  His role was very good.  The story line keeps up with teen problems that still exist todat.",1370131200,,135,4.36
8373741,4,B002M9WW5I,"These movies show a very yound Downey in Back to School.  Funny geeky and altogether not Downey now.  But still good.  He is the kid everyone wanted as a friend in High School and College.  In Charlie Bartlett he is a principal who needs to learn more about his daughter.  Good movie, but Downey just doesnt fit the principal image.  I cant see him doing that job.  You keep waiting for him to tell someone off in his usual style.  And in the final movie the Shakespeare role while Downey is good, there isn't much of him on screen to compare.  Total surprise how he ends up.  But then I never read King Lear.  I never liked Shakespeare and this telling of it isn't much to go by.",1365379200,,680,4.234375
8373742,4,B002M9WW5I,"loved Back to School and Charlie Bartlett, lost interest in Richard III when Downey's character killed off, and Home for the Holidays was better than I thought it would be.",1361318400,,172,4.766666666666667
