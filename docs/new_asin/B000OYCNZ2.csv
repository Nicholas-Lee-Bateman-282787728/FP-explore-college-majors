2804576,1,B000OYCNZ2,"I ordered this DVD from Target, and too late discovered that ""The Complete First Season"" means just that, but ""The Complete First Season - Disk 1"" (this DVD) means you get seven episodes out of the first season.  I didn't notice the difference until I opened the DVD.  Since there is no ""Complete First Season - Disk Two"" out there, I will need to purchase the other DVD to get all of the episodes.  What a waste of money.  Part of this is my fault, I should have read the discription, but part of this feels like Warners is trying to put one over on the customer.  They released the entire first season in 2004, and in 2007 released these seven episodes with the same cover and nearly the same title.  Easy to confuse the two, and Warners Home Videos profits from the confusion.",1231545600,13,779,4.375

I wanted him to see this family in action.  Joshua watched the shows one behind the other. Did not get out of the chair.  I had to stop him, and told him he can watch more another day.
Thank you so much.
