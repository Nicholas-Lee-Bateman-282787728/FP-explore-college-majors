8260829,5,B00164JPNM,"The dvd is so encouraging to the heart. There is a message there for so many. It reminds us that God has a Blessing even for those who feel forgotten and down and out. Mr George Dean and the Gospel Four have become one of my favorite groups, right next to Lee Williams and the Q'cs.  I often go to Memphis several times in a year, I will have to look him up. May God continue to Bless The Gospel Four. Much Love, Thia.",1320192000,,418,3.9761904761904763
