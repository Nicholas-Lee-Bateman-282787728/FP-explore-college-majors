It was fun to see the old theatre up and running again, but it's a shame it was a tease in the end with it closing again. Almost felt like the good folks on Taveuni were taken advantage of for the sake of a movie. I really am surprised I felt this way in the end.",1456876800,,337,3.8285714285714287
8100420,2,B000CQM4JM,remarked this as a great story. I don't think so. Most of the children and some grownups are fine. However too many adults you really wouldn't want to associate with.,1397606400,,166,4.566666666666666
8100421,5,B000CQM4JM,"Reel Paradise is a fascinating documentary about a man in the independent movie industry, John Pierson, who decides he needs a break from the stress of his life in America. He and his family go to the remote Fijian island of Taveuni to live there for one year in a rented house and they show free movies at a local theater. The cinematography is excellent; everything was very nicely done in that realm. The film gives us a wonderful portrait of people from two cultures getting to know each other and each other's cultures at the same time that many American movies bring much happiness and joy to the local residents of the Fijian island. I do have one cautionary note for you, though: There is some language and imagery in this film that makes me want to warn adults that this is not a children's film.

The people who live in the village are thrilled to have free movies every night and the theater is very popular, so much so that the theater is full many a night even if it is run down. John Pierson has to build gates and remind everyone not to run, push or crowd into the theater at the speed of lightning. On one occasion when John is too ill with fever to open the theater, he lets his son Wyatt open the theater; and Wyatt does a marvelous job of it. We also see Wyatt and his sister Georgia Pierson screening everyone to make sure that they are at least sixteen years old before they can enter the theater to see a certain movie; but admittedly you have to look closely to observe that.

During the course of a year so much can happen; but this documentary film focuses on the last month of the year so that we can observe the Pierson family when they were as close with the local residents as they were ever going to be. It's great to see both of their children, Wyatt and Georgia, becoming very good friends with the local children despite the fact that many of the residents haven't truly mastered the English language. We see Wyatt and Georgia go to school as well.

Of course, not everything in life is positive. The documentary shows footage taken after the Pierson's rented home has been robbed--for the second time. Their computer and some other possessions have been taken despite the fact that the doorway to their bedroom where the things were was padlocked! They call the local police who don't seem to be familiar even with the basics of taking fingerprints; and their Australian landlord Andrew comes by at midnight to say that he's ""concerned""--and then Andrew hands John Pierson an electric bill for over 300 dollars the very night he was robbed.

We also get a fine understanding of John's wife Janet. She makes it clear, especially after the second robbery, that she doesn't completely trust any of the local residents there. She worries that they could be vulnerable to numerous robberies because the locals will see them as the wealthy Americans who came to show free movies--and so their money and possessions can be stolen without the Pierson family feeling any financial drain. Ouch!

Although you may think I've spilled all the beans, I haven't. There's plenty of footage that will fascinate you every bit as much as it did me; and there are a few other subjects and conflicts that I will not mention here. In addition, the DVD comes with quite a few nice extras. There are deleted scenes and a featurette entitled ""Split Screen: `The Fiji Stooges.'"" There's even an alternate ending--and more!

Overall, Reel Paradise is one of the best documentaries I've seen. It highlights what it's like to go so far away from home that the culture shock is enormous; the extensive footage we see gives us a clear understanding of just how special and almost unique the Pierson's family experience really was. I highly recommend this documentary for people interested in the issues raised in this film.",1242777600,,3826,4.6191176470588236
8100422,3,B000CQM4JM,"When John Pierson decided to move his wife, son and daughter to Taveuni in the Fiji islands for a year, he clearly had a few things he wanted to accomplish.  On the surface the objective was to run the local island movie house, the 180 Meridian Cinema.  But since cameras are rolling from day one, producing this documentary was clearly a bigger objective in the adventure.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reel-Paradise/dp/B000CQM4JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reel Paradise</a>&nbsp;is kind of like a very small accident.  Even though there is not too much happening, you still can't look away.  While there is some drama, it seems like very little really happens considering this movie covers an entire year of this family's life in Fiji.  Still, there is something happening here that is worth watching.  However, considering the deliberate and organized way their lives were filmed, one has to wonder how planned out the events in this *documentary* really were.  So perhaps this is less documentary than it is reality TV captured in the guise of independent film.

The most interesting aspect of this documentary for me is clearly the way the Pierson children react to the various experiences.  On the one hand, they each get the unique experience of going to school and interacting with kids in a very different culture.  The younger son, Wyatt, seems to adjust with little effort.  But the Pierson's teenage daughter seems to be going through a rebellious stage, willfully ignoring her parent's wishes.

While some might judge the Pierson parents for their lax parenting style and highly permissive approach, I found the family interactions fascinating.  I give them the benefit of the doubt.  In the end, they did something that takes a lot of courage: they put their family on film for the world to see, unafraid of the judgment to follow.

Another thing they have been criticized for is showing *inappropriate* movies to minors.  While some people in attendance might not meet the American age recommendations for all the movies they showed, it's not really fair to assume that U.S. social norms should rule what is appropriate in a foreign country.  I don't think it's too much of a stretch for young children to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000AYELVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>, and they also screen classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges/dp/B000SSQ7JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges</a>&nbsp;and some silent films.  There is a point where they show the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B000FSME1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>&nbsp;and Wyatt doesn't allow in kids who are under 16, so they do set some limits.

In a sense, this film is more about human interaction than anything else.  The scenes are all small vignettes, some of which are very clich and others that are quite touching.  When the locals are filmed commenting on the Piersons, it shows the difficulties that arise from people of two different cultures trying to coexist.  John is portrayed as bossy, which he sometimes is.  At other times, the locals are overly judgmental and quick to lump the Pierson's in with former colonialists and racists.

Where the film falters is in weaving together the story cohesively.  Many times the narrative turns to conjecture, and lengthy opinionated rants.  We go from angry fights over who was responsible for missing items, to locals physically fighting, to John discussing at length what a great kid Wyatt is.

And yet, when some of those rants are incorporated with the story you have some of the film's best moments.  Part of the appeal of this movie is the story of the stereotypical ""ugly Americans overseas.""  And there is plenty of that.

While the movie is interesting, the lack of fluidity in the storytelling makes it difficult to really enjoy.  I will admit that, like a train wreck, I cannot look away when this movie is on.  But it's a very small wreck, unfortunately.

So if you enjoy reality TV, just imagine your neighbors being filmed living overseas for a year.  If that sounds interesting, there is a pretty good chance you may enjoy this film.  But if you are not into that kind of entertainment, this movie will probably leave you un-offended yet uninspired.

Enjoy.",1225152000,,4479,5.553097345132743
8100423,1,B000CQM4JM,"Did anyone notice that this man was showing totally inappropriate fims to children...ages infant to teenagers? I think this shows his total contempt for the children and the parents of the island.

If we had watched a film of American children watching such films as Jackass (where men stick things up their butts, and worse, etc) wouldn't we have found it to be sick? The attitude here seems to be, they are natives so who cares.

I know children are exposed to lots of things in life, but this shows total disrespect to them.

If you want to watch a film about Ugly Americans, this is it.

If you are expecting a film about bringing films to people living on a remote island and what their reactions are, this ISN'T it.",1208822400,3,721,4.480916030534351
8100424,2,B000CQM4JM,I was so excited to see this movie. I envisioned Jon Pierson as a venturing Rick Steves type. Unfortunately even after a year in paradise he still had an edgy up-tight annoying personality. I would have hated to see him *before* he took this trip to paradise.,1189641600,,259,4.531914893617022
8100425,5,B000CQM4JM,"Loved it; it's at once compelling, complex, and authentic.

I highly recommend the ""commentary"" audio also -- Steve James and doc subject Janet Pierson intertwine comments in a way that reveals the subjectivity inherent (but not always obvious) in any documentary film.  Steve's discussion of the subtleties of story-telling craft and Janet's nuanced comments on perception transcend the specifics of the film to shed light on documentary in general.",1167264000,4,450,5.507246376811594
8100426,4,B000CQM4JM,"I was totally entertained by this film about an American family who leave their comfortable life in New York to spend a year in Taveuni, one of the Fiji islands.  The impetus was Dad's need for a little time off from his career in independent films.  Dad, John Pierson, known as the independent film ""guru,"" purchases an old movie theater and shows free movies to the natives of Taveuni.

  I enjoyed learning about daily life on the island and seeing the natives' reactions to the movies;  but most interesting was watching the personable and articulate Piersons experience life in a world so exotically different from their own.  Janet, John, Georgia, and Wyatt are shown as four distinct individuals, and we get intimate views of their interactions with one another as well as with their Taveuni friends and neighbors.  Actually, I wasn't surprised to find how good ""Reel Paradise"" is.  It was directed by Steve James who made the equally absorbing basketball documentary ""Hoop Dreams.""",1144195200,4,989,4.9817073170731705
8100427,2,B000CQM4JM,"Strange little film that showed the Pierson family to be of a very different stripe. One example: while the family is in Fiji for the year, and the final month being chronicled on film, the subject of the Pierson's 16 year-old daughter having sex comes up in an interview with the mother. The MOTHER says, ""She's sixteen and it's not up to me to tell someone how much sex to have..."" That should be enough to show you that this is either a very unusual family - or they exploited their lovely daughter for their own purposes in the making of the film. Very sad. Where was the parenting? I suppose this mother would have considered it, ""old-fashioned."" But seriously, what was the purpose of discussing the daughter's sex life at all? And then for mom to condone it as if it's none of her business? Very odd.

The film has some pretty scenery, but to be brutally honest, that was the only part of the hour and a half that held my interest.",1140048000,3,938,4.390804597701149
8100428,5,B000CQM4JM,"Reel Paradise features a family of four intelligent, talented, articulate people from America-parents John and Janet Pierson, daughter Georgia, and son Wyatt, who go to Fiji to reopen an abandoned movie theatre.

The effect they have on the culture of the island and the effect the island has on them produces a story that grabbed this viewer from the outset and held me to the end.  Frankly, when I see two adults who are willing to tackle a project so far out in left field like this and then two children who are so witty and able to adapt to new surroundings in such a hurry, I have greater respect for my fellow human beings.

Director Steve James gives an unsparing view of the stresses and strains - and the triumphs -- of being in this situation.  And the Piersons are to be commended to letting the lens peer into their homelife. Frankly, I think that they shine through the whole process.  And as for Wyatt and Georgia, if I had kids, I could only hope that they would be so bright.

This film intrigues the viewer on several levels:

--Seeing the reaction of the Fiji natives to the films.

--Observing the adaptive capabilities of the Piersons.

--All the subplots like the Catholic Church's negative reaction to the Piersons giving the natives free admittance to the films and Wyatt's taking over the announcing one night, not to mention the landlord scene.

If you want to spend a couple of hours immersed in another culture, Reel Paradise is a great way to do just that.",1139270400,8,1485,4.590909090909091
