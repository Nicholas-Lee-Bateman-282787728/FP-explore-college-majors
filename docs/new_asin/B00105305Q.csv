3048010,4,B00105305Q,"Here is the full episode guide to ""Curious George Goes to the Doctor and Lends a Helping Hand"". Amazon doesn't include the episode list and what each is about in their description, so hope this helps those who are wondering....like I was (: My toddler is in love with Curious George!

""Doctor Monkey"" - George visits the doctor's office and discovers that a stethoscope is a pretty handy thing to have around when you're trying to find a mysterious sound.

""Housebound"" - George learns about bones the hard way when he falls and breaks his leg. But a visit to the hospital and a cast on his leg aren't going to keep George down.

""Curious George, Stain Remover"" - George spilled grape juice on the new rug and finds that some simple engineering and a little help from his friends are needed to clean things up.

""Curious George Fixes Betsy's Wagon"" - George and Steve borrow Betsy's wagon to pick up a package, but on the way they lose a wheel. Can they find some way to keep that wagon rolling?

""Curious George On Time"" - Hickory-dickory-dock, there's a monkey inside the clock! George explores the inside of the big library clock and discovers how gears make it work.

""Curious George, Plumber's Helper"" - When some of George's bath toys go down the drain and cause a clog, he gets a few plumbing lessons from Mr. Auger, plumber extraodinaire!

""Grease Monkey In Space"" - George and The Man with the Yellow Hat take a trip into space to repair a large telescope. George only has a few minutes to remember his right, his left and his shapes before his space walk turns into a space ""whoops"".

""Curios George Gets All Keyed Up"" - Betsy's big xylophone concert is tonight, but George has mixed up all the keys. He has to use his eyes and ears to figure out what order the keys go in before Betsy takes the stage.

**DVD-ROM Feature: Printable Coloring Pages.

**Bonus Features: ""Fix Betsy's Wagon"" Game. ""Keys To The Xylophone"" Game.",1378944000,8,1933,4.576811594202899
3048011,5,B00105305Q,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,6,827,4.235668789808917

3282508,5,B00105305Q,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,6,827,4.235668789808917
