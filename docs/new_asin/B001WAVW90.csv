I am very happy with Murphy Henrys DVD's that I purched through your company,  They are just what I needed to get
started with my Mandolin,  The DVD's are all very easy to follow, as a beginner I am finding them very helpful,  so glad that
I was told about them by a friend.  Thank you for the prompt delivery of these goods.  I will certainly get many more
purchases through your company",1370390400,,435,4.430379746835443
