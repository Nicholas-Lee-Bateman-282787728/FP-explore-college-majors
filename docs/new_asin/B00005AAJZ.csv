7935153,3,B00005AAJZ,"""The Big Steal"" is a 1949 black and white crime drama often mistakenly labeled ""film noir"". It concerns an Army officer (Robert Mitchum) accused of stealing a $300,000 payroll who is hot on the trail of the real thief (Patric Knowles) while he himself is being hounded by his superior officer (William Bendix). It all ends up in a frantic chase through the Mexican countryside with the thief's girlfriend (Jane Greer) in tow and the Mexican police (Ramon Navarro) along for the ride.

Mitchum and Greer had appeared two years earlier in the film noir classic ""Out of the Past"". Mitchum (1917-97) was one of the kings of film noir (""When Strangers Marry"", ""Undercurrent"", ""The Locket"", ""Pursued"", ""Crossfire""). He received his only Oscar nomination for ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum's work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962) is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time.

FWIW - this film was made right after Mitchum's first conviction for possession of marijuana, and the producers had trouble getting a female star, which opened the door for Greer.

Cute 24 year old Jane Greer (1924-2001) was one of the queens of film noir, featured in the excellent book ""Dark City Dames"" by Eddie Muller. She had a successful career in films and later on TV, but never really made the A list.

William Bendix (1906-64) is best remembered from the radio and TV series ""Life of Riley"" (1949-50, 1953-8). He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for ""Wake Island"" (1942), but I think his best performances were in ""Lifeboat"" (1944), ""The Babe Ruth Story"" (1948), and ""Connecticut Yankee"" (1949). This film is one of the few times he played a heavy.

Ramon Navarro (1899-1968) was the ""latin lover"" successor to Rudolph Valentino and very popular through the mid 30s when MGM cancelled his contract partly as a result of an early ""red scare"". This is one of the few USA films he made in the later part of his career.

Director Don Siegel (1912-91) was one of the most popular directors of the late 20th century. Although he never won an Oscar or a DGA, his films were consistently well received - ""Escape from Alcatraz"" (1979), ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""The Shootist"" (1976), ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" (1970). My favorite Don Siegel film is one of his early ones - ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956).

The NY Times praised the ""breathtaking scenic excursion across the landscape of Mexico"" and the ""good fast direction"". Variety called it ""a good chase yarn""

The big Oscar winners in 1949 were ""Hamlet"" (Picture, Actor, Art Direction, Costume Design) and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor). The top box office hits were ""Samson and Delilah"", ""Battleground"", ""Jolson Sings Again"", ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"", and ""I Was a Male Order Bride"". Other notable films that year were ""All the King's Men"", ""Champion"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"" and ""White Heat"".

Bottom line - an entertaining chase film with some good performances and fast paced direction.

BUT...

Don't go looking for film noir. There is nothing film noir about this film, apart from the fact that the two leading actors were well known for other film noir roles. Here are some relevant film noir conventions -

* Lots of night scenes - this one is shot in stark daylight
* Lots of shadows - nope, broad daylight
* Use of rain - nope, lots of sunshine
* Uban area - mostly in rural Mexico
* Unusual camera angles - nope, pretty standard stuff
* Gang of seedy characters - not really
* Unhappy ending - no, they ride off into the sun",1336521600,,3743,4.777089783281734
7935154,5,B00005AAJZ,"If you liked ""Out Of The Past,"" you'll love ""The Big Steal""
It's a better movie.  Funny, interesting, and Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer are fabulous together.
William Bendix is the bad guy, who gets frustrated at every turn, trying to catch our two lovers down in Mexico.
They outfox him time after time, and he shows his total frustration and hostility.
But if you want to be thoroughly entertained, and like to watch something that makes you feel like it was well worth your while, get this one.",1322438400,,497,4.584269662921348
7935155,4,B00005AAJZ,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""THE BIG STEAL"" (1949) (71 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Jane and Duke (alias Capt. Blake) accidently meet in Vera Cruz while chasing flim-flam man Fiske. Soon the local Inspector General (El Gato) is involved. Fiske races across Mexico, pursued by Jane and Duke, trailed by the real Capt. Blake. The crafty Inspector General is waiting for them in Tihuacan but they all give him the slip, just in time for the climactic finale. A well made robbery caper set in Mexico and shot on location, this film is full of terrific plot twists and benefits from a very tight script and pacing.

The Big Steal is noir-on-a-tear, a raggedy little B-feature built for speed with everyone going along for the ride --- No wonder. Screenwriter Holmes/ Mainwaring gifts Mitchum and Greer with as much keen, noir-induced dialogue and as many slippery story twists as you could hope for --- A thoroughly high-spirited effort but shouldn't be dismissed as just a breezy comedy-suspenser and a no-account noir because of it --- While contrived humor can be poisonous to film noir, that`s not `The Big Steal's problem because Seigel avoids it.

The Big Steal is so good and is not to be overlooked --- It's a great piece of entertainment and also features a very good performance by William Bendix --- Not in the same league with ""Out Of The Past"", just enjoy ""The Big Steal"" for what it is, a thriller that is a great ride and fun film.

7935156,5,B00005AAJZ,"I put this on, not expecting much, but was immediately swept into the story by the mocking admiration that Mitchum and Greer immediately display.  They are electrifying together and, though this is kind of a comedy film noire, they are truly believable.  I loved watching them as the caper got more and more complicated.  In classic noire mode, what you think in the beginning is completely transformed by the end.

There are many things that make this special.  I particularly liked the intelligent mexican cop, who decided to let the big boys fight amongst themselves on behalf of his own unknown agenda.  He is learning english and makes hilarious mistakes, all the time charming the murderous protagonists in a game of cat and mouse.  The location also makes it very fun, in Mexico where the gruff Mitchum must struggle to communicate while the amused Greer looks on in comical superiority.

Warmly recommended. This is one of the best film noirs I have yet seen.",1294099200,,967,4.853658536585366
7935157,4,B00005AAJZ,It's a shame that this fun gem of a movie pairing Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer (Out of the Past) is still NOT available on DVD!!!,1169596800,,130,4.038461538461538
7935158,5,B00005AAJZ,"I totally agree with Wally, this is a great film, fortunately; I did get this on tape recently in the 2 hour speed and the copy is pristine. It is a welcome addition to my collection until someone at the studio ""pulls their head out"" and puts this on DVD.",1160870400,,255,4.12
7935159,5,B00005AAJZ,"I can't believe that with  Fox and other studios releasing their film noir classics from the 1940'S/early '50's, that RKO and it's parent company have not found a way to release this gem ""The Big Steal.""  I've only seen it on AMC and missed the rare (very early) morning airings on TCM. For my money, it's much more interesting than ""Out of the Past"", which also stars Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, along with Kirk Douglas, with travels to Mexcio and the relationship between Mitchum and Greer's characters.  I'm giving it 5 stars for the tv airing and hoping that an eventual DVD copy will not be a ""Big Steal"" for some distibutor, but excellent.",1158278400,2,648,4.6173913043478265
