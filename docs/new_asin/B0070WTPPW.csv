5046413,5,B0070WTPPW,"Have really enjoyed watching European TV dramas of late and this one is no exception.  I so appreciate good acting, taut scripts, and engaging production values.  I also like shows that have strong women as leads.  European women are allowed to look like real people as opposed to their gauzy, perfectly coiffed U.S. counterparts.  Like other shows from this genre, things can get a tad dark, but the plots are generally engaging and the characters well drawn.",1409356800,6,460,4.935064935064935
5046414,3,B0070WTPPW,"Those Who Kill Series in A&E Network / LMN Network is based on these characters, but only based. This series is very relaxed in comparison to the characters played by James D'Arcy and Chole Sevigny",1401926400,3,197,4.6571428571428575
5046415,5,B0070WTPPW,"If you enjoyed the Killing, this is another to add to your collection.  Laura Bach is brilliant and the profiling adds to the story line.",1372636800,10,137,4.48
8507830,5,B0070WTPPW,"Excellent crime series!  I've been buying foreign films with subtitles for a while since I can't tolerate the super-sized, sensationalized, blown way out of proportion and immorality coming from Hollywood.  These characters wear very little make-up, don't always have straight and pearly white teeth.  No, they are genuine which makes these films more believable than Hollywood.  They don't have cars that flip 6 times and blow up in flames 10 times before the person walks away unscathed!  They feel like real crime and how the people work as a team to solve them.  Altogether great.",1516924800,2,584,5.094736842105263
8507831,5,B0070WTPPW,"Those Who Kill is a 2010 Danish murder mystery and thriller series, created and written by the best-selling Danish crime novelist Elsebeth Egholm and screenwriter Stefan Jaworski, and broadcast by TV2 Denmark. It is comprised of five feature-length episodes, each of which focuses on a separate serial murder mystery.  The story line of Those Who Kill centers around a highly-specialized division within the Copenhagen Police Department, which is dedicated to the investigation of gruesome serial killings. This special homicide unit consists of a supervisory command officer, two veteran detectives, a forensic pathologist, and a behavioral psychologist. This behavioral psychologist is essentially a profiler, and he methodically formulates a detailed profile of each serial killer based on the forensic evidence, his insight and intuition, and his substantial previous experience. There are many clever plot twists, which serve to challenge the viewer throughout the course of the series. Those Who Kill is an exceptionally intelligent and intriguing detective procedural series, because it systematically delineates the investigative process by which the serial killer is ultimately identified and apprehended. In addition, the atmosphere of Those Who Kill is exceedingly dark and foreboding, in the classic Nordic Noir cinematic style. The performances of the lead actors, Laura Bach, Jakob Cedergren, Lars Mikkelsen, Frederik Meldal Norgaard, and Laerke Winther Andersen are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the talented members of the supporting cast. Those Who Kill is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Those Who Kill features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1508716800,2,1921,5.860714285714286

8507834,5,B0070WTPPW,"This is the original Danish series that was later remade with Chloe Sevigny. Katrine is a police detective in a unit that pursues serial killers, and in the series she has just met Thomas, a criminal psychologist who used to work with the police but left under a cloud.

The series was originally planned to be several seasons long, but was cancelled due to poor ratings. A tragedy! This is such a good show, with interesting cases and great characters (and acting). It was originally broadcast in ten episodes but here they are formatted as six 1-1/2 hour episodes.

The remake with Sevigny and James D'Arcy was also great but was also cancelled before the end of the first season and later the remaining episodes of the season were shown on another network. Such a pity. These were characters who had a lot more to tell, and Katrine's backstory promised a very creepy and disturbing confrontation with her stepfather. (This plotline was handled much better in the American version.)

Unfortunately cancelled, but you can still see the first season of this fascinating and well executed series. In Danish with English subtitles, this can be viewed with a multi-region dvd player.",1446768000,3,1180,4.89

But no, this show didn't grip my attention, or stayed in my collection.",1439510400,,154,5.2

8507838,5,B0070WTPPW,There aren't enough stars to show how much I enjoyed this series.  Extremely compelling and unpredictable.  Went into depression/withdrawal after viewing the last episode.  Bring on another series please.,1420416000,4,204,5.9655172413793105
8507839,4,B0070WTPPW,"I really like this series. Nevertheless, while the DVD indicates ""the complete Series"" this DVD set is missing ""An Eye for an Eye"" and ""Deadly Game""; and then there's the ""Shadow of the Past"" movie as  well.",1420329600,3,207,4.594594594594595
