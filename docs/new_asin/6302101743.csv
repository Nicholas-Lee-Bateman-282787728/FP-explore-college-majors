424766,4,6302101743,"The Valley Of Gwangi was a script prepared in 1940 by Willis O'Brien, the SFX technician responsible for King Kong.  His apprentice, Ray Harryhausen, acquired a copy of the script, but when O'Brien's project was aborted,  Harryhausen forgot about it until in 1966, having wrapped up work on One  Million Years B.C., Harryhausen and producer-friend Charles Schneer found  the script in Harryhausen's garage, and decided to film it.  William Bast  was brought it to make changes; originally set in 1940, the story was  pushed back to circa 1900.
The film's genesis proved to be most  troubling.  Schneer and Harryhausen's primary distributor, Columbia  Pictures, felt the film would be too expensive (it called for much more in  the way of stop-motion animation and film-splicing FX than previous  Harryhausen projects), but Ken Myler of Seven Arts (which had financed One  Million Years B.C.) liked the project and took it to Warner Brothers when  Seven Arts bought into the film company.
Filming took two years and was  plagued with problems.  There were reports of controversies with director  James O'Connelly (Harryhausen wound up directing the majority of the film,  though it was mostly because of the sheer quantity of  stop-motion/splitscreen effects work needed) and also spats between Schneer  and the film's musical composer, Jerome Moross.  There was also the matter  of Israeli actress Gina Golan, cast as the film's heroine, T.J.  Breckenridge; Golan could not speak fluent English, so her voice had to be  dubbed for the entire film.
Then, when the film was finished, Ken Myler  left Warner Brothers-Seven Arts, and the new management wanted nothing to  do with the film, so they dumped it on the market with little more than a  poster and a coming attractions trailer as publicity.  The bitter  experience almost drove Harryhausen out of movies.
The film could have  been a huge hit, because it is very entertaining, highlighted by Jerome  Moross' thrilling score (Moross used a large orchestra, a luxury becoming  extinct in the budget-crunched movie industry of 1968-9), great  performances by James Franciscus, Richard Carlson, and company, and  animation by Harryhausen that is among his finest.  The allosaur Gwangi is  quite an energetic beast, and his battles with a belligerent styracosaur  and later a circus elephant (this scene has been unfairly criticized  because the elephant is depicted as too large and moving a bit too  smoothly) are thrilling and at times a bit overpowering.  Contributing  mightily to the film's adrenaline rush is awe-inspiring sound editing and  FX; the growling voices of Gwangi and the styracosaur are far deeper and  more menacing than monster voices in previous Harryhausen films; even when  the beasts simply breathe, the menace is unmistakable; the echo effect when  Gwangi prowls through a huge church late in the film is brilliantly  realized.
The human characters are often overlooked in reviews of the  film, for they succeed in holding it all together.  Tuck Kirby (James  Franciscus) and T.J. Breckenridge are sparring over ownership of a  struggling wild west show, but bite of more than they can chew when the  discovery of a tiny horse - a prehistoric Eohippus, tenderly animated by  Harryhausen - leads to The Forbidden Valley.  The human characters are put  through the emotional wringer as they fight, reconcile, fight again, team  up to battle the dinosaurs, and succeed in bringing Gwangi to captivity.  But Tuck has had his fill, and wants no part of T.J's scheme to use Gwangi  as part of the show.  When Gwangi is freed by gypsies, he kills the  elephant (a battle that is quite gory for a G-rated film) and traps Tuck  and T.J. in a church, where he is killed when a flaming brazier sets the  place afire.  The climatic fire rips at the audience as Gwangi wails in its  death throes, and we are left feeling guilty at the creature's death.
The  film's extremely unhappy ending is uncharacteristic of a Ray Harryhausen  film, and may be why Harryhausen has admitted that the film is not one of  the favorites he has done.  He should feel more pride in it, though, for it  is a true masterpiece of his.",927849600,16,4177,5.008771929824562

Cowpokes head into a mysterious Mexican valley to head em up and move em out. But they're not looking for little doggies. Theyre looking for great big dinosaurs.

James Franciscus stars in this thunderous adventure featuring amazing special effects by Ray Harryhausen [The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Clash of the Titans]. James Franciscus plays a Wild West showman who leads his riding and roping crew into the title region, where prehistoric giants still roam. Thanks to Ray Harryhausen wizardry, fantastic creatures lunge, fight and rampage in scene after dazzling scene, including an awesome sequence where the cowboys rope Gwangi, a razor-toothed Allosaurus. Saddle up and join the excitement.

FILM FACT: THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI was the last dinosaur- themed film that Ray Harryhausen animated, and he made much use of his experience in depicting extinct animals from his earlier films. Close to a year was spent on the special effects and there were more than 300 Dynamation cuts in the film, a record number for Ray Harryhausen, especially with the roping of the Gwangi being the most labour-intensive animated sequence ever. The THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI was filmed in Almera and Cuenca in Spain. The bullring scenes were shot in Almera in the Plaza de Toros and the finale at Cuenca's cathedral. Some scenes with dinosaurs like the Pteranodon scene or the fight between the Allosaurus and Styracosaurus were filmed in Almera in the Tabernas Desert. The unusual rock formations of Ciudad Encantada, which is a geological site near the city of Cuenca that were used for the forbidden valley scenes in the film.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI [1969] finds Tuck Kirby [James Franciscus], Teresa (nicknamed T.J.) [Gila Golan] and Champ [Richard Carlson] star in this James O'Connolly directed helmed cult hit, featuring the animation work of Ray Harryhausen, where at the turn of the century we find a Wild West show struggling to make a living in Mexico where they come into the possession of a tiny prehistoric horse. This leads to an expedition to the Forbidden Valley where they discover living dinosaurs and they capture one and take it back to be put on display, where we find a team of cowboys, led by the impresario figure Tuck Kirby, capture a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a hidden valley in Mexico and they then decide to reveal as the chief attraction in their circus with very bad results, leading to inevitable mayhem.

Directed by Jim O'Connolly and written by William E. Bast, and there are few films as influential as THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI when it comes to thrilling anti-hero antics and special effects, especially the  filmmaking  is dazzled by the visual thrill of cowboys lassoing dinosaurs and the films influence can be seen in everything from Jurassic Park to the even more brilliant Cowboys & Aliens and the artists who worked on these films studied each and every frame to understand the what and the how in Ray Harryhausens stop-motion creations.

THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI is based on an original idea from a scrapped project by the brilliant Ray Harryhausens mentor, Willis O'Brien, and of course was the man behind the stop-motion effects in the film King Kong itself. Ray Harryhausen, who perfected what Willis OBrien began, and was a certifiable star himself by the time this film began its life and of course Ray Harryhausen was acting out through the amazing creations he brought to life; each possessing a character all its own. Audiences loved it, especially young children. The intricacy in his work was often taken for granted, though, that didn't change with the arrival of this film in 1969.

THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI would not exist without Ray Harryhausen, and neither would it be any good without his tireless work. From the beginning, this was a personal project for the animator, in bringing to life a film that had personal connection that shows throughout the film. With stop-motion special effects that took nearly a year to complete, this is some of Ray Harryhausens finest work. The subtlety of characterisation and movement is remarkable. Forget the actors; the monsters are the stars of this brilliant film.

The Gwangi, as a character, holds our attention from the minute the dinosaur monster appears on screen and says something about the production value and especially about the Ray Harryhausen's professional artistry when we realise that the Gwangi, the snarling dinosaur created from a table top model, is the most realistically alive character on the screen, and the same goes for the creature that sparks off the foray into the secret valley, especially the tiny Eohippus (Dawn Horse) which is so cute and adorable.

THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI is full of all sorts of jaw-snapping dinosaurs, the show-stopping cowboys versus dinosaurs set-up, where our loyalties are undeniably with the dinosaur. The cowboys themselves and all the characters actually, with the exception of Tuck Kirbys young sidekick Lope are pretty objectionable, doubly so for a contemporary audience. Gwangi, on the other hand, is just so full of life. His movements are fluid and intricate and its easy to forget that hes a creation of a painstaking frame-by-frame process. Yes, hes a roaring, snarling, stampeding dinosaur. And it is this scene in which Ray Harryhausen combines live-action with intricate animation skills and creates a truly unforgettable cinematic wonder that has grown in influence to become the benchmark of important and lasting visual effects. Many visual artists have studied this scene to help with their own understanding of the articulation their own work who were heavily influenced by the master that was Ray Harryhausen, who honestly creates one of his most fully realised monsters with the Gwangi, who does not disappoint.

Cue some brilliant Ray Harryhausen set pieces: Gwangi versus the Elephant! Gwangi versus the Styracosaurus! Gwangi rampages around a cathedral! The scene where the cowboys lasso the Gwangis neck multiple times deserves special mention too; it was a lengthy and tricky process for Ray Harryhausen, and meant exactly matching animated ropes to real ones. All in all, Gwangi is the real hero, the victim and the antagonist of the film. Not only do we sympathise with the Gwangi, we come away with the impression that although nature might be savage, we humans are the ones who are barbarous.

THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI is a very likable fantasy-western, full of nostalgic value for big kids who remember it and quite enjoyable for new audiences that are discovering it for the first time on this Blu-ray format. But it is a totally pleasant fare all the same and definitely a guilty pleasure from a bygone era. There are some fantasy, science fiction, and horror films that not every fan has seen. Not every film ever made has been seen by the audience that lives for such fare. Some of these deserve another look, and not every film should remain obscure, and that is why THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI should be a must view and to also enjoy the master of magic fantasy that is Ray Harryhausen. THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI is a very likable fantasy-western, evoking nostalgia for who remembers the film from their childhood and providing solid entertainment for new audiences who are discovering it for the first time. There are a few shortcomings but this is enjoyable fare nonetheless. THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI should have hit big when it came out; it is imaginative and exciting. However, the film flopped for two reasons, neither having anything to do with its quality. And even the films failure on its initial release had a positive effect: Ray Harryhausen and Charles H. Schneer re-grouped and came back six years later with possibly their greatest film, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. So despite this, it is best summed up as a total guilty pleasure from a bygone era!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection has brought us another classic film in their Blu-ray format in a stunning 1080p encoded solid image. It has been transferred in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio to really show off the Special Effects by wizard Ray Harryhausen film in the best way possible and it looks really fantastic and totally excellent with great Technicolor visual experience for a film that was released in 1969. There is also a beautiful grain reproduction effects that highlights this gorgeous Blu-ray disc presentation. But most important there is a generous amount of Technicolor saturate colours for the primaries; and the coating of the Gwangi skin is splendid with his reds, greens, and blues. Never too intense, and the Technicolor are very accurate for the flesh tones. But most importantly all the monsters look totally brilliant in this Ray Harryhausens special effects thrilling film in the brilliant Dynamation. There are not any visible signs of age-related wear and tear, so all in all this is an all-around terrific looking visual transfer and is another big win for another Warner Archive Collection Blu-ray disc release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Archive Collection has been only able to supply a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono because of the original soundtrack available when the film was released in 1969. It doesn't have any flaws and the effects carry some weight in the dinosaur and horses sound effects, especially the roars have that terrific guttural sound to them and really punch things up when the big bad Gwangi breaks loose and runs amok and there really isn't anything to complain about with this audio mix, especially for the age of the film, because it really holds up very well. Also very pleasant and enjoyable is the western original music score by Jerome Moross that really enhances the ambience enjoyment of the film to great effect and enjoyment.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Return To The Valley Documentary [2003] [480i] [1.37:1] [8:04] With this special retrospective feature we get Associate Producer/Creator of Special Effects wizard Ray Harryhausen discusses his animation of the Eohippus and Allosaurus in the film THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI [1969]. We find out that Charles Scheee [Producer] and Ray Harryhausen were on the lookout for a new project, and Ray found an in his garage an old script for the film THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI, which was the original script that Willis H. O'Brien [Visual Artist] had developed in 1942, and so Ray got hold of scriptwriter to bring the storyline up-to-date, but at the same time keeping in the time period of 1900, but Ray also informs us that the pivotal part of the scenario was the tiny Eohippus (Dawn Horse) featured in the film. Ray Harryhausen also informs us that when the cowboys lasso the Gwangi dinosaur, in reality the cowboys on the horses had a jeep between them with a pole sticking up so the cowboys had something to aim at with their ropes, then Ray Harryhausen had to meticulously match shot for shot with the animated model of the Gwangi dinosaur, that is why people today say that Ray Harryhausen was a total genius. With this extra bonus mini-feature, it features Ray Harryhausen, still hale and hearty at the age of 83 at the time of filming, talking about the film's conception and development. Joining him are several star struck young SFX professionals from Industrial Light + Magic, who they view him as the father of visual effects and appropriately reverent, as they discuss the inspiration that Ray Harryhausen and the Gwangi gave to them and to their work on the film Jurassic Park, and remain awestruck as they examine how to lasso an Allosaurus dinosaur, you really get to appreciate what genius work is on display here. Contributors include: Ray Harryhausen [Special Effects Creator], Danny Gordon Taylor [Animation Director for Industrial Light + Magic], Glen McIntosh [Lead Animator for Industrial Light + Magic], Ned Gorman [Visual Effects Producer for Industrial Light + Magic], Peter Daulton [Lead Animator for Industrial Light + Magic] and Tom Bertino [Animation Director for Industrial Light + Magic].

Special Feature: Gwangi and Vanessa [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:03] Here we have a little story about Rays wife Diana, daughter Vanessa, and certain dinosaur. This is a quick story about the time Ray Harryhausen's young daughter Vanessa who first saw the Gwangi model. Ray Harryhausen laughs at how his daughter Vanessa played with a Gwangi mock-up as she would with any other doll, and informs us that Diana and Vanessa were in Harrods Food Hall and two old fashioned women pensioners passers-by did not know what to expect when they would take a peek inside daughters baby pram, and were totally shocked what they saw, and indignantly told Diana that the child should have a proper doll, as Vanessa would grow up to be a delinquent. So as you can imagine Ray Harryhausen, Diana and Vanessa had a good laugh about the incident.

Theatrical Trailer [1969] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:44] Here we get to view the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI. This is a totally brilliant presentation and really gives you a flavour of what to expect when you view the actual film. On top of all that, the length of the trailer is more like a mini film that really holds your attention throughout the 2 minutes and 44 seconds running time.

Finally, unfortunately THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI was a massive box office flop, because it was deserted by its marketing team, because the American audiences were put off by the odd title, those who did go to see the film were treated to a sort of rehash of King Kong disguised as a Western. Despite such obstacles and especially with Ray Harryhausen's enduring appeal and especially the wonderful charm with which Ray Harryhausen always imbues with every one of his Dynamation films. THE VALLEY OF THE GWANGI found a place in the hearts of the many fans around the world of the wonderful Ray Harryhausen magic, and especially me and despite the negativity that this film received, I personally still love it and especially if you really think about it, every movement of these miniatures was miniscule, methodical and especially the dedication that Ray Harryhausen always put so much love into his films. The work was so maddeningly intricate, even as much as a telephone call could derail Ray Harryhausen. On some projects, the level of complexity permitted him to record just 14 frames in an entire day's work, that's barely half a second, in case you were wondering. So saddle up and join the excitement. Highly Recommended!

Better than it's ever looked, in spite of an occasional spot of dust. However, the coloration the dinosaur is still different in nearly every scene. Ray Harryhausen has said something went wrong in film developing, giving Gwangi an unintended blue cast; apparently they made him basic dino green. Actually though, blue is my favorite color. As a kid in 1969, a blue dino running around was about as much excitement I could take! But normally a film cleaned up & scanned for blu-ray would be color-stabilized, the way the do with projection jitter etc. I would have thought they'd have at least settled on the best shade of blue, and made it consistent throughout. Gwangi is a B-movie that probably couldn't justify a grade A overhaul, so I'm excited that it made it to blu-ray at all... still, room for improvement in a special collector's edition someday.",1492992000,7,1029,4.8192090395480225

Now this brand new transfer restoration blu ray is marvelous and very enjoyable as it renders for the first time all the glory of Gwangy in hd. Don't hesitate as you will enjoy all the action and adventure and every minute of it! The extras are cool too. Jerome Moross's soundtrack music is very inspired (i have the soundtrack cd compilation ""The classic film music by Jerome Moross"") and if i'm not mistaking, this was the first western movie ever including dinosaurs. There are lots of dinosaurs in here and for a rare occasion, the principal monster on the film (Gwangi) really steals the show. The scene with all cowboys trying to capture the tyronausorus is so well done and coordinated; up until the spectacular endind inside the cathedral in flames. The end scene with the powerful Gwangi themes music gave me  chills down the spine, while you see the reaction of the crowd but mostly the principal characters, watching the destruction of the cathedral and Gwangi, with a focus on the boy's sadness.

424944,3,6302101743,"The Valley of Gwangi,"" released in 1969, is a fantasy film featuring the stop motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen (Clash of the Titans, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms). At the turn of the 20th century, members of a struggling Wild West show traveling through rural Mexico come upon Forbidden Valley, a lost world containing survivors from the age of dinosaurs. There they capture a 14-foot carnivorous allosaurus in hopes of making it their shows star attraction. In a page from the King Kong playbook, the dinosaur breaks free of its bonds and goes on a destructive rampage.

Though the film itself is just so-so, it has some terrific sequences. The scene in which four cowboys lasso the dinosaur, named Gwangi (but never explained why), ranks with the best of Harryhausen. Theres also a neat scene in which Gwangi is confronted in a town square. Unfortunately, it takes nearly 45 minutes to get to the good stuff  Harryhausens sequences. The films build-up is sluggish and the acting wooden. James Franciscus is a dull leading man, Gila Golan is the token love interest, and sci-fi regular Richard Carlson is along for the ride.

The plot also involves gypsies and a curse, but are really marking time fillers until the dinosaur is revealed. The second half is much better and much more entertaining, thanks to Harryhausens artistry. The problem with this picture and so many of Harryhausens other movies, is that his creations are infinitely better than the stories in which they appear. Clearly, most of the production budget went to the animation rather than the human talent. If there were a stronger script, more scenes with the dinosaurs and less extraneous exposition, The Valley of Gwangi would be much improved.

Bonus extras on the widescreen Blu-ray release include the featurette Return to the Valley, in which an 83-year-old Ray Harryhausen discusses the movies conception and development, and a theatrical trailer.",1490745600,2,1934,5.053291536050157

424946,3,6302101743,"This review is for the Blu-Ray edition of 'The Valley of Gwangi' released in March, 2017 by Warner Archive Collection.

BLU-RAY: The blu-ray pictures is quite good. I basically have no complaints here.

EXTRA'S: There are a few extra's. Though nothing extraordinary or worth paying extra for.
The extra's are as follows:

Return to the Valley: This is an 8 minute interview with Ray Harryhausen where he talks about his special effects work.
There is a one minute tidbit about Harryhausen's daughter that should have been included in the above 'Return to the Valley.'
Trailer in standard definition.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Tuck (James Franciscus), a former stuntman, wants T.J. (Gila Golan) to sell her wild west show. The two are former lovers. T.J. comes into possession of a an Eohippus, a tiny horse, thought to be extinct. She thinks it will make her show far more successful and she doesn't want to sell out. Professor Bromley, a British paleontologist, wants both the horse and it's previous whereabouts known so that he can use them for scientific means. The professor plots with Lope, a boy, to try and kidnap the horse. His plot involves a superstitious gypsy lady who believes the Eohippus must be returned to it's original grounds or everyone will suffer the consequences. The gypsy and her mates kidnap the horse and the professor and Lope follow them to the hidden valley so that they now know the location. Meanwhile Tuck, T.J. and her crew follow along to recover the Eohippus. When they get to the valley, they discover it's hidden entrance. Once inside, they find quite a few dinosaurs (including an Allosaurus called Gwangi,) some of which are violent (included is a Styracosaurus, which is a plant eater, but it attacks anyway.) Lope is attacked and saved from a Pteranadon. There is much action involving the cowboys and dinosaurs from here on out. Eventually Gwangi knocks itself out pursuing the cowboys. They take him to the wild west show and plan to display him the same way King Kong was. The results are very similar.

PRODUCTION: This movie sprang from an idea of Willis O'Brien (special effects, King Kong.) O'Brien was never able to make the movie.  Harryhausen took the idea after O'Brien died in 1962 and finally brought it to life in 1969. The original script had Gwangi living in the Grand Canyon. The setting for this movie is Mexico.

Harryhausen notes in the documentary that Gwangi was conceived as a Tyrannosaurus Rex but was called an Allosaurus. This was due to the fact that Willis O'Brien did not really differentiate between the two and that the original script called for an Allosaurus.

There is a scene in which the Allosaurus catches an Orinthomimus which was obviously the inspiration for a similar scene in 'Jurassic Park.'

The acting is decent and stars James Franciscus, Gila Golan, Richard Carlson and Laurence Naismith.

The cover art was obviously made before the movie was filmed as everyone (including Gwangi) look quite different.

THOUGHTS:  I was never thrilled with the idea of Cowboys and Dinosaurs. For that matter I don't like sci-fi movies with Cowboys and anything. But that is my opinion. The sci-fi series 'Firefly' was excellent but it would have been so even without the western feel.

While all movies of this type have massive plot holes, I still like to point them out anyway. I feel that many of them are unnecessary.
The valley where Gwangi lives is almost completely barren and despite this, it has several dinosaurs living there that would need quite a bit of food to survive. A more lush setting would have been more appropriate. Also, they really should have showed more than 1 of each dinosaur. Afterall, how are they supposed to reproduce, even if they survived here for 60 million years.

Gwangi, himself....was quite bloodthirsty and hungry. Was there anything in the movie that it didn't kill or eat?...What an appetite! He just seemed to senselessly pursue and attack or kill everything it saw. There wouldn't be much left in that valley if it behaved like that all the time.
I didn't quite get what happened to the pteranodon. It picked up the boy and then had to come back to earth. Why didn't it take off after that rather lie around and be killed. Was it too tired to take off?

I felt the scene with the Allosaurus knocking itself out was rather weak. They couldn't come up with a better way to capture it? They had the idea of a pit but didn't use it except to capture the professor.

Overall, the cowboys were all rather inept. They basically failed at just about everything they did in the movie. They basically needed luck.
The ending in particular was very poor. There was almost nothing that could burn inside the church...yet it went up as if it were made of dried wood.

What were they thinking with that cage that they made to transport Gwangi? After tying it's mouth closed the untied it? Didn't they just watch him snap all of their ropes when they tried to lasso him? They tie a few loose ropes around him and transport him, conscious, in a flimsy cart.

This is not anywhere near my favorite Ray Harryhausen movie. It is just OK as far as I am concerned. He seemed more thrilled about it in the interview included in the extra's.

The movie takes awhile to get going. It's only after about half way through that we get to the dinosaurs for the first time. Up until then, we have a lame love story and a captured Eohippus.

The model used for Gwangi when he is unconscious does not look good at all. It is very stiff and wobbles.

RECOMMENDATION'S/CONCLUSION'S:  I give this release 4 stars for the picture, 2 1/2 stars for the extra's, 3 stars for the movie. Overall - 3 stars.
Recommended for fans of the movie who want the best picture available and for Ray Harryhausen fans. Also recommended for fans of dinosaur movies.",1490054400,2,5820,4.730237154150197

The live action and real backgrounds look a little soft when combined with the animated characters, but that's part of the process and not the result of a bad transfer. The animated characters are mostly sharp and detailed. I personally love old school effects and prefer them to the special effects of today.

424998,4,6302101743,"Let's get this right: the movie is ""The Valley of Gwangi"" not the Gwangi as it is listed here and there. At least the IMDb gets it right. Gwangi is the proper name of the allosaurus, probably given by the mysterious band of Romany gypsies who seem to have lost their way in Transylvania and ended up in Mexico. If a Gwangi was a generic name like crocodile, you could say Valley of the Crocodile and be OK, but not with Gwangi. Don't know why that extra ""the"" bugs me, but it does.

This would be a forgotten late 60's adventure film released midsummer for kids if it wasn't for the Ray Harryhausen dinosaurs and other effects. That puts it in a special class. It may not be Clash of the Titans, Jason and the Argonauts or any of the three Sinbad movies but it's still Harryhausen, and late Harryhausen at that with really smoothly moving stop motion well-integrated into the live action. Just the capture of Gwangi with lassos took five months to film. Beyond that, the cast, led by James Franciscus and Gila Golan play their roles with commitment beyond what you'd expect in a 60's film of this type. Everyone seems to be having fun in the film and it moves along quickly. Warner Brothers gave it good sound and distinguished film composer Jerome Moross (The Big Country) wrote the score.

The plot is sort of a ""Lost World"" type adventure, except instead of an island it's a valley in Mexico cut off from everything else by tall. sheer mountains. The local gypsies call it the Forbidden Valley and tell everyone not to go there or be cursed, but once an Eohippus (a small prehistoric horse) is found and brought back to T.J. Breckinridge's (Gila Golan) travelling rodeo & circus, the race is on to see what else is there. There's an old failed romance between T.J. and Tuck (James Franciscus) that you know is going to be rekindled, a kindly British professor (Lawrence Naismith) to explain things and a cute kid (Curtis Arden) for the kids in the audience to identify with. There's a bunch of cowboys, too, with names like Rowdy and Bean, and lots of extras to run around when Gwangi inevitably escapes. What's not to like? This is popcorn cinema at its very best.

Of course the effects aren't anything like up to the moment CGI, so just remember that this was stste of the art effects in 1969. To be honest I don't remember Gwangi being quite as iridescent as he appears here, and it makes him look more unreal than I recall, but it's been a long time. This was planned long before as the follow up to King Kong, but was never made. Harryhausen had a copy of the old script and after the big success of One Million B.C. (which introduced Raquel Welch to the world) he was able to generate studio interest.

This is a great blast from the past and if you like this sort of thing it's worth seeing.",1465516800,34,2802,4.456140350877193

Gia Golan is very good looking , but her voice is dubbed so she does not have a foreign accent.  They should not have dubbed her voice.  James Fransicus  was miscast but was popular at the time.

There is a great deal of fun to be had in this film a remnant of a world where while really unlikely such a thing might just be possible.

The Jerome Moross score elevates this film from being just another standard fantasy motion picture and transforms it into a Western dinosaur roundup. The setting enhanced by the score and Harryhausen's convincing stop motion creatures really dupes the viewer very subtly into thinking that this Western could have happened. Or almost! The actual valley when first seen by the cowboys has a very unsettling look about it, somewhere between prehistoric and surrealistic. The Jerome Moross score is very reminiscent of his ""THE BIG COUNTRY,"" ""THE PROUD REBEL"" and ""THE JAYHAWKERS."" The dinosaur work here by Harryhausen ranks among his best.

The problem is, for such a tiny animal,he manages to bring a huge bag of trouble for his owner, Miss TJ Breckenridge. Enter Tuck Kirby, a man who seeks a fast buck, and TJ's interest seeking to buy the horse she has in her featured act. The other man in her life, Carlos, is jealous and quietly seething at Kirby's return and the fact that he has walked in so smoothly. In the meantime,Kirby sees the little horse, but doesn't realize its significance until his young guide and friend little Lopez leads him to make the acquaintance of Professor Bromley. Throughout this Tia Zorina,an old blind Gypsy woman comes upon them at times threatening them that Gwangi's curse hangs over all of them unless they release the little horse back from where they got him. When they refuse, she takes matters into her own hands and with the sly professor's help, she has the gypsy band kidnap the little horse.
In the chase to get him back, the circus hands discover the Forbidden Valley and one surprise after another, none of them really good. When they try to capture an Ornithomimus, they discover the true beast of the valley, an Allosaurus. Several attempts to catch it fail and Carlos is killed as they try to flee from it. It manages to knock itself unconscious in a rockfall and they finally cage it to bring it into town. When the old Gypsy appears again, she repeats her curse and during the opening act, she again takes matters into her own hands once more, this time to truly disastrous results as the freed creature goes on a rampage through the town. This was a rather unusual movie with a western theme and HarryHausen's effects were never better, especially in the fight with the elephant and earlier, the Styracosaurus back in the valley. This is one of his best, a true classic, along with ""Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"", ""Clash of the Titans"" and many others that brought viewing pleasure both in the theatre and at home on Movie Monster nights.

425223,4,6302101743,"Half of this movie is a brilliant rip-off of other Ray Harryhausen films (it's perfectly all right to copy from oneself).  The other half of this movie is a western of sorts, another treatise on greed.  Most of the characters are scheming to get rich, get the girl, get the Eohippus.  The rest of the characters are working to sabotage everyone else's scheme; in the end, all motives are suspect (especially that of an old gypsy woman no one takes seriously............""DOOM!"").
The first part of this movie acts as filler until we get to the good stuff, when they actually go into the valley of Gwangi.  When the Pteranodon shows up it only heralds more wonders to come: an Omithomimus, the fabulous Allosaurus, and of course the persistent Styracosaurus.  Naturally, they have to capture the Allosaurus (Gwangi) and bring the souvenir back to civilization, where, for a price, you can take part in a stampede.  The final battle sequence is spectacular.  On the whole, not a bad effort.  The acting is par for the course; it didn't make or break anyone's career.

425229,4,6302101743,"Ah, ""The Valley of Gwangi"";  Ray Harryhausen's final foray into the world of the dinosaurs.  Well, he sure goes out with a bang.  While it's my opinion that ""Gwangi"" isn't a particularly GREAT film, it's certainly worth watching if only for Harryhausen's fantastic stop-motion effects and a novel premise.  The human characters are a bit of a bore, with the writing relying on too many clich plot tropes.  The overarching plot itself is little more than a retread of ""King Kong"" with western elements and without the central beast's fascination with blondes.  However, the enjoyable special effects and absolutely thrillng musical score by Jerome Moross more than make up for the film's drawbacks.  The best and most memorable sequence in the movie is when the cowboys begin roping Gwangi, the titular Allosaurus, as if he is cattle.  The film isn't a classic in the normal sense of the word, given that it is less than perfect (no one remembers this film for anything besides the special effects, after all), but it IS a great example of vintage dinosaur filmmaking.  All of this said, I still think it's a GOOD film at the very least.

As for the DVD, the Warner Archive Collection version is the exact same disc as the 2003 release.  For those of you that are unfamiliar with that release, it features a decent widescreen transfer with a few extras.  Personally, I was a little worried when I ordered my copy; given Warner Archive's low budget origins it seemed like the disc might just feature a bare menu and play option, as most of their discs do.  I need not have worried, for as stated this is simply a reissue of the 2003 DVD under the Warner Archive banner.  It features the same menus, extras, widescreen presentation and audio options that the original release did (including the short featurette ""Return to the Valley"").  The only difference is in the packaging: the cover art has been updated to reflect the fact that this version is produced by Warner Archive and the disc comes in a plastic keepcase as opposed to the terrible cardboard snapcases that Warner used to issue all of its releases in.  The disc itself has slightly updated art as well and is printed on a DVD-R as opposed to the discs used for premiere releases.  So, fear not, potential buyers.  If you're looking to acquire a copy of this film, this version is the way to go.  The original release is long out of print and the prices as of this writing are ridiculous.  You will only be paying more for an older version of the same thing.  Unless you just can't bear the thought of having anything but an original copy, save your money and get this release instead.",1345852800,6,2645,4.657327586206897
425230,5,6302101743,"Anyone who is fond of Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animation (also called ""Dynamation"") will obviously enjoy this flick for the very fine but typical  special effects.

Although this is a ""Cowboys Meet the Dinosaurs"" flick - which is a novel idea, it follows pretty much the plots of earlier ""captured giant monster"" movies, most notably ""King Kong"" and ""20 Million Miles to Earth"".

However, this one is a bit more entertaining because there is a backstory about a struggling Wild West show. Perhaps it is struggling because it's taking place IN the Wild West, or almost, if Mexico counts. They'd probably draw a better crowd back east in New York!

It is through accident that the cowboys running the show discover the dinos in the ""Forbidden Valley"". (Didn't that become the name of a salad dressing?) There, they meet Gwangi (the star of the movie) whom they hope will save the show - or eat it - whichever comes first.

It is in this backstory that we get to meet some interesting and charming characters, and this is what makes the movie for me.

We have good main characters - Tuck (played by James Franciscus who does a very nice job as hero), T.J. (played by Gila Golan) the show's owner, main attraction and Tuck's love interest, Champ (played by an aging Richard Carlson who doesn't really have that much to do), Professor Bromley (played by Laurence Naismith with a British accent) and Lope, the enterprising Mexican boy, played by Curtis Arden.

Since the dinos are very predictable in their look and behavior, it is the backstory and acting that carries the film.

Franciscus is cast as a kind of lover boy/hunk. Yes, they get his shirt off in one scene and we get to see Gila Golan change clothes behind a screen in another. We also get to see them kiss, but only after explaining they want to marry, have kids, and start a ranch. This is a G-rated film, after all!

Franciscus carries off the role pretty well, but where he shines is in his scenes with Lope, the Mexican boy. He never talks down to the kid or treats him as an ""extra"" (as often happens in movies of this type that have a kid - See ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"") and shows genuine concern for the kid's safety. He also is believable as a semi-rogue in his affections for TJ, his love interest. Theirs is an on-again, off-again relationship, with both succumbing to the allure of fame and fortune over their mutual affection. He plays well with the Professor, acting the foil while the Professor explains the more complex concepts of paleontology so we as audience can believe in Wild West Dinos.

TJ really could be more developed (as a character, not physically, she is very well developed along those lines). She lacks the toughness of a hard headed business woman and show owner. But, her vulnerability (and naivete) make her a good foil for Tuck. If she had been a stronger character, their relationship would have carried more interest.

The Professor is convincing as an opportunistic scientist, but he's never an evil scientist, just one whose scruples can be ""adjusted"" to meet his goals. The Professor also provides a bit of comic relief. What is missing from his character is that he does not act as the voice of science, reason or compassion for the dinos and their treatment. The script isn't that advanced (we don't see this type of intelligent behavior until Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neil show up in ""Jurassic Park""). Nevertheless, he is a fun character to watch.

Sadly, Champ (Richard Carlson, the veteran of sci-fi flicks), has little to do in the movie other than act as a father figure to TJ, although at times it seems he may have a love interest in her as well, even if it is only platonic.

They say if you want a hit, stick in a kid or a puppy, or better yet both. We don't get a puppy here (does a cute little tiny horse count?), but Curtis Arden as Lope, the enterprising Mexican boy does deliver the charm.

Of the animated characters, Gwangi is by far the most alluring, if voracious. For some reason, most Hollywood dinos and similar giant monsters seem to have a different way of behaving than we would expect in the natural world. Gwangi is no different.

We are supposed to believe he is an Allosaurus, a prehistoric predator. Obviously, Gwangi is hungry and in search of food. However, when he grabs and kills a smaller dinosaur (poor thing - the screaming is not pleasant to hear), he only takes a few bites and is then off to chase the smaller but far more interesting cowboys (it's the equivalent of taking a bite of a steak dinner, then chasing down a bowl of popcorn). Realistically, one might think the creature would ignore them and drag his meal off to eat it completely. But then it would be HOURS before we get a dino-chases-cowboys scene!

While this movie is pale by comparison in violence to modern dino flicks (of the Jurassic Park type), it is none the less disturbing at times. This is thanks to the sound effects more than the action.

There is only a minimum amount of blood and carnage shown, which one would expect from a movie of the late 1960's. However, there is one scene that is supposed to be a shocker, but comes across as almost amusing in spite of its violence.

Gwangi is revealed to the public, chewing on a dwarf! Although this is meant to be shocking, and it certainly is memorable, it's so expected and over-the-top that it just made me laugh. The amusement isn't helped by Champ's (Richard Carlson) look of shocked dismay and his command to his boys, ""Hurry, get the curtain down!""

The real violence in this movie is aural. There is plenty of agonized screaming from creatures and humans alike in the killing scenes. It shows what a good sound crew can add to a film without falling back on gore and red dye glop gross out effects or ominous music blasts from the orchestra.

Of course, in the end of the movie, Gwangi must be eliminated since the scientist has failed to argue a reasonable treatment of this remarkable and unique creature. We can't have Gwangi running around loose for obvious reasons, so he must die in a convenient, if accidental fire.

Here the film falls back on the older favorites, ""King Kong"" and ""20 Million Miles to Earth"", but with Gwangi screaming and suffering a horrible death in the burning building.

There is a sense of pity for the poor dino, who was only minding his own business eating other dinos before the meddlesome cowboys captured him. There is a blatant sense of unfairness here, made more poignant by the look on the actor's faces (Franciscus, Golen, Arden) as they hear the sounds of the dying creature.

The films ends here leaving some questions.

Who is going to pay for all the damage to the Town?
Will the scientist launch a new expedition to ""Forbidden Valley"" (in search of salad or dinos, whatever).
Will Tuck and TJ ever get married, or will they wind up in jail for all the havoc caused by their capture and mishandling of Gwangi?
What are they going to do with a giant rotting dinosaur carcass?

Okay, I am thinking WAY too much for this film.

Films of this style aren't big on logic or reason, they are meant to thrill and entertain the audience without requiring too much thought. In this respect, the film stands up to its contemporaries. However, it is a bit disappointing because the script has a good backstory and characters, and with a little more effort (or perhaps courage) on the part of the studio and writers it could have been a pioneering film, even one with a message.

Instead, it succumbs to the formula method and fails its potential. Nevertheless, it is a fun film, a bit above the others of its kind, with fun performances by the actors.",1340409600,,7655,4.593108504398827

425247,4,6302101743,"First Impressions:

James Franciscus, better known for his TV shows (Hunter, FBI, Longstreet, etc.) is the hero is this great cowboy/dinosaur adventure!  The film starts out as a Western, with a standard Western town ""south of the Rio Grande"" as well follow the trail of a con artist (Franciscus), the girl he dumped and trying to patch that up, an absent minded professor and other stock characters, including Mexican gypsies.  The gypsies are funny in that they are dressed like Hungarians but speak Spanish.

The romance betwee nJames' character and the girl was a bit tepid.  More annoying was the lipsynch voice dubbing of the woman actor Gila Golan, who (per wiki) had such a heavy Israeli accent that they had to cover it up.

Of the course the star of the show is Harryhausen's special effects.  The DVD has a special where Ray is interviewed about his technique, while young guys from Industrial Light & Magic gush about Ray's contribution to special effects in movies.  I found especially interesting that it was stated many scenes from Jurassic Park were inspired from Valley of the Gwangi!

Weird Western Tale!

The later part of the film is the most exciting, as the cowboys attempt to lasso the dinosaur.  Ray Harryhausen explained in one of the features how they used a wire and a pole to wrap the ropes around, then did some film magic to make it all blend in.

Technically it's amazing and seamless animation.  But it also makes for an interesting story.  The fights with a triceratops and a large circus elephant were fun to watch as well.

The story's ending is sad for the dinosaur as well as a few bloody scenes of humans becoming snacks.  A boy's tear-streaked face tell us why the audience does not cheer for the downfall of Gwangi.

A plot hole or two:  What happened to the gypsies who actually helped Gwangi escape in the first place?  And is the hole to the Forbidden Valley fully covered?  We may never know.

Bottom Line:

Recommended especially for Harryhausen fans.",1306281600,,1996,4.72463768115942

425252,4,6302101743,"Here's a case where the poster or box-cover just about tells you all you need to know. In circa 1900 Mexico, a group of American and Mexican rodeo riders, bullfighters, and cowhands enter a forbidden valley and find a lost world of dinosaurs, ""dawn horses"", pterodactyls, etc. Pretty much enough to get you interested - or not - right there I would think. No? Well, I guess a little more detail wouldn't hurt.

Basically James Franciscus, fresh off of success in a supporting role in PLANET OF THE APES from the previous year, tries to parlay that into a lead as Tuck, the charming rogue type - the proto-Indiana Jones if you will - who has loved and left T.J., (Israeli actress Gina Golan, dubbed here because her accent was considered too strong), a stunt horseback rider - gets involved with her again when she shows him a tiny horse that she wants to make her new act. Her new partner Carlos (Gustavo Rojo) doesn't much like Tuck, setting up a romantic rivalry that never really goes anywhere. Also there's an archaeologist, Bromley (Laurence Naismith, just the guy for this kind of role, old and veddy veddy British), and a charming kid (Curtis Arden), and a few others. The first 2/5 of the film is really just set-up, pitting the various characters against each other as they vie for the mini-horse - nicely animated by Ray Harryhausen, the real reason to see the film. There's also a blind old Indian seer-woman who warns that the valley is death and of course this proves to be true for one unfortunate member of the party later on.

Eventually everybody gets together, quarrels are basically forgotten (too conveniently really) and they head into the valley, where they don't find any more little horsies, but do stumble on a big bipedal dino - close to an Allosaurus in size (5 meters high or so) but looking more like a T-Rex - a pterodactyl, and some other extinct reptilian beasties. They spend a bit over half an hour trying to get out, barely thinking about specimens for science or sideshow monsters for profit, but as they unwittingly trap the Allo on their escape, dollar signs appear again, and the film shifts into King Kong mode (minus the emotional content). The Allo, now called Gwangi, is to be set up as the prime exhibit in a travelling show that will make them all rich - but the Indian seer has been following their progress, and she has other ideas. Gwangi's arrival in the big time doesn't go as planned, as you might guess without my having to tell you.

The acting isn't any great shakes here, and the narrative is fairly rudimentary and uninspired for the most part, but really who cares? There's a wonderful Jerome Moross score that is reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein as well as some of Moross' own early work - it's very much a typical rousing western score of the 60s but really nicely done and with a terrific main theme. There's nice cinematography by Erwin Hillier, right at the end of a distinguished career that included other action and adventure films like SANDS OF THE KALAHARI; and most of all there's the great FX work by Harryhausen, whose work is up to its usual standard. The pterodactyl carrying the boy is about as realistic as any flying stop-motion work from that era I've seen, and the climactic sequence with Gwangi in the ring, the town and finally the awesome finale in the cathedral is really marvellous work, and O'Connolly's direction rises to meet the challenge at this point also. This is definitely one of those films with an ending that adds some points to the work as a whole, reminiscent of course of KING KONG but also Harryhausen's earlier 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH.

All in all it's a terrific bit of fluff; I would have liked the ""cowboy"" angle to be played up a bit more, but no matter really, it's the monsters that we're here for.",1282348800,,3803,4.612998522895126

This is underscored at the end, when, as in ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"", the titular monster exits in a death struggle amongst flaming wreckage. Gwangi dies in a burning Catholic cathedral, and the human characters show sympathetic emotion for the suffering creature. It's clear that Harryhausen had a real sympathy for the passing of the Age of Reptiles, and managed to communicate it to the script writers and production crews he worked with.

I knew the claymation dinosaurs would be fantastic, but I wasn't sure about the storyline. I expected it to be terrible and not even worth a laugh, but it had more substance than I had thought.

425261,4,6302101743,"As this review begins, one must pose a question of sorts to the mass audiences.  If ""The Valley of Gwangi"" were a travel destination, say like a classic visit to Dinosaur Land, would modern audience want to go, or would the glitz and glamour of the Jurassic attraction in the neighboring city drown the excitement.  Could a mom-and-pop destination, complete with an Allosaurus created by the maestro himself, Ray Harryhausen, still appeal to a generation transfixed on iPods, CGI, MySpace, and boy-band ring tones?  Is the destination worth the trip?  Below is compiled a review of sorts on why ""The Valley of Gwangi"" would be an excellent place to spend your summer, complete with a restaurant guide, a locals favorite section, and the much needed, ""Watch Your Step"" section (aka the pitfalls to avoid).  This is a guide to hopefully help the amateur Harryhausen traveler, as well as the most experienced.  ""The Valley of Gwangi"" is a strange, yet wonderful trip that should be continually experienced (despite the bizarre ending), and hopefully never forgotten.

For a trip to ""The Valley of Gwangi"", you want to pack light.  There will be quite a bit of running, horseback riding, church destruction, and trap making, so you definitely do not want to be weighted down with a burdening weight.  This guide suggests just finding what you need when you arrive, one could even approach the vast traveler himself, Tuck Kirby, straight from another death defying trip filled with cons, hassles, and barters.  He is your ""need-to-get"" guy.  On this trip, he is hunting for a horse, preferably one that his old flame, a lady named T.J., currently uses in one of the greatest sideshow attractions you are going to find on your trip.  With little to carry and a guide by your side, you may want to avoid such pitfalls as asking young children name Lope for help.  This is an obvious swindle, as he claims he needs to feed his family - while continually paying for further information.  Let's not even discuss the crazed gypsy with an eye-patch coupled with her small guide.  That is our competitor; you don't want to travel with them.  Trust me.  It is these socialites that you meet on this trip that will provide you with at least an hour and a half of entertainment. One can even be guaranteed the clich shout ""By George!"" from our resident archeologist which is a constant source of laughter and amusement.  They may seem overplayed, wooden, and at times not quite as frightened as they should be that they are standing in front of a Triceratops, but they are good companions, and worthy of the special effects that will soon engulf you.

Did I say ""engulf"", oops, I mean to say devour you!  Is anyone else hungry?  Looking for that perfect spot in the Valley where you can enjoy a sit down meal.  Well, count that out.  Here, it is survival of the fittest - literally.  When this guide went to tour the local eateries, we used the Gwangi as our guide.  He showed us how to properly eat Triceratops, elephants, jealous boyfriends, and anything else that was in the way.  To be honest, our Gwangi is an eating machine, but thanks to the brilliant animation by Harryhousen, it is worth the poor service.  Harryhousen may fall short on the small detail (some quote the lack of shadows), but it is the overall effect that makes you want to visit again and again.  The creatures he creates, while they are as colorful as a bowl of Lucky Charms, are realistic, coupled with honest reactions that put you there with the creatures.  The scene that stands out is one where our guides are trying to tie the neck of a Gwangi to keep him secure.  The beast screams, tugs, grabs at the real ropes in a way that real animation may have cheapened out.  Take these scenes of realism, our pesky - non-traumatized guides, and the detail of blood on the Gwangi's victims, and this film steps up another notch that a regular viewer may never see coming.  The detail during our fights, one could credit Harryhausen again, are superb.  While the colors seem to be a bit over the top, the attacks placed are not without scars.  This could make the average tourist see the danger and the madness in our team's unheroic ways to become the best sideshow in the Valley, and the true threat that lies within them.

Finally, the ""Watch Your Step"" section.  With very little to fill this section, it is necessary because not everyone traveling will want to see the Gwangi due to what modern technologies are currently available.  All this guide can say is beware of these short pitfalls.  1) The ending.  Without ruining your entire trip, I must say that the last twenty minutes revealed a much different tone that the first 90 minutes of this journey.  With our iconic final scene, I felt our mayor of this town, Jim O' Connolly, captured the ideas of cowboys and dinosaurs fighting together, in fact it was the fight sequences that kept me glued to the screen, but there were two separate films in this one little B-movie.  There was the greed, the corruption, and the voice of our carnival people as they hunted for the main attraction, but then there was the counter-point to their greed.  There was the destruction - and that carried with it a new world that didn't mesh as well with the first.  Another ""pitfall"" to this trip, may be our locals (as they are also a plus), but their lack of concern when fatal errors occur to one of their own, their lack of true fear, and the clich stereotypes that follow our bumbling archeologist are fun, but not for honest cinema.  Outside of these two minor drawbacks, the Gwangi will satisfy every urge you have to ensure safe passage through the Cape of Monster Cinema.

Overall, I must admit, this film surprised me more than anticipated.  Having grown up with the Jurassic option always in plain sight, it was a pleasure to finally allow this film to breathe.  One can only hope others decide to pick up this journey and enjoy the sights, sounds, destroyed religious centers, and Allosaurus vs. Elephant fights.  A bit of warning if there needs to be, this is B-rated, this is not high quality cinema if you nitpick acting and technical civility, but when traveling in the rural south -- who needs that sort of high-tech honesty?  Ray Harryhausen influenced our current generation of film with such films as ""Valley of Gwangi"", and it shouldn't be forgotten.  I applaud this film for what it accomplished, and promise - even with the nimble ending - that if you choose to embark on an adventure like this - remember my first word of advise - pack light ... you are in for a strange and fantastic voyage!

Grade: **** out of *****",1223510400,,6644,4.650385604113111
425272,5,6302101743,"The sound and image quality of the film are excellent.  Only at a couple of points does the image have a slightly dirty or deteriorated appearance.  The light balance is excellent throughout.  The character development is nice, and at least as good as those found in the Indiana Jones movies.  The confident, strong willed woman (T.J.), the operator of a Wild West Show, works well in this movie.  My complaints are only slight.  The stop-action of the tiny horse looks a little phony.  This technique works better with imaginary creatures than with real animals.  Also, Gwangi is somewhat violet in color.  I would have preferred the more traditional dinosaur color of green or brown.  Another complaint is the sour ending.  If I had my way, I would have written a happier ending, for example, by disclosing the discovery of Gwangi's eggs with babies hatching out, where the baby dinosaurs are recruited for use in the Wild West Show.  But we are stuck with the sour ending.  If you don't want to learn the plot, you need to stop reading at this point.

The film opens with a bleak landscape resembling Death Valley.  We see eight gypsies in a valley searching for a companion.  The companion, a man with a bag, is shown stumbling down a gulch.  He clutches a bag.  Something alive is inside, something making neighing sounds.  But an old blind woman (a witch), one of the gypsies, issues a warning, ""No, no.  Leave it I tell you.  If he does not go back to the Forbidden Valley, we will all suffer a terrible fate.  Fool!  Ah.  One day he will learn to obey the Law of the Gwangi.""

A few minutes of credits are then shown.

The story begins with a Wild West Show marching into a Mexican town.  A cowboy atop a moving stagecoach twirls a lasso, followed by a cluster of running Mexican boys.  Then, a cute Mexican boy (Lope) materializes and offers to do odd jobs for Tuck Kirby, a former associate of the Wild West Show.  We see the actual Wild West Show.  Indians chase a stagecoach around and around the arena.  The stagecoach is set afire, and it leaves by way of a gate.  There are faux gun fights and faux fist fights.  The stunts are excellent.

The next act introduces us to Miss T.J. Breckenridge (""T.J.""), a beautiful woman, who does tricks on a horse.  We see her atop a horse, about to dive off a platform into a pool of water, where the rim of the pool is ringed with flames.  The horse dives from the platform--a trick identical to that performed, at one time, at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  But the crowd in the arena is sparse.

Tuck Kirby makes another appearance.  T.J. does not welcome him at first.  T.J. throws him out saying, ""You stick to your con tricks and I'll stick to my horse tricks.""  Lope is friends with a professor, an American paleontologist.  The old professor adds science to this science fiction film.  At turning point then occurs.  We see the arena being used for rehearsing a bull fight.  A matadore practices in the ring, but Lope fools around in the ring with a blanket.  A bull begins to attack.  Tuck Kirby dashes into the ring and saves the boy.  Then T.J. falls back in love with Tuck.  Another man (Carlos) saves Tuck from the bull.

In the next scene, we finally see the tiny horse, the one contained in the cloth sack at the start of the movie.  This occurs 25 minutes into the movie.  ""What are you doing here, over 50 million years after you should have been extinct,"" exclaims the professor.  T.J.'s goal is to use the tiny horse as an act in the Wild West Show, to bring in more customers.

But at night, the dwarf, the blind witch, and their gypsy friends, steal the tiny horse, and deliver it back to the Forbidden Valley and set it free.  While stealing the tiny horse, the dwarf conks Carlos on the head.  But Lupe with the professor, and separately Tuck Kirby, follow the gypsies to the Forbidden Valley.  Finally, 40 minutes into the film, the gypsies let the tiny horse free, saying, ""Fly little one.""

Within a few minutes, T.J., Tuck, Lope, and the professor have re-captured the tiny horse, but it escapes and leads them through a tunnel to a second valley.  The second valley resembles Elephant Hill, a part of Canyonlands National Park.  Now, fortyfive minutes into the film, there is a scene with a pterodactyl.  The bird carries Lupe off, but he is saved a few minutes later.  Then, a tiny dinosaur appears, and shortly thereafter, Gwangi materializes and eats the tiny dinosaur.  Then, 50 minutes into the film, a triceratops appears.

Comedy makes its appearance.  One of the group observes that the bullets that they had been shooting at the dinosaurs were only blanks, used in the Wild West Show.  The men dig a deep hole and cover it with pine branches.  Something gets caught in the trap, but it is only the professor.

From the 60 minute to 75 minute time point (15 min altogether), there is a generous lassoing scene.  At one point, three cowboys on three horses have simultaneously thrown three lassos around Gwangi's neck.  After this scene, Gwangi is wheeled into town on a large cart.  But in lumbering along a desert road, they encounter the witch and the dwarf.  The witch warns them, ""Soon you will be doomed, all of you, unless the evil one is set free.""

Within a few minutes, we are back at the arena.  This time the arena is packed with thousands of Mexicans, many with sombreros.  But we see the witch instructing the dwarf to set Gwangi free.  The dwarf sneaks under Gwangi's red tent and unlocks the gate to the cage.  At this point, an elephant act draws to a conclusion.  Then Gwangi escapes, with the Mexican dwarf in his mouth.  Gwangi fights the elephant, and in the mean time, there is a massive mob scene, as thousands of Mexicans dash from the arena, upsetting fruit carts.  The scene is reminiscent of the theater mob scene from THE BLOB with Steve McQueen.  Part of the mob runs into a cathedral.  At one point, an escaping person falls and rolls down the cathedral steps.  But at 90 minutes, Gwangi enters the cathedral.  A torch is overturned, and the entire cathedral, along with Gwangi, goes up in flames.  The film ends at 95 minutes.",1198886400,3,6158,4.536918869644485

The meanest of these prehistoric nasties is a big purple T-Rex. He's related to Barney, perhaps; I haven't seen that many other purple dinosaurs... But this is no Barney... He's a mean motorscooter and it's just amazing seeing this Rex battle cowboys and one scene in particular that's very, very nice is when the cowboys actually pull off lassoing this big purple brute, sticking him in a cage, and bringing him back ""home"".

I've gotta criticize some things though...  The script was only occassionally inspired.  The lighting was too often too dark.  why do that to our straining eyes, Mr. Director?  no need for the dusk scenes!  Many potentially interesting personality clashes, but those conflicts never seemed to impress me...  ho-hum...  and some scenes were just too long, without enough going on.

The late scene clips of all of the sombraro-covered masses fleeing the stadium reminded me of the comic spoof-scene in Monty Python And The Holy Grail where that castle guard sees a guy perpetually running toward him.  Gosh, the last of those Mexican locals (and Mexico City it ain't) were forever still cramming into the exit tunnels.  unintented laughs!

If you love seeing Marlboro guys whipping around on horses (over and over again), you'll go ga-ga over this late 60s entry.

and, sorry, but I have to critique the ending.  Out of the blue, the long last scene seems to be some sort of commentary on Roman Catholicism.  We see the protagonist-Rex big-butt his way into a bigger-on-the-inside-than-on-the-outside cathedral (so big and ornate it would make V-City drool).  As the masses rush in the front door and all instinctively rush out the back (I kid you not), the evil Rex gets locked in, and then gets burned to death, in a fire that burns the entire cathedral to the ground, though the attached building on either side remain unscathed.  and everyone stares in awe and disbelief.  um..... ok.... meaning?  not sure how to end a cowboy/dinosaur movie?  trying to give James Fran a way to not die in the end, as he did in Beneath The Planet Of The Apes?  is the ""message"" that these Catholicized Mexicans would be better off getting out of their church because evil resides in there, and is bound for the fires of hell???  if that isn't close to the message, then what was the point?  no point?

Wth a little re-writing, this film came into being.  I remember seeing this film as a kid.  Personally, I think it's still as good now as it was then.  Ray Harryhausen's special effects are, as always, first-rate.  The story is both interesting and exciting, contains barely a dull moment.  Scenes of the cowboys riding into the forbidden valley, the little horse in its miniature stable, and the roping of the titular allosaur had stuck in my mind since I first saw this film.  Combining a western with a dinosaur movie was certainly a master-stroke.  The human characters are interesting, as are the dinosaurs - you really do feel sympathy for Gwangi at the finale.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the backgrounds are atmospheric and dramatic.  Besides this film, now looking better than ever, this DVD also contains an interesting look at the making of Gwangi, including interviews with Ray Harryhausen himself.

425293,4,6302101743,"The Valley of Gwangi, aka Gwangi, aka The Lost Valley, aka The Valley Time Forgot, aka The Valley Where Time Stood Still, (whew!) stars James Franciscus (Beneath the Planet of the Apes) and Richard Carlson (It Came From Outer Space) and while they were decent, the real star of this movie is special effects creator and legend Ray Harryhausen.  Franciscus plays Tuck Kirby, a cowboy looking to make a quick buck by brokering a deal for the sale of a horse that's being used in his ex-girlfriend's Wild West circus show that is located 'just south of the Rio Grande'.  Gila Golan plays T.J. Breckenridge, owner of the circus, with Carlson as Champ Connors, the protective fatherly figure/manager of the circus.

Anyway, a discovery is made of some sort of prehistoric animal, a wee little horse, and we soon find out the animal came from an area called the 'forbidden valley'...or at least that's what it is called by the gypsy-like tribe that seems to live near it, which, by the way, are inclined to believe that the rather wee horse needs to be returned to the valley whence it came of dire consequences involving a curse or some such hooey will follow.  Now, getting off on a slight tangent, if I were these gypsies and I wanted to keep people out of the valley, I would have probably called it something else, like valley of the happy flowers, or valley of the nothing to see here, as the forbidden valley just sounds too tempting to strangers and such to not be explored. The gypsies also refer to it at times as the valley of the Gwangi, but they never really get specific as to the exact nature of the Gwangi.  So these gypsies end up stealing the wee, small horse and returning it to the 'forbidden' valley, with members of the Wild West circus in hot pursuit.  Also along for the ride is some elderly anthropologist who happens to be in the area studying fossils and various junk who seems to just get in the way more than anything else.  This pursuit ultimately leads the group into the forbidden valley, where they encounter various prehistoric creatures, including a voracious and persistent tyrannosaurus rex.  We are now about an hour into the movie, so if it's dinosaurs ye be looking for, keep this in mind, as you will probably be bored silly with the movie leading up to this point.  Cowboys and dinosaurs?  Sounds pretty cool...and it is.  Harryhausen really outdid himself in this movie not only bringing these various creatures to life, but managing to instill personality into them, and adding all kinds of nuances to the stop motion animation.  Keep in mind there were no high tech hoity toity computer gizmatronics back when this movie was made, so special effects creators had to be, well, creative.  Harryhausen, shows in this film why he's considered one of the greatest effects artists in motion pictures.  The man must have truly loved his work as it shows here.  So what happens next?  Well, the cowboys manage to capture one of the bigger, wily, creatures (hint, it's a real big one with sharp, pointy teeth) and bring it back to put in the Wild West show but things go badly as the creature escapes and wreaks havoc in a heavily populated area.  Think of Godzilla attacking Tokyo except instead of Godzilla it's a prehistoric beast, instead of Tokyo it's Mexico City and instead of frightened Japanese people fleeing in terror, it's frightened Mexican people in sombreros fleeing in terror.  Oh the carnage...who lives?  Who dies?  Who get horribly ate up?  Well, you'll just have to see the movie.

The picture provided on this disc is wide screen anamorphic, and special features include an eight minute tribute to Ray Harryhausen entitled `Return to the Valley' where contemporary special effects artists gush over Harryhausen and tell how he influenced them and the various films they've worked on, most notably Jurassic Park.  There is also like four or five trailers for other films Harryhausen worked on, including The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.  I thoroughly enjoy The Valley of the Gwangi, even though I understand others have thought the movie to be bit slow, in the beginning, at least.  I understand this, as the really cool dinosaurs don't appear until about halfway into this 95-minute feature.  Fans of Ray Harryhausen will not be disappointed, but others may find themselves looking for the chapter stop where the dinosaurs are...all in all a nifty western adventure with a good helping of thrilling science fiction provided by a true pioneer of special effects.  By the way, where did they find this actress who played the love interest to James Franciscus?  She was somewhat attractive, but her wooden acting skills certainly made me root for a big, hungry, salivating primal beastie to gobble her up quickly.

425294,4,6302101743,"This was one of the least financially successful of stop-motion animation master Ray Harryhausen films, which is a shame, since it's one of the wildest and most interesting. Based on an idea by Willis O'Brien, the visual effects master on the 1933 ""King Kong,"" ""The Valley of Gwangi"" is basically a re-imagining of ""Kong"" as a Western. Yep, you heard that right, pardners: this is a Giant Monster meets the Western film.
Now come on, that's got your attention, right?
""Gwangi"" is just a blast. Watching the mixture of cowboy antic with a lost land of dinosaurs is the ultimate Saturday morning matinee experience. The kid in you will just wake up right away and start cheering. (As for kids themselves, do you really have to ask? They'll love this!)
At this point in his career, Harryhausen was producing masterful effects and getting more ambitious with each film. Here he has a sequence of cowboys roping an Allosaurus (astounding!), and later a rampaging dinosaur caught in a burning cathedral. Even with today's computer effects, Harryhausen's effects have a wonderful marvel to them, a magic that CGI can't really capture. (Unless you're Peter Jackson.)
Like most of the films Harryhasen produced with Charles Schneer, the actual dramatics and script are a bit lacking. James Franciscus is right on the money in his part as the smooth-talking frontier huckster, but Gila Golan is wooden and terrible as his love interest. The dialogue often clunky, but don't worry -- the dinosaurs or a cowboy shoot-up are right about the corner.

The DVD also contains a featurette interview with Harryhausen, where he explains how the film came to be made and talks about how he achieved the incredible ""dino-roping"" sequence. Your appreciation of this visual effects genius will only go up when you hear what he had to do to get this amazing scene to work.

425314,4,6302101743,"Resurrecting an aborted project that Willis ( KING KONG ) O'Brien wanted to make himself, Ray Harryhausen followed-up his successful Hammer film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. with this movie, working once again with longtime  partner Charles H. Schneer. Filmed in Spain, this 1969 offering has  stunning stop-motion animated dinosaurs.
  Set around the turn of the  century in Mexico, it is a very Kong-like tale of a mighty creature ( the  titular Allosaurus with T-Rex attributes ) that is captured in  ""Forbidden Valley"" and brought back to a local Wild West show /  circus to make money. The monster flees its bonds and proceeds into a  magnificent cathedral, which becomes consumed in a raging inferno and  brings about its demise.
  Harryhausen, who worked a full year on the  special effects, effectively populates a valley that is lost in time with a  number of prehistoric animals, which include an equine Eohippus, a  ""plucked ostrich"" called an Ornithomimus and a horned  Styracosaurus who fights Gwangi to the death in a memorable sequence. The  highlight is a well-staged roping sequence which consumed many months of  Ray's time to realize; he had to carefully align the animated ropes on the  Gwangi model with real ropes used in live action to snare a Jeep with a  pole affixed.
  Other key points include the escape of Gwangi from its  cage ( a split-screen process was used in the making of this effect ) and  battle with an eleplant model, and its fiery finale in the great edifice (  utilizing the optical printer to superimpose flames around the allosaur's  feet ). Ray Harryhausen outdid himself for this feature which includes  literally hundreds of animation set-ups to concoct the visual effects.
  Unfortunately, the live-action sequences do not show as much panache.  James Franciscus and Gila Golan do not create any sparks as the movie's  leading couple. Curtis Arden is okay as Lope but no more, and Richard  Carlson looks haggard as the impresario of the circus troupe. The only  bright spot is the amiable performance of Laurence Naismith as the slightly  eccentric Professor Bromley who recognizes the miniature horse for what it  is.
  Even though it was a commercial failure in 1969 due to a number  of unfortunate circumstances that took place ( lack of advertising, its  pairing with an R-rated movie and changes in cultural tastes ), THE VALLEY  OF GWANGI is a spectacular adventure teeming with fantastic creatures and  exotic settings that should not be overlooked. The superficial storyline  and other shortcomings pale when Ray works his legendary magic. A highly  recommended picture that is only unsuitable for the the very youngest of  children ( under 5 yrs. of age ).",945475200,28,2707,5.0
425315,3,6302101743,"I like this movie.  I consider it to be something of a classic, in an arcane sense.  The Valley of Gwangi was a unique mixture of genres:  The Western and the Dinosaur Sci-Fi!  Seeing the characters react to and deal  with this creature in that setting is an interesting premise.  Remember,  this was the turn of the LAST century.  No hi-tech weapons or science were  available.
A mildy interesting, if not predictable, character sub-plot  developed for quite a while, until Gwangi and his prehistoric brethren  appeared.  I am unphazed by the biological/paleontological licenses taken  by the filmmakers.  After all, in sci-fi, suspension of disbelief is what  it's all about.
In the end, the star of the movie is the great Ray  Harryhausen, whose stop motion art is legendary.  Ray always seemed to give  his animated characters a character!  Unlike the monstrous, unthinking  Anaconda or T-Rex of the Computer Generated Era.  If you imerse yourself in  the setting, you will be awestruck, scared and eventually compassionate  about this creature.  This Harryhausen ability to impart pathos to the  monster was never more evident than in his creature from Venus in ""20  Million Miles to Earth.""  (Which I also recommend!)
Finally a word  about the leading man, James Francsicus.  People always put him in Heston's  shadow, but I thought he did a good job here.  As for his attractive (if  not greatly talented) co-star Gina Golan...I never heard from her  again!

Even had it been done in black  & white, thereby avoiding the ever-changing coloring of the SEs, it still would not hold up. Their sizes vary far too much, and too frequently to be semi-persuasive.

Plus, why on earth did those 4 or 5 horse continue to ride in short circles as the 2 dinosaurs fought? I mean, I understand the need for imminent danger to humanoids, but that is just silly. Sorry,  but this, for me, doesn't even qualify as memory-lane stuff, though I am surprised I'd never heard of it until a few weeks ago!",1525996800,,655,4.308943089430894
7821267,1,6302101743,"I actually like this movie but as with many of the old 50's sci-fi hits being released on Blueray, there are no closed captions.  Since the target audience is aged, it would seem producers would understand captions is a make or break deal with many of us.  That's why the one star.",1524528000,,281,4.384615384615385
7821268,5,6302101743,"Title of my review says it all.  A lesser known Harryhausen film, but still right up there with the rest of 'em, it was sadly released with very little fanfare opposite some more ""adult"" films and was left by the wayside as movies progressed into the gritty, and, rather shoddy, '70s Hollywood fare where rich, period piece extravaganzas were replaced by trailer parks, trash-filled alleys and such.  Anyway, after a mystifying series of events, cowboys from a turn-of-the-century wild west show discover a living Allosaurus in a remote Mexican valley and bring him back to civilization - well, a big village, anyway, where the dinosaur wreaks havoc.  A couple of moments of PG-rated violence, but, great for family viewing, especially if you have dinosaur-fan tykes.  Jaded mall-rats expecting Jurassic Park, not so much.  Gwangi was excellently brought to life by Harryhausen, but, for some odd reason, seems to sort of glow blue, for some reason.  I find it kinda distracting, as none of his other dinosaurs have ever done that.  Nevertheless, recommended.",1522540800,,1059,5.122093023255814

 from previous films and threw them in here.  Maybe  because it was cheaply done or the process didn't improve much, the live action is extremely grainy (due to the reprocessing necessary to match the live action and model work as well as the use of rear projection) and the color flickers quite a bit.",1517356800,,445,4.25
