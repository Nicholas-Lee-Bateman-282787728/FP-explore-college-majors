6589031,5,B00MMPB6QI,"Think ""Delta Force"" 2015 with out the great Chuck Norris. What to keep your eye on in this film, it is not the aging big name actors such as Rutger Hauer ""Bladerunner"" fame. Rather the heroic yet menacing role played by actor Christopher Elassad who sets the pace this action packed thriller.  Look for him to be kicking in a door to a theater near you.",1410566400,6,353,4.348484848484849

6589047,5,B00MMPB6QI,"If you like the classic action movie genre, this is a really good action movie and that is how I base my rating. Think US vs. Terrorists kind of movie where an elite force goes in and gets the job done. Some solid acting here across the board from some veterans of the genre. Newcomer Chris Elassad was a standout as the heroic Sgt. McCray, hopefully we'll be seeing more of him.",1420329600,2,379,4.277777777777778

6589069,5,B00MMPB6QI,"Classic low-budget action flick. In the vein of the old Chuck Norris films but contemporary (and better). If you like nonstop action, shoot-outs and explosions then Operation Rogue is awesomely fun.",1414454400,9,198,5.419354838709677
6589070,2,B00MMPB6QI,A classic low budget poorly acted film. This film reminds me of the low budget classic martial arts films of the 70's. If you are in the mood for a good laugh rent this puppy.,1411776000,2,175,4.0285714285714285
6589071,2,B00MMPB6QI,"This is another US vs. the terrorists film. The setting is the south Philippine Islands where our marines have a base to go after terrorists along with G-Tech, a contractor. The bad guys have acquired wooden crates with TNT written on them (no proper UN markings as required by international treaty to transport). Somehow they got a hold of some radioactive cesium 137 which they non-nonchalantly carry around, most likely giving themselves a lethal dose.

They plan to explode these bombs in Manila during a counter terrorism conference. Jenna Wallace (Sofia Pernas), the general's daughter  is brought in as a contractor to stop the bad guys and finds herself a career hostage. We also get to see the fundamentalist Muslim terrorists do drugs with party girls.

The film had a simple straight forward plot that would have made Seagal green with envy. Other than the location, this was a me-too anti-terrorist film with formulaic results. Acting and dialogue couldn't carry the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1411171200,4,1027,5.059171597633136
