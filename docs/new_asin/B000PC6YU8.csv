2816075,5,B000PC6YU8,"Hemalayaa has given women all over the world an incredible gift in this video.  It is like no other video out there. So many of us in our day to day work have lost our luscious sensuality.  It makes you feel so good.  This video is absolutely gorgeous, the filming, the details, the music, and the reference to our human spirit.  I think all women should be given this as a gift.  My sister loved it too.  There certainly is nothing else like it right now in the U.S.",1199491200,27,467,4.191011235955056
2816076,3,B000PC6YU8,"I love Hemalayaa's other DVDs. Yoga, Bollywood, I have them all. My instinct when I see she's come out with something new is to scoop it up quickly. This video, however, was a bit disappointing. It'd make a great workshop, as the moves are designed to celebrate and make you feel good about your body, and I feel like that'd be even more powerful in a group setting. The moves are even kind of fun to do. However, they mostly entail writhing around on the floor, and while it was somewhat relaxing, I didn't get much of a workout out of it. I was hoping that I could do some sensual dance, not take myself too seriously, but also get in my exercise for the day. Not so. There's a bunch of instruction in here about working your gaze, and then most of the rest is learning to move slowly and deliberately, in a flowing way. I must say, had I made up a sensual dance by myself, it would have included all of these elements :) There wasn't anything surprising about the routine.
I love watching Hemalayaa (she really is beautiful), but even the bonus dance routine she did was a little tedious. I'm hoping she'll release another yoga DVD soon.",1196640000,27,1140,4.382075471698113
2816077,1,B000PC6YU8,"Really not worth getting. This is a simplified, sexy version of yoga. You'd be better off getting a yoga workout dvd.",1191369600,4,117,4.619047619047619
2816078,5,B000PC6YU8,"This video is excellent! It's for any woman that wants to move her body, learn to love the body she's in and make it something sensual for her partner. This video allows for a lot of self expression and self interpretation. After doing this video a few times, your body will begin to have it's own movement and rhythm...perform these movements for yourself or for a lover and WOW. Sensual, empowering, beautiful, feminine and incredibly fluid, this is an exotic dance video without being demeaning or without objectifying anyone. Simply amazing. And perfect for any body type or fitness level. Smile and enjoy yourself. Is there anything sexier?",1190937600,13,645,4.981481481481482
2816079,4,B000PC6YU8,"I have to admit that I first sneered when I saw this and then I thought ""why not?"".  I am glad that I purchased this. It's a me video. Not a perform become a bellydance star video. I enjoyed just doing some of the sitting down workouts. I did it even at work. The music is relaxing. And Hemalayaa's words of believing yourself and dancing the way you feel and showing how you can more was beautiful and even easy for a beginner. I am glad I didn't walk away from this DVD. It will be cherished in my collection and I look forward to getting another DVD with Hemalayaa.",1189814400,35,568,4.163636363636364
2816080,5,B000PC6YU8,"I've done the Carmen Elektra stuff, and pretty much got what I expected, but when I did this one, I was really surprised by the shift in perspective.  Being sexy isn't about impressing a partner with moves -- it's about being in touch with yourself and your sensual nature, and reveling in that.  Hemalayaa is an excellent guide!  I had tried her Bollywood Workout and had a lot of fun with it.  Her DVDs just keep getting better!",1186963200,56,430,4.4743589743589745
2816081,3,B000PC6YU8,"I am a fan of Hemalayaa and the challenge I found with this DVD was the slow pace. I found the slow pace difficult because I am accustomed to faster pace movement. With this, I needed to coach myself to slow down and enter the experience. This is the point of this exercize so if you looking for a ""rocking"" time. Go with her Bollywood tapes.",1426636800,,342,4.196969696969697
2816082,5,B000PC6YU8,"Very empowering. Not really a workout. More like a slow stretch to raise awareness and boost your self esteem as a person. One of the funnest ways to get ""centered""",1424822400,4,164,4.5
2816083,5,B000PC6YU8,"I read through the one star reviews and they were easy to dismiss. Honestly, I don't understand the mindset that a dance video is worthless unless it makes you sweat and burn. It's the same mindset that the slow gentle Hatha yoga of previous generations is of no use. Now yoga classes seem only to sell if they are done in extreme heat, the vinyasas are difficult and rapid fire to satisfy students' impatience, and they provide an aerobic workout. In my massage practice I see it, too.  So many people are only satisfied with painful deep tissue now.
If the above beliefs apply to you, don't get this video. And for heaven's sake, don't get it and then whine about it. This video is about slow, mindful dance. It's about reconnecting to sensuality in your probably desensitized and overused body. And as I suggested it also requires a fair degree of quiet mindfulness. Anybody who wants to try playfully using their bodies in a slow, gentle, playful and sensual way, will find the video aesthetically pleasing, enjoyable, and even immensely therapeutic.",1421107200,8,1054,4.791208791208791

2816091,5,B000PC6YU8,"This DVDis absolutely stunning! The cinematography, the content, the music, and the references to the human spirit throughout. Hemalayaa has given an incredible gift to women all over the world. Many women, in their day to day work, as business women, Moms, and even spouses, have lost their  sensuality.

2816093,5,B000PC6YU8,"Just watch and learn, Some of these moves should be against the law.  It's beauty automatically becomes your own. You'll learn to move like a goddess. really bold",1384560000,2,162,4.785714285714286
2816094,5,B000PC6YU8,"This really brings the beauty back into a woman's everyday life, which I think should be a mandatory part of a woman's life.

It's hard to remember that as a woman who's busy shuffling everyone's life before her own, and though we embrace those challenges and usually kick butt!!! We need to remember that without being a healthy dose of selfish, we have nothing to give others!!

What better way to feel sexy than with a dance based on the kama sutra, to remember our beauty, our passion, our femininity and yes sexuality as a woman!!!!",1381276800,2,537,4.583333333333333

2816097,3,B000PC6YU8,"Perfect for those into neo-""Tantra"", new age or western ""Yoga"". The movements were not so bad. The camera work and constant shifting or blending scenes is quite distracting. I think if it were filmed better and deeper explanation for the movements were given as to WHY they are are good for this or that, it would be much better. If you just want to see a pretty girl trying hard to look sensual, though hard to see due to the filming, you might like this. If you are looking for some new age, ""feel good"" movement, this will be great. This type of movement can be great to increase energy and flow, with more focus on breathing. Would make for a great warm up or a nice introduction to yoga and dance for those not so fit or who need work on their overall flow. I didn't mind it being slow, either because it's supposed to be. I might add a bit of my own knowledge to flesh it out a bit. Those interested in more authentic Yoga or Tantric practices would do well to avoid this.",1364774400,3,978,4.235294117647059

2816099,4,B000PC6YU8,"PROS:
-A slow dance that helps you get in touch with your inner goddess.
-This dance is a great way to pamper yourself and nourish your soul.
-Teaches you how to look and move seductively.
-Teaches you to love and respect your body.

CONS:
-An inordinate amount of time is spent on basic eye and neck movements.
-THIS IS NOT A WORKOUT VIDEO. Very few calories will be burned. This is a slow dance with yourself.",1357171200,3,411,4.407894736842105
2816100,2,B000PC6YU8,"If you are viewing this to learn more about the Kama Sutra, or for a workout, or to learn some dance moves, you will be disappointed.  The eye exercises gave me a headache and I had to shut the DVD off and watch the rest of it later.  I think this dvd WOULD be useful for meditation, if you are into that sort of thing.  Hemalaya is so blissed out and adorable--I'll have whatever she's on!  I do enjoy her as an instructor, but I prefer some of her other DVDs over this one.

What I was able to take away from this is her flirtatious glances, her smiles, and how she looks toward and then away from her audience, drawing you in.  This DVD is well-made and beautiful and is more about channeling yourself then about a particular move or exercise.",1348876800,3,746,4.21830985915493
2816101,3,B000PC6YU8,"I loooove Hemalayaa's workout videos and have purchased several, but I was disappointed with this one.  It is not a true ""workout."" I ended up switching to a different Hemalayaa video and finished my workout without finishing this video.  I would not buy this particular video again, but I would recommend Hemalayaa's other videos for a great and fun workout.  My favorites are ""Bollywood Booty"" and ""Bollywood Dance Workout.""  I also enjoyed ""Yoga for Everyone.""",1340668800,,463,5.133333333333334
2816102,3,B000PC6YU8,It's more a seductive dance than anything else.  If you are looking for the actual karma sutra then go buy the book.  When I say seductive dancing--there's no strip tease or pole dancing here.  It's about making yourself feel sexy so you appear sexy to your partner.,1338249600,,266,4.617021276595745
2816103,3,B000PC6YU8,"Though it's listed with the other ""fitness"" videos, this really can't be considered a workout. It is an excellent relaxation style routine that could be done early in the morning or before bed. I just went through the routine for the first time and found it tough to get in to. There's a lot of ""do whatever you feel - whatever comes natural"" - which is nice - but I prefer a more defined routine (for instance, Dolphina's Goddess Workout - the Beginner's video would be more what I expected out of this). I may give this one another shot in the future, but for now it's just not my cup of tea.",1327104000,,594,4.265486725663717
2816104,5,B000PC6YU8,I really enjoyed this video. My body temperature rose and I felt very relaxed and happy doing the exercises and after. I felt that it was a moving meditation. I like this video alot because it has no pressure feel. I know that even when I don't want to work out Ill still want to do this video.,1307059200,3,294,4.086206896551724
2816105,5,B000PC6YU8,"The best part -- you don't need to be wearing shoes or any funky attire. The instructions are very clear and almost hypnotic, and it's a nice break from all the conventional exercise and meditation routines.",1304899200,2,207,4.777777777777778
2816106,2,B000PC6YU8,"Ok, I have no idea how to begin this review.  I thought this had nothing to do with the Kama Sutra, I was disappointed.  And this is supposed to be a very improved DVD from her other videos.  You are kidding me right.  Let's put it this way, I could have made this video and sold it to you all.  I cannot send it back to the seller because I am not happy with the video, but I am going to honest and let the next person know my opinion.  Again this is just my opinion.  I am putting it out to re-sell on Amazon, and despite the fact that it may hurt my chances of selling it, so please be buyer conscious.  This is my first video by Hemalayaa, bought the 'Beautiful Belly' DVD as well and again not the best. So that was the last DVD by Hemalayaa.  Sorry, but I had to be honest.",1302652800,2,779,3.910828025477707
2816107,2,B000PC6YU8,really is not a dvd for who want to learn something..the lady only dance \i am not happy at all,1300924800,,95,3.8
2816108,4,B000PC6YU8,"This workout is hard to discribe. Slow, sensious movements combined with some yoga poses (like cat and cobra). It has some dance movements, but everything is slow. It's physically and mentally relaxing, and it's not cardio. I liked it and would use it for relaxation after a stressful day. Hemalayaa offers positive commentary throughout, in voice-over format. The set and music are beautiful as usual.

At one point you do a mudra over your ovaries while Hemalayaa talks about your chi, also they show her lighting incense at an alter with statues (Shiva and Kali?), so if this is going to offend your personal religion, just be warned.",1296172800,7,637,4.898148148148148
2816109,4,B000PC6YU8,"This dvd is a pleasant surprise.  Flawed a bit in instruction but mostly a pleasure.  Hemalayaa leads a simple and very sensual practice, most of which is done on the floor (always a good thing for me!).  She encourages the viewer to think of a beloved one--either a lover, a friend, or a god/dess--and to devote the practice to your beloved.

The movements are very slow.  It feels like a luxurious stretch but when you watch Hemalayaa do it you quickly realize just how sexy a stretch can be, especially when it is done very slowly.  It would be easy to dismiss some of the instructions as silly (look coyly at your love, offer flowers from the heart) but in the context of the video these all sound like lovely and loving suggestions.  I was able to easily follow along, for the most part, until the practice moved to a standing one.  Moving from a sitting to a standing movement was a challenge for me and would probably be difficult for people with hip or knee problems.

But this is a ""dance"" and moving with your own body is what this workout is all about.  You won't be dripping sweat.  This isn't hard cardio.  Think more a dancing yoga practice meant to awaken your inner seductress.  Anyone who is uncomfortable in her own body will surely become more confident watching and practicing along with this dvd.  I would imagine that even the most clumsy woman will find herself moving in ways that feel sexy and the body learns and listens from repetition.  Muscle memory will be there when you want to feel sexy and you may find yourself moving in ways that before you would have felt either uncomfortable doing or unattractive in attempting.

What is most remarkable is that throughout it all I didn't catch myself thinking, ""Of course she looks sexy doing that--look at her.""  Instead, I just allowed myself to follow along, enjoy the experience, and  follow along with Hemalayaa's gentle lead.  My only disappointment in this whole practice is that she didn't suggest at the beginning the object of love for whom the viewer is doing this dance could be the self.  At the end she does say something about loving the self and that love begins with loving one's self.  I hope more people watching and doing this dvd will dedicate their practice to themselves.  I think that would be a great blessing.",1284249600,15,2308,4.605392156862745
2816110,5,B000PC6YU8,"I loved this video. women forget what charms we have been born with, this video brings some of that charm back. Hemealayaa is so beautful and moves like a ribon in a breeze, I loved being brought back to my body. We forget that we even have a body during the busy day. We don't move our bodies enough, so if we make the slightest wrong moves our back goes out , we walk and move so stifly. I felt like a sexy goddess after doing this . Hopfully if I do it several times a week it will carry through the day and I will feel like a woman again. throw those jeans and tennis shoes away and be sexy like you were meant to be.  The background and furnishings were like being in an Indian palace, and music was moving through the body. I have to give 5 stars to this as everything was very well put together, also her voice and instructions were slow enough I could follow and understand.",1281052800,18,882,4.098265895953757
2816111,3,B000PC6YU8,"This dvd is not only sexy and empowering, but also relaxing. I liked the opening the heart portion at the beginning. It is a lot of writhing on the floor, but it's not all floor work. Some of the moves are a little uncomfortable, especially if you're overweight, but I suspect to feel comfortable each time I do it. I wouldn't consider it a workout, but I was sweating by the end. It makes you feel good about being a woman and it makes you feel good about yourself. I felt sexy all through this dvd.",1277942400,6,500,4.21875
2816112,5,B000PC6YU8,"Let's hear it for the Hindu beliefs and their Kama Sutra! I have to say I felt a little silly when I started the DVD. All I could think about was the reviews that I had read about women rolling on the floor and giggling at themselves. To me, that pretty well accounts to how sexy I feel. I giggle. So I have to say that this DVD made me feel sexy in my tattered sweats and legs I should have shaved a week ago! There was quite a bit of rolling on the floor and since I am a plus sized girl, I did more wallowing than rolling. But at the end, I felt great. It really did help me realize that feeling wonderful needs to start with yourself and then can come from an outer influence. If I could high-five Hemalayaa I would. This DVD definitly taught me a lesson about who I am and how I feel, or should feel, about myself.",1265673600,12,819,3.9696969696969697
2816113,3,B000PC6YU8,"There are sections to this DVD, however, it really feels as if it is meant to be used as a whole.  I do think maybe if I were to do it again, I might skip the first section, though, as the whole DVD seemed to build a little too slow for me.  I understood that it was a slow dance, but just a little faster build might be better.

I did enjoy the DVD, though, and several times found I had a small smile on my face.  The main reasons I only scored a three is the slow build and the fact that I probably wouldn't use the DVD frequently.  However, if you have some quiet ""me"" time and want to relax and feel seductive, this would be a good option.

SECTIONS:
Invocation: Heart Awareness (6 minutes) -
  quiet meditation to set the mood

Open the Neck and the Eyes (13 minutes) -
  Gentle neck rolls and stretches, followed by eye movements. Then the start of some gentle dancing cat pose varations, including some nice arm circles

The Offering (9 minutes) -
  Gentle, seductive, rolling on the floor, cobra, dancing legs while lying on the back.  Builds into the next section, adding some arm movements.

Seduction with the Arms (8 minutes) -
  Arm movements, floor dancing, various seductive poses remaining on the floor

Standing Moves (6 minutes) -
  Slowly coming to standing, and gentle dancing

Circle, Sway, & Focus ( 7 minutes)
  Dancing adding hip movements and sways.",1264809600,35,1375,4.451612903225806

Great for those who are stiff and want to get out of themselves and become more aware of your body.  The only minus I had is trying to do the moves and focus on my focal point without looking at Hemalayaa to see what she is actually doing.
