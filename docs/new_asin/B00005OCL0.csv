The movie isn't bad.  If you like Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman or Charlie's Angels of the mid to late 1970s then you will probably enjoy this movie - The Doll Squad.",1385769600,,247,4.23404255319149
1641067,3,B00005OCL0,"The Doll Squad is a tantalizing piece of 70s sexploitation/action movies. While there isn't any nudity to speak of, at least one of the actresses, (yes, they were called actresses back then), is attractive in a 70s sort of way.

1641068,3,B00005OCL0,"Ted V. Mikels has made some of the strangest and most entertaining low-budget movies in history. Who could not appreciate ""The Astro-Zombies,"" ""The Corpse Grinders,"" of best of all ""The Corpse Grinders II?"" 1973's ""The Doll Squad"" is a bit of departure from straight sci-fi, and capitalizes on the gadgetry so popular with the cold war spy genre of the era with a healthy dose of the always-popular bikini quotient thrown in for good measure. The premise is simple: a madman, Eamon O'Reilly (Michael Ansara,) gets the attention of the US government by blowing up the ""Starflight 12"" rocket (think Apollo stock footage with really cheesy special effects.) There's a note sent by messenger pigeon from an island off the coast of Venezuela, demanding secret documents to assist in O'Reilly's conquest of the world...who will save the day?

Senator Stockwell (John Carter,) who is for some reason in charge of national space policy, calls in the top secret Doll Squad, headed, coincidentally enough, by O'Reilly's ex-girlfriend Sabrina Kincaid (Francine York) and her amazing mane of hair. They have lots of tricks (e.g. rings that squirt mace, etc.) up their jumpsuit sleeves, and the lethal firepower necessary to mount an attack on O'Reilly's island stronghold (Catalina Island and Zsa Zsa Gabor's house are stand-ins,) but not before Lavelle Sumara (Tura Satana) dances around for awhile. When the girls get to O'Reilly's place there's lots of action, lots of overblown B-movie dramatics, some extremely lame special effects (with a special guest appearance not only by Ted V. Mikels himself, but also Ted's portable clothes rack as an implement of torture,) and the big plot reveal about how the world domination is to occur. It turns out rat breeding is a key element in the plan, but weaponry, cunning, a really big sword, and an ""altitude bomb"" save the day, keeping the world safe for democracy once again.

While ""The Doll Squad"" isn't one of my favorite Ted V. Mikels films, it's still an enjoyable piece of 1970's B-movie history, and I recommend it to low-budget film connoisseurs everywhere.",1282521600,2,2101,5.069364161849711

The film is enjoyable, though a bit more plodding than some of Ted's other movies. As always, the best part of the DVD is listening to Ted's commentary, which ranges from insightful comments about the locations, actors, etc., to mind-numbing trivia that is still part of the enjoyable patina of the film (""That couch, by the way, belonged to Barbara Hutton...."") There's a lot of extremely obvious comments from Ted (""OK Tura, set those bombs..."") and don't miss the seemingly never-ending sagas of how Ted lost a diamond ring in the ocean and how he once kept ""Herbie in the closet"" for over an hour. Despite all that, I really enjoy listening to Ted, and definitely recommend the commentary track. The DVD also has trailers and an extra featuring Tura Satana sharing her memories of ""The Doll Squad,"" which I also liked.

1641070,4,B00005OCL0,"The Doll Squad (1973) People often ask me ""Why do you watch all of those weird/awful/strange/bad movies?"" Because every once in a while I see a movie as terrific as this one! This low budget action flick from producer/director Ted V. Mikels hits all the right notes and entertained me thoroughly from first frame to last. Bad guy Michael Ansara (Star Trek) is a renegade ex-CIA agent with delusions of Bond villain: he topples a rocket launch to get the US government's attention and then blackmails them with threat of a new super-bubonic plague he'll release everywhere. His price: to be made leader of the world! The US government's response? Agent Anthony Eisley (Dracula vs. Frankenstein) gives the word: send in the greatest counter espionage force in the world: The Doll Squad! Led by redhead Sabrina (Francine York), these women (including the notorious Tura Satana-Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!) live by the three B's: bikinis, bullets, and bombs! They launch an all out assault on Ansara's island base and the bad guys don't stand a chance! This is the most entertaining movie I've seen from the ever eclectic Mikels, with lots of terrible 70's fashions, action, bikinis, machine guns, stunts and explosions, all set to a hip and happening 70's score. It's especially fun to notice not one explosion is done live, every one of them is instead superimposed in. (Safety first must be Ted's motto.) Strangely, there is no full nudity, though Tura does get in one scene with pasties. On the violence side though, we got kung fu, gun fu, knife fu, cigarette lighter flamethrower fu, bottle busted over head fu, bazooka fu, electric cord on wet guy fu, sword fu and explosive Mickey Finn fu! Awesome! Now, a lot has been said and written, starting with Ted V. Mikels himself, that this movie might have influenced producer Aaron Spelling into creating Charlie's Angels. It is interesting that the smart leader of the Doll Squad is named Sabrina, the same as the ""smart one"" of the Angels. I see the similiarities (women in sexy clothes battling bad guys) but there are differences too. The Angels usually went undercover in sexy outfits to get evidence to bring the bad guy down. The Doll Squad boats out to the island and lays waste to everyone on it. I can see both sides, guess I'll stay on the fence for this one. But in any case, if you enjoy fast moving 70's style low budget action, you have got to check this one out!",1241568000,3,2428,4.7559241706161135

7948820,3,B00005OCL0,"Doll Squad is kinda clunky... it seems to like a high school production at times.. even the better-known thespians seem to have trouble with their dialog and their motivation..  It's campy, has some Ed Wood worthy action and scripting.  I don't know if the sloppy cuts are due to scenes being removed, or simply bad editing, but you see a flash of a scene before a completely different scene, with different actors, takes over.....

The movie DEFINITELY could use more Tura Satana .... she is a joy to watch.  It's not the best example of its genre... but I have spent a worse hour and a half....",1508803200,,596,4.542056074766355

7948822,3,B00005OCL0,"The Doll Squad is one hour and thirty  one minutes and was released in theaters on September 19, 1973. The main story line is that a rocket ship blows up and a CIA operative sends Sabrina to stop the person behind all of this. Sabrina rounds up the Doll Squad and the adventure begins. There is an ongoing goof in the movie. When the Dolls are shooting at the guards it is pitch black, but when you see the guards get shot it seems to be dusk. Overall it is an okay movie, tamed by today standards. The Doll Squad gets a C.

7948824,4,B00005OCL0,"Just finished watching ""The Doll Squad"" released by Alpha Home Entertainment.
According to Hollywood legend, ""The Doll Squad"" was the insipiration for ""Charlie's Angels,"" and after watching this movie, I can say that there may, just may, be some truth to that particular piece of Tinsel Town Mythology.
Written, directed, and produced by schlock master Ted V. Mikels, ""The Doll Squad"" is at times a straight adventure, sometimes outright spoof of the spy genre.
Actress Francie York brings red-haired CIA spy Sabrina to life - if Aaron Spelling did see this movie, than when he created ""Charile's Angels"" he spread all of Sabrina's charactersitcs across three of the original ""Angels,"" even naming one after this character.
The plot of ""The Doll Squad"" is rather simple.  After blowing up the Star Flight 12 mission, ex-CIA agent and newly minted villian Eamon O'Rielly is blackmailing a United States Senator to hand over top secret microfilm, otherwise he'll create further destruction.
Sabrina is called into action after a computer recommends that the Doll Squad be activated.
Naturally Eamon's goons tries to killl members of the Doll Squad that Sabrina calls into action, and they succeed in killing two of them.
After some carefully coded word play hinting that she will be forced to commit oral sex that involves a cigarette in a crowded restaurant, Sabrina excapes the attempt on her life with a cigrarette lighter that doubles as an explosive flame thrower.
Upon learning that two of her recruits have been killed, Sabrina debriefs the Senator and recruits her other team members in a manner that hints of Lipstick Lesbian Chic  [Stop DROOLING Barry Misterbgone Adaska....;)].
Sabrina and her team fly out to Eamon's island lair via United and launch an attack on his secret fortress.  Here's where the movie starts to get more than schlockly.  All the members of the Doll Squad strip out of their bikinis [off the screen] and into their uniforms - back jump suits with white trim and white high heel boots.
What follows next is a shoot-them-up and blow-them-up mayhem as the Doll Squad seek to finish their mission.
Now, this isn't a great movie, but it is a fun 70s schlock movie [No Zack Newsome, you may not borrow this movie, your parents would KILL me for letting you watch it.]
Recommended for Cult Movie Lovers!

7948825,1,B00005OCL0,"Although the story seemed minutely interesting, it was a horrible movie overall. Not only a poor plot, but also the video did not play very well at all. There must be a problem with the transfer. I recommend passing on The Doll Squad and investing in something worthwhile like The Centerfold Girls if you want suspense, action and something with entertainment value.",1405296000,,366,4.919354838709677
7948826,5,B00005OCL0,"One of the best bad movies ever made. Some of the acting is hilariously horrible, as are the fake explosions. But oddly enough, the stunt work and bullet wounds are realistic and first-rate, as is the music -- like that's what they spent all the money on. This movie had me laughing out loud in spots, and scratching my head, too. Why do some of the guards on the island ride on the hoods of the vehicles? Isn't that dangerous? And how can the driver see with two men sitting on the hood? And why is Michael Ansara, who was born in Syria, playing someone named Eamon O'Reilly? And why does Eamon order Rafael, the pill-popping Gilligan-wannabe, to guard the dangerous Sabrina all by himself? And why does the Doll Squad convince two guards to drink explosive whiskey (a new way to get ""bombed"", I suppose) when it would be much easier just to shoot them? Who cares? Just sit back, laugh out loud, scratch your head and stare at all the boobs. Oh by the way, watch for the scene in the restaurant where Sabrina uses a cigarette lighter/flamethrower to burn the face of a bad guy. As he's sitting there, screaming in agony, his face horribly mutilated, watch the reaction -- or lack thereof -- from the people sitting in the next booth. It's priceless.",1399161600,3,1250,4.511013215859031
