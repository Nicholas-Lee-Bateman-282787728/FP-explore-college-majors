7837286,1,6303103324,This DVD was an international copy and would not play in any of the DVD players that were used. I bought it as a gift for my Mom and she's been unable to watch it. I am displeased.,1496534400,,180,3.763157894736842
7837287,2,6303103324,Just as I remembered it! I loved it and will buy more of his work for sure. Frankie Howerd was a true master of timing and innuendo. What a wonderful lasting legacy of laughter he has left us,1399852800,,191,4.052631578947368
7837288,3,6303103324,"This movie is OK, quite well reproduced, but the humour is only ordinary. (Wouldn't say the same thing about the ladies). But overall nothing really great, just an OK movie with a bit of fun.",1390176000,,191,4.485714285714286
7837289,3,6303103324,"Although I received this DVD prior to the estimated delivery date, I was expecting the ""Up Pompeii"" TV series and not the movie version. This was a randy romp though a semi-Roman extravaganza. I'll be crunching this DVD for sure!!!",1360713600,,231,4.8
7837290,5,6303103324,A wonderfully daft movie based on the hilarious television series. Frankie Howard couldn't be more effeminate if he tried. Madeline Smith is gorgeous and the jokes come thick and fast.,1325894400,,184,5.166666666666667
7837291,3,6303103324,"The late great Frankie Howerd pouts and leers his way in inimical style through this 90 minute bawdy romp set in the famous doomed Roman city.  This big screen adaptation of the much loved TV series is noticeably naughtier than the small-screen version, with 15-rated nudity aplenty and double-entendres (and a few blatant single-entendres) in almost every scene.

Although only Frankie as Lurcio, the slave, and the innocent young master (with the not-so-innocent odes to his latest love) seem to have survived the transition to cinema, most of the other characters are played by familiar faces from British cinema and all the usual plot elements are still there. This is pretty well classic English farce, in similar vein to some of the historical Carry On films made around the same time.  Some of the gags are pretty lame, whilst others may make us wince a bit in today's politically correct climate. I defy anyone not to laugh out loud at least a couple of times during the movie though.

Corny? Yes  Hammy? Sure, but just go with the flow and enjoy. As a testimony to happier, more innocent days, Up Pompeii is definitely worthwhile.

Salute!",1146960000,7,1148,4.861538461538461
7837292,5,6303103324,"This review refers to the two-video boxed set of the 1970 British comedy series Up Pompeii starring Frankie Howerd (ASIN 6304269544).  I mention this as there is also a 90-minute movie, and reviews are posted next to both items, regardless of the one to which they actually refer.
Having only ever ""experienced"" Frankie Howerd once before (in 1978's ill-fated Sgt. Pepper movie), my expectations for this series were none too high.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a cute series as this one.  Frankie Howerd is (in my view) simply unsurpassed as a comedian, and in my opinion this series is quite hilarious.  On the one hand, it is a situational comedy, and as such it is extremely zany and light but with an abundance of wit (mostly in the form of puns, double entendres, and other such wordplay).  On the other hand, the series also has elements of stand-up comedy, with Howerd frequently speaking in asides to the audience in addition to addressing them outright.
One example of the type of jokes to expect:  Howerd says to a messenger who`s been stabbed, ""You can`t die here, it`s the living room.""  It`s the type of humour that would have one groaning in less skilled hands (okay, it has one groaning even here), but Howerd is able to carry it off.  This example notwithstanding, the humour is generally fairly bawdy, though in the nicest possible way.  In other words, any bawdiness is usually the result of the viewer/audience ""catching"" a second meaning for a word or phrase!  (I have, by the way, also seen the Up Pompeii movie, which I also enjoyed although I found it to be somewhat more sexually explicit (with some nudity) and the bawdy humour seemed a little more daring in places.  Although personally I preferred the series, the movie is certainly worth seeing if you enjoy bawdy British humour).
Each video in this set consists of three 30-35 minute episodes for a total of six episodes.  The plots of each episode are very simple and usually of the ""comedy of errors"" variety, and as is typical of many British comedies, variations of the same jokes appear in each episode.  Finally, an interest in classical Roman history is not required, for the setting (and indeed the story-lines themselves) are merely a vehicle for Howerd's talents and for the jokes.
As a point of interest, some of the episodes were produced by David Croft, and those familiar with Are You Being Served? may (or may not!) recognise Mollie Sugden (Mrs. Slocombe) and Larry Martyn (Mr. Mash) who make a very brief guest appearance.  A very slim and young Lynda Baron (Nurse Gladys from Open All Hours) also briefly appears in an episode.
Personally, I really enjoyed this light, zany series.  If you enjoy bawdy puns, innuendo and double entendres, I really do recommend checking it out.",1023494400,21,2796,4.783783783783784
7837293,4,6303103324,"Frankie Howard plays both actor and narrater in this risque and somewhat ludicrous account of the last days of Pompeii.  Frankie is a slave, Lurcio,  in the household of Ludicrus Sextus, (Michael Hordern, (A Funny Thing  Happend on the way to the Forum, Where Eagles Dare)), Ammonia (Barbara  Murrey) wife of Sextus and Erotica (Madaline Smith), and Nausius (Royce  Mills) the children of Sextus and Ammonia.  Nearly every thing said in this  film has a double meaning and if your mind is any where near the gutter  when you watch it you will catch most of them the first time around.  It is  one continous laugh or snicker through-out; I don't believe their is three  minuets between gags anywhere in the picture.  Pure humor through and  through.  Lurcio has an encounter with Bilbius who was delivering a  scroll, listing the names of everyone who was ploting to over throw Nero,  to the governor of Pompeii who is also in on the plot.  Hastely picking up  his vegitables, and accedently the scroll, Lurcio becomes the object of a  man hunt by Bilbius and some soldiers to regain the damaging evidence.  As  the story proceeds, we meet the disfunctional family of Sextus and some of  the off-beat inhabitants of Pompeii.  In fact, the only person in this  story who seems to have both feet on the ground is a slave of Prosterous  Maximus, (Bill Fraser), Governer of Pompeii.  She only appeared for four  minuets or so in this film which was a shame for she is very pretty and  more character development could have been done between her and Nausius who  wants to marry her but wouldn't know what to do with her after he did.  So, we have Lurcio hiding out from Bilbius, Sextus lashing out at the moral  decay of Pompeii while hosting orgies at his home, (sound like someone we  may have heard of?), Ammonia planning these parties with concern only of  what the Daily Tablet (their newspaper) has to say about what she was  wearing, Erotica's insatiable desires for men, Nausius who has the hots for  a woman and we wonder for half the picture if he even knows what the  differences are, Cassandra, first of the red hot lovers and wife of Maximus  who when asked to entertain Bilbius says "" I'm sure I can fit him  in,,, somewhere!"", and on and on and on.  Buy it, don't rent it.  These people are on a moon someplace and your sure to want to keep it.",969321600,10,2353,4.535885167464115
7837294,3,6303103324,"Oh my, it is bawdy, and in the US the words are a little hard to catch, or the jokes are odd, but it's typical low humor as the British do it.  In fact, it's not for youngsters because they might get the jokes!  Frankie  Howerd, who must have made his name in burlesque, is a slave in old Rome,  where all the men are stupid and the women are beautiful nymphomaniacs.  The names (Voluptua, Hilarius, etc.) are straight out of ""A Funny  Thing Happened..."" which still reigns as the best, but this one has  Plautus, occasionally looking down on the action from Mt. Olympus to make a  ribald comment.  Occasional nudity, the odd orgy or two, and constant  visual references to private parts--you get the picture.  But funny.",953424000,5,721,4.511627906976744
