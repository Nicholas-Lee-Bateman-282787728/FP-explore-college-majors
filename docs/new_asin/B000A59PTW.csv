8074852,5,B000A59PTW,This one very funny show about a horny photographer in the late 50's.  Bob Cummings is the star with a very good cast.  The funniest episodes  are with Bob as his grandfathe.  Old comedy that is still funny.,1454976000,,207,4.368421052631579

8074854,4,B000A59PTW,"Love that Bob or the Bob Cummings Show was probably cutting edge at the time. Bob Cummings humor is however dated. His playing Bob and Grandpa is obvious. Though do you want to see Ann B. Davis before she was Alice on the Brady Bunch? This is for you.  Or you liked Dobbie Gillis? Dwayne Hickman is a bumbling fool here, but he is cute.....and means well.  A great look at comedy and television in it's early years.",1389744000,2,415,4.3076923076923075
8074855,2,B000A59PTW,disappointing in the quality. I lave the shows in my youth and it was greats seeing them again. But the imagery was like VHS bumped to dvd.,1370908800,,139,4.185185185185185
8074856,5,B000A59PTW,All that it's missing is the old black and white TV that I used to watch this on. It plays great and the item is packaged well.,1355961600,4,127,3.740740740740741
8074857,5,B000A59PTW,"A hit television series by all accounts, Love That Bob highlights the romantic misadventures of Bob Collins (Robert Cummings), a suave bachelor and photographer who can't seem to shake his model-chasing ways - much to the amusement of gal pal Schultzy (Ann B. Davis) and disapproval of widowed sister Margaret (Rosemary DeCamp). Try as she might, Margaret can't seem to get her womanizing brother to settle down and become a proper role model for her college-aged son Chuck (Dwayne Hickman). Bob does his best, but his eye for beautiful women always gets the better of him. Despite his good intentions, he just can't seem to satisfy his sweet tooth for gorgeous models!

Tune in for guaranteed laughs and the comic exploits of a smooth-talking photographer who just might be a bachelor for life!

8074858,5,B000A59PTW,"A classic 50's show.  All decent transfers with good sound.

Bob Cummings is a master of comic timing, with a great supporting cast.  Dwayne Hickman tells us that Bob took him under his wing to teach him comic mastery.  You can see his influence in Dwayne's delightful series, ""Dobie Gillis"".

Good to have for fans if early television.",1341619200,4,336,4.724137931034483
