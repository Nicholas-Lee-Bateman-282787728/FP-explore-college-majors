7870489,4,6304388128,"Didn't much care about Iowa and sure didn't know a thing about it -- until viewing this very well-made documentary.  It draws you in and makes you care, emotionally appealing on many levels, a sensory treat.  Very similar  to Ken Burns' style, except shot on video, not film.  Excellent  cinematography & editing.  Many of the same voices that Burns often  uses.  Very effective music, and wonderful editing transitions between past  & present.  Would love to see this sort of treatment for other states  as well.  Truly a fine job!",945993600,,532,4.853932584269663
