2697022,5,B000KQF702,I really loved this movie. It was touching and funny. I am a big Bea Arthur fan as well. It is a really nice movie to have.,1209600000,3,123,3.5925925925925926
2697023,3,B000KQF702,"A sunny, funny comedy about love the second time around, MY FIRST LOVE is average Movie of the Week material, but it does star the incomparable Bea Arthur (""The Golden Girls"").  Fans of Ms. Arthur will really enjoy this one.

Widowed driving instructor Jean Miller (Bea Arthur) is pushed back into the dating scene after she decides to contact her old highschool boyfriend, Sam Morissey (Richard Kiley), now a retired doctor living in East Hampton.  Jean and Sam's rekindled romance is hampered by Jean's meddling but well-meaning friends (Barbara Barrie and Anne Francis); plus the reappearance of Sam's sexy former girlfriend Claire (Joan Van Ark).

While it doesn't break any new ground, the comic stylings of Bea Arthur and the perfect supporting cast ensure a breezy 93 minutes.  The DVD from Direct Source Special Products is nicely-priced.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1202342400,9,882,5.264285714285714

8158672,5,B000KQF702,"If you love The Golden Girls, you'll love this movie. Period. It's like one long GG episode!! Okay, maybe not as hilarious because it's lacking the other girls. Only Bea is in this movie. :-)  You'll also likely notice other Golden Girls characters like Trudy McMann, Dorothy's bff in college, who fakes her death as a prank.
About the movie. It's very touching, heartfelt and sweet. I love it. :-)",1389052800,2,398,4.685714285714286
8158673,5,B000KQF702,"Bea is so great in this movie. It is a adorable love story with comedy about two long lost lovers. The best part of the movie though is the hilarious, talented and sexy Joan van Ark! Van Ark is in a bikini and other sexy clothing items and her acting is top notch!! If you thought Joan van Ark was a good actress, wait until you see this, comedy is her thing and she is the sexiest women in the history of the world!",1383091200,,416,3.9642857142857144
8158674,3,B000KQF702,"I've always liked Richard Kiley since seeing him in ""Man of La Mancha"" in my high school days. I was deeply disappointed that Hollywood chose Peter O'Toole to star in the movie (presumably because Kiley wasn't a bankable name for moviegoers, and please don't try to tell me that ""The Little Prince"" was a consolation prize even if it's true that he beat out Sinatra for that role, as was reported at the time). I was not at all familiar with theater then and only knew about ""La Mancha"" after seeing Kiley perform the title song and ""The Impossible Dream"" on the ""Ed Sullivan Show,"" so it wasn't until decades later that I learned about his roles in ""No Strings"" and ""Kismet."" What a voice, both speaking and singing!

My admiration was cemented by his occasional TV appearances, most memorably (for me) the telefilms ""Do You Remember Love?"" (with Joanne Woodward) and ""Time to Say Goodbye"" (with Eva Marie Saint) and the ""Last Knight of Camelot"" segment of the Canadian remake of ""The Twilight Zone"" in the '80s.

All of which is a very roundabout way of explaining that I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-First-Love/dp/B000KQF702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My First Love</a>&nbsp;solely because Richard Kiley was in it. I was never a big fan of ""All in the Family"" or ""Maude,"" but it didn't hurt to have another familiar face in the lead role. And it was a treat to see Anne Francis and Joan Van Ark (in what seemed to be a change-of-pace role from what I recall) in supporting roles.

The story is fairly standard and predictable for an older-generation romance, but the leads do themselves credit by taking their roles seriously. In all honesty, I can't imagine younger audiences or people unfamiliar with Arthur and/or Kiley being able to see it through to the end. For this member of the silver generation, though, it was not at all a waste of either time or money.",1376006400,,1923,4.96583850931677

8158677,5,B000KQF702,"Of all the films and TV appearances Richard Kiley did, I have to rate ""My First Love"" as one of my favorites. He and Bea Arthur make the perfect couple and the tension between them as they work through their relationship is perfect. Richard is at his best and most enjoyable. The chemistry here is picture perfect.",1335139200,3,314,4.526315789473684
