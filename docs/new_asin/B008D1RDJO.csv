5153126,5,B008D1RDJO,"As a fan of the Dragonball and Dragonball Z manga, DBZ Kai is a really nice addition to my collection. While I can appreciate the original for its own sake, this is the version I go to when I just wanna watch some of the story and not take up too much time. For those who know the original Japanese music inside and out, the music placement in Kai is a little weird, but if you can get past that it's fun to watch. The English voice acting is hugely improved upon compared to the American version of the original DBZ as well. Give it a shot!",1359331200,,541,4.065420560747664
5153127,5,B008D1RDJO,"This is my favorite DBZ Kai season out to date!

This Review Will First talk about the packaging/contents, then thoughts on actual film.

Packaging:
This came from amazon in a small brown cardboard envelope type package. I would say its pretty safe from damage because the contents when opened were not crushed and was wrapped in plastic to protect from scratches. When I removed the plastic wrap, I noticed that the case comes in a sleeve that has the exact case art on it. I don't understand why it has the exact same print on the sleeve as it does on the case but it's okay, the sleeve still adds a nice quality look to it. When opening the case I found a DBZ Game ad, and a survey. The case is see through so you can read the episode list printed on the back of the case cover paper. And Of course the four disks.

Film:
If you've watched or heard about the kai, you know it has been refined, shorten, and re voiced. I think the characters sound just as good as the originals. There is some mild language but nothing to offensive. The new animation looks great, especially in blu-ray. It doesn't play in full/wide screen, atleast not by default. What I mean by this is that the aspect ratio looks like it's in 4:3. Im not sure if you can change this, I haven't messed around in the settings.

Overall though If your looking to watch some of those episodes from when you were a kid, or watching them from the first time, its a good idea to pick this up. Less filler and more action!! Dont be counfused, less filler doesn't mean small amount of content. Lots of time spent watching this season!",1359072000,4,1596,4.345637583892618
5153128,4,B008D1RDJO,"I'll keep this as short as possible. This is advertised as 16:9. It is not. It's in 4:3 format with black bars on the sides. Resolution is crisp and audio is phenomenal. These are also the uncut versions with the occasional cursing and almost all of the blood and ""gore"" from the original version of the series. This ""season"" starts off when Goku kills Frieza and ends when Cell attains his perfect form (just to clarify.) Be warned, watching this season will make you want to buy the next one.",1357776000,6,494,4.5

Hated the original English dub, but this new version the voices are spot on. They did an amazing job with the audio and video edeting. Love how they cut out a lot of dump scenes where there just staring at each other and not doing anything besides looking consediting. Also this version has blood and gore (not overdone).

5153135,2,B008D1RDJO,"I actually love the DBZ Kai series. The only reason I gave this particular DBZ Kai season 3 episodes 53 thru 77 a two star rating. Is because it was purchased as a gift for a twelve year old Autistic boy who loves the show as well. However, once he got to the fourth disk in the set containing episodes 74 thru 77 it was completely blank.  We tried to play it in every Blue-ray Player in the house to no avail, all the disk would say is loading...",1476316800,,447,4.022471910112359

5153150,5,B008D1RDJO,I was very skeptical about kai since I grew up watching Dragon Ball z on cartoon network and buying uncut vhs. Kai is great though it's dragon ball z without the fillers just like everyone else has probably said. If your familiar with the series some of it feels really fast forwarded like the trunks saga and they cut some of the fillers that build up the dramatic scenes which sucks; but overall it's really good. If you can get over some of the different voice overs and the music change you'll love the new version,1424217600,,518,4.40625

5153160,5,B008D1RDJO,"Dragon Ball Z Kai: Season Three [Blu-ray] comes with 4 disc. Episodes 53-77. Quality and Sound are superb the Aspect ration is 4:3 the original ration Dragon Ball/Z/GT was first aired. Lots of action, lot of the filler that the original dub had is gone. The picture quality is good. However, sometimes it switches from the new Kai scenes to the original which is no big deal since it still looks better than the original. The Japanese BGM is only on here no Bruce Faulconer Music which sucks but didn't bother me. 1080p native on Blu-Ray. All Disc come with English dub with reedited dialogue also Japanese with sub titles and in my opinion this version has a better Dub than the original dialogue. Its uncut with blood and some curse words which is cool see since the original did not have that. Not 100% true to the manga but close. Really recommend to anyone has is a fan of DBZ to give Kai a try. Even myself a long time fan since watching as a kid back on Toonami was bit spectacle about Kai.

5153163,5,B008D1RDJO,"I decided to pick up this entire series. The first 2 seasons had some crudely redrawn scenes and some annoying bouts of censorship (1 bloody scene would be censored, but another equally as bad wasn't). This particular boxset seemed to keep everything in tact, and the redrawn scenes were much fewer in number and done better. Not sure what caused the increase in overall quality so suddenly, but I appreciate it. It was the most enjoyable season to watch yet, which is saying something considering the freiza saga is my favorite. Only bad part of the actual episodes is they kept in the nicktoons edit during the 18 vs vegeta fight for some reason..the one where the dude shouts ""my truck"" when he dies instead of letting you assume he dies(Which it is shown for certain he does in the manga, i literally went to my manga collection and read the chapter to be sure).

My biggest gripe with this blu ray is that they replaced the opening and ending songs with poorly performed english covers. This particular boxset's opening actually hurts my ears, it's legitimately really bad. Vic's version was the only decent one out of the bunch, but with the new season releases, they didn't see fit to have his version be the go-to.",1369785600,,1222,4.657407407407407

5153165,5,B008D1RDJO,"So surprising how much more action Kai has and the amount of detail you can see on bluray is unreal, I can't turn it off.  Season 4 here I come!",1367798400,,144,3.8
5153166,4,B008D1RDJO,"I'm fairly new to Dragon Ball Z and so I was particularly interested by the Kai series - no filler and more action. And so far it hasn't let me down. It 'cuts right to the chase', with no time wasted on the less interesting, drawn out, parts of the series.
As far as I know, play back is only available 4:3 aspect ratio, also, not all shots have been re-rendered, with the majority of scenes being in the original formate. I personally was slightly disappointed by this, I would have appreciated it more if it had all been done in a fully re-mastered style, with the option to watch the original - for the more nostalgic of viewers. Other than this though the picture is crisp and audio sharp. There have been a couple voice-actor changes (most notably: Kid Gohan, Bulma, Narrator and Android 18) but nothing 'outrageous'. Goku is still voiced by Sean Schemmel and Vegeta by Chris Sabat.
So overall this is definitely a 'buy' for Dragon Ball Z fans, because at the end of the day, it's still Dragon Ball Z, just without the 'boring' stuff and a couple minor voice changes.
P.S I bought this from Amazon.com (American site) and I live in Australia, but it still works in my Australia Playstation 3. The description says it is only region A, but when it arrived I saw that it is also coded to region B (Europe and Australia). I am also putting it out there, that this is the case for all of the DBZ Kai seasons and Collections. (Source:[...])",1365465600,,1440,4.437735849056604
5153167,4,B008D1RDJO,"Once again another season, another box set, another rendition of Funimation's dub over of the original series. The 20+ episodes will scream by fast, although the pacing becomes very different compared to seasons 1 and 2, in some cases it'll feel very slow, other times it's very quick. The transition from the Android menace to Cell is almost a blink and doesn't stop until Cell absorbs his first android victim.

The musical score has been altered after the problems with the japanese composer being busted for infringment and while the japanese tv version didn't replace the new score until the end of the series run, the english version redid the audio track with the original musical score instead. So those of you who were enjoying the new style that appeared thru much of season 1 and bits of Season 2, I'm sorry, but that's what happens when you copy other musical scores without permission, you get to resign your comission from Toei! However the original score has no problems in keeping up with the new edit and less filler of Kai.

The voice actors from much of the original dub still return to reprise their roles so your favorite voices are still around from as far back as the late 90's early 2000!

Overall, it's the same series, less filler though, but performances are still fantastic and still fun to watch!",1364515200,9,1325,4.7272727272727275

Previously in Dragon Ball Z Kai the Z fighters just escaped planet Namek, leaving Goku to finish fighting Frieza.

This season picks up at the very end of the Frieza fight on Namek which is a fine start to a season but means Season 2 ended at a bad spot. Season 3 will continue to introduce new characters such as Trunks, androids 16, 17, and 18 as well Cell and follow the Z fighters in their fight against these androids and ultimately Cell. This season essentially covers the Android saga.

The episode cut for Season 3 is self contained story wise though last season was cut off one episode short so the first episode is the conclusion to the Namek saga. After that there is a single episode to deal with the aftermath and generally set up the characters before throwing in a returning foe, Frieza 2.0 though this is only used to introduce the new character Trunks. The rest of the Season revolves around a new threat, the Androids.

While it can be difficult to determine exact story arc start and end points, I would state that Season 3 perfectly sets up the Cell saga, therein ending the Android saga, though the Androids continue to play a part into Season 4.

Suffice it to say, Season 3, after the first episode starts very strong and has a better fight vs. story ratio than Season 2 and manages this time to build up to an end that makes you want to start Season 4 right away without feeling cheap.

Speaking of fighting, action is a good 50/50 here but its better distributed. You will very rarely go more than a single episode without a fight scene but no single fight lasts nearly as long as the fights in Season 2 did and thats a good thing.

Not only is it a good ratio but the fighting has really improved. Episode 73s fight between Piccolo and Android 17 in particular is a stand out and is my favorite fight to-date by a large margin. I was actually really surprised by the choreography of it. The fight is not just flashing punches like we see so many times but instead almost a barfight or brawl. It has lots of grabbing and throwing, with choreographed counters and some trick moves that pay off really well. This single fight has really stood above every single other fight to date in Dragon Ball Z Kai and is thankfully not broken into multiple episodes but instead contained perfectly in a very good episode.

And these androids the Z fighters are fighting are a welcome change in enemy. They are not out to take over the universe and are therefore a bit more gray as far as enemies come which is nice.

While I enjoy the Androids as a new enemy I do feel that they might be the only part that drags in this season, though this is only mildly nitpicking. See, Android 16, 17, and 18 are searching for Goku and this part might have been dragged on slightly too long in that I felt perhaps it had a bit too much screen time. In the end it provided very little in character development for how much screen time it got. Of course not going back to their search would have left them forgotten about for a good portion of the season which would be its own negative. Overall Id say it was fine, certainly better than Season 2.

As for the Kai specific additions to the animation I felt there was about just as much as there was in previous seasons, but the stood out less here. It seemed slightly less plain and instead blended better into the original art style.

Overall I must say that this has been my favorite season to date, followed by Season 1 and then 2. It has my favorite episode by far, better fighting, interesting and developed characters, a very intriguing story that continued to have enjoyable pacing changes at just the right moments. Additionally, Piccolo and even Tien continue to be relevant in fights, lessening the Saiyan only situations DBZ tends to lean toward.",1509840000,,4214,4.402313624678663
