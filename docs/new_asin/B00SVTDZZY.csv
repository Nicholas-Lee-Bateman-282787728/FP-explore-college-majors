8699468,1,B00SVTDZZY,"This has to be one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen.  I wasn't even sure it was going to be in English until a few minutes into the film when the first bit of dialogue happens as the background music is all sung in Portuguese.  The worms do speak English, but really it's not great writing.  The main character worm is completely unlikeable, he's a social loser type rich kid worm who tries to buy friends by getting his overprotective mother to buy him the latest fad or top piece of sporting equipment which he thinks will impress the other worm kids, it of course doesn't.  Even though he should know what its like to be excluded, when an even lower on the social scale worm who also hangs around the group wants to hang out with him, he rudely tells him to get lost.  Trying to impress the other worm kids with a sling shot his favourite stunt worm uses the unlikable worm and the worm he doesn't want to be friends with end up in the scoop of a digger and in the back of a truck on the surface.  There they encounter zombie worms and a villain trying to turn the entire worm population into his zombie minions as revenge for the way they treat his kind.

The animation is very average.  For some reason the worms are drawn to look like cheap action toys of themselves where you can see all the join lines including ones holding their snout mouths to their face, so they end up looking like they are wearing those masks airlines give you to block out the light on planes if you want to sleep.  The story isn't great, nor does it even really hold your attention. There are cars, streets, houses, mobile phones and basically the world underground is the same as the human world above, in fact the mother of the worm doesn't want her son to get dirty.  It was so boring I fell asleep near the end and couldn't be bothered skipping back to see what happened.",1458086400,,1869,4.299145299145299

8699471,2,B00SVTDZZY,"A group of worm children who like to play ""worm ball"" (something similar to rollerball but without James Caan) find themselves on the surface fighting against a Rolli Polli who can hypnotize worms and turn them into zombies. The worms have been using the Rolli Polli as the ball in their games, so you can understand the revenge factor. They use discarded toys and items in the surface world.

The characters just didn't grab me. Junior is the center of the film. He is the kid that has the rich parents and neat toys, but he doesn't fit in. His mom doesn't want him to get dirty, perhaps the funniest aspect of the film. This is a Brazilian made film. It is in English except for some of the soundtrack songs.  Go watch Disney's ""Descendants"" or ""Strange Magic"" instead.",1438992000,,771,4.539568345323741
