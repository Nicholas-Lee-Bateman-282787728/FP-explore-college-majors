5114329,5,B007Y5ZTGY,The plot and the unfolding of the story is very logical with a surprising end; I was delighted to have seen it.,1346457600,,111,4.090909090909091
5114330,4,B007Y5ZTGY,"A crime & action thriller with a twist is unusual for Bollywood and even though similar storylines have been done in the past in Western film I thought that they did a nice job of scripting this one. Except, some parts seemed a little too rushed and implausible while other parts were needlessly drawn out. But, most importantly, we needed a more in-depth look into our main character and her background, especially how she acquired her expertise.",1346284800,,447,4.818181818181818
5114331,5,B007Y5ZTGY,"Whilst the current trend in Bollywood consists of unimaginative remakes and no-brainer sequels, 'Kahaani' comes as a huge relief!

Not only is it a brave attempt in giving us a heavily pregnant lead heroine in the day and age of the obligatory Sheila's and Munni's, but it also manages to hook the audience with that 1 magical, key ingredient - SCRIPT!

This superbly written film packs in enough layers and twists to keep the audience involved.
It's compelling cinema, which displays glimmers of warmth one moment, jaw dropping revelations the next!

A kahaani this enjoyable, demands to be seen, to be experienced, as giving away any plot devices would be unforgivable.

Director Sujoy Ghosh deserves to be applauded for not compromising on his conviction by sparing us the compulsory item song or random special appearance by a `star' to draw in the crowds.

Instead, the film relies on its solid script, gripping narrative and arresting performance by the supremely talented Vidya Balan!

Although essentially a female centric film, it doesn't take away from the sharp performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan or the sensitive, thoughtful character, Rana, played by Parambrata Chatterjee.

The crisp cinematography and background score also work in giving this thriller that extra edge.

Another huge bonus is the haunting rendition of `Ekla Chalo Re' by Amitabh Bachchan, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.

Strongly recommended!",1340841600,10,1452,5.278260869565218
5114332,5,B007Y5ZTGY,I'm Very Happy When I Ordered My Movie Kahaani (2012) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema Dvd)and Watched It @ Home. This Film Has Suspence Thru Out And A Few Tear Shedding Momments But Overall Excellent. I Highly Recommend This Film!,1336176000,2,244,4.6976744186046515
5114333,5,B007Y5ZTGY,"Where to start? I just finished watching this movie, and I'm still trying to put into words my experience. I mean forget about the brilliant directing, wonderful script, excellent choice of choosing Kolkata as not just a city but as a living entity; the mere presence of Vidya Balan is worth giving this movie a view. From the very beginning, this movie gets a hold of you in such a way that it gets very hard to pause the video any do anything else. Kolkata is portrayed as it should be - big, confusing, poverty ridden... rich, caring, colorful; the list goes on. The city is used a wonderful back drop to the actual story of helplessness, confusion, being lost, and sadness. *I am at the lack of words again.. Its very hard to put into a sentence(s) the genius that has been achieved here*. Again, the acting capabilities of Vidya Balan cannot be praised enough. We saw glimpses of it in Ishqiya, were treated with a full featured trailer in No One Killed Jessica, got a healthy serving in The Dirty Picture, but this movie is over flowing with evidence of that gift given to Balan. Not a dull moment when Balan's on screen. It is she and she alone that has pushed this film to #45 on the IMDB's list of Top 50 Thrillers (3 stops below Blade Runner). And the ending..... speechless.... You need to watch it yourself to believe it.

Over all, this movie has become one of my all time favorites. I will really be looking forward to more screen miracles from the director Sujoy Ghosh; Balan needs no mentioning, it goes without saying.

Btw, no matter what... I've definitely going to Kolkata the next time I go to India...",1335139200,9,1623,4.498305084745763
5114334,5,B007Y5ZTGY,"This has happened to me only a few times in my entire life that I went to watch a film that no one wrote a lot about, with zilch expectations but right from the first reel I was glued and struck by the awesomeness that a well made film can truly create. Kahaani is one of such films and interestingly stars Vidya Balan, who seems to have discovered a magic ability to find stories that not only work but create box office magic i.e. Paa, Ishqiya, No One Killed Jessica and Dirty Picture. A true suspense movie with many twists and turns is a story about seven month pregnant Vidya Bagchi ( Vidya Balan) who arrives in Kolkata from London to look for her missing husband Arnab Bagchi ( Indraneil Sengupta). She reaches a dead end everywhere she looks as there is no absolute trace that her husband ever existed. The cops advise her to go back. However rookie sub-inspector Rana ( Parabrata Chattopadhyay) assist her in finding her husband. As the viewer gets sucked in this search with Vidya, you will also find the city of Kolkata riveting as I did. It serves as a great background and is beautifully photographed by Setu with an outstanding background score by Clinton Cerejo. The opening scenes are terrific and do not miss it, (I saw this film in a theater and I noticed that people entering the theater, after these scenes has passed. I wondered if they were able to figure out the entire film because these are crucial scenes) The second half is a little raw but the last 20 minutes are mind blowing and sensational as the ending is quite unexpected. The writing and the direction are extraordinary, Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala's, story and Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas , screenplay have done a fantastic job. Vidya Balan notches up yet another brilliant performance, her eyes have the right amount of intensity and vulnerability to deliver this difficult role. There are so many characters and some of them are herrings but all a crucial part of this film. Kahaani is a story that is well told and interesting and watching with a amazing script which delivers surprises and shocks. Mystery fans celebrate, after a hiatus a truly rocking film celebrates this genre. Five stars. 3/21/2012",1334016000,17,2192,4.666666666666667

5114340,4,B007Y5ZTGY,"Two years after a terrible incident in the Kolkata subway, a pregnant woman named Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) arrives from London and visits the police station looking for her missing husband. A young police officer Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee) is helpful, but there is no trace of her Bengali husband who she claims must be working in this city. A seemingly routine case of a missing person becomes complicated and even deadly as they continue to investigate.

Deftly directed by Sujoy Ghosh, Kahaani is a slick Indian thriller centering on this heroine determined to find out what happened to her husband. The fast-paced film offers enough thrills and entertainment to satisfy the most jaded fans of the genre, with Vidya Balans strong performance as he unique protagonist and the vivid depictions of the busy city streets of Kolkata, where filming took place.

It is obvious that the films heroine and story has something to do with the Hindi mythology which I do not know. Even so, I enjoyed myself watching the two-hour non-stop thrill ride.",1445040000,,1045,5.0

5114343,5,B007Y5ZTGY,"This is a most excellent film, for any country, any genre. It is engaging and suspenseful from start to finish, clever and very satisfying. All the actors did a beautiful job, especially the incredibly convincing Vidya Balan in the title role. Can't wait to watch it again soon, now that I know all the secrets. Unfortunately THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE IS BADLY MARRED by producer Shemaroo's logo/watermark APPEARING IN LARGE CAPITAL LETTERS ON EVERY FRAME OF THE FILM. This is very distracting and inappropriate. It is exactly like your company purchasing a Van Gogh painting and then painting your company logo on the face of it to shamelessly advertise yourself at the expense of the work of art. This film (like Queen--same problem) is fine art and Shemaroo has spoiled it. I complained to them at customerservice@shemaroo.com and I urge you to do the same. Maybe if enough people complain they'll stop this inappropriate and unnecessary practice.",1439251200,3,947,5.076923076923077

5114353,5,B007Y5ZTGY,"We first see Kahaani at an airport where she catches a cab. The driver is surprised that she wants to go directly to the police station instead of a hotel. She wants the police to help her find her husband, who left London and was never heard from again. One policeman takes pity on her and helps when he is off duty.

When she rents a derelict room, we watch it improve: it becomes cleaner, tidier, more livable. That cute little neighbor boy notices too. We see what a charmer Kahaani can be, every time someone is offended, she turns on the charm and immediately soothes hurt feelings.

As she and that policeman gather information, we get the sense that they are closing in on an answer, but we also realize that there is a larger mystery here. One of the men the police interview tells them that he himself did the training so he is positive that they will never find the mysterious villain.

We have at least three people to root for: the policeman, the woman looking for her husband, and that little boy.
