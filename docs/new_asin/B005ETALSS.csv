8469003,4,B005ETALSS,"This is a good story of three brothers, their mother, and a beautiful woman who wants to marry the older brother and he her, but he says that there are things he needs to do before they wed. Each brother is different. Fred MacMurray is the oldest. He is the thinker of the group. He is well-respected by others because of his advice. Dean Stockwell is somewhat wild. He likes to train wild horses. Jeffrey Hunter is the mommy-boy, even though he does not like being so. Their mom treats him as if he is very soft, not fit for ranching. She wants him to come with her to an eastern city and live a quiet life. She complicates the lives of her three sons. So, too, does the woman who MacMurray asked to wait. She falls in love with Hunter.",1514678400,,737,4.23404255319149

8469005,3,B005ETALSS,"The movie itself deserves 4 or 5 star rating, good cast, interesting story line - the ending was hokey, but otherwise enjoyed watching and would watch again.  Unfortunately, the DVD quality is quite poor.  Audio is of poor quality throughout, and a times the video is blurry and jumpy.  Hopefully a better release is forthcoming.",1434672000,3,329,4.945454545454545
8469006,4,B005ETALSS,Just remembered....I read years ago....that actor JAMES DEAN was suppose to get the role in this western..but of course he died two years early. That role was..DEAN STOCKWELL'S..role..who at the time looked a lot like Dean. This western was very well done. DO add it to your western classics. Jeff Hunter(KING OF KINGS)always  does a great acting job. He was a very close friend to ROBERT WAGNER(TRUE STORY OF JESSE JAMES)fame. FRED MacMURRAY..always a very strong actor in all of his roles. DEAN STOCKWELL..is the only actor(now age 73) alive today from this western.,1421539200,,568,5.042553191489362

Directed by Abner Biberman

Having inherited a huge cattle ranch from his late father, Will Keough (Fred MacMurray) wants nothing more than to tend to his work and live in peace, but this is made impossible by the tense situation in his own household. Will's two younger brothers, Bless (Jeffrey Hunter) and Hade (Dean Stockwell), are as different as night and day: Bless, convinced that he was responsible for the death of his father, refuses to use a gun, and is thus branded a coward; conversely, Hade is wild and reckless, literally an accident waiting to happen. Exacerbating the situation is the brothers' grim and merciless mother (Josephine Hutchinson), who has instilled most of Bless' guilt feelings, and Will's sweetheart Aud Niven (Janice Rule), who finds herself drawn to the sensitive Bless. Ultimately, there will have to be a showdown...but who among the Keogh siblings will survive?

Good cast, with some wonderful dialogue.

Fred MacMurray shows why he is the versatile and good actor that he is.

8469012,5,B005ETALSS,"Although he is usually associated with the long-running TV series, ""My Three Sons"" or some Disney productions, Fred MacMurray was a gifted actor in spurs and chaps, as well. He starred in a number of solid Westerns, starting with THE TEXAS RANGERS in 1936 and continuing through the late 1950s with several underappreciated vehicles, including the fine GUN FOR A COWARD. This well-cast Universal release (1956) features MacMurray with Jeffrey Hunter and Dean Stockwell as his brothers. Also in the cast are Chill Wills--always a pleasure to see him--and a number of Universal regulars. In some ways this film resembles GUNMAN'S WALK, with its interplay and conflict between brothers. MacMurray is solid as the elder brother Will Keough trying to keep his unruly family together, while romancing a gal who actually loves a younger brother (Hunter). Add to this some nasty rustlers and nestors, and you have all the ingredients for a solid hour and a half Western entertainment. Great Technicolor print; DVD-R format. No adds ons, but that's okay---GUN FOR A COWARD is fine little Westerns. Recommended (may we hope for more from the Universal-International vaults?).",1320883200,2,1165,5.235294117647059
