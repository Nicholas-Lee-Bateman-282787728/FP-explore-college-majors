3643393,4,B001HPP41W,My 2 grandsons loved this Movie. After seeing the recent Movie playing now they enjoyed seeing this one at home! I'm now looking for some more of the originals like the first showing on TV of the Chipettes.,1266192000,,206,4.447368421052632
3643394,4,B001HPP41W,"I pretty much agree with the other reviewers of what episodes should of been on the disc. The very first ones where the Chipettes first appeared in the series would of been nice. The one of their origin should of been one of them. The episode of them getting adopted by Miss Miller would of been interesting. And there are many more, it could of had easily as many as ""The Alvin Edition"" DVD. Well, I guess we can hope they can have a volume 2 of this to make it up.",1261353600,9,466,4.076086956521739
3643395,5,B001HPP41W,"This is a fantastic collection of episodes featuring the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor) from the 1980s ""Alvin & The Chipmunks"" animated series . . . but hopefully Paramount and Bagdasarian Productions will heed the call of Chipmunk fans and release a second set of episodes starring the Chipettes, namely those that haven't aired in years.

The omission of the Chipettes' Story (an episode about their origins in Australia) is especially glaring.  I'd also like to see the following episodes in a future Chipettes DVD (perhaps to coincide with the upcoming Chipmunks Squeakel, which features the Chipettes):

Quarterback in Curlers
Queen of the High school Ballroom
Hearts and Flowers
The Legend of Sleeping Brittany
The Princess and the Pig

Hope to see these on DVD soon!!!",1246924800,17,788,5.23015873015873
3643396,4,B001HPP41W,I bought this at Target so I knew which episodes I was getting.  I thoroughly enjoy it.  There are 2 things I'd change 1 captioning the hard of hearing should have a right to hear it clearly without blasting the tv.  2 a dvd of the origins of the Chippettes would be awesome as well as maybe that one when social services discovers them and they end up adopted by miss miler  plus there are so many really great  Chippetes episodes.  a 2-4 disc set would be awesome.  I know I'd buy it post haste.,1244419200,,497,4.168421052631579
3643397,4,B001HPP41W,"Oh this makes me mad. I figure when I order this, ""No doubt it will have the very first episode The Chipettes and of coarse The Chipette's Story!"" Hence the title 'The Chipettes' Those are practically their episodes. But when I get the DVD I was slightly disappointed. The only episodes were ones that had the chipettes in them. Even though the Chipettes had pretty big rolls in these 6 episodes i still just don't like that they didn't include these two episodes that were on The Chipettes. But besides that this is a good laugh filled collection. And would be a good addition to any chipmunk collection.",1234828800,10,605,4.611111111111111

8309306,4,B001HPP41W,"If you children loved the new Chipmunk movie staring the adorable Chipettes, then this will be a great addition to their dvd collection.  I believe these may have been done in the early 90's, but they are timely and fun and as cute as their modern counterparts.",1268611200,2,261,4.553191489361702
