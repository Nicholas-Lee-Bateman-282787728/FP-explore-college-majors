What you won't hear at the end of any future State of the Union speech is ""and God Bless Bloc Party"". But damn if Bloc Party and its legions of fans aren't chanting it. Released on the heels of ""Silent Alarm"" this DVD follows the band with a documentary and also a live show at Belfort. It's intriguing to see the personas behind the music. Fun-filled and choking with great dancey electronic rock, ""God Bless Bloc Party"" is a must-have for any true fan.",1139011200,,490,4.568181818181818
8100996,5,B000CR7CO8,"I like Bloc Party Alot and this DVD is a perfect add to your collection if your a big BP fan like i am!
in this DVD, they play a show at L.A. in The El Rey Theatre which was there first time playing in American they were a little nervous filming this documentary but non the less its a great DVD live performaces at BelFort, France this is a 2005 DVD but the only thing I didn't like was they played This Modern Love at the end of the show which was used for the credits and it didn't really show them playing just the crowed and slowed downed the camera puasing at the crowed with the credits going... but I enjoyed every thing else pease get this if you like Bloc Party you won't regert for real though!!",1298678400,,706,4.05
8100997,2,B000CR7CO8,"I bought this for very little cash and I still felt it was a huge waste of money.  It is NOT a documentary in my opinion.  It's not even as good as a nice, solid 15 min band interview.  It looks like the footage of a 12 year old child trying to make a documentary.  The only positive about this DVD is learning that Bloc Party are excellent live!",1278115200,,346,3.971014492753623
8100998,2,B000CR7CO8,"I really like Bloc Party's music and have all their albums, but this is, by far, the worst documentary I've ever watched.  I'd say, get it for the live performances if you want, but these aren't even the best (crowd is very unenthusiastic and I'm sure Bloc Party messes up a few times here and there), but I understand this was fairly early on in their career as a band, so its cool.  To give you an idea of the documentary, the interviewer on the documentary asks Kele, ""No offense, but I notice you stutter a lot.  Was that difficult for you growing up?""  I don't see how he answered that question so calmly.  I'd say buy this real cheap if you absolutely have to have it.",1239408000,,674,4.275590551181103
8100999,3,B000CR7CO8,"This DVD is over so quick it leaves your head spinning.

I saw these guys live twice on this first album, and I know they play more than this.

I suppose not giving you much just makes you want to see more. If that was the plan, it worked.",1226361600,,239,3.857142857142857
8101000,2,B000CR7CO8,"first off, im all for bloc party ! but this dvd sucks!!! there's only 4 live performances and a long boring documantary !  and that about sums it up.  I only hope weekend in the city dvd is alot better.",1183593600,2,202,4.025
8101001,3,B000CR7CO8,God bless bloc party was average I thought it was good to see some live footage of one of the best bands around today they didn't seem to live up to the hype of there live performances i thought the vocals at time were pretty awful and the band didn't seem bothered about talkin to the people making the documentary throughout still though worth buying if your a bloc party fan until something better comes out,1173916800,,410,4.407894736842105
8101002,1,B000CR7CO8,"The ""documentary"" was horrible! It pretty much consisted of the camera following the band around outside or in a cab with songs from the band playing. The few times the band members spoke during the documentary they seemed like they were being forced to talk at gunpoint or something. The video coverage of the concert in LA was shoddy. The only redeeming thing about the dvd is the four or five song set played on the second portion of the dvd. Overall I was a very dissapointed Bloc Party fan!",1141344000,7,495,4.511111111111111
8101003,4,B000CR7CO8,"When I heard their first single ""this modern love"", I knew thewould be a great band... when I noticed the release of this DVD, I was very excited. Definetely is a collector's piece, maybe the quality is not the proper but is the angle stone of their success, I'm very glad to have this DVD and be part of them. As a fan, this DVD is awesome!",1141084800,,341,4.104477611940299
8101004,4,B000CR7CO8,"I was very excited when I heard this was coming out, because Bloc Party is one of my new favorite bands.  I love ""behind the scenes"" footage, but what was available on this DVD was very limited.  I think the band is a little camera shy.  The concert footage, however, is amazing!  The sound is great, the band was on fire, and I don't think a smile ever left the singers face.  I would have liked to learn more about the band, but it was well worth to see the band perform live.",1140998400,,478,4.096774193548387
8101005,4,B000CR7CO8,"I was very suprised when I found out that Bloc Party came out with a dvd. They are still a rather small indie band and barely known in the states. I'm a big fan of them, but have never seen them live so I was a little unsure.

The dvd menu has two features: documentary and their live show in Belfort, France. The documentary is a mix of band interviews and live clippings from a LA venue. The LA show was good live footage, and they sounded excellent however the interviews with the band were dull and pointless. Bloc Party isn't as interesting as they are on stage; I don't blame the band entirely-it is the journalists/interviewer's questioning.

If you like live footage and don't care as much about getting to know the band personally then this dvd is perfect. I was happy regardless because Bloc Party rocks.",1140393600,3,814,4.493243243243243
