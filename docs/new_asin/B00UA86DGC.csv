7031856,4,B00UA86DGC,"Unexpectedly enjoyable stage presentation of The Taming of the Shrew - Shakespeare's Globe. It was energetic and seeing it performed on stage was very different than watching ""the movie"" versions available.",1438992000,4,206,5.67741935483871
7031857,5,B00UA86DGC,"Shakespeare fans--rejoice!  This has to be the BEST performance ever of what some consider a ""difficult"" play.  It's presented as a delightful romp with an inspired cast, and as always we discover who the REAL shrew is by the end of the story.  These Globe Theatre productions have become my favorite performances, because the cast is brilliant and the whole play is presented without feeling over long.  It's also a big plus that they feature period music, both as background as well as a song that's woven throughout the play.  The audience is involved, as the actors often speak directly to them, which adds to the enjoyment.  Great costumes, perfect props, and Shakespeare's amazing words--well worth your time!  Highly recommended.",1432771200,13,736,5.083333333333333
7031858,5,B00UA86DGC,"Strong production that is well worth your time and consideration to be sure. Just don't expect assistance with the language, should you need any, from Kultur. Again with this wave of releases they have failed to include subtitles even though they are available with the Opus Arte offering available from amazon.co.uk (same cover, same content). My advice is if you want this release (you should) but would also enjoy to have the option for subtitles then buy the all region UK edition. Price is about the same, shipping price is low, and it still arrives at your door quickly.",1425600000,15,576,4.828282828282828

8704947,5,B00UA86DGC,"Very well done performance, some delightful surprises and shocks, be on the lookout for the codpiece (and nothing else) in the wedding scene, though! The best recorded stage performance of a production I've seen.",1512259200,,212,5.264705882352941
8704948,4,B00UA86DGC,"Its hard to put the Bard on film.  I prefer live stage to film.  Its very tough to put stage on film.  The Globe series does a really good job of adapting their plays to the screen.  I love the casting here, plenty of chemistry, and the staging is spot on and not over done.  The dvd production values are adequate but won't make you forget that you're looking at a screen.  Is a great teaser to get you to grab a flight and see it at the theater in London.  This is definitely one to buy.",1495411200,,489,3.979381443298969

8704951,5,B00UA86DGC,Watched it  over the weekend. Truly a great cast especially Petruccio. I have come to expect a light and fun comedy touch from the Gobe theatre productions. This did not disappoint. My only regret is not being able to see it in person live.,1459728000,3,240,4.454545454545454
8704952,5,B00UA86DGC,"Absolutely loved it! The DVD arrived in perfect condition and arrived earlier than expected. The play itself is timeless, and we love the Globe Theater productions.",1454112000,2,164,5.346153846153846
8704953,1,B00UA86DGC,"The first disc is labeled 'Taming of the Shrew', but is actually 'As You Like It'.

That said, the first few minutes of disc 2 (which is 'Taming of the Shrew') reminded me how sophomoric Globe productions are prone to be.",1448582400,,221,4.390243902439025
