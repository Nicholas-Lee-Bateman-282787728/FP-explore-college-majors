6014584,5,B00FM4S7AO,"I have loved this show since it aired.
Amazing wit, one-liners and over-the-top acting that I adore.  Eddie Izzard is great as an eccentric villain, as is Eric Roberts.  Max Williams though, who plays the main character Gunther Vogler, is definitely a scene-stealer with Kate Kelton as his girlfriend. She, hands- down, has one of the funniest fighting scenes I have ever seen in my life and I have watched over a ton of action and martial arts films.
I swear, the script is so well written and the characters so much fun to watch, I will always be surprised that I did not get to see more.
I say the line about Mickey Rourke pretty often, and I have Hello Baby as my ringtone and will never change it.
People who do not get this show would not get along with me because we have completely different senses of humor.",1408924800,,816,4.397350993377484
6014585,5,B00FM4S7AO,"Hands down the best cop series since ""Sledge Hammer.""

Humor is dark and dry.  Like cheap instant coffee.  Sets have a noir feel.  Izzard is completely batshit.

Watch this.  Buy a copy for your friends and make them watch it.  Repeat as necessary.",1403049600,2,248,4.627906976744186
6014586,5,B00FM4S7AO,Eddie Izzard and Eric Roberts as two main cast members for season one. I'm already there. Max Williams does an excellent job through out the whole series. I could only hope they come out with more.,1400457600,2,197,4.5
6014587,5,B00FM4S7AO,"Bullet in the Face is a dark satire from the mastermind behind the crazy classic TV show Sledge Hammer!  Freed from the constraints of 80s television Alan Spencer went wild and offered the world a super violent and hyper stylized take on film noir and graphic novels.  Think of it as Luc Besson meets Mel Brooks with a side order of Tarantino.  Unlike other comedies, particularly recent sorry spoofs, Spencer knows his tropes because hes one of the industrys top script doctors.  The plot of this series features wonderful twists and turns.  The story is compelling while the jokes are outrageous.  Its remarkable how much production got crammed into a limited budget and Spencers entertaining commentaries reveal his tricks of the trades to get more bang for the buck -- such as making Eddie Izzards character agoraphobic so all his scenes could be shot in one location.  The show was also shot in Canada which works for the look, despite Spencers implication that the director didn't necessarily understand comedy at all.  IFC apparently chickened out by airing this whole series over two nights, which made no sense, while favoring other low rated tripe that stays at the bottom of the ratings barrel.  Nevertheless audiences responded and Shout Factory has done a stellar job in making sure this show achieves cult status.  Bravo to Alan Spencer for not playing it safe.  Trust him, he knows what hes doing.",1393718400,,1412,4.915611814345992
6014588,1,B00FM4S7AO,"one star and i am the first to not like the movie that is a shock to me because it was not worth the power to run the tv, ok this was a total and I mean total miss for me. I made it to about 40 min in before I had to turn it off. the way way over the top acting and the main guy a german killer/cop was a very bad idea. I cant tell you much because I had to turn it off.",1393632000,,370,3.264367816091954
6014589,5,B00FM4S7AO,"Legendary writer Alan Spencer succeeds once again!  This series is a must see!  Dark and twisted laugh out loud moments brought to life by an extremely talented cast. Spencer makes it impossible to not watch the series straight through, as you are dying to see what happens next.  WARNING: The end of the series will be followed by depression.",1390780800,5,343,4.779661016949152
6014590,5,B00FM4S7AO,"Although Bullet in the Face (BITF) is a comedy about a mob war, its better characterized as a romantic comedy about the dating habits of criminals.  Imagine it as somewhat like the TV series Melrose Place, only starring sociopaths.

BITF has a funny, intelligent script by the great comedy writer/producer Alan Spencer.  The script is creative and full of surprising plot twists and turns.  And the characters are written as real people, which is another big plus.

The cast is superb and they deliver the goods.  In particular, Eddie Izzard, Eric Roberts and Kate Kelton give outstanding performances.  Eric Roberts, who is best known for dramatic roles, shows a deft comic touch.  But Eddie Izzard and Kate Kelton steal the show.

This is that rare comedy series that is actually funny.  You won't be bored.

The audio commentaries done for all the episodes by Alan Spencer were excellent.  His comments were entertaining, insightful and informative.  For example, he explains what a McGuffin is, notes how Eddie Izzard would make a great James Bond villain, and pronounces Eddie Izzards name correctly.",1390694400,4,1105,5.072222222222222
6014591,5,B00FM4S7AO,"...And so is it's totally, wonderfully insane creator, Alan Spencer.

I'm a tough audience, but Alan grabbed me by the you-know-whats and made me his fan with his incredible parody series SLEDGE HAMMER, and BULLET IN THE FACE revitalized the relationship.

I love everything about this irreverent, totally politically incorrect series, from Eddie Izzard's demonic sincere villainy to Max Williams sweetly sociopathic heroism. Good guys? Bad guys? Who cares? In this world - much like in our own - everyone's crazy and that's just fine.

Buy this. Watch this. And pray that Mr. Spencer's hilarious perversity returns to our screens in something even newer and better soon!",1387065600,5,671,5.252336448598131

8616851,4,B00FM4S7AO,"totally lizard brain engaging for occupying that part of the brain that wants something in between Dr. Strangelove and Ace Ventura, and it probably cost less than the opening credits to Kingsman",1462752000,,194,5.09375
8616852,5,B00FM4S7AO,"I can barely tell you how awesome this series is, because I keep laughing and missing half of the lines on the show. Have watched it twice and each time It gets better. The writing is so unexpected, and so very different from everything else you've seen. I can't tell you if the over-acting is unintentional or pure genius-but I'm leaning towards THE most pulled-together show I've ever seen. Put your thinking cap on though, because this show is Smart!",1434844800,2,453,4.675

8616854,4,B00FM4S7AO,"This is the comical slice of humorous cinema created by Alan Spencer who did the cult TV show in 1986 Sledge Hammer starring David Rasche.

This is a politically incorrect series that plays with the rougher comedy. The series is created in six parts from Canada. This is a wild over-the-top, silly, humorous piece of cinema that if you view it, it can't be forgotten.

This is an unrelenting, comical, comic book type violence, it's cheesy, uproarious and cult like establishing of a series. It's one of those series that will probably be remembered for its wild actions throughout and it's ultra comedy toward violence.

To understand what your getting into all one has to do is listen to the opening song: ""Is he good? Is he bad? A psychopath or a sexy cad?""

You are introduced to the very violent criminal and basic psychopath Gunter Vogler who's played wonderfully and comical and very violent by Max Williams. Now to fully understand the plot of this series one has to dig into their imagination and pull out all craziness.

During a robbery he is shot in the face by his partner and lover girlfriend Martine. He soon wakes up in the hospital after having a face transplant. But not just any face transplant it is the face of a police officer that he killed. He is told now he has to work for the good guys to bring down the baddies and all those that he worked with and knew.

Now what the police and the good guys don't realize is they created a new persona that wants to seek revenge against the whole entire world, hates everybody and now he is a volcano of anger and violence thicker than he ever has been.

This is truly a memorable show with characters created through imaginative means and truly original make believe. It takes detectives and violence and comic glee to a whole new level as you watch the story unfold.

It's a thick dark comedy mixed with action in that classic black-and-white film Noir type of setting.
