8060048,5,B0009FCDY2,"Mr. Anderson takes a wild mustang and shows the steps that take the horse to its first ride and beyond. For the horseowner who has a regularly handled colt, the process would be far less involved. This video gives amazing detail and insight into training horses. I have used many of the techniques with great sucess and have seen first-hand their usefulness. My farrier commented that I'd done a good job since the first time he had seen my un-gentled horse. I had never trained a horse before, so this video was instrumental in my relationship with my new colt. Thank you Clinton Anderson!

Even if you're not going to train your horse yourself, this video series would be informative for a new horseowner to know what they should expect if they are having their horse trained by a professional. After watching this video you're equipped with knowing questions to ask the trainer you're considering hiring.",1178150400,9,907,4.814102564102564
