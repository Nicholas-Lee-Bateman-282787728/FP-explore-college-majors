8471371,3,B005G7WGUE,"When Kim (Kelsey Oluk) goes missing. Patrick (Dany Gehshan) and Kelly (Vanessa Broze) suspect there is something going on in Kenneyville, Ontario. We see the bad guy operation and know it involves experimental drugs and the white slave trade, but there is something else we must wait for.

The compound is run by Adrian (Michael Scratch) who played his role like he was in a bad Billy Zane film...which for me was a good thing. The film has your typical action scenes, some groping etc., but not overly exciting or horrific...made in Canada and we can tell.

I thought the alternate ending showed a little more imagination.  2 1/2 stars

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Clothed sex. No nudity. Vanessa Broze bra/panties",1408406400,3,711,4.9
