7948992,4,B00005OOQO,Not a bad DVD but most of the matches are just clips. Luckily some of the matches are included in their entirty as special features. If not it would have been a 2 or 3 star review,1378944000,,179,3.864864864864865
7948993,4,B00005OOQO,"I've known about this set for some time now but really never thought of purchasing it. I've recently been watching alot of ECW so I decided what the heck & purchased it.

The Good

The two triangle elimination matches seem to be complete as editing does not really effect them.

The three complete matches are pretty damn good even having a title change. I can't believe the Dudley VS RVD/Sabu match has yet to make it onto a WWECW set yet.

The Bad

After every big move, they replay it. It gets annoying after only the second time seeing it.

The commentary. It's not as bad as XPW but they should have had Joey Styles call the action. The bonus matches are in Japanese but the action was good that I didn't mind.

Overall, if you can find this set cheap enough then you should get it. The three complete matches are well worth it & the edited matches aren't so bad.",1368835200,,868,4.320987654320987
7948994,2,B00005OOQO,"This is basically a compilation of matches taken from a couple of ECW tours with the FMW promotion in Japan.  The DVD itself was poorly put together as some of the matches are not shown in its entirety and the commentary is just completely awful as the guys calling the actions don't know much about the ECW wrestlers or the moves as they're mostly there to tell jokes amongst everything else.  Plus there are only 5 chapters when there are 8 matches on the DVD.  Matches are Sandman vs. Terry Funk vs. Bubba Dudley, Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Mike Awesome & Hido, John Kronis & Ricky Fuji vs. Jado & Gedo, Sabu vs. WING Kanemura vs. One Man Gang, and Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Masato Tatanka.  Tajiri vs. Super Crazy, Dudley Boyz vs. Jado & Gedo, Funk & Dreamer & Sandman vs. Mike Awesome, Mr. Ganosuke, WING Kanemura are matches that are clipped and aren't complete.

DVD extras include two matches that don't have english commentary on them...ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Tommy Dreamer and Tag Champions Dudley Boyz vs. RVD & Sabu which results in a rare ""overseas"" title change.

Unless you're a hardcore fan of ECW, I wouldn't waste my time on this because even though the matches are average to good...the way this DVD is put together would piss anyone off.",1148688000,,1279,4.563318777292577
7948995,3,B00005OOQO,"FMW:  International Slaughterhouse DVD features 11 matches pitting the stars of ECW vs. the stars of FMW.  While the billing sounds impressive, the product itself leaves a little to be desired.  A majority of the matches are ""clipped"" with the action being about average to slightly above average.  Still wrestling fans who favor hardcore wrestling, ECW or Japanese style hardcore wrestling may still find this DVD worth at least a rental or a borrow.
Here are a rundown of the contents of this DVD:
Your Hosts are ""Straight Up"" John Watanabe and Dan ""The Mouth"" Lovranski
1. Paul Heyman promo extolling the virtues of the work ethic of ECW wrestlers, Japanese wrestlers and the Japanese fans.
2. Buh Buh Ray Dudley vs. Sandman vs. Terry Funk:  3-way Ladder match.  Decent spots and hard action, but nothing overly exciting.  3 stars.
3. Gedo and Jado vs. the Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D'von):  Not never really got underway as they brawled to a double DQ within minutes.  DUD.
4. Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and the Sandman vs. Mike Awesome, WING Kanemura and Mr. Ganosuke:  Awesome six-man action.  Tons of caning.  4 stars
5. Hido/Mike Awesome vs. Dudleyz vs. Dreamer/Funk:  3-way tag elimination match.  Wild match with all 6 men fighting at the same time.  Lots of action.  3 1/2 stars.
6. John Kronus/Ricky Fuji vs. Jado and Gedo:  Short match but tons of nice aerial/martial arts spots 3  stars.
7. Tajiri vs. Super Crazy:  Short, but decent cruiser action from two of the best.  I've seen better from them though. 3 stars.
8. WING Kanemura vs. One Man Gang vs. Sabu:  All-out hardcore 3-way war with tons of tables, chairs and high-flying mayhem. 4  stars.
9. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Masato Tanaka:  AWESOME match.  Hard-hitting, tons of psychology.  Awesome work.  Best match on the DVD.  5 stars
10. Post-match Interview with Tanaka in the locker room.
Bonus Match 1:  RVD/Sabu vs. Dudleyz:  Decent hardcore war.  4 stars
Bonus Match 2:  Dreamer vs. Shange Douglas w/Francine:  Ditto 4 stars
THE VERDICT:
Overall, the DVD and matches were fairly mediocre with no matches being really
BAD (except the Dudleyz vs. Jado/Gedo) but again only a few matches are really of noteworthiness (Bigelow/Tanaka and the 6-man tag match).  Overall, the best reason to buy the DVD is for the mere novelty of the International/promotional match-ups and not the matches themselves.  Still, nonetheless, the DVD (or at least the VHS) is worth a watch if you come across it.  It's entertaining enough for an afternoon rental.
Recommendation to Rent/Borrow",1011398400,4,2541,4.898823529411764
7948996,2,B00005OOQO,"All the matches except the main event of Masato Tanaka vs Bam Bam Bigelow were clipped. Most were clipped to the point that it was not even fun to watch. The only thing to save the DVD was the fact that the DVD extras were FULL VERSION matches, unlike ALL other FMW DVDs, even the other one released with this one, The Judgement. These Bonus matches were very cool too: Shane Douglas vs Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title, and The Dudley Boyz vs Sabu and RVD in a great ECW Tag Title Match.
Buy it for the Bonus Matches, and avoid all other FMW DVDs like I am, as they seem to be clipping everything except the main events of all their DVDs now.",1007251200,3,642,4.144
7948997,4,B00005OOQO,"All of the matches were clipped. They were extremely hardcore, especially the three way dance with Sabu, Yukihiro Kanemura, and the One Man Gang. Probably the sorriest matches were the 6-man tag matches. The announcing was good, except they keep on calling a tiger driver a powerbomb. My all time favorite match on this video is the match between Tajiri and Super Crazy. The funniest part(to me, at least) was when Super Crazy flipping off Tajiri and Tajiri did it right back with a mocking face. Overall, this video is worth what you paid for.",1006041600,,544,4.7368421052631575
