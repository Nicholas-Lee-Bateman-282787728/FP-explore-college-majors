2713825,4,B000LSBXHA,"After briefly reviewing a clip of this DVD, I expected a mild workout - nothing special.  Was I wrong!  By the end I was sweating like crazy.  If you really concentrate on the moves and do them properly you will get an amazing calorie burn.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the light weights in the sculpting segments.  I would have liked to use 5 lbs instead of 3, but the fast movements made that impossible.
Debbie's cuing is a little ""off"", but that's OK.  She is motivating and her tone is soothing.",1209168000,6,510,4.206185567010309
2713826,4,B000LSBXHA,"This is a pretty good workout. My biggest complaint is that after you finish a segment, you get to do the exact same segment all over again. I would love this DVD if she would have mixed the segments instead of making you go through the exact same one again. I thought the toning/sculpting segments were excellent. The full workout gets long at times because she doesn't mix it up enough with the segments. With that being said, you do get a decent workout and the toning segments are well worth it.",1206144000,4,499,4.434782608695652
2713827,3,B000LSBXHA,"Instructor Debbie Rocker leads this walking working which adds light weights for some additional toning benefits.  She is joined by 2 background exercisers, one of whom shows lower impact modifications, in a beautiful mountain setting. There are two workouts on this DVD:  the main workout (labelled as 60 minutes but actually significantly longer at 68 minutes) and a 30-minute, shortened version of this.  Also included is a 57-minute CD designed for walking outdoors.

Debbie begins the main workout with a just under 6-minute warm-up that is mostly marching, although she adds some breathing work and arm movements.  This flows into a 4.5-minute basic cardio segment that is more of an extended aerobic warm-up.  The following 10-minute cardio segment starts to bring up the intensity a little, adding moves such as cross-country arms.  Another 7.5-minute cardio segment follows, this time adding a little impact with shuffles (a light side-to-side jog) as well as some upper body movements.  Then Debbie picks up light weights (1-5 lbs.) to lead you into the first toning segment.  Here she continues to do a lot of marching, but the aerobic pace slows as you move into basic strength moves such as squats, deadlifts, lat rows, and bicep curls.

Another 10-minute cardio segment follows.  This time, there is a little less marching and a bit more varied moves such as breast stroke arms and hamstring curls.  The final 7-minute cardio segment was probably the most intense, as Debbie includes more high-impact moves such as jumping jacks plus adds a bit of fun with some front punches.  Then there is a final 8-minute weights segment with additional marches, lunges, and triceps work.  The workout includes with a 3.5-minute cool-down/stretch.  The shorter, 30-minute workout (actually 33.5 minutes) uses the warm-up, the first cardio segment, the first weighted segment, the final cardio segment, and the cool-down.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this workout, mainly because I found it hard to keep my heart rate up.  For the most part, the cardio segments are not very intense, and my heart rate dropped even further during the toning segments.  I also found Debbie's cueing to be really lacking here:  not only does she fail to mirror-cue, but also she often cues a new move way ahead of time but fails to cue actually ON the new move.  Finally, I didn't find the included CD very motivating, however--it is simply Debbie talking, occasionally encouraging you to pick up the pace as the tempo changes, but that's it. Debbie talks throughout the DVD workout as well, which some may find annoying.  If you have liked Debbie's past workouts and/or enjoy combining low-intensity cardio with very light weight work, you might like this workout, but otherwise, I think there are better options available.",1204156800,20,2814,5.073913043478261
2713828,4,B000LSBXHA,"This is my first time trying anything by Debbie Rocker, and i truly loved it! I felt like it was a perfect workout for me--challenging but not so challenging that i will dread doing it next time. Afterwards, i felt so great, it was maybe the best ""natural high"" i've ever gotten from exercising. I am excited to do it again, and i know i will see results. I did find that her lack of mirroring was distracting, but i didn't let it bother me. If i were a total beginner, that might really throw me off, though. Other than that, i would have given it 5 stars. But it's definitely one of my VERY favorite workouts now, as far as the actual workout goes. The flow of her pace is really nice and effective.",1188000000,5,701,4.2
2713829,5,B000LSBXHA,Ms Rocker scores another winner.  This video is well paced with a choice of either a 30 min or a ca. 60 min workout.  The moves are well explained and the workout brought some well-earned sweat to my brow.,1178928000,9,205,4.230769230769231
2713830,5,B000LSBXHA,"I really enjoyed this workout!  It is perfect for early morning exercise.  No jarring, out-of-control hyperactive moves here.  The moves are simple, safe, and effective, with just enough impact to help keep the bones strong.  You get out of this workout what you put into it.  And it's more than just marching around.  Sure, there's lots of marching (it is a ""walking"" workout after all ;)), but there are plenty of other moves--boxer's shuffles, side-to-sides, hamstring kickbacks, jumping jacks--not to mention the toning portions.  Debbie encourages you to focus on each and every move, not just fling your arms and legs around mindlessly.  This is where the effectiveness comes in.  I wasn't bored at all, and the Arizona scenery was beautiful.  The strength moves are controlled and effective and work the whole body.  Debbie's reminders to constantly engage the core as the ""base"" from which all other movement originates keeps the stomach muscles engaged throughout the whole workout.  I've been looking for a routine just like this to adequately work me out without wiping me out, leaving me overly tired and hungry for the rest of the day.  Unless you're used to high-intensity workouts all the time, I feel that this routine will be well worth your time.  The key is to focus on the moves and get the most out of them.  I'll be purchasing other Debbie Rocker DVDs to go with this one!",1176249600,30,1394,4.872340425531915
2713831,3,B000LSBXHA,"I was hoping that the workout would be more integrative.  The description suggests that the walking would use the weights simutaneously; it doesn't.

The workout starts out with a walking warm-up; which is fine and necessary, but then just continues on with this monotonous walking in place.  Much later in the workout, the weights are introduced, but not in rhythm with the walking; the walking comes to a stand still.  Which, again, is fine.  Just not for me.  Someday, hopefully, someone will make a workout that is in constant motion with light weights - true toning and heart raising at the same time.",1175299200,26,606,4.834951456310679
2713832,4,B000LSBXHA,"This is a decent work out for someone like me that is older & has back issues but still wants to stay in shape. You definitely sweat & get a good work out in. I have several complaints but they are of the nit picky sort. First, if I am using an exercise dvd it is because I expect to be coached so please knock off all of the self advertising. It was hard enough to listen to the first time through if you use the video on a regular basis it gets really tiring. Next most videos do like you would do in a class room setting & the instructor moves opposite of what they say, they say right but go left because they are facing their audience, she doesn't do that so I have to go opposite of what she says so I don't get sea sick when they are moving the opposite way from me on the screen. Next she has lousy cueing, she describes what will be coming up next & then says come on let's go or something like that but she isn't telling you to do the next move but just encouraging you to keep moving. After doing the video several times I'm learning which times she is just trying to keep you moving & which times she is cueing you to go onto the next move but I don't think this is something we should have to learn. I will keep this video in my rotation because it is a good work out but I don't think I'll buy another one of her videos.",1397779200,3,1334,3.92619926199262
2713833,3,B000LSBXHA,"I have another workout by Debbie Rocker and had watched a clip from this one so I must admit, I knew what I was getting into.  Her cueing is not the best, she tends to ramble on and on and her form is not the best. One of the background exercisers was Stephanie Vitorino, an instructor herself, and she did a good job so I watched her instead.  This is a walking workout, however, and as such it does a decent job.  It should be noted, it is mostly a marching workout with a small amount of strength mixed in.  The strength portion was a bit weak, usually when doing strength with walking I'll use a lighter weight so that is what I did but she actually stops most of the time instead of walking so heavier weights would have been a better bet.  The workout is filmed in the dessert with all three women walking (marching) on some sort of rocky surface.  I found this distracting, I kept expecting one of them to step on a rock and hurt themselves.  When it was time to transition from one segment to the next, i.e. slower to faster, walking to strength, etc., the camera would pan to the background mountains then back to the walkers.  This made it difficult to know if you were supposed to continue what you were doing or change to something else. There is the full length 60 min. work out and a 30 min. mini workout as well.  I'm assuming the 30 min. one is just the 60 mins squashed down but I have not done it yet.  If I do, I plan on using heavier weights.
All in all, this is not my favorite walking workout but it did get the heart rate up a bit and will stay in my rotation, thankfully I have over 200 workout DVDs so it won't pop up any time soon.",1394928000,,1657,4.118012422360248
2713834,5,B000LSBXHA,"I really like Debbie Rocker.  I am experiencing a back injury and have needed to fnd a ""easier"" workout that would still be challenging.  I find that this dvd fits the bill.",1382313600,,173,4.375
2713835,1,B000LSBXHA,Totally boring and didn't even work up a sweat.  I did the 30 minute workout and it was basically 30 minutes of marching in place. Very disappointed.  Will stick with Leslie Sansone.,1367712000,3,182,4.65625
2713836,5,B000LSBXHA,"This one is fantastic!  Everything about it.  I enjoy the quietness of Debbie speaking so it does not overwhelm the workout while doing it.
She is not hectic in her speaking so you really tune in to what she wants you to do.",1360972800,2,224,4.186046511627907
2713837,3,B000LSBXHA,"An overall good workout but super boring.  The Leslie Sansone videos are much better, providing not only a good workout, but a feeling that you're actually in a class working for a common goal: to get in shape.  Not so with this video.  I just didn't feel engaged.  There was no mile markers, either, so you had no idea how many miles you walked by the end of it.  For me, this is very important.  I want to be able to say  that I've walked two miles or whatever.  The lack of the information makes me feel like I'm in one of those old fitness classes from the 80s where you jump around for an hour or so, but fail to have a sense of accomplishment and end up never doing it again.

I gave this video three stars because of the toning section.  She uses light weights.  Unlike the Leslie Sansone video's most of the training is done without walking.  I like this because it allowed me to concentrate on form, not miles.

Here's my short comparison of the Leslie Sansone videos vs Debbie Rocker.  Leslie makes you feel like you're walking.  Debbie makes you feel like you've been marching in place.",1358035200,,1097,4.334975369458128
2713838,5,B000LSBXHA,"I love this workout!!!! It makes you sweat and there is muscle conditioning to. The only complaint is that the way the beat of the music is going-they are not marching along with it, it's a bit off and it is annoying. I usually have to just listen to the music and march on my own just listening to instructions and glancing at the tv from time to time",1350086400,,352,4.115942028985507

2713840,5,B000LSBXHA,This is an excellent and challenging walking video. It is one of my favorite dvds.,1284336000,,82,4.533333333333333
2713841,1,B000LSBXHA,"I was actually BORED doing this workout.  And I love Leslie Sansone's workouts.  I mean, I kept asking ""when is this going to be over?"".  It was just THAT boring to me.  I've kept it around because I keep thinking maybe it'll grow on me, but so far, it hasn't.  I dread it every time I attempt it.  The music, the moves, even the instructor all bore me to death.  For my money, I'll stick with Leslie Sansone.",1215475200,4,409,4.166666666666667
