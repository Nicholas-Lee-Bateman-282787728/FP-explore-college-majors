8528360,4,B008I34XZ4,"4 stars as a musical , 3 stars for the drama.
Beautiful black and white exposition , production numbers creative and quite astonishing for the period . Ann Miller steals the proverbial show w dancing and personality , the three Stooges , wilder than ever , in a rare and very funny feature appearance. Their best ""maharaja "" routine , and several other zany bits .
So we have Miller , Lane, and Merrill as pawns in a never ending but basically affable game of who wins the spotlight in the big show - interestingly enough , a kind of audition for a new entertainment medium , television .
Gets a little confusing and dragged out , but all players get to kick up their heels, notably Allen Jenkins , a great eccentric hoofer . Another fun bit involves comic actress Elvia Allman , playing a ""spinster -ish"" secretary , cutting loose on the dance floor.

8528364,3,B008I34XZ4,"An uneven musical-comedy jamboree, ""Time Out for Rhythm"" (1941) works best as a showcase for Ann Miller and the Three Stooges. Surprisingly good production values from the Columbia ""B-movie"" assembly line. Stooge aficionados will rejoice over Moe, Larry and Curly's definitive version of their classic ""Maharaja"" routine.",1410220800,,321,5.851063829787234
8528365,5,B008I34XZ4,This is a classic. The music is simply incredible. Its is a travel to the good old days of television.,1376006400,2,102,4.15
8528366,4,B008I34XZ4,"While I'm not a Three Stooges fan, I purchased this 1941 B-musical to see the great Ann Miller, who has three terrific tap routines, including a breathtaking solo at the end.  There is also a lot of great music in the film, by Glen Gray And His Casa Loma Orchestra and Eduardo Durant's Rhumba Orchestra, some fine comedy bits by The Stooges, and singing by Rudy Vallee, Joan Merrill, Rosemary Lane, and the vocal group Six Hits And A Miss.

Amazingly, Ann Miller was only 18 when she made this movie.  She was a sensational tapper even then.  In a contest between Annie and Eleanor Powell, I'll still give Ellie the edge, but Annie comes pretty darn close.  It's like choosing between Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa on drums, or Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman on clarinet.  Take your pick.

Hopefully Columbia Choice or Warner Archives will issue some of Annie's RKO and/or Columbia B-pictures on DVD.  Some of them, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carolina-Blues/dp/B006DHAT8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carolina Blues</a>, are already out.",1361664000,5,1085,5.378698224852071
8528367,5,B008I34XZ4,Fabulous flashy 1940's musical starring Ann Miller ! Great fun and with the Three Stooges too. If you enjoy films from the golden age of Hollywood you will love this ! Just a great film to escape with.,1356912000,3,201,4.315789473684211
8528368,5,B008I34XZ4,"OH...the Three Stooges, of course :) :) :)
Yes, this film is indeed one of those rare ""out of their shorts"" appearences by the Three Stooges in a Columbia Pictures feature (about 1941). A true rarity for fans & movie buffs alike. The publisher is Sony on MOD media. Here with Amazon you will find a hard time even equaling the ""free"" shipping deal elsewhere.  So, be a smart Stooge & pair it up for the shipping deal...WOO...WOO...WOO
I'll get mine with the 2012 Dark Shadows spook-a-rama ..HA..HA..HA
Have fun !!!
