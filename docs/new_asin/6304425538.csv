8324538,3,6304425538,"This sixty minute video tape history of Richard the Lion Heart was a BBC series about 40 some years ago. It was part of a long series of programs about great personalities.  It was clear it was done on a small budget, and they did not have all the 'tricks' of todays computers at imaging, changing scenes smoothly. But for the price, just a few dollars one gets most of the history of that period in the late 1100's in England and Europe.  If one is interested in Richard the English king, it is a worthwhile video.",1256256000,,515,4.298969072164948
8324539,2,6304425538,"This video which tries to showcase the life of Richard Lionheart is inaccurate and very badly produced. It seems that the director have spend very little time reading about King Richard I, and the books that he read must have been very thin. Avoid this, there must be better sources out there. If you are interested in the life og Richard I, then read any book on the subject written by John Gillingham.",983750400,3,403,4.534246575342466
