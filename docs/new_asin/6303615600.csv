If you love musicals you will also love this show. It is a masterpeice of wit, music and a socioeconomic statement of 50's London. Highly amusing, highly entertaining and foot-tappingly atmospheric. It needs much more exposure and PBS show have bought it and aired it long ago. They were probably put off by the amount of sex and swearing, prudes beware!",972604800,14,488,4.686046511627907
693127,5,6303615600,"In one word: Brilliant! I've seen this video over and over again and still can't get enough of it. The film portays the life of two clerks in the Military Intelligence Battle Order department (MI bracket BO bracket) of  the War Office in the year 1956 and spans a period of about 3 weeks. It has  a sort of Dickensian flavour about it (contrast between the powers that be  and the relatively poor life of the two clerks in Walham Green, Fullham).  One of the clerks is mad about rock music, the other one about russian  literature and they both fall in love with a girl that doesn't not share  their interests. In between MI(BO) is facing disaster as the Egyptians are  moving toward nationalising the Suez Canal. At the department there's also  an American Officer who doesn't always share the views of the English,  which potrays the contrast between the Americans and the English in the  crumbling days of the British Empire.
By the way, the first reviewer  stated that this was Potter's last work. It is not. When Potter was  diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas (I think this would have been 1995),  he worked like a madman to get his last work finished, which are actually  two (linked) works.
1. Karaoke 2. Cold Lazarus
Both are made into  television series. Karaoke is sort of an autobiography (it deals with a man  (played by Albert Finney) who's dying of cancer). After his death his body  is frozen in. Cold Lazarus is set in the future where scientists are trying  to extract memories from the frozen man's brain. It's too surrealistic to  behold!",945820800,22,1560,4.627737226277373
693229,5,6303615600,"Dennis Potter was an English playwright who became best known in the US for The Singing Detective and Pennies From Heaven. His plays were witty, sarcastic, cynical and satirical in how they skewered the mainstream of society. Lipstick on Your Collar deals with a young soldier (Ewan McGreggor) who is assigned to the war office at Whitehall for his short spell of duty before he's to be discharged. There he witnesses the sloth, bigotry, indifference and addled thinking of his superiors who include both a soldier slightly higher in rank than he and three older men. While he does this he daydreams about his true devotion, to become a rock and roll singer like Eddie Cochran or Elvis. His daydreams are delightful lip synched episodes of pure British lunacy as he and his superiors bump and grind to his fantasies. Into the office comes a young fresh faced Welshman who is in love with French and Russian writers of the nineteenth century. A soap opera like drama ensues involving a young woman attached to one of the other men in the office and a vivid depiction of the dismal rigidity of the class structure in Britain in the late nineteen fifties is spelled out with both bitter irony and hilarious romance.",1360800000,,1212,4.748815165876778

693231,4,6303615600,"This British TV series is nearly impossible to get hold of here in the US, in spite of starring Ewan McGregor, who is now a pretty big star.  The story is hilarious, and the 50s music is a lot of fun.  Only down side is that the actors don't sing the music, but lip sync to the original recordings.  Still, well worth getting.  It does require a multi-region DVD player to play the PAL format.",1312934400,2,393,4.2
693232,5,6303615600,"Dennis Potter created many of the very best programs ever seen on TV. We here in the US have always loved the BBC offerings on our PBS stations. It's hard to count the number of programs that occupy the top ranks of ""best ever"", but I'll bet nearly all of them crossed the pond courtesy of BBC.

Lipstick on Your Collar is another brilliant Dennis Potter satire, this time about the end of the British Empire. It ended, by the way, with a resounding 'thud"" when Egypt kicked the Brits out of their country and took control of the Suez Canal.

As usual, Potter takes a story and peppers it with oddly appropriate lip-synched songs. A very young Ewan McGregor is brilliant as a young ""cog"" in the British bureaucracy. He shows clear signs of the brilliant actor we all now know him to be. Potter shows the staid British Aristocracy that can't or won't believe the Empire they have been pretending still exists is finally finished. Potter basically tells them to wake up to the truth and accept the world as it really is. His approach takes a potentially boring history lesson and turns it into a drama that leaves us hanging on every word, eager to see how Potter describes the next boneheaded move the British government takes.

I think ""Pennies from Heaven"" and ""The Singing Detective"" are the two best programs ever to be seen on TV and ""Lipstick on Your Collar"" is the third. How often do we have the opportunity to be challenged by such writing and production? Bring your brains with you, you'll need them. It's hard to describe my reaction to ""Lipstick"", my brain has seldom been blessed with such brilliance.

When will we see this wonderful series on DVD in a USA format? Precious few of us can afford the huge price for a rare copy of the VHS set. Head to your rare video store or library and rent this brilliant program. Your brain will be forever in your debt. Oh, and just go ahead and buy ""Pennies from Heaven"" and ""The Singing Detective"". your DVD collection will immediately become an order of magnitude better and you'll want to see them again and again.",1234828800,3,2068,4.536193029490617

693235,4,6303615600,"This movie is so much fun, The characters are so different, I think its supposed to be a comedy/musical. Ewan is so cute in it, there are some boring dry moments in it but all in all I thought it was good, very clever and did I mention Ewan looked so cute! those smoldering eyes!",1037491200,2,279,4.090909090909091
693236,4,6303615600,"If you are an Ewan McGregor fan, you'll find this video an unexpected delight.  Yes, he's very young, and his character isn't nearly developed enough, but his future success in acting is right there for anyone to see--in his bright, wistful eyes, the twist of an Elvis-inspired hip, the twitch of a mischievous smile.  When he breaks into song--even though he's lip-snycing--you can't help but be charmed.
The video doesn't quite live up to the promise of its opening episode.  The storyline involving the second young male lead is hurt by the actor playing Pvt. Francis Francis, who is so over the top in his words and actions that you actually start to think he deserves to be miserable. Some scenes run a little too long,and the whole thing would probably have worked better if it had been 4 epidsodes instead of 6.  But the music is toe-tapping good fun to hear, and you can't help but smile to see grown men, some of them very up in years, singing and dancing around an office in three piece suits. Some of these fellows deserve awards for just being willing to do some of the things they're asked to do.
Definitely worth a look!",996969600,9,1134,4.571428571428571
693237,5,6303615600,"The late Dennis Potter knew how to write music and satire transforming it to brilliant comedy productions that Baz Luhrmann can't match. Lipstick on Your Collar is a dazzling example of Potter's brilliance. It features baby face, 20-year old Ewan McGregor (Pvt. Mick Hopper) and bumbling Giles Thomas (Pt. Francis Francis) as two low level clerks in the Army's War Office. Poking jest at classism, rank and intelligence in the military, and age versus wisdom, the young men are seperated from their elder officers by more than just education and experience. A generation gap that would later erupt in Britian with the Beatles, glam rock, and punk is exposed at its sexual roots. Lipstick holds little reverence for conventional society. Hopper's rock 'n roll fantasies move the staid officers to the beat of ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" with homoerotic gyrations that laughably strip any iota of dignity from British military precision. The boys moon over girls they can't have, worry over the pending invasion of Egypt by old Brits who still believed in Empire, and are the brunt of a conservative mindset that was post-WWII society. Staging and costumes melt 50s settings into 90s PoMo pastiche to combine the Brit love of staged extravaganza with Hollywood Rebel Without a Cause acne. This set of three videos is required for any lover of the late Potter's work.  Fans of Ewan McGregor will see the first glimmer of talent that would later mature in stellar films like Moulin Rouge, Nora, and Trainspotting.  A Keeper!",991958400,26,1518,5.01984126984127

7851821,5,6303615600,What can I say? Lipstick on Your Collar is my favorite movie. I never tire of it. It is not only beautifully acted but deeply subtle.

7851828,5,6303615600,"Dennis Potter, an English playwright was famous for The Singing Detective and Pennies from Heaven. Lipstick on Your Collar is a sharp satire on the changing English social world in the late fifties. Set in a London Whitehall war office a young soldier (Ewan McGregger) about to be discharged at the end of his service and has been sent to the office to help out for the last few weeks of his service due to his skills and knowledge. His superiors are a sadistic young officer and three older bureaucratic functionaries. The Suez Crises is ongoing with it symbolizing the further erosion of the British Empire that is no longer part of the identity of the young solider. He daydreams of being an American rock and roll singer and his dreams come to life in scenes with the entire office lip synching to American pop music of the era.

Another young Welsh soldier is likewise assigned to the office due to his knowledge of French and Russian. His passion is for Proust and Tolstoy. He lives with his aunt and uncle in the same building as the sadistic young officer and his girlfriend for whom he soon engages in romantic fantasies.

The interactions of these characters in and out of the war office lead to dramatic, funny, tragic and ironic consequences interspersed with more rock and roll lip synched scenes relevant to the scene.

I watched this through twice and enjoyed it just as much both times (with a few years in between).",1362355200,,1432,4.6521739130434785
