8167002,5,B00005O07D,Great Jazz movie!!!!! Because I star in it! Check it out!,1435190400,,57,4.2727272727272725
8167003,4,B00005O07D,I hear the 1-star reviewer saids he hated it but I'ma give it 3.5 stars (C+ or C-) then just incase it was good. I kinda shocked when Shoop (Antonio Fargas) played a more Miles Davis role on the set. There's no reason of failure or dissapointment. This is a must-have if u like the sound of 'Mo Better Blues and Bird which I suggest.,1105488000,,333,4.138461538461539
8167004,1,B00005O07D,"The movie is extremely boring and the blind guy is just plain annoying, Antonio Fargas (Shoop) doesn't make the movie any better. I recomend that you see the movie only to lagh at how poorly it was displayed.",1063670400,,208,4.5
