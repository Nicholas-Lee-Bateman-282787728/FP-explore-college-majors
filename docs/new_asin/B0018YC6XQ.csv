8271441,2,B0018YC6XQ,"Chilean martial artist/actor Marko Zaror's third film is a sloppy, poorly made mess. Marko Zaror is an adequate actor. Marko Zaror is an AMAZING stuntman. Unfortunately, the wrong Marko Zaror is in this movie. The story is a heavily-cliched drug-dealer/police officer crime thriller whose sole point of interest is the wail of lament for justice that righteous, powerless Mexican citizens utter constantly under their breath up to this very day. When Zaror's character, a recent police academy graduate, discovers the corruption permeating every aspect and level of the judicial system, he tries to fight against that corruption, with all the conflict these stories usually entail: a superior who is actually in league with the bad guy, a partner who tries to convince Zaror that bribes are just a part of law enforcement, a love interest who tries to convince him to do the right thing but who ends up being kidnapped... Many of the plot points are easy to see a mile away and do not surprise. The camerawork is criminally bad during the (FAR too scarce) fight scenes, causing the two combatants to be only partially in frame and the action to be unintelligible. Zaror's stunt skills are NOT utilized in this film, leaving this viewer feeling short-shrifted. Compare it to watching Jackie Chan or Tony Jaa in an action movie with only one 3-minute fight scene; What's the point? While Zaror's acting is passable, some of the other actors are laughably bad. Stiffness and unbelievability are the most common techniques employed. The most annoying facet of this film, however, is the filmmakers' amateurishly awful decision to show certain scenes in a sort of dream-like flashback, and THEN going back and replaying the scene straight through. It's such a bad decision, I would even decry it if it had been a student film. In summation, there is no reason for even Zaror super-fans to watch 'Entre Llamas' (coincidentally, there is not a SINGLE llama in this movie...)",1267488000,,1967,5.0
