2816656,2,B000PDZYRG,"never judge a book by its cover. I saw the cover and with all the high rating I figured cover looks fun, might have routines where your joints will be flexed, exercise will be applied repetition and strength will be obtain . Ohh was I wrong. It just scott sonnon in an empty room solo telling you and showing you some totally boring exercises . what a waste of money  . Maybe if your an elderly , or middle age individual I'm sure it might work for you  , but even then you should challenge yourself. The saying ""there's something for everyone "" surely didn't apply to me . There was nothing for me with this dvd.",1301616000,4,613,4.230769230769231
2816657,4,B000PDZYRG,"I enjoyed this DVD, I learned many new exercises for increasing range of motion. I like Scott's method of working every joint in the body.  He integrates yoga, tai chi and martial arts to develop his own method.  The intro is long, but the actual workouts are great. The DVD is long and I often do it in segments, it is a great value for the price.",1266710400,17,348,4.17910447761194
2816658,5,B000PDZYRG,"Ageless mobility is a very good workout to give juice to all the joints of the body and you don't have to be flexible to do this.
 You work from your neck to your toes with this and you will feel great, afterwards.
 I also have Coach Sonnon's Intu-Flow and that is great, also.  You can see some video on youtube.",1258329600,13,313,4.098360655737705
2816659,5,B000PDZYRG,"The format of this DVD is unassuming and very easy to follow, but it's also challenging. Along the way, Scott recognizes that some people will be able to take the moves further than others, but he advises you to stop when the pain level is at 3 because some pain is necessary and causes the muscles and joints to flood with much needed moisture. (The pain-Free part comes after the muscles and joints are in good working order.) After 2 workouts (a few days apart) I already felt strength and fluidity in my movements that wasn't there before.  This is what I was looking for.  I'm 61, in good shape, but have some stiffness that I'm determined to deal with; I don't believe that getting older means we should just sit down in a recliner and give up.

From the cover, I expected to be viewing a class of several people, but it's just Scott in a big empty room, which isn't a problem; I like his quiet, assured manner. As I progress, I expect to use this DVD several days a week, but for now, I need a few days in between to let the soreness work out. I don't vegetate during those days; I'm using other workout DVDs and Wii Fit.

Yes, I would recommend this DVD for anyone looking to stay or get in shape. I've learned some things about how my muscles work together, about where my stiffness originates, and about pushing myself, just enough, feel better later.",1255392000,40,1361,4.388888888888889
2816660,5,B000PDZYRG,"I have issues with my low back and hip and purchased this dvd to help improve my mobility and address my imbalances.  This dvd consists of about 45 minutes of fluid, mobility exercises which are done standing.  Then you move to the floor for another 45 minutes (approx.) of yoga-type stretches.  None of the  moves are particularly difficult, but Coach Sonnon explains modifications so that you can vary the intensity. His instruction is very clear and his manner is super encouraging and motivating.

I have many yoga dvd's and usually start getting antsy after an hour. But this nearly 90 minute program flew right by. The first time I completed the program I felt an immediate improvement and release of some of the built up tension in my muscles.  A few hours later I felt even better!  I've had this dvd for about a month and have completed the program once or twice a week.  I plan to continue using it at least once a week.",1238112000,32,930,4.5602409638554215
2816661,5,B000PDZYRG,"Sonnon again takes ancient exercises and puts them in a modern, scientific light. He strips the mystism and gives you a fantastic mobility program based on 1,000's of years of experience. The best follow up to Intu Flow.",1220054400,8,220,4.815789473684211
2816662,5,B000PDZYRG,"One run through the well-described exercises on this 98-minute DVD, and I knew this simple program would work. Sonnon walks the viewer through each movement or pose, joint by joint from head to toe, carefully describing and demonstrating each action.

While it's easy to see how athletic and capable he is at the exercises, he's still able to make the viewer comfortable with his or her ability. I was surprised and pleased to complete the workout with his suggested modifications from the first session.

Ageless Mobility a great value at this price. Bravo!",1197072000,23,558,4.989247311827957
2816663,5,B000PDZYRG,"Obviously Scott Sonnon knew you could.  I am a big fan of his approach to wellness and own most of his DVDs.  Ageless mobility is a long workout,one hour plus, but well worth it.  It is a great addition to his more dynamic workouts. It adds terrific, gentle techniques for improved joint mobility and better efficiency in athletic activities. It's also great for recovering from a long commute, or a session in front of the computer.",1185062400,19,433,4.671052631578948
8190743,3,B000PDZYRG,God bless Scott!  If he could only stop trying to sound so smart and airey fairy he would have sold a lot more stuff! At least its not as bad as some of his early stuff where even a semi educated semi intellectual person like me was left clueless by wtf are you actually trying to say.,1488844800,,285,4.0
8190744,3,B000PDZYRG,"Nice instruction and well done but way more than i was looking for. I can't do all that. I love Scott Sonnon's basic ""Intuflo"" exercises. They have helped me tremendously with joint pain. So I tried this thinking it would be a step further but was way more than I can do.",1429920000,3,271,4.230769230769231
8190745,1,B000PDZYRG,"Scott Sonnon is a fraud in ""advocating"" for Dyslexia. I am very disappointed and would not recommend his book to anyone. Actions speak louder than words and he is all talk.",1415750400,4,172,4.580645161290323
8190746,5,B000PDZYRG,Great DVD. Very effective with low impact.,1411776000,,42,5.142857142857143
8190747,5,B000PDZYRG,"Great for everyone, especially aging folks or differently abled folks or those who are very de-conditioned and need to start slowly without pressure.",1408060800,,149,5.521739130434782
8190748,5,B000PDZYRG,"Scott does an excellent job of describing and filming this DVD. I'm easily able to incorporate his exercises into some of the classes in the gym I own. As an older athlete, mobility is more important than how much weight I can put up. This has improved the weight I can put up because of mobility lost when one doesn't cross train. Thanks Scott...",1381622400,5,347,4.4375
8190749,1,B000PDZYRG,"As a fitness professional and kettlebell instructor I really liked Scott's material intially, but as I did more and more research into his credentials I found the majority of his accomplishments are greatly exaggerated. It's very hard to trust someone with educating me on something as important as my health when he can't even be honest about his background.",1364601600,8,359,5.101694915254237
8190750,5,B000PDZYRG,"I had been looking at Scott Sonnon on you tube for a while, then decided to buy the agelessmobility program. The sender despatched the dvd very promptly and it arrived in excellent condition. Thanks very much I am now using the program and feeling the benefits immediately. It's quite a hefty program nearly two hours of yoga type stretching, but you are guided through every movement. It's great to be able to practice it in the privacy of my own home.",1361404800,3,453,4.604938271604938
8190751,5,B000PDZYRG,"Scott Sonnon is a great teacher. He's a martial arts champion and one of the most devoted teachers I've seen in a long time. His workout DVDs seem to come in different levels of intensity. This is about the gentlest workout in his repertoire. Anyone can do it. Some of the moves remind me of Bikram yoga without the heat. I'm in my forties. I have joint pain and stiffness. My shoulders and neck tighten up easily, especially when I practice Jiu-Jitsu. So this DVD is really helpful. He focuses on breathing and movement that restores and maintains joint mobility. If you read more about Scott Sonnon, you will see he has a whole philosophy about training. He isn't in favor of physique-focused workouts like body building. It's all about movement and flow. This is a long workout. Sometimes I only do part of it. Very happy with this DVD.",1355184000,6,839,4.6
8190752,5,B000PDZYRG,"This DVD is excellent.  I bought it because I am currently suffering from a bulging lumbar disc.  Its clearly marketed at middle-aged and older people (I am 37) but it will be beneficial to you if you suffer from an injury such as mine or general muscle tightness aches and pains.  Of all of the DVDs of his I have seen I think this one is easiest to follow (although it is long, about 120 minutes).  I think it is also a great introduction to the rest of his work.

As a result of following this program twice a week I immediately noticed improvements in my mobitility and a reduction in back pain.  My physio has been impressed with the acceleration in my recovery from injury and I hope to soon be back to martial arts (Muay Thai).",1307491200,10,734,4.282608695652174
