6567934,1,B00MC4ALZG,"This review is only relating to the Episode content NOT quality of DVDs or Bonus features. Just the episodes.

And You Killed Brian because? You guys are serious..Insert my First Name..  really.. so you Kill off Brian to bring on VINNIE the stereotypical Italian Dog? And then Vinnie disappears and Brian comes back. Except this is not a wiser Brian or a more loving Family Guy. The whole season was trash. Seth you were of making TED and other shxt didn't give a  damn..about this seasons quality/ The  few (I think TWO) songs in thw whole season were atrocious and meangless ..Why should anyone buy this season? It is also fairly traumitzing to any child to see the family beloved pet character killed for no reason other than a CHEAP ratings ploy. You guys really do SUCK. And you are ..inseet my first name.

6567958,5,B00MC4ALZG,"I am a diehard Family Guy fan who never stops tuning in...even when the sacred boundaries of animation are tested. I have always believed you should NEVER kill off one of the main characters, only, and I mean, only, an occasional supporting character. In this 3-disc set, on disc one, yep, you guessed it....this is the season collection that includes ""Life of Brian"" that saddened fans everywhere...OK thankfully, he has been resurrected, and although I kinda liked the wise-cracking ""new dog"" Vinny, I didn't see how he could just replace Brian.. supplement the program maybe, but not totally replace Brian. As someone who till keeps up with the show I can see that Vinny was only a short-term replacement.

In the second way my sensibilities were offended was the episode ""A Fistful of Meg"" which is also included in this set. Meg's life is on the line when a big, hulking sociopath named Mental Mike transfers to James Woods High school and Meg is on the receiving end of Mike's wrath. I'm sorry, I know it's the 21st century but if you're a big tough male bully there is still a sacred code to adhere to in which you only get to pick on other boys that are weaker than you. I'm glad the neighborhood ladies' man Quagmire was able to step in at the eleventh hour and train Meg in self-defense.

I don't think Family Guy is any less funny than it was when it launched one the airwaves all the way back in 1999 (wow, where does the time go?) I notice that Stewie acts more effeminate now; whereareas in the early years he was very good in the role of diabolical genius. Peter is still as bumbling and self-absorbed as always (yet he does manage to come around to how other people are feeling and how hix actions affect others) Lois is a tad cattier than she used to (when the situation calls for it). Meg is still angst-ridden and Chris still just like his dad in ways. Other than that Family Guy has stood the test of time.

The deleted scenes are worthwhile too, if you just wanna kill time: Bonnie asking for a ""p. o. s."" (This DVD collection is uncensored, I would like to point out) and Stewie thinks a menstrual cycle is a ""good way to get around town"" LOL :)",1435104000,4,2167,4.439698492462312

6567963,4,B00MC4ALZG,"This marks the second time a full season of the show has been released in one set (volume 12 had the full season 11 on it).  In prior years Fox, in its infinite wisdom, would release sets that had half of one season and half of another on it.  It has really been a minor point because in terms of following the show, it is not like it ever has season long story arcs that need to be followed.  You just have to have seen a prior episode to get a reference if they call back to something.  But for those of us who do get the DVDs it has often meant paying the same price for a set with a partial season on it.  So it is nice that they have come around to doing what they should have in the first place.  It also makes for a pretty funny joke this season in one of the episodes.

As far as the show itself goes, it is pretty standard with what it has been doing the past few years.  It can get repetitive with some of the gags (they do like vomit), but I do think they are still entertaining on a consistent enough basis to keep fans of the show entertained.  This season has the controversial story line in the middle involving Brian (chances are everyone knows what it is and the cover of the DVD set basically gives it away) that definitely shook the show (and the fans) up.  It also sees the return of Cleveland after the Cleveland Show's cancellation.  Like the show always has, it makes fun of pretty much any topic, and because the DVD is uncensored it replaces some of the tamer jokes from the broadcast version with harder edged versions.  It is also worth noting that nothing gets bleeped out on the DVDs, so expect all the swearing to be in every episode.

For those who get the DVD set, as far as extras go, there are deleted scenes from every episode, a couple episodes showing the full animatics with the dialogue, and a short feature on the Brian storyline with show runners and Seth Green talking about the fan reaction.  Pretty standard for what has been included before.",1432425600,7,1986,4.23342175066313

I didn't want to copy it, just wanted to buy it and honestly watch it on my region free dvd player, but the dvd didn't let me, it said I can only use region 1 player.(never had this problem with any other US dvds) Therefore I had to tamper with my own player.",1427241600,,517,4.128712871287129

6568002,3,B00MC4ALZG,"Not so funny, a lot of hits and misses. The hits are episodes like ""Quagmire's Quagmire"", where he meets a female version of himself. The misses include the return of Cleveland. He's completely a third wheel and his inclusion slows the show down. Also the multi part death of Brian is disapointing and slow. A lot of the quick humour is still there but overall this season comes off as flat. There's a lot of Stewie, but the character really needs Brian to play off of. Worth owning for fans of the show, but sets like season 9 are much stronger. In fact I'd show season 9 to someone new to the series and let them find season 12 on their own.",1420848000,,643,4.278688524590164

While not as horrible as say Seahorse Seashell Party, Life of Brian is perhaps the most dirty, manipulative episode in the entire show. It literally forces you to cry for a character that lost any and all like ability years ago! Then, they trick you into thinking they've written Brian out permanently and replaced him with Vinnie, who, while a stereotype is infinitely more likable than that liberal atheist hack job. They barely go two episodes and they bring Brian back through a cutaway gag from Life of Brian. Word to the wise, if you're squeemish, don't watch Christmas Guy, you'll never wanna drink eggnog again.

6568020,4,B00MC4ALZG,"I don't understand how people can say that Family Guy is on its way out the door because if that were true the death of Brian Griffin would not have had the big reaction it did. It would have been no big deal what so ever. I don't personally care about the fact that they changed from volume to season on this one as it is season twelve after all and volumes eleven and twelve had seasons 10 and 11  on them. So I don't think it is a big deal. Plus the whole splitting seasons onto multiple volumes was really a dumb idea anyway so I am glad they are going back to having seasons on volumes like they did with volumes one and two which had seasons one, two and three on them and then after that they started separating the seasons so just be glad we got another full season instead of half of one and then have to wait on the second half. Also the reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is cause I bought this and had to return it because the first one I got the DVD was not burnt properly and skipped on the first episode and had censored episodes. The new one I have still has a burning issue but plays through fine and is uncensored but I give four the bad manufacturing process on the disc.",1418169600,9,1206,4.046025104602511
