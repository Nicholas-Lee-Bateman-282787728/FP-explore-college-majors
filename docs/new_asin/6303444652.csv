652727,4,6303444652,"If I'm not mistaken, this was a straight to video film.  Despite that, I thought it was actually pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia plays a no nonsense judge that can't get no satisfaction.  Billy Wirth plays the dark, handsome stranger that thrills and eventually chills her.  Surprisingly, the love scenes left a lot to the imagination.....(which isn't often the case today) and they were still hot despite the fact that the characters were still clothed!  Not a bad flick at all.",1172534400,4,476,4.9
652728,4,6303444652,"Quiet courtroom mystery featuring a strong Bedelia in the lead as a judge, who is in an unhappy marriage and strikes up an affair with a librarian (Billy Wirth). Her dear friend Charles (Dabney Coleman) is murdered, and she soon finds that the defending attorney is pointing evidence towards her. Well-made, little known feature with good performances and an exciting storyline.",1101427200,4,378,5.213114754098361
652729,5,6303444652,"If you are looking for a movie that has it all, this one is it. A thriller that has you guessing who did it. Also, the great twist with her having an affair because of how sex starved she is, Bonnie Bedilia is awesome! From an alley to having an orgasm in her chambers, this movie has everything. But it's not all sex, it's a murder mystery that will have you guessing!",972000000,13,369,4.138888888888889
7847664,5,6303444652,"When I first saw this film I was so enthralled by the leads. Bonnie Bedelia and Dabney Coleman were superb, let me tell you. The bad guy played by Wirth was also great. The location of the film was original too. Usually a film like this would be set in New York or Los Angeles. But the setting in Detroit was fresh and I enjoyed it tremendously.

Bonnie Bedelia plays a conservative judge who shows no mercy to criminal defendants. But what comes around goes around as she has made many enemies on both sides of the law and on either side of the bench. At home, her marriage is breaking up and this leads her to have an affair with a librarian who catches her eye and pursues her to the point where a steamy affair ensues. Unfortunately the murder of a colleague (Played Wonderfully By Dabney Coleman) leads to the prosecution of the wrong woman. When evidence from her home is found at the scene of the crime she realizes that someone is framing her. With the help of a friend of hers from the Detroit Police Department (Played Wonderfully By Henry Brown) she sets out to discover who it is who has framed her and how she can avert her arrest and conviction of her colleague.

I highly recommend this film. But like many of the others, I must ask why this film is not on DVD! It is worthy of being on DVD and should be released. I see so many worthless films (Like Jackass, For Instance) that have been released onto DVD while a film such as this can barely garner any kind of media production. it's not even available on VHS! WHY IS THAT! I'm the seventh person to give this film a Five Star rate and the fifteenth person overall to rate the film. If you can find it on any media I recommend you buy it!

The price was pretty expensive for a VHS and used at that so I may not keep the item and return it.",1422835200,,248,3.5925925925925926

7847668,5,6303444652,"This movie with Bonnie Bedelia is absolutely fabulous!!! I agree with all of the other viewers who say it is not only stylishly sexy, but a scary mystery- thriller, too!! I cannot understand why this is not on DVD, affordable for all of us. PLEASE - see what can be done to rectify this situation. Thank you so much, Teenchie.",1404345600,,326,4.45
7847669,5,6303444652,"I had this movie on VHS, and it is one that I certainly remember! I have been watching and waiting for it to be for sale on DVD, at a price people can afford. Why hasn't this wonderful movie been produced??? What, positively, could be the holdup? I would love to see it again, hopefully, before I pass, and I am just in my late 50's!",1403740800,,333,4.0606060606060606
7847670,2,6303444652,"I worked on this film in Detroit, MI and had a wonderful time while doing so.  I've worked on many films and Judicial Consent turned out to be one of the better ones, Bonnie Badelia was such a delight to work with.  The mood of the film is wonderful and the suspense thrilling.  The only reason I'm giving the film two (2) stars is not for the film itself but because after 15 years or so it still hasn't been released to the general public.  Has everyone forgotten about this film?  I keep looking for it, but still no release date,  Please release this film now!  I would love to see this wonderful movie again and also have the thrill of seeing my name in the end credits on yet another motion picture. (That never seems to get old!)",1387929600,5,736,4.251798561151079
7847671,5,6303444652,"I just don't get why this awesome movie wasn't manufactured on DVD and mass produced to the public? It's really a great movie and even though it never hit the theatre screen and was only shown on TV it should've been marketed on DVD for the public to see and purchase.
Sure there may be a lot of sex scenes in the movie but it has an incredible story that goes with it and an suspenseful one at that! I love this movie and have it on VHS but who watches VHS movies anymore now days? I have a vast DVD collection and would give anything to have this movie on DVD. Never mind Amazon has a few out there from Sellers who have it for $1,000 and more in Japan ONLY! Don't get that either. If this movie IS on DVD in Japan then why hasn't it hit the markets here in the U.S. since it's made by and stars American actors? I'm thinking surely the $1,000 copies are just that - copies or bootlegs. Just don't get it. If you can purchase it on DVD in Japan then WHY NOT HERE in AMERICA???? Hello??? Also there's some used ones available as well but for just a mere $100 or more too. Come on!!!! As if the average hard working minimum wage American can afford these prices? Too bad I'm not rich or won the lottery then I could get this movie on DVD from Japan. NOT!!! Sorry! Would rather give that much money to the starving people in other countries much less the U.S. before I'd purchase a $1,000 or $100 DVD! Our world is so messed up! Very greedy and sinful! Have mercy! Oh well... I still watch this movie from time to time when I'm glued to the TV some days and feel like watching my old VHS tapes but really don't enjoy a tape compared to a DVD that you can take anywhere and everywhere. I'll be darn if I would pay that much for a DVD! Sad anyone who has actually paid THAT much for this movie on DVD or any other. Give it to the poor and needy or your local church or an organization who could really use and need it.
PLEASE someone out in Hollywood or wherever, market this movie on DVD!! I would purchase it in a heart beat if only it were $10 or under. It truly is a great movie in my book but not worth $1,000 or even $100. No movie is worth THAT much on DVD, Blue Ray or whatever! Sorry but just had to get my two cents worth in here with the other comments because this movie is one of my favorites and two, just couldn't believe how much Seller's are asking for this on DVD especially from the land of the Rising Sun! UNREAL!!!",1376352000,5,2432,4.058212058212058
7847672,4,6303444652,"I can't help but be a bit partial because I was one of the first camera assistants on this project but the ""meat"" of the film contains some great portrayals from some very familiar faces and the camera work by director of photography James Glennon A.S.C. is really quite amazing. Bonnie Bedelia is sumptuous as always and Billy Wirth, Will Patton, Lisa Blount and Dabney Coleman really bring you in to their characters as well. I watched it some years after working on it and really forgot all the behind the scenes stuff while watching and just got pulled in to the story. That also says a lot about the expertise of the director and editor.
 It's a great ride no matter which side of the camera you are on!",1344643200,,708,4.446153846153846
