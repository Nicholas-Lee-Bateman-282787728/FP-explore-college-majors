312249,4,6301130391,"I was the Location Manager on this movie. Claude LeLouch is one of the great Directors of our time. You might remember he directed MAN AND WOMAN. Jimmie Caan was the star and I had worked with him before on El Dorado. The acting is great and I know you will love the locations in and around Tucson, Arizona. Also, in the Sonoita foothills of rolling green. One of the scenes that was cut I wish had stayed. It was the longest, uncut piece, I had ever seen. At Old Tucson, we had laid track across the street from the train depot to the Hotel. LeLouch is on the camera crane, holding the camera on his shoulder. Cann gets off the train, walks halfway across the street (camera crane rolls with him)he stops and chats with someone, then continues into the hotel, camera goes around the corner, looks through the window as Jimmie registers. As he starts up the stairs the crane rises up to the second floor window as we see him enter the room. Then, Claude steps off the crane and through the window as Jimmie sits on the bed. A great shot and why they chose to cut it up I don't know. But, you will enjoy this movie which will take you through time and beyond.",1362528000,12,1158,4.2681818181818185
312250,5,6301130391,"This movie is refreshing! The times did not indulge in hot passions but meaningful relations between couples. To me this movie had more real and suttle passion than anything I have ever seen before. This movie is a classic! His tenderness shown toward his horse was so touching. When she told him, ""You talk to animals?"" and he said ""Yes--does that bother you?"" She said ""No it doesn't."" This to me was heart warming, because she discovered that this man had compassion and tenderness. Even after killing the men who viciously raped and murdered his wife, he was remorseful. At first I thought his action was gruesome, but in the wild West at that time, people often had to take the law in their own hands right on the spot. The punishment fit the crime. The conversation in all this movie was also brilliant. If it seems boring, then the true meaning of this movie is lost. We are conditioned to movies being chocked full of action, nudity and hot sex, and because of it, this movie can be considered boring. This movie represents true life, not fantasy.",1325116800,5,1055,4.617021276595745
312251,3,6301130391,Although the movie is a bit drawn out & loses the viewer's attention; it's worth buying if u r a fan of Genevieve Bujold & James Caan,1318982400,2,133,3.962962962962963
312252,5,6301130391,"If you enjoy Genevieve Bujold, get this movie. You won't be disappointed. Unfortunately, however, Lelouch needed to add more passion to his love stories....",1167868800,3,156,5.541666666666667

7809701,5,6301130391,"This is a wonderful and moving film about the search for a new life out west.  A young couple leave Paris during the violence following Napoleon III's war with Prussia in 1870, seeking a new life in America.  The husband is a photographer and a romantic, his wife is a more practical girl who wanted to escape her life as a family bakery clerk. Their love is piercingly acute, you can see their chemistry in every gesture and scene. The parallel plot is of an American couple, with serious tensions in their marriage.  After both couples lose their respective spouses in tragic circumstances, the surviving French woman and American man meet in connection with the caretaker of their children.  Nature takes its course.

What is so interesting about this film is that it is slow paced, showing what the times are like, relying on striking imagery of people and place, all while perfectly banal things transpire.  Bujold is simply brilliant, an astonishing beauty who appears plain and poor, struggling to decide what to do with her life.  Caan is also very good as a man who must seek justice, resolving a conflict before he can move on.  It is a sad yet realistic romance, I teared up at the wonder and mystery of life.  There is some drama, but surprisingly little.  It is more about relationships and getting on with life.

Apparently, Lelouche had only a loose idea of script, giving the actors great freedom to ad lib as they formed the film as a team.  I think it is my favorite film of his.

Recommended warmly.  (FYI, I got this for $6 in a supermarket in France.)",1518048000,,1572,4.607913669064748

7809703,3,6301130391,"Wish the vendor made it clearer (in big letter, for example) that this is the French language version.  I am still looking for the English version.",1505779200,,147,4.653846153846154
7809704,5,6301130391,"This is a French film with some quirks, but it's mainly a conventional-enough Western drama and romance done with the patience and eye of a European. The story is harsh at times but mostly maintains a light touch, and is affectingly told. The characters are real and interesting.

The main story begins about 1870 in Paris after the Franco-Prussian War has reduced the city to chaos and near-starvation. A photographer and his lover leave France for the American West. About that time a veterinarian and his wife are having their first child. Eventually paths cross.

The first couple minutes, set in the West in time the film was made, make an absurd and undignified introduction that doesn't really fit with the rest in terms of tone. I suppose marks it as a story, not real, or shows the problems of an artist never change. Or something. It does introduce, in a way, the two main characters.

I might normally rate this between four and five stars, but it's been so underrated at some sites that I'll round up.

The product description says the version Amazon sells is a made-on-demand DVD in English, which means the parts originally in French have been dubbed.",1475020800,,1165,4.752475247524752
7809705,5,6301130391,"This movie pulls you in and draws you along.  I love the characters in this movie, and the twists and turns that takes place.  Sad in parts and heartwarming in other areas.  Seems true to life, with the ups and downs life brings.  As a western movie lover, I would recommend this one. James Caan plays a great part and Genevieve Bujold part in this movie is wonderful.  If you are a western lover, you will truly love this movie.  The only part that I had a hard time with was when James Caan wife dies and the way she died, but I am sure it is true to life as hard as that may be.",1452902400,,581,3.9655172413793105
7809706,4,6301130391,"Great film, but it arrived in French with subtitles not in English.",1426032000,,67,4.666666666666667
7809707,5,6301130391,"Some fault this sprawling epic Western for its long running time but I feel that the deliberate pacing adds to the film's effectiveness.  I've seen a lot of Westerns and I think the distinctive European flavor of the film adds to its appeal.  Director Claude Lelouch has crafted a work that stands up nicely next to the masterworks of other filmmakers like Ford, Leone, Peckinpah, and Eastwood.  The film is complimented by nicely turned performances by James Caan and Genevieve Bujold.  The kinetic chemistry between the two is palpable and you can cut the sensual longing their characters feel for one another with a knife.  It should be noted that their respective characters are not introduced to one another well past the film's halfway mark and don't even embrace until the closing shot and that is seen from a distance.  A unique film in many ways that will be appreciated by filmgoers willing to take a chance.",1421193600,,918,4.8152866242038215
7809708,3,6301130391,I'm a James Caan fan forever. Even the beauitful Genevieve Bujold was perfect in her role. Long drawn out in parts..but worth the money. The only thing I hated about this movie & I do mean HATED ..was in the very opening of the movie their doing a t.v.commerical with four horses pulling a car..advertising...how we have  advance since horse & buggy..showing James Caan with mustage in this part only..telling the director this is all wrong. He advises the director to come to his house so that he can show him pictures of his grandfather or great  grandfather from the 1800's how it was..then it fads into the movie in the 1800's. I still can't figure out that part of the movie..it just didn't make any sense to me. But the movie itself was slow....BUT...So real to life. Thankyou.  Jack,1402272000,,789,4.621428571428571
