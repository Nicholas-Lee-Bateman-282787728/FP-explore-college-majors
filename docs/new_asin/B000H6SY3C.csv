2629730,5,B000H6SY3C,This is a must have video for any Cardinals fan!  It has commentary from players and coaches and shows behind the scenes clips leading up to the Cardinals World Series win.  It also shows clips from past Cardinal World Series victories.  This is a video that a fan can watch over and over and still get excited about.,1168300800,,317,4.431034482758621
2629731,5,B000H6SY3C,The video is excellent.  Billy Bob does a nice job guiding you through the playoffs and the stunning 5-game upset in the World Series.  There's also some interesting commentary by TLR and some of the players.  Nice added bonus features as well.,1168300800,,244,4.761904761904762
2629732,1,B000H6SY3C,"This is a review of the DVD, not the World Series.  Please save your comments re the Series for the sports blogs.

In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic.  This DVD was made for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the full widescreen.  It has black bars on all four sides.  They may as well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio.

Also, in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly, they decided not to include footage from the season, to show nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players.  (""Gee, was it exciting to be out on the mound!"")

I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it.  Major League Baseball, as usual, cheats its fans.  Another lesson they fail to learn from Pro Football.",1164240000,12,968,4.387640449438202

Can't get enough of watching Waino finish it off and celebrate with Yadi. If you're a fan of the cards, you should own this and play it over and over again.",1330732800,,329,4.377049180327869

8137130,4,B000H6SY3C,"Although we are reviewing a DVD or VHS tape I do not think that the reviews are intended to get into technical issues about the tape or DVD.  It should to the material content, the use of editing and the drama on the field that should be mentioned.  I prefer not to worry too much about technical quality.  I don't think the differences are that great or that imprtant to mention.

This was a great year for the Tigers. Jim Leyland took over and righted the ship getting the team off to a amazingly great start that helped build their confidence in themselves and their new manager.  To come out ahead of the Yankees, Red Sox and the defending Champion Chicago White Sox was a great feat.

The Cardinal who had been humiliated by the Red Sox in 2004 were finally able to bring a championship to St Louis for an Albert Pujols led team.  But the Cardinals have the most championships of any National League teaams and the Tigers hadn't won since 1984.  But this series was one where the Tigers were dominated.",1208044800,37,1007,4.434782608695652
8137131,5,B000H6SY3C,"This is a great way to relive the Cardinals 2006 Championship, which made them the second-winningest team of all time / #1 in the NL.

Go Cards!",1194220800,,144,4.333333333333333
8137132,5,B000H6SY3C,"World Series highlight films have come a long way since the Cards' last championship in 1982. Back then, all one had to look forward to for a Series souvenir was a relatively low budget highlight reel, shot on video and narrated by the yeoman-like but predictable Mel Allen (""How 'bout that!"") or the adenoidal and ubiquitous Dick Enberg. Having not purchased one of these MLB-sanctioned curios since the `80s, this year's offering was a revelation to me. Surprisingly informative, history-conscious, well produced, appropriately paced, and nicely edited, this is a dream DVD for long-suffering Cardinals fans.

I was a bit tentative when I saw on the cover that it was narrated by a celeb, but was pleasantly surprised to find that Billy Bob Thornton is not only unobtrusive, he actually complements the visuals quite well.  Likewise, the player/coach/manager interviews are enjoyable, and it's interesting to hear their perspectives on the action we vicariously experience from our armchairs. Even the musical accompaniment is exceptional, ebbing and flowing with the action yet never overwhelming it.

Naturally, all of the Series highlights are there, as well as those of the LDS's and LCS's - including Endy Chavez's ice cream cone catch of Scott Rolen's would-be home run, Yadier Molina's very real and decisive two-run HR over the head of Chavez, and Adam Wainwright's dramatic, three-pitch strikeout of Carlos Beltran in the ninth inning of game seven of the Cards-Mets NLCS battle of attrition. Tigers fans can relive the joy of watching Magglio Ordonez's AL Pennant-clinching home run leave Comerica Park over and over again.

The rich history of Series meetings between these two flagship franchises is also acknowledged, albeit somewhat briefly, and is accompanied by commentary from Tigers great Al Kaline and Cards icon Bob Gibson.

All in all, a very satisfying package and a thorough overview of the 2006 World Series, which should please casual fans as well as insatiable Cardinals hardcores like myself.",1169251200,8,2021,5.263975155279503
8137133,5,B000H6SY3C,"Fantastic video capturing the Highlights of the World Series.  I'm, needless to say, a huge cards fan and absolutly love this video.  I just ordered the full 8 disk set and can't wait to see all of the games over again!!!!  Go Cards!",1169251200,,233,4.372093023255814
8137134,5,B000H6SY3C,"Superb.....Really captures the essence of the games, and with Billy Bob narrating it just seals the deal...A must have for Cardinal fans.",1168300800,,137,5.2727272727272725
8137135,5,B000H6SY3C,"For St. Louis Cardinals fans, a delightful review of an unexpected playoff run and World Series Championship.  For Tiger fans a reminder that all the little things count, including pitchers fielding their position.  For all of us, a reminder that under-estimated, smaller payroll teams like Detroit and St. Louis can play great baseball.  Generally well produced and lively, this DVD covers key highlights of the 2006 division, NLCS and World Series games and all of its unlikely heros (and goats).  Thorton's narration is engaging. Player interviews add context and insight.  Great for Cardinal Fans, the DVD could have been a bit more balanced in representing Tiger players and Detroit's laudable resurrection from a mere 70+ wins a season ago. To use a worn cliche`, you knew it was ""in the Cards"" when rookie Adam Wainwright, making the league minimum, strikes out Card-Killer, and multi-million dollar star Carlos Beltran on three pitches to win the NLCS for the Redbirds.  Like Boston in 2004, momentum means a lot, and this fun video has plenty of that.  Enjoy.",1168300800,5,1068,5.0685714285714285
