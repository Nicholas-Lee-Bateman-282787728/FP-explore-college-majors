It was my fault for not reading it right. It cost to much shipping to send it back,for what I paid for it, so I kept it .

1345122,4,B00004RYUY,"Released in 1957, ""Loving You"" not only represents Elvis Presley's first starring vehicle and first Technicolor extravaganza, but also his first assignment for producer Hal Wallis. After the engaging awkwardness of ""Love Me Tender,"" Elvis rips the screen open in this vibrant musical drama that parallels his rise to fame. Classic numbers include ""Mean Woman Blues,"" ""Got a Lot O' Livin' to Do"" and the smash hit ""Teddy Bear."" Nicely directed by screenwriter Hal Kanter, with good support from Lizabeth Scott, Wendell Corey and Dolores Hart. This British import features a beautifully restored print in its original VistaVision format.",1250380800,3,635,5.424242424242424
1345123,1,B00004RYUY,"I was not aware that this was a region 2 DVD when I ordered it. I have not been able to view it because I do not have a DVD player that will play these type of DVD's. I am terribly disappointed because this would have completed my entire Elvis collection. I am told that this movie is not available in region 1 format!!! Is this true?

1345126,1,B00004RYUY,"I am so disappointed with that. Didn't say anything about what region. Bought it for my dad it was the only one he don't have. And I got swindled. By law, businesses such as Amazon has to put that kind of stuff down. That is considered false advertisment.
