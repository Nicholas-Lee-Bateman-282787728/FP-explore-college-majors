8064823,5,B0009POIC2,"Lots of tips for camping and four wheeling. Some products have changed since this video was made, but the principles still apply. Well worth watching if you spend time in the outdoors. Bill Burke has a good way of explaining things. This is a different approach than other outdoor videos, though a lot of them are very good also.",1481068800,,329,4.593220338983051
8064824,5,B0009POIC2,"For us, getting ready for an off-highway trip is part of the overal fun for the trip itself. We also travel with two 4-paw drive Rovers, the Labs, so something that includes ""packing for your dog"" sparked our interest right off the bat.

If you're new to venturing off on paths less traveled or  looking for ways to improve your current game plan, this DVD will help you make the choices to have an enjoyable and safe time.

I've been camping/traveling off-highway now for longer than I care to remember. The topics covered like what to pack in a bug-out pack let alone the importance of having one, made me more aware of how to be better PREpared for our trips.

Very cool DVD.
