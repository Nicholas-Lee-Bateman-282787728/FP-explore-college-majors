8305317,5,B001GFOBSA,"Caught this film by chance on sbs tv in Australia. A well made film with a real life atmosphere. Beautiful scenery of arid landscape. Captures the tea drinking, smoking and slow pace of Iranian/Middle Eastern life very well.
Should be compulsory viewing in US,UK, and Australian schools, for 14 year olds. Might give a good insight into life in Iran and conflicts we've taken part in, for example the current long war in Afghanistan, and the reality for children within war i.e. life as a refugee. The film is not preachy, but the scenes allow us to enter into normal life. The people therefore are not foreign, but like us- they eat and smoke, talk and sleep like we do. The snapshots of battle and war, gunshots and barbed wire tell the story in a way we can digest. It is not full of blood scenes but there are constant subtle reminders.
Music and silence were used well in this film. Lovely intimate close ups of fabric, bed linen, jumpers and coats.

The everyday scenes of traditional life were entertaining, the goats and the old lady standing up to the policeman, a wedding, hunting, cooking. I liked seeing the architecture, the way everyday homes were built.
A shame this was shown on tv 11 years after being created, but perhaps I missed the first screening. Well worth seeing, and captures the energy and perspective of 14 year old boys very well.
I think this would be a good film for current affairs, geography and history in schools, as it shows a real life type of angle. It could also be a good example of storytelling for art or literature classes- to use subtle, poetic methods, to get your story told.
The ending said ""Dedicated to the children of war"".",1335657600,,1673,4.595317725752508
8305318,5,B001GFOBSA,"Seeing the world. Truly seeing the world. That's an enormous spiritual challenge these days.

We think we're holding the world in our palm 24-7 these days with our Web-enabled wireless gizmos, but the truth is: Our vision is fading. Not only are traditional news networks cutting back all around the world, but the tidal wave of media most of us consume is pretty much a hodge-podge of American popular culture.

One group consistently working against that tidal wave is the Facets team, which does a lot to improve Americans' global vision. They host the Chicago international children's film festival. And, even in very tight economic times, they keep bringing us important films from around the world.

""Delbaran"" is a great example. Produced in Iran in 2001 and recently brought to DVD for American viewers by Facets, ""Delbaran"" tells the story of a young boy trying to escape the ravages of war in Afghanistan by crossing the border into Iran. There, he finds himself living by his wits in a strange oasis -- a coffee shop and truck stop at the Delbaran border crossing.

The drama is shot in a documentary style that gives us a compelling feel for what life is like for so many of our neighbors living in that part of the world. I wound up watching portions of the film twice because the scenes were so intriguing. These images of the rough-and-tumble challenges of refugee life will stick with me for a long time.

Consider watching this film in your small group and talking about it afterward.",1231113600,8,1501,4.757692307692308
