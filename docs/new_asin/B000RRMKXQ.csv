His wish is that she stay by his side forever. This anime follows them though their day to day lives and all the craziness that implies. Belldandy has 2 sisters that are way out there. Her older sister is bent on fast tracking Belldandy's relationship with Keiichi and her little sister wants to break them up. There are also demons and classmates that have it in for them.

This anime is adapted from an older, short OVA and manga. It is more detailed and takes the story further. The animation is great, the soundtrack is fitting, and the story is very good. It's a very good anime that can be lighthearted and emotional at the same time. It's brought me lots of entertainment over the years and I hope you like it too.",1354838400,,857,4.424050632911392
