5055454,1,B00753MAXA,"Rarely am I moved to write an actual movie review, but this movie was SO BAD that I will, if only to warn people off of it. I love Jules Verne. I read unabridged copies of (English translations of) From Earth to the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth when I was only eight years old. I've read Mysterious Island, arguably my favorite Verne novel, at least a dozen times cover to cover. These are some of the best adventure stories ever written, fruit of an unfettered imagination fueled by the amazing discoveries in physics and engineering of Verne's day, a day when anything seemed possible. They are also darned good STORIES, full of rich plot and historical context (well or poorly done). They literally beg for someone to make equally unabridged movies out of them, movies that simply realize on film the story that Verne so ably tells, with the lightest of editorial hands.

Until someone does. That someone INEVITABLY decides that they are a better writer than Verne (or, in other contexts, than H. Rider Haggard, than Edgar Allan Poe, than Edgar Rice Burroughs, than H. G. Wells) and they absolutely butcher the story. The previous (1961) film version of Mysterious Island, for example, featured women in the cast and giant crabs. I'm amazed that Verne didn't return from the grave to rip off the fingers of whoever it was who wrote in such abominations.

But that version pales indeed compared to this one. Where can I even begin? The film supposedly starts in Richmond, Virginia, in civil war fields surrounded by trees festooned with Spanish Moss.

Excuse me? Spanish Moss? Really? I've lived in Virginia for almost a decade of my life, in North Carolina for four decades, driven through Richmond and visited it dozens of times.  There isn't any Spanish Moss growing in a tree in Virginia ANYWHERE short of Virginia Beach on the coast next to the NC border, and it is rare even there. You don't find it even in North Carolina anywhere but at the coast (there's none of it in Durham, well over 100 miles south of Richmond, for example) and near the South Carolina border. You don't find trees decked out like the ones in the film north of South Carolina, and I wouldn't be surprised if those scenes where shot by a California Yankee in Georgia or Florida somewhere far, far from Virginia.

I gritted my teeth and tried to suspend disbelief, hoping that this was just a rough patch and that this version would indeed still be the one I fervently await, one that just presents Verne's story, with Verne's characters, Verne's plot, Verne's animals, on Verne's vision of the island. Believe me, the story is strong enough to stand being perfectly linearly translated into film. No crabs or clumsily inserted female characters need apply, giant or otherwise, no matter how romantic or politically correct it might be.

Ha, ha, silly me. The story starts ""in Richmond"" (it tells us that on the screen, although we never see as much as a building that might conceivably be part of Richmond, and the first scene resembles nothing whatsoever found in the actual book where the prisoners are literally wandering around town). In THIS movie A bunch of soldiers are marching through a country field escorting a bunch of prisoners. The prisoners are revealed to be -- Verne's cast, sort of. Herbert, Neb, Cyrus Harding. Pencroft has transmogrified into ONE OF THE REBEL GUARDS (who is angry and violent and racist, nothing like Pencroft in the real story). A rebel deserter en route to his execution has been ""mysteriously"" grafted onto the cast as one of the prisoners. Gideon Spillett joins them through some clumsy artifice.

Suddenly, cannonballs explode nearby. Chaos!  The guards are down! Escape! Spillett leads them to -- a balloon (still no sign of anything vaguely resembling a human habitation, let alone a city, this is being shot in some farmer's field somewhere)! Off into the skies! Hooray, maybe they'll kill off the deserter and somehow return to Verne's story line.

No such luck. The very next scene has Gideon Spillett shot dead, not the add-on cast member. Pencroft (the rebel guard) has somehow hung onto the balloon and Spillett is killed in the ensuing fight once he gets on board. Damn, it's going to be hard to get back to Verne's story now,  isn't it, with one of the main characters gone (two if you include Top, and personally I very much would include Top), a new character, and a character that shares nothing but a name with Verne's cast.

Naturally, the next scene has the balloon swept into a transdimensional spacetime warp that just happens to open up in the stormy Georg-- I mean ""Virginia"" skies and everybody blacks out. Globe-spanning storms (Verne's artifice) are too likely, I suppose, too passe, we need space aliens or black holes or plain old tinkerbell magic.  Naturally, they wake up on a beach, and -- Harding is missing.

At this point I'm openly weeping, of course. I mean the pain is visceral. But the director toys with me this one last time -- maybe, just maybe, after this absolutely absurd beginning we will return to Verne's excellent story and abandon this low budget self-abusive mental fantasy that the screenwriter is more talented than one of the most amazing writers of all science fictiondom, if only they get to plagiarize the name to suck in the unwary. I keep watching through a haze of pain.

After some egregious and clumsy attempts to make the film modern and relevant by using Pencroft as a foil for some sort of statement about racial prejudice (but oh so delicately, no use of the ""n""-word here) we hear animal noises coming from the jungle behind the beach. Oh no! Giant Crabs! Or something. The rebel coward Christian deserter (cannon fodder from day one) sneaks into the brush at night, where we are treated to the usual cry of surprise
when the noises that sound like a large, dangerous animal turn out to be -- a large dangerous animal!  Totally in character, right, for a coward. Next morning the survivors find his eviscerated remains.  They may not use the ""n"" word as it might unexpectedly offend viewers of a film set in the middle of the Civil War, but the director has no objection to piles of steaming intestines with a blood-smeared cross perched on top (so we can identify the otherwise unrecognizable mess as the deserter).

At this point I'm reaching for the button that will send this movie to where the lights go when the lights go out, to oblivion. I'm trying to make myself tap it gently instead of smashing the brand new Galaxy Tab on which I am watching in rage and frustration -- anything to make it stop.

Before I can get there, the last scene that plays out on the screen, one that is emblazoned on my memory now as I tell this story to you to try to help you keep from making the horrible mistake that I myself made, conned into twenty minutes of agonizing torment under the delusion that this movie shares some memetic content with the superb work from which it righteously stole the name, is -- wait for it -- a SOUTHERN MANSION (one that no doubt just happened to be handy in this low budget piece of .... right next to the fields where they shot the original scenes) on this ""mysterious"" ""island"" that is probably somewhere in Mississippi or Louisiana or on the Georgia coast.

The screen finally darkens and goes silent, my trembling hand gropes for my beer, for Valium, for a syringe full of uncut heroin, anything to make me forget.

The Horror. The Horror.

If only life had a ""delete forever, and pretend that it never ever existed"" button. That's how bad it is. Don't watch it.

The production and effects are ok. I really wanted to see how they addressed Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, but I was disappointed there. The acting is ok. If you like Scifi, you might want to watch it once, just to say you saw it. This might have been a ""made for TV"" movie from the look of it.

This film combines Mysterious Island, and Bermuda Triangle time travel with morlocks (from Well's ""Time Machine"") into one film and does so rather poorly.

The film deals with issues of race, but does so as a ""now vs then"" scenario. Gina Holden and Susie Abromeit provide the token eye candy as women aviators from 2012 named Fogg. Phileas Fogg was a Verne character from ""Around the World in 80 Days."" Toss in Captain Nemo (William Morgan Sheppard) from ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and a giant octopus that prevents any ship from leaving and I think you get the idea. In movies, not all gumbo is good.

The acting was not great. The dialogue was faux-drama. The special effects weren't. The movie ended with a sequel in mind (good luck with that). This film might work for preteens, although the 1961 version keeps looking better with time.

5055496,3,B00753MAXA,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2012 and directed by Mark Sheppard, ""Mysterious Island"" is loosely based on Jules Vernes book about Civil War soldiers stranded on a strange island and their eventual encounter with Captain Nemo (played by William Morgan Sheppard and, in flashbacks, Mark Sheppard). Gina Holden & Susie Abromeit play two women the soldiers meet on the island. Lochlyn Munro is effective as the male protagonist while Edrick Browne, Caleb Michaelson & J.D. Evermore appear as other soldiers.

Ive seen two other movies based on Vernes novel (1961 & 2005) and those departed from the novel as well, although this one takes the most liberties. As my title blurb points out, the castaways aren't just lost on a deserted island, they're lost in time too and I enjoyed the ramifications of this (Civil War-era militarists trying to catch a grip with two modern women). If you're a sucker for lost-on-deserted-island movies, like me, this version is a must, as long as you can handle the TV budget. The only noticeable flaw (beyond the typical limitations that go with a low budget) is the awkward way some scenes are executed, like the final one with Herbert.

THE FILM RUNS 91 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana (St. Amant, St. Gabriel, Mandeville & Baton Rouge). WRITER: Cameron Larson.

5055846,4,B00753MAXA,A decent movie for young adults and their parents - sort of similar to no version of Jules Verne I've ever seen before but believable .

5055852,1,B00753MAXA,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I turned it off after 20-30 minutes. Every possible aberration of the plot was rammed in there. I'm surprised  the women weren't topless. Do studios do movies like this to fail so they can write it off on their taxes? If I could have submitted with no stars I would have. This was terrible.,1466294400,,330,4.32258064516129

We also have a pair of ladies from our time to provide a little sexual interest.
The filming is obviously video tape with primitive effects.
The most disconcerting error which kept jerking me out of my suspension of belief was the confederate soldiers wearing modern crew neck thermal shirts in stead of the homespun cotton that would have been more authentic.

But aside from begrudgingly using Captain Nemo in their retelling, that's as far as the similarities go.  In this mild adventure, a small group escapes the ravages of the civil war in a balloon that gets sucked into a purple portal where they eventually find themselves deposited on THE mysterious island.  They soon realize they are being hunted by unseen `creatures' in the jungle.  The first to go missing finds himself on the wrong end of a potluck dinner.  Before you can say holy Hannah, a flying locomotive crashes, depositing two sisters lost in time and space!!!  There's also a sea beastie with an attitude, a volcano, and the mystery of the creatures from the jungle is solved after another member becomes an entree.  Late in the game, Nemo shows up to lay claim to the creation of the Bermuda Triangle.  He insists there is no escape from this island.

For an action adventure, there is relatively little action and almost no adventure.  They simply stage a scene here and there, on one day or the next, where the group stands around talking about what to do.  Every so often, something happens with little or no excitement.  Days fly by, sometimes a single scene constituting that day's events.  It's almost always difficult to make something sound exciting simply by talking about it.

It's only saving grace was that I found it preposterously amusing.  (I love how they made the DVD cover illustration a b-zillion times more exciting than the movie.)

Oh yeah, there's an appearance relatively late in the film by the famous Captain Nemo,  who accidentally created the portal with a nuclear device while trying to escape the grip of what appears to be a giant squid with 500 foot long arms.  I'm not kidding.  Plenty references to, golly, the fact that the North won the war and now the United States is, like, the best place in the world.  And the special, or ""not-so-special"" effects are dreadful.  The end of the movie had the few surviving cast members using a time machine to escape the island with no conclusive result.

For that alone, this movie loses a couple points.  Beyond that, it is your run of the mill, low budget, cheesy science fiction type movie which may have a few decent moments, but generally is mediocre across the board.  It loses one more star for the audacity to claim ""Jules Verne's"" right in the title, as if it is really faithful to the original story.

The plot is what I call a ""sieve plot"", meaning it has more holes than substance. I had questions from the first ten minutes on and not one of them was asked by the 1895 crew. For example, I still want to know why no notice was taken by Civil War Era guys re: the attire of the two 21st Century ladies. There are just too many puzzles to list, really, but if you're into collecting film incongruities, ""Mysterious Island"" (which is by no possible definition Jules Verne's) this is the place to go.

In spite of the bewildering inclusion of three established, respectable and competent  actors (Pruitt Taylor Vince, Mark Sheppard and William Morgan Sheppard), the characters are two dimensional at best and really... nobody cares much what happens to them. I can't really blame the cast, though. They're victims of some of the silliest writing outside of the neighborhood kids' plays our parents suffered through. When the economy goes toes up you do whatcha gotta do. Speaking of economy, the meager budget...if an estimated 2,500,000 is ""meager"" and I guess it is...becomes evident with the island monsters which consist of people wearing XL Ewok suits. It's one of the rare times I've actually missed a dollop of cheesy CGI.

8510318,3,B00753MAXA,as a sci-fi movie not bad but if you are a fan of the one you watch on tv its  will disappoint you.,1526083200,,99,3.3043478260869565
8510319,1,B00753MAXA,"I would have given it 2 stars just for novelty and being entertaining in a lazy, low-key sort of way....but the non-ending was absurd. NO resolution. I wish I had not watched it. In fact, I'm pi***d at the lack of resolution.

In a different vehicle, some of the actors could have done a better job.",1525392000,,299,4.339285714285714

8510323,2,B00753MAXA,"A mash-up of ""The Mysterious Island"" and ""Lost"" that isn't good. I'm not sure why ""Jules Verne's"" was added to the title when this movie clearly takes umpteen liberties with the French writer's original story. Even funnier is how one of the female characters is named Jules, as if the producers are trying to pay their respects to Verne.",1519948800,,337,4.728813559322034
8510324,1,B00753MAXA,"If you have never read the book, it would be a movie to watch when there is nothing else available. If you have read the book, it is a colossal disappointment. On par with a 1950s B horror film. The plot resembled the book in that there was an island, Cyrus Harding was the main character (of sorts), and Captain Nemo was present.
It was a tolerable comedy, and you'll keep watching for the same reason you cannot look away from an obese man in a speedo - morbid curiosity - and to find out out badly they stray from the story.",1519948800,,527,4.176470588235294
8510325,1,B00753MAXA,"Given some of the cast in this movie, I'm really surprised at how cheap the production was.  It was really poorly produced, most of the cast couldn't seem to act,  and the music was generic and loud all the way through, often overriding the voice acting with it's volume.",1519516800,,271,4.510204081632653
8510326,2,B00753MAXA,The acting was was pretty dam good.  The story took us nowhere except through time with no ending,1518998400,,97,4.388888888888889
