You won't get HDTV video quality.  In 1997, we still watched old-school analog low-resolution 4:3 aspect TVs.  Coming from tape masters, the quality isn't quite as good as the original live broadcast that we all remember, but its a lot better than anything youll see on Youtube and itll look OK on your big-screen HDTV.  Select the pre-race option and the program will auto-play all content, the entire original broadcast, until the post-show wrap-up.  Ignore Amazon's ""90 minute"" Run Time in their product details header.  Pre-race, post race--it's all there.

The late, great, Buddy Baker provided race commentary during the original CBS Sports broadcast.  A whos who of NASCAR champions including Lebonte brothers Terry and Bobby, Bill Elliott, Darrell Waltrip, Dale Jarrett, and Rusty Wallace compete in a race in which weather dealt a wildcard.  The big question on everybodys mind during this race was whether or not seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt could score his first win of Americas Race after eighteen straight losses.

1997s Daytona 500 was simply amazing and the original CBS broadcast captured every moment.  If you're a Jeff Gordon fan, this DVD is a must-have.  This race was Jeffs first Daytona 500 victory.  He went on to win the 1997 Winston Cup championship.

Dale Earnhardt fans will appreciate this DVD as well.  Although he lost this one after a hairy crash in which his #3 Goodwrench car careened down the track on its roof, Earnhardt famously exited the ambulance and practically pushed the tow truck aside to get his wrecked car back to pit row for repairs.  With his characteristic grit and determination, he finished the race in 31st place with a little help from his pit crew and a lot of NASCAR duct tape--which literally held the car together.  The happy ending to yet another star-crossed Daytona 500 loss for Earnhardt was next years race.  In 1998, Dale Earnhardt finally added a Daytona 500 victory to his legendary record.

Watch veteran racer Buddy Bakers Ive never seen that before response as Robert Pressleys #29 Chevrolet pirouettes down the infield on its nose.  Landing the car hard on all four wheels, Pressley was sent to the hospital and Todd Bodine took his place, driving the car back on the track to finish the race in 39th place.  You have to see it to believe it.

Watch Sterling Martin accidentally run down one of his pit crew.  Such a tangle with a car would send most of us to a hospital, but jack man Wayne Jankies doesnt skip a beat, jumping back up to perform his job well enough to help propel Martin to a 5th place finish.

A jubilant Jeff Gordon and a disappointed Dale Earnhardt, Sr provide some great interviews post-race.  While the video quality isn't up to 21st Century standards, you won't be sorry you added this race to your DVD collection.  You'll want to watch it over and over!",1462147200,,3016,4.828460038986354
