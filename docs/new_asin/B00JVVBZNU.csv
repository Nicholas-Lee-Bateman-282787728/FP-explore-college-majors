6395108,5,B00JVVBZNU,"I've looked everywhere for this, and I'm really glad to add this to my collection!

6395112,5,B00JVVBZNU,any bleach fan would love this double feature and how hard to get the first movie is it is great,1417910400,,96,3.85

6395114,5,B00JVVBZNU,I use to have both movies on DVD but due to my little nephews they were unplayable so when I seen this deal I couldn't resist. The price even dropped from when I first pre-ordered the item. I am a Prime member so it arrived for free on the release date as always.,1409702400,2,263,3.981132075471698
6395115,5,B00JVVBZNU,"This two disk set is a departure for Viz, who wants every cent you have and exploits American taste for anime by charging top dollar. I must admit, these two movies are my favorites of the four Bleach movies I've seen. In an affordable twofer, they are a must have for Bleach collecters.  Another thing about Bleach movies is the fights don't last for eternity and we can get on with the storyline. One gripe, though, it is annoying how Viz cleans up language and content for western audiences when we would rather have the graphic language and content included.  A If it is good enough for the Japanese audiences it's good enough for the western ones. Moms  who gripe can buy things more suited for their kids and leave the more adult themed vids to the older kids/adults. One more thing English actors need to brush up on Japanese pronunciations of names, places and things,and stop butchering the pronunciation of said things.",1407369600,4,929,4.6871165644171775

6395122,5,B00JVVBZNU,"I got mine Bleach the Movie on two disks. It has no scratches on both disks that they are new, and it reads great. The shipping is arrived in 3 days, I think. Thank you so much. I enjoy it.",1466467200,,189,3.75
6395123,4,B00JVVBZNU,"The Diamond Dust Rebellion movie is really good, it had it's epic fights, and I like the ideas about zanpakuto, and Central 46 rulings, I thought the writing was a lot better than most of the Bleach anime. Memories of Nobody was okay, I didn't particularly care for the ideas behind some of the characters, and the writing was not as good as some of the Bleach anime, which is fairly low to begin with.

Both movies have top notch animation, and they both have the option to be watched in English dubs, or Japanese dubs with English subtitles. The bundle is worth the Diamond Dust Rebellion movie alone, the Memories of Nobody is just a small bonus.",1461628800,4,649,4.5
