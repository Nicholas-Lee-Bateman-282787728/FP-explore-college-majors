8468719,1,B005EMZ5WW,"I understand that some 20-somethings use profanity a great deal, but that doesn't mean I want to watch a movie written by someone who can't come up with anything more original than an F bomb every 2nd or 3rd word constantly.  Actually, I can't say that it occurs throughout the whole movie because I had to stop watching after 20 minutes of this predictable garbage.",1524700800,,366,4.630769230769231
8468720,5,B005EMZ5WW,Maybe it's because I raise my daughter and son by myself or because my best road trips I were with my adult daughter that I gave this movie five stars instead of four.  Regardless it's totally endearing and heartwarming movie for young and old adults.,1514160000,,251,4.5777777777777775
8468721,3,B005EMZ5WW,"Solidly different. Fairly adequate execution of a quirky film. I liked the main character and enjoyed the editing around the narrator, but could not stand some of the secondary characters and scenarios. Overall, it achieves trying to say something while saying nothing at all.",1499385600,,276,5.295454545454546
8468722,5,B005EMZ5WW,Great film that breaks into the way a guy in the gamers life views growing up finally for things we want and facing the fears we have. Plus great comedy and slight lil jokes.,1490486400,,174,4.147058823529412
8468723,5,B005EMZ5WW,"great indi-film! If you're in your late twenties or early thirties, you'll certainly identify.  There's a great scene with a red square that I've been quoting for years.",1450483200,,169,5.035714285714286
8468724,5,B005EMZ5WW,I enjoyed this earlier production by Larry who has recently produced THE MURDERS OF BRANDYWINE THEATER.,1416614400,,103,5.5
8468725,5,B005EMZ5WW,"This is a humorous ""coming of age"" story about Ben Baker (Larry Longstreth). Ben drinks, smokes pot and works at a video game store. He is an adult living as a teen, playing D &D. Ben is smart, but an underachiever. His girlfriend Donna (Marisa Zakaria) is bored with his ways and leaves. Ben remakes himself to get her back, becoming the type of guy he hates. He has trouble adjusting, not knowing if he would be happier selling out and conforming to what Donna wants him to be, or just being himself without Donna. The movie symbolically shows Ben's dilemma with the blue square question.

I loved the metaphor of the blue square. The dialouge was 5 stars. The plot maintained my interest. The acting was...well I think they all got stoned and played themselves. It is a story for those of us who grew up late.

Frequent f-bombs, off screen sex, no nudity. Entertaining and clever like a good indie.",1335830400,3,901,4.555555555555555
8468726,5,B005EMZ5WW,the long slow death of a twenty something is a look at a stage of life we stare down. Larry Longstreth brings together a wounderful cast to convey a story that been told a thousand times as well as never before.great acting and spot on direction show us just how painful and funny running head first into your thirtys can be.,1317513600,,325,4.344262295081967
8468727,5,B005EMZ5WW,"The Long Slow Death of a Twenty-Something is funny at all the right times, and serious at all the right times. It reflects how many, if not all, of us have felt when we begin to wonder what world we really belong to. The movie is very well written, and the actors and actresses deliver their characters expertly. It will give you plenty to think about at the end, while still presenting a fair amount of closure. I would definitely recommend this movie!",1313366400,2,453,4.469879518072289
