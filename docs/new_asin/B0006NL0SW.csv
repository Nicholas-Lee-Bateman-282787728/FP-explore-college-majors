8041918,5,B0006NL0SW,"I didn't think that I really needed to change my behavior about alcohol, but after watching this DVD, I realized that my addictive behavior in general, be it alcohol, money, food or relationships, could use some adjusting. So if you have a question about whether this video will be helpful for you, my guess is that it will.  Having watched this DVD, I wanted to leave a review partly to respond to the comment that this video is boring. The video series is not a bunch of Disney movies trying to have a moral, nor are they high budget Hollywood production films of meaningless fluff. What is in this DVD is an amazing amount of insight that will come in handy for anyone who is trying to overcome an addiction, has a loved one with an addiction, or is trying to learn something on the subject.",1236470400,,794,4.438356164383562
8041919,5,B0006NL0SW,I found this video extremely helpful and decided to purchase it after seeing it on NetFlix.,1233273600,,91,4.75
8041920,5,B0006NL0SW,"As a substance abuse counselor, I showed my clients this presentation that Mr. Gazley gave on the topic of chemical dependence.  They all said  how good this video was.

The video lecture is easy to follow and Mr. Gazley explains everything as he goes along.  He uses diagrams and other visuals to help the viewer understand better the process of addiction.  I will buy more of Mr. Gazley's videos in the future.  Highly recommended for those in recovery.",1231286400,2,455,4.769230769230769
8041921,1,B0006NL0SW,If you can sit through this lecture it is informative.  I lost interest after 10 minutes.  I know new addicts in sobriety couldn't sit still through this.  The movie is slow moving.  No real interaction with others.  I purchased this video after reading the reviews and I am only reviewing this so others don't make the same mistake I made.,1193443200,5,340,4.6
8041922,5,B0006NL0SW,This is a great down-to-earth and accurate tool for coping with chemical dependence.,1109980800,,84,5.538461538461538
8041923,5,B0006NL0SW,"I used it on a conference I gave to people who had problems with chemical abuse, and all of them gave me an excellent feedback about what they saw in the video. I found it very useful and instructive.",1103760000,6,200,4.153846153846154
8041924,5,B0006NL0SW,I learned a lot.  The information is presented in a very comprehensible manner.  Chemical dependency made sense to me for the very first time in my life.,1101427200,3,153,4.62962962962963
