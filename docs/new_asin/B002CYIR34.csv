3907420,5,B002CYIR34,"This is no joke, and I am not exagerating. director mike dougherty's horror vision is one of the clearest and greatest we have seen in many years. A true breath of fresh air in the horror genre, not since 1996's SCREAM has the horror world been abuzz and giddy with excitement over the arrival of this film.

  set on a hallow's eve/halloween night, stories of horror and mystery abound, all tied together by a little halloween ""character"" named sam, who is not what he seems, in a truely terrifying yet wonderful way.

 DO NOT DELAY IN ORDERING THIS!  you will not regret it .one of the absolute gems in all of horror, in a genre that is so filled with retreads and dissapointments, TRICK R TREAT is the five star ""treat"" of all.",1250380800,42,730,4.451127819548872

3907456,5,B002CYIR34,"So I finally saw the horror film that has been recommended to me for years.  Trick 'r Treat.  It had been described to me fairly well and I already had a feeling I would like Sam (A play on the spelling of Samhain, The literal spirit of Halloween) before it even started but it exceeded my expectations.  I had seen parts of it before on things like Syfy, such as the segment with the stingy old man (who turned out to be a certain bus driver).

I was pleasantly surprised. Sam is definitely on my list of favorite new classic monsters.  Right up there with Freddy Krueger.  It felt like a 1980s horror film (in a very good way).  The effects were mostly practical and I noticed subtle homages like Rosaleen's version of the Red Riding Hood dress in The Company of Wolves.  I really liked Trick 'r Treat. It's unique, creative, and yet familiar and in my opinion it's far more worthy of being a Halloween tradition than the Saw franchise.",1509408000,,938,4.412790697674419

3907461,1,B002CYIR34,"Nope.  The movie makers tried, they really tried, bless their little hearts, but it's a fail.  Not funny, not scary.  Some of the special effects are good and some of the makeup is good but the entire thing fails.",1508803200,,213,4.410256410256411
3907462,5,B002CYIR34,"Although this is not my favorite horror movie, it is always my favorite for Halloween. It's scary and spooky and a bit gory, but also quite fun! Would not recommend for kids who still go trick or treating.... my daughter wouldn't eat her candy for a couple years after watching this. The movie is not just a horror story with a Halloween backdrop, it is about Halloween and its traditions. So unique and delightful. Would love a sequel if it is this good. The story of the kids on the bus was quite creepy and the visuals are fantastic. Highly recommended if you love Halloween like I do!",1508716800,,588,4.453703703703703

3907472,1,B002CYIR34,"No.

Just... NO.

Preview looks good, quality editing, good focus and video. Once we purchased and started watching, it was like the trailer was edited by a pro, but the movie UTTERLY SUCKS.

The acting looked potentially campy and fun, the story looked like it might be a lot of fun, even if a bit schlocky.

NOPE. What a disappointment. I love LOVE Plan 9 From Outer Space and a lot of cheesy flicks - they're good for a laugh! This one wasn't even good for THAT.

Absolute GARBAGE. Not one redeeming frame of footage, not one redeeming line of script, not a damn good thing to say.",1507420800,,584,4.37037037037037

3907477,4,B002CYIR34,"Really, I do LOVE this movie, but a few uneven elements (mostly related to the various bus-legend pieces) held it to 4 stars for me. Well, that and the absence of any connection to the Headless Horseman legends did, but I'm aware that is a personal obsession rather than a true cinematic flaw. Truly, the tricks on offer make this darn close to a perfect Halloween treat, and it's a must-see-then-repeat-repeatedly-forevermore delight, as those who found it hiding in the shadows despite theater-release issues discovered. That's how it became a lauded and loved cult classic, but now that Universal Halloween Horror Nights 27 is dedicating the most traditional, atmospheric and absolute best scare zone space to the property, I was inspired to come give a review for any curious newcomers that exposure might bring here. Because saying too much about each story could keep the tricks and traps from springing in spoiler-free fashion, I won't give a complete rundown and rating of each segment with too much detail. What I do want to note is that this is NOT the kind of slasher pic heavy on gore and overt torture porn that has unfortunately taken over what most younger people consider the very definition of a horror movie; it's leagues above that schlock! What makes Trick 'r Treat special is that it somehow manages simultaneously to keep the feel of a small-town, Americana Halloween, give nods to the hits that drove the evolution of the horror genre across decades, and yet be so thoroughly modern it still feels fresh a decade down the road! I'm also obsessed fan of An AmericaI n Werewolf in London, which is still king as the best werewolf movie ever, but if you ask me to name the best and most terrifying werewolf depiction, it's hands down the relevant scene in this movie! You get every breath-catching, spine-shivering feeling of being right there, holding still as though the hot breath and drool over those canines could snap at you if you even flinch, and yet you also can't bear to look away, as the awesome power on display is just astounding!!! Of course, that's why this movie is so effective. The traditions in the very human holiday of Halloween have always combined fear of death and scary apex predators and revelry in being scary apex predators, and this movie skillfully plays to both aspects in ways no other film in the genre does!",1506038400,,2362,4.791666666666667

3907511,3,B002CYIR34,"Just ""OKAY"". Some parts are hard to understand, and it jumps around a lot. You may need to watch it twice to fully get an understanding.

Four stories that all are supposed to culminate into one. Seemed to have potential, but it was hard for me to ""get"".  Was the old man at the end supposed to be the bus driver, with one of the ""victims"" coming back to seek revenge?  I don't know.  Speaking of the bus driver, that leads me to the scene with the 5 children telling the story of the bus accident on Halloween night 30 years previous.  They all walk down to a an old quarry and lake to tell the story of the bus accident and the children victims.  You really don't get a grasp if the it is just the kids telling a story, or if it really happened.  You see scenes of the ""victims"" seemingly coming back to life 30 years later to scare the kids, but then the kids tell one of their friends they are just goofing around?  Maybe I need to watch again, but I never understood this part.

Another part that seemed to make no sense is the scene where the vampire falls out of the tree and one of the early 20's girls (from another storyline - with the 4 friends going to a Halloween party) and she attacks him and one of them morphs into a werewolf.  I didn't ""get"" this, either.

I will have to watch again.  To summarize though - it's OKAY (I paid 4.99 for it used at FYE at the mall, so not a big loss!) but you may be confused on trying to understand certain parts or how it all ties together.  I recommend at least watching twice before forming your final opinion.",1489968000,,1563,4.135761589403973

I waited a long long long time to see this movie as it sat on a shelf for years and years. I heard about it during all that time and was very excited to see it. Im not sure if info was ever released as to WHY it kept getting pushed back other then they had a few screen testings and decided after them to not release the movie, especially when online reviews at the time really praised the film. Maybe it was with the success of Anna Paquin and True Blood that finally got the ball rolling who knows?

From what I recall it was described as being a horror movie based on Halloween, and it would be like an anthology just like Creepshow, or Tales from the Crypt, and that it was gory and spooky. What it ended up being was more of a childs story and so I was pretty disappointed going into it. Perhaps if I had known (or rather remembered) that it had that childlike feel to it I wouldnt have been so disappointed. But one gets very high hopes for a movie when they hear about how good it was for years and years.

Now a year later, knowing what Im was getting into, and it being the start of Fall and close to the Halloween season I decided to give the movie another try. This review is based on my second impression of the film.

Halloween is by far one of my favorite Holidays, and the best time of year. I LOVE Fall, the leaves, the smell, the pumpkins, the chill in the air. But the best part about Halloween for me, is the decorations and costumes. This movie has plenty. The Halloween imagery is amazing in this film. Especially the front yard with all the Jack O Lanterns. Its amazing. The Halloween feeling in this movie really reminded me of when I was a child/teen/Young Adult in New England.

Another thing that I really liked about this movie was the fact that Halloween lore is ALL over the film. We get descriptions from some of the kids, and the principal even mentions different things about Halloween and how kids today don't appreciate it or in some cases don't even know about lore surrounding Halloween. Its sad, but its true. Shoot in most schools these days they won't allow you to dress up. I remember dressing up in elementary school and touring the school with our classes to show off our costumes. Its almost frowned upon in some areas to even celebrate! What a shame.

But, getting back to the movieThis movie is a bunch of short little stories. Wrapped around to fit into one main story. Basically while each story is going on, so are other stories and we see little events in each story that feature different main characters from the other stories. Got that? Okay!

The intro story we get is a man and woman come home from somewhere in costume. The woman doesnt like Halloween and wants to undecorate their very decorated lawn. One of them ends up murdered by an unseen assailant. We are then taken to earlier that eveningWhere we discover there is a huge Halloween parade/event going on in town. It looks similar to Mardi Gras but Halloween stylewe eventually see these two characters and the quite a few of the other main characters there.

Then we meet up with four young ladies at a costume store dressing up and having a good time. They discuss meeting dates and going to a party. They too make their way through the street party, eventually splitting up from one of the girls and heading out to their own party. From there on we mainly see the adventure of the one character, and it has a nice spin to it just like the other stories.

Then we meet a chubby little kid, Charlie, taking a bunch of candy from the steps of a house. Turns out this is the school principals house, and apparently he moonlights as a killer in the evenings. Hes got a little more going for him then we know. He appears in one of the other stories as well.

There is also a group of kids going door to door trick r treating collecting jack o lanterns. They end up heading to where the Halloween School Bus Massacre took place. Its a town legend where a bunch of children were killed. During this time we see a flashback to show us the story as one of the kids talks about it. Our trick r treating children have brought the jack o lanterns as an offering to the children whove died there.

Last but not least, the story about the old man who lives next door to the principals house. Turns out hes someone from one of the other stories. 90% of this story I did not like as this story involves Sam.

 I think all the anticipation, and all the great reviews really ruined thoughts on this film the first time around. My expectations were sky high. I was expecting to feel a classic 80s horror film. But in the end it felt like a made for TV childrens horror movie. So what did I think the 2nd time around? I liked it. However, even with the language, the nudity, and gore, it still has that childish feel to it. In the end I wish that it had been a movie that was around when I was a kid. Since I didn't care for the final story with Sam I have to dock a star from the rating.",1487894400,,5079,4.278125

3907622,5,B002CYIR34,"What do you do when you can't sleep and its 2am.
I saw this movie on a movie channel last year and while it is a little cornball I have to say it has become my instant favorite halloween movie.
No spoilers here.
This movie intertwines 4 different stories that if you go back you can see all of them happening in the background of the other stories.
While it is a bit gruesome in some places, in the end you'll come to love its little villain ""Sam"" as the story unfolds and gives you more insight into our little halloween gate keeper.
Truly this movie will become a halloween classic. The characters while somewhat over the top all come together as believable and fun, with a little bit of OMG mixed in.
This is not for the young ones either, but everyone else, go for it.
One last thing, always obey the rules of halloween, especially if Sam is around",1477008000,6,852,4.298136645962733

film critics and horror enthusiasts who's opinions I respect such as John Schnepp, Clarke Wolfe, and Mark Reilly about Trick 'r Treat and how scary/creepy it was but I was disappointed. Nowhere near as scary as I anticipated. Not a bad film by any means but just not scary like I was looking forward to. My real score is a 2.5 out of 5 but this is only allowing me to give it a 2 or 3 so I'll give it a 3.",1476921600,,437,3.9213483146067416

3907650,5,B002CYIR34,"I'm a bit in love with this film! For me it is perfect and everything I want from a scary movie. Expertly written & directed by Michael Dougherty this is an original, funny, suspenseful, clever, twisted and beautiful film. The intertwined narrative involves 5 stories taking place in the same town Halloween night & each story, while separate, overlap in surprising ways. Following the opening story is an awesome opening title sequence that sets up the film as a pulpy ""tales of terror"" style comic book. The narrative structure, both directing & editing, is executed expertly & begs multiple viewings just to pick up on the myriad of details through out. Too many horror flicks use a subdued, dirty palette to set tone but 'TRICK 'r TREAT's' cinematography by Glen MacPherson is rich & gorgeous with bright colors cutting through the contrasting dark shadows. Every frame a beautiful composition! There is no primary character except for the mysterious Sam in his burlap mask & orange PJs who is present in each story line. The true main character is Halloween itself and this film embraces the holiday like no other. The score composed by Douglas Pipes is lush, suspenseful & frightening conjuring the best of Jerry Goldsmith & Danny Elfman while carving out its own original sound. I'll cover some other scary flicks but 'TRICK 'r TREAT' receives my highest recommendation. Remember to keep your jack-o-lanterns lit as you watch!",1475366400,,1433,5.0

One big error is when a man pulls a knife from a pumpkin, it makes a metal knife sharpening sound.

amazing how many think this is good horror! this is typical new Hollyweird garbage! If you want good horror start with the 30's Universal
Collection then work your way thru the 50's thru 70's Hammer Horror collection then move into 70's TV shows like Night Gallery and
Ghost Stories and Kolchak the Night Stalker etc....then your ready for the last of the great horror movies like Fright Night, Creepshow
1 and 2, Salem's Lot, Food of the Gods, Tales of the Crypt, House of the Long Shadows, Lady in White, Magic, IT, The Hitcher, The
Thing, Chambers of Horrors, Race with the Devil, American Werewolf in London, Monster Club, Monster Squad etc... movies with real acting, directing and real scary horror not must gore violence sex and special effects. You can't appreciate good horror without watching the classics and Hollyweirdhas no idea what a good horror movie is anymore! Except the fantastic Super 8! which was the horror sci fi movie that
had great writing and directing and more amazing the kids in the movie were all great! It was like watching an 80's movie. May be the
last great horror sci fi movie made forever! or at least the last 20 years from Hollyweird. I don't see another one coming soon.",1450828800,,1353,4.595041322314049

Fast forward to 2013.  I had went into my local rent shop and saw this on the ""Favorites"" selection (stretching the word ""favorite"") and thought ""I'll give this another go,"" and rented it.

Oh, was I upset.

You can skip the spoilers, which are clearly marked, so don't get mad if I spoiled it for you.  You read at your own discretion.

[SPOILERS]

First story was about a murderous principle who killed kids with poisoned candy bars (somehow they were professionally wrapped Snickers bars, which this man was nowhere near professional) and buried them in his backyard after decapitating them.  Disgusting vomit fest with the kid who ate the poisoned candy bar (knew that was gonna happen).  The principle's kid is also in on it (what a twist!) as they attempt to carve the dead kid's head as a Jack-o-lantern.

Second story gets a nice comic-like style segway (only cool part of this movie, really, are the comic book style segways) to some kids playing a prank on one another about a short bus that was run off a cliff into quarry, because the parents paid the bus driver to do in their mentally challenged children (totally realistic) and they say the quarry is haunted by these dead children.  We all know what happens.  The kids get murdered by the dead children and we have to listen to gut wrenching splatter noises and squelches as one traumatized kid walks out of the quarry (could have just done with the kids screaming in horror and no gory noises).

Third story (again, nice comic transition) and we meet up with some girls going to a costume party for the night.  One girl runs into a vampire guy (who turns out to be the screwed up principle from the first story) and she leads him to the party.  Come to find out, he was going to kill her, only for her and her friends to become a werewolves and they devour the screwy guy.

Last story (last comic transition).  We meet up with the old guy neighbor from the first story now.  He hates Halloween witha passion and hates kids even more.  So then we meet up with this spooky little ""kid"" we've seen throughout the entire film (didn't mention him until now, since his significance wasn't anything but a weird bystander until now, not counting the opening where he kills a woman for blowing out a Jack-o-lantern).  He knocks on the old man's door and asks for candy.  The man refuses and closes the door in the ""kid's"" face.  Then ""hell"" breaks loose as the ""kid"" breaks into the man's house and torments him, before finally he unwittingly gives the weird little ""kid"" who turns out to be some screwy alien/demon thing, who then leaves and thanks the man for the candy.  The final comic piece shows that the old man was actually the bus driver of the mentally challenged children.

Roll credits.

[/SPOILERS]

Acting was bad, the plot was predictable, no character was likable in the least and the final story was pretty much a remake of a Tales from the Darkside episode, or should I say a blatant ripoff?  Doesn't matter.  This movie is nothing more than a gore fetishist's fantasy that lacked any substance or structure.  I'd suggest Creepshow 1 and 2, Body bags, Trilogy of Terror and/or cat's Eye for fun, silly and pretty creepy anthology horror flicks.

But if you want to see this movie so bad, then BORROW it.  Do not buy it from the store, don't buy it from a rummage sale and don't rent it.  Do not give money to this movie at all.

Of course, these are my opinions on this film.  You can form your own by seeing it yourself.",1441411200,5,3738,4.455081001472754

Summary:

It's Halloween night in a little town and everyone is into it. Unbeknownst to them, a little ""demon"" is loose and his name is Sam. He masquerades as a trick-or-treater and so, goes mostly unseen. It opens with a couple returning home from the Halloween festivities downtown and the wife is pretty tired of the holiday. This story soon transitions into another tale taking place in the same town- a murderous school principal is showing his distaste for trick-or-treaters. This story leads into one featuring some school kids, out on Halloween, who are trying to play a prank on a young girl named Rhonda (myself being high-functioning autistic, I really thing Rhonda is one, too). Another story features out murderous principal again, but this time, he encounters werewolves. The final story (or not?) is where our little Sam ""haunts"" the house of a very grouchy old man.

Note: Sam only attacks those who break his rules on Halloween.

Pros: (Some light spoiler may be hidden here, but I will list it last) :

1. Great effects

2. Interesting story-telling

3. VERY interesting killer

4. Leaves room for hardcore fans to have fun filling in small blanks (they're not even noticeable IF you're not a hardcore fan)

LASTLY! (5.) Rhonda gets to have her revenge, even if it's not a very pretty one

Cons:

1. Some may disagree with having a ""cute"" killer and think that that ruins things

2. Some may think it should be unnecessary to have to watch twice to understand the whole story

3. Has a somewhat campy feel (If you don't like campy at all, don't watch)

My thoughts:

Ultimately my favorite horror movie. Although, as I said before when referring to Rhonda, I am an autist. This means I can be highly obsessive over things most people wouldn't even blink at. This is one of my favorite movies for a reason- I have an obsession with Halloween. (EXTREMELY SMALL SPOILER WARNING!) In one scene, one of the children says to Rhonda, ""Boy, you must really love Halloween."". Rhonda replies to him with something like, ""You mean, Samhain?"". He asks, ""What?"". So she responds with ""Samhain, also known as All Hallow's Eve, also known as Halloween. Pre-dating Christianity, the Celtic holiday was celebrated on the one night between autumn and winter when the barrier between the living and the dead was thinnest and often involved rituals that included human sacrifice."" (END OF SMALL SPOILER) In this scene, I tend to get worked up, but I know it's just me. I have a large database of knowledge about Halloween that most people don't have access to (I can name over 16 different books I own on the subject if needed). I just want to clarify, for the few that may care, that the information about Halloween presented by Rhonda in this movie has not all been proven to be true. Mostly the bit about human sacrifice being a ritual involved and the part about lumping with belief in the dead spirits with the Celts. I will repeat, I know that most won't care about this, so this is more of a heads-up for anyone else out there who is into these kinds of details.

But overall, this is an amazing movie and I hear tell that a sequel is in the works. A photo from the production of the sequel was released, showing Sam without his mask and instead of his usual childlike outfit, he was wearing long, flowing, pitch black magic robes. I neglected to mention something the movie never points out to the viewers- Sam is not just any little monster. In case you haven't guessed it from the original name of Halloween, ""Samhain"" and the fact his name is Sam, Sam is actually the force behind the holiday. In other words, he IS the holiday. This is why he attacks when his rules are broken. You hurt him, he hurts back. He goes with ""an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"".

Final words? Most unique, cute little monster I've ever seen in a horror movie. Really neat way of telling the stories, too. Do not skip it over if you like horror films (unless campy stuff bugs you to the extreme).",1429920000,6,4039,4.5875

The movie is broken into 4 stories that all intertwine. Each story has it's own twist and they all involve horror, 2 of which do involve 12-15 year olds children.  I am a father of 2 and it didn't bother me, but for some they may not want to see kids hurt. To be true though, the fact that they did use actual kids and not a bunch of mid 20's acting like high schoolers, is what makes it different and fresh.

It takes 4 different stories and manages to weave them all together.  Well 5 if you count that quick little story at the beginning about the couple coming home from the party/parade.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

It starts with a weird guy who is a closet serial killer who is killing people and burying them in his backyard and carving up their heads like pumpkins with his weird kid.  Then we have a group of sisters who are all dressed like fairy tale characters and going to a party and helping their youngest sister with her, ""first time.""  It turns out they are all werewolves and are talking about her first kill, and her kill happens to be the creepy serial killer guy, awesome poetic justice!

Then we have an awesome story about some kids playing a trick on an awkward classmate and they end up getting eaten by child zombies as she leaves them there to die.  I loved the costumes in this story and also the way she got her revenge was terrific!  The last story in the movie is about an old man who seems to hate kids and enjoys scaring them.  He gets his when the creepy little pumpkin headed boy who has been popping up throughout the movie shows up and terrorizes him.  The costume of this kid was terrific, and the way he looked under the mask was amazing!

The movie ends with a slight flashback to earlier in the night and has all the characters walking/driving past one another as they are blissfully ignorant of what is about to happen to them or each other.

And what I loved most about this movie was that we had Anna Paquin in it!  I loved how she did Rogue in the X-Men movies and she did a pretty good job here too!

3908005,5,B002CYIR34,"Best Halloween movie since Halloween.

Has an all star cast and is in the format of like 4 intertwining story lines occurring in the same town/area on Halloween night.  It has plenty of mystery and one of my favorite things about the movie is that you find wonderful hidden gems that are very cool parts of the story every additional time you watch it.  So this is definitely a movie where 4-5 viewings later you can still find something new and intriguing that you missed during previous viewings or did not know to look out for (i.e. the bus driver's ring).

This is also a great horror movie in general.  I like the Creepshow vibe of multiple stories with stories intertwined and all centered around Halloween.  Trick 'r Treat is a lot less campy than Creepshow and and has some real grit to it making it a true original film that pays homage to a number of horror and Halloween history.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :)

I ended up watching it and i gotta say this wasn't nearly as good as everyone says it is, it jumps around a-lot in the story and is just really inconsistent, it isn't one i would necessarily say to add to your collection.

There are really no scares in it, nothing makes you jump at all. It is a story that seems like some one with ADHD is in control of the story, you jump from scenes to scenes from different people in the movie and all lead back to the same point.

Definitely one you can live without seeing let alone owning.",1415577600,,609,4.109243697478991

As a big fan of horror anthology, the idea of four intertwining stories on Halloween night all in the same small charming Ohio town appealed to me. It is the perfect film that encompasses the very essence of Halloween. It captures the very nostalgia of that giddy feeling you got as a kid on Halloween night each year. Ever since I first watched it those 5 years ago, it has been my personal tradition to watch Trick 'r Treat every Halloween night.",1415404800,,570,4.490384615384615
3908051,5,B002CYIR34,"One of the very best Halloween Movies. Overlooked by the movie industry and general public, like RZ Halloween. This has all the formulas, creativity and love for a true cult classic. The cinematography is beautiful. And you can now see the influence at Disney. That is not Jack and Sally pumpkins all over the landscape for Halloween Week. They did not come from Tim Burton. They came from this movie and the true dark side of Halloween. The movie Trick R Treat was never intended for children, but children are the major stars in this film. Even Sam is a kid. But the candles in the pumpkins, and carved jack-o-lanterns, being place in the yards, sidewalks, paths  and walkways are just too beautiful to ignore. Warner Brothers Shelved this movie in 2007. Persons that purchased the ""300"" DVD's watched Trailers for this movie, but it never played at the Theaters. It was scheduled to be released before Halloween. Perhaps The School Bus Massacre was too much? How crazy is that? It currently is not even listed on Bad Hat Harry Productions. Warner Brothers is now selling thousands of these units. Be a true fan and buy the Blu-ray or DVD. There is very seldom a Halloween Classic. When there is..., the fans are the ones to decide.",1415318400,2,1234,4.686635944700461

3908053,4,B002CYIR34,"I'm thinking that the best way to describe Trick 'r Treat is that it's a quirky horror film comprised of interconnecting stories all centered on the night of Halloween in this one town, which is well know for really getting into the spirit of Halloween. There is not much character development here, but the stories are rather entertaining and they move at a good pace. It was cool how comic book images appeared for each of the stories and how they were focused on the 4 rules of Halloween. While I love werewolves, zombies, quasi vampires, and serial killers as much as any other horror buff, let's face it - They are all very typical in the Hollaween/horror genre. That's why I really appreciated is the originality of the chocolate-loving character Sam (as in Samhaim) who I guess you could describe as a spiritual entity of sorts that keeps popping up throughout the film to enforce the tradition of this beloved Holiday. You see aside from the blood, guts, and gory surprises, there really is a moral to this film - 1) Always remember to wear a costume, 2) Always remember to check out your candy, 3) Always remember to pass out treats (FYI: all the floss you've collected from the dentist doesn't count), & 4) Never blow out a Jack 'O Lantern on Halloween. No clue what I'm talking about? That's fine.  Check out Trick 'r Treat! I don't think you'll be disappointed ^^",1415232000,2,1375,4.612244897959184

3908066,5,B002CYIR34,"It was just by pure luck that I happened across this film.  And that is a shame, because that means it's relatively obscure.  And this movie is waay too clever/creepy/funny/disturbing/well-written/unique/pretty (yes, pretty) to be obscure.

Michael Dougherty (I've never knowingly encountered his name before) serves as both the writer and director, and what a talent he is.  I wil definitely be aware of his work in the future.

When I initially viewed this movie, I thought it was just another B horror movie.  A friend of mine said that he enjoyed it, and I assumed by that he meant it was decently scary.  Being a horror movie fan, I watched it, hoping for a few jumps and a bit of gore, just enough to pass the time.  But this movie was not a horror movie.  It is a mirror and a love letter to Halloween as we know it in 21st-century America...with a definite horrific/darkly comedic slant.

First of all, the film is beautifully shot.  It takes place in a midwestern town with deep autumn in its glory.  The naked, skeletal trees, the leave-strewn ground, the frosty air, the costumed festivity, the wind whipping the golden leaves about...gorgeous. Hollywood A-grade.

Then we have the story.  The director/writer has chosen as his story-telling method the ""Creepshow/Tales from the Crypt"" avenue, that is, an anthology of several stories.  They are also done uniquely, non-linear and intertwined.  And it works beautifully.  Pretty much every Halloween myth, urban legend and real-life experience is tackled here:  poison candy, Halloween massacres, cruel emotionally scarring preteen pranks,hard-partying  vamps in sexy costumes,  harder-partying middle-aged adults in even scantier costumes, and...the original, primitive, all-powerful use behind Halloween's eternal (and presently watered down) symbol, the jack-o-lantern.

The film is such an entertaining mixture of horror (there are some genuinely creepy, gory and horrific moments) and comedy (witty, sharp dialog all around; and never before have I heard Charlie Brown referred to as an @$$hole, HA!!) with a generous dash of sex appeal (love those Disney princesses!).  Dylan Baker, an actor of whose name I've never heard of, was incredibly sinister/campy/geeky/hilarious in his twisted portrayal of Principal Wilkins.  I hope I see more of him in movies to come.  In this film, we have monsters and ghosts and costumed temptresses and blood and chocolate vomit and severed body parts and evil little trick-or-treaters....It's just soo much fun!

If you like the macabre, you like to laugh (even if it's at very dark horror-humor), and - most importantly - you love Halloween (and candy!  WHO doesn't love candy??), you've got to check this one out. (Did I mention it also has Anna Paquin...AKA Sookie of ""True Blood""?  :-) ) I hope in another 10-20 years, it'll be the ""A Christmas Story"" of Halloween.  In my opinion, it deserves no less.",1414972800,5,2908,5.155982905982906

They involve a nerdy principal who moonlights as a serial killer, a school bus
legend involving a group of kids, a young, female virgin searching for the
perfect guy and a mean, old man who gets a mysterious visitor. This is
a pretty good Halloween/horror flick with a decent cast that follows in

It's just a fun romp in the spirit of Halloween.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's got some good twists and turns, some fun dialogue, and just the right amount of creepiness.  Not too heavy (The Shining) and not too light (Beetlejuice....which, BTW, I think is a really bad movie).  The pace is right and the story telling is done well.  It's just a few simple stories that intertwine non-linearly.

And it has a message- ya better respect and honor Halloween.",1412985600,,694,4.4015748031496065

It seems that a bus load of special needs children board a bus.  Looking forward to Halloween . They have their little costumes on....right away you can tell the children aren't right; sitting in their seats, emotionless, unmoving, and eerily silent...that is until the bus takes  a nose dive off a cliff. The old quarry pit. hundreds of feet deep;  the deep black water is even deeper. Not one child so much as makes a peep as they fall killing them all. Except the bus driver. He isn't a bad guy, he just likes a wee nip of the old bottle now and then. .After the crash he is not charged; they never found out about his impairment. It was written up as just a horrible accident.

He should have just fessed  up. Because now, on this particular Halloween, payback is in order. The angry ghosts and their evil  leader (little pumpkin head, ) don't want a treat. They just want to punish the driver that got off Scott free...dnd.every last person that helped him ""sweep the crime under a rug

A jock, along with all his alpha posey make it rough on the nerdy (but cute) boy  that has won the heart of the Jocks X -girlfriend. So the jock dares  them all to go to the haunted quarry, and the alpha crowd begins to make the night a misery for the ""uncool""  kids...that is until the ghost of the bus crash break bad. The jocks are first to suffer their wrath. They come out of the quarry looking for vengeance. They want the old drunk to pay for his negligence. And also wanting to kill along the way, especially  the ones that helped sweep it all away.

3908146,5,B002CYIR34,"-This review will be divided into parts, addressing each story. It need not be said that the interweaving of the stories is perfection. Oh wait. I just did. I will also try my best not to give away spoilers.-

Opening: Was the jump-scare buildup really necessary? No. But the opening did just what a good opening/introduction should do. Set the tone, give a subtle hint to the plot, and not give away the entire story.
The Principal: This was terrifying. The thought that the a principal could go home and secretly be a killer is frighteningly a little too realistic. And the references to the stories to follow was subtle enough to make you wonder and make you intrigued without giving away plot details.
The School Bus Massacre Revisited: This was just plain sad and again, frighteningly realistic. The main concept of scaring the weird kid and the weird kid getting revenge is a bit overused, but it works. And the offscreen kills? Unseen scares are hard to pull off, but they did a decent job.
Surprise Party: I can honestly say I did not expect the twist. Now, I can't say much without revealing the plot, but they did a good job of keeping the audience guessing as the story went on until they revealed the main point/climax of the story. Also, I will point one thing out that I actually didn't find out until I watched the movie 5+ times and visited Wikipedia. The vampire is the principal. Oh, and Anna Paquin? I am biased as a fan of True Blood, but she did a marvelous job, and her role is rather amusing considering her role in True Blood.
Sam: This story was pointless except for tying up loose ends in the school bus story. They really could of done this differently. And Sam? Nightmare fuel and I still have no idea what his role was other than showing up in every story and killing people.
Conclusion: Loose ends are tied up fashionably, and the story is ended somewhat nicely, revealing that much of these stories, if not all, were happening at essentially the same time.",1406505600,,1987,4.550279329608938

3908173,5,B002CYIR34,"""Trick 'r Treat"" is a great little Halloween movie, kind of like a ""Pulp Fiction""-lite for horror fans. ""Trick 'r Treat"" is an anthology film, about living and dying by the rules of Halloween. Let you Jack-O-Lantern's burn out by themselves, don't turn away kids trick or treating, don't take down your decorations before the holiday is over....or you'll pay a price. Each story is interwoven, and it's so much fun to see how they intersect with each other.

Anna Paquin makes an appearance in one of the tales, and she's probably the biggest name here, along with Bryan Cox (who steals the film), but it's the creepy mysterious figure of Sam who is the lead character of the movie. Present in all of the stories here, the burlap headed guardian of Halloween is a creepy presence, and when he shows up, you know blood will spill.

I think what I like best about ""Trick 'r Treat"" is that it captures the mood of Halloween perfectly, from the falling leaves, to the pathways lit with jack-o-lanterns, to the fun costumes, and the goosebumps that you get on the creepiest night of the year. Lot's of fun, with just enough boobs and blood to keep even hardened horror fans entertained, I high recommend you add this to your playlist every autumn.",1399248000,,1242,4.640909090909091

It was entertaining for what it is but by no means is this a great movie.

3908203,5,B002CYIR34,"While it may not be the next super awesome slasher film, this little gem is just amazing. The fact that they are making a sequel to this is also amazing, so long as they don't screw it up, but thats for another review at another time.
This movie is like the ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" show I watched growing up. It has 4 stories that intertwine with one another and a cute little guy named ""Sam"" who you will just have to watch and see for yourself why he is so damn cool.
Sorry, I will not post any spoilers here. I am a horror movie fanatic and I feel that once the plot or ending is revealed for a horror film, it kills any suspense you may have while watching.
All in all, if you like, love or even hate horror movies, this is for you! You will laugh your ass off and s*** your pants all in the same film. BUY IT! Then buy another copy and give it to someone you know, or don't know, it doesn't matter!",1390262400,6,908,3.9672131147540983

The film is composed of interwoven vignettes that move across each other so that each one is actually part of another, but from a different perspective and angle, meaning that some scenes you're watching currently you will recognize as being seen in the background, from behind, while watching another foreground scene.  The bad guys aren't who you think they are, the good guys have issues, and very little is what it seems.  Excellent movie.",1389830400,,609,4.893203883495145

This movie has many classic horror monsters, which is refreshing to see in todays movies which mainly consist of only zombies.

3908220,4,B002CYIR34,Every year I watch this movie. Its scary for different reasons. Urban legends and basic fears tied together to make this a movie that never gets old. Ever watch a movie where you think you feel the cut of the knife instead of the character? Love it!,1386720000,,249,4.319148936170213
3908221,5,B002CYIR34,Love this movie. I cannot get enough of Sam.  I still can't believe this movie went straight to DVD such a shame and a crime this would have done great in theaters and would have been awesome to see this on the big screen so glad I found this little gem.  And I cannot wait for Trick R' Treat 2!,1386633600,2,295,3.9

3908227,5,B002CYIR34,"This is a highly underrated film that is finally starting to get the recognition it deserves. This is the perfect movie to watch during the Halloween season and really gets the vibe and mood of Halloween down insanely well. Everything from the music, to the design of the characters is just total ""Halloween"" in mood and feeling. It features a series of interlocking stories that all tie together.
It's a rare modern horror film that doesn't feature torture porn or people cutting off their own limbs or being hacked violently to pieces for shock value alone and it doesn't feature ridiculous ""Found Footage"" where the characters conveniently film every unspeakable, horrifying act that happens to them from every angle possible. This is an old school, FUN, throwback to what horror films used to be in the 80's. It's in the vein of Creepshow, Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt with a little Pulp Fiction mixed in for good measure.
Highly recommended for anyone interested in a classic horror film that has a fun, entertaining story, insanely cool visuals, great twists and a serious Halloween vibe. This film is to Halloween what A Christmas Story, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Scrooged are to Christmas Holiday viewing.",1385510400,,1249,5.009615384615385

Halloween has an even shorter list. Sure there are plenty of horror classics, but few specific to the holiday itself. Trick 'r Treat has taken the number one spot on my list of Halloween classics. Sorry John Carpenter and Tim Burton, you're still on the list but get bumped down a notch.

Trick 'r Treat is an anthology of stories intertwined with eachother taking place on the same night. Don't let the chronology of events throw you while watching for the first time. The movie covers all the great themes of the holiday and does it with quality.",1383696000,,741,4.78125

I read the ratings and reviews other people had posted, and while I saw a lot of five-star reviews, I also saw some one-star ones. I watched it on Halloween just to see what it was like, expecting it to be nothing more than another one of those Halloween slasher movies. Turns out, I was  completely wrong. And I have never been so satisfied being wrong. Some people are saying it's a compilation of different stories, like Creepshow, but really it's more like the same story told from different points of view and thus showing the same night from many different vantage points in different areas of town. I  can see the similarities to Creepshow, though. But the stories in this movie are connected. The movie centers on a town where the traditions of Halloween are taken very seriously--and for good reason. If you don't follow the traditions to a t, your night will take a turn for the worse.",1383350400,,948,4.538011695906433

2) Somewhat unexpected gore, i.e. a lollipop for a weapon? who would have ever thought that sweets could really kill you? 3) A little gratuitous nudity, it hasn't ever hurt anyone..., 4) Some good suspenseful scenes, and 5) Four interwoven stories.

3908270,5,B002CYIR34,"77 minutes of impressively nuanced Halloween pseudo-anthology goodness with diverse effects and expertly interwoven stories.  This movie blows away expectations.

This fun little Halloween romp includes several interwoven stories.  Unlike most anthologies, all of the stories herein share the same writer and director (Michael Dougherty; only feature film as director).  So, also unlike most anthologies, there is a more consistent level of quality as we move from one short story to the next and there is no obvious beginning or end to each segment--instead they all overlap one another quite well.  Like in Creepshow, comic-book text boxes flag-post story shifts as light comedy and some downright silliness shine through to keep us smiling.  After all, who said Halloween couldn't be both gory and light-hearted?  Mixed among the stories is a nice variety: vampires, werewolves, zombies, serial killers and midget monsters.

Here is a brief summary of the stories:

1.  Four girls in cleavage-rich fairy tale costumes go out on Halloween night seeking manly fare.  The girls are played by Anna Paquin (True Blood, Scream 4, Darkness), Rochelle Aytes, Moneca Delain (Lost Boys: The Tribe) and Lauren Lee Smith (Pathology).  Paquin plays the shy virgin among a pack of experienced man-eaters.

2.  A bus driver attempts to kill a bus full of mentally disturbed children and sort of succeeds.  This event (which is told as a scary story) is linked to a mean prank that some kids pull.  The kids include Britt McKillip (Mission to Mars) and Jean-Luc Bilodeau (Piranha 3DD).

3+.  The overarching intro-to-closing story observes trick-or-treating and trick-or-treaters or all ages in a pleasant neighborhood.  Pleasant, that is, until people start dying at the hands of a strange diminutive murderer and a kid-killing school principal.  This ""story"" features really more than one story of its own and the cast features Leslie Bibb (Hell Baby, 7500), Dylan Baker (The Cell, Fido) and Brian Cox (Zodiac, The Ring).

While not ""maturely"" or seriously presented, the writing felt sound, credible and free of any flaws that would provoke criticism.  Great, in fact, for this kind of movie.  A finer detail in this film is the effective use of jack-o-lanterns as a symbol of death.  Pay attention to what happens after someone blows a jack-o-lantern's candle out.  Also note that the bus driver and the principal each find themselves in more than one story.  Also pay attention as a murderer's child dresses as the murder, complete with a blood-stained shirt after murdering someone earlier in the film!  Now that is META!

A fine job was done with the special effects.  There's no CGI (that I can tell) and every nuance worth showing got plenty of skillful attention.  The gore includes geyser-like vomiting, bloody bodies, severed heads, rubber guts, broken legs with exposed bones, stacks of corpses and a breasty flesh-stripping transformation scene.  I really dug the artistic license taken on the werewolf transformation scene!  It may seem a little dumb to horror fans at first glance, but it was done VERY well and it mingled fantastically with the ""girls in slutty costumes"" theme; they literally ""stripped"" off their human skin to reveal the wolf within.  Given the tone of the movie and the scene, it felt perfect.

It saddens me that Michael Dougherty (the man behind this tactful movie) hasn't done anything in years.  I'd like to think he's working on his next horror masterpiece.  But I fear he's fallen into obscurity.

This is far more worthy than any anthologies of the last 20 years in terms of overall quality.  So take the time this Halloween to enjoy this light-hearted masterpiece.",1382832000,,3696,5.118729096989966

Then the next year Trick or Treat III and so on ... each with different well known actors and great new stories in different towns with the same character of Sam being the focal point of each story like the first one! Geez! I just don't get why the cheesy movies always have series and parts II and III and on and on but movies like this that are the best always stop with the first one!!!!! Uggggg!!!!

My favorite story and scenes in the movie are the ones with the kids going to the Rock Quarry and the story about the bus driver and handicapped kids. They were THE BEST of the whole movie. Wish the whole movie had been based on just this one story with the kids and bus driver and forget about the others with the first young couple, the Principal and his son, the bus driver in his home with his dog at an older age and last the vampire girls. Those were dumb stories. I can see incorporating the old bus driver and his dog in his home with Sam with the kids in the Rock Quarry but that's it. Nothing more. They ruined a lot of the movie I thought with the other stories.

3908294,5,B002CYIR34,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I saw it in the bargain bin at Best Buy a couple of years ago, and bought it for $5.99.  I'm very glad I did, because this is not only the best horror film I've seen, but a pretty damn good movie in its own right, good enough to watch any time of year.  Which is why I'm so confused that this film has been all but disowned by its studio.  My understanding is that it took two years for the thing to be released on home video, and apparently the studio refuses to entertain any possibility of sequels.  Such a pity!  I would think they'd jump at the chance to make money.  But enough rambling.  (EDIT, Nov. 7, 2013: There is now an official ""Trick 'r Treat 2"" in the works!  Go to the Wikipedia page for the movie, then click on footnote #19 to access the article.)

""Trick 'r Treat"" was filmed in the same vein as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow-Blu-ray/dp/B0021L9MJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow [Blu-ray</a>]; several stories connected by a central theme/event.  But as other reviewers have noted, the film also uses the narrative structure of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQT0Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction [Blu-ray</a>], with the story jumping between vignettes throughout.  I won't go into detail so as not to spoil the movie.  The only real quibble I have is that the man who plays the principal overacts while immersed in his alter-ego.  But I want to stress that this does not detract from what is an excellent film.  The A/V quality of this 16x9 widescreen transfer is among the best I've seen on Blu-ray.  ""Trick 'r Treat"" is also one of the very few releases whose special features are, in my opinion, worth watching.  I recommend viewing it several times, including at least once while listening to the director's commentary; this will allow you to appreciate all the little nuances Michael Dougherty & Team threw into the mix.  From the editing to the choice of music, nothing was left to chance, and I commend the entire crew for their work.

This is one of four movies I watch every Halloween, the other three being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bram-Stoker-s-Dracula-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGJ7ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bram Stoker's Dracula [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepy-Hollow-Blu-ray/dp/B00AEBB9V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepy Hollow [Blu-ray</a>], and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orgy-of-the-Dead/dp/B000228EFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orgy of the Dead</a>.  I prefer to watch this one first, and I advise viewing the ""History of Halloween"" special on the disc before the actual film.  For you hard core fans, there have been several merchandise tie-ins made since the film's release.  These include a ""making of"" book, a graphic novel adaptation, action figures, and at least one Halloween mask.  The last time I checked, all these were still available on Amazon.  I'm not sure if the soundtrack is available for purchase, but if it is, I'll definitely buy it.

Top marks from me.  Do yourself a favor and buy this gem.",1380240000,,3308,5.897058823529412

We rented it and I fell in love with it. That night I didn't even know it was out on dvd already.

3908351,5,B002CYIR34,"Michael Dougherty makes an incredible directorial debut with TRICK 'R TREAT, a stylish and mean-spirited Halloween anthology that is sure to become a yearly tradition for Horror fans! It is a dark Halloween Night, and the streets are alive with ghouls and ghosts! The school's principal teaches his kids the real meaning of Halloween, and why it is always important to check your candy... A beautiful young co-ed sets off to find a date for her sorority party, but both of them are in for a terrible surprise... Four kids decide to play a mean trick on one of the neighbors at a haunted rock quarry, but the ghosts that reside there don't find it to be very funny... A crotchety old man is the one who gets tricked when he decides not to offer treats to the wrong child... Dougherty doesn't just use the holiday as a cheap backdrop, but immerses the film in the modern traditions and ancient pagan lore that define it. TRICK 'R TREAT is one of the most beautifully shot Horror films to come out of the past decade, illuminating the screen with rich Autumn hues in deep oranges, reds, blues, and browns that bring out the spirit of the holiday. Creeping mists, candlelight, and creaking floorboards drip with spooky atmosphere, and create a world where vengeful spirits surely exist. Dougherty cleverly intertwines each of the sordid tales into his own twisted timeline which comes together perfectly in the end! Look for Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, and Brian Cox in just a few of the devious roles.

3908357,4,B002CYIR34,"The thing I enjoyed best about this movie was its unique presentation. There are hundreds, if not thousands of traditional Halloween movies that follow a rather cheesy formula. Not that there's anything wrong with that- there is, after all, a comfort to be found in the familiarity of that oft tested formula. However, it's much more rewarding (not to mention refreshing), to watch a Halloween movie that embraces something original, while maintaining many of the traditional elements (werewolves, cranky hermits with secrets, etc.).

The unique approach that I speak of is the decision to tell several ""short stories"" in the film, rather than one continuous arc. While each of these are quite enjoyable on their own (though the first one is uncharacteristically morbid for the collection, and I wish its placement had been altered), the true payoff comes as the movie progresses. It is then, as the collection of stories wraps up, that we find they WERE connected all along, and part of a bigger story. Generally funny and well produced, this is a great Halloween movie with something different to bring to the table.",1357344000,,1118,5.043243243243243
3908358,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick R' Treat is absolutely one of the best horror films that has been released since the year 2000. Released in 2009, this film was was briefly marketed in 2007 but then abruptly shelved by Warner Brothers. This movie is basically a well done tribute to eighties anthology horror films, such as CREEPSHOW. What makes this film so much fun is that it is so moody and the stories are very well told. The film does have it's disturbing moments, but the humor contained within the film tends to balance it all out. We have stories that all take place on Halloween and feature demons, zombies, werewolves, vampires and a little vignette about an elementary school principal.

The film is inspired by and loosely draws from a particularly good Halloween themed animated short film called Halloween: Season's Greetings. The moodiness and the clever humor of this film make it far better than any one of the hundreds of boring gore fests that are released these days.

3908379,5,B002CYIR34,"Years haven't been the kindest on the horror genre, but Trick R Treat is a pure, well crafted, genius, masterpiece of our generation! It takes on a Creepshow like approach except each story is connected to each other. In this contains a School Principal with a murderous secret, 5 teens who are paying there respects to a group of 8 children who were killed on a school bus that fell into the rock quarry, a 22 year old girl who's stalked by a rather vicious admirer, and a old hermit who will be paid a visit by the icon of this movie Sam (he's on the cover.)
This is a perfect mix of Comedy and Horror. The comedy is not done in idiotic ways that spoil the movie for one. And though there is blood and gore, the film doesn't rely on it to create it's scares. In fact the scariest death is actually off screened but is heard. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see the movie as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Along with the scares and comedy, there are quite a few surprising twists in the movie that I sure didn't see coming. But like I said, I'm not going to ruin it for anyone!
It's a shame that this wasn't originally sent to the theater. I can't get over how wonderful Trick R Treat is. It really keeps the spirit of Halloween alive. From this point forward, watching this each Halloween night will be my tradition.

3908383,5,B002CYIR34,"Several years ago I came across the trailer for this feature, as did many others. Its imdb entry had a that-year Halloween release, which as October came and went, this date evaporated fromt he entry; it turned out empty suits deemed that ""children in peril"" was ""too scary,"" despite numerous films to date (and since) proving otherwise, let alone some of such examples having had children DIE.
Years later it popped up to be the premier opener for Los Angeles Screamfest and I immediately got two tickets for my friend and myself; understandably the place was packed with people who had *also* been forced by Warner Bros to wait to see this highly entertaining feature, in flavour along the lines of ""Creepshow"" and ""HBO's Tales from the Crypt"" such.
Little [Sideshow] Sam is THE new icon for Halloween, as he wanders in and out of the multiple and the four stories, well-woven in semi-non-linear time. Writer/director Michael Dougherty created Sam for ""Seasons Greetings,""  animated short that he hand-drew. The DVD short-changes by not containing an audio commentary (though there is one for ""Seasons Greetings,"" which is included as a Bonus Feature); the now-affordable Blu-Ray version does contain audio commentary on the feature, though apparently no actual Top Menu; the film kicks right in after the preview stuff, and the Menu button brings up the Bonus Features menu.

I'm only not giving it a one, 'cause I've seen worst. It's a bunch of shorts revloving around the same neighborhood. The first one, Leslie Bibb is in it, and they try to pull a 'Scream' where they off the biggest star in the film in the first few minutes. Except, Drew Barrymore is a big star, and Leslie Bibb, not so much, so the impact falls flat, not to mention, we've already seen this trick before. Not to mention, the way they did it was not scary, did not make sense, and was just downright lame. This film wasn't scary, it wasn't original, it wasn't well written or directed, it really left you wondering why or how this film even got made. I really felt like it was some bad TV pitch for a series, that didn't get bought and so they tried to fund a film, to do something with their god awful project.

3908388,4,B002CYIR34,"It doesn't pay to be stingy on Halloween.  Always respect the tradition, celebrate it, and be generous.  If not, our pumpkin-headed friend just might pay you a visit.  And he's not the kind of treater you want knocking at your door.  Most people do not survive the experience.

The setting is a small town, during Halloween.  It seems some of the residents just have forgotten,  or just do not care, to celebrate Halloween.  A mild-mannered school principal who kills people, a virgin with a boyfriend, a grumpy old man who refuses to give candy, and a house wife who just is not into the spirit of halloween will all have to account for themselves when the pumpkin head pays them a visit.  Pumpkin Head has issues with people who do not respect and who do not celebrate Halloween.  And he ain't the forgivin' type, if you know what I mean.  Slackers beware!

Anyway, I want to keep this review short.  You shouldn't be wasting time right now reading reviews.  Here's what you should do.  You've got time to run to the grocery store and buy some candy.  Don't forget to get a costume on the way back.  Rent this movie and download it to your device, pop some corn, put on your costume, and get into the spirit of Halloween.  And above all, be generous to the children when they come knocking at your door.  Do all of the above, and you just might enjoy the night.

This is a really good movie.  The perfect movie to rent for tonight.

Happy Halloween, my friends.",1351641600,,1463,4.462121212121212
3908389,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick 'r Treat is an anthology horror film of four different Halloween related stories threaded together and told out of chronological order. In the small and pleasant town of Warren Valley, Ohio, a young married couple walks home late on Halloween night. The wife, Emma (Leslie Bibb), is less enthusiastic about Halloween and its traditions than her husband, Henry (Tahmoh Penikett). In fact, she breaks the tradition of leaving jack-o'-lanterns on all night for Halloween to ward off evil. As she starts to remove some decorations and debris from her front yard, she has a bad feeling that someone is watching her.

The next story takes place a bit earlier in the evening. It follows a ne'er-do-well child named Charlie (Brett Kelly) who likes to smash pumpkins and steal candy on Halloween. He winds up at the house that belongs to his judgmental principal Mr. Wilkins (Dylan Baker) who gives Charlie a lecture and slowly reveals his secret lifestyle. Meanwhile, Wilkins' very young son dresses up and plays around the house oblivious to his father's true nature.

The next story occurs even earlier in the night. A young mean girl named Macy (Britt McKillip) is collecting jack o lanterns with her friends and lackeys Schrader (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), Sara (Isabelle Deluce) and Chip (Alberto Ghisi). They take these gourds to the house of a charming but awkward idiot savant named Rhonda (Samm Todd) and the group goes to a local rock quarry. Macy tells the group of a local urban legend about the rock quarry's history and she teams with her friends to pull a cruel prank on Rhonda. This prank goes awry as Rhonda and Warren Valley have secrets that Macy did not foresee.

The next story follows a young, reserved and perhaps old-fashion woman named Laurie (Anna Paquin) who is teased about her virginity by her older sister Danielle (Lauren Lee Smith) and their curvaceous friends Maria (Rochelle Aytes) and Janet (Moneca Delain) as they gab and prepare for a costume party. Feeling self-conscious, Laurie splits from the other three as they pick up local joes for dates, and she takes the long road to the party. She soon feels a presence of what may be a stalker and her first time might be imminent but will it be her first time encountering a vampire?

The final story follows an old hermit named Kreeg (Brian Cox) who hates Halloween and deliberate scares away trick-or-treaters without offering any candy. Sam (Quinn Lord), an offended child in a rustic burlap hood and pumpkin orange pajamas, begins attacking this Scrooge of Halloween but this is no ordinary trickster or punk kid. Kreeg ends up fighting for his life against this mysterious foe.

This is one of those rare movies that I can legitimately call awesome. It inspired awe in me that this film captures so well the best of Halloween lore, horror movies and anthology films with a bit of humor and a lot of surprises. Writer and director Michael Dougherty showed not only professional talent in constructing these stories and directing this film but also a strong appreciation of Halloween (and even its Gaelic predecessor Samhain) as well as the traditions and aesthetics of the great horror films. For example, there are some cool allusions to classic movies such as John Carpenter's The Thing and Halloween. The props, make-up, costumes and effects are top-notch and it creates a wonderfully creepy aesthetic that maintains the friendly and festive exterior of a small town with a big Halloween celebration. This film might set the record for the number of jack-o'-lanterns in a single film.

I do not wish to give any of the surprises or secrets of the film away but he does create an instantly iconic character for Halloween. In fact, the stories balance horror and monsters with a good dose of humor and characters that are fleshed out. Given the short run time of the film, my only complaint is that the film could have used a few more scenes (maybe an additional story) but perhaps I am being greedy. Speaking of the stories, this film is nonlinear in the footsteps of Kubrick's The Killing or Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Like those films, there are a lot of little nods and ""Easter eggs"" for repeat viewers throughout the film as well as the protagonists of some stories appearing as extras in other stories. The acting is laudable, for the most part, some of the child actors are less than perfect, but Samm Todd as Rhonda steals the show as the vulnerable but ultimately sharp and courageous teenager. Cox and Baker stand out as well and have a lot of fun in their roles as demented adults who end up in a lot of trouble.

It is shocking and disappointing that a film this well-made, clever and appreciative of the horror genre was shelved for so long and not released in theaters as so much non-scary dreck hits the big screens in the U.S.A. Will they learn their lesson and work with Mr. Dougherty to create a sequel as he hopes to do? Maybe or maybe not, but I think it is safe to say this is a very entertaining film for those seeking some fun and a few creeps and scares. Trick 'r Treat sets a high bar for both horror and anthology films.",1351641600,,5127,4.74103139013453

Pretty much anything John Carpenter does, Alien, Aliens, The Descent, Predator 1&2(Not the AVP crap)Tales from the Crypt and I think The Walking Dead may be the best show on TV.

This ultra-slick, fast-paced, witty, original and funny anthology (with a twist, the stories and wrap-around are interwoven) is the best Halloween-themed film since John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece but in the tradition of King/Romero's CREEPSHOW and TALES FROM THE CRYPT.

3908419,5,B002CYIR34,"Annually, my local Walmart sets out a few horror/Halloween themed movies. It's not even October and this year's Halloween DVDs/Blu-Rays are already out, in which the majority of them are a mixed bag of good and bad treats. I already own all the good ones and a few that I don't are not my style, but I did pick up Trick `r Treat only because Anna Paquin was on the back cover.

Trick 'r Treat was released to one theater in December 2007 followed by a handful of screens in 2008 and 2009, mostly at festivals. The movie was finally released to DVD on October 6, 2009 and received mostly good reviews to the small amount of critics who viewed it.

In this anthology in the style of the Creepshow, a short trick-treater, Sam, wearing a worn-out orange pajamas with a burlap sack over his head, keeps popping throughout the movie. Emma (played by Leslie Bibb) and Henry are the couple that opens up the movie. Henry loves the holiday and has over-decorated their yard with ghost-scarecrows. She demands that he cleans up everything on Halloween night, but he says he'll get to it tomorrow, which she knows he is a lying. He goes inside the house while Emma begins to take down the scarecrows and comes face to face with horror.

Charlie a trick-or-treater stops by Principle Wilkins house and steals a few pieces of Halloween candy that was on the front porch, but he is in for a shock when the candy turns out to be poisoned. It seems that Principle Wilkins drags Charlie's lifeless body inside. Later that night, he digs a hole in the backyard and tosses Charlie on top of another corpse. He is in a hurry to get the bodies covered up, help out his son carve a unique jack-o-lantern, and get ready for his date.

Five pre-teen kids, Macy; Schrader; Sara; Chip; and Rhonda, make their way through town and eventually to the rock quarry. Macy tells the other about the The Halloween School Bus Massacre that took place thirty years ago. It seems that a school bus containing eight mentally challenged children were chained in their seats. Instead of taking them home, the bus driver drives toward the quarry. Let's just say there is an accident and the bus goes over the ravine, killing all the children.

The intent of the night was to scare Rhonda, but the others turn the tables on her and pull a prank that scares Macy almost to death. Suddenly out of nowhere, the eight victims come out of the quarry in a zombie-like-state. The kids try to make it to the elevator, but Rhonda locks the door and rides back up to the top while the others are eaten alive.

Laurie (played by the lovely Anna Paquin) is pestered by her older sister Danielle and her two friends Maria and Janet, into losing her virginity. Wearing her little red riding hood costume, Laurie is on the look out for the right guy to be her first, while her sister and friends drag a couple of guys to a party out in the woods. Laurie has no luck finding the right guy and begins to walk to the party, but someone is following her. At first she thinks it is a vampire, but it turns out to be Principle Wilkins on the prowl for his date. With no other choice, Laurie settles for Wilkins, revealing her true self in a howling way.

An elderly man, Kreeg, hates Halloween with a passion and lives alone in his old house with his dog, Spite. He scares away every trick-or-treater that comes knocking at his door, but tonight there is a surprise for him - Sam! It seems the little guy doesn't like people who disgrace Halloween and he plans on giving Kregg a Halloween that he'll never forget.

I paid only four dollars for the DVD, so I wasn't expecting too much from the movie, especially with its short running time at 82 minutes. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually liked it! A few of the main characters and victims are actually children, which gives this Halloween anthology more of a fright. The pint-size Sam is the new Michael Myers! Don't let his height fool you as he doesn't like anyone messing with his holiday. Sam actually first appeared in the animated 1996 short called Season's Greetings which appears as a special feature on the DVD. Trick r' Treat is now one of my ""must watch"" movies at Halloween! I recommend others to turn off the lights, watch the movie, and enjoy a horrorific Halloween treat!",1348012800,,4293,4.4878361075544175

Hmmm.......this movie reminds me of the first Halloween movie at times, with barking dogs, similar music, a guy standing in the street with a white mask, etc. but you know what? That's okay, because at least this movie depicts sheer terror and horror that has become the Halloween movie genre these days. For the most part, this movie is a straight shooter in terms of plot, anticipated action and suspense. And, as usual, there are deranged and psychotic characters to add to the chaos. I like the atmosphere of this movie. The settings are perfect, and the feel is there for the viewer to take in. I enjoyed this movie for the most part. The werewolf scene with the girl and the guy was over the top and silly, but I guess that most Halloween movies out there have at least one stupid sequence. Sam is an interesting character, and I'd like to see a sequel in the future so we can get to know this figure a little better.

3908421,5,B002CYIR34,"I can not comprehend how this film ended up going straight to DVD.  Does anyone know?  This film is excellent.  The greatest anthology I have ever seen.  Most people are calling this the quintessential movie to watch on Halloween.  It's true.

First of all the mood and locations in this film are absolutely perfect.  It captures the feeling of Halloween night down to the last detail.  Not just Halloween but the spirit of Autumn (My personal favorite season).  Watching this film is just a pleasure, it actually puts me in a good mood.

The stories themselves are quite original and the way they intertwine with one another is just great.  The stories are creepy and manage to keep surprising twists until the very end.  Over all the movie is horror in the classic sense.  What I mean by that is that there is no ""Murder porn"" ""Gritty realism"" or ""Shaky camera"" nonsense here.  This movie is a simple and beautiful horror movie with no dumb director or camera antics.  For the modern audience the chances are extremely high this film will not be scary, especially to a seasoned horror veteran.  However, for the casual fan this movie will do just fine.  As for kids, well this movie is Rated R for a reason so I'd keep the kids away from this one.  Especially during the beginning we get a quick shot of one of the characters watching porn.  Other than that 3 second scene, the rest of the movie remains untainted.

If this movie had been made in the 80s it would be held as one of the most revered classics of it's time.  I am still convinced that this film will become classic.  It's just that good.  There will come a time when this film will be associated with Halloween as the film ""The Grinch"" is associated with Christmas.

The Blu Ray quality and sound are excellent.  Buy this movie, grab some pizza, beer, snacks, and some friends and simply enjoy.  Some 80s films that are similar to this in either style or fun in general are:

Normally, it's the well thought out one star reviews that sway me more so than glowing ones, but after watching Trick r Treat, I am honestly STUNNED there were reviewers who didn't ""get"" it! All right, it may not be the best horror movie in years, but it certainly qualifies as one of the better, more memorable horror flicks I've seen in a good long while.

It certainly was not difficult to understand or complicated in any way, though if you're expecting an over simplified plot that you can just shut your brain off and wait for the blood and guts to go flying or for a scare around every turn, this is definitely going to be a disappointment. This is by no means your typical slasher flick done in the style of Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, etc. - no edge of your seat, nail biting scenes in this one, sorry. Instead, being that those types are not exactly my cup of tea, this chilling, atmospheric film was to me a diamond amongst coals in the slim pickings that is the horror genre. Instead of screams and gore, it has more of a twisted feel to it, with the shivers coming from the dark humour in play throughout, and from the theme of poetic justice which is what really interconnects the stories.

3908429,4,B002CYIR34,"Completed in 2007 and shelved (for no discernable reason) by Warner Bros., this stylish and thoroughly entertaining Halloween anthology from writer-director Michael Dougherty and producer Bryan Singer is a great deal more satisfying than their prior collaboration on ""Superman Returns."" Here Doughtery spins a delightfully ghoulish succession of vignettes all centered around an Ohio town celebrating October 31st, ranging from a girl just wanting to experience her ""first time"" (Anna Paquin) to a school principal (Dylan Baker) who enjoys carving a particular kind of jack o'lantern. The stories are deftly intertwined, the visuals by cinematographer Glen MacPherson and production designer Mark Freeborn are evocative of the season, while composer Douglas Pipes throws a nod to Herrmann with his brooding score. Add in a memorable creature anti-hero that's bound to become a cult favorite and you have the recipe for a jolly good time.

Warner's DVD edition of ""Trick `R Treat"" includes a decent 16:9 (2.35) transfer that pixilates badly during one sequence (where several young trick-or-treaters are in a spooky canyon), but otherwise is well composed. The DVD also houses an active 5.1 soundtrack, a pan-and-scan 1.33 version, and a hand-drawn animated short by Doughtery that proved to be the inspiration for the film. This is included either with or without the director's commentary. The Blu-Ray version (which, alas, the studio did not provide for review) apparently contains more extras than what we have here.

Gory but not needlessly explicit, with some enjoyable old-school moralizing (the film's victims, either juvenile or adult, tend to either be guilty of playing tricks or neglecting the true spirit of Halloween), ""Trick `R Treat"" is a short and sweet, inspired horror ride that comes highly recommended!",1337817600,,1822,5.457446808510638
3908430,4,B002CYIR34,"A lot of people may have heard of this movie around 2009 when its few public screenings got amazing reviews and it was widely regarded as one of the best horror movies of that year, and even some saying in the last 20 years. It had a lot of hype upon its DVD release. Going into this I did not expect the movie to live up to its hype upon viewing it.....I was pleasantly surprised.

Trick r' Treat takes an interesting approach, along the same line as Creepshow and Tales From the Darkside, in that it is not one movie with one story, rather one movie broken up into 4 separate Halloween themed stories that are all connected in some way. We watch each story play out as a strange little boy with a sack over his head watches. This strange sack-boy, named Sam, is present in each story.

This movie is just a surefire hit all around. The stories are all fantastic and well written. I don't think I have any complaints with any one of them. None were very predictable while I was watching and the movies formula of having them all spliced together and occurring at the same time. This is adverse to the creepshow and tales from the darkside approach of playing them one right after the other which feels fresh.

The acting in this movie is really good too. In terms of straight to dvd releases its got to be the best or second best I've ever seen and I have watched so many that's hard for me to say. The acting in this movie tops the acting I've even see in some of the movies I've seen in the theater. I can't pick a particular standout because they are all really good. The movie stars veterans such as Anna Paquin who plays the main character of Surprise party Laurie, and Dylan Baker who plays Steve Wilkes.

I don't want to give anything away so all I can say is, if you are a horror fan, you definitely need to check out this movie & add it to your collection. The reason that I'm only giving this DVD 4 stars is not because of the movie itself but because of the lack of special features. All we get is a short film by the director that inspired the movie which is great don't get me wrong & we get his commentary for the short film but I don't understand why if he could do the commentary for that, why we don't get a commentary track for the film or any other special features.

It now has to share it with Trick R Treat, which is now jockeying for position with NoTD as my favorite horror movie.

Throughout the movie I couldn't help but get excited at how well it was done. I've always thought that the 80s was *the* decade for horror films since it brought so much to the table. (There are some later films that are good, but let's be honest- the 80s brought us films such as the original Friday the 13th & Nightmare on Elm Street.) Trick R Treat is one of the first movies of the last 10-20 years that not only has the feel of the older horror films but also manages to bring a more modern spin to it.

This movie has it all. You've got damsels in distress (sorta), psychotic men who look normal, & ghouls coming from beyond in order to wreak their revenge. The movie has about 3-4 stories that go on throughout the movie, all of which are pretty cleanly done. You can watch the movie without getting too confused as to what's going on. Plus there's the beautiful Anna Paquin in a role that must have been tailor made for her, she fit it so well!

I do recommend that if you're a little squeamish that you exercise a little caution. The violence & gore in this is surprisingly sedate, with almost none of it being directly shown. It's all cleverly done out of sight via camera angles, comic panels, & such. There are deaths in here that you won't see in many other movies though, so I just have to caution you that if you're sensitive so these sort of things you'll probably want to hold off seeing this movie for a while. (I'll elaborate on these deaths in the comments if you're curious.)

All in all, I love this movie. Sure it has a few faults but overall this was just a fun & demented watch.",1305504000,,1970,4.636103151862464
3908442,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick `r Treat has an interesting release date. The film was actually ready to go much earlier than that but never got any real wide releases on the big screen or DVD until 2009. Somehow though it retains a 2008 release so we're going to have to go with that instead of the 2009 one which would make more sense. The film is the creation of Michael Dougherty and he put in his own blood, sweat, and tears to get this film out and everyone who sees it can instantly agree it was worth it. This was his first movie fully directed (aside from the 1996 animated short Season's Greetings which it is based off of) though he did write X-Men 2, Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, and part of Superman Returns prior. Don't let that Superman reference throw you (with how many hated that movie I can see why it may be difficult to do) as Trick `r Treat is a homage to horror and anthology based fully upon Halloween - the only holiday that can be claimed by the horror community and has never had a movie to truly stand behind that celebrates it.

What we see within Trick `r Treat is an entity known as ""Sam"" who is both watching and participating in the Halloween festivals. There are traditions that are followed on Halloween but what we are shown is that many of these traditions are in fact rituals that need to be followed for if they are broken on this night it can mean certain death. The story is told during the course of a single night on Halloween and is being held in a small town that is meant to reflect any number of towns from around the world giving a ""it could happen anywhere"" vibe.

Sam links four stories that occur within the town and each one is more entertaining than the last. I really can't give you a summary in order as multiple of these stories are partially spread out throughout the entire film. We open with a short of Sam being very unhappy with a woman who is anti-Halloween and takes down her decorations a little early. Following this we are told a tale that involves a principal (Dylan Baker) who starts his scene by teaching someone who is not following the ""rules"" of Halloween by giving him a taste of his own medicine and is shown to be teaching his son valuable lessons as well. We are let in to follow a group of young women who are getting ready for a Halloween party and see one of them (Anna Paquin pre-True Blood) being stalked. There are a group of kids who are stealing pumpkins as a way to terrify someone they aren't close friends with but what happens when the urban legend they are using turns out to be partially real? Finally we end with an old man (Brian Cox) who is taught a lesson about both Halloween and not being able to run from his past.

I could honestly write for pages on various reasons on why this film is a must own. Trick `r Treat is the decisive Halloween treat for any Horror fan out there so all I will say is that if you haven't picked this one up you are doing yourself a disservice.",1301788800,,2942,4.278276481149012

This movie is actually a series of four intertwining yet widely varied short stories.  There is a sense of dark humor running through each of the stories, and the villain of one story may get their just desserts as the victim of another story.  On the flip side, the monsters in one story may become the tragic sympathetic victims in another.  The cast is fantastic, the visuals style is great, and the twists come completely unexpected.
If you're looking for a typical blood-drenched slasher movie or a creature feature about a mindless monster on a killing spree, I'd strongly suggest looking elsewhere.  However, if you're looking for something unique, entertaining, and sprinkled liberally with healthy doses of gore and creepy atmosphere, I think this movie would make a wonderful addition to your Halloween traditions.

3908459,5,B002CYIR34,"Writer/Director Michael Doughery's ""Trick 'r Treat"", (2007), is a wonderful, scary anthology of Halloween tales that will make everyone be afraid.

In the tradition of ""Tales from the Crypt""; Stephen King/George A. Romero's ""Creepshow"", (1982); and ""Tales of Terror"", (1976), we have:

~A couple who like Halloween. When the wife sees a ""Michael Myers""-like masked figure on the street, she get frightened, only to meet her death at other hands, as a Jack O' Latern creature watches on;

~In the second story a overweight, candy-loving boy steals candy from Steven, (Dylan Baker), a respected schoolteacher by day; by night, he's a Serial Killer; while Red Riding Hood, Anna Paquin, ""The Piano"", (1993); ""X Men trilogy""; and ""True Blood"" tv show, and her friends go out on the town. When a man pretends to be a 'real' Vampire, he gets more than he bargains for during Halloween, as the Jack O'Latern makes another appearance;
~In the third story, a girl tells her friends a story about a bus driver who makes a pact with parents of their 'distubed' childen to kill them, but when one of the kids, (dressed as Dracula), overtakes the bus, and it plunges into the sea, the driver barely survives. As a girl freaks out when her friends pretend to be the ghosts of the kids, she leaves them to their deaths, as she sees the same Jack O' Latern, while she pulls a trolley down the street;
~The forth story is about a old man, (Brian Cox), ""Manhunter"", (1986); ""The Ring"", (2002); and ""Zodiac"", (2007), who sees Steven in the backyard. As his neighbor, he hates Halloween. When he tries to kill the Jack O' Latern, (who just wants his treats), he gets so scared, that he will do anything to stay alive.

In the end, the story ends like the beginning: The couple talk in the street, she doesn't die; the old man gets a knock on the front door. He gives out candy, then gets another fright, as the Jack O' Latern has finished his work on Halloween for the night.

I give the movie five stars. Highly recommended.

The DVD also has Michael Doughtery's short film ""Seasons Greetings"" (2006) which the Jack O'Latern goes trick and treating on peoples' doors only to be killed by a Halloween hating man.

""Trick 'r Treat"" is R for strong violence and adult themes.",1288483200,,2252,4.657430730478589

Four stories featuring a serial killing principal, a desperate virgin, bullying teenagers, and a lonely old man are linked together by a recurring demonic little character called Sam, apparently a child with a bag over his head. Sounds interesting, but virtually nothing is explained and the existence of all the most imaginative elements is skipped over entirely. It's like the filmmakers had loads of great ideas but absolutely no foundation for them.

Still, it's very slick, highly atmospheric, mildly scary and occasionally funny. A film any horror fan should pick up for cheap.

After watching this movie, I was really dissapointed. I laughed the whole way through the movie! There wasn't any scary part in this film.

On that note, I must say it was a good movie. If your looking to get the crap scared out of you, this is not the movie for you! Although it is an interesting movie, I wouldnt recommend it to someone looking for a thrill!",1287619200,2,531,4.155339805825243

I'm only giving it 4 stars because it had comedy infused with the horror throughout the movie.  It was entertaining, but I thought it would be scarier.  The script writer did an excellent job linking each story.  I'm surprised it went straight to video, it wasn't a bad movie at all.  I opted to order this movie for the opening weekend of a director's new movie which was set in an elevator.  I have been very disappointed with his movies lately and have been waiting for them to go to video instead.  The other reason I didn't go to the new movie is that it was only 1 hour and 20 minutes long.  I enjoy a longer time for a movie and to me the length of the new film was more like a television special.  It was better and cheaper to stay home and watch this movie and a couple of others.",1284940800,,919,4.176136363636363
3908476,4,B002CYIR34,"The first time I had seen any evidence of this film was when I bought ""300"" on DVD. In the trailers before ""300"" there was this interesting segment that plays like a reel-to-reel film I would have seen as a child in Elementary School. It is a smart black and white piece on the ""Dangers of Trick or Treating"". Following that short segment was the additional trailer for ""Trick R' Treat"".

I thought the trailer looked sweet and I def wanted to check out the movie. That was the year 2007 if my memory serves me correctly. I waited and waited to see anything on television, a trailer or anything, about ""Trick R' Treat"". Nothing happened.

Eventually, upon searching about it online, I found out WB scrapped it. Eventually, it was released on DVD 2 years after I had seen that trailer.

After watching it, I cannot see why it never went to theaters. It would not have been a box office smash hit, but compared to so many lame horror films, this is a treat of something different in the genre. I heard people say it didn't make sense or was hard to follow, but that's because they did not pay attention. It reminded me of ""Creepshow"" in how it tells many seperate stories at once.

This is not the typical horror movie that has one masked killer going around slaying people. It blends horror, chills, surprising twists, and comedy very well. I can see this film becoming a classic for horror buffs to sit around and watch every night on Halloween.

I highly recommend a rental considering the reviews have been good and bad. Don't give up on it in 5 minutes! Allow it some time for the story to build.

Thank you for reading!",1284854400,2,1623,4.447811447811448

I waited and waited, and, never hearing anything, did my internet research to find that it was stalled, sitting on a shelf somewhere in the studio, finally to be released direct-to-DVD.

I, like many, read a lot of the hype, and the more I read, the more I really, REALLY wanted to see it.

I was NOT disappointed.

While I know many were disappointed in the film, both for it's format and content, I was delighted: Finally, an original idea, and WHAT an idea! Sure, comic-type anthologies have been done before, but this one took the whole concurrent timeline style and incorporated everything I remember from Hallowe'en as a kid. Each story was brought to me in a creepy and intriguing fashion, and whereas I've seen complaints that the stories were too short and not enough was given, I look at them from the perspective of campfire ghost stories: we never knew the back-story of the guy with the hook that haunted lover's lanes, now did we? We knew the old woman that lived alone in the spooky old house was someone to avoid, but we didn't know her whole history. Trick 'r Treat, like those old tales we heard as kids, gives us as much as we need...and that's plenty.

The characters were believable and well-acted (and with Sam, I do believe that we have a whole new icon for the holiday), the legends, myths, and superstitions of Hallowe'en were blended perfectly into the storylines, and while it wasn't a ""scary"" movie per se, there was a prevailing sense of mystery and fear that ran throughout the night portrayed in the movie's confines...

...and for me, it definitely took me back to that eight-year old boy with the plastic costume and vaccu-formed mask, toddling about to get treats, but having respect, awe, and no small amount of fear of just what might really be milling around in the darkness of All Hallows Eve.

3908485,5,B002CYIR34,"TRICK 'R TREAT contains four interweaving stories taking place on Halloween night in a small town in Ohio.

We get to see friendly school principal Mr Wilkin's secret life as a serial killer, while a group of his students prepare to play a cruel prank on classmate Wanda. Meanwhile virginal Laurie and her man-hungry sorority sisters are visiting town for a party and she decides tonight's THE night and a grouchy old recluse who hates Halloween recieves an unwelcome trick or treater.

I remember reading about a upcoming horror film called TRICK 'R TREAT way back in 2006. It was going to be a similar style to cult classic Creepshow and would recieve a cinematic release in October 2007. Then it's release was pushed back to October 2008.

So I eagerly waited and waited... and eventually forgot all about it, until I happened to come across it last week. So how did it fare under the weight of four years of anticipation?

Wow covers my thoughts nicely. I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film so much; It just ticks all of the boxes for me. The acting is solid, the pace never drags, the visuals are stunning and the balance between tension, gore and comedy is spot on.

The style is a bit similar to Creepshow in that there are four seperate stories at play; But here they are all in motion at the same time, the characters sometimes cross paths and we go back and forth in the timeline by a few hours.

I thought Laurie and her tale stood above the others as that plot thread has the biggest twist. That's not to say that the other threads pale in comparison - they don't. But if you have seen a few horror movies you'll find them a bit predictable. The prankster kids is the weakest link on the predictability score, but it's still fun to watch it all unfold.

One word of warning: I keep calling it a horror film, but it's not really. I'd class it as a dark comedy. There are a few jumpy bits and moderate gore, but if you want a true horror film look elsewhere.

Remember those ghostly tales told on Halloween night that made you afraid to walk back home by yourself? These are the elements that Halloween is made of and ""Trick 'r Treat"" promises to deliver them.

Most horror movies nowadays are nothing more then pointless gore/torture fests or unnecessary remakes. Don't get me wrong, they too have their place in the world of horror, but it is getting rather redundant, and this is why Trick 'r Treat offers a breath of fresh air to the horror movie goer. This film doesn't waste a single scene as each one is a necessary contributer to the intertwined story lines (trust me, It was cleverly done). Both the directing and writing were excellent as well as the acting. The characters were not given much background which only adds to the mystery and lets your imagination take over. Were there any dry spots? No way! Trick r' Treat instantly dives into a pool of terror and constantly injects the viewer with of a feeling of horror anxiety. Sure, there were a couple of moments in this film that everyone has seen in other horror movies before, but It didn't feel like it was stealing those ideas, rather it was paying tribute. The very few predictable moments of the movie do not, in anyway, strip or tear down the value, quality or entertainment of this film. It is sad that Trick 'r Treat never made it to theaters and has become a needle in a haystack, but it's movies like these that are cultivated into cult classics.

Overall, if you love Halloween and you love classic horror movies, then I absolutely guarantee that Trick 'r Treat will easily become one of your new favorite horror films.

3908489,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick `R Treat is a film that has been talked about for a couple of years.  Originally intended for a theatrical release, it was finally released direct-to-DVD and is one of the best Halloween films to come along since, well, Halloween in 1978.  Trick `R Treat was written and Directed by Michael Dougherty and produced by the X-Men's Bryan Singer.  No coincidentally, the film features a couple of X-Men cast members, Bryan Cox and Anna Paquin.

The film interweaves four distinct storylines and cleverly ties them all together in the climax.  Dylan Baker plays a nerdish elementary school principal who moonlights as a serial killer, and delights in ""teaching"" kids about the true meaning of Halloween.

Anna Paquin (From True Blood) is Laurie, a 22 year-old virgin.  Laurie's sister Danielle, and her friends are trying to find the perfect guy for Laurie and urge her to attend a local Halloween party.  But Laurie, dressed as Little Red Riding Hood, instead visits a Halloween festival where she is stalked by a hooded figure.

Four kids decided to play a devious prank on Rhonda, an idiot savant but called a retard by the mean-spirited kids.  They take Rhonda to a rock quarry, the scene of a terrible bus accident some thirty years where a busload of mentally-challenged kids tumbled into the deep quarry.

Finally, Bryan Cox is cantankerous Mr. Kreeg, old man whose house is avoided like the plague by the neighborhood children on Halloween night...except one tiny trick-or-treater wearing a burlap mask who seems intent on delivering a few tricks to Kreeg.

Set in a typical middle-class town in Ohio, Trick `R Treat embraces Halloween tradition in a full bear hug.  This is what Halloween is all about, especially in the mid-west where leaves litter the sidewalks, Jack-o-lanterns and picked and carved, kids play pranks and trick-or-treat for candy, houses with picket fences are decorated for the season, local urban legends abound, and adults revert to their own childhood and cavort in costumes.

While its rated ""R"" it's a mild ""R"" for a brief bit of nudity and language.  There's some gore but its tongue-in-cheek gore, not unlike the kind of props you can buy at this time of year.  Dougherty skillfully shuttles the film back and forth to different times during the night, so you can see how all of the pieces of the story ultimately fit together.  Even seemingly mundane scenes have their importance later in the film, requiring the viewer to pay attention to everything.  Trick `R Treat works because it IS Halloween.  It looks like Halloween, smells like Halloween.  It's a tribute to all the traditions that we grew up on as kids but also an exceedingly well-crafted horror film at the same time.  This is one that is destined to become annual required viewing every October!",1276128000,,2797,4.908510638297872

Second: The movie's layout sort of reminds me of the way those Creep Show movies of the 80's were made. Several different stories into one movie. This movie has four basic stories but unlike the Creep Show, the stories in Trick 'R Treat all link together.

We get four stories, woven together like a shroud, complete w/ monsters, a demon, a serial murderer, and vengeful undead!

3908499,5,B002CYIR34,"In October of 2007, a film was briefly marketed and then abruptly shelved by Warner Brothers. The film in question was Michael Dougherty's TRICK `R TREAT, and the theatrical trailer looked promising. Audiences were frustrated when Warner Brothers repeatedly pushed back the release date, and then, without warning, pulled the film completely out of the public eye.

There are a few reasons why this would have happened. For instance, Warner Brothers had just suffered from the box office dud that was SUPERMAN RETURNS, which was directed by Bryan Singer and was written by Michael Dougherty, who eventually helmed TRICK `R TREAT. Both individuals were probably seen as potential risk hazards for executives at Warner Brothers considering the failure of their previous film. Another reason could have been that they simply did not want to compete with the latest SAW-fest. Whatever the case, the people responsible for the marketing of this film should be ashamed - very ashamed - of themselves. TRICK `R TREAT premiered at several different film festivals, and won the audience award at Screamfest. Harry Knowles and other critics hailed it as one of the greatest Halloween films ever made. With all of the positive hype surrounding the film, no one could quite understand why the good people at WB had remained silent about it.

As of next Tuesday, TRICK `R TREAT will be released...on DVD. Now, there is a stigma attached to straight-to-DVD fare. This is for a reason. Getting a straight-to-DVD release is a bona-fide guarantee that the film sucks. It's never a good sign. However, TRICK `R TREAT is the exception to that rule. Technically, you could say that it doesn't qualify in the S.T.D.V.D. hall of shame simply because it actually screened in theatres, and won awards and critical acclaim, and you'd be right. The film is excellent. It is everything that you would expect it to be and more. It is the little Hallow's Eve indie that could, and has already gained a strong cult following.

What we have here is an homage to eighties horror films, such as CREEPSHOW, TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE: THE MOVIE, and CAT'S EYE. Each film is basically split up into three or four segments, each one telling a different story. TRICK `R TREAT follows this formula, but the narrative structure has more in common with PULP FICTION than anything else. The film is fun. It's not going to keep you up at night, but if you are on its wavelength, you are going to have one hell of a good time! With all of that being said, the film does have it's disturbing moments, but the humor contained within the film tends to balance it all out. We have stories of demons, zombies, werewolves, vampires...we even have a story that centers around an elementary school principal - played by Dylan Baker, with just the right amount of creepiness that made his deranged character in HAPPINESS so memorable and disturbing - who just so happens to be a serial killer. He knocks off children one by one by poisoning their candy. Afterwards, he proceeds to bury them in his backyard, while his son watches admiringly from the window.  Yeah, this segment of the film was pretty controversial, and was probably another factor that caused mainstream film executives to shelve the film.

In short, it's the most fun that I have had with this particular genre in a long time! Both creepy and hilarious at the same time, this film delivers what it promises, and for those of you who have followed the film up until now, I can tell you this: believe the hype, it's all true - one of the best Halloween films that I have ever seen. If you love Halloween as much as I do, you'll understand why I loved it so much! Michael Dougherty has given us an instant classic.

I think all the actors/actresses did great jobs. - Except for the dude who plays Helo on Battlestar Galactica. I thought he was doing ok right up until his very last shot. It was so bad I rewound it a couple of times so we could laugh. Now if that's what they were going for, then great, I have no complaints.

3908504,5,B002CYIR34,"Although horror films come and go throughout each and every year, there are very few that try and succeed at capturing the mood of the Halloween holiday. Not since John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>, has the holiday been so beautifully captured and capitalized upon -- that is, up until now.

""Trick r' Treat"" is a horror anthology much in the vein of Stephen King and George A. Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow/dp/B002GHHHG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow</a>&nbsp;and is the first film directed by Bryan Singer protg Michael Dougherty. Based on a 1996 short-film/animation, ""Seasons Greetings,"" the film features the likes of Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Leslie Bibb and Dylan Baker in its cast. The story is split into five separate tales, all interweaving through one another and finally coming full circle in the end. Throughout the 83 minutes the film effortlessly conforms to, we are treated to a sick serial-killer/principal sharing his hobbies with his son, a group of horny young women preying on unsuspecting men who perhaps need a shaving (see: werewolves), a prank conceived by children gone terribly wrong, and a crotchety old man who finds his past demons coming back to haunt him.

All five stories are connected not only by certain characters bumping into one another, but more importantly, by a mysterious trick or treater known only as Sam. With his burlap-bag mask and grimy pajamas, he manages to creep into each story to ensure that the Halloween tradition is kept with, punishing those who disrespect the holiday. Despite the fact that this character doesn't say anything and is given virtually no background, he manages to become an iconic force in the movie. His visage is one that is sure to be remembered for years, as the film gains its inevitable cult-status.

For a first time director, Dougherty provokes quite some disturbing imagery, with the aid of some arresting cinematography and outlandish costume and set designs. There's plenty of atmosphere to go around, and amidst some of the black humor at play, the film never once loses its illusion. Whatever time of year you view this in, it will put you in the Halloween spirit, which is perhaps its only real goal. It's a shame that it got the shaft by Warner Brothers that it did. Had it been given a proper theatrical release, it likely would have had a larger impact on not only the genre, but the pop-culture landscape in general. Its direct-to-DVD dumping certainly doesn't do it justice, as even the most jaded of horror fans will find this to be a true treat.",1265760000,2,2751,5.437939110070258
3908505,4,B002CYIR34,"This is like the film Crash for the horror crowd. Many characters are introduced and what characters they all are. This seemingly benign suburb turns eerie in the most charming fashion. All these characters and their stories come together in the end and I didn't find it hard to follow. Like Murder Party and its beginning montage of Halloween scenes, this one starts with an old infomercial about Halloween and trick or treating. Again, a charming way to begin this journey which turns out to be a love letter to Halloween, its traditions and horror films in general. There are many homage scenes yet this remains so thoroughly original that you find yourself enwrapped in this film that has a Creepshow/Tales From the Crypt feeling throughout, though not quite as campy as either one. Very well scripted with a sprinkle of humor and intelligence and a touch of irony that you don't see all that often in the horror genre. The direction isn't heavy handed in this piece and the look of this film is wonderful. Pumpkins and oranges with colors of fall, fog, white sheets mix and mingle with costumes and masks like a bag of Brachs Autumn Mix.

It's not very scary(perhaps is wasn't ment to be)and some of the story line faulters while trying to ""keep up"" with a ""creep Show"" type story telling experience. I think that if it would have gone through another re-write and preferibly a slightly larger budget to improve some of the visual FX it could have been improved a great deal. Aside from some of the campyness and hokeness(much of which I suspect was intentional)it was a OK film. However,if I were to ever be part of the food chain,I could not think of a better way to go than to be devoured by Anna Paquin and a bunch of other half naked, hot werewolf chicks dressed up as cheerleaders,Little Bo Peep, Red Riding Hood or Snow White. I would have liked to have seen more,but you get what you pay for.

The film did a great job of substituting cheap scares using loud noises with non-predictable twists and turns. The biggest shock in this film is how well thought out and made it is and how important it will become in the Halloween/Horror genre of movies.

3908513,4,B002CYIR34,"Trick 'r Treat (2008) is a horror movie that was completed in 2007 but never had a theatrical release.  Instead, it went straight to DVD two years later, in October 2009.  The reason why it was never released in theaters was because the critics felt it wasn't worthy of it and perhaps because the movie contains some disturbing scenes.  I usually find a lot of movie critics to be wrong when it comes to rating movies.  The critics are not right all the time.  They are WRONG so much of the time.  I don't know if I agree with the critics on this one.

Based on the reviews, it seems that the general public generally likes this movie.  I also generally like it.  I think it was a good effort and a refreshing change from the typical slasher movies of today.  There are actually four stories taking place at the same time that tie together.  It reminds me of how George Lucas approaches movie making, such as in the Star Wars movies.  A strong point of this movie is that it deals with the traditions amongst kids on Halloween night.  Also, there is a brief mention of the Celtic origins of Halloween in ancient Ireland.  I don't think there has been a movie since Halloween III (1982) that has dealt with this subject matter.  Another thing - this movie's late-October-in-the-Midwest autumn/Halloween atmosphere can't be beat.  The movie takes place in a town in Ohio.  This movie has the Midwest autumn atmosphere that John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) lacked for the most part.  When Carpenter's Halloween was filmed in May 1978, it was filmed in southern California.  Palm trees appear on the screen every once in a while, along with mountains in the background (when Dr. Sam Loomis is in the phone booth).  Flowers are blooming in the backyard of the Wallace house.  I could go on and on, but you get the picture.  Carpenter did the best he could to create an autumn atmosphere in May in southern California.  Hampered by a small budget, it prevented him from shooting the movie in the Midwest in the fall.  Trick 'r Treat has everything that is Halloween in the Midwest - dry leaves falling from trees, the characters can see their breath (it almost looks like CGI breath), dampness, coldness, fog, tons of jack-o-lanterns and Halloween decorations, etc.

This movie features four stories that play out simultaneously.  I found that the jumping around from story to story made the movie somewhat hard to follow the first time I watched it.  I have since watched it a few more times and I don't find it as hard to follow.  One flaw with this movie is that these four stories occur during a very short movie (only 82 minutes).  Not nearly enough time is allowed for each individual story to play out with character development and connect to the other stories in any meaningful way.  As a result, the characters come across as shallow and thin and the overall plot suffers from a lack of development and direction.  By the time all the characters are introduced in each individual story, you barely have time for a plot.  I think it would have been better if this movie was a single story or two stories at the most.  If it would have been, for example, two stories, the plot would have been better developed, characters would have more depth to them, and if there's a sequel in the future, the two unused stories can be used.  I found that I never really got to know the characters or even cared about them.  Near the beginning of the movie there are some ditzy girls in their early twenties who are trying on Halloween costumes at a Halloween costume store.  They end up walking out of the store wearing the costumes they had just tried on and it appears that they might not have paid for them.  These are shallow characters that I never cared about (though they were nice to look at).  But in John Carpenter's Halloween, for example, I found that I cared for Laurie and Annie and Linda, etc.  This was not the case with most of the characters in Trick 'r Treat.  They're just sort of there.  They're mostly teenagers and adults in their early twenties, along with lots of little kids trick-or-treating.  The movie is called Trick 'r Treat, so naturally there is going to be lots of kids.  But I think overall this movie was geared toward a teen audience.  Now when it comes to my favorite characters, they were Rhonda (played by Samm Todd) and Laurie (played by Anna Paquin).  Why????  It's because these two characters were the only ones with any depth to them.  Rhonda is a nerdy type who dresses up as a witch and knew about the Celtic origins of Halloween in ancient Ireland.  Laurie was a suppressed and innocent 22-year old dressed as Little Red Riding Hood.

One more thing about the stories - I thought the stories themselves were somewhat on the weak side.  The best story and the one with the best atmosphere was the one about the school bus.  The worst one was the school principal who moonlights as a serial killer.  That was just plain SICK.  He's basically teaching his son how to be a murderer - kind of ""showing him the ropes"".  And apparently the guy doesn't think the cops will ever see the hole he has dug in his backyard.  The story involving the hermit was unique and reasonably effective.  The one involving the transformation of the girls into vampires and werewolves was quite weird, though I did enjoy it visually.

Overall, I don't think the movie was that scary.  It had a few moments, but it seemed like a lot was predictable, like I've seen this sort of stuff play out in countless other horror movies over the years.  We've all seen so many horror movies over the years that feature, for example, teenagers who are set up to die, but you never get to know the characters leading up to their demise.  I put this movie into that category.  This movie was also a little on the campy side.  This diluted some of the scariness.  I think this movie tries to be too many things at once jam packed into 78 minutes (82 minutes if you include the credits).  It's a gorey slasher film at times, it's a comedy at times, it's a children's story at times, it's a teenager movie at times, it's an adult movie with nudity and sexual overtones, etc.  John Carpenter's Halloween has all of these elements as well (Michael Myers is the killer stalker, PJ Soles provides comic relief, little kids have babysitters, teenagers are partying and sleeping together), but the difference is that Halloween was much scarier than Trick 'r Treat.  This movie is rated G, PG, PG-13, R, and X all in one.  Certain scenes have that Steven Spielberg feel to it, kind of like Poltergeist, while other scenes are like John Carpenter's Halloween or Friday The 13th.

The musical score is pretty decent, but I don't find it really memorable.  It's definitely not in the same category as John Carpenter's Halloween theme or The Exorcist theme, for example.

I noticed that the woman in the beginning of the movie was taking down the Halloween decorations in the front yard right in the middle of trick-or-treating.  Huh?

Another thing I didn't care for was the foul language used by really young kids - I mean, some of these kids were 10, 11, 12 years old and they're dropping the ""F"" bomb like it's nothing.  They're also making references to sexual acts.  It shows how kids and society as a whole have changed dramatically in a short period of time.  Now if these kids were teenagers who were 17, 18, 19 years old, that would be different.  But it was shocking to hear this vulgar language come out of the mouths of such young kids.

It's amazing - Halloween's popularity is at an all-time high, but it seems the horror movies of today can't hold a candle to the horror movies of decades ago.  The horror movies of today seem to be either slasher movies or terrible remakes of classics.  I give the makers of Trick 'r Treat tons of credit for coming up with something a little different with a great Halloween atmosphere.  It's a good movie, but not a great movie.  It suffers from being a short 82 minutes long, some predictability, and lack of character and plot development.  I know this movie is destined to have a cult following, but I don't know if it's a classic.  It's not scary enough and the score isn't memorable enough, in my opinion.  At least right now, it's a hot fad.  Just like when it comes to music, fads come and go.  There was disco.  There was punk.  There was new wave.  There were the metal hair bands.  There was grunge.  But I find that I always go back to the classic stuff.  I'll listen to Black Sabbath instead of Cinderella any day.  When it comes to horror movies, I'll watch The Haunting (1963) instead of Halloween Resurrection (2002) any day.  Get what I mean?

I guess I agree with Trick 'r Treat being called ""The Best Halloween Film Of The Last 30 Years.""  In other words, the best Halloween-themed movie SINCE John Carpenter's Halloween (1978).  Take this movie's outstanding Midwest autumn/Halloween atmosphere and couple it with a stronger and scarier SINGLE story with a memorable soundtrack and it might have been able to claim the title of greatest Halloween-themed movie of all time.  The way I see it, the door continues to be left open for somebody out there to step in and put it all together and make THE definitive Halloween movie of ALL TIME, which would de-throne John Carpenter's Halloween.

3908517,4,B002CYIR34,"I'm a fan of classic monster movies and I liked this film quite a bit. I liked that it created a mythology around the holiday, like Jack 'O Lanterns are used to protect us from evil spirits, etc. I liked that we see what happens when those evil spirits are unchecked. Most of the scares are in the vein of the Creepshow movies, but that's OK. I'm sick of seeing endless slasher flicks. Serial killers are so boring, you see them on the news every day. Give me a monster any day. Monsters suggest that maybe we don't know all the rules; that our world does offer some magic and mystery.
  I thought that the film's flexible timeline a la Pulp Fiction was quite inventive. The individual stories are woven together by the presence of a kid in a creepy costume with a burlap mask. We learn that all is not what it seems.
  If you're after maximum shock and gore, this film is not for you. If you enjoy the spirit of the better horror films, you will find this one to be quite fun.",1261612800,,977,4.236559139784946
3908518,4,B002CYIR34,"The years of anticipation and internet buzz have set the bar much too high for this very good, but not great film. As movies ABOUT Halloween go, this is definitely a classic. No other film has made the myths and traditions about Halloween the focal point, which is definitely a tall order to fill. It comes across as a whimsical holiday lesson in narrative form.

The film is a beautiful work of art. Every single shot is perfectly composed, lighted and orchestrated, and the actors are all wonderfully game. Perhaps its greatest weakness is that the film is mostly ""just frosting"" (like those stunning wedding cakes that taste ""just okay""). The heart is missing. As an audience we are never compelled to care about any of the characters, and we are never fully engaged in the thin plot. This is typical of anthologies that have such little time to get their point across, and to make matters worse, the movie is shockingly short.

This movie is a love letter to holiday that evokes memories of childhood wonder and fright about the darkest night of the year. This is for fans of Halloween, Halloween kitsch, and independent filmmaking.

3908519,4,B002CYIR34,"On a Halloween night in Warren Valley, Ohio, four stories converge presided over by the ghost of Halloween. From vampires and werewolves to zombies and murderous school principals. Just make sure you follow the traditions of Halloween, or Halloween could come for you!

It might be a little late to review a movie based on Halloween, but the timeliness of a movie never deters me from checking it out and telling people about it! Of course, the film in question was originally set for theatrical release in October of 2007, but, despite rave reviews from the festival circuit, was pushed back to a straight to DVD release in October of 2009. Written and directed by Michael Dougherty (co-writer for Superman Returns and X2) and produced by Bryan Singer (director of X-Men, X-2, The Usual Suspects, and Superman Returns), Trick 'r Treat is an interesting film, but does it deserve status as a straight to DVD film, or should it have been released theatrically?

In the end, I have to say that Trick 'r Treat got a raw deal. Dougherty does a great job paying homage to old school horror films with a film that doesn't really take itself seriously and still feels fresh at the same time. Centering around one Halloween night, the movie deals mainly in the idea of what happens when one chooses not to follow the traditions of Halloween. The ""Ghost of Halloween"", as I like to call him, appears to be an amalgam of ideas from Chucky to Evil Dead to Jack Skellington to even a little Freddy Krueger. It's in portrayals like these that we really see the strength of Dougherty's creations, he spins typical horror movie ideas such as serial killers and werewolves and spins them in a way that's witty and fresh at the same time.

In horror films it's not typically reasonable to ask one to look at the acting as anything more than a device to push along the scares, but when you have the acting pedigree of a film like Trick 'r Treat you have to sit up and take notice. With the talent of actors and actresses like Dylan Baker (Revolutionary Road, Spider-Man 1-3, etc.), Tahmoh Penikett (Battlestar Galactica, Dollhouse, etc.), Anna Paquin (X-Men series, True Blood, etc.), Leslie Bibb (Talladega Nights, ER, etc.), Brian Cox (X-2, The Bourne Trilogy, etc.), and more. Naturally, with this much talent packed into one film, you're going to judge the acting on a little higher scale, and you won't be disappointed!

On the downside though, the film does go a little over the top at times, and doesn't appear to have the budget to sustain some of it's higher ambitions. The main part that comes to mind, is the scene of the big werewolf reveal. Some of the special effects should have been handled in a manner that didn't show as much of the creatures leaving more to the imagination. But finding a perfect horror film is near impossible, and finding one that's even this good is few and far between, so a couple gaffs can easily be forgotten when viewed against the film as a whole.

I highly recommend this film, it's a rare feat to see a horror film that bucks many of the time honored (or dishonored) traditions of the modern horror film while also paying homage to many of the horror films in the past while also feeling fresh all at the same time. I must warn you, if you plan on watching this with the kids the film does contain nudity, strong language, and, being a horror film, disturbing imagery. I suggest watching it yourself before you allow the kids to watch it. But definitely watch it!

I rented it from Netflix and it sat atop my DVD player for a few weeks before I finally had an opportunity to watch it.  When I finally got to it, my only disappointment was that it took me so long to get to it.  I watched the movie on a Saturday and bought my own copy on Sunday.  I'm not one to buy a lot of movies, so if you know me, that means something.  This movie is fantastic.  I loved every single thing about it.  My sole complaint would be that it's too darn short.  I loved the overlapping/interwoven storylines, the humor, the wonderful twists and surprises, the sense of familiarity while still being quite unique .  The acting, direction, screenplay and cinematography were all on par with each other.  Frankly, there isn't one thing I would change about it, except the aforementioned length.  If you love your horror served up old school, you will lap this baby up because it shamelessly harkens back to those heady, glory days of 70's and early 80's horror.  The film doesn't take itself too seriously nor does it want you too, either.  It's a thrill ride with all the requisite twists and turns and when it's all over and done with, I guarantee you'll be smiling begging for another go around.  I don't want to write too much for fear of giving anything away so I'll just limit my review to trying to convey the enthusiasm the film engendered in me.  The comparisons to both Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt are right on the money, so suffice it to say that if you are a fan of either or both, you will most definitely love Trick `r Treat.

The fact that it went the straight-to-video route is a crying shame because, without question, this is the best American horror movie I've seen this year. How refreshing to find a story that intrigues instead of disgusts, that pays homage to the horror genre without rehashing old ideas or dipping into gratuitous gore. The film follows four stories happening concurrently in one small town on Halloween night. The stories are those of a group of ambitious middle school kids working on a project; four 20-something girls looking for a party; a school principal engaging in his favorite hobbies; and a crotchety older gentleman who just wants to be left alone, all of whom learn memorable lessons about respecting the holiday by the night's end. The movie's gorgeous, eerie scenery is drenched in classic Halloween imagery and colors, and equal parts scares and humor come together to make this a wicked little treat of a film.

If you like horror movies, but are disgusted by the endless remakes and re-treads that are polluting cinema plexes everywhere, do not miss this one. For me it will be one I plan to watch again and again! It is DESTINED to become a classic!",1260057600,,1146,4.40566037735849
3908526,2,B002CYIR34,"Even though Halloween's over, I watched this recently. Everybody seemed to be renting this when it came out and I wasn't able to get a copy in time. Perhaps, if I saw it in the correct season, it might have had more an effect, but I wasn't satisfied and it's received too much hype. Some of my thoughts:

- I think the ""Sam"" kid....well, demon...in the flour sack mask is cool. You only know it's known as ""Sam"" from the commentary in the mini-animation extra (there's no commentary on the movie). He looked a bit spooky in the mask; out of it...I was disappointed.

Actually...speaking of commentary...that will be found on the BLUE RAY release only. Along with deleted scenes. DVD is not an ancient/useless format and there's no reason at all for all the
extras to not be there...unless they are trying to 'force' people into using BLUE RAY.

- I thought the opening was okay. The woman blows out a jack o'lantern (apparently, that's not good to do before midnight) and ""Sam"" doesn't approve and takes care of her. One thing I
remember thinking: ""It's Halloween NIGHT...and she wants to take down all the decorations? Ridiculous.""

- The DVD had widescreen and full screen. Comparing the two, it seems obvious that full screen isn't showing you all the picture and I was disappointed in that.

- Even the guy at BLOCKBUSTER, when looking at my rentals, said that this one was pretty good. And the numerous reviews on ""YouTube"" claim it to be wonderful, a favourite of theirs, or whatever; I haven't found a bad one there yet. It's not THAT great, geez. It's not a long movie and was bearable, but so many people acting like you'll need to see it to make your life complete is way-off.

- I enjoyed the fall scenes and some of the acting. The killer principal was fun and had a good look/voice and the kids did alright for the most part.",1259971200,5,1838,4.537764350453172

For me, the best thing about Trick R Treat is that the filmmakers have perfectly captured the look and feel of Halloween.  Visually and emotionally, this movie IS Halloween.  I have to give credit for the time and attention that went into all the little details that added up to my enjoyment of the movie.  A couple of examples: when the little savant girl/witch goes looking for her ""friends"", that scene is so eerie....so quiet, you can hear her feet crunching through the leaves and mud.  Another incredible/creepy scene for me was the set up for the Halloween School Bus Massacre.  The look of the trees against a twilight-orange sky was incredible, and I can't even describe those HIDEOUS masks the kids were wearing.  That storyline was by far the creepiest for me, and I almost wish they had based the entire movie on that one story.  Overall, I really enjoyed Trick R Treat.  There was enough suspense and black humor to keep me entertained, although I would have preferred more suspense and a little less gore (carving the kid's HEAD???).  Above all else, this movie made me feel the true spirit of Halloween~ the fear, the playfulness, and the feeling that not everything is as it seems.

There was a lot of hype surrounding this film, and it came from all different directions so who really knows if it was fan-generated or studio-generated.  But this movie is by no means groundbreaking.

That doesn't mean it isn't fun, though.  It's just not as earth-shatteringly fun as the hype would have you believe.

Basically the film consists of four separate stories interwoven with each other.  The tale of the kids paying their respects on the anniversary of the school bus massacre really falls a bit flat.  The old geezer (the underrated Brian Cox) burns old pictures in his fireplace, but given the subject of the pictures, I wonder why he waited so many years to do it.  The school principal would have made for a creepier villain if his first-shown victim wasn't a horror-movie stereotype.  The Little Red Riding Hood tale had an interesting twist, however.

All in all, a decent Halloween romp but not the mind-blowing experience the hype would have you believe.

Vampires, boogeymen, the dangers trick-or-treaters face, and a small goblin-like creature are just some of the film's goodies. Viewers should be warned that certain themes might not be appropriate for children, especially young children. The best thing about the film is that it captures the spirit of the holiday like no film since John Carpenter's Halloween did, and around here, at least, it will be brought out every October to celebrate Halloween, a new tradition.

3908541,2,B002CYIR34,"I first saw the preview to this movie years ago, and it mentioned an upcoming theatrical release. At the time, the trailer seemed interesting enough, I'd see it when it became a rental. After the release was pulled, I didn't get dragged into the hype, but it still stuck in my mind, ""When will this movie get released?"".

Well, eventually it was released. I watched the Blu-ray. I knew I was in trouble after the first 5-10 minutes. After that amount of time, it clicked, this felt like a made-for-tv movie, only with more blood. Not sure how to explain ""Made-for-TV"", but that's the vibe it gave off. It's a similar feeling that some ""Direct-to-video"" movies give off, which is what this is...

The stories, they would have been better on their own, maybe a few tie-ins here and there, but it jumps around a lot from one story to another, and there doesn't seem to be much reason for it. They don't tie together very well, and 3 of the 4 I found pretty dull. The story about the bus, while not a winner, was better than the 3 others.

Also, the first story, as it progressed, I thought back to the movie Parents. Oh, see Parents if you haven't, it's a decent film.

With Trick R Treat, don't expect much from the stories. They aren't frightening, and a bit cartoonish and predicatable. It seemed more geared towards teenagers, and I think the movie may have had a theatrical release if there were a some edits for a PG-13 rating.

Bottom line; it left me rolling my eyes, and it became very clear to me why this movie didn't get released into theatres. With the comic book featured in the opening credits, it made me think back on Creepshow. Though, after it began, I could tell this wasn't going to be as fun as Creepshow.",1258588800,7,1724,4.443037974683544

3908546,4,B002CYIR34,"I give this movie 5 stars, but I give the actual DVD 3 stars, which averages out to 4 stars.  The movie itself is now one of my favorite Halloween movies.  It is in fact a Halloween movie about the nature and traditions of Halloween, and completely lives up to that bit of playfulness.  The movie is kept short, though its flashback style of storytelling sometimes clashes with the individual vignettes that make up the story of the film, but the intentionally graphic and twisted events of ""Trick 'r Treat"" make up for its flawed structuring.  This movie is not for everyone, but for those looking for a Halloween themed film with shocks, creeps, gore (and Anna Paquin), to replace the dead horse that has become the ""Saw"" series and its ilk that have pervaded theatres and DVDs over the past few years, this is definitely a much appreciated treat.  For those who don't know, Sam is the potato-sack masked kid on the movie poster, and he is certainly now one of my horror movie heroes.

I did not care for this DVD however, because it does not come with a mini-documentary on Halloween that is available on the Bluray.  There is really no reason that the documentary could not have been on both; it was simply a way for Warner Brothers to milk the much delayed film for all the money it could.  Shame on them for not honoring the spirit of the season.  May Sam judge them accordingly.",1257897600,2,1385,4.508
3908547,2,B002CYIR34,"How do you sell such a film? Obviously, the studio didn't know how. It's a shame to see how some executives think for ourselves. What we will like or what we won't understand.

This film, in my humble opinion, isn't a great film. It's full of little things that threw me off. But it is original and it is trying to be different. And it is well made. The director was honest with what he wanted to do. If more films were done with such a creative spirit, it would elevate the standard of horror films and we, the viewers, would benefit from it.

But a cult film? Maybe because of its form. But the acting was pretty uneven (the girl who makes her friend go to the pit goes from being innocent to twisted too fast, i thought). And you don't really know how to classify this movie. Horror? I wasn't scared. Dark Humor? I didn't laugh. Torture Porn? No real gore here. Suspense thriller? I wasn't on the edge of my seat. No, i think that it was just fun. As simple as that. A dark fantasy based on a unrealistic urban legend. Original and honest with its premise. I was annoyed, though, with the trivialization of the violence done to children, which you see more and more in horror movies nowadays. Is it a sick trend? Too much torture porn so we need something more ugly to get people's attention? Like violence toward children? But other than that, i was fascinated by this film without never being emotionally drawn to it. Bizarre. It's quaint.

And is it just me or is the score reminiscent of the one heard in the old ""Friday The 13th""?

""..the best Halloween film in the last 30 years"" - [...] (on DVD cover)

What film did I see?
Completely corny from start to end. I'm actually more frightened by some of the posters on this board...

1. That principal and his son story put me to sleep. I admit the kid was adorable but the story was boring and not scary or even interesting.

2. The school bus plunge kids story was just not done well. There was no creep factor at all and the resulting clincher was kinda dry. They could've played it out a little better.

3. The werewolf chick party story was completely done in countless movies and those who are fans of horror movies are tired of seeing it. Anna Paquin's unique face is the only upside to this story and movie in general.

4. The Pumpkin Sack kid killer was played out like a cartooon. No one I watched it with cared about the outcome because everyone was sleepy by then.

If Hollywood keeps putting out crap like this no one is gonaa actually go to the movies but 12 year olds just to leave the house.

3908558,3,B002CYIR34,"""Trick 'r Treat"" (produced by Brian Singer) consists of four loosely interconnected events that happen on one Halloween night. The film's slightly tongue-in-cheek approach to the horror genre might remind you of the TV anthology series ""Tales from the Crypt"" this time without the talkative crypt keeper. This means if you are looking for scares and jolts, you should look elsewhere.

The place is Warren Valley, Ohio, where some terrible things are about to happen. Some characters are not what they seem. A mild-mannered school principal (Dylan Baker) has a secret or two to hide from the kids visiting his house; a ""virgin"" Laurie (Anna Paquin) walks alone in the woods wearing the costume of Little Red Riding Hood; and Scrooge-like grumpy neighbor (Brian Cox) receives strange visitation from you know what.

""Trick 'r Treat"" is written and directed by Michael Dougherty, co-writer for Brian Singer-directed ""X2"" and ""Superman Returns."" This film is the feature-film debut for him and obviously he has a talent. Atmospheric and sometimes creepy, the film's story unravels very smoothly without giving away too much - or maybe too smoothly. There are no highs and lows throughout the whole events, which themselves are neither scary nor funny enough. It is not surprising that this film was not theatrically released. The studio - and perhaps some of us too - doesn't know what exactly the film is all about.

Finally, some part of the story is related to the origins and long traditions of Halloween. This is an admirable effort on the part of the filmmaker, but the tales themselves told in the film needs more originality and power. ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a pretty enjoyable ride though those who are looking for something scary will find it otherwise.",1257379200,,1756,5.006849315068493

First let me say this movie should be named GOOSEBUMPS THE MOVIE.  Forget about the R Rating.  This movie could easily pass for PG with 3 seconds cut and must have asked for the R Rating.

The movie did horrible at test screening 3 years ago so the studio buried it.  They finally came up with the plan to get a lot of bloggers to writer almost the same review and go to sites like IMDB and have everyone rate the movie 10 out of 10.  This movie had a 9.4 rating with 500 votes at one time on IMDB and a bunch of people advertising that you must buy the Blu Ray before it sells out.

This is not a good Direct to Video release.  It does have solid camera work but fails everyone else.  The writing is horrendous and the fx are quite subpar.

This movie is terrible. I couldn't believe it. I sensed something was wrong right off the bat. Things were jerky and jumpy. The viewer is introduced to quite a few characters very quickly and things are happening but not much is tying together. I figured to give it a bit of time to settle but that didn't really happen. There are several stories running simultaneously and they either do not tie together at all or they tie in so loosely that there is little if any sense of homogeneity.
There are some aspects to some of the stories that are clever in the way that a punchline might be clever in a joke, but it's far from satisfying here.

I found very little sense of tension or building to a climax. It was just one scene after another with little direction or form. I also thought that having all these horrible things all happening in one small community was a huge mistake. That one story is played out makes sense. That several stories play out is preposterous.

The Burning, The Fog, The hills have eyes remake, Suspiria, House by the cemetery, Street trash, Fun house, Dawn, day and night of the living dead..... and much more, so, I heard the extreme hype about ""Trick r Treat"" and had to have it. My girlfriend picked it up for me and even she was excited...our friends arrived and we put it in the dvd player and felt utterly disrespected. The story line and how things were connected was the only thing that had us slightly interested, but every other aspect of the movie was horrible, aside maybe from some good acting. I had read many reviews here on amazon and elsewhere stating that this is a horror classic....people, were these reviews written by warner brothers folks pushing the dvd sale????? Maybe someone can explain the film to me....point out something i missed.....show me some artistic aspect that slipped by me???  there was nothing to this film except it was well written, nothing scared us....kept us in suspense....or made us say wow that was deep or even say ""Great FX !""....I should have known when i found out it was directed by the cat who did the superman and x men flick...he should have stayed with that genre of film.

All of my guests were totally dissapointed and i, having a deeper connection to horror films since the days of my teens watching horror triple features on ""The Deuce"" (42nd street in NYC back in the days) was crushed Ha Ha Ha, and hurt !  As i have reached my late 30's i don't dig too much gore and brutal violence in films unless it might possibly serve a purpose, so i want you to understand that my hostility towards ""trick r treat"" comes from a well versed and educated perspective about horror movies, not just a shallow need to be barbarically entertained. I refuse to even talk about the films characters, plot or whatever else....Do you know what movie we put in after ""trick r treat"" ? ...we watched Creepshow , a true horror anthology.....a CLASSIC... everybody cheered, and clapped and felt rejuvenated. I think we were suckered with ""Trick r Treat"".....somebody at warner bros. put up allot of dough to make this and after it never made the theaters they had to find a way to get some of their bread back...so DVD sales were the only way. Many people might disagree with me about this film.....but i bet you one thing....some of these names on these reviews on amazon are made up, and behind the name lies some WB employees.......

This movie was emphatically overrated.....

3908566,4,B002CYIR34,"'Trick 'r Treat' is a slick, well conceptualized production that cleverly blends four Halloween events taking place simultaneously in the same town on the spookiest night of the year. Yes the spirits are out and about on All Hallows Eve and they're goal is to instruct both believers and unbelievers that there's more than candy at stake. Halloween has rules based on ancient traditions and one better know what they are. If you have any questions just ask Sam (Samhain), if you dare.

This film took some intelligent, original ideas and brought them to the screen masterfully. I found it to be surprisingly enjoyable and atmospheric. The perfect choice for a Halloween's evening of entertainment. Just remember to keep the jack-o-lanterns lit and don't run out of candy.",1256947200,2,771,5.0234375
3908567,3,B002CYIR34,"This is a really well done movie, with different stories going on in each movie. there are plenty of shocking parts, some gore, a scene where a kid eats a candy bar he shouldn't & regurgitates a ton of chocolate. The gore wasn't too heavy - I found it to be very crisp and polished. It reminded me of Dreamcatcher , Tales from the Crypt and Creepshow. The stories all blended together like Sin City actyally. I thought the acting was good, the story was well written and directed. The movie moved at a great pace. Lots of great cinema photography and creepy scenes with fog, nice sets and so forth. Call it a sleeper or dark horse of horror movies this year. I recommend this one. Its a great Halloween horror, but you can almost watch this anytime you need to watch a good horror movie.
In my own opinion it was better than Hostel, SAW, The Fog remake and any Rob Zombie movie..

I am not sure who produced this thing, but I am pretty sure it was a 13 year old, still wetting the bed after having scary dreams.  I scare myself more in the morning looking in the mirror.

It doesn't help that there isn't a whole lot of horror in this film to begin with, no real scares (not even cheap ones) and its rather light on the gore and whats there is mundane by modern standards. This movie seemed like an attempt at a strictly Halloween themed version of Creep Show and with the typical EC Horror comics stylings, but it ends up stylistically and content wise having more in common with kiddie stuff like Goosebumps and the old Nickelodeon show Are You Afraid of The Dark? And despite all that it is rated R for some bizarre reason.

Its another example of something building up the usual amount unwarranted buzz because it was shelved for a couple of years and was released straight to dvd. I suspect that this flick still would be shelved if True Blood weren't as popular as it is.

3908575,5,B002CYIR34,"Bringing in eerie pumpkin imagery, old local legends, costume parties in the night forest, ghosts, monsters and all manner of spooky staples, Trick R Treat is one of the best Halloween-themed movies ever made, and one of 2009's best films.

  Despite billing to the contrary, Trick R Treat actually is Not an anthology, except in the very broadest sense.  There are several different stories in here, but they're not presented as distinct segments.  Instead they happen more or less simultaneously, on the same night in the same town, weaving in and out of one another's paths.  There's a tale of young kids exploring the site where a school bus full of deformed children allegedly met an untimely end years ago; there's a vampire prowling the Halloween parties in the streets preying on unsuspecting beauties; there's a story of a group of female friends going to a party in the woods where the shyest member (Anna Paquin from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Trilogy-X-Men-X2-X-Men-United-X-Men-The-Last-Stand/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)</a>) hopes to at last find her special someone; there's an old house where a cranky, volatile recluse harbors an old  secret; and several other concepts running here.  The movie switches back and forth between these threads throughout, sometimes bringing two or more together.  Oh, and there's the little fellow with the burlap mask pictured on the cover, an awesomely cool creation who could be horror's newest icon.  Though not a comedy, there are a number of moments of humor, usually black; there's gore and creatures brought to life with great special effects; there are occasional little wistful moments of tenderness and empathy; and there are genuine surprises in the twisted little plots that don't telegraph themselves.  Original, spooky, and sexy, this is a can't miss for horror fans.

It does have some humor and at times a campy element to it.  It does have a halloween theme to it, but that does not make this a seasonal classic.

What ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is to Christmas films..""Trick 'r Treat"" will be for Halloween. It captures the essence of the spirit of Halloween. In my opinion, the film plays great Homage to the old Vincent Price, Boris Karloff horror classics. Four great Halloween tales very cleverly woven in to one.

The setting and atmosphere of the film really grabs you and if you are not in Halloween mode before this film...you will be afterward. The writer & director put together 4 interesting tales that take you on a spooky Halloween adventure. If you are expecting a Gorey trite horror flick then this film is not for you.

The acting is really good and the direction is even better. The film is creepy but without overdoing it. It is scary without being too predictable. I cannot believe studios released Halloween II and put this film direct to video.

'Trick R Treat' is a wonderful and fun horror film with its share of good old fashioned scares, but where is really shines is how it captures the Halloween spirit and the overall feeling we want to have around this demonic holiday.

The story is really a series of short stories that are neatly woven together like the movies Pulp Fiction and Crash combined with the horror film Creepshow. It's not as scary as I would have liked..... but it's pretty hard to scare this old horror veteran any way, so I didn't expect to have nightmares! What I did get was a very entertaining horror film that captures the spirit of Halloween better than any other movie!

'Trick R Treat' is a very good horror film with enough scares and fun to keep most true horror fans happy and I can see this being a staple at Halloween at me house in the month of Shocktober for years to come! It may not be a classic, but only time will tell and I can see this becoming one or at least a ""cult classic"" in the years to come.",1256428800,4,1193,4.182608695652174

Unfortunately, it never got a decent release.  Just when I thought I'd never be able to watch this masterpiece, news that it's coming out in DVD was great news!!! Since I was not sure if it'll be released on video in the Philippines, I ordered via Amazon. Another wonderful surprise was how quickly Amazon shipped the DVD, I thought I won't be able to get it before Halloween. Alas! It came within two weeks from being shipped out from the US.

The movie was fantastic, it went beyond my expectations and will be one of my top favorites especially during October.  In the tradition of Creepshow, the movie tied together four different horror stories on that one time of the year when evil runs free.  There were a lot of unexpected twists that made me wanting more.  The casting is perfect!

The only thing I didn't like about the release is the lack of Special Features.  We only get the short film ""Season's Greetings"" where we see the 1996 origin of Sam.

3. Boring (I started to fall asleep during this one).
4. NOT scary at all.

3908590,5,B002CYIR34,"Michael Dougherty, writer on X2: X-Men United and Superman Returns, makes his directorial debut with Trick 'r Treat, an ambitious little horror anthology flick based on the holiday Halloween. Taking place in the fictional Ohio town of Warren Valley, the movie is comprised of four separate-yet-intertwined stories. Some, like producer Bryan Singer, have described Trick 'r Treat as ""Crash meets Creepshow,"" and it's a rather accurate summary.

School principal Steven Wilkins (Dylan Baker) moonlights as a murderer, feeding trick-or-treaters candy laced with poison and embedded with razorblades. Timid young woman Laurie (Anna Paquin) searches for ""her first time"" at the urging of her older sister and her promiscous friends, only to find herself the target of a blood-sucking stalker. A group of mischievous kids look to pay tribute to the victims of a Halloween bus accident and play a cruel prank on a young idiot savant girl, and crotchety Scrooge-like Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) gets a visit from a special trick-or-treater who will do more than pull down your underwear if you don't give him something good to eat.

I love this film because I'm obsessed with Halloween, and there are few films so truly and lovingly dedicated to it. Though personally, I didn't find Trick 'r Treat all that terrifying, I just may be too jaded after watching countless horror movies. However, there are a couple moments that made me jump and a vomit gag that did make me a little uneasy.

The effects are done the old-fashioned, practical way with only small, brief uses of CGI, which is very commendable. A lot of kids meet gruesome fates throughout the picture, a plot element that was rumored to have been the reason the movie was shelved by Warner Bros. for two years and never received a theatrical release. The effort Dougherty makes to share his enthusiasm for Halloween is truly admirable, and his love of the dark holiday is all over this film. For that reason, Trick 'r Treat still ranks along with John Carpenter's Halloween and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown as essential October viewing.

EXTRAS: An audio commentary with Michael Dougherty, Dougherty's animated short ""Season's Greetings"", which inspired the creation of Trick 'r Treat, and the documentary piece ""Trick 'R Treat: The Lore and Legends of Halloween"", which delve into the little-known origins of Halloween.",1256256000,9,2376,5.10025706940874
3908591,4,B002CYIR34,"Halloween has long been my favorite holiday.  And every year, as the air gets colder and the leaves start to turn, I begin what could best be described as a mild obsession with all things Halloween-related.  Naturally, I am a die-hard horror movie fan.  But I'm also a sucker for non-horror movies such as ""Monster House"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", for their Halloween themes.

""Trick 'r Treat"" immediately appeals to me for both its Halloween imagery and its dark humor.  Indeed, it is a lovely and loving tribute to the holiday.  The mischievous spirit of the season is captured brilliantly.  On the horror front, it's ok, but if horror in general is what you're after, you might have better luck with another movie.  Many of the scares in this movie were not especially scary.  There were some good, atmospheric creepy bits, but nothing that gave me the sorts of cold chills or jump starts the way some other movies do.  In compensation, however, there is a lot of very dark humor, and Dougherty pulls no punches in delivering the comeuppance to the characters who break the traditional rules.

3908593,3,B002CYIR34,"I had high hopes for this film after seeing the ad for it a while back. Let's face it, Halloween and horror movies have been so cookie cutter lately.  Months passed and I even forgot the name but put a post on Facebook about it to see if anyone could help me out after mentioning just a few brief scenes I remembered from the ad.  They did!  I committed it to memory and anxiously awaited for it to arrive from Netflix after a ""long wait.""  Even my local rental store couldn't keep it in stock!  Finally, it arrived and I immediately watched it that night.

First, I should have known that at 1 hour and 22 minutes, this film was going to be lacking.  As others have pointed out, the story has a ""Creep Show"" feel to it in that it is actually a series of 4 (even 5 if you count the opening scene) shorter stories that are all nicely linked together on Halloween night and each are wrapped up in a matter of 15 to 20 minutes.  The problem is that the viewer is never told the underlying theme behind these stories, albeit they are based on the traditions that you should give out candy, wear a costume, play tricks on people, and never blow out a jack-o-lantern before Midnight. The movie also begins and ends with a ""comic book"" feel to it showing cartoon drawings taken from the movie and storyboard but these effects really serve no purpose to the film other than being an introduction/ending.  The movie never leads on that this is based on a book or involves a book, although a book has since been released as a tie-in.

And speaking of Creep Show, this movie is not very original in that it definitely borrows from other horror films including Creep Show, Pumpkinhead, Scream, Jeepers Creepers, and Pet Semetary to name a few. Horror fans will definitely recognize some of the scenes and gags that were taken from other movies. The pacing of the film is nice and the way each individual story ties into the other is nicely done as well.  It's a very colorful film which also makes it very appealing, and a few of the ""scary"" scenes are great for a scare or laugh.  If you have a short attention span, then you'll definitely like the film because like I said, each story is wrapped up quickly and completely with no holes in a matter of minutes.

Overall, I think the film could have been much better had a little more depth and attention been given to each story to allow them to play out a bit more and keep the viewer guessing.  It's quite obvious why this movie never made it to the big screen, which is too bad.  The appeal is there, but it just seems rushed.",1256169600,8,2568,4.343096234309623
3908594,5,B002CYIR34,"I have been waiting for such a long time for that one Halloween film that captured the true spirit of Halloween night and that would stay with me long after the film ended (in a good way). Growing up I was fortunate enough to watch just about every horror film that has come out in the last 25 years. Never did I come across a film that captured the spirit and look of Halloween the way this film did without having to dump on brutal and unnecessary death scenes to make up for lack of storyline and detail. The director has really put his heart into this adding so much detail, sharing his vision of what he thinks halloween should be, which he makes clear he wanted this film to have the perfect atmosphere,aside from its great script and story. From the dark neighborhood street's lined with great old oak trees, to the old spooky homes decorated with glowing jack-o-lanterns,ghoulish monsters,falling leaves and children wearing homemade colorful costumes chanting trick r treat! Even the party at the center of the town was so elaborately overdone in a good way, I couldn't help but wonder if towns actually did that sort of thing and if so where are they?! One story has a memorable scene that involves a bus load of kids,that unknowingly will be meeting an early demise well wearing these awesome vintage masks that I once wore as a kid. And lets not forget the rules! All those rules we were told as kids to follow or else. How genious for the director to base his story off of those simple rules that some times we fail to neglect, i.e. check your candy before eating it(I know I never did), never blow out a jack-o-lantern until Halloween is over(its to light the way for all the lost souls wondering about in the darkness looking for the passage to the Otherworld.), etc. The characters were all played well and believable by mostly unknown stars. The three known stars(Anna Paquin,Brian Cox,Dylan Baker),were actually so played down, I didn't at all forget about any of the others which in most cases is totally the opposite. Now for the stories: The best story in my opinion, has to be with Anna Paquin's red riding hood character. I was thinking the whole time, it was funny how she stars in True Blood(I am a big fan),which is about vampires and now she is involved in another vampire story? I thought guess she's a sucker for suckers. But of course, I was surprised by a really great twist, not to worry I will not spoil for you. But it was done well, the song choice was very effective for the final scene and the make up and effects were above average.
Each story was very original and cohesive(not a plot hole for miles), easy to follow and had its own elements of creepiness and dark humor. The ""Sam"" character is one of the most ghoulish creature creations I've seen in any recent horror films. I know I will be seeing alot of the little guy running around this Halloween. In a way I am glad it was not widely released in the theaters. I have a strong feeling many people or should I say ""main stream"" movie goers would maybe not have appreciated this little gem of a film, expecting more than what has been offered and not appreciating it for what it truly is, a film about Halloween. The subtlety to it balanced the film well, it was a perfect blend of horror/dark comedy and good story telling that I felt didn't need to go so far over the top to be as successful in telling the 4 interwoven stories. I will watch this film every Halloween and whenever I feel like visiting this devilish little town. I have to mention the orginal Halloween and some of the sequals(4,5,H20)including the remake's did a great job also capturing the spirit of Halloween and will always be on my favorite Halloween horror list. Trick r Treat has done justice to this day and I have to say its my new official Halloween movie.
Enjoy friends and Trick r Treat!",1256169600,4,3862,4.4950213371266

3908597,5,B002CYIR34,"In one typical American town that goes all out on Halloween, the night holds a series of fascinating tales all witnessed by a mysterious, lone trick-or-treater named Sam in a rather off-putting costume. First, we meet a young couple that doesn't see eye to eye on the importance of this annual night of frolic. Then, a school principal with homicidal tendencies and a talent for tainting candy gets in over his head. Next, a group of trick-or-treaters visit the site of a true urban legend, and things naturally get out of hand. After that, we discover that being a virgin doesn't always mean what you think it means on Halloween night, especially if you're dressed as Red Riding Hood. And finally, the creepy, cranky old Scrooge of Halloween gets his comeuppance. It's all beautifully interwoven and tied together by writer, director, and some now might say ""Master of Horror"", Michael Dougherty.

I know a lot of people would argue about that last comment. ""Trick 'r Treat"" isn't a very gory film, it's not ""disturbing"", even if it has its scary/creepiness to be sure, but it still falls under the horror genre and is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. This is a near perfect Halloween-themed horror film. So much more perfect than any of those so-called Halloween horror films that aren't even about the holiday all that much. ""Trick 'r Treat"" is all about the traditions and memories of an all-American Halloween night! Not in a History Channel kind of way, but in that it is actually about trick or treating, carving jack o' lanterns, wearing costumes, eating candy, and all that stuff that makes Halloween one of the two greatest holidays known to man! So, what does this film lack? Well, I still am waiting for a great horror film (or, if you would prefer, ""scary movie"") about Halloween that features a classic Halloween witch. You know, the creepy old lady in the spooky house on the block that secretly looks like the Wicked Witch of the West and snatches and eats kids, rides a broom, and so on? ""Hocus Pocus"" did a great job with it in comedy and Jim Henson's ""The Witches"" is an excellent step in the right direction, but only shows like ""Tales from the Darkside"" have touched upon the subject the way that I mean in horror. Nevertheless, ""Trick 'r Treat"" is a masterpiece anyway; a truly near-perfect Halloween movie for the horror genre. Perfect if you haven't been waiting for that witch angle for years like I have, but, hey, this one has sexy werewolves! And, frankly, I LOVE horror anthologies! They are the best, and all of Trick 'r Treat's stories are winners! Oh, and the effects are almost entirely real rather than CGI! How great is that?! Sorry, but CGI just doesn't work in horror. Trick 'r Treat is just beautiful to look at too. For a horror film. It's the spirit of 20th/21st century Halloween caught on film! And maybe Mr. Dougherty could work that witch story in for a sequel?

The Blu-Ray for Trick 'r Treat holds some wonderful treats too. Besides a fun commentary with Dougherty and Co., there's a great behind the scenes featurette that also discusses the traditions of Halloween themselves. Deleted scenes with optional commentary are also included, and commentary is also offered for the best bonus feature of all, the original animated short that inspired ""Trick 'r Treat"", ""Season's Greetings"", introducing little Sam himself on his own trick or treating adventure! Also included is a School Bus FX Comparison and some BD Live features (but I never bother to use those), and a coaster, *ahem*, I mean digital copy (I prefer BD/DVD combos to DVD/Digi-Copy combos). The movie, naturally, looks gorgeous on Blu-Ray, and if you love Halloween (or just Anna Paquin), this is sure to become an annual tradition for you, so pick up a copy ASAP! I can't recommend it enough, and for me it joins the ranks of ""Hocus Pocus"", ""The Worst Witch"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", and ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" as annual must see favorites! It's too bad this film got delayed so long and then was downgraded to a direct to video release! I had been waiting for it forever and bought it right away, and I'm so glad I did! I really do hope we get a sequel eventually, IF it's from Dougherty and not someone completely different. Now, I just need to get that really cool Sam action figure!",1256083200,4,4305,4.723404255319149

3908599,3,B002CYIR34,"Perhaps I was taken in by all the hype and the (currently) 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but this movie felt like a let-down to me. It wasn't horrible but I never got into any of the Halloween stories that make up the 80-some minute running time. There's not a lot of blood or gore but then I always preferred the creepy horror movies to the gory ones. The atmosphere on this movie just didn't work for me. I was never really pulled in. Maybe the film would have worked better if it concentrated on one story (such as Sam or the zombie children coming back for revenge or even the scrooge-like old man getting his comeupance). Everything moved along so fast that I never felt any real tension or really cared what happened to the main characters. Sam's real face under the mask was underwhelming also when they could have done something really cool or (even better) kept it hidden from the audience the whole time.

There were some cool scenes but not enough and none of them were long enough for me. I liked how Sam's body was filled with pumpkin seeds instead of blood and flesh and I liked how Brian Cox's character finds all the jack-o-lanterns in his back yard suddenly. These things weren't enough to raise up the movie to something special. As another viewer said, it would have been nice to see some background on Sam or even the school principal who plays such a central role in several stories. Much like Phantom Menace, this one feels like a wasted opportunity. I'll probably watch it again if it comes on TV but I don't think I'll rent it again.

I just wanted more. Maybe there was more material that ended up on the cutting room floor. I wouldn't be surprised. It looks like I'll be sticking to Sleepy Hallow as my Halloween viewing material every year.",1255996800,4,1775,4.492260061919505

Trick 'r Treat breaks all the rules, and not only is a fantastic movie, but destined to be a classic that should be dusted off every year and enjoyed over and over again.

Plot-wise, it is essentially an anthology.  Multiple mini-stories all take place in a single neighborhood on the big 10-31.  Old legends are retold and re-envisioned with perfection and everything about it is professional. From the camera work to the acting to the fantastic film score, this is as good if not better than anything a Carpenter or Craven could come up with.

3908602,5,B002CYIR34,"Ah, ""Trick 'R Treat,"" where have you been these last two years? On October 2nd, 2009, Michael Dougherty's directorial debut ""Trick 'R Treat"" was finally released after two years of the trailer popping up on DVD's like ""300"" and ""Watchmen Director's Cut."" I was riveted right from the retro intro and the ""Creepshow"" like vibe I got from it. It's been a long time since I saw a good, fun horror film. Okay, I saw Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me to Hell"" and that was great too but I digress.

Michael Dougherty, best known as co-screenwriter with Dan Harris on Bryan Singer's ""X2"" and ""Superman Returns,"" (the later of which I had some issues with but that's for another time) has crafted an amzingly rich, and visually stunning Halloween feast of a film. Based on his 1996 short ""Seasons Greetings,"" that introduced the world to Sam (short for Samhain) a pint sized trick or treater in pink footsie pajamas and a burlap sack with buttons for eyes and a stitched smile, ""Trick 'R Treat"" dares you not to have fun on Halloween. And that's what makes this film so special. It's not just a horror flick, it's a Halloween flick. The film is practically oozing with macabre holiday spirit. Not surprisingly Singer produced this film, and I'm sure he had a hand in getting the acotrs on board.

The film is basically four stories that occur over the course of one Halloween night in a sleepy little town where they really take Halloween seriously. Starring, Dylan Baker (Spiderman 2&3), Anna Paquin (X-men Series, True Blood), and Brian Cox (X2, Troy), each story intersects with the other at some point in the story, but is told in a mostly linear fashion. SO we don't get the Taratino school of anthology, jumping back and forth with titles for each scene. What we do get is some rather interesting stories of: A principal that teaches a boy a lesson about the true meaning Halloween, while also engaging in some possibly homicidal tendencies; A young woman looking to make her first time a special one, but is stalked by a hooded man; Four kids out Trick or treating go to the site of a horrible town legend and find out legends usually spring from the truth; And an old man who could be called the Scrooge of Halloween gets a visit from someone wanting to show him the holiday spirit, and they aren't three ghosts showing him his past. The actors all did great jobs, and you could tell they were having fun. Brian Cox is perfectly surly Mr. Kreeg, and Dylan Baker just embodies both the principal and murderous aspects of his characters with such ease it's atually kind of scary. I mean if they don't do the Lizard in Spiderman 4 it's just a waste of his talent. Anna Paquin is well Anna Paquin. Good actress, but she's pretty much playing Rogue/Sookie. You know the shy, but likeable cutie. The acting is defintiely topnotch and only over the top when it should be.

All of this could be your run of the mill Horror stuff, but the way it's executed is what makes the film so much fun. Throughout the movie you are constantly following three stories and the characters within, but since it's all one night, and it's such a small little town, the characters keep reappearing in each others stories. You'll see the same trick or treaters throughout the film, the same partygoers and so on and so forth, and thrrough it all there's Sam. Sam is a blast and he doesn't even say anything. He's sort of just there and people seem to think he's just a normal kid (albeit with one wierd costume and big head) and that fact alone lends to the fun of the film. If you see Sam it's not a good thing. The movie had a few twists and suprises I didn't see coming, and that's saying alot because for the most part horror movies are predictable. This one however gets it right. It points you in one direction and takes you in another in some cases.

But I have to give special notice to the visuals in this movie. Never have I seen Halloween displayed so wonderfully on film. Jack O' Lanterns adorn front yards and fences, costumes from the goofy robot suit made of boxes, to the sexy Disney Princess dresses (yeah I said it and so will you) are all shown in beautiful lighting and detail. The scene where Rhonda (one of the children from the urban legend story) comes out of her house in her homemade witch costume with the yard full of Jack O' Lanterns could have been a poster for the film itself. Bottomline this movie IS Halloween and should be a part of your collection and Halloween tradition from now on. Seriously I'm still confused why this didn't get a theatrical release around Halloween. It would've gotten such good reviews and done really well. The hell with Saw VI, if you need your Halloween horror fix this year, save your money and go buy ""Trick 'R Treat."" You won't be sorry.",1255996800,9,4764,4.516801853997682
3908603,4,B002CYIR34,"The story behind Trick 'r Treat is almost as interesting as the movie itself.  After being filmed in 2007, it was shelved by Warner Bros.  Over the past two years, it's been shown at a variety of horror-themed festivals and other genre conventions.  Fans in those specific circles have heard about this film for the last two years, just like with another recently released horror film (Paranormal Activity).  Unlike Paranormal Activity, on the surface it's hard to figure out exactly why it was shelved.  It had some A-list help, with Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects) acting as producer and writer/director Michael Dougherty (writer of X-Men and Superman Returns) taking the helm.  Then there's the acting talent, which has both some well known actors (Brian Cox, Anna Paquin), some lesser known but still recognizable talent (Dylan Baker, Leslie Bibb) and then the oddball that some fans will recognize (like Tahmoh Penikett, AKA Helo from Battlestar Galactica).  And yet, shelved it was...until now where it was dumped straight to DVD/Blu Ray.  So...was the wait worth it?

I've heard Trick 'r Treat compared to anthology films like Tales from the Darkside and Creepshow.  That comparison is apt, especially when you see the opening credits with their EC horror comic-inspired design and setup.  Also like those films and the comics, the characters are broadly drawn and lack much in the way of character development.  After all, when you're cramming four stories into less than 90 minutes, character development is an easy victim to time constraints.  Also, like those comics, characters meet grisly, oftentimes ironic and just demises.  However, I think Trick 'r Treat has even more in common with films like Go, in which the stories overlap, intersect and involve a specific set of characters.

The four stories involve a principal who thinks Halloween is a great time for manslaughter, a small troup of tweens whose joke involving an urban legend goes too far, a very smart and inventive take on the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale and a final story involving an old hermit who gets more than he bargained for with a little trick 'r treatin' devil.  Like Go, the stories are told out of order, with the time moving forward and back to suit the story.  Each of these stories takes place in the same town, on Halloween night where everyone is celebrating the horror.  Each story takes a page from Halloween traditions: wearing costumes to blend in, checking candy, not blowing out the jack-o-lantern, etc.  At the center of the story, and serving as another connector is the character of Sam, the little kid-like character you see plastered on all of the DVDs and posters.  Sam is a devilish character who flits through each story and his importance is probably easily guessed because of his name.  The ways the stories feed into and inspire each other is interesting and I love the pacing of the film.  I've watched it twice and the second time I had much greater appreciation for the way in which Michael Dougherty foreshadowed certain events and how he tied everything together.

And while I was amazed at how intricately plotted it actually was, I was surprised because Trick 'r Treat isn't necessarily a scary film.  There's no real ""BOO!"" moments and the violence, considering the ""R"" rating and other recent horror films, isn't too bad.  It's just a fun, smartly written and expertly filmed horror film that was a robbed a theatrical viewing.  It's quickly become a go-to horror film that I will probably watch, year after year, around Halloween.  Definitely recommend it to fill your Halloween movie-watching.",1255996800,3,3630,4.976782752902156

Then Festivals started to get to see the film the actual film version. also during this period i was going out of my mind looking for the poster. I ate up every little bit of information i could dig up on this Stunning Production.
Why we were cheated out of a national release is shameful. Bad Studio,Bad.

When my copy showed up sooner than the expected date i was like a kid on xmass morning.
I was glued to the TV for every single moment of this film. it started off as a bang and just kept going.
i also missed some of the interlocking(not sure if that's the word i want) so when i read what i had kinda missed with the 1st viewing i will be looking at it differently this next viewing.

It was so much more than I could have hoped for, any trailers or teasers did not give anything away NOT by a long shot.

Be aware of reading critics reviews they may just give too much away and take that discovery away.

Again Shame on the Studio for no national release, i hope someday the actual film version makes it's way to Dallas.

The best money you will spend.

The first tale is about a principle (Dylan Baker) is actually a murderer who wants to hide his secret from his neighbors as he has been murdering trick or treaters, a lovely young woman (Anna Paquin) who dresses up as Red Riding Hood is stalked by a mysterious figure as she has a secret of her own, four teenagers with a idiot savant decide to make a terrible prank on her that soon becomes what they bargain for and finally a cranky modern named Mr. Keeg (Brian Cox) who gets terrorized by a Halloween imp creature until he has to have Halloween spirit.

Brilliant and ingenious horror comedy anthology from writer-director Michael Dougherty and producer Brian Singer is one of the most anticipated horror movies of the decade since 2007 and it's arrived. It was based on an animated short featuring the main creature then was turned into a big screen anthology about the holiday Halloween itself, there's tons of gorgeous girls with imaginative and bloody tales of horror and comedy all combined. I also love how this uses less CGI with more old school make-up effects, this one even has terrific acting and a great sense of fun that i heartly recommend to every fan of the genre.

This 2-Disc Blu-Ray has impressive picture and sound that is very theatrical quality with nice extras like audio commentary, a featurette, additional scenes, school bus FX comparisons and more exlusive stuff on BD-Live, a must have for horror fans.

Lo, my excitement was quickly reduced to groaning at my TV for 75 minutes whilst subjected to a viewing of TRICK 'R TREAT.  Not scary, nor funny, I was unsure what this flick was trying to be.  Nothing fresh was offered in this outing, just a mainstream horror mishmash of PULP FICTION, JEEPERS CREEPERS, TROLL (for bad make-up), and Playboy's ""Women of Lycanthropy"" issue.  I am sorry to even mention PULP FICTION, as a magazine reviewer did in the trailer for this trash, for any link to TARANTINO's movie should be abolished.  There was just a lack of cleverness in this outing.  Bad writing , direction, and worst of all make-up effects (wait till you see what's under the burlap sack covering the 'sinister' kid's head who stalks BRIAN COX, laughable), all of which veer this film into a no man's land of genre boredom.

3908618,3,B002CYIR34,"To say this is the best Halloween film in 30 years might be the truth since there aren't many movies about Halloween itself that are any good. With that said, Trick r Treat is a decent movie and nicely filmed. The movies problem is that it is not very scary. If you stripped away the sexual content from the film and a few blood scenes like a severed head, it could be a TV movie for a younger audience. I expected better from this since there was a lot of talk about it, but I was disappointed. Fifteen year old girls might scream at the lame and predictable hooks the film deleivers, but veterans of horror movies like me will be let down. Tom C.",1255478400,6,648,4.192
3908619,4,B002CYIR34,"TRICK 'R TREAT is one of those rare horror films these days: no pretensions, no aims to be anything greater than it is.  It isn't nearly as original as everyone is giving it credit for (has no one seen CREEPSHOW?), and is full of homages to various other horror films, but that's all part of the fun: a sort of ""name that movie"" game, filled with gore, laughs, and some pretty solid acting (especially from Brian Cox and Dylan Baker, the latter of whom is grossly under-used).

There's no real plot; the movie is a bit more episodic, with three or four loosely-intertwined stories concerning Halloween, with a somewhat central figure: a little kid in a canvas mask (who's never really explained, and that is definitely one of the film's flaws; we are supposed to identify with this mysterious figure, but we never really do, because he just seems to be an angry little hellion).  The special effects range from the genuinely good to the awesomely cheap (intentionally, I might add).  Michael Dougherty knows what he wants from his film, and he delivers.  TRICK 'R TREAT isn't all that scary, and it isn't all that original either, but it's certainly a breath of fresh air in this day and age of somewhat-PC horror flicks.  Here is a film that revels in the supernatural and absurd, who proudly boasts of its CREEPSHOW-EC Comics origins; no psychological analysis, no claims to social reform.  Just good old-fashioned Halloween horror.  Maybe, these days, that IS unique.  Whatever the case, TRICK 'R TREAT is a must see for everyone who has lost hope in the horror genre.  Here's proof that all is not lost.  (P.S. The DVD includes the animated short ""Season's Greetings,"" which started it all.)",1255478400,4,1695,4.77054794520548
3908620,5,B002CYIR34,"After seeing the amazing trailer and reading all the glowing reviews, I was all set to buy this.  Then I read the bad reviews and decided maybe I should rent it first...and now I wish I'd put the $5 rental fee toward purchasing it, because this is a GREAT Halloween movie.

First, let's consider what constitutes a Halloween movie.  It's a matter of opinion, but for me it's a movie that is either about Halloween or takes place on Halloween.  Beyond that, everything else is just a horror movie (though I do pull out the classic monster movies for Halloween...e.g. vampires, werewolves, zombies, witches, etc.).  So through that lens, there really aren't many true Halloween movies that are any good, and even fewer that are also horror movies.  There are some great kids' movies (""Hocus Pocus,"" ""Monster House,"" Tim Burton's stop-motion collection), but until now John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was really about it.

Then along comes ""Trick 'r Treat"" and the Halloween movie may never be the same!  It is true to its title in every way.  A treat for anyone who loves Halloween, and quite a trick because this is basically a kids' movie for adults.  It tells the kind of scary stories that kids would tell each other (like ""Better stay away from old lady Jensen's house...she's eaten three kids but never been caught!""), but adults usually shy away from telling stories where kids are as likely to be victims as the grown-ups.  Not so with ""Trick 'r Treat.""  Anyone and everyone is fair game, but it's done in a playful urban legend kind of way.  The content itself might be disturbing, but it's presented in a way that's no more offensive than the stories your big brother told you when you were 8 to try and scare you.

The overlapping timelines of the four stories (five if you count the opening sequence) and the shifts back and forth to different points in the evening works great...though I confess I've been trying to figure out how the four stories line up and for the life of me I can't seem to get the Halloween School Bus Massacre to fit.  But ultimately that hardly matters.  Putting all the pieces together that interlink the stories is part of the fun.  And that's really what this movie is.  It's not terribly scary, not terribly gory.  It is a little creepy, oozes Halloween atmosphere, and ultimately is just a lot of fun.

*** SPOILER ALERT --- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, SKIP TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH ***

Every story plays on the four rules of Halloween:  1) Wear a costume, 2) never blow out a jack-o-lantern before midnight, 3) hand out treats, and 4) always check your candy!

The opening sequence with the woman who hates Halloween is excellent and starts the movie with a bang.  My wife and I laughed because the couple seemed to embody everybody we know, including us.  Husbands tend to love Halloween, wives not as much.  My wife puts up with my Halloween shenanigans, but I can tell you she won't be blowing out any Jack-o-lanterns before midnight after what Sam (the trick-or-treater on the cover) did to the woman in the movie!

The Principle Wilkins story is probably the most disturbing with the most blood (or was that chocolate spewing out of Charlie's mouth?), gore, piles of dead kids and, of course, his serial-killer-in-training son.  But Dylan Baker plays the part perfectly.  He's demented, yet very casual about it.  And funny.  Michael Dougherty does a great job directing to make us feel okay with laughing at this guy when in any other movie we might have been too revolted to laugh.  And it doesn't hurt that Wilkins ultimately gets what he deserves at the hands of the werewolves.  But junior's waiting in the wings, sitting on his front porch dressed like his daddy, complete with bloody shirt and glasses!

The Wilkins story line overlaps most with the story of Laurie (Anna Paquin) and the girls trolling for dates, ultimately looking for the guy who will be Laurie's ""first.""  The least engaging of the stories, but still fun to witness the hunted becoming the hunter.

I've read complaints that the Halloween School Bus Massacre was the least realistic and the least sensitive of the stories because how could 8 sets of parents all decide to murder their mentally challenged children?  A horrifying prospect to be sure, and highly unlikely in the real world, but once you've suspended disbelief for the rest of the movie, this wasn't such a leap.  This story of a practical joke gone wrong is adequately creepy though fairly predictable.  The high point is Rhonda, the idiot savant channeling Velma from the Scooby-doo movies.  She's a hoot and I hope we see her in a sequel one day.

Finally, we have the story of Mr. Kreeg, the school bus driver who was to kill the 8 kids from the previous story so many years ago.  Played perfectly by the wonderful Brian Cox, he's now a crotchety old man who chases away trick-or-treaters with his costumed dog and steals their candy.  And little Sam's not too happy about that!  The fact that Sam was played by a child makes everything about him that much more creepy as he stalks Kreeg through his house.  I was a little disappointed the first viewing when Kreeg pulled off Sam's mask and we saw that he was sort of a skull-faced pumpkin demon (actually, he's the embodiment of Halloween, aka Samhain).  It felt a little too B-movie, but after subsequent viewings he's growing on me, though he'll always be most effective in his mask.

*** END SPOILERS ***

So final word is this is an excellent Halloween movie (though arguably not as strong if you judge it purely as a horror movie).  But if you love Halloween, no movie to date has embodied the essence of the holiday for adults as well as ""Trick 'r Treat.""  Highly recommended!",1255478400,5,5722,4.678678678678678
3908621,3,B002CYIR34,"Before I waste too much of your time let me say that ""Trick'r Treat"" is a middling film in most regards yet enjoyable as a Halloween treat.  It's not particularly scary for hardened horror fans, you won't be surprised too often if you're paying attention and you might not be satisfied with the way things end up.  If you're still interested then let's carve this one up.

-LIKE PULP FICTION WITHOUT THE INDULGENT DIALOGUE
So it's a bunch of unrelated characters that are intertwined by a convoluted, common thread.  There are plenty of time jumps and ample characters to make note of but ""T'r T"" isn't too challenging.  There's the thread with a group of ridiculously hot women who have an unnatural love for Halloween tradition.  There are plenty of clues towards the outcome of this one so don't be surprised if you're not surprised. There's also a legend of the school bus full of demented kids who are chained to their seats and dumped into a flooded quarry at the request of their parents.  Of course, the entire town chooses to look the other way.  It doesn't take long to figure out where this is going.  Then there is the principal of the local school who catches the local trouble maker causing mischief.  This little thread might be the most interesting and twisted of the bunch.  Finally there's the principal's shut-in next-door neighbor who doesn't participate in the holiday.  This thread might be the most ludicrous yet inventive of the bunch and was a bit surprising.  There are mini-threads that hold parts together but none of these stories would stick together without the ""Halloween police"".

-THE HALLOWEEN POLICE
Somewhere through the centuries and millennia someone decided that the traditions of Halloween needed policing.  Enter the indestructible little burlap-headed dude named ""Sam"" on the cover of the DVD.  He meanders through the film making sure pumpkins stay lit until midnight, candy is distributed fairly and the dead are honored.  If these simple rules are violated...  well, need I say more?  This character was invented by Writer/Director Michael Dougherty for a short cartoon he animated in 1996 called ""Seasons Greeting"".  This film is included on the DVD and is, in fact, the only extra feature on this disc.  It's pretty okay.  I hope this character is never reprised because I'm no fan of indestructible horror characters.

-PERSPECTIVE
You might agree that the worst thing anyone could do when deciding if they should buy a movie is read the glowing remarks quoted on the cover.  ""The best Halloween film of the last Thirty years"" might be stretching things just a little.  Okay, actually a lot.  I enjoyed Trick'r Treat for its gruesome giggles.  But without trying, I could probably think of 20 horror films made in the last 30 years that I'd rather see.  I'd probably think of more if I tried.  ""The Best Horror Anthology in YEARS!"" is not too much of a stretch since there haven't been many horror anthologies ""in years"".  Technically this isn't an anthology though it feels like one.  Still at the top of my horror anthology list is ""Creep Show"".

-STORY FIRST.  CHARACTERS SECOND.
The stories are okay.  To me, this is the most crucial aspect of a film, so this film is okay.  To bump things up a notch, the characters had better be interesting and well acted.  I have to give this another ""Okay"".  Most of the characters were conventional and unremarkable yet capably portrayed.  Even the shut-in played by Brian Cox was just ordinary.  The one person that stands out clearly is Dylan Baker's Principal.  I won't elaborate too much but he's the one that surprised me, convinced me and kept me interested.

-ALWAYS CHECK THE CANDY
Consider this tidbit checked.  If you're a seasoned horror fan you should be able to digest ""Trick'r Treat"" without much trouble.  You might even get a few chuckles out of it since it is a bit cheeky.  However, if you're looking for something really new, scary, gory and full of nudity then this might give you heartburn (though there are just a little of these ingredients).  Either way, it's better than a razor blade.

3908622,5,B002CYIR34,"What can I say that hasn't already been said, this movie truly captures the spirit of Halloween!  Usually when I read good reviews of a movie, I have to half believe them but this movie truly fits the bill.

I am not going to spoil this movie by going into detail about the plot or stories but I will say that it is a very different anthology movie.  This has been compared to Creepshow and some of the other anthologies out there but I have to say it's not like them at all.  What makes this movie so unique is that it tells multiple stories but wraps them all together into a complete film.  It's almost just like 1 story about a small town and the different things that happen to different people on 1 Halloween night!  It's a very creative way to tell different stories without having the usual campfire setting and then the stories are spun from someone narrating them.

The other great part of this movie is just about everything else, it truly captures the goings on during a Halloween night as well as gives a little of the real history of Halloween.  I would say this is the movie every Halloween lover (like myself) has always been waiting for.  It gives the viewer a chance to really get into some of the roots of Halloween and even some of the rules that you need to abide by on Halloween night.

It's a morality tale in parts but it also reveals a true love of the season.  This is a must see for every Halloween fan (I'm not talking about Michael Myers Halloween, I'm talking about the holiday).

My only complaint and I'm not going to drop my rating because of this, but the DVD absolutely contains very little extras, actually there is no behind the scenes on this disc at all.  You basically get a cartoon short that the director directed in 1996 for an MTV contest and then a commentary about that and that's it.  A few bonuses would have been nice but then again that might take away from the whole mystique of the film.  I loved it and you will too!  I'll tell you one thing though, I'll make sure to leave my pumpkin lit on Halloween night.",1255478400,3,2061,4.314285714285714
3908623,4,B002CYIR34,"I just got done watching this, and I thought it was great. It was just a fun movie to watch. It wasn't to scary (all though it did have its moments) it was more suspencefull and unsettling/disturbing at times, cause alot of stuff has to do with children. The different stories tie in well and will definitely warrant a second viewing because I'm sure I'll pick up some things I missed. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I wish it had been longer with more developed characters. A couple of these stories could be made into full length movies in my opinion; and because of that I felt like I needed more story from them. But they do a good job getting the point across in the time they have so this is a minor complaint. So if you're thinking of getting this, go for it, this is a great watch.",1255392000,3,793,4.223684210526316
3908624,4,B002CYIR34,"I'm not sure if this is the best Halloween movie in 30 years, but there is not much here not to like (how anyone could give it one star is beyond me). Excellent pacing, rarely a dull moment, and it is shot in a style you'd expect to find in the cinema. The acting is beyond what you'd get in an average slasher movie, and the variety makes this film a treat. You get fangs, deadly children, demented neighbors, and curious little imp that appears in each of the stories.

Aside from the comic book comparison, I find little in common with Creepshow, and it has more intensity and less black humor than Tales from the Crypt. Each of the four tales in the story are unique, though with a common theme, and occur in the same town on Halloween night. The stories are seamless and at times interweave with each other, making for a satisfying, if not fairly hurried, conclusion. It's a town with a secret, and the journey through its frightening underbelly is a treat.",1255392000,5,962,4.435028248587571
3908625,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick r Treat is one of the most original horror movies I've seen in so long! I was very surprised. It wasn't scary (in my opinion), but Sam carried that cute, creepy vibe, which I loved and always seems to add points in horror movies. I also enjoyed how all the stores seemed to slightly overlap each other in the end and you just giggled to yourself thinking ""I know what they just did"".

In short, this movie isn't for those horror fanatics that love the scare, because, in truth, I don't think Trick r Treat delivered in that department. If you're the horror fanatic that enjoys a good, funny, and very original take on Halloween and its mischeif, then Trick r Treat is the movie for you!",1255392000,9,692,4.40625
3908626,2,B002CYIR34,"Look people, here some five star horror movies:  Dawn of the Dead.  Jaws.  The Exorcist.  The Evil Dead.  Halloween.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Want to argue that ""Trick 'R Treat"" is as good as any of those movies?  Yeah, I didn't think so.

Seriously, I want to find all of the people who gave this movie five stars and kick them in the crotch.  I read all of your breathless reviews and looked at the large number of ""five stars"" and based on that decided to spend a Thursday evening watching ""Trick 'R Treat"".  What a waste of time.

I've seen some bad horror movies, and its not like this is the worst of the bunch.  The problem with the movie is that it tries to do this Creepshow/Pulp Fiction thing where there are bunch of little stories going on that sort of overlap in a clever way.  Only the overlaps aren't especially clever and even worse the little stories just aren't that interesting.  Credit for trying to do something different and creative, but unfortunately the resulting movie just isn't that compelling.

Anyway, I don't really care enough about this movie to trash it.  And if you enjoyed it, then that's ok with me too.  I'm just really ticked off that so many people decided to write these five star reviews.  Its a real disservice to people who read this website and look for recommendations.

If you love Tales from the Crypt, Creepshow, Twlight Zone, old EC comics or just a horror fan, and a little dark edgy comedy, see this one!! Why it never got a theatrical release beats me.

It's 4 stories all taking place on Halloween, all interwoven together, the atmosphere was just right, film makers going no holds barred here, the soundtrack top notch, really gets you in the mood, the opening prologue starts it off very nicely with nice opening credits. The actors are all top notch, who doesn't like Dylan Baker, such a great character actor, and Anna Paquin, so lovely in this, and her story is great. And the wonderful Brian Cox, having fun in this as a cantankerous old man who has a past. Oh yeah this is from co writer of X Men 2 and Bryan Singer producing.  The cinema-photography was great, beautiful art direction, colors just great, I did not have one single issue with this Blu Ray DVD, it is flawless!!

With Halloween all about tricks, treats, myths... this movie represents it all, has the tricks, has the treats and certainly goes into mythology, you'll see when one story goes into an old legend.

I cannot praise this movie enough... Great pop corn flick to watch on a chilly October Night, certainly get's you in the mood for this Halloween!!",1255305600,9,1402,4.573705179282869

3908631,4,B002CYIR34,"Horror anthologies can be real hit or miss.  Most often they are a miss.  It's been about 27 years since we saw Creepshow hit the streets, and finally, someone came along and made a movie that reaches for the lofty heights of the Romero/King classic.

Unlike other horror anthologies, the film avoids having a central narrator, and instead of framing it with, say people trapped in a building forced to listen to a man tell them tales, (often morality tales involving the persons trapped) the framing device is a small town.  The stories are occuring within the confines of the town, slightly intertwines as some characters will wander through other stories.  You see events from one side, then later find out what was actually happening.  The one other unifying factor is Sam, a simultaneously cute and creepy little trick or treater, who usually just appears briefly in each tale (except one where he plays a central role).

The cast is great, and and give strong, entertaining performances.  Michael Dougherty has shown himself to be very skilled as a director as well as a screenwriter.  The stories are out of sequence, but it is not as confusing as that might sound...the end of the film gives the viewer that nice little ""A-ha moment"" as you figure out the order of the tales.

It's not really terrifying, but it is not, I suspect, meant to be.  It gives you honest ""jump scares"" often combined with dark humor (Just note the Dylan Baker sequence).  This movie is an ode to Halloween and all that makes it a fun holiday.  It's a *fun* and scary movie, worth watching.  I can also say that repeat viewings are rewarding as you start to notice little things going on in the background.  I suspect this film will be the most enjoyable to watch with groups of friends, and I see this as a definite winner for a yearly viewing around the holidays.",1255305600,6,1849,4.6461538461538465
3908632,3,B002CYIR34,"Trick or Treat is a decent movie. I say that, in terms of the crap thats out there right now, which is supposed to scare us. The movie doesnt take itself to seriously, and is a fun treat for Halloween. That being said, the movie is Not great, but lighthearted ( yes, you will see what I mean later), and is defintley not scary, but at least manages to Normally intertwine 3 stories that occur on Halloween night. The stories of 3 fun party girls out on the town and 1 supposed party pooper, a diabolical prinicpal of a school, and some trickertreaters looking to scare an outcast are all standard Halloween stories, and as far as shockers go  in this movie there is only one. It is a goodie, and turns every  Halloween female myth on its head, but otherwise this film flows swimingly along tying together loose Halloween ends. Its a good choice if you want a decent Halloween movie, and while it doesnt  really tell the viewer anything that we don't already know ( and haven't seen 30 times before), at least this Halloween we can be thankful, that theres no masked gunman running around and killing big breasted girls while they come out of the shower... you will have to get a little further into Trick or Treat for that .. =)",1255305600,3,1228,4.424778761061947
3908633,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick r Treat is AWESOME!! I loved every part of the movie including the four stories that tied into the one movie. If you like a great horror movie that isn't over the top with gore and sex and nudity then this movie is for you. Granted there is some gore and nuditiy in the movie but it isn't overly done like most horror movies these days. I thought the acting was great and the stories were great as well.

The four stories involved are:
-A legend about a bus running off of a cliff carrying ""different"" kids""
-A father that teaches a bully a huge trick or treat lesson
-Little red riding hood
-Something lurking in the shadows who's name is Sam
*Sorry but I don't want to give too much away so that is why the story descriptions are so vague*

There are a lot of great twists in this movie that keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. As others have said it reminds me of tales from the crypt.

Trick R Treat is definetely ALL about Halloween which is great because you do not see too many films like that anymore. This movie also includes cults, warewolves, and vampires which makes it all the better.

This movie is definetely a favorite of mine already and I hope it becomes a favorite of yours as well.

Then I saw the preview again when I bought ""300"" when it was released on DVD. Needless to say, I anticipated the release of this movie, like a kid waits to open gifts on Christmas!
Having said all that, this movie exceeded my expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's a fun original story told in an anthology style that has not been done in horror in a long time. Not since ""Creep Show"", ""Tales From The Dark Side"", and ""The Night Gallery"", have I had so much fun watching a horror movie. I'm an 80's baby, and have become jaded by the so-called horror movies that have been released because they are either lame a$$ re-makes, or some movie that is too much like one I watched as a child (not very original).
This movie has 4 interwoven stories that are all fun and dark in their own way. Not one story takes away from another. There aren't a bunch of special effects to make up for having a lack of story line. There is one scene that has some pretty cool special effects, but it was totally needed.
I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but I will say this. There is a story about a school principle/dad who carves ""special"" pumpkins with his son,a new twist on the Red Riding Hood story, a couple that gets a special treat because the wife ""hates"" halloween, some young teens who like practicle jokes, and an old man who's past comes to haunt him in a major way.....

3908641,4,B002CYIR34,"Everyone has something they like the most about Halloween, whether it be dressing up, the free candy, or the rush one gets from the frights. For me, it's the Halloween movies, and over the years, it's been harder to find new selections that really catch the feeling of a true Halloween movie. Trick R Treat, thankfully, is one of the few.
  What makes this a good Halloween film? It's a word that is heard in the film itself: tradition. This film isn't about a group of horny teenagers running from a crazy guy in a mask. It's all and everything to do with the tradition that comes with Halloween.
  The film is a collection of ""ghost stories"" that all happen to take place on the same night. Each one crosses another at some point within the film, and each one definitely hands over the tricks AND the treats. A principal who holds dark secrets, a group of young women being stalked by a masked man, a group of children visiting the grounds on which a massacre occurred, and a man who is visited by a ghoul. Sounds generic, but in reality, none of them are. There is a twist to each and every story that makes this film quite memorable.
  There is solid acting all around from this ensemble cast. The scares feel very organic, not forced and campy. The way each line is delivered adds multiple layers of curiosity to all the crazy things seen in this movie. The film score is fitting, not memorable, but very fitting to the movie. Great directing tips off a great atmosphere to accompany and reinforce what is already a uniquely written fright.
  As said, it's the theme of tradition that holds this film up. Its a reminder that it's not ""knowing"" what is out there, it's ""not knowing"" that makes this an effective Halloween film. It's not knowing what just happened, not knowing the motivation behind it all. That's what a lot of horror films lack, or rather, should lack. It's the mystery that makes it truly frightening.
  This movie is on DVD and Blu-Ray right now, and I recommend it to everyone who loves this holiday. A warning, this is rated R, and is recommended for those at least 17 years old, not that I can stop you from enjoying it.",1255219200,5,2147,4.482051282051282
3908642,5,B002CYIR34,"I watched this movie yesterday and was not sure what to expect.  I am really glad to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  I had wanted to see this film for so long and had doubts about it when it didn't get a release.  But I have learned over the years that sometimes a movie doesn't get a theatrical becasue the studio is unsure how to put it out there as oppose to being just bad.  I really think this film is an example of that.
This film really touches upon topics that may make the audience feel uncomfortable.  Theames that studios may view as taboo.

**VAGUE MINOR SPOILERS** (These are really for the people who have seen the movie and help me make my point about the film)

Think of the Jack-O-Latern that is being carved, by father and son, in the basement.  Think of who was in the bus when it went off the cliff.

**END OF SPOILERS**

These are not ideas that the studio usually gets behind.  And, that makes it a scarey film for the studios to market.
  Also,  the way the film is edited is kind of uncommon for horror films.  It is structured like Pulp Fiction.  A group of stories that are really sort of morphed into one huge story and plays with time structure.  Again not a safe formula for the studios to get behind when putting out a horror film.  A genre that has depended on a stale formula for decades
  All in all I really liked this movie and I hope more people will see it.  I highly suggest this film as it has become a new Halloween film favorite of mine.",1255219200,7,1485,4.195035460992908
3908643,4,B002CYIR34,"I'm glad to finally have the opportunity to watch Trick r Treat. As most horror fans know, WB pulled the movie from release 2 years ago for reasons unknown, but I'm glad they finally got the good sense to release it to the public. As a DVD, is is lacking a bit. There is only one extra feature on the disc, an animated short called Season's Greetings. Apparently the Blu Ray has all the extras.

As for the film itself, it perfectly accomplished what it set out to do. It is a finely crafted tribute to the season of Halloween, and every single frame is jam packed with Halloweern atmosphere. This is the perfect DVD to pop into the player and watch on a chilly October evening while you kick back with a bowl of candy and the wind howls at your windows. I strongly recommend it.",1255219200,10,779,4.299319727891157

It's basically 4 stories all interwined ala Quentin Tarentino. While focusing on one, you'll catch glimpses of the others and in that way fill in some intentional narrative gaps. It flowed smoothly. It had a beautiful look to it. It really had a Halloween vibe from the the first shot onward. There were homages to many past classics including Halloween, The Thing, Alien, and Evil Dead to name a few. Anna Paquin now hugely popular in ""True Blood"" is part of an actually decent cast that also includes Brian Cox(Bourne Films). It was a treat to see a fresh perspective on the horror genre that hasn't been done to death. Check this one out.",1255219200,6,744,4.477941176470588

There was suspense, surprise twists, and just a fantastically creepy Halloween vibe. Most anthology horror films I have seen - ""Creepshow"" for example - have a charming goofiness. ""Trick 'r Treat"" uses some similar techniques, but it never really feels like a comic book/cartoon. There is a great humor throughout even during the most intense scenes. The connections between the four different stories are revealed quite nicely. I have only watched the film twice, but I did not notice any obvious holes or story line flaws. I think I'll actually watch it again tonight!

If you are a true fan of horror - and of Halloween - I really think you'll enjoy this one! Incredibly well done!",1255219200,10,810,4.664335664335664

The film was clever and with the interwoven stories playing out perfectly, the end was just as exciting as the beginning.
Also, the beginning of the movie black and white scene is a great touch, brings back childhood memories of Halloween that have passed..
This movie has it all, great characters, Sam, Rhonda, ghost, werewolves, vampires and many others. Good actors make this movie a success!

3908651,1,B002CYIR34,"Wow, do not let any of these good reviews fool you into watching this lame movie.  There is a reason that this did not come out in the theaters.  Stop for second and think.  Think of all the really crappy horror movies that have actually been RELEASED in the theaters.  Remember how the were not any good?  Now, try to think of a good reason why this was not released yet the movie is still good.

The acting is horrible.  However, I do not know if anyone could do good acting with such a ridiculously bad, and downright dumb, script.  This movie tries to thread four stories into one movie except it rushes them all and none of them end satisfactorily.  Each of the four parts is really like a dumb gag that never gets finished.  Not even very good gags mind you.  I could go on and on about how bad this movie was but you get the point.

Trick R Treat?  If you watch this you are surely not getting the treat you are getting tricked!

p.s.  I can almost guarantee that these good reviews are fakes planted by the company that released this movie.  Don't be a sucker!",1255219200,10,1068,4.2388059701492535

3908653,2,B002CYIR34,"I've been waiting for this movie since I heard about it 2 years ago. I've read probably around 30 reviews of nothing but praise and worship for this film, almost to the point of absurdity. Can a movie really be this good?? 100% on Rotten Tomatoes??? Seriously???  I'm a HUGE horror fan, and most definitely a huge fan of all things Halloween, so how could I go wrong reading feedback like that? So, like a fool, I believed the hype and dropped my $30 site unseen on the Blu-ray disc. Well, I guess I watched a different version of Trick R Treat than 99% of the people who reviewed this movie on the net, because I'll probably never ever watch it again. It is not even close to being one of the ""best horror movies ever"". Trick R Treat plays out like a movie version of the ""Goosebumps"" tween horror series. In fact, if it wasn't for the extremely brief nudity, and a few F bombs, this film would've just been rated PG-13. Yeah, this movie is kinda like CREEPSHOW, only CREEPSHOW is like 100 times BETTER! Seriously, if so many people loved this flick as much as they did, then I guess maybe I just don't know what a good horror film is anymore. And apparently neither do the 7 friends that watched it with me.",1255219200,5,1209,4.325991189427313
3908654,4,B002CYIR34,"Well, the long awaited Trick 'r Treat is finally available for all to see. I remember reading about this movie back in 2007 and after two Halloweens went by without it being released, I wondered if I would ever get a chance to watch it. It was hard not to get caught up in the hype. I read many reviews by people who had seen it at horror festivals and claimed it was not only the best Halloween movie ever made, but the only one to catch the true spirit of the holiday. After watching it last night, I would have to agree that the atmosphere is second to none. You have the streets littered with ghosts on posts, jack-o'-lantern's glowing with evil smirks at every turn, kids scurrying about in search of candy and just about every other Halloween tradition on display. The four stories are told out of order and they jump around like Pulp Fiction, but it's never hard to follow. I wish they would make more horror anthologies like this one and the original Creepshow. On the negative side, it was way too short at only 77 minutes. I wasn't ready for it to end when it did.

All the acting was good. Anna ""Sookie"" Paquin and Brian Cox are the big names here. I have to mention the mascot of the film, Sam, because he is such a wicked looking and neat little creation. He pops up in all the stories and even plays a big part in the final one.

Did Trick 'r Treat live up to the hype? Yes and no. It gave me exactly what I expected and it was rather unique in terms of storytelling, but I wasn't as blown away as some of the reviews I read seemed to suggest. If you are reading this and haven't gotten caught up in the hype over the last couple of years, I envy you. In any case, all the reviewers giving this thing one or two stars don't know a good thing when they see it.

I just watched this film tonight and I can safely state that all the web hype was quite well deserved. This film really delivers; chock full of mood, atmosphere, suspense, quality writing and tons of Halloween spirit and dressing throughout. Make no mistake, this film is dark and spiteful, yet tastefully done without a being a bloodbath. This DVD has earned 'must see annually' status every October 31st for me.

I understand giving this movie low ratings, there is alot going on at once and it'd be hard to keep track. I couldn't give it a low rating because there is alot of cool stuff happening thru out the film and it eventually ties up at the end of the movie.

3908662,3,B002CYIR34,"***SPOILERS*** follow, so if you haven't seen it yet... BEWARE!  ***SPOILERS***

I so wanted to love this movie.  I'm one of those people who waited 2 long years for it to finally get a release and really admired the trailer.  Every time I watched it, the Halloween season vibe I got from it was awesome.

Now, I knew going into this from reading reviews that there was going to be plenty of children getting snuffed out in nasty ways throughout the film (the reason why it didn't get released theatrically).  I didn't think I'd mind, but I actually found it a bit off-putting.  Especially when the Principal was burying one kid he'd just poisoned and another kid in the pit wakes up and fights for his/her life.  Just couldn't go with the attempted humor there, sorry.  Also, the Principal's psycho-killer-in-training kid didn't work for me. I found the whole carving a child's decapitated head with good 'ol Dad scene lame.

The back-story to The Halloween School Bus Massacre was a real stretch to me.  ALL the parents of those mentally disabled kids didn't love ANY of them? And wanted them ALL killed?  Ludicrous to say the least.  I know, movie fantasy and all, but again I had a twinge of dismay for the choice made by the screenwriter.

The werewolf sisters and their pack of werewolf friends was a bit of a hoot, but I'd seen those transformations and puppetry before.  ""Ginger Snaps"" and ""American Werewolf in London"" come to mind.  I was expecting more innovation, darnit.

Sam was a bit disturbing, until his mask came off.  A bit too ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" looking to me and not at all scary.  HATE that the DVD cover shows his big pumpkin noggin' up front, too.  Ruined any suspense on what was lurking beneath that burlap sack.  If the sack had remained on, I would have been more creeped out with all his scenes.

All in all, not a bad movie, but definitely not one I will be watching every Halloween, if ever again.  Didn't reach classic status for me.  The trailer was much better to me as can be the case with many well-edited trailers.  The cinematographer captured a few beautiful Halloween night shots, but in the end it just wasn't scary enough or funny enough for me.  Oh, and it is always a bad sign when movie makers seem to add bare breasts and the f-word just to assure an R rating.  Gore and horror should have been used to more effect to garner that badge of horror movie honor.",1255046400,6,2414,4.553488372093023
3908663,4,B002CYIR34,"The Festivities of All Hallows Eve have originated from ancient times and these days, it just so happens that it is now a yearly tradition when people can dress up in costumes, kids can have lots of candy and watch a marathon of horror movies on TV. Halloween can be so cool, and Michael Dougherty adapts his short story ""Season's Greetings"" in ""TRICK R TREAT""; it is the best movie to pay homage to Halloween. The film is the medicine for all the stupid Hollywood horror films that gets released for reasons I cannot imagine and it is the showpiece that provides genre fans a good number of laughs, scares and slight uneasiness to help bring in the 'spooky' festivities. It has been promoted as the ""best horror movie of the year"" and I may just agree. (well, this isn't really hard to accomplish really considering the horror garbage that gets released each Halloween)

Halloween is a traditional and colossal event in a small town in Ohio; the neighborhoods are all made up with flamboyant decorations to honor the festivities, there is a party in the town square and kids everywhere are `sugarified' with all the `trick or treat' spirit. All Hallows Eve also brings out the evil unfortunately; ""The Principal""-the local school principal, Steven (Dylan Baker) goes about his questionable deeds in the cover of night; ""The Halloween School Bus Massacre Revisited""- a group of kids are on a hunt for ""Jack O'Lanterns"" to test a local legend that tells the horrible tale of mentally challenged kids that was driven down a lake by a bus driver; ""The Surprise Party""- a virginal girl named Laurie (Anna Paquin, X-Men) heads out to town to look for romance and sex while her friends entertain the local boys in the woods; ""Meet Sam""- an old recluse named Kreeg (Brian Cox) is left alone to fight for his life against a creepy costumed sack-covered devil.

""Trick R Treat"" preys on appetites of horror fans for the macabre and the film succeeds. The film's tone captures the elements of a comic book made in the 70's such as ""Witching Hour"" and ""Boris Karloff's Tales of Suspense"". Writer/director Michael Dougherty has blessed us with a film that could've been a sequel to ""Creepshow"" or an episode of ""Tales From the Crypt"". It has the sensibilities of the mentioned titles although it does restrain itself from the usual stylistics as the film itself is very malleable in its portrayal of its anthology immersing the screenplay in both laughs and frights with a solid execution. It does manage to sidestep expectations of campy panache and while the film does have displays of blood, it doesn't go over-the-top in its depiction of violence.  The cinematography is also very polished and fitting to its premise; nearly resembles the pages of a comic as it says ""meanwhile"", ""earlier"", and other narrations fitted in a small box. The visual effects also appear to be a blend of comic book, fairy tales and your usual horror rendering; prosthetics, mild CGI were used and all were executed to definitely match the film's tone.

I commend the filmmakers for displaying the utmost respect of the material that it carefully breaks down into an episodic style. The film is about diverse tales of ""All Hallows Eve"" traditions, urban legends that are made up of werewolves, vampires, ghouls, ghost stories, legends that channel fear, magic and even minor serial killer elements. I was impressed in the manner with which the script managed to tie everything together; as it plays on our senses that took its time that takes everything into unsullied and new genre directions. Now the film isn't your usual scary movie, as the tone and atmosphere of the film takes on a playful and impish style that is full of ""Grimm"" elements which wanders around dark and dreary spaces that almost channels a fable. It also has some cautionary elements for kids to never knock on the doors of strangers. The film finds its footing in all the spooky mood of the holidays.

I guess the film's main premise all falls upon the creepy little fellow who is dressed up in a dirty costume with a burlap sack that covers his face and in my opinion, woe unto anyone who dares to remove the sack--I kid you not! He is the main link to all of the events in the film as he shows up in every tale and proves to be the screenplay`s more powerful ingredient that pays off big time in the film's final sequence that sets a vibe full of ""Evil Dead"" sensibilities with some ""Pet Sematary"" inspired scenes and lollipop-armed fury that just gives the film its final exclamation point. I have to say, always respect tradition and it never does hurt to follow some superstitions just to be safe. It is after all ""better to be safe than sorry"".

I've read that this is Dougherty's first feature film and it has been shelved for 2 years because of the depraved character story-arc that appears to be both terrifying and oddly cordial. ""Trick R Treat"" is a grim, dark film that channels the best it has and succeeds in what it wanted to do. The direction has exhibited a very enthusiastic style for the eve of Halloween. The film has enough touches of visuals, werewolves and vampires, ghouls and ghosts play a part in the enchanting and naughty proceedings; it also has a great presentation of the essentials in trick or treating rules. The film is delightful in its playing on the audience need for an inventive, joyfully cruel and wicked horror film. ""TRICK R TREAT"" gives a great tribute to the spookiest of the yearly holidays!

Highly Recommended! [4+ Stars]

3908664,4,B002CYIR34,"While it may not be appreciated by some because of its style of horror, use of dark humour and anthology style of storytelling, this will definitely become a cult classic in years to come. Styled after the horror comics of the 50s and 60s, this is a horror anthology in the style of Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt. Its strengths lie in the way it balances suspense and humour, while telling a good, twisted story. The four tales take place in a small town in Ohio and happen within a few hours of each other on a Halloween night.

I won't go into each story because you can find them in the description. The four tales aren't told chronologically, instead the writer weaves them together using the characters and the town parade as reference points. This was a little confusing at times but it all came together at the end. I did have a few questions but I can't mention them here without ruining bits of the movie. Overall though, it was well written and beautifully shot. However, the little kid with the canvas bag mask did remind me of the boy from The Orphanage (which was also excellent).

This and Drag Me to Hell are two of the most enjoyable horror movies I've seen in years. If you liked Creepshow, Tales from the Crypt and the Evil Dead movies then you'll probably like this. It's horror that doesn't take itself too seriously but is still satisfyingly creepy.",1254960000,2,1375,4.518072289156627
3908665,5,B002CYIR34,"Maybe? I'm not a huge horror fan. In fact, I had never even heard this movie existed until about 24 hours ago and that only because it was on our Pay Per View listing. I ordered it and I'm glad I did. I expected a fairly 'modern' horror film or something similar to Leprechaun in style and substance. I was pleasantly surprised and wrong.
In fact, I have never seen a film quite like this, although I have heard it compared to Creepshow, which is an ok film, but not nearly as polished as this.
There are four stories, for the most part, and they do intertwine at certain points and the story is told in a non-linear fashion, but not hard to follow or figure out. I appreciated that the director decided to make it bloody but not overly gory, relying instead of what are essentially old fashioned scares, and not many movie makers can do that. This is a refreshing and welcome departure from most horror films I have seen in recent years.
There is an hilarious line stolen from Carpenter's The Thing. I wonder if that was intentional?

The direction, production, music, cinematography were all terrific.

It would not surprise me at all if this film becomes the new Halloween classic. I cannot imagine why they did not release this to theaters. It is far better than all of the Saw movies combined.

SPOILERS?

Were there some weak points? Only one for me, the werewolf initiation, but even that wasn't so bad but compared to the rest of this film's positives, I can't take anything away from my overall rating.
I guess the short running time could be a weakness but the movie moves at a proper pace. It is only about 78 mins without the credits.",1254960000,2,1646,4.476666666666667
3908666,5,B002CYIR34,"Two years ago or so I first caught the trailer for Trick 'r Treat, and it looked plenty interesting, so much so that I was anxiously looking forward to it.  Then October of 2007 came, and there was nothing.  Fast forward to now, and Trick 'r Treat has finally seen the light of day, and we should all be thankful that it has.  Written and directed by Superman Returns and X2 scripter Michael Dougherty, Trick 'r Treat presents a handful of interwoven tales of terror, involving a principal (Dylan Baker) with a dark hobby, a virgin (Anna Paquin) searching for that special someone, and an old man (Brian Cox) who receives a definitely uninvited guest who isn't looking for candy.  With many odes to Tales From the Crypt, Creepshow, and classic EC horror comics; Trick 'r Treat is a pure, bloody, and definitely darkly funny treat that makes no apologies for its tone, knows what it is, and is all the better for it.  If any of the aforementioned sounds enticing to you in the least, you will absolutely love Trick 'r Treat.  It's one of the most enjoyable horror flicks to come out in a while (mainstream or otherwise) and why it sat on the shelf for so long is a mystery to me, but be that as it may, Tricl 'r Treat deserves your attention wholeheartedly.",1254960000,2,1256,4.4868421052631575

3908668,3,B002CYIR34,"First off, I think this was a decent movie. I don't think the hype justifies it, but it isn't a bad flick. It did however leave me with a TON of questions... Who is the little boy (Sam I guess is his name?), what's the point of being here? Whats his purpose? Who is he? Why is he so mad? There is no back story for him, and I don't think his name is even mentioned in the entire movie, which since he appears to be the central point of this movie you would think some information would have be told about this character. Whats his connection with the ""witch"" girl, if any? Why did the lady at the first of the movie get killed by this boy, and not the old man that he was after for no apparent reason? Why was the neighbor killing kids and burying them? What was the point of the werewolves? When did the dad decide to dress like a vamp and go to the parade, and kill someone with plastic fangs? I thought he wasn't going? See where I'm going? No back story to any of it other than the Zombie kids, which was the only part that seemed to make since to me. I also wish they would have done the timeline of events in a consistent order. Though I caught on, I don't understand why it kept flashing back to something 2 segments later. Why not keep them close so that it's fresh in your mind? I don't know, I was expecting much more from this movie than what I got. Overall I was left confused. Like I said, not a bad movie, but a little back story and better order would have made the film more enjoyable for me. I do think its great that some effeort was put into this. Hopefully there will be sequels and prequels that will help me make more since of this movie.",1254960000,4,1660,4.064024390243903
3908669,4,B002CYIR34,"I just watched this movie last night and it is really good.  The only thing keeping me from giving it the full five stars is that I really didn't find it scary.  Let me clarify:  it's scary enough to have me wanting to be sure I have Halloween candy on hand and at least a jackolantern outside my front door.  It definately had a creepy feel to it and there are a couple of gasp worthy moments.  I don't want to give anything away but the reveal at the end is outstanding which then brings the movie full circle and ties everything together.  The movie is really well made and I have to agree with most that this is hands down the best halloween movie ever.  Even if it isn't ""Exorcist"" scary.

I haven't gotten a chance to watch all the bonus features but the animated short ""seasons greetings"" was awesome and the feature about halloween history is really interresting as well.",1254960000,4,879,4.382716049382716

A horror icon is born in Sam who already has his own action figure..
If you are a fan of movies that aren't intended to take themselves to seriously then this is for you..I loved it.. It is touted as Horror/Comedy so remember this before viewing~!
I have watched it twice. The Characters were cleverly thought out and the casting perfect.
A winner~!",1254960000,,724,4.846774193548387
3908672,3,B002CYIR34,"Thanks to all the online hype surrounding this film, I expected to be totally blown away by it. I expected it to be as thrilling as all the great Halloween horror classics, including Carpenter's Halloween and Hitchcock's Psycho. I expected so much more from this -- but didn't get it. Trick 'r Treat was decent as far as horror films go, and it had its good moments. But parts of it were a disappointment: The vampire scene was TOO campy; other characters were TOO silly to work with the dark humor that was attempted. Had I not been so pumped up about this ahead of time, I wouldn't have been as underwhelmed. Before I saw the film, I really wanted to give it five stars. The previews were amazing, and the online reviews and promo were a bit misleading.",1254960000,3,755,4.438848920863309
3908673,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick R Treat is not a hardcore horror movie. It is more like Goosebumps meets Creepshow. I love the cinematography in this flick. If you like adult spookhouses and haunted houses around Halloween time, then you will love the photography work in this movie. (I never seen so many carved jack o lanterns in any movie before).This film covers all the Halloween genres:  Vampire, werewolf, zombies, witches, stalkers, serial killers and poison candy. ( Who could ask for more).
  I don't know about you all- but after 30 years of boring  Michael Myers, I think Halloween needs a new twist in hollywood. The little 'Sam"" creature in the movie makes cameos in all 4 inner stories.
  This is definately a movie you will want to watch every year during the month of OCtober. This movie is destined to be a classic. Now I cant wait to purchase the graphic novel and hardcover tie in book that goes along with this movie. For $15, buying this DVD is a no brainer for all October 31 fans.",1254873600,,978,4.56
3908674,1,B002CYIR34,"Reading the reviews going into this movie I fully expected an A+ experience.  All I can do is laugh.  I don't care that this movie sat shelved for two years and was (finally!!!) released.  I don't care who the director was.  All I can do is take an objective perspective and comment on what I found to ultimately be a terrible movie.

Let's go over the basics of any good horror flick.  Have a common enemy.  Even if it's stupid.  Jason.  Freddy.  Creepy twins from The Shining.  They all got the job done.  Lets not have total randomness dropping down from nowhere.  Vampires?  Werewolves?  Zombies (I think)?  What are they doing here?  I don't care if they are the current Hollywood trend.  They just appear out of nowhere and make you wonder what is going on.  How about character development?  Even an ounce of it, so I actually care when people are getting hacked up?  No, let's make it disjointed enough so you never notice or care who is dying.  Even the ""fright"" moments are predictable and lame.  It's as if someone took every cheesy B-horror flick and dumped it into this mess.  Watch ""The Feast"" instead, at least it has the wherewithal to make fun of itself.  I've watched too many good scary movies to give ""Trick 'r Treat"" any sort of recommendation.  Sure, if you've never seen a naked breast or heard the ""f-bomb"" dropped, it's going to blow your mind.  If you're over the age of 13, however, stay far away.

List of horror flicks that I can recommend over this (off of the top of my head):  Dawn of the Dead.  Hostel.  The Hills Have Eyes.  28 Days/Weeks Later.  Bubba Ho-Tep (if you're looking for good & campy).  The Shining.  Event Horizon.  Alien series.  Predator series.  Alien vs. Predator series.  Friday the 13th series.  Nightmare on Elm Street series.  Halloween series.  Planet Terror.  It's just going to keep going, since every scary flick that comes to mind is better than this.

If you have your heart set on seeing this, I urge you to rent before you buy.  You'll thank me for it.  I was really looking forward to seeing this one and was floored by how bad it was.  Especially after reading the reviews.",1254873600,19,2138,4.519788918205805
3908675,5,B002CYIR34,"Loved this move.  The atmosphere, set designs and fantastic costumes make one really think of how Halloween is supposed to be.  The stories are all very entertaining and they intertwine in an intelligent and fun way.  This is one we will be watching at my house for many Halloweens to come.
The blu-ray looked great and the extras are top-notch.",1254873600,,345,4.716666666666667
3908676,5,B002CYIR34,"Simply, this is the best Halloween movie I have ever seen and will become a tradition alongside Charlie Brown and Halloween.  This movie is gory at the start with the candy sequence, but I have seen worse. In honestly, I think people who dislike gore films can handle this as the movie is more focused on suspenseful scares, you just might want to look away when the chunky kid eats the candy bar.

At times the film has humor and the way it plays into a circle is fun.  The filming of the movie has a vintage appearance, which made the movie even better, considering the nostalgic Trick or Treat look is always appealing. Trick r Treat's style is very artistically accomplished with costume and atmosphere.

Setting aside the really great visuals and old school, but top notch, special effects the stories were woven together in a very creepy and intense fashion.  Also, be sure to watch Seasons Greetings in the special features before the movie, it builds to the suspense, horror, and humor of this wonderful film.

Trick r Treat has four chilling tales, each of which ending in a climatic twist. Tale one regards a serial killer, tale two is about a bus of kids that were murdered and return from their watery grave, tale three is a nifty little werewolf segment showing a change from human to wolf that I hadn't seen before, and tale four is about the Halloween demon, which is the trick or treater with the sack mask.  Out of all segments it's hard to pick a favorite as each story met my standards of a nonstop thrill fest.

Highly suggested for friend gatherings and Halloween parties.",1254873600,,1593,4.604240282685512
3908677,5,B002CYIR34,"It was well worth the wait after 2 long years.

A must see and own for every horror fan.

It is an amazing and brilliant film.

It has a little something for everyone in it.

This is already an instant classic and it
will be a masterpiece of horror for all time.",1254873600,3,262,3.980769230769231
3908678,4,B002CYIR34,"Yes, yes there have been many films that take place on Halloween in the horror genre and in the children's genre, but no one that was actually about the holiday.  For some reason the only thing resembling a celebration of the holiday comes in the form of kid's cartoons.  They're cute and pandering and never really entertain Halloween for what it really is or why people like me love it so much.  Even as a child as I watched It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown, I was confused by why these annoying kids were just hanging around and eating candy.  Where's the ghouls?  The terror?  The cold breeze with something ominous hidden in the sound?  Nothing.  The closet thing we got in the horror genre to a Halloween film is John Carpenter's brilliant slash-a-thon Halloween.  Though, that film only takes place on Halloween and doesn't really have much else to do with the holdiday, though you do feel the season represented very well in the visuals(especially cool when you consider that film was shot in the summer in California).

Here we have it, after two years on the shelf, Michael Dougherty's(screenwriter of X2: X-Men United, Superman Returns) directorial debut Trick 'R Treat.  Why was this film on the Warner Bros.' shelf for two years?  Oh, wait, it's not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or a prequel to a remake!  No CW stars to be found in the cast.  It's not a polished and glossed up slasher film with a 'hip' top 20 BLI soundtrack either.  It's a rated R film with children being treated EQUALLY to the adults when the night's gruesome fates are dished out.  Also, the structure is similar to Pulp Fiction in that it centers on one town and characters that intersect at some point or another.  Some in crucial ways and others not so much.  Time is also played with.  The film moves back and forward in time every story.  You'd have to be a complete moron to be confused by the fact that some characters killed in the first half show up alive in the third, but then again, after listening to the Blu Ray's commentary, there were such morons--but I'll get to that later.  This is a quality horror film that revels in everything you loved about the Halloween holiday, and if you're like me, still do.  It's not cute.  It's humor is of the blackest type.  There's real danger involved and the children involved in the tales are not kept safe by the PC police that make children so precious in film they're barely recognizable as real children.  This is good stuff.  Now, it's not scary, but any horror fan worth their salt knows that horror has many facets and one of them includes black humor.  This film is more concerned with its tongue firmly being planted in its cheek then it is in created true terror or unbearable suspense.  Sure, it has some exciting and some very creepy moments but nothing substantial to the point that I would say anyone over the age of ten would be scared by it.

It's an anthology film, but the tales are intertwined, cutting back and forth to one another as the film goes on.  Unlike films of this ilk like Creepshow, Cat's Eye, or Tales From The Darkside: The Movie, there's no story that is used as a wraparound.  All the stories connect on one level or another but you won't be clear how until the final moments in most cases.  Plus, what the film is really trying to do is used these tales, there are four seperate stories, to create a mood and feeling.  A feeling that is like a love letter to what is obviously Michael Dougherty's favorite holiday.  This small town in Ohio is filled with Principal Wilkinson(Dylan Walsh), who is a stern and strict task master when it comes to the old Halloween traditions(you don't want to take candy from this guy if he catches you desecrating Jack O Lanterns).  We get a young virgin(Anna Paquin) named Laurie who is being cohersed by her friends to finally have her 'first one'.  We also get a group of young kids planning the ultimate prank on a fellow schoolmate based around the town's local tragedy and urban legend.  Finally, we get an old miser played by Brian Cox, Mr. Kriger, who hates Halloween and gets a visit by an especially nasty Trick or Treater.  These stories, even though they're all broken up and mashed together, flow perfectly.  You never once get annoyed that one story started to get good and then cuts away to another.  The edit structure of this film is tight and very well done.  Plus, it's amazing how on the second viewing you can spot certain little bits that intersect that you might have missed.  For me personally I had missed the fact that Sam got his razor blade stuffed candy bar from Principal Wilkinson's house.  There's more but you'll have to discover them for yourself, and since the film is a brisk hour and twenty seven minutes it has a high rewatchability factor.

This film nails all the tropes that are associated with Halloween old and new.  We get the twenty something girls using the holiday as an excuse to tart up and dress like whores.  There's also ghouls and other mosnters roaming around.  We get the leaves and the constantly blowing Fall winds.  There's the creepy house that all the kids are warned to stay away from.  We get the traditions and snippets of the stories behind the traditions such as trick or treating itself and lighting Jack O Laterns.  There's pranks.  There's the annoying kid who uses the holiday as an excuse to vandalize and all they want is candy to stuff their fat faces with.  Horror movies are on all TVs and classic horror films' soundtracks can be heard from TVs in the background of scenes.  It's quite a lovely love letter to the holiday I adore so much.  Oh, and we get a brand new Urban Legend in the form of a Special Education bus that meets a horrible fate.  The whole idea of it is horrible and creates some of the film's more ominous and creepy imagery later on.  The flashback to the story behind the legend is truly unsettling and well done for maximum effect.  Finally, and my personal favorite, we get a new Halloween mascot in the form of a diminutive character named Sam(short of Samhein--even though the 'm' is silent and doesn't sound like Sam, but I digress).  Sam is wearing orange footie pajamas and a sack on his head with nothing but buttons for eyes.  He carries a dirty sack an all the candy he carries within seem to be very dangerous.  We even get to see his face, and if you take the slip case off your Blu Ray disc you can check it out, so it's already fairly spoiled before I tell you about it.  Basically, Sam's face is a carved pumpkin.  Bill Terazakis(Doomsday creature effects on the last season of Smallville) is responsible for the little imp and he is a truly memorable creature character.  He's creepy and demonic but keeps a child-like wonder about him all at the same time.  An actuall child actor, as opposed to a little person, was used to perform the character and it results in a conflicting sense of terror and wonder.  He's great and I've actually had a five inch action figure of him for two years.  They've been in stores waaaaaaaay longer then the actual film.

The Blu Ray itself is pretty sweet as well.  We get Dougherty's college animation thesis film, Season's Grettings, where we are introduced to this film's physical manifestation of Halloween's spirit.  It's interesting and is a good representation of the actual film's tone.  We get some deleted scenes which really end up being extended scenes of stuff still in the film.  Most are just long versions that were eventually tightened up in the final film for better impact.  There's one really cool deleted moment between Anna Paquin and her Vampire persuer when they play a game of seduction on each other in the woods.  It's interesting but if you watch it you can tell that for technical and tonal reasons it was rightfully deleted.  We also get a 27 minute featurette that goes behind the scenes, not in any depthful way, of the film and shows how certain segments and imagery represent the traditions or origins of Halloween.  It's narrated by co-star Brian Cox and has the usual cast and creator interviews along side some Halloween scholars who very excitedly go into detail of the many origins of Halloween.  Did you know it's been around long before Christianity?  Well, I did, but it's still very interesting.  Finally, and my usual favorite, there's a commentary track featuring director Michael Dougherty, conceptual designer, editor and score writer.  Like I mentioned earlier this film was shelved for the last two years.  I can remember seeing trailers for it in the theaters back in the summer of 07.  Dougherty doesn't go on the record but he alludes to the many varied reasons behind it's shelf life.  One of them being the fact that in test screenings the film's structure actually confused people.  Hence, why there are subtitles telling the simps in the audience that this moment takes place ""Later"" and ""Earlier"".  Oh, and unshockingly enough, they objected to the violence committed against children, even though the film isn't particularly gory, and the kid deaths aren't onscreen, they just suffer from the usual moron children are precious thing.  I guess they couldn't understand a film that had such a comical tone have such real consequences for its characters even its children.  Dougherty has a great line from the commentary regarding the test screenings where he shouts, ""I don't get this film!  It's not a remake or a sequel and I don't know what's going to happen!  I want something like Friday the 13th remake where I can predict everything in seconds!  I want a sequel and a remake!""  It's really funny and really bitter(Warners handled both films).  He also goes into detail about what the original drafts of the story was like, most the changes seem to be with the Urban Legend story.  This was Dougherty's first script.  He also notes his literary and cinematic influences and promptly points out where he homages or rips them off in his own film.  It's very light hearted and funny to listen to these guys and here their behind the scenes stories.  Considering how much their film got crapped on by the studio they don't come off too bitter and all seem quite jovial, and totally appreciative that the film can be seen at all.

Bottom line, is this is not a scary or frightening film.  It's not overly gory.  It's not really that intense.  It is very creepy and very blackly funny.  Each story revolves around the theme of someone being more then what they represent, sometimes more then once in a story.  The twists in the stories aren't revolutionary and on the same level as Chinatown, but they are fun and will leave you smiling as they play out.  Don't try to be a smarty pants and prove how cool you are by being smarter then an anthology horror film.  Try just enjoying it.  This is a perfect seasonal film and I would much rather sit through this 100 times then ever watch The Great Pumpkin ever agai.",1254873600,7,10933,4.608493008803729
3908679,5,B002CYIR34,"J:  i give this movie a 10 out of 10, because it captures the whole mythology of halloween.  im just glad it's not a remake because i am sick and tired of remakes, because it ruins the classic films; i want more original ideas, but all in all, this one makes #1 in my top 10 halloween movies.  I hope a sequel for the movie is in the works, because it will be worth the wait!

B:  i also give this movie a 10 out of 10; great directing, good cast of characters, beautiful but dark atmosphere within the movie, really good punch lines and great humor, and it almost kind of stretches the basic traditions of halloween in a more theatrical version of explaining how to keep the halloween spirit alive.  i would highly reccomend this movie to anyone that has even the slightest interest in halloween, let alone horror freaks alike.

3908680,5,B002CYIR34,"I have waited two long years for this HALLOWEEN film, and I am glad that they finally released it! I loved everything about it; the cool costumes, the sweet HALLOWEEN decorations, all the jack 'o lanterns, the Marilyn Manson music, the HALLOWEEN parade and much more. The movie tells four stories that occur on this dark HALLOWEEN night. Some things happen out of order, but told again later through the perspective of another character. We meet Principal Wilkins who poisons candy. Have a 'killer' party with a beautiful woman named Laurie who will a blood feast with her sisters. Revisit the HALLOWEEN School Bus Massacre as a few kids play a nasty prank on a girl named Rhonda, but it turns out that the dead kids on the bus wanna come out and play.

But unlike Creepshow, Trick 'r Treat even ties all of the stories together in some way, shape or form by the end which is really cool.

This movie was supposed to be a theatrical release back in 2007, but got pushed back to October 2009 (for some reason that I'm too lazy to research on). The point here is that a direct to DVD release is usually spelled L-A-M-E. Trick 'r Treat is spelled G-R-E-A-T. Great for a Halloween season horror movie anyway.

Trick 'r Treat is scary. It's funny. It's deliberately over the top. And X-men 2 writer Michael Dougherty directs the movie with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-1-2/dp/B0000C826X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;Director Bryan Singer overseeing the production. Pretty good recipe for a quality movie if you ask me. And they don't disappoint.

In a small town in Ohio, folks celebrate Halloween with much enthusiasm. But Halloween apparently has rules. Follow them...or else. Similar to movie's like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B000068DBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>&nbsp;the first scene of the movie is actually occurring later in time than some of the following scenes, and the following scenes occur simultaneously...or not. No matter, four stories of horror and mayhem are then woven together that'll have you laughing, squirming and jumping out of your chair.

The acting is very good. As I said earlier, when it's over the top...it's on purpose. Anna Paquin even makes a pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood/dp/B001FB4W16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood</a>&nbsp;appearance in Trick 'r Treat. Maybe it's this movie that got her True Blood character so into vampires?

Guaranteed to scare kids, Trick 'r Treat earns its R rating with some of the gross-outs. A snip and an edit here or there could easily have gotten Trick 'r Treat a PG-13, but I'm glad the release stayed true to the way it was filmed. The Blu Ray version even includes the deleted scenes in the extras (I hear that the standard DVD does not so beware).

3908682,5,B002CYIR34,"Almost perfect....the reason it isn't? NOT LONG ENOUGH. I wanted more!

Heard about this movie 2 months ago from the internet. Researched about it and watched a trailer for it. The trailer had me sold. I'm an addicted horror fan! I have seen em all (give or take) from tame to lame and utterly appalling to cheesy. I've seen horror like the classics...Chainsaw massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. Seen the remakes. Seen low budget,foreign horror, and twisted horror like Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox, and all the video nasties. So I know horror movies like an alcoholic knows liquor!

Bought this movie yesterday and when I got home from work I couldn't wait to watch it! It was awesome! I hate to read up on all the hype on movies because I hate the letdown. I was hoping this wasn't gonna happen and it didn't! I was NOT dissapointed at all. I just wish the movie was a half hour longer because i didn't want the fun to end. This movie is a must BUY...not rent...Buy. It""s all Halloween from start to finish....pumpkins, trick r treating, and scares from the first minute to the last!

I own almost 4,000 movies, and 600 TV box sets, and I buy most of them used so that I can get them for under $10. I wanted to see this one so badly that I did not even want to wait to get it shipped by Amazon - I ran into Best Buy on the first day it was available, and even though it was only 12:30, I got the last copy they had. I got home and watched the film (not as good as I had expected based on the prior reviews, but not bad - as mentioned before, it's sort of a cross between ""Creepshow"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" with a bunch of cameos form genre veterans including Tamoh Penikett from ""Dollhouse"" and ""BSG"" and Britt McKillup from ""Dead Like Me.""). Then I went to check out the extras. All I got was a short ninety second cartoon from 1996. I was not all that surprised, given the shoddy treatment of this film that they hadn't produced any extras. But then I went on-line, and discovered that there are the usual deleted scenes, director's commentary, and making of featurette - but ON THE BLUE RAY ONLY! Give me a freaking break Warner Brothers!!!!!!!! I could understand not wanting to do a 2-disc release for this, but the movie was only an hour and fifteen minutes long! There is NO EXCUSE for not including the extras on this disc. It's a slap on the face to the fans who have waited 2 years for this. My advice - if you want to see this movie, wait for it to come to cable. You won't be missing anything. And if you did waste your money on this disc,  please write to Warner to express how annoyed you are at them. I personally will not be buying any more Warner Brothers movies for awhile - and I try to buy almost every horror movie that comes out. WARNER BROTHERS - I HATE YOU!!!!",1254873600,19,1868,4.117808219178082
3908684,4,B002CYIR34,"Picked this one up last night and rushed home....feverishly...to watch it.  I'd been waiting, like many, for over 2 years to lay my eyes on this one.  And after all was said and done...

It was good....not great, but good.  I think this is probably me, I'll admit, having a vivid imagination, I spent a long time building this movie up in my mind.  My expectations were high....maybe alittle TOO high.

The stories themselves are solid, and the interweaving they do of the stories was also done well.  The sets, actors and actresses(the old man(Brian Cox) and principal were the best, that, I expected). I liked Lisa Loeb(insert sarcasm)as the savant witch girl, who had a pumpkin carving fetish. Honestly though, she was my favorite character. The character of Sam was really pretty cool...although he looked like Pumpkinhead Jr.  Seriously, the sculpt of his head looked identical to the creature Ed Harley dug up(and the witch would later bury again).  Either way it was effective, and it looked good.

So why 4, not 5 stars?  Well.....it seems that this film is being toted as the best Halloween flick in, what, 30 years?  This is, as I recall, one of the ONLY films centering on Halloween that was done in that time(that was worth anything).  The only other thing I can think of that was worth anything in that time that centered on Halloween was a Tales From the Darkside episode, called Trick or Treat(I believe).  It wasn't a feature length film, I know, but it was probably the only other decent material to come out with Halloween as the central theme(I don't count the Halloween sequels..eewww, except maybe Halloween 2).

All in all, definitely worth seeing if you're into the genre.  Does it redefine it?  No, not really.  Is it the best Halloween themed film in 30 years?  Yeah, maybe, but as I said, that ain't saying much, as there wasn't all that much that was noteworthy.  But check it out...it is alot of fun.  Look at it this way, once you're done watching ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" with the kid(s) if applicable, and they're off to bed, this will probably be on the short list of things to watch celebrating the season.",1254873600,3,2154,4.690666666666667
3908685,4,B002CYIR34,"I really enjoyed Trick 'r Treat.  I only wanted to see it because I saw Anna Paquin was in it, and the tag line is pretty cool/creepy: ""Poison, Drowning, Claw, Or Knife. So Many Ways To Take A Life.""  I had no idea what this film was about (pertaining to plot), but I did not care; Halloween is my favorite day of the year.  I love horror movies.  So why not give this a try.

I was surprised how disturbing the storyline was, although not graphic or gratuitous at all.  It is a dark movie about one Halloween night, and what happens to people in this Midwestern town obsessed with this special night.  Urban legends, scary noises, rules to live by, and the typical pseudo-sexual Halloween elements of real life and Hollywood films converge in a believable setting.  The non-linear narrative is great for developing these characters and stories with extra chills.  I would not call it scary or gruesome (visually), but it is definitely on the dark side.  And there is also some black humor as well, which is always a staple of any horror movie.  Sam was my favorite: burlap head and orange footie pajamas.

If you like Halloween, and all the legends and frights it entails, then you will like this film.  If you want Saw or something visually graphic, look elsewhere.  Like I said before, I love horror movies, and this one has become my quintessential Halloween (sorry Michael Myers!).  Recommended.",1254873600,3,1400,4.6571428571428575
3908686,5,B002CYIR34,I was very excited to get this DVD after reading the reviews.  I'm really tired of the Halloween movies that come out and are all gore and that's it!  There is scary and there is just plain gross.  This movie was a wonderful treat because although there is gross (as should be in a horror film) there is a well thought out story to follow.  Even my husband loved the movie and he NEVER watches horror movies with me anymore.  Loved it!,1254873600,2,435,4.2560975609756095
3908687,3,B002CYIR34,"This is a well written and well executed movie. I watched it twice just to join all the timelines together and I liked it even better on the second viewing. If I had to compare it to any modern film I would have to say it most resembles Pulp Fiction in the start at the ending and work your way back formula. Had I only one suggestion it would be to bag the comic book presentation of the film. It made me think the director or the studio didn't trust the audience enough to follow the story to the very end without some narrative direction. I really liked this film and will make it a must see every Halloween. So why would I only give it three stars if I liked it some much? It lacked any real horror moments; There was gore, blood and violence but it was never pulled together to create real tension. The foreshadowing was so telling that I was never startled or apprehensive as to what would happen next. Even with these short comings I found myself entertained not once but twice for an hour and half. No doubt this movie will become a dvd classic and when the studio decides a sequel is needed I hope they can revisit this movie with a director's cut.

While the dvd isn't feature rich, which is a drawback, the blu-ray contains enough material for multiple viewings. Included on the blu-ray version are extended and removed scenes which in my opinion clearly shows that for the moment the best cut of the movie is the feature. Also, included is the director commentary -- and it is interesting to listen to his take on what was necessary to bring this movie to the screen. You will also hear his reasoning as to  what prevented the ""suits"" from making this a theater release; something along the lines of too many kids as victims.

A couple of other features that are included is how the bus scene was completed and the original cartoon that was the idea for Sam. Fun to watch once but I doubt I will ever view those two again. Perhaps the best additional item when getting the blu-ray is the digital copy included with the purchase.

If you don't have a blu-ray player you might be better off renting this one until a special edition dvd comes out with all of the material that is found on the blu-ray. All that aside still a fun movie to watch and as tonight is Halloween I be watching this movie one more time until next season.

Happy Halloween",1254873600,8,2355,4.355353075170843
3908688,5,B002CYIR34,"Last night after watching Trick 'r Treat with some fellow horror cinephiles, I pondered on and discussed what the modern horror era might look like in twenty years.  Outstanding horror films have been made since the dawn of film but horror, unlike many other major film genres has had some long dry spells of five, ten, and even fifteen years.  Furthermore, horror has had some terrible quality work being brought forward to audiences from the very beginning.  The conclusion that came to mind was that the 1930s and 1970s are pretty much the most generative decades for the horror film, that is along with right now.  We've seen great horror films surface slowly since the early part of this decade and now it seems we see about five or six great ones among dozens of only slightly worse films, but altogether far more redeeming than those released in the 1990s, every single year.  And it took this little Halloweenie movie to really convince me that we are in the midst of a horror renaissance.

Trick r' Treat weaves several different creepy stories about zombies, serial killers, werewolves, vampires, and a miniature pumpkin monster.  It is directed and written by Michael Dougherty, whose previous screenwriting credits include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2/dp/B000AYELVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2</a>.  Dougherty is unquestionably a name to watch out for.  The film stars some notable actors like Brian Cox, Dylan Baker (re-channeling Bill Mapplewood from 1998's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happiness/dp/B00000IC7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happiness</a>), Anna Paquin, and Lauren Lee Smith, and its supporting cast no doubt holds some untapped talent, especially for its child actors like Britt McKillip and Samm Todd.  However, the films greatest strength is its style.  From the great special effects, seamless CGI enhancements, Elfman-esque soundtrack, distinct cinematography, and consistent bombardment of Halloween imagery to tie it all together, Dougherty has crafted a nearly perfect movie destined for cult-classic status.

Great horror movies are not always necessarily the films that look to scare and disturb you first and foremost, but films that tell a story that might remind you of when you were once scared of ghost stories.  Trick 'r Treat provokes many memories of Halloween past and is saturated with Jack-o-lanterns, skeletons, ghosts and costumed children and adults alike.  It is a massive celebration of that time of year, but by the same token it is still a creepy and suspenseful movie at just the right times.  It is a wonderful and careful balance that very few horror filmmakers even bother to acknowledge.

It is dreadful to hear that films like Saw VI will clean up at the box office this Halloween, while a great little film like Trick 'r Treat is left to fend for itself as a straight to DVD release.  I can only hope the masses will observe the praise and acknowledge this film's merit, and that Trick 'r Treat gets the last laugh, however unlikely that may be.  What a shame, but show business is all too often a booming business and an abysmal show.  Trick 'r Treat was made to please the horror cinephiles out there but its mass appeal is undeniably present.  It is a non-stop entertaining journey and its style is such that it has the potential to remain timeless.",1254873600,,3411,5.352059925093633
3908689,5,B002CYIR34,"I don't care what anyone else says about this movie. It is a must see, a must own, a must sleep with nestled on the pillow next to your head at night movie! I went to Best buy, target, and k-mart and they were all sold out!

I cant say too much about the movie. I don't want to give away anything that could potentially ruin it for the first time watchers shock and awe. Not only is this a great horror flick but its probably one of the better movies I have seen in two or three years. Beautifully done! Wonderful! This movie will be shelved with my Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween it deserves a thrown and a crown just as prestigious as theirs!

Kudos and bows all around make your kids watch this movie, your grandmother, your parents, invite the hobo that lives on the sidewalk in for a candy apple like grandpa used to make (ha had to use at least one line) and let him watch it! It really was an all around good time!

OH and all of you that gave it one star stay away from pumpkins.....probably for the rest of your life.",1254873600,,1051,4.142156862745098
3908690,5,B002CYIR34,"Ok, Let me start by saying I have read both positive and negative reviews on this...which is why I am posting my own opinion.

First of all a little history....WB had this complete film sitting on the shelf for a couple of years now, and just released this on DVD yesterday (October 6th 2009) in a limited store release. I still can't wrap my mind around why they did not release this in theatres at Halloween time this year since it would have been a perfect movie. I had emailed WB contacts last year, and I am sure some other eager fans waiting to see this film did the same, about releasing this in some form or another since it has been finished for 2 YEARS! Then this summer..there were previews before Friday the 13th in theatres...yet still no release of TrT...so finally we get the film, that somehow went straight to DVD (no complaints here)...That being said...

This movie overall has a perfect 80s horror film feel. I just think of the ""sucker in the mouth"" scene. It is good cheesy fun. If you are a fan of Evil Dead 2, Drag me to hell, Nightmare on Elm St, or Tales from the Crypt...then I think you will like this. The movie is not scary, but I don't recall anyone ever telling me ""this is the scariest film you will ever see""...and it isn't gorey, but I don't remember hearing that rumor either...WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID...don't watch this expecting some scary bloody massacre....you won't find it. This is most like a good creepshow with intertwined stories that end up being done very well. Visually it is pleasing and the story is pretty original. Plus you get a new face of horror with Sam (the ""kid"" on the cover)

So in conclusion. If you like 80s horror and you aren't looking to crap your pants from being scared or hide your eyes from gore...this is for you. It is entertaining and funny. I think it really is as the DVD case says ""the best Horror movie in 30 years"" (taking you back to the 80s)",1254873600,2,1922,4.393258426966292
3908691,5,B002CYIR34,"Just got done watching this movie and it was a blast. Was it scary? Not really. Were there ""jump"" moments? For other viewers who don't watch horror too much: Yes. Was it fun and refreshing to see a horror movie not take itself too seriously and just let you have fun? YES! This movie may get a few bad reviews, most likely by people who think horror should have tons of blood, swearing and nudity (there is some nudity in here but I am talking like ""Hostel"" nudity). Basically if you think movies like ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", the crappy ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake and the last two ""Screams"" were horror movies than this is not for you because this is fun, like a horror movie should be.

Remember how fun ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""Fright Night"" were to watch? Well, this is like that. Mild dark humor, good performances by great actors we all know in someway or another (such as Dylan Baker, Brian Cox and Anna Paquin) and just flat out fun to watch. And that my friend is the purpose of the flick. To have fun with the themes of October and more importantly: Halloween. What also helps make this a little fresher than most of the junk that passes as horror now is the non-linear timeline for the entire movie. Instead of moving you from one story then the next, the filmmakers relied on a way of telling all the stories at once and interacting with each other (to a subtle degree) much like you would find in ""Pulp Fiction"" or even ""The Killing"".

I will admit there are some cons. I wish the movie was longer in terms of the stories developed a bit more and the total run time (the movie clocks in at 82 minutes). I also do wish the DVD had more ""meat"" to it with extras... hopefully Warner will allow perhaps a restored director's cut or better package to be released soon.",1254787200,3,1787,4.395770392749244
3908692,5,B002CYIR34,"Where is the 10 star button?  Seriously, if you are a fan of Halloween and horror movies, this movie is for you.  I have over 700 horror movies on DVD, love them all, but this one just ranked in my top 10 list.  I hope Michael Dougherty will make many more movies.  He is going to be a legend!",1254787200,2,293,3.9152542372881354
3908693,4,B002CYIR34,"Trick 'R Treat's writer and director, Michael Dougherty, aims to suss out the origins of Halloween. He does just that but in a unique way. Instead of simply throwing the general public a history channel documentary, Dougherty gives us a fun, thrilling, colorful adaptation of Halloween's origins.

The movie centers around four different stories that are all intertwined somehow. These four stories not only link but they have twists to them that allow them to be linked together. There were times when I was watching this movie and had forgotten about some earlier characters and when they'd moved on to another story and the characters from another story showed in the current one, it was a nice surprise because I'd gotten so wrapped up in the current story and forgotten about the others.

Besides the obvious linkage, the one constant that links them all is Sam. What the hell is Sam? No one knows but he makes for an excellent, creepy Halloween antagonist. He pops up in every story (and is involved in some more than others, one in particular) and adds a feel of eeriness to each one.

The movie is an instant Halloween classic and like others before me have said, it is one of the better horror movies we've seen in a good while. Saw has gotten old, I'm over the 'based on a true story' horror flicks, and boy am I about fed up with remakes (don't get me wrong, I like some but where's originality?) so when one comes out that seeks to present the origins of a holiday that spawned all these other horror movies in a UNIQUE way, I'm all ears. Plus it helps that Dougherty wrote X-2 and the director of X-2, Bryan Singer, produced this movie. Trick 'R Treat does exactly what it wants to do and anyone who enjoys a classic horror flick without unnecessary gore and (hopefully) not 2,000 sequels, you will most certainly enjoy Trick 'R Treat.",1254787200,4,1848,4.6109422492401215
3908694,5,B002CYIR34,"(First off, I'm reviewing the blu-ray edition of the film.)

Personally, I loved this film.  Like others, I had been waiting for it for a long time and was overjoyed to finally sit down and watch it.  The Halloween season is brought to vivid life with this blu-ray.  The Autumn colors pop, the Jack-o-lanterns glow with life, and the leaves falling in a dimly lit forest add a lot of atmosphere to the film.  Overall, it looks great and sounds great.  The whispers, howls, and background music all come together nicely.  I don't have a single complaint about the look or sound of the film.

By the end of the 1 hour 22 minute runtime, everything comes together nicely and makes sense while there are some surprises to be had.  It doesn't overstay its welcome at all.  True, this film may not appeal to everyone with its dark humor/horror mixture, but if you're looking for a fun film to watch to get you in the Halloween mood, this is definitely the one.  (Side note for parents: there isn't a lot of gore in this, but there is partial nudity and some violence to children in the film.  Just to let you know...)

The extra features on the blu-ray edition are a nice addition and are as follows:

-""How Did Many of Our Scary Traditions Start"" is filled with a lot of information about the origins of Halloween with various cast and crewmembers and narrated by Brian Cox.  It was nice to see how a lot of thought went into making the film.  It's definitely informative and entertaining to watch.  The director really seemed to have a great time making it.
-""Commentary with Director Michael Dougherty""
-""Additional Scenes"" were mainly just longer shots of scenes in the film, although some things are a little different (Anna Paquin's character getting a glimpse of 'Sam' instead of the 'Man in Black', the scared kids running from the old man's house and running into the chubby kid, etc...)  I did enjoy the scenes, though.
-""School Bus FX Comparison""
-Exclusive features via BD Live

Overall, I really enjoyed watching this.  It's really a shame it wasn't released sooner.  I'm glad to finally add this to my blu-ray collection.",1254787200,,2129,4.654155495978553
3908695,4,B002CYIR34,"I'm kind of astonished after watching Trick 'r Treat. Not that it was a bad movie or that I'll spend the entire review saying what utter nonsense it was that the movie got screwed by Warner Bros. who left it on shelves for two years before releasing it to festivals then dumping it into homes. Truthfully I had heard that it was a anthology film with its own little character in Sam a tiny apparation in a burlap sack costume that pops up from time to time. I pictured Creepshow or the likes but the film in a way has more to do strangely with films like Crash in terms of storytelling. Its not episodic but more interconnected with stories bleeding over and into each other as characters inhabit their four main stories and for a horror film I found that kind of cool and smart.
Like Creepshow as well the film itself is more atuned to being more atmosphere than anything else mixing humor with gore and elements of the supernatural. I won't try to explain the stories themselves just say they explain a trio of trick or treaters who plan on playing a trick on an idiot savant, a school principal with a murderous streak, Anna Paquin dressing up and looking for a date to attend a party thrown by her sisters, and Brian Cox as a cantankerous drunk who is menaced by Sam. Of the stories I liked the one with the principal and the way it goes into Paquins. Cox is a brilliant actor who plays his scenes with Sam to the hilt in a funny bit ending a mystery brought forth in the kids episodes. And Dylan Baker as the principal is funny in a sadistic way.
The movies not the best thing ever but but it balances horror with humor perfectly and in the end was a great suprise. Warner Bros. treatment of the film is astounding given their treatment of it but hopefully it will become the cult hit it deserves to be.
Sadly as I don't have Blu-Ray I missed out on owning a version with special features. However the DVD itself is given some good audio visuals as the transfer is one of the better ones from the company of late with some nice audio to back that up. It might not have special features but everything else was done well which is good enough for me.",1254787200,3,2153,4.305418719211823
3908696,4,B002CYIR34,"this movie got so much (underground) hype, i may have been expecting too much. but i didn't care for the out-of-sequence story line, and what there was wasn't enough. i think the kids and school bus story needed more time. the old man (brian cox) storyline was kind of thin, and the anna paquin storyline was kind of pointless. maybe if each storyline had been told all the way through each story would have seemed more substantial. but, as it was, they were pretty short and didn't leave much of an impression. and the comic book ""wrap around"" elements was too much of an afterthought. it was well made and certainly better than most horror movies released. but far froma classic.",1254700800,2,681,4.636363636363637
3908697,5,B002CYIR34,"Finally. Customers had been asking about this for years now, and after screening this all weekend, I do not feel there will be any disappointment. I typically do not screen many horror films, but this was truly a treat.

Four story lines are relayed non-lineally as a town (actually a neighborhood block) experiences the most horrific Halloween night one can imagine. Admittedly, I caught a great deal more while listening to the commentary on the second viewing, but this is that kind of film - you have to watch it more than once, but it is worth every moment. You will get your scares, suspense, twisted trick-r-treating, a few critters, and some great acting by both kids and adults alike.

The Blu quality looks superb, and there are loads of opportunity for failure with the all-night shoots, candles lighting virtually every indoor scene, and the associated CGI sequences. The sound and scoring are adequate (though I would have loved to hear this in DTS). The supplements are great and include:
* 17 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary. Between this and the main commentary it is quite apparent how much of a battle it was with Warner to get this film made. *rant* Warner really stinks *rant*. Some of the best humor and darkness was eliminated - but at least we get to see it here.
* 3:45 minute animated short. Low grade little clip that shows some original inspiration for this film.
* 1 minute CGI/FX comparison of the bus sequence - forgettable.
* 27:18 minute making of/history of Halloween. Narrated by Brian Cox - well worth the watch. Good information, solid interviews and worthy background material.
* The crew commentary. Totally worth listening to all of the funny things they had to go through in making this - plus they point out every single little nuance from the background scenes. As stated earlier, you might want to watch it twice, and with this option on.

No real detractions here except for the story behind the release story with Warner. Enjoy.",1254528000,12,1992,4.801749271137027
3908698,5,B002CYIR34,"Trick R Treat is an incredibly fun movie. I read a review that summarizes this movie into one sentence: it's a hybrid of the 80's classic ""Creepshow"" (four different, stand-alone stories) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (cheeky dialogue and the different stories are interconnected with one another).

There has been a lot of hype circling this movie for the last two years, and hype can definitely lead to inevitible let-down. If you go into Trick R Treat expecting another torture porn movie (like ""Last House on the Left"" or ""Hostel"") you will probably walk away disappointed. If you want gratuitous gore and 20 minute scenes of torture and/or rape look elsewhere. Trick R Treat is classier than that and pays homage to old classics of the 70's and 80's. There's plenty of cheeky humor mixed with legitimate thrills- similar to a Sam Raimi horror movie (if you think ""Evil Dead"" is a ""fun"" horror movie than you will likely feel the same toward ""Trick R Treat"").

Most horror fans will find this movie an instant classic- it is well written (gasp- an actual PLOT!) and well acted. It's a quality movie that will only be rejected by the torture porn crowd who think over-extended scenes of human suffering is synonomous with horror.",1254355200,3,1221,4.809523809523809

What sets Trick R Treat apart from other horror films is the atmosphere, story telling and the level of fun involved. The atmosphere is creepy and yet fun it just reminds you of Halloweens past. There are four main stories in the film and they all intertwine and come together in the end. All of them are quite fun, Dylan Baker's story is the best, but even the worst isn't bad by any means.

Trick R Treat is a great film for those who want to get together with some friends and watch a fun, scary, and well told horror film.",1254268800,5,650,4.241935483870968
3908700,5,B002CYIR34,"It's been awhile since I've written a review for anything on Amazon. Still, I recently saw Trick 'r Treat and I felt it was time to say something new, so, here I am.

I'm just gonna throw it out there: Trick 'r Treat is the best horror film I've seen so far this year. It's a well crafted, original horror movie. That's saying a lot after the plethora of sequels/remakes (Saw, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc) films we've been hit over the head with lately. Going back to my title, this film is a return to form. It feels like an '80s film, but it also feels fresh. It's a horror anthology but it isn't disjointed. On top of everything, it's FUN.

I have no idea why Warner decided to shelve this film for two years. I would gladly have paid to see this in theaters multiple times. On the other hand, I've given up on the Saw franchise.

I don't want to oversell this film because, like everything, too much hype sets expectations too high. On top of that, not everyone will share my opinion. All I can say is, if you're a fan of horror, watch this film, give it a shot. If not just for the success of this film, for horror films in general. As a horror fan, I'm tired of the 8th sequel in a franchise and I'm tired of only seeing remakes in theaters. Let's get some original thrills back in the cinema.",1254268800,18,1303,4.224899598393574
3908701,5,B002CYIR34,"Halloween just happens to be one of Sid's favorite times of the year. When the cool weather starts moving in it just seems to inspire the need to watch horror films from laughable b to really great flicks, like our favorite and annually watched Halloween. One portion of horror that has always been our favorite is films comprised of shorter stories just like Creepshow 1&2 along with great t.v series like Tales from the Crypt/Darkside. There's just something great about getting to see multiple ideas within one film, which is why Trick 'r Treat was such a welcomed release.

The film is made up of four short stories all intertwined in someway all taking place in a small town. The stories are somewhat built on Halloween folklore taking a very original and creepy twist the entire way through. You'll get to enjoy a serial killer teacher, sexy werewolves, young vengeful zombies, and an extremely creepy half pint pumpkinhead. Overall a really enjoyable film which kicked off Sid's Halloween season just right. Despite a few negative reviews, we'd have to agree with most who loved it.

Great movie.
People have been talking about this on the web for two years now! Very entertaining and new to the scary Movie genre! Good story all the way through! It is like a movie in a movie in a movie. I can't believe a movie this original didnt' go over with Hollywood. It deserves better than an STD! It should have been released in theaters a week before Halloween!

The horror genre these days is nothing but remakes and SAW films so it's really refreshing to see a film this creative being released. I wish i could have seen it in theaters but a dvd/blu ray release is good enough for me. Hopefully it sells well and we get a sequel, only with proper treatment from the film studio. I don't wanna say much about the movie because i don't wanna spoil it for anyone but it's extremely fun to watch and the dark humor is spot on. If you're a fan of popcorn horror flicks then buy this immediately. It's destined to be a Halloween cult classic.",1254182400,5,731,4.228571428571429

I was looking forward to it because as you can see everyone says its the best halloween movie in a long time. Than i saw it for free on a website in perfect dvd quality i was excited cause id get to see it finally and than id still buy it.

Honestly the beginning was cheesy but i was like eh thats just the first 5 minutes. than as the movie went on i was like is this a spoof of horror movies like trying to be funny? Than at the end i was like this movie sucked worse than anything i've ever seen. I only wish it was as good as everyone else said. I've been waiting for a movie like that.

3908705,5,B002CYIR34,"As someone who grew up on 80's horror, I have been more than a little put off by the state of horror films in recent years. It seems everything falls essentially in to one of two categories. On the one hand we have these endless foreign PG- 13 remakes, that are soft on gore and lack anything else to make them compelling. If  I see one more horror flick with a scary girl with long black hair I'm going to scream. Then there's the other extreme. While many in the U.S. are up in arms (and rightfully so) about the use of water boarding and other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" employed by our government , Hollywood continues to dole out these torture porn movies that revel in human suffering. Whatever happened to monster movies? Vampires, Werewolves, Creepy ghouls, witches and good old fashioned masked stalkers?! When I first saw the trailer for Trick r Treat, let's just say I was elated. There hasn't been a Halloween themed movie in years. (I'm not counting Rob Zombie's abysmal and unnecessary Halloween remake). For reasons I still don't understand, Warner Brothers decided to hold back the release of this film for 2 years.
Finally this year it gets a straight to DVD release. I really built up a ton of anticipation for this movie and while it wasn't exactly what I had expected, it was excellent none the less. Let me make something perfectly clear. If you didn't grow up on stuff like ""Tales From The Crypt"", ""Creepshow"", ""Childs Play"",  ""Nightmare On Elm St"" etc., you will probably NOT like Trick r Treat. Go see Saw 17 or whatever. If you like old school fun and somewhat campy horror, and if you love Halloween, you will  LOVE Trick r Treat. Now this isn't ""The Shining"", There isn't a ton of character development, but it's a tight 82 minutes that's  packed with enough fun and iconic Halloween images to put you into that All Hallow's Eve mood. The stories cleverly intersect ala ""Crash"" and it takes more than one viewing to pick up on everything. It's pretty craftily put together and some things are left to interpretation. I truly  believe this will become a Halloween cult classic.  I know I will be taking it off the shelf every October. Just like I do with the ORIGINAL Halloween. So check it out.",1254096000,14,2230,4.6186868686868685
3908706,5,B002CYIR34,"At the tender age of four I sat down with my father on a dingy old sofa and unbeknownst to me, my little life was about to change forever.
With my Dad, I watched my first horror movie - The Exorcist.
I had been allowed to watch it because my father saw something in me, something that I had directly inherited from him, a deep and instant love of all things spooky.

Over the years we bonded because of this connection; he told me ghost stories instead of bedtime stories, we painted each others faces to look like skeletons- even though it was only July, he encouraged me when I said I wanted to grow up to be Elvira - because at 7 years old I honestly thought being a horror show hostess was the best gig ever, and then there were hours upon hours of Daddy/Daughter horror movie marathons.
I'm 25 now, and if I had to guess, I'd say I've seen over two hundred scary movies.

So to say ""I've always been a big fan of Halloween"" would be an understatement.

Prior to seeing this movie I had only known two things about it. 1)People seemed to really like it and 2)It was was mainly made up of various short stories, almost Creepshow style. So, naturally, I was anxious to see it.
I'm not sure how much I can actually say about the movie without giving too much away (and to be honest my love of the genre has still not made me an expert movie reviewer), but I'll try tell you some of the things I love about it; it's visually stunning - having fabulous art direction, it involves a good amount of traditional Halloween lore without ever feeling cheesy, the cast is believable, and most importantly (to me) none of the stories were predictable. Once this movie was over I almost immediately wanted to watch it again.

Up until seeing Trick 'r Treat my Halloween tradition involved a watching a whole fleet of horror/Halloween movies to help get me in the perfect frame of mind to properly celebrate my favorite holiday. To try to find the right blend of Halloween magic and mayhem - laughter and screams. This movie does just that. I'm not saying my old movie tradition over, but I AM saying this little straight-to-dvd flick, in just one viewing, has made to the elite ranks of my all time favorite horror movies.

I can't wait to tell my Dad about this one.",1254009600,19,2257,4.37708830548926
3908707,5,B002CYIR34,"I saw this movie at the Toronto After Dark film festival. As another reviewer put it, it's a love letter to Halloween. It has intelligent storytelling (so rare in modern horror films), is beautifully crafted (without an overabundance of CGI), and so much fun to watch. This will easily become a Halloween tradition in my house, and I'm sure for many others.

I can't begin to understand how a movie like this got shelved while we have to suffer through prequels, sequels and boring remakes. Hollywood believes in order for a movie to be successful, it must be unoriginal. The big wigs really dropped the ball on this one.",1250899200,20,621,4.697247706422019
3908708,5,B002CYIR34,"I caught Trick `r Treat at the Midwest premiere and was simply blown away. Like most horror fans out there, I have been following this movie since it was first announced and was anxious to see if it could live up to my expectations. And boy did it ever.

Trick `r Treat is a phenomenal movie that captures the spirit of the great `80s horror flicks. It gives us one night of interwoven stories that scare you, make you laugh, make you cry and make you cheer. All the right people get their comeuppance and the viewer is presented with a chewy moral center. The greatest offering Trick 'r Treat has is its heart and honesty. Director Michael Dougherty's passion for the genre bleeds out of the screen and into your heart. This doesn't feel like a photocopied version of what was once great, but instead an original masterpiece that ought to be studied and revered.

I walked out of this movie rejuvenated and filled with wonder. It reminded me of the first time I saw Return of the Living Dead, April Fool's Day, Dolls and so many other classics of the `80s. You see, this isn't gore porn, this isn't a remake, this wasn't originally in a foreign language and this doesn't star the WB actor of the month: THIS IS HORROR! This is a movie that speaks to fans, not one that speaks to our wallets. It speaks to you, not at you.

Now, I don't want to go into a commentary on Hollywood and the way they choose which movies we see, because ultimately, it isn't entirely their fault. We are the ones who spend the money that justifies what they make. If we keep putting money into seeing PG-13 remakes of our favorite horror films from the `80s (and in some cases `90s), it is our fault that they continue making them and watering down the horror gene pool. With the internet, fans have more power than ever to make their voices heard. If we don't fight for the types of movies we want to see, who will? Don't be bullied by Hollywood; fight back. I had never felt the need to really post reviews or opinions before; instead I would commiserate with friends about the inferior products I was being offered. Well, no longer will I passively sit by and watch the genre I love be destroyed. It is up to all of us to make a difference.

Folks, this is an instant classic.  This is going to be the one you watch every Halloween (along with Halloween).
Trick 'r Treat keeps you guessing and most of the time, you're going to be wrong.  Every so often, I'd lean over to a friend and lay out a prediction as to how a scene would play out.  I was pleasantly surprised and happy to be wrong.
It's becomes clear pretty early on that this movie doesn't pull its punches.  It's rotten to the core but also lots of fun.  You will believe these characters.  You'll be pleased at how seamless Trick `r Treat comes together.
Do yourselves and writer/director Mike Dougherty a solid--pick this up on October 6th.  Show Hollywood that this is the kind of creative output we want from the slasher and horror genres.

3908715,5,B002CYIR34,"I was lucky enough to see Trick 'R Treat in Chicago recently at the Terror in the Aisles 2 festival. Even better, the director, Michael Dougherty held a Q&A afterward. I say I was lucky because Warner Bros. has decided not to release this movie for the better part of 2 years now! Why they chose to do this is unfathomable given how great and original it is!

Trick 'R Treat stars Brian Cox, Anna Paquin and Dylan Baker along with an ensemble cast of talented unknowns. The movie is essentially an interconnected series of 4 stories (plus 1 flashback) that all take place on Halloween night in a small, quaint Ohio town. The settings are a picture-perfect imagining of everyone's best Halloween night and, more than anything, the loosely-knit stories represent the magic (good and bad) of Halloween and trick-or-treating and the traditions that must be upheld lest you risk death. It has everything you could ever ask of a great horror movie: monsters, buckets o' blood, dismemberment, evil adults, evil kids, revenge from beyond the grave, terrible people getting their come-uppance, black humor and some truly frightening moments.

This movie instantly became one of my top-5 horror favorites and I'm sure it'll become one of yours! If you are even a mild fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to see this movie! Don't let the fact that it never got a theatrical release stop you from getting the DVD or Blu-Ray-this is a truly original, truly great horror film!",1250726400,11,1464,4.782608695652174
3908716,5,B002CYIR34,"People all over the webbins have been talking about Trick r Treat for some time now - exploring conspiratorial notions on why the film has sat shelved for so long while rhapsodizing about just how well X-Men 2/Superman Returns scribe Michael Dougherty's directorial debut works.  Having recently seen the film, I can tell you that I know why the film sat for years:  It's one of the more ruthless studio-funded horror films ever made.  It's not very gory or explicit at all - but it has a truly, deeply, bad attitude.  If William Gaines penned morality plays this venomous - to hell with the Comics Code.  He'd have probably served time.  Trick r Treat is overflowing with the kind of anarchic, mean-spirited hilarity that never sits well with the suits.

One of the reasons the film feels so vile is that the people who populate the tale feel so utterly real.  It's really hard to explain without spoiling a lot of what makes it work so well, but - to give you an idea - director Michael Dougherty explained to us that one of the notes he received during the production process was that the children he cast were ""too young"".  Couldn't he make the kids older?  Couldn't he cast hotter?  That's not to say that elements of the cast aren't flat-out ""foxy"" (witness the sexi-sexi of Lauren Lee Smith and Rochelle Aytes) but there are sequences in the film that work perfectly because they're not about plasticine twentysomethings.  Again - I can't explain exactly what I mean without doing you a disservice - but when you finally see the film, you'll understand completely.

Trick r Treat has been described in certain quarters as an anthology film - but that's not wholly accurate.  In truth, the film possesses a non-linear narrative structure - it's more a Pumpkin Pulp Fiction than a Creepshow copy (though the EC Comics connection this film shares with Romero's classic make them kindred spirits - and a great double bill).  The film moves back and forth between tales that, at first, seem to be related only by the presence of the mysterious, malevolent little creature seen in the film's promotional materials.  Over the running time, we come to realize that the tiny creeper pops up for a reason - and even that detail is something I don't want to spoil for you.

Despite the aforementioned EC Comics vibe (wherein the table-turning reveal that hands the petty thief or adulterous couple their just desserts is par for the course), the twisted twistiness of Trick r Treat still manages to surprise.  At different points during the running time, the audience could be heard to speculate on how they felt some swerve might play out - very early on, I had an idea of how I thought the tale featuring Dylan Baker should end - but I was convinced that there was no way my resolution would fly.  That Dougherty was able to do exactly what common sense told me would be excised by an executive before it was ever filmed completely negated my anticipation of the last shot.  The sequence ended the only way an understanding of the horror genre dictates it should - but instead of feeling ""been there, done that"" - the payoff plays like the reward for sitting through all of the committee-created genre projects that lack the spine to do it right.  Another reveal - easily the film's most glorious - made me feel like a complete idiot.  Thinking about it now, I still don't understand why I didn't call it with a chuckle the very moment True Blood's Anna Paquin awkwardly stepped out of her fitting room to face the derision of her friends.  At least I wasn't alone - by the end of her character's arc, the audience I was part of sat in stunned silence...then burst into reverent applause - a response based on elements converging in a perfect storm: a beautifully-shot and edited sequence featuring a fantastic revelation, a flawless mix of practical and computer generated imagery, an awesome character beat - and one super-cool line of dialogue.  You could sell the film with that single scene...if it didn't give so much away.

The most brilliant thing about Dougherty's film is how it uses Halloween holiday iconography to craft iconic visuals (if the film received the 3,000 screen release it so richly deserved, really cool parents would be dressing their kids up as ""Sam"" for years).  It's Jack O' Lanterns and autumnal golds and vacuformed masks and flame retardant costumes that tie in the back and urban legends and classic monsters and tainted candy and everything else you know and love about October 31st.  As so many before me (including Dougherty himself) have said, this is not a film that takes place during Halloween - this is a film about Halloween.  It's about the reason for the season.  Dougherty says his hope was that his film could become a Halloween holiday perennial - the one you watch every year.  And trust me - it is.  I'll watch Trick r Treat every CHRISTMAS - because the film is a gift.

3908717,5,B002CYIR34,"Having been a follower of this film since it was in production, oh so many years ago, I'm ecstatic that it's finally coming to DVD and Blu-Ray!

My quest to own this film originally started with the [...] when I immediately fell in love with the handful of officially released publicity photos leaked to the site.

My interest piqued more when I got a look at the teaser poster for the film:  a childlike innocent figure with creepy undertones and all rendered in subtle black and orange hues.

Then it was the summer of 2007 and as I popped in my copy of the 2 Disc Special Edition of Zach Snyder's ""300"" I got treated to the film's trailer.  Starting off with a vintage-looking Trick or Treat Safety Film in a small 16 mm-looking frame, it had me hooked.  One of the things that makes the Halloween season endearing to me is its connection to pleasant childhood memories.  Then the music washed in and the frame expanded to a very Widescreen John Carpenter-esque Panavision shot with flickering jack o' lanterns in the corner and a Little Red Riding Hood walking through some moonlit woods... and I knew that this was the movie for me.

I realize I haven't told you much about the film, and that's on-purpose. I don't want to ruin anything for you. Don't get over-hyped:  It's not a complex film. It's simple and brilliant.  It just knows what it is. And those who know what it is, will have a great time watching it.

Just know this:
It's a love letter to Halloween.
A gorgeous homage to things that go bump in the night.
And though it's not breaking any new ground, it's the type of film whose viewing transcends generations and becomes a tradition.

If you like anthology films such as ""Creephsow,"" ""Creepshow II,"" ""Twilight Zone The Movie,"" ""Cats Eye,"" and series such as Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt... this is your movie.
It's smart enough to throw winks at those who enjoyed horror films from the 70s, 80s and 90s but original enough to take in new viewers enamored with True Blood and Twilight.  Like many good horror films such as ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""Scream"" and ""Drag Me to Hell, it takes the viewer on a ride that switches effortlessly between humor and horror.

Best of all it centers around the Halloween Season, traditions and imagery and should be watched with It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown, John Carpenter's Halloween and Garfield's Halloween Adventure, every year.  An instant classic... and I don't use those words offhandedly.

It far exceeded my expectations and I believe it to have already become a classic film for horror aficionados and lovers of the greatest holiday ever, Halloween.

The film is set up as a sort of anthology of short stories, yet they all intertwine and complement each other in the end. There is some great artwork in the tradition of Creepshow and at times reminded me of that film, but the main difference is Creepshow's stories are all their own and Trick 'r Treat follows one night with several groups and characters that each have their own encounter with a very evil character indeed. The film has lots of suspense, violence, gore, and some sexy nudity in one story involving werewolves. We also have a serial killer principal, some rotten teens trying to scare a nerdy girl, and a story told that is destined to be some type of urban legend in the future involving mentally disabled kids and a disastrous fate. The greatest thing about Trick 'r Treat is its style and campy flavor that truly stuck to the evil side of the tracks. The film was so much fun to watch and destined to be a genre classic.

It's too bad that an original idea comes to Hollywood and and they respond by not giving it a release in theaters and snubbing it. I was very lucky to see it in a theater at all.
