8185647,5,B000OMH26O,"Although I am not a fan of Michael Thurmond's 6 Week Body Makeover Diet, I am fond of his sculpting instruction using the resistance bands.  It can be done in the privacy of your home at any time of day and you can really feel it.  You can also perform some moves using free weights and while you're watching tv or listening to music.  No gym fees or waiting for machines to become available, yet you can achieve the same desired affect (effect?)  I'm grateful to have received this barely used and for like...$2?  Crazy happy.  He is very thorough with his instruction and for some reason I just love him.  His models have a lean, tone look and are not over-the-top.",1453420800,2,667,4.418032786885246
