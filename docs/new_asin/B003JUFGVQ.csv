4131392,5,B003JUFGVQ,I watch portions of this DVD often before and after BJJ training to evaluate my own technique. The DVD set has a lot of great high percentage flow moves from Roy Dean's style and perspective which I have adopted in a lot into my style. Well worth the price. Thanks Roy!,1370476800,2,269,4.294117647058823

4131396,5,B003JUFGVQ,My husband loved this dvd. He said there were a lot of great techniques that he learned and he trains jujitsu in class 3 times a week and every day at home with his grappling dummy. He says it is excellent and Roy is a great techer,1354406400,2,231,3.9361702127659575
4131397,4,B003JUFGVQ,"I recently purchased this item and watched it right away.  First off the price is great, very hard to find a jiu jitsu dvd instructional for 40 dollars from someone who is actually reputable.  Secondly Roy Dean always has very professional and insightful instructions to his techniques.
  I have been training no gi jiu jitsu for almost 5 years and have won a couple competitions so i feel i am qualified to review this DVD.  I think No Gi Essentials is focused more towards someone who is just getting into nogi after training Gi jiu jitsu for awhile.  He addresses the fundamental holds like underhooks/overhooks head and arm control etc., and discusses some differences to expect when entering the no gi game.  After that short section he goes into techniques and setups from various positions such as guard, mount, side control, takedowns, arm drags, kimuras, and chokes.  There is also quite an extensive section on leglocks which I loved.
  Unfortunately I found very little in the way of new techniques, however with that being said, after training for a few years you will usually not see any new techniques.  As you progress it becomes less about learning new techniques and more about combining techniques you already know using tried and true set ups.
  Although I really appreciated the few new set ups I found on this DVD set, and at the price I think it was worth it.  If you are new to jiu jitsu in general or just getting started in no gi I think this is a top notch buy.  If you have been training nogi for a few years you shouldnt expect much you haven't seen but I feel that almost anyone can at least find a couple interesting things in this set.
  Something worth mentioning is his section on side control escapes.  One of my favorite parts of this DVD set, it goes over many many options that all work together and when to use them.  There were even a couple I've never seen before and thats saying something.  If I had to pick my least favorite spot to be in it'd be in someone's side control so this was a pleasant surprise for me to find some valuable techniques to add to my game.
  Also as a bonus on the DVD set there is footage of his students at a grappling tournament, a couple students qualifying for their belts and a flow roll.  Kind of neat to watch, but then again i like watching that kind of stuff.
  Bottom line:  If you are a new jiu jitsu player this DVD set is worth the money, no question.  If you are fairly advanced it is still worth the money but less so.  Im hoping in the future Roy comes out with an advanced nogi dvd, because I appreciate the insights he gives on certain positions.  If you are on the fence about whether to get it or not...just skip the donuts and coffee for a few days and get this dvd :D",1327276800,14,2757,4.393280632411067
4131398,5,B003JUFGVQ,"I'm not a big No Gi competitor, but this DVD helped me understand the difference between Gi and No Gi when it comes to approach.  The techniques are solid and as far as instructional go, Roy Dean's are always the most professional looking and easy to follow.

Another 5 stars for Roy.",1312070400,2,284,4.4423076923076925
4131399,5,B003JUFGVQ,"Since our jiu jitsu school is still developing and we don't train with a Gi, it was awesome to find a DVD series that showed us the basics and then progressed from that to show more advanced techniques.  Roy Dean does a great job of explaining as well as demonstrating exactly where your limbs need to be for the most effective results.  This is a must for anyone looking to do No Gi jiu jitsu!",1311552000,2,394,4.24

4131401,5,B003JUFGVQ,"Overall, this DVD set has a lot to teach and does so in a format that is easily understood and clear to watch. You could re watch these DVDs several times and learn new techniques or new facets of a technique each time. A very good investment.

More specifically: I thought the first section on how to move properly was a little slow, since I've been involved in martial arts for so long that being told how to roll was now to helpful, but at the same time it would be good advice for a true beginner, and even for a more advanced student, it really never hurts to be reminded of the basics. In any case, Roy rapidly moves on to techniques, which is where the DVD really shines. The techniques tend to be presented in a building sequence, which I found really intelligent as it meant that if you already knew the basic concept of a particular submission, you could still get a lot out of learning where to go next or what to do if your opponent defended against that submission, or even a more waterproof variation on that submission. All good things to know. Also, if a move was new to you, the first time watching that section you might only pick up the basic first technique (as I did with the ankle locks, for example), but then watching it again a week later, having tried that move at my academy, I was able to absorb how to move from that ankle lock into the next technique in the sequence, and then the next and the next and so forth. Roy also explains the dangers of some positions and goes over the finer details of others. All in all, there is definitely a lot to learn from these DVDs. They are NOT just some guy showing endless submissions with no explanation or cohesion.",1278374400,19,1685,4.315457413249211
8398490,4,B003JUFGVQ,The 4 stars is because amazon will not allow you to download the video if you purchased a digital version. GET THE DVD ! The instructions are clear but the video quality is in SD and not HD and it shows somewhat fuzzy. Great for viewing on a laptop but not so great for large screen tv.,1499040000,,286,4.035087719298246
8398491,5,B003JUFGVQ,Roy is an excellent teacher. He takes complex techniques and breaks them down. Makes no gi easy to learn. I wish there were a part 2.,1487203200,,133,4.153846153846154
8398492,4,B003JUFGVQ,Excellent and understandable. (Pricey for its short length duration which lowers it to 4-stars.),1483574400,,96,5.928571428571429

8398499,5,B003JUFGVQ,These are excellent dvd's which i can incorporate with the GI since i don't do NoGi. The only problem i have is with whoever ships the dvd's. I received the first time it was scratched up the dvd's were not secure and the packaging was thin which i guess thats why the case was cracked also. Anyhow Amazon replaced it but i still received scratched dvd's but not as bad but still scratched which causes the play back to pause or freeze.,1373414400,3,436,4.329268292682927
