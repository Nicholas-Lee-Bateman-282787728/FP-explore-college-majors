7905760,5,B00000A5GV,"Just adding my 'protest' alongside the other reviewers... this was one of the funniest, smartest, most well-written series on television (even today, in reruns). There really was not a single weak link in the cast. Each character had its own set of quirks that made them so interesting. Why hasn't the entire series been released by now on DVD/VHS?",1102982400,3,348,4.915254237288136
7905761,5,B00000A5GV,"Before the dawn of the 90s version of the ""ensemble"" cast, came WKRP in Cinncinati.  This series is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen and they still make me laugh even after 20 years.
The Fish Story:  One of the funniest episodes I have ever seen. The battling mascots in the bathroom still makes me roll on the floor laughing.
Who is Gordon Simms?:  A sad, but still amusing story of Venus Flytrap life.
My only complaint is that the entire show is not available on video.",995587200,8,482,4.333333333333333
