7913414,5,B00000JSIH,"I'm a huge collector of anime.  Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,428,4.283950617283951
7913415,4,B00000JSIH,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.

In this volume Tenchi and Sakuya become very close. It is clear to see that they are in love. Ayeka and the others are jealous. Ayeka hitchhikes to get to Tokyo. That becomes a really interesting experience. In the 3rd episode of this set Tenchi and Sakuya are working hard at their school's culture festival when the other chicks show up and pretty much ruin it. This is the part where Tenchi and the girls drift apart, seemingly for good. It is a very sad experience. But it is also kind of refreshing. Seeing Tenchi have feelings of true love is the biggest plus for this series.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1324,4.5125
7913416,5,B00000JSIH,"Ayeka has become paranoid about Tenchi and Sakuya.  What really seems to upset her is that nobody else seems to care.  Ryoko TRUSTS Tenchi!  As Ayeka and Sasami try to reach Tokyo Yugi arranges for them to be side-tracked by a female biker and her obsession for a super-fast male jogger.
Then Amagasaki, a friend of Tenchi, starts to become a pest, hanging around Tenchi and Sakuya way too much, so Yugi sends a spirit of a female wrestler to keep him away from them.
In the end, it's the action of the girls themselves who drive angery Tenchi into Sakuya's waiting arms.  At the carnival the two kiss, right in front of Ryoko.
This is a great DVD, really showing the changes that happen within Ryoko and allows you to almost feel the hurt she feels in those last scenes, as she watches Tenchi kiss another girl in front of a full moon.",1087603200,,836,4.409090909090909
7913417,5,B00000JSIH,"What I loved most about Volume 5 of Tenchi in Tokyo was the in-depth emotion that was portrayed throughout the episodes. It satisfied my wonder of how the situation between Tenchi and Sakuya would turn out, or at least how it seemed to turn out, and kept me on the edge of my seat at the same time. The emotion, action, and peacfully calm moments were nicely balanced out. Also, unlike some of the other Tenchi in Tokyo volumes I viewed, each episode in this volume had something special about it that set it apart from the others and contributed in an important way to the plot of the whole series. I highly recommend A New Love to any Tenchi fan or Anime fan. Enjoy!",1038614400,,668,4.352
7913418,4,B00000JSIH,"In my opinion, these three episodes are the best in this series. While the animation in Tenchi In Tokyo is not as sweet as Tenchi Muyo, i think the storyline's better. These episodes have different faces. it's funny, sad, romantic, and even makes you angry at times.
The first episode, ""Tokyo Or Bust"", is a humorous episode as Ayeka (dragging along Sasami) try to get to Tokyo to talk to Tenchi. In order to get there faster, they team up with the mysterious biker Masayo. The man she wants to be with is a very fast traveller, and Masayo is always trying to catch up to him with her bike. This episode is crazy... one of the better Tenchi episodes.
The other two episodes take place at Tenchi's school at the time of the Carnival. It centres around the relationship with Sakuya, but the Okayama gang shows up and Washu trashes the school with another one of her bizarre inventions! Tenchi and Sakuya also get much closer.
It's surprising to see anime that is this entertaining. The fun is brought out by the exaggerated physics, sparse dialogue, and obscure depictions of human love. This DVD is one to check out.",1022544000,3,1115,4.58
7913419,4,B00000JSIH,"There is no end to the ongoing battle among Tenchi fans concerning the Tenchi in Tokyo series. Many genuinely enjoy the series' unusual animation and more light-hearted approach, while many others feel that TinT is far too slapstick in nature for what is one of the best and most popular ongoing anime sagas. However, anyone who has seen Tenchi in Tokyo agrees that this volume contains the turning point of the series, both in style and content.
Early episodes of Tenchi in Tokyo appear to have been aimed at a relatively young target audience. The action is slapstick in nature, and the ""SuperDeformed"" style of animation is resorted to frequently. In fact, much of the story line is just plain silly.
However, with episodes 15 and 16, the series makes a sharp turn toward the better. The animation settles into a more conventional and familiar style, the story becomes much more sober and mature, and the relationships among the characters start to solidify. In particular, the interplay between Tenchi, Sakuya and Ryoko in the last two episodes of this volume becomes very intense and often poignant. From this point on, Tenchi in Tokyo is a series to be reckoned with.
For those who enjoyed TinT, this is the pivotal volume, and likely a favorite. For those who can't quite make up their minds, this is the volume to start with.
Either way, if you are a Tenchi fan, or just interested in some entertaining romantic comedy, this is a very good DVD.",986860800,3,1452,4.765873015873016
