1885270,5,B00009MEKK,I absolutely loved this movie. If you enjoy Jerry Lewis antics at their best then you'll love this movie. He was superb as a bumbling husband that does everything to impress his wife and make a fast buck. It was great!,1150848000,,218,4.341463414634147
1885271,1,B00009MEKK,"With all the good Jerry Lewis comedies awaiting DVD release (and, yes, there are good ones), who greenlighted this loser? Hey, Columbia, why did you ignore the very funny THE BIG MOUTH and release this turkey instead? I don't get it (and in terms of a DVD purchase, I didn't). Even Jerry disowns this staggeringly unfunny farce about a wacky American loose in England, whose get-rich-quick schemes get him involved with a host of unsavory characters. No matter what side of the Atlantic you're on, this is a jolly bad show. I love Jerry, but this is the pits.",1132272000,3,559,4.656565656565657
1885272,2,B00009MEKK,"In 1967, Jerry Lewis starred in what arguably may be his worst film ever: a little gem entitled ""Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River"".  Directed by Jerry Paris (1925-1986) and based upon a novel of the same name by author Max Wilk, the film begins in London where Jerry Lewis plays an American entrepreneur named George Lester.  He marries Pamela (Jacqueline Pearce) and whisks her away to various exotic locations for several years while trying to build a business of his own with the supposed financial assistance from a crooked British businessman named H. William Homer (Terry-Thomas, 1911-1990).  Tired of living away from London, Pamela leaves George, who also returns to London.  Without money and wanting to give Pamela a more permanent home, George comes up with an unusual business idea: he turns Pamela's inherited home into a Chinese restaurant/discothque.  Seeing what he's done to her house, Pamela threatens to have George thrown in jail and moves into a hotel.  She then begins to have an affair with a wealthy British oilman named Dudley Heath (Nicholas Parsons), who has the plans for a revolutionary new oil drill.  Thrown into this unusual story is a male flight attendant/auto-mechanic named Fred Davies (Bernard Cribbins) whom George had talked into selling Portuguese-made sports cars that nobody wants.  Also thrown into the story is the leader of a British girl scouts troop named Lucille Beatty (Patricia Routledge, who may be best known for her title role as Hyacinth Bucket in the British TV sitcom ""Keeping Up Appearances"" that ran between 1990-1995).

Aside from a few funny scenes, such as Fred serving people on board the cheap airlines that he works for and scenes involving Lucille, the film staggers along and fails to sufficiently engage the audience or be truly funny.  Overall, I cannot rate this film with a rating higher than 2 out of 5 stars and cannot recommend it.  Had the film had better direction, it may have been far more entertaining and successful.  Unfortunately, it was neither.",1117324800,3,2034,5.020833333333333
1885273,4,B00009MEKK,"Jerry Lewis the great in a mature responsible (?) role or is it? Don't know what it is but this movie pulled it off very charmingly to become a classic hidden gem in comedy movies.
It was a pleasure to watch English actor Terry-Thomas, Patricia Routledge,(Keeping Up Appearances), one actor from Fawlty Towers and mature responsible (?) Jerry Lewis- always cooking up his next gig..
Hilarious comedy recommended for late night viewing  so you don't miss out very intricate plot..:)",1057708800,5,481,5.0125
1885274,4,B00009MEKK,This one seemed a bit different for Jerry but was still a good movie. Worth getting and adding to the Lewis collection on DVD.,1379030400,,126,4.291666666666667
1885275,5,B00009MEKK,"I know I'm showing my age, when I say I've been a fan since Martin & Lewis days.

this is one of Jerry's works, and he still had it, as far as I'm concerned.

if you want a laugh, give this one a view.

1885276,2,B00009MEKK,"I love the title sequence over the song ""Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River"" with an impish Jerry walking his way thru London (if you look closely you can see people who are passing him kind of turn and wonder, 'Is that who I think it is?'), but overall this late 60's Jerry Paris directed comedy is pretty bland.  Even with Patricia (Keeping Up Appearances) Routledge and Terry-Thomas in the cast the film delivers few laughs.  This was one of those films which Lewis did post 1964 to mature his screen image--and while an effort like BOEING-BOEING (imo)worked, this film just doesn't deliver.  Lewis once wrote that it was his ""financial pleasure"" to make this film--well, I'm glad somebody got some pleasure out of it.",1375574400,,726,4.746031746031746
1885277,5,B00009MEKK,VERY FUNNY LOVE IT.  JERRY LEWIS IS THE BEST. ALWAYS WILL ORDER HIS MOVIES.  WOULD LOVE TO SEE ARTIST AND MODELS BUT THEY ONLY HAVE IT ON REGIONAL PAL WHICH I CAN NOT SEE ON MY DVD SO I HAD TO RETURN IT.  HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE AVAILABLE.,1361750400,,236,3.875
1885278,4,B00009MEKK,Gotta be a Jerry Lewis fan - and if so you'll enjoy this one alot! Pretty much Jerry being Jerry in classic Jerry style!,1360540800,,120,4.041666666666667

1885280,4,B00009MEKK,"I know some people will disagree with my opinion that Raise The Bridge, Lower The River is not a terrible film. Yes, it's far from the best of Lewis's films, but I actually liked it overall. It's not a very funny movie, but it manages to be charming at times, and if you are a Lewis fan, as I am, you will probably enjoy it. I give it a B-",1351296000,2,339,3.857142857142857
1885281,1,B00009MEKK,"This movie is beyond bad.  It's just plain long-stupid- and not funny.  It takes a BIG ego to make a movie this awful and star in it. This is an embarrassment for Lewis -it's that awful; watch JL chain smoke act like he's so cool.  This was the 60's remember?  The time of the Beatles-Stones-Doors; and here's Lewis acting as he's part of the London hipster scene.  Makes you cringe when you watch it; as I said, it takes a big ego to make a movie this rotten during those times.  If I were JL, I would have bought every copy and burned them.",1332979200,,542,4.163461538461538
1885282,1,B00009MEKK,"Jerry Lewis traveled to England for this lame 1968 farce, which cannot be salvaged by the presence of Terry-Thomas. Some viewers may appreciate a restrained Jerry, but the results are deadly dull. Even the King of Crazy admitted he did this one solely for the money. Produced by Walter Shenson in a sad comedown from the glory days of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The Mouse That Roared.""",1220313600,3,384,4.661764705882353
1885283,3,B00009MEKK,"As a big fan of Jerry Lewis,this was not one of his best efforts. Sure there were some funny moments in DRTB,LTR especially at the opening and with Terry Thomas planning the schemes..but it just wasn't the Jerry I was accustomed to. I am kind of mixed on this movie. Wish the story line was a little bit better.",1188000000,,311,4.288135593220339
7991759,2,B00009MEKK,"Be forewarned if you're looking (like I did) for Jerry to do any comedy in this film: Jerry is the straight man. No slapstick here, no hijinks. It's not ""zany"" as the back cover promises. It's mostly like the non-Peter Sellers parts of the original Pink Panther but less slick. The highlight, if there is one, may be Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth from Keeping Up Appearances) in an early role.",1503273600,,392,4.695652173913044
7991760,5,B00009MEKK,"A great comedy about what women want, or need. And how hard a man tries to give so much more, yet never realizing what is most important in a relationship. Men and women differ so greatly. Adult Satire in rich comedy. So true to life.",1459209600,,234,4.222222222222222
7991761,2,B00009MEKK,Not the Jerry Lewis I'm used to. It was all over the place and didn't keep my attention and too few good laughs.,1450051200,,112,3.9130434782608696

7991768,4,B00009MEKK,"Again, not one of Jerry Lewis' best comedies but at least fans get to see their hero in London back when being in London was fab.  Now considered a hard-to-get classic, fans will have little to no problem getting this film from one of the friendly Amazon vendors.  Hurry, though, because the French Lewis fans might beat you to the punch!",1405900800,,338,4.524590163934426
