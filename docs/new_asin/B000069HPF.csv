1734690,5,B000069HPF,"You won't believe this, but I am actually a 22-year old male who was really drawn into the story of Cinderella! I was engrossed by its overwhelming charm.

Yes, I have seen the Disney version too. And most people seem to prefer it to this one. I, however, disagree. Even though the Disney version is more detailed (with the mice having personalities and all), the Jetlag version focuses a lot better on the Cinderella-side of the story.

I saw the Jetlag version first, and was instantly hooked. Then I decided to watch the Disney version, hoping to be as hooked. And I won't lie, I was hooked by it as well. However, I couldn't help but compare it to the Jetlag version as I watched it. Sure, the animation quality in the Disney version was a lot better, but it seemed to lack some focus on the prince. He danced with Cinderella before she ran off. And when they were in the lookout for her, it was mainly the king's right-hand man (and not the prince himself) concerned about her whereabouts. Whereas in the Jetlag version, the prince himself was actively looking for his beloved. So in other words, I thought that the prince in the Disney version was less romantic (even though he kissed her hand).

As for the mice and their personalities, I felt like I was watching an episode of Tom and Jerry when that cat (Lucifer) got involved. While I like Tom and Jerry, the story should have been focused more on Cinderella instead.

But don't get me wrong. I think both the Jetlag AND Disney versions are worth watching. Both have their ups and downs. The Jetlag version is directly based off of Charles Perrault's 17th century version of the tale. The Disney version is a tad different (i.e. both parents of Cinderella pass on, mice with personalities, the king without his queen, etc.). It still has the main elements of Perrault's version though.

I don't understand why some people thought the Jetlag version was trash. They make it sound like it's an abomination to society or something. And I'm not only talking about the reviews here in Amazon. I thought the animation and character voices were great for a small production company. Jetlag is now bankrupt, but they were NO WHERE NEAR the Disney organization back when they were in business. Yet, Jetlag still managed to create a fabulous piece of work.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I am a male adult. And I think Cinderella is for everyone, not just for children. The message in the story can really help a lot in real life. If you enjoy fairy tales, or are looking for a new movie to watch, give Cinderella a try (Jetlag and/or the Disney version). And if you can apply your mind into it, I can almost guarantee you'll be as engrossed by it as I was.",1291939200,3,2710,4.543032786885246

1734692,5,B000069HPF,"I'm so glad I bought this DVD.This Cinderella version is better than Disney's and the girl is more pretty. And the songs,so beautiful. Highly recommended!!!",1117584000,8,156,5.28
1734693,5,B000069HPF,"Our 3 year old ADORES the story of Cinderella.  So we decided to get her a DVD.  Then the decision became between this and a VHS of the Disney version.  Well, we couldn't decide, so we bought both.

As far as film making goes, the Disney one is clearly the better one.  HOWEVER, my 3 year old got bored with the Disney one.  She did not care about the singing mice and how pretty the animation was.  She wanted to see Cinderella and that's that.

This version is the story as we all know it.  It is simple, it is easy to watch and it emphasises several times how Cinderella's true beauty came from with in.  My daughter LOVED this version SOOOO much that she sat thru it 2x in a row when we first played it.

When I have to 2 side by side, she chooses this version every time.  So, with that said, I give it 5 stars.  I am not a movie critic, I am a mother and my daughter LOVES this!",1109980800,23,884,3.9828571428571427
1734694,5,B000069HPF,"""Cinderella"" was one of the earliest animated films from Jetlag Productions, and possibly their very best.  Jetlag Productions is one of the companies that produced low-budget animated films for the infamous GoodTimes Entertainment company, along with the much superior Golden Films producer, so being ""their very best"" doesn't necessarily guarantee a good film.  However, ""Cinderella"" has often, not widely but often, been heralded as ""better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-version/dp/B0007Z9R7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney version</a>.""  Naturally, this is the opinion of just a number of individuals.  In terms of technical quality, the animation in Jetlag Productions' film does not compare to Walt Disney's delicate and stylish touch.  On the other hand, the way the story of Cinderella is handled in the 1994 version is more direct, spending less time building the character of mice and minor characters, and more time in telling the classic fairy tale.  For this reason, I understand why some people may prefer Jetlag Productions' version to the Disney one.  I personally, I'm glad to have seen them both.

The story of Cinderella, adapted by French fairy tale author Charles Perrault, is a story known by many, and Jetlag Productions did not change it much for their animated adaptation.  The story begins when a rich man, blessed with wealth, a comfortable home and a loving family, loses his wife to illness and is left alone with his beautiful daughter.  He decides to marry again, choosing for a wife a wicked woman who brings along her two unattractive daughters.  The daughter of the rich man is not happy about this, especially when her father leaves on a business trip and her stepmother and stepsisters take over her home.  Because she sleeps on a straw mat by the fireplace and is often covered by cinders, she is named ""Cinderella.""  Cinderella is forced to do all the chores around her house, including washing dishes and cleaning stairs, while her stepsisters play and have fun.  One day at the palace of the kingdom, the king's son had just come of age and his parents were anxious for him to chose a proper wife.  The prince had been unlucky finding the right girl to marry.  His father decides to prepare a grand ball and invite all of the eligible young ladies in the land, an idea that appeals to the prince as long as the choice is his alone.  Word of the ball reaches Cinderella's home, but she immediately told that she will not be attending it.  Cinderella receives a visit then from her fairy godmother, telling her that she will attend the ball.  With the help of a magic wand, Cinderella is presented with a new gown, glass slippers and her very own coach to transport her to the palace.  She is given the warning that the spell will wear off at midnight and that she must return home before then.  Cinderella promises to be home before the clock strikes twelve, but at the palace, she has the honor of dancing with the prince throughout the night, until she is startled by the clock striking twelve.  Cinderella runs off into the royal maze, where her gown turns into her old drags, and where she loses one of the two glass slippers that had not disappeared.  The glass slipper is the prince's only key to find his true love, because both he and Cinderella are sure that they love each other.

""Cinderella"" is easily the best animated film Jetlag Productions has done.  The only other film that I can think of that could match this one title in quality is their 1995 adaptation of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Red-Riding-Hood/dp/6303625878/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Red Riding Hood</a>,"" another animated tale filled with colorful characters, catchy songs and a nice handful of good moral lessons.  ""Cinderella"" features colorful and well-drawn backgrounds, neither the characters nor the artwork feel ""stuffy"" or overdone in the sense that creates an uncomfortable feeling when watching.  The level of saturation in the overall look is well balanced, strong uses of reds and greens (a big flaw in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White/dp/B000069HPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White</a>,"" 1995) are left out, replaced with softer colors.  The voice acting is probably some of the best as well.  A major complaint I've always had about Jetlag Productions' titles is the ridiculous amount of clichd and corny voice-acting that was simply unbearable to listen to sometimes.  The animation is overall well-done, with just a few scenes where the characters' movements were jerky or just plain silly (a moment that sticks out is one during the opening song where Cinderella spins around looking like a propeller).  The music was very nice, particularly some of the original melodies played during the ball scenes are very memorable indeed.  Due to a common rule that became a standard in all later Jetlag films, ""Cinderella"" features three songs: the opening song, ""Dream On, Cinderella,"" where the story is told briefly, is memorable and pleasant to listen to (though I've had trouble understanding some of the lyrics), ""The Chance Of A Lifetime,"" where the stepsisters sing about their chance to marry the prince and have their dreams come true, and finally, ""Where Have You Been All My Life"" where in dreams, Cinderella and the prince sing to each other about their love and their longing to be reunited.  All three songs are wonderfully catchy and well-written.  Overall, though ""Cinderella"" perhaps does not compare to the charming productions of Golden Films, such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thumbelina/dp/B000069HPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thumbelina</a>"" (1993) and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/B000069HPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>"" (1993), it is one of the best Jetlag Productions films out there and children, particularly little girls, are bound to find it enchanting.",1095897600,11,6117,5.506951871657754
