Helpful in developing my skills with the Autoharp!

8075911,4,B000A7S1V8,good for beginners or those that need a little more instruction. Fast paced but can go back and review anytime,1358812800,,110,4.55
8075912,3,B000A7S1V8,This DVD has some GREAT stuff but if you don't already have a familiarity with the autoharp and the chord bar assembly and arrangement then this DVD is not for you.,1355788800,3,164,4.32258064516129
8075913,1,B000A7S1V8,"I love Bryan Bowers but this DVD was a disappointment. I play several instruments and am good about figuring things out on my own but now with this DVD. He just plays really really fast and doesnt explain how to play it. He doesn't even tell you the chords or key he is playing in. Get ""Beginning Autoharp"" by Evo Bluesteing instead. It is a good beginners DVD.",1343520000,12,361,4.323529411764706
8075914,5,B000A7S1V8,"Although I was somewhat disappointed that Mr. Bowers did NOT give a step-by-step instruction on how to pick out a melody, he DID point me in the right direction and I was able to learn a specific tune off of youtube.

Everything else was right on, perfect for a beginner -- especially the 3 tuning techniques he uses.  I have yet to really, really practice several tunes (just one, for right now) every day.  But I know that if I do, I will be a very good player!!

Thanks!",1251417600,6,473,4.280898876404494
8075915,1,B000A7S1V8,I was really looking forward to watching this DVD to learn new strumming techniques on my autoharp. Bowers spends about thirty seconds explaining a strumming technique and then performs it at full speed. He doesn't slow it down or work through it one step at a time. He does spend about five minutes explaining how to put adjust a strap. I was very disappointed.,1210982400,11,362,4.671875
8075916,4,B000A7S1V8,"I got my wife an autoharp for last Christmas and lo and behold, it doesn't play itself! Brian Bowers does a nice job of showing how to play this fascinating instrument, and this will be a nice DVD for you whether you're a beginner or someone looking for more tips. He also has a friendly, easygoing manner and a pleasant voice.",1201478400,8,327,4.377049180327869
