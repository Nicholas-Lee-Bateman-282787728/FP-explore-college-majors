8263419,4,B0016MZF38,"I have already tried the technique at the range.  It works!  I was amazed!  Thirty shots at a man sized target and not a shot missed.  By the end of the session I was putting a double tap, one center mass, one head shot at 12 feet with each of my carry pistols, ...38 snubby....45 ACP XDS..and .44 Magnum...all without using the sights.

I give 5 stars for content.  The one star deduction was for being an old production,  so-so photos, etc.",1477440000,,442,4.317073170731708
8263420,5,B0016MZF38,"This is a video version of  the book 'Bullseyes don't shoot back'. This is an excellent video  for anyone who doesn't buy into the idea that in a life and death situation you will actually have time to get into the proper stance 'du jour', that every trainer wants to push.
I've been uncomfortable for a long time because I felt that there would be a clash between theory and reality.
I'm willing to bet my life that this is the way to go.",1472428800,3,439,4.214285714285714

8263422,5,B0016MZF38,"One of the best videos on shooting the handgun ever made. It is comprehensive, yet simple. It is also highly effective. This video, along with Matt Temkin's Shoot Him To the Ground deal with the most modern applications of point shooting. Aimed fire using both hands has its place, depending on the conditions of the encounter. But point shooting should be your foundation. I highly recommend this for any serious student of armed self protection.",1440115200,,447,4.973333333333334
8263423,5,B0016MZF38,"""SHOOTING FOR KEEPS - Point Shooting for Close Quarter Combat,"" by Michael Janich and Rex D. Applegate, is a superb view of one of the least taught, vital, and battle/combat proven methods of pistolcraft...  Natural in it's practice, absolutely lethal in execution, the concepts of ""point and shoot"" have been around for over three hundred years, but never before, put to formalized teaching, and first put to film, then now, on DVD...  The methodology was used by agents and special operations troops, from WWII, through the Cold War, and is still being taught, and used, today...

It's the only method that can be practiced at home, and have the same repeatable results in the field, or on the field, of combat...  It's the only method that is, after a short period of formal training, usable without expending days on the firing line, expending countless thousands of rounds down range- on a regular basis...  Anybody can use, and master it, to the extent to which one is able...

Remember, most civilian armed encounters occur within 21 feet.  Likewise, most civilian armed encounters occur at night, or with very low light visibility.  Most armed civilian encounters happen without, or little, warning...  These three reasons are why this DVD is so important.  It addresses all three points of critical importance...  Distance, light, speed...  Using this DVD to train, and renew your skill sets periodically, will give you the ability and confidence to better survive a close, unanticipated, poor location/situation, engagement...

How do I rate this DVD?  Five out of Five Stars.  Yes, I most definitely do recommend this type of shooting methodology exhibited in ""SHOOTING FOR KEEPS - Point Shooting for Close Quarter Combat.""  With no hesitation, or reservation, I do recommend this DVD- because I use what is taught herein...",1395014400,4,1835,5.10738255033557
8263424,4,B0016MZF38,"This is a great video.  Production value is very 1990's but it's worth it for the apperance of Col Rex Applegate in the last segment.  I'm sure this video drives the shooting games industry crazy.  It's simple, it's instinctual, and you can teach it to yourself.  You don't need to pay a former SEAL or Delta Force Operator $500 plus meals, lodging, and transportation to teach you how to do it!",1328140800,5,395,4.52112676056338
