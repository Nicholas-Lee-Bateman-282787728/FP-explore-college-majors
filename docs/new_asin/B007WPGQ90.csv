8522698,1,B007WPGQ90,"This is not a Blue-Ray disc.  It's only a DVD and comes with a pair of cardboard red/blue glasses.
Obviously an amateur movie manufactured in someone's home.",1431216000,,157,4.814814814814815
8522699,1,B007WPGQ90,"Do Not Waste Your Money.  This is the poorest-quality DVD I've ever received.  If I had to guess, I'd say that it was a copy-of-a-copy of a very-low-budget movies that was first shot on 8-track tape.  One thing is certain and that's the 3D version was not shot in 3D but is such a poor attempt at conversion it could only have been done with a $9.99 software program.  The 2-D version option is just as defective. On top of it all, there is no story line, just a girl trying to look seductive in her 1950's underpants, pretending to touch herself and making orgasmic faces.",1426636800,2,573,4.377358490566038

8522701,1,B007WPGQ90,"This is the worst'""movie"" ever produced in the world. Camera work had to be the work of a four year old with ADD.
 Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap.if I could I would have given this a a minus 4 stars",1404259200,6,220,3.782608695652174
8522702,1,B007WPGQ90,"This is the worst thing I have ever ordered in my entire life. The movie quality is very poor! In fact I have never even seen a home movie made this bad. The picture was grainy, very poor quality, and the 3D effects were horrible and really didn't work. By the title you would expect it to be a little more erotic but when you watch it all is you see is girls smoking dope, with quick glimpses of T & A. Bad Bad Bad!!!!!",1394323200,4,420,3.9529411764705884
8522703,2,B007WPGQ90,"Item came in as shipping promised but the overall movie was slow, bad music, and did needed the old 3D glasses.  Will not work in updated 3D vision",1355788800,7,147,4.25
8522704,5,B007WPGQ90,"If you're expecting a sex comedy, this is definitely not that. If you're expecting a porno of any kind really, whether soft or hard, this is definitely not that. If you're into fetishes like smoking or lingerie, and like surreal and trippy stuff that you can zone out to (or get turned on by, as it's really your choice), then this is more likely that. The 3D feature is the primary reason to get this. It looks good with and without the glasses, but it is that and the bonus features (the music video starring Darenzia, and the short bonus clip with Sybil Hawthorne) that make this a worthwhile DVD. Anyhow, I would say that this is one of the only times that a film with an erotic style to it, is best watched as an art film or better yet experienced as a psychedelic substance in its own right. Not your typical fare. If you want that, pick up a Playboy on the soft side, or watch something from Burning Angel or Vivid on the hard end. This is for fans of transgressive cinema, Taschen books, and video art.",1355702400,6,1010,4.321052631578947
