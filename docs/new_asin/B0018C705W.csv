8269374,5,B0018C705W,"John McCain - Bio. I stumbled upon this on-sale. I must admit - I met his daughter Meghan McCain - when John was running for president. She was very down to earth and friendly.  I don't particularly follow politics - so it was a bit out of character for me to watch a DVD about a politician. The whole thing was insightful. Amazing - I did not know John had been a fighter pilot or about a horrific accident on the carrier he served. - All he went through.
Being a P.O.W. and some candid remarks he makes of moments he is not proud of in his life (but learned from).
I recommend this documentary!!

8269375,2,B0018C705W,"I always held John McCain in high regards.  He even had my vote until he chose Sarah Palin as his running mate.  Then I decided once more not to waste my vote since neither McCain's Vice President nor Barrack Obama felt right for the highest office in the land.  After seeing this Bio, I think I might have changed my mind sooner.  There were alot of things presented in this bio that I did not know McCain had previously done.  People can call him a war hero all they want.  But he is little better than John Carrey.  If I had seen this video sooner, it would not have changed my vote (considering I did not vote) bet it would have my mind up faster.",1297555200,,651,4.16

8269377,3,B0018C705W,"I watch this to make myself an opinion as I am an ""undecided"" voter.

Definitely, John McCain should be regarded as war hero. No doubt about that.

I am not so sure about is political capabilities. The president of the United States cannot be elected based on sympathy and what he endured in Vietnam.

Watching this documentary, I cannot see what change he can make to the US.

A legend for the US army, but not presidential material.",1224892800,,434,4.5256410256410255
