dangerous film they made about armageddon predicted by the Mayans for
Dec 21 2012.  This was an unusual twist on the 2012 theories.  I
loved the music!",1335657600,,222,4.641025641025641
4520654,5,B00519BP1I,"DEFCON 2012 is an awesome indie sci fi movie.  In the distant future, after earth has been invaded by aliens in 2012, humans are either slaves of aliens or roaming scavengers who try to survive in the galaxy.  A group of scavengers comes back to earth and finds it lies in ruins with only a small group of humans still living deep underground below Houston, Texas in a place called Shelter City.  The surviving humans square off wth the leader of the aliens named Vulkl whi is intent on killing them and capturing Shelter City.  DEFCON 2012 has the best electronic music sountrack of all time. My favorite part of the movie is when a cyborg tries to eat a twinkie and spits it out.",1311897600,7,681,4.424

4520659,1,B00519BP1I,"The film opens with 8 minutes of news reports while showing us the credits. It then goes into a lengthy first person narration one that persists throughout the film. It seems the earth was destroyed in 2012 due to aliens that took some people captive as miners. One guy escapes and becomes a scavenger, visiting different planets for artifacts and things of value. That would indeed be a good film if they actually did it, and didn't read it to us. He is now on earth looking for something and uncovers a government secret.

The film is awful and most of you won't make it past 10 minutes. The sound is choppy and CG effects bad. I kept waiting for all the narration to end and the film to actually start. But when I saw how bad the acting was, I was now wishing they would simply narrate.

The good news is this stinker is worth 2 punches on a hackers card, normally reserved for bad films over 2 hour long.

4520672,1,B00519BP1I,"My opinion, this movie is horrible.  And that's saying a lot coming from me. My normal standard esp. for a free Amazon Prime movie is a movie doesn't have to be a great Oscar caliber movie to be watched.  Heck, it doesn't even have to be good.  Because in my opinion even a bad movie can be funny or entertaining.  Take ""Batman Forever"" for example.  It's often thought of as the worst Batman movie by a large number of people.  Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 41% rating.  But do I ""hate it"" (a 1-star rating on Amazon Prime 5 star rating scale), no.  I think it is funny at points and I can laugh at it.  Does ""Defcon 2012"" live up to this almost lowest common denominator level that I hold a movie to?  Unh Unh, no way, not even close, Ptuie (spitting sound).

The plot of the movie is basically people come to a burnt out world, that still is burning, by the way, to scavenge some junk to sell.  A futuristic ""Pickers"" if you will.  But while there is almost nothing to scavenge.  Every single drawer is empty or has broken glass in it. They keep looking around anyway.  There's this one guy, I thought he was a cyborg or android, but I was wrong.  He's actually an alien of some sort with a CGI head that often doesn't follow the movements of his body.  You find out that he's an alien because he finds a partial box of Twinkies and eats one.  After taking a bite he says, ""Not bad considering."" and his partner says, ""What about the bacteria?""  The alien spits out the Twinkie and says, ""I didn't think about the bacteria.""  And there you go.  That's the highlight of this movie.  There is nothing else to say about it.",1438732800,,1619,4.256578947368421

It takes something special to make a movie so terrible, even the most die-hard bad movie fan is writhing in agony. To give this movie one star would be to say I hated it. I don't hate it at all, in fact, I love this movie. This movie has touched my soul in a way no movie has ever before. There's nothing I can say that can really describe the depth of this remarkable piece of film history. It is such a perfect example of how not to make a movie, it should be hailed by film schools worldwide as the perfect teaching resource.

Everyone else has already touched on all the atrocities committed by this masterpiece of the terrible: atrociously muddy sound, lack of plot, terrible use of camera filters, lack of set dressing, poor CGI choices, mall office furniture, and complete inability to understand what in the hell was going on at any point in the movie.

4520748,1,B00519BP1I,"I admit it,  I have a thing for bad sci fi films, but this wasn't sci fi. This was people running around inside an old mall for way too long. The basic notion that they are scavenging for valuables doesn't hold up considering how long they looked and found nothing. Some of the narration was unintelligable due to poor sound quality. The helmet effect on one character didn't always match his actions. What plot there was proved inconsistent. I can't even recommend it for laughs.",1371081600,7,480,4.647058823529412
4520749,1,B00519BP1I,"This low-budget sci-fi film clearly demonstrates how incompetent sound design can destroy a film.  The film is slow moving and depends upon various characters describing the back story and what is currently happening to the viewer.  Unfortunately, the sound designer has worked overtime to insure that most of the dialog is unintelligable.  Each character's voice was apparently recorded separately and then edited together at the end.  The main character and his robot pal were actually standing within a few FEET of the microphone and so can occasionally be understood.  The two telepath characters spoke from a distance into a voice garbler and so only every fourth word or so can be understood.  The worst character is the earth girl who tells the backstory.  Her lines were apparently recorded in a high school gymnasium without the benefit of a microphone.  Add to this super-loud blaring rock music that is played whenever the characters get into a large room totally obscuring the dialog and you have a ""talkie"" that may as well as be a silent film.  The director thought of that as well as the film has no subtitles so the viewer can't ""see"" the lines that they can't hear either.  This picture should be shown in college sound design courses throughout the country as a model of how NOT to edit sound.

I lent this film to my brother to watch.  He returned it and said that he was unable to watch it as the actors seemed to be MUMBLING in a foreign language but the menu did not let him select ENGLISH as a language option.",1369440000,3,1533,4.700374531835206

4520759,1,B00519BP1I,"So generally I am pretty soft when it comes to reviewing movies and here's why.
1.  Being a small budget film maker myself I can understand the strong desire to create.
2. Getting inspired by a big budget film especially sci-fi (like Star Trek/Wars) can really inspire you to want to create your own version of the aforementioned creations.
3. Just the massive amount of effort that goes into the production of a small budget movie, even two guys and a camcorder is phenominal. The hard drive space, the score, any friends/actors. Just to get the cheesecake you see before you is a tremendous amount of effort on someone who believes part.
So all that being said I can forgive this movie for having some non original purchase on the internet 3d models some of which O have in my own arsenal and recognized immediately.
I can forgive the bad effects, and terrible setting if the movie is still somewhat engaging.
I didn't find the costumes as bad as some others may have I thought they were fairly well done for a no budget movie.
I can't forgive the potty mouth dialogue and the terrible way the narrator tries to tell us a story without any visual representation of said story. It's like we got 3 minutes of cheap 3d models and home animation/switch to some stock footage of a riot/switch back to 3d models/ swear a few times/ switch back to stock footage. 18 minutes into the film sounds goes silent I'd imagine it's where the traffic at the shopping center they filmed at overrode the actors dialogue so they said heck with it and cut the sound.
I never tell anyone NOT to watch a movie I think you SHOULD watch it and formulate your own opinion this one is mine and you know opinions are like armpits everyone has one and most stink.

Maybe we all missed something? Is this a retro noir film like Metropolis and it's not supposed to have sound?  If we didn't miss anything then I'm puzzled why it would take Amazon so long to fix this.
