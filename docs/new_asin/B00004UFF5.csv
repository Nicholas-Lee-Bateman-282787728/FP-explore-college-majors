Each procedure is clearly filmed and well-explained.  Additionally, the patterns tend to be simple to tie and extremely realistic...not to mention beautiful.  I was particularly impressed with his film, ""Tying with CDC"".  Give them a try!  You won't regret the investment.",981158400,2,413,4.913043478260869
