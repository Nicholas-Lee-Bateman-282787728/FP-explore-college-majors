8327377,5,B001NLQW8E,"I purchased this for my niece who is 4 and she loves the DVD!  I watched it with her and the songs and the characters are sweet and engaging.  I love the relationship between the main characters-a father and daughter. My niece was intrigued by the words and has watched it several times recognizing more and more words.  I actually purchased it on the Readeez website.  The prices are cheaper on Amazon, although the same if you use the 20% discount promotion code:  Friend of Michael).  On the website, I previewed some of the videos and watched videos about the author as we'll.",1397865600,,580,4.58252427184466
8327378,5,B001NLQW8E,"Our girl has been reading from age 2 and is fully reading BOB books series with ease, yet I was having trouble with her converting to solo-reading into the next genre of early readers.  eg.  Clifford the Big Red Dog series, Mercer Mayer's Little Critter books, Dr. Seuss books, Amelia Bedelia books.  We have also been using about 5 LeapFrog DVDs for the past 2 years.  In my search for something to help in the educational DVD department, I was not happy with what I found.  Rock N Learn has poke-my-eyes out graphics and the Preschool Prep DVDs are similarly low budget and mind-numbing for a kid who knows quality graphics and audio.

In my search for a great product, I came across Read-eez and then did a little research.  The guy who created this is a musician who puts words to great music.  The words he places on the screen come up in rhythm to his tunes.  What I really love about this is that kids are so programmed to watch DVDs and videos and follow the characters.  In this case, the characters become the words.  The words are doing the movement quite similarly to when one reads a book, with tempo, with rhythm.  It's quietly brilliant!

What I did not expect from this DVD is my child pulling books off of her bookshelf and putting them to song.  She knows so many of the books we have been reading for the past 4 years and she started singing them in opera!  It was incredible.  I could imagine her reading novels now with a symphony in the background creating setting the stage for the story line to unfold.

Now, the best part of all of this is the 2 year old, just starting to recognize words, knows his letters.  When the DVD is playing, he watches intently and taps his legs in rhythm to the story.

It's beautiful to see the emergence of young readers through such a wonderful media.  I very much look forward to more products from Read-eez!  This is a brilliant media with many possibilities for expanding the educational DVD choices!",1328400000,,1959,4.461971830985916
8327379,4,B001NLQW8E,"We just got Volumes One through Three plus the cd, and we have been enjoying every minute of Readeez.

The white screen with simple black border and clean simple illustrations make it easy to both listen and absorb the lyrics/text which appear on the screen in synch with the audio. My 5.5 yr old son likes to ""know"" the words to rhymes, songs, dvds, and the short vignettes in Readeez are just up his alley. They are almost like dvd comic strips, in that they are short, snappy and simple. Even before watching the dvd through the first time, he was picking up on repetitions in the text, on obvious rhymes, and chanting out loud with the characters. By the time we'd watched a couple times, he was shouting out lyrics with confidence when they appeared on the screen.

The fun little rhymes and ditties both help give musical rhythm and help with phonics, the strong center presence of the printed words (ie pan, man, well/swell) along with the voiced pronunciations helping form the links between word shape and word families.

The songs are, as touted, ridiculously catchy, with mom walking around singing ""How 'bout That Cow? She's out standing in her field"" (vol 1) and ""Modes of Transportation! Train train train train train! Bus bus bus bus bus!..."" (vol 2). One thing that I like is that although there is phonics and repetition, the text is neither didactic nor simple, nor confined to ""book speak"". All the bantering between Julian and Isabel Waters, the dad and daughter characters, is written out... so a child gets a taste of real conversation rendered in text.

Words such as chandelier, ""modes"" of transportation, and antidisestablishmentarianism make appearances in these videos, not just dog, log, frog, cat, bat, fat, mat. It's rather a relief from our regular phonics work and simplistic preschool themes. It feels like Readeez has room to grow for a young reader, from a child just beginning to associate word and text, to young independent readers breaking into multisyllable words (words appear syllable by syllable as they are pronounced, not just word by word).

One small complaint is that the selections are often self-referential, refering to ""Readeez"" itself a bit too often, feeling a bit like an infomercial. But this is a small complaint for a set that has lasted a long rainy weekend without boring us, and in fact prompted us to put on the related song cd to sing along, once we'd gotten a taste of the catchy ditties on dvd.

8327380,5,B001NLQW8E,"My 2 year old loves this DVD. The original songs are sweet and clever, and the classic nursery rhymes are presented so well. The ""characters"" are very likable and the words really do integrate with the speaking and singing. Even I (mom) am fascinated by the precise timing of the words on the screen with the audio. We don't get tired of the DVD (even mom and dad) and whenever my daughter sees a picture of Julian and Isabel she gets really excited and starts singing. It helps that her name is Isabel, too!

I have given this as a gift a few times and it is always a favorite. I'm looking forward to Volume Two!",1229904000,,613,4.2844827586206895
