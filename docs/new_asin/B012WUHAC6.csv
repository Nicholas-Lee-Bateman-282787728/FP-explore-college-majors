8726681,5,B012WUHAC6,"I do not like to write reviews and this will not be a review. But, all I have to say is this is one of my pride and joys that I own Blu Ray, i would have never though Pagan's Mind would release this to the U.S. For fans of Dream Theater, Pagan's Mind blows away the last 5 years of Dream Theater on this live. Superb sound quality. Fantastic vocals. Great stage presence. I've watched this twice now and it still send chills up and down my spine. But, I have been a Pagan's Mind fan since the beginning so this is special.",1461196800,,522,4.028846153846154

The audio and video quality are top notch!",1453420800,,96,5.0
8726685,5,B012WUHAC6,"I picked up this Blu-ray on a whim, never having heard these guys before. Being as they're from Norway that's hardly surprising. Like other reviewers say, it's hard not to think of Dream Theater when you see these guys play. Both bands feature 4 excellent musicians fronted by an operatic lead singer. Both bands also play hard edged prog rock with many extended instrumental sessions.  Technically this blu-ray is excellent. Audio/video quality are both top-notch, & the editing is pretty darn good as well. Absolutely no regrets on buying this, & I'm sure I'll be viewing it again before too long.",1449187200,2,599,4.930693069306931
