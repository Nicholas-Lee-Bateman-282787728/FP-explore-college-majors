5931706,4,B00EOS478A,Fascinating story but at the end of the series I felt that there must be another coming since it didn't seem like and ending.  Suppose there might be a 4th series next year?,1426377600,4,173,4.242424242424242

5931708,5,B00EOS478A,"Having watched every episode of HBO Network Rome Series, which wife and I thoroughly enjoyed, I disagree with reviewer who stated it was any better than The Borgias.

We picked up quite a bit of local history to include French Army's pillaging of Luca, Palazzo Farnese, Savonarola's followers huge Bonfires of the Vanities, Piazza Navona and Vatican Gardens.  It is no less historically accurate than HBO's Rome Series.

Warning:
Show is highly addictive.

We have just started the series, and while we love the acting etc, my husband and I rely on closed captioning so we don't miss out on any of the dialogue.

5931716,3,B00EOS478A,"I love the series but the formatting of the DVDs is odd, in that each disk is not segmented into episodes.  It all runs together and unless you are up to hours and hours of constant viewing, you will lose your place in viewing should you have to stop mid-DVD and then continue viewing at a later time.  I have not purchased any DVD series collections like this before, and I am not a fan of the format.

5931727,2,B00EOS478A,"hi Amazon! I bought this item, because I read the description,( coming from Canada) was in english and french languages; I am taking french classes; I received the dvd's and I was sooo satisfied with the audio and captions being in french. I watched season one and season 2; to my surprise season three did not have french translation at all, neither captions nor audio; at the beginning I thought it was my fault that I was doing something incorrect, but then I read the reverse of the dvd jacket, also there was only in english, that made me feel highly disappointed. If in the item description were explained that only 2 seasons were in french and the third one was not; then will me my choice if I order still or not. But in this way I feel like it was false advertising; Of course I cannot return the item because I already opened the package; but maybe...maybe, it will be nice if the dvd, 3rd. season, Amazon can  exchange it for one in english/french languages like seasons 1 & 2. Sorry I cannot give 5 stars being like this",1474243200,,1032,4.403141361256544

5931733,1,B00EOS478A,"Jeremy Iron's is a great actor but he still can't save a boring, mundane, and preposterous plot. The sword fighting is laughably hilarious. To put it bluntly, if I didn't buy the complete series, I probably would have stopped watching after episode 2. I suffered through the complete series and it never got better. On a positive note, I did find a cure for insomnia though.",1471737600,,374,4.681818181818182
5931734,3,B00EOS478A,"The sets, acting and costumes are wonderful.  I've been doing some research on the Borgias and find that the series is far more fact based than I would have believed.  That said, I will not be watching it again because the violence is nightmare inducing.  I DO realize that it was a violent time in history and that what is depicted is most likely pretty accurate, but it is way too much for me.  I will re-gift this set to someone who is less squeamish than I am.",1471478400,,464,4.238636363636363

5931736,4,B00EOS478A,I have to say this show had me hooked. I found the acting very good and the story intriguing. I really enjoyed the setting it was a nice break from what I usually watch. Even though I am trying to make the switch to Blu-ray I found the quality of the DVD set to be more than ok. My only issue was the 3rd season should've not been the last. The 3rd season moved too quickly to wrap everything up so it felt rushed.,1470355200,3,414,3.9404761904761907
5931737,5,B00EOS478A,"Great series, great acting. The production of these series was cut short, but even as is, one can accept it as a complete, satisfying work full of suspense and passion, beautifully acted and filmed.  After all, if the series followed history, it would be sad to see the death of Pope Alexander and rather gruesome end of Cesare Borgia. Just as well it ended when it did.
Highly recommended.",1468800000,,390,4.6521739130434785
5931738,4,B00EOS478A,"Actually a great companion series for the HBO Rome series, but by a different production company (including Showtime). It's uncanny how so much of ancient Rome survived in the Roman Catholic Church, with the papacy mimicking the emperors and the cardinals the Roman Senate. Outstanding acting by an international cast and some truly beautiful women to grace the screen. It's also a somewhat different look into the family life of the infamous Borgias, especially Lucretzia Borgia. Intense and somewhat risque at times, it nonetheless provides many riveting hours of viewing with a solid historical background.",1466985600,,609,5.421052631578948

The acting was suburb, the camera work and lighting as high quality as any first-rate movie, the costumes and set design absolutely stunning and the plot - though certainly not historically correct - was fascinating, lurid and addictive.  How I wish they would have gone on for at least one more season to finish up the life of the Borgia Pope.

5931746,5,B00EOS478A,"Purchased 3 season set believing it was complete. Yet it wasn't an officially ended show. Come to find out that there were original intentions of running a 4th season that may or may not happen.  As such, it was an unfinished ending. There is NO MAN HOTTER THAN CHESARE BORGIA!
Now I know why there were only Italian popes for 465 years (til Pope John Paul).",1460073600,2,358,4.424242424242424
5931747,5,B00EOS478A,"Intrigue, Bloody plots, mystery,  suspense, and a little bit of true history of the late to early 1400's and 1500's.  Just like the series Rome,  I am sure most of the history is fictional, but it gives you an idea on how these people lived and dressed so many centuries ago.  One thing is definitely  true,  the way the Vatican and the papacy ruled my Rome for so many centuries.  It is very professionally acted and I cannot say enough about the good acting of the main characters.  The actress that plays Lucrezia Borgia, is absolutely beautiful,  the face of a true renaissance  angel.  As I said, do not expect historical accuracy and you will truly enjoy the series.",1458172800,8,672,4.563025210084033

5931755,5,B00EOS478A,"Pursuaded to watch this series by my partner, I was immediately taken with The Borgias.  While raised as a Christian, I knew very little of Catholicism, its history or its followers (past and present).  The series created a hunger within for more information on this now infamous family.  It does, however, appear that Showtime cut the series short because of production costs.  Still, I enjoyed Showtimes rendition of the story of The Borgias.  I'm now watching the Netflix version which I'm told is less stylized, but far more factually accurate.",1453507200,9,548,5.044444444444444

5931758,5,B00EOS478A,"This is all three DVD seasons in a special-style box. Much as I was worried I was going to get a bootleg, that did not turn out to be the case. Great show that got just a good enough ending in its third season. There was potential for a fourth, but Showtime and Neil Jordan couldn't compromise on its structure from a reduced episode order to a made-for-TV movie. The book released that summed up the main plot for Season 4, which would have been the final season anyway, and it didn't work out on paper as it could have on film. But if you know how the characters wound up from real history anyway, take the ending of Season 3 as showing the family ending on a high note, as all three seasons showcase of them. It's entertaining all around, and best that it started and ended that way.",1452211200,2,786,4.246666666666667

5931760,4,B00EOS478A,"Very entertaining show. I must admit I felt season 1 to be very very slow but season 2 picks up and season 3 is by far the best of the lot. I feel the actors acted the best of their characters in season 3 and I had to keep watching to see what happened next. So disappointing that this show was cancelled it would have been great to see what the Borgia family got up to next.
Jeremy Irons as Rodrigo Borgia / Pope Alexander VI: is the weakest actor/character in the Borgias family. I love Jeremy Irons and he has played some amazing roles: highlights would be Scar from the Lion King and Aramis from the Man in the Iron Mask. The way Iron's acted in this show you'd think he didn't give a crap. Harsh I know, but he just sputtered out every line and his acting came across almost juvenile.
Franois Arnaud as Cesare Borgia: The best character and actor of this show. He was the favourite for me. Each season his character got better and better and got more power and basically just killed off everyone that stood against him or didn't agree with him. He was dark and cold in every scene, but kind and caring in scenes with his sister Lucrezia. He was very good at juxtapositioning between the two.
Holliday Grainger as Lucrezia Borgia: plays and the sweet and innocent daughter and sister. But is willing to get her hands dirty to get what she wants.
An entertaining show, that was cut short. This boxset comes in a beautiful slip box with embossed lettering.",1451865600,23,1458,4.3837638376383765
5931761,5,B00EOS478A,"The most powerful man of the Catholic church is just that at the end of the day, a man. Murder, greed, deception, and sex; and there's plenty of all those in this series. I'm pretty sure most of this is fictionalized, it was made for TV after all. But just the fact that this happened in real life back then is what got me to watch this series in the first place. After a couple weeks of watching it, I ended up completing it. Despite the ending being crappy, I still enjoyed.",1451088000,9,476,4.184782608695652
