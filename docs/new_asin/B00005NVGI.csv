2879836,5,B00005NVGI,"This 1986 KARL LORIMAR videotape is recorded in SP mode, has HiFi sound and a sharp, full screen picture.

Arthur Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning DEATH OF A SALESMAN played 742 times between 2/10/49 and 11/18/50. Its third and fourth Broadway revivals, both during 1984, was seen by 185 audiences. Of the subsequent TV cast, only Charles Durning and Anne McIntosh did not appear on stage.

SYNOPSIS--
Lately, traveling salesman Willie Loman hasn't been able to close deals like he once did. This naturally troubles Willie and may be the reason his mind is playing tricks on him. Willie often retreats into the past and relives -out loud- events long gone, including the day teenaged Biff came to Boston unannounced and caught him with his mistress.

Ever since that surprise visit, Biff's done nothing with his life and now his suicidal dad has just lost his job after 32 years of loyal service and hard miles. Thirty-four-year-old Biff is back home after years away and the old resentments and arguments pick up almost where they left off. His dramatic confrontation with Willie just before this story ends is heart-rending.

Hoffman and Malkovich are awesome as father and son, especially in that highly emotional climactic scene. They play off each other so well that what we see on screen at that moment ARE Willie and Biff Loman. It's theater art of the highest kind.

(7.2) Death of Salesman (TV-1985) - Dustin Hoffman/Kate Reid/John Malkovich/Stephen Lang/Charles Durning/Louis Zorich/Jon Polito/Linda Kozlowski",1284249600,2,1977,5.793103448275862
2879837,5,B00005NVGI,"This version of the venerable Arthur Miller tragedy reunites the Broadway revival cast, all veteran stage actors with strong film and TV rsums. Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman is a man on the verge of disintegration; he has built himself a faade of Successful Salesman that is crumbling down around his ears. One son still blindly, stupidly worships him (Happy, played by Stephen Lang); the other resents the charade and, despite his father's clichd supportive affirmations, purposely drifts through life as His Father's Disappointment (Biff, played to a bitter burnish by John Malkovich). Willy's wife Linda plays along, battered by his failed illusions and her sons' unhelpful life choices, knowing Willy's downfall is inevitable but dreading it all the same; Kate Reid is staggering, unforgettable, brilliant, strong yet despairing all at the same time. Charles Durning's turn as the Lomans' supportive neighbor is a small gem.

[For the reviewer who didn't appreciate Hoffman's work in this telefilm, I might ask: Have you actually ever read the play closely? Brian Dennehy is closer to the original Willy Loman-- Lee J. Cobb-- in physical stature and stage presence, but the character as written is a ""small man"" who imagines himself to be a Titan of Business, so a smaller actor provides interesting subtext and texture. The late, great Mildred Dunnock, the original Linda Loman, noted that Gene Lockhart (who replaced Cobb in the original Broadway production) was much closer to presenting Willy Loman as Miller wrote him; however, as she had built her Linda with Cobb's physically imposing Willy, she had to restructure her performance around Lockhart's smaller Salesman.]

This version does offer moments of lightness to offset the tragedy-- in fact, the fleeting glimpses of happy times make the tragedy of this little family even more shattering. Very worthwhile. Check it out the next time it's on TV!",1179446400,4,1910,5.238562091503268
2879838,3,B00005NVGI,"I love Death of a Salesman, and I was fortunate enough to see Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman in the Broadway version. Nothing has ever topped that performance since. Yet, even without that stellar performance to compare it with, I still would have been disappointed with Dustin Hoffman cast as Willy Loman in this movie version. Really, it annoys me that they cast Hoffman in that role when he clearly doesn't even look the part.  Hoffman would have been better cast as Charlie, but because he's a big star, I suppose he had to have the leading role.  They even changed some of the dialogue to suit Hoffman. For example, at one point in the actual play, Willy is telling his wife about an incident where he overheard some people making fun of him. The line mentions something about the people calling him a walrus. This fits Dennehy because he's such a big man (I'm not calling him a walrus, but he's big and tall). However, they knew how ridiculous that would seem coming from Hoffman, so they changed the lines so that Willy tells his wife that he overheard some people calling him a shrimp.

However, John Malkovitch is superb as Biff, so it may be worth watching for his performance alone.",1173916800,2,1191,4.582159624413146
2879839,5,B00005NVGI,"Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich shine in this now classic play. Like Nora in Ibsen's ""A Doll's House,"" we have characters confined by prescribed fate looking to climb out into their own.

What is fate?

In this case, Willy Loman is bound by his belief that personality alone, of being liked, is enough to make it to the American Dream. Unable to reconcile that those days never existed, and that hard work involved more than a firm handshake and a smile, he becomes despondent as he thinks of the lost potential. He is reminded in flashbacks and visions of relatives and friends who have succeeded.

His two sons are also confined to Willy's delusions of grandeur. Biff, played by Malkovich, had a future as a football star, but was handicapped by his dad's inhibitions and lack of reality. When he realizes his dad is a failure without integrity, after idolizing him, he concludes he too will be a failure.

Hap, on the other hand, Bif's brother, played by Stephen Lang, is a young Willy. He thinks his dad is right, and although he lives in futile mediocrity, believes dreaming is enough.

Kate Reid plays Willy's wife, Linda. She knows Willy is a failure, but tries to exist within the lie. She never declares the truth, but instead allows Willy to dream without substance.

Willy's hopes are shown worthless when he meets up with those, like Bernard, the nerdy math geek when Bif and Hap were children, and now practicing law in front of the Supreme Court. Willy asks what the secret is. His dream is nothing but the puff of a distortion of a Horatio Alger story, but he won't accept it. Bernard's father, Willy's neighbor, offers him a job, but Willy refuses.

The conflict is about encountering reality, and who will meet the truth. Can Biff live his simple dream of working outside with his hands, but by doing so must destroy the family structure. He knows it, and so he struggles.

Willy Loman's failure is like the hope of an old spiritual show follower, looking for salvation, but not willing to commit to what gets paired with it. It is a search for meaning. Despite a pessimistic premise, there is hope resident in this amazing film.

I fully recommend ""Death of a Salesman.""

2879850,5,B00005NVGI,"In 1966, I saw the Lee J. Cobb television version of Death of a Salesman. It made a great impression on me. For over 50 years, I remembered the dialog from the wire recorder scene and the Supreme Court scene. I looked for the play on video for years and I finally found it in this Dustin Hoffman version.  This version is different from what my memory is of the 1966 version. I recall that in the wire recorder scene, the Cobb character actually wanted and thought he could buy the hundred-and-a-half-dollar machine when he was about to beg for a $50 a week position. Cobbs version of Willy stayed in my mind as more desperate and delusional than Hoffmans but perhaps that is just my 51-year-old memory. I liked the Hoffman version of the character as a man realizing and denying that his life had been a lie  a lie he made to himself.",1503100800,,835,4.380645161290323

2879852,2,B00005NVGI,"Death of a Salesman is easily one of my favorite plays. It is a masterful commentary on capitalism and the deterioration of The American Dream. Arthur Miller's script does not disappoint; so why only two stars? Two words: Dustin Hoffman.

Dustin Hoffman is a dreadful Willy Loman. In Hoffman's performance the viewer never sees a man who actually believed in that American Dream; instead, the viewers see a frail old man who was likely always a frail man. I don't buy that he ever believed in the system. Willy is much better played by an actor who is a hulking husk of a man who has been defeated by the system that he put all of his faith into.

Hoffman is certainly not the worst actor to play the role on screen. That honor goes to Fredric March who inexplicably earned a Golden Globe Award and Oscar nomination for his turn as a crazed lunatic in the role of Willy Loman. While other versions are harder to track down, it is worth it. For better interpretations, I recommend seeking out the 1966 version featuring original Willy, Lee J. Cobb, or the 2000 version starring Brian Dennehy. Both Cobb and Dennehy deliver masterful performances in the lead role and both are surrounded by amazing supporting actors.

On a side note, if you are thinking of attempting to track down the the 1996 version starring Warren Mitchell, I would probably recommend against it. It is nicely divided into six sections for easy classroom use, but it suffers from poor American accents by an otherwise just acceptable British cast.  Often the poor accents are distracting from the action. Also, Mitchell is another weak and frail Willy.",1497744000,,1622,4.720848056537102

2879892,4,B00005NVGI,"Dustin Hoffman breathes a certain life into the tortured braggart losing control of his mind.
