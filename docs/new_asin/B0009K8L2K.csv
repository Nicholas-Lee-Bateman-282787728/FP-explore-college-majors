8062370,5,B0009K8L2K,Great Live performance by two men who share an obvious bond and a mutual joy in dipping into the oeuvre of Little Feat. The acoustic editions of these tunes are satisfying and often interestingly charming.,1395360000,,205,4.885714285714286
8062371,5,B0009K8L2K,"35 years of playing together really shows with Fred and Paul.  No...not tired rehash versions of the old stuff...but rather spirited, passionate, loving versions of songs we all know the words to.  Really great performances of really great songs.  I miss Lowell...but these guys don't just imitate...they are Little Feat in 2010 and they channel Lowell...get it and learn baby",1269561600,,376,5.233333333333333
8062372,3,B0009K8L2K,"Paul and Fred give an acoustic performance for a small group in this live DVD. Most Feat classic songs are performed here with the two with their acoustic guitars. Performances are spirited and it really shows the swing and groove Paul Barrere's songs and and his interplay with Fred Tackett is also very good. The price is right for this package and sound is really very good, but then again its just two acoustic guitars but sound and picture is very good nontheless. 15 songs are offered here at full length. Worthy pickup for Little Feat fans or fans of acousti-boogie.",1122681600,5,573,4.683168316831683
