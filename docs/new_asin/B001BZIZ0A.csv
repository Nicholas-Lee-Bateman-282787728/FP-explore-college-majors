8285350,4,B001BZIZ0A,"Bruce Bickford is a mad genius.  This film is an excellent example of his unique clay animation work.  If you are a fan of animation where everything on the screen is moving and changing you need to see this film.  It's short, only 28 minutes, but packed with bizarre and surreal images; the screen is constantly alive with his morphing writhing creations. The story doesn't really make much sense, but who cares, it's amazing.  There is a commentary track and some behind the scenes footage.",1292371200,,492,4.752941176470588
8285351,5,B001BZIZ0A,"Bickford's ""Premoethius"" is truly awe inspiring. Half of those I show it to can't even take its trippy quality. They say ""I am getting dizzy"". Frankly I love the immersive quality of clay, and look what Bruce has done with it. Nobody pushes the medium to this level(s!). When Bruce is gone (I hope not for a long while),",1287792000,,320,4.440677966101695
8285352,5,B001BZIZ0A,"I've watched only the title feature from this disk, I have to admit. Voluminous extras and alternatives still await me. I prefer to form my own opinions before filling myself with others' commentaries, though, and this one takes time to digest.

It comes in just under a half hour, but seems like a lot more. Bickford fills every moment in this garden with transformation and movement - don't blink, or you might miss the crucial link that connects the moment before to the moment after. People (and more mysterious beings) grow from the ground like spring flowers, or morph into and out of being according to the opaque inner logic of this baffling world. The battle, in some of the clay-goriest claymation I've ever seen, features different races of beings competing for - well, I'm not quite sure.

I'll come back to this brilliant short again and again, and expect to see something new in it each time. Perhaps parts of the visual style don't wholly suit my tastes - they don't have to. An event like this must be taken on its own terms, and richly rewards the viewer who can do so.

8285353,5,B001BZIZ0A,Where else can you get stop motion claymation of this caliber?  The film is short but in reality it had to take Mr. Bickford many years to produce it. What a gift!,1268438400,,163,4.09375
8285354,5,B001BZIZ0A,"I can't believe it took so long to release this movie! The animation is astounding- it all flows together but is completely unpredictable. It's like Bickford is tapping into a whole world the rest of us can't see.
I was expecting a straight forward telling of the story of Prometheus- instead he twisted modern ideas into the landscape and created something new. It's amazing to think that animation used to be created in such an intense way- it makes it seem so much more personal.",1215388800,6,482,4.682352941176471
