8026092,1,B0002CPBIC,"I got a copy of this at the 99 Cents Store. I will refrain from complaining about having paid too much for the dreadful, dreadful DVD, in an effort to possibly warn others against attempting to watch this poorly made film. Please do not be fooled by the cover; obviously, the cover artist had nothing to do with this project -- i.e., he or she appears to have some talent. Everyone else associated with the film undoubtedly does not -- this includes the lead actor (so dull, uncharismatic and unable to carry a film, you will inevitably wonder how he got the roll), the director (hope he never gets a chance to make another film again, amen -- yes, that was actually a prayer), and all the supporting actors (clearly, none of whom are actually real actors, just cousins, relative of someone; they all had some free time on their untalented hands). The story is stupid, convoluted and not worth the investment of interest. It looks bad -- very poorly shot, is poorly plotted -- to say the least, and feels as if it was written by an amateur screenwriter under the influence of some pretty serious drugs. Bad, bad, bad! And bad again! Please avoid this one, for your own good! This is, without exaggeration, the worst film I have seen in a very, very long time. And I should add, it is not bad simply because it had a low budget; that is forgivable, understandable even. It is bad because that budget, despite how minimal it was, was completely squandered on a sloppy, ultimately pitiful project. Very, very poorly done; everyone associated with this garbage should be ashamed of themselves. There is no excuse for a movie being this bad, this poorly done! It is so bad; it will make you angry for considering it. It should not be available on this site! Again, bad, bad, bad! (PLEASE NOTE: Any positive reviews that may appear for this film will be false and insincere -- they will no doubt be planted by people related to the project in some way. So do not heed them: Avoid this Film!)",1304640000,,1985,4.532033426183844
