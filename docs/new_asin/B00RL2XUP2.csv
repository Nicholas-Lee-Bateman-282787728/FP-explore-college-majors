6931898,5,B00RL2XUP2,"I saw this in the theater, and I was impressed by both the true story and how well it was told--the scenes and acting are very well done, this was the first time I have been able to form a clear image of the Japanese era in Taiwan when my grandparents came of age. Even people like me who are not into baseball will enjoy the movie. The story of how the young players and their coach, from different groups in Taiwan--Aboriginal, Han, Hakka and Japanese, came together as a team to overcome great challenges both on and off the field is inspiring and moving.",1444348800,3,558,4.3238095238095235
6931899,5,B00RL2XUP2,"The most underrated of director Wei Te Sheng's films -- perhaps for no reason apart from the fact that it is set in Taiwan while it's under Japanese rule.  Everything that makes Wei Te Sheng's movies uniquely impressive is present in this movie: the masterful use of language, costumes, and set designs to recreate what it's like to live in Taiwan during the particular time period, as well as the use of amateur actors (numerous college and high school baseball players, in this case) to bring a feeling of authenticity to the film.  This film further combines the epic scale of Seediq Bale (""Warriors of the Rainbow, Wei's previous work) with the humor and tenderness of Wei's breakout film, Cape No. 7.

This movie is based on the real story of a multi-ethnic / multiracial (comprised of Formosan Aborigines, Han, and Japanese students) college baseball team that touched and inspired Japanese & Taiwanese baseball fans both then and for generations to come.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in baseball, good sports movies, or Taiwanese history!",1444089600,2,1058,5.0285714285714285
6931900,1,B00RL2XUP2,"Technically, it's just one clich after another.  Historically, this movie is nothing but a shameful reflection of how much some of today's Taiwanese appreciate their great grandparents' Japanese masters during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan between 1895 and 1945.  As a Taiwanese, I'm totally disgusted!!",1442793600,2,307,5.8

6931902,5,B00RL2XUP2,"A movie based on a true story. It gives you a slice of Taiwan history during the Japanese occupation in the late 20's to early 30's. The movie focused on a high school baseball team named KANO, a tri-ethnic team composed of: Taiwanese, Aborigines, and Japanese players. This was un-heard of during that period because almost all the baseball teams in Taiwan and Japan were made up of exclusively Japanese players. The movie was a bit slow at the beginning, but it builds up towards the last half of the movie where it draws you in with emotion that you can't help but cheer for the KANO team. A wonderful baseball film to watch with your family.",1430006400,3,645,4.521367521367521

8695482,3,B00RL2XUP2,"This film is like Japanese baseball manga - all plot, no character.  And that's a shame because the film _could have_ been so much more.  There is almost no investigation of the backgrounds of any of the players, no exploration of the political, economic and social disjunctures of a Japanese speaking baseball team in occupied Taiwan.  Instead, it's all about discipline, team work, loyalty, and determination.  These are not unworthy themes, but they've been done before in other sports films. This one tries far too hard, with an intrusive, cloying score and heavily saturated images.  For a lengthier treatment of these issues, see Tsui's review in the Hollywood Reporter.",1456531200,,676,5.165137614678899
8695483,2,B00RL2XUP2,"Kano is based on a real story, but almost nothing in the movie seems real. Pros: Overall, the film looks good. My favorite scenes were the ones showing some of Kanos training techniques, and the ones with Sos grandmother. Also, the stadium in Koshien looked authentic. It tells a worthy story. Cons: The plot is diffuse. For example, we have Yoichi Hatta suddenly appearing (this is chronologically inaccurate), disappearing and reappearing. The characterization is too thin. For example, we learn almost nothing about the family background, relational context or specific motivations of the Kano players. We actually learn more about Joshiya-the Hokkaido pitcher used in the unsuccessful framing device-than we do about most, if not all, of the Kano players. The portrayal of the coach has been praised as masterful, but I disagree. I suppose he is supposed to be stoical, but stoical would have been an improvement. For most of the film, he seems barely alive. He has two modes, loud miserable and obnoxious and silent miserable and obnoxious. Even at the end, there isn't much of a difference. When he says that he loves baseball, it sounds like hes being forced to say something under torture. The condescending way he treats his wife and daughters is inexcusable. The story is full of clichs. I was constantly being reminded of previous films. For example, the championship game was too much like the 2011 Korean film Perfect Game. The baseball scenes were passable, but not uniformly good. For example, the baseball scenes in the Taiwan tournament seemed choppy and unrealistic. The score is intrusive and overwrought. Maybe the cloying musical interruptions were why the coach was so miserable. Maybe the biggest problem was the dialogue. Almost nothing anybody said seemed real, except for Sos grandmother. The characters seemed to be intoning speeches because the script called for it, rather than communicating. The tacked-on scene on the ship looked and sounded fake. Finally, probably like this review, the film was way too long. I would recommend the light-hearted 2002 Korean film, ""YMCA Baseball Team instead.",1452038400,3,2124,5.1773255813953485
8695484,5,B00RL2XUP2,"I love this film, it has authentic portrait of Taiwanese society in 1931,  I watched this on Netflix.  It is a very moving, very touching film.",1451606400,,143,4.461538461538462
