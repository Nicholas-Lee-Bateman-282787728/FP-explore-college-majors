3920574,4,B002EZLO0Y,The photography in this documentary is outstanding. Blue ray and HD were made for features like this. I was a little disappointed however with the narration. The level of writing was not as good as the photography and at time seemed a little monotonous. That spoiled the series a bit for me somewhat.,1258329600,,300,4.679245283018868
3920575,4,B002EZLO0Y,"The visuals on this documentary are beautiful, exceedingly so, and this is both a plus and a minus. I got the feeling at times that the editors were torn between making an educational documentary and a beautiful set of moving images.
Maybe I'm being unfair, but this pales in comparison to the BBC documentaries like Planet Earth. I was particularly disappointed with the commentary for the most part as it seemed halting and poorly strung together.
Having said that however I like the fact that the series is based on half hour segments and it is indeed a spectacular visual treat.",1256256000,6,582,4.772277227722772
3920576,1,B002EZLO0Y,"This 3 disc blu-ray collection appeared impressive...well pricewise....
However Water Life (to me) is quite a dissapointment.......having been captivated by the BBC Planet Earth on Blu-Ray perhaps I was expecting too much. Water Life is not a BBC production....far from it....
In High Definition the pictures are ""pretty"" ...lots and lots of aerial shots, and if this was to receive a rating in the animal world, there'd be an X for the sex scenes....animals birds and reptiles copulating. The titles and there are plenty appear to be in spanish...the narration....maybe I'm wrong but the narrator who has clear and crisp english delivery sounds Japanese. The narrative text....mistakes...does the Amazon River hold 15 percent of the world's water...or should it be 15 percent of the world's ""fresh"" water? Also a doubtful fact. Occasionally there are obvious mistakes in other parts of the text....maybe the audio engineer did not understand english well enough for a final control. There's not so much scientific fact...the text appears to have been full of words, often stating the obvious. Look around for the ""big deals"" on BBC Blu-Ray discs......give Water Life a miss...I wish I did.

3920577,5,B002EZLO0Y,"Don't hestitate to buy this DVD. Much, much better than Planet Earth. Beautiful and stunning image. I owned Blue Planet, Coral Sea Adventure, Planet Earth, Animal Amazing Event but this one is the best.",1253059200,5,202,4.970588235294118
3920578,4,B002EZLO0Y,"I was excited for the ""Water Life"" release, as there are few long format documentary series focusing primarily on aquatic cinematography available on Blu Ray, with the exception of some single titles (Discover, Planet Earth, NatGeo).  That being said, the production, though commendable and ambitious, does not live up to the grandeur of the BBC produced nature docs, which I would consider the standard.  They do however use them as a model, excluding any footage of scientists in the field, talking heads, animation, etc, which I find to be a unwelcomed fluff in most Discovery Channel and Natgeo wildlife products.  The series is produced by CIN-TV (Caribbean International Networks) and co-sponsored by a range of conservation organizations, so the message tends to lean strongly towards environmental responsibility and protection more so than biological behavior or analysis.

A great deal of the footage of wildlife is shot in (sometimes extreme) close-up.  Some of this aforementioned imagery is gorgeous and unique, and offers a visual treat in HD.  Shots of fish eyes, scales, amphibian skin, birds, etc, provide a certain amount of intimacy not often found in larger more sweeping surveys of nature on film.  It also allows the cinematography and editing to be a bit more abstract and creative by not limiting to perfectly framed shots and allowing sequences to play-out with more of a montage feel.  In my opinion there are bit too many time remapped shots however (specifically vistas and flowing water), which are not my favorite when used for any reason other than to convey purposeful time-lapse rather than for aesthetics reasons.

The narration is a bit uneven, and at times, strangely paced, without the cohesive editorial structure that BBC is so good at.  My guess is that it has been translated to English for this package, as the series most likely was originally produced in Spanish (though this is only speculation based on the CIN-TV and almost strictly Latin American credits).  This would account for narration lines that seem to repeat verbatim back to back at times, and descriptions and analysis that, though correct, are a bit off in word choice.  It should be noted that, very much to the discredit of the distributors (Questar) there are no subtitles.  This is a major packaging flaw, especially for a documentary, and one which could potentially be useful as an educational tool.  In my opinion, not including subtitles in a global documentary series is unacceptable and does a huge disservice to the directors and producers.  The blu-ray discs are mastered at 1080i, which can be noticeable at times, and there is some distracting banding on random deep ocean shots, where color mastering and compression are at fault, but overall the image quality is very clean and colors crisp and accurate.

Overall, this product is well worth viewing at the Amazon price, though I could not recommend it at the suggested retail price.  As a wildlife documentary  buff, I tend to be hyper-critical of the production values and intentions of a film.  I appreciate that this series exists at all, as the use of HD to actually create a planned purposeful program rather than to display pretty images is sorely lacking in the market.  Though the series does, understandably fail to reach the levels of productions from larger companies, I believe it has maximized its resources and potential to deliver something commendable.  This was not thrown together with found footage, gimmicky editing, and the lack of direction that plagues American television documentary titles.  Surely CIN-TV did not have the $10 million used to make BBC's ""Blue Planet"" or the $25 Million allowed for ""Planet Earth,"" yet their enthusiasm for the series and professional approach to the content is evident.",1251763200,64,3804,5.111470113085622

3920581,4,B002EZLO0Y,"This is not a BBC production which, in my opinion set the standard for nature programs.  'Water Life' is not quite up to BBC standards, but is still informative, interesting, and beautifully shot.  NOTE: This production focuses on WATER more heavily than on the LIFE within it.",1363737600,3,277,4.872340425531915
3920582,3,B002EZLO0Y,"I did some research on the three-disc Blu-ray set before buying it and learned this set only contains the first 14 episodes, along with the 26th ""making of"" episode. The kicker that makes this Blu-ray release extremely odd is the fact that the DVD release contains all 26 episodes. It even has the same cover art. Why the decision was made to only release part of the series to blu, while all of it made it to DVD, is beyond my understanding. Both the BD and DVD sets have been out for a few years (the existing Blu-rays even being re-released with DVD's and digital copies). Even foreign releases of this series to Blu-ray only contain these same 15 episodes, so if a complete set was planned I think it would have already been released. However, it would be nice if Questar released the remaining episodes to Blu-ray on two discs so owners of this set can complete their collection. Anyway, having some of the series is better than none of it.",1356220800,2,945,4.5
3920583,5,B002EZLO0Y,"Water life has so much to offer the viewers,yet it has been underrated. It appears that some reviewers have compared other series with similar contents in order to place there reviews but for me my review for the series is to set it aside from others as a separate work of water and its associates and  also considering what it has to offer to everyone.  The incredible quantity of creatures above, below and in hidden areas, that you will see in these programs each disc containing 4 episodes with great photography, is astounding. Everything is associated with water. You have  narration throughout the series that helps identify the types of water and the inhabitants that live there and also hours of wonderful wildlife scenes, nature treats,under the sea treasures and lots of precious moments of creature play and habits. There is much to learn in this 6 disc set ,the complete series. DVDS are in HD and surprisingly clearer than some blu-rays out there. We are watching mother nature in constant action with one of her most necessary elements for survival, water, even in  abundance and the lack of it. There's so much to learn about water in everything that needs, lives and is sustain by it and that really is a big part of the earth on which we live. I will not live long enough to experience in real time all that which I can enjoy and learn from Water life series over and over again. It is a gem, one of a kind set and should not be compared to anything else out there. It stands alone and was created to be different and special. I have found much more positives than negatives in the complete series and will be enjoying it again and again. It is a great set and  I am happy to have this in my wildlife collections.",1348185600,,1731,4.5
3920584,1,B002EZLO0Y,"First of all, most people that usually watch a documentary like this already know a few things about the theme, however, it is always great to be astonished by new information and images that are not a commonality. This series gives the impression that it was made to be screened at grade level science class, and even then most of the content may be too basic for the world we live in today.  Another thing is that the WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) is really not very well experienced with in-depth research on nature, actually it's a branch of the government, so can you really expect an environmental emphasis with break-through information? Probably not, an given this video, definitely not.  Try the BBC videos instead, and if you've exhausted those, then try some of the other, older BBC videos, those are still better and hold more interesting information.",1340668800,,865,4.877551020408164

3920587,2,B002EZLO0Y,"The impressive cover of this supposed documentary got me thinking this might be another ""Planet Earth"" at a much lower price, so I took a chance on it. Boy, was I ever disappointed and angry. The quality of the production isn't even close the the Planet Earth series; the narrative is simplistic and flawed (especially with it's constant focus on a biased and flawed view of the earth's environment). It's not well produced or written and seems to just jump around without a story line or interesting treatment of the topics in the titles. The environmental agenda pushed in this series just made me angry! I struggled to watch the episodes as they continued to pour out their propaganda into many of them! I'm not anti-environment, I'm just a sensible person who recycles, doesn't kill birds and animals for sport, uses water sparingly, drives a very high mpg vehicle, and tries to make my ""footprint"" on each as light as possible. But if the environmental propaganda is your thing, you may be able to stomach this disappointing series. I'm tired of finding most of today's science and environmental information (nature documentaries, etc.) laced with propaganda which is an unfair portrayal of the truth -- I was so angry at giving money to these idiots I had to return the series and get my money back! I should have read the reviews of the series by previous purchasers. I probably would have been given a ""heads up"" about making a purchasing mistake. I usually always read the Amazon reviews on things before I make a purchasing decision. When I find a 5 star rating by a dozen or more people, usually it means that the product can be trusted to be well done, accurate and fair, and a good investment. Because I failed to check the ratings first, I got burned. Fortunately, I was able to return it and get my money back. Don't waste your money!",1275350400,2,1849,4.674846625766871
3920588,1,B002EZLO0Y,"If you know that ""life needs water,"" ""water comes from clouds,"" and ""frogs skin requires moisture,"" then you won't have learned anything after watching this show.  The narration is full of banalities, generalities and common knowledge.

Although the pictures are beautiful, they don't often have anything to do with what the narrator is talking about.  Although you will miss the music if you turn off the audio, that's the only thing you'll miss.  The title is also misleading. The show doesn't confine itself to oceans, lakes, and rivers, but also examines life in the mountains and rainforests.

If you like hi-def pictures of water and animals, this is a great show; but if you want to learn something, this is not the movie for you. Instead, try David Attenborough's ""Blue Planet""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life-Special-Edition/dp/B001957A4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Planet: Seas of Life (Special Edition)</a>",1272326400,5,990,6.042857142857143
3920589,3,B002EZLO0Y,"The photography is incredible and the areas of our earth shown and well chosen.

But. . . as another reviewer stated, the narration is terrible.  They are showing us truly wonderful creatures and places and for the most part we are not told where or what we are seeing.

Also the music though nice is quite repetitive and drowns out the dialog such as it is.

Since the director/produces seem to want to tell their story about ""water"" instead of what we are viewing, I have a suggestion that they use subtitles containing the needed descriptions.  They could tell their story and we would be informed.",1271203200,,601,4.632075471698113
3920590,2,B002EZLO0Y,"To its credit, this documentary deserves a lot of credit for tackling a subject that is rarely treated so extensively in nature docs. Moreover, the makers of this film should be creditted for making episodes that cover, ostensibly, unusual habitats that would scarcely get mentioned in most docs, like water tanks.

But the biggest problem with this documentary series is the script. How would I describe it?

-Largely fact-free (maybe one out of ten statements have a nugget of fact in them; the rest is fluff)
-Distractingly hyperbolic
-Heavy use of hackneyed phrases and cliches
-Very non-specific about the subjects (locations and species are rarely identified)
-Excessive anthropomorphism of animals, and even inanimate objects.

So, if you are disposed to enjoy docs, you might like watching it despite the problems above. But odds are, you'll just be disappointed.",1270857600,4,871,5.297101449275362

Senator, I know Planet Earth. Planet Earth was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Planet Earth... Which is to say that while the visuals are terrific and look great in HD on the big screen, the script is dreadfully shallow. The Voice-over guy sounds like someone you'd hear when you're put on hold (""Your call is very important to us.  Please stay on the line..."") so he got grating mighty quickly.

3920596,2,B002EZLO0Y,"Having watched a few *GREAT* Nature productions from BBC - Planet Earth, Yellowstone, Galapagos, etc..
I was very disappointed with Water Life production.

GOODS - This Water Life productions have some good clips of wildlife not seeing anywhere. These are few in between, but if they got the shots, then it looks EXCELLENT. I think perhaps it's just from one very highly experienced cinematographer from the group. It's on par with BBC shots. I have been doing photography for 20+ years so I do know some rules of the trades. The narration was OK to me but at times seemed stretched out to cover 3 discs. That's about all the goods stuffs that I noticed after watching the Water Life series.

BADS - Where to begin? - These particular shots must come from a VERY INEXPERIENCED or porn director/cinematographer. Aerophotography clips are mostly shot from behind helicopter view - pulling away from the source landscape or mountain tops. This causes a dizzying headache, especially when they add speed/fast forward. Time Lapse photography shot of sceneries that they also PAN at the same time adds to ridiculous headache. I have never seen BBC PAN a Time Lapse shots for obvious reason. The good thing I can say about some of these clips is that it's short. Otherwise people would quit watching after a few minutes. Then there are LOTS of scenes/clips at close-ups of just different animal's feet/legs walking or running around - what the HELL is the point??? Also, I seemed to notice this trend in almost all shots with animals in a scenery - the animal(s) just walks or runs out/off the picture frame completely. You are left with looking at nothing. Then, they finally cut away. This brings up the next problem - they cut away to completely different scenes a lot of times - this makes it very choppy & confused as to what's going on (ex: birds to plants to snow to trees). There's NO rule of 3rd in photography whatsoever. A lot of the time the rule of 3rd applies to the butt of the animals - then as you would have guessed, the animal walks completely off the picture frame. A lot of the shots are just pictures of animal's butts right into the lens! If I have to take a guess, one of these cinematographers is from the PORN industry (full animal copulations, feet/legs fetishes, butt shots of animals...etc). Lastly, this is supposed to be HD quality, yet, there are plenty of Out of Focus clips that I can't tell what it is because it's sooo close-up. Then there are the outer space clips from the 70's that they put in. What? NASA does not have updated HD clips of outer space??? Even Google Map looks better.

Well, this was my entry in the $20 arena for complete set of Nature Documentary. For the price, you can't ask for more. At least I didn't pay $25 for just 1 episode/disc at BB.
Stick with BBC Nature series, as they have the EXPERIENCED TEAM with many decades of work to put together a show for you to watch/enjoy. I would definitely pay more for the BBC series.",1264291200,2,2979,4.585365853658536
3920597,4,B002EZLO0Y,"BBC has set the bar incredibly high and Water Life is not Planet Earth or Blue Planet...very different type of Blu-Ray experience.  That being said, the video quality is amazing, I'd say it's actually the most beautiful Blu-Ray disc I own.  The detail seen in the macro shots are stunning, and as mentioned by others, presents some quite artistic shots.  My two biggest complains are as follows:

1. Not enough time spent on the subject being filmed.  The flow of the scenes are very scattered and they seemed to jump from one beautifully filmed scene to another...I found myself wishing they could stick to one subject, rather than showing 10 second clips (sometimes less) of a bunch of random creatures that fit in the particular subject being discussed.

2.  That brings me to my second big complaint...the narration is brutal.  I have been watching nature documentaries since I was three, now almost thirty (and yes, I am serious, George Page in Nature and Marty Stouffer in Wild America) and I know tons about nature/animals, and pretty much this narration seemed ""dumbed up"".

So in conclusion I still rate this four stars because the film-makers captured wonderful images of unique creatures (like I said, very different than Blue Planet) but there definitely is room for improvement.  Had those issues had been different, I would have actually rated it in the same league as the BBC films.",1263600000,,1397,4.906382978723404
3920598,1,B002EZLO0Y,"This is a very disappointing production.  As other reviewers have said, it definitely is far below the quality of recent BBC productions.  In fact, very far below those lofty standards.  If you collect the several criticisms that have been posted on this, they are all correct.  First, unless you know very little about natural history, you will learn nothing from these programs.  I would not say the the narrative is error-prone, as in the narrative in some PBS Nature productions, it is just simple-minded and hard to listen to for any length of time.  In one episode, on fresh water, you will flip from shots of tropical animals to a temperate stream, with no apparent reason.  This is typical- you will be flipped from clip to clip in a sequence that may have been random!  Much of the source material was very low quality, but most of it was very good, in fact.  It is what the film editors did with these clips that boggles the viewers.  Invariably, time motion is jerky and interrupted, so that, in panning landscape shots in particular, there is no smooth motion at all.  At first I thought that this was related to digital artifacts (and there are many of those), but no, this was intentional.  If you see a good clip (and there are many), you will have only about one second at most to watch it, before you are flashed to something else.  Whoever put this together may have had a background in ""creative video editing,"" but clearly no evident appreciation for the thoughtful observation of nature by a viewer.  One would think that the theme of water movement and its impact on various ecosystems could be the basis of a meaningful production, but this one is very hard for me to watch.  Maybe other people process visual information differently than I do!  Anyway, for awesome productions see BBC productions on the Galapagos, Planet Earth, and most of the Yellowstone production.  I really enjoy watching those, as much as I find this water series difficult to enjoy.  Good natural history video?  It starts with outstanding cinematography, but also requires excellent research and thematic focus on scripts, and careful film editing to preserve the special art of this medium.
