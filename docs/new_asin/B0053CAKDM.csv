8455085,3,B0053CAKDM,"This Italian Spaghetti western was originally entitled ""I vigliacchi non pregano"", ""A taste of Vengeance"" in the US, and ""El Vengador del Sur"" in Spain. This is a good example of the many mid class Spaghetti westerns when you compare them with Corbucci's Django and Leone's trilogy about the man with no name.

Story: a man (played by Gianni Garko) gets mad after the rape and murder of his wife by renegade Union deserters somewhere in Texas. No longer a believer in justice he turns against his rescuer (played by Ivan Rassimov, aka Sean Todd). Garko gets crazier and behave as a savage against the few good people around him. Overall, the story seems unusual in that Garko do not dedicate his life to look for the murders of his wife. However, the acting and the logic behind the story line lose credibility in my view. So, this should be a slightly under the average film in its kind (between 2.5 and 3 stars).

Technically, the region 2 DVD transfer by Impulso Records is very good. The image is crisp clear, with nice colors, and comes in nice widescreen format. The audio comes in French or Spanish. Subtitles will show automatically if you choose the Spanish audio as some sequences lack the Spanish audio, not an issue to me. What might be an issue for some Spanish speaking people is that of cowboys speaking Spanish from Spain, a bit awful detail. The film runs for about 96 minutes.",1423958400,,1394,4.616935483870968
