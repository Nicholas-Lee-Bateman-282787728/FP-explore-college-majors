8069418,5,B0009XBQZQ,"This is a terrific video, great for taking tension out of neck, back and shoulders at the end of a long day of desk work.  Highly recommended.",1356393600,,142,4.2592592592592595
8069419,5,B0009XBQZQ,"This is my favorite yoga program - relaxing, soothing, perfect at the end of a long day.  Her stretches are great for neck and shoulder tension (e.g., from working at a PC all day). Highly recommended.",1356393600,2,201,4.583333333333333
8069420,1,B0009XBQZQ,"This video almost put me to sleep, but only because it was extremely boring.  I expected something more than just some calming talk.  We watched it once, and I don't see using it again.",1326326400,,185,4.411764705882353
8069421,5,B0009XBQZQ,Ann takes you through a series of stretches with a chair followed by a lying down meditation. She has a very soothing voice and the DVD is quite relaxing and sleep-inducing. I definitely recommend it for winding down before bed.,1300147200,2,228,4.725
8069422,5,B0009XBQZQ,"I have a stressful job and lifestyle and really appreciate the depth of sleep I now have by doing some light exercise in the evening then listening to the CD and going through the relation process before going to bed.  It takes a few nights to get into the rhythm, then you look forward to the practice.",1276732800,3,303,4.315789473684211
8069423,3,B0009XBQZQ,"I like the instructor on this DVD.  However, I would not rate this DVD as a ""must have"".  If you have other gentle, restorative yoga DVDs, this is basically along the same lines.  There are many gentle yoga DVDs that leave you feeling calmer and more centred.  This is one more of the same.  Good, but nothing new really.

As with other Iyengar yoga DVDs, there is lots of reliance on props.  I myself prefer hatha yoga or kripalu, as I find always having to grab a pillow, chair, or blanket, etc. and postion them ""just so"" to be a bit disruptive.  But it's typical Iyengar yoga, if that's something you like.  I hate to say it, but the memory foam mattress pad I bought for my bed was a better investment towards greatly improving my sleep.  That, along with my other favourite restorative yoga DVDs.",1146528000,22,802,4.431506849315069
8069424,5,B0009XBQZQ,"This is an exceptionally nice dvd/cd set, and an effective tool for insomnia.  Ann Dyer's intelligent, yoga-educated personality comes through. She makes what is, essentially, an Iyengar forward bend practice, accessible to a yoga neophyte, without diluting it.",1142726400,9,261,5.868421052631579
8069425,5,B0009XBQZQ,"This workout is so awesome, so totally awesome and peaceful! I gave it a try last night right before bed, and my body felt such peace, such calm and serenity. After the workout, I didn't bother putting any of my stuff away. I put on harp music on my CD player and plopped right into bed. I slept so peacefully and heavenly. Today it's Monday. Normally I would feel a little grumpy, but not today. I feel at peace with myself. I want to purchase more restorative yoga workouts. This one is the best, hands down!!",1139184000,15,511,4.333333333333333
8069426,5,B0009XBQZQ,"Trouble getting to sleep at night? Instead of reaching for pills, try the Zyoga program (The ""Z"", of course, is the buzz of your yoga induced snoring).  The package includes two discs.  The DVD (illustrated and expanded by a 25 page booklet) demonstrates an accessible 40-minute asana-based-stress-release sequence for calming the brain at bedtime, and simple but useful breathing techniques for getting back to sleep after one of those unwelcomed middle-of-the-night wake-ups. The accompanying 25-minute CD consists of guided relaxation and a haunting ""yogic lullaby"" sung by Dyer herself. Dyer is a near-perfect sleep guru, her instructions clear and skillfully detailed, yet imaginatively engaging, her voice (both speaking and singing) amazingly soothing.  I'd like to say more here, but I'm feeling a little zzzzzzz.........",1131148800,24,829,5.669354838709677
8069427,5,B0009XBQZQ,"The yoga practice in this DVD is about 35 minutes long and uses a chair, a wall, and 2 blankets.  The poses are all restorative and held for a few minutes each.  Ann Dyer is down to earth with lots of reminders to not force the poses.

The DVD has menu options for the the yoga practice (includes savasana), savasana by itself, and an instructional section on conscious breathing to help you return to sleep if you wake up during the night.

The DVD comes with a nice booklet with asana instructions and photographs. There's also an audio CD that's included that has a 22 minute guided relaxation to be used before sleep.

I found the practice extremely relaxing.  I hope Ann Dyer makes more DVDs.",1121040000,29,697,4.492063492063492
