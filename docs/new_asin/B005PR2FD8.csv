4857304,1,B005PR2FD8,"After all the bad stuff the creator of Tekken said about the live action movie (I liked) as a fan I expected this to be amazing and it looks amazing but that's all you will get from it. The story is weak the choice for the character is questionable and once again the story what were they thinking by the end you will be like what and what. The main problem is they tried to give it a unique story and it turns into a cheap anime movie.

The Good
Looks amazing
Alice vs Ling Xiaoyu fight amazing
Jin Kazama vs Heihachi Mishima vs Kazuya Mishima fight truly amazing

The Bad
The Story so Bad Broken I won't go in to details but you will see.
The lack of characters
The questionable main characters.
It turns in to Naruto at the end with Devil Jin vs Devil Kazama and after the more ridiculous Devil Jin vs Heihachi Mishima empowered by the legendary spirits of the Mokujins as a Giant Monster no joke.",1322524800,7,900,4.226744186046512

4857314,4,B005PR2FD8,"...but it's also really freakin' weird.
 I've been a long time fan of the Tekken games and even enjoyed the two previous movies (for the most part).  This to be honest though is actually more of a drama.  There are some seriously weird plot holes and things that just aren't explained, but a lot of Tekken fans will understand it overall.
There are 3 main things I didn't like about this movie:
Very few characters from the games (it's missing my favorite character- Law!)
A lack of action (long drawn out scenes of drama/humor)
And the fact that you really have to have played through the story and brawler modes for Tekken 6 to really understand it.  And I couldn't get through either.
I thought the animation was amazing, the music was great, and the action sequences were absolutely incredible.  I really liked the main characters too, but their story was rendered almost completely pointless towards the end!
I'm still giving it 4 stars, but I say approach this one with caution.  Especially Tekken fans.",1392595200,,1009,4.7371428571428575

4857316,3,B005PR2FD8,"I bought this because I love Tekken.  This,  however,  was more soap opera than Tekken.  There is very little fighting to break up the drama.  The animation is vey good, make no mistake,  but don't buy this if you're looking for an action-packed fighting romp.  It simply is not,  and I can't see why Namco went this direction with it.",1380412800,,335,4.466666666666667

4857318,4,B005PR2FD8,"100x better then the live action film the preceded it but not all characters from the games history is shown. Showing that fillers don't need to be made just to get screen time for specific characters, this has a great story and execution for the film.",1374796800,,252,4.5
4857319,5,B005PR2FD8,This movie is the most best fighting movie I have seen in entire life. The other Tekken movie before this sucks. This Tekken blood vengeance meets my expectations. It was so great that I watched it twice.,1373673600,,204,4.54054054054054
4857320,5,B005PR2FD8,This must be anime because it resembles the style of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children which I love to death!,1373587200,,110,4.55
4857321,4,B005PR2FD8,"Overall I'd say the movie was alright. It had some parts that I didn't like such as how Devil Jin looked. But the main thing I was disappointed by in the movie was it featured Alisa but not Lars. The two go together like hot chocolate and marshmallows (cheezy comparison I know). This is not to say I disliked Xiaoyu but I would have rather seen Lars and Alisa kicking butt and making the story flow (like in Tekken 6).
If you're a Tekken fan you might like this film but it does venture away from the games a bit. In comparison to the live action Tekken film (which was disowned) this movie is amazing.

Most liked - Panda's personality (comical and still protective of Xiaoyu), Alisa (she's one of my favorite characters in the games), Lee's mansion and voice (comic relief with all the action going on)

Least Liked - lack of Lars (he's my favorite male character in the series), Devil Jin's appearance (to me it looked more like Ogre/True Ogre not like Devil Jin)",1365206400,,967,4.4576271186440675
4857322,2,B005PR2FD8,"This movie isn't all that great. The story is hard to follow, and doesn't make much sense even if you've played the game. The aminamtions are really good, but are a bit off sometimes. The  humans look stiff and movement at times doesn't really look all that great. I also hate the fact that the movie wasn't in HD. The copy I was received was in 480p. Overall, I really don't recommend buying this. Whatch it somewhere else for free.",1360972800,,433,4.4125

4857326,5,B005PR2FD8,"Tekken is one of my favorite video games and in the 90's the first movie ""Tekken"" came out and was awesome as a drawn cartoon video. This movie is so awesome, the characters look so real and the story goes right along with the Tekken games.  GET IT!",1356739200,,249,4.1875
4857327,4,B005PR2FD8,"I'm a big Tekken fan, but fell off the train some time after Tekken Tag Tournament 1. When I heard Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was being released, I had to get it, but I wanted to catch up on the story and new characters first. One character in particular stood out to me as particularly interesting - Alisa Bosconovitch - and a friend of mine recommended I watch this movie since she's basically the main character.

I'm really glad I did! There was so much to love about the movie, and it really drew me back into my Tekken fandom by reminding me just how good the characters really are, and how deep and interesting the world of Tekken is. It certainly whet my appetite for Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

First off, the animation in this film is absolutely gorgeous. The bright colors, the lighting, and the fluid movements and loving detail in each character is astounding. The film is really a treat for the eyes. Whether it's a simple conversation between two characters, or one of the film's astounding fight scenes, it's really just a pleasure to watch, even on a standard DVD.

Speaking of the fight scenes, I really have to give special mention to them. They are AWESOME. They really capture the feel of the Tekken series - helps that all of the moves used in them are straight out of the game - and are brilliantly exciting and animated to perfection. There is one in particular, near the middle of the film, that had my mouth agape. So well-done. It's worth watching the movie just for that, in my opinion.

Of course, it helps that the plot of the movie is quite interesting. Yes, it requires foreknowledge of the Tekken storyline, and when I first watched the film I was confused as to why certain things seemed to come out of nowhere. However, on a second viewing after I had caught up on the series' story, I was impressed with the amount of foreshadowing and callbacks to the game there were. I will say that parts of it do require accepting the ""scientific"" explanations at face value, but I had no problem suspending my disbelief and there was nothing that really pulled me out of the illusion too badly.

As for audio, I can't comment on the English dub, but the Japanese voicework is great, with Alisa especially sounding adorable and ranged. The music as is to be expected of the Tekken series is fantastic, fitting the atmosphere of scenes to a T.

I've heard complaints that the film isn't action-oriented enough, or focuses too much on the ""high school drama"" between Alisa and Xiaoyu. If anything, I felt this was one of the movie's biggest strengths. Tekken's world is populated with fantastic characters, so it was nice to see many of them get their due. Lee in particular was one of the film's biggest standouts, and this film really made me love the character. The fact that the fight scenes were kept far apart from each other made each of them that much more special, and as said before they were impeccably choreographed and animated.

Of course, this film isn't perfect. The story may be a bit confusing to some, especially if you're not a fan of the series, and your enjoyment of the film really depends on your enjoyment of the characters. As someone who really likes the characters they chose to focus on, I had a blast, but other fans may not be so kind towards it.

All in all, I thought it was a great film - one that triumphantly defies the accepted notion that movies based on videogames are terrible - and am pleased to have it in my DVD collection. Gorgeous animations, likeable characters, and an interesting story all tied together to make an entertaining romp I would watch again and again. Check it out.",1352160000,3,3642,4.549618320610687
4857328,4,B005PR2FD8,DVD game in good condition for used and gives good playback. I recommend buying it as a Tekken fan and the fact that it's a good deal.,1351641600,,134,4.0
4857329,2,B005PR2FD8,"Positives:
- I thought the CGI was quite good all things considered. If you really like CGI, it's probably worth watching just for the eye candy. The facial expressions are a little robotic and they can't seem to do wet characters (people standing in the rain, looking perfectly dry for some reason). But overall, good I thought.
- Voice acting was good.

Negatives:
- The plot is so ridiculous you give up trying to follow it about 15 minutes in. FFVII Advent Children had a much more cohesive plot by comparison.
- For a fighting movie, it's more than 50% teenage girl angst. No joke. Fight scenes are ok, but not as good was I was hoping.
- The ""lesson"" is really heavy-handed and trite. Humans shouldn't fight each other. Revenge is destructive. Respect the earth. Etc.

Verdict: This is a straight up terrible movie. Unless you're really bored, or really love CGI, don't bother.",1338249600,3,883,4.690322580645161
4857330,3,B005PR2FD8,"This film takes place between Tekken 5 and 6 and basically informs us on how Heihachi returned to the tournament.

4857331,1,B005PR2FD8,"This movie is just bad, really bad. If you have no knowledge of the franchise prepare to be lost, in fact even with knowledge of the franchise  you will be lost.

The story is unintelligible, making the Super Mario Bros. movie look amazing by comparison. The animation is bad, the humans look way to stiff at so many moments you'd think they were robots. It's a bad movie by bad filmmakers, avoid in all costs.",1336089600,3,410,4.453333333333333
4857332,4,B005PR2FD8,"Ah, those days in college, playing ""Tekken"" on the PSX until my thumbs would be in pain and thinking that the game was the best fighting game on the planet!

But I know I'm not alone when it comes to being one of the many fans who grew up playing and still are playing ""Tekken"".

The Bandai video game series which began in 1994 has always pushed the limit in fighting video games and we have seen six incarnation of the game for the major consoles, a Sony PSP version of the game as well as a ""Tekken Tag"" version.

And one thing that ""Tekken"" had always done so well was seeing Namco trying to make an awesome looking 3D game, giving its characters their own fighting style and gameplay that rivaled other fighting game competitors, including CAPCOM's ""Street Fighter"" fighting game series (a rivalry that will lead to the upcoming ""Tekken x Street Fighter""/""Street Fighter vs. Tekken"" videogames).

But you have to give credit to Bandai for crafting a continuing storyline that revolved around the ruthlessness of the Mishima family which include the evil and dead (but manages to always come back alive) patriarch Heihachi; Kazuya, Heihachi's evil son with the devil gene who will do anything to destroy his father and Kazuya's son Jin, who also has the devil gene (but chooses to use his power to destroy his grandfather and his father).

Sure it sounds and reads quite wickedly and if you played the game, you can't deny of how this family is the ultimate in dysfunctional relationships.  Who can ever forget Kazuya Misushima grabbing his father and dropping him down a cliff?  Wicked, I tell you.

But if there was one thing that ""Tekken"" has not lived up to its video game series is its video releases.

The video games had cool stories but with each game, each character had a CG-storyline that lasted for a few minutes and fans wanted more!  Especially with ""Street Fighter"", ""Virtua Fighter"" and ""Final Fight"" receiving some anime love, ""Tekken"" would receive some love in 1998 as anime fans were treated with a lackluster animated film titled ""Tekken: The Motion Picture"", followed by a 2010 live-action film titled ""Tekken"" which even ""Tekken"" video game director Katsuhiro Harada had panned.  With a poorly done animated and live-action film, fans can only wish these two never existed.

Fortunately, Bandai Entertainment had always wanted to create a CG-based animated film since the release of ""Tekken 6' (for the PS3 and XBOX 360) and what they created was the CG animated-film titled ""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"", a storyline that actually will appeal to those who are familiar with the video game series.

The film was supervised by Youichi Mori (""Appleseed"") and written by Dai Sato (""Eureka Seven"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"").  In charge of animation production is Digital Frontier who created the sequences for ""Tekken"" 5 and 6.

And possibly the smartest decision made by Dai Sato was to not include every character in the ""Tekken"" universe but to focus on the characters that relate to the Mishima storyline: Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin  and Lin Xiaoyu.  And characters with storylines that have continued since the first video game: Spy Nina Williams and her enemy and sister, Anna but also the addition of the latest character, Alisa Bosconovitch (a robot created by Dr. Bosconovitch who has played a big part in the series storyline and his relation to other characters in the videogame).

""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"" will be released in the U.S. on DVD on November 22nd.  For those who want the Blu-ray release, will want to purchase ""Tekken Hybrid"" which contains the 3D Blu-ray version of the film, plus ""Tekken Tag Tournament HD"" and ""Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Prequel"" and was released on December 27, 2011.
VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"" is presented in 16:9 and is in Japanese and English Dolby Digital 5.1.  For an action film, as expected with this explosive storyline, you can expect a good round of explosions and destruction galore with the soundtrack.  And the picture quality is what one can expect on DVD.

While the CG looks fantastic and in par with the graphics of the ""Tekken 6' cut scenes, for those who are wanting to watch this in HD will have to purchase the PS3 ""Tekken Hybrid"" which contains the upcoming game ""Tekken Tag Tournament 2: Prologue"", ""Tekken Tag Tournament HD"" and ""Tekken: Blood Vengeance 3D"".

In fact, this film looks amazing enough that I would prefer to watch it in HD versus on DVD, especially since you get both ""Tekken Tag Tournaments"" for the PS3.

But for the DVD release, picture quality is good and as for the Japanese and English dub, I prefer the Japanese soundtrack as it syncs much better with the characters mouths.  But for those who prefer English, you do have the English dub as an option.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tekken Blood Vengeance"" comes with the film trailer and the trailer for the ""Tekken Hybrid"" PS3 release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"" is a film that definitely brings the storyline to the video game fans who have grown up with this series.  As the anime movie and the live-action film were made to be more accessible to those not familiar with the video games, I would imagine that ""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"" can be watched by someone not familiar with the series but at the same time, not feeling the impact compared to those who are familiar with the Mizushima families dysfunctional relationship.

As a fan of ""Tekken"", I can easily recommend this to fans because the storyline literally relates to the video games.  You can't help but be excited when you see Nina vs. Anna, Lin Xiaoyu vs. Alisa and of course, seeing Kazuya and Jin going against each other.  And there are also a few other short cameo appearances by a few other characters as well.

So, in terms of watching a film based on a video game, graphic-wise, I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"".  Mainly because I invested so much time in playing those games, you can't help but be excited.

The storyline is easy to follow when it comes to Lin Xiaoyu but when it comes to the Mishima family, I know there are viewers not familiar with the video games who will feel they are missing a chunk of storyline because they don't know the hatred between Jin and his father Kazuya and both towards their grandfather Heihachi.

And this is possibly one part of the release that  can be problematic for some.  For the release of ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"", to help viewers understand what had taken place beforehand, many of the CG animatics from the video game were included as a special feature and served as a wonderful primer to help people understand the film.

It would have been nice of Namco to include those CG clips as special features from the previously released video games, especially the cut-scenes regarding Heihachi, Kazuya and Jin.  So, I felt that was one missed opportunity for this DVD release (Note: I am not sure if the Blu-ray release will contain extra features not included on the DVD version), as it would definitely help non-fans or new fans understand what is going on and possibly get them interested in the video game series.

But for those who are fans of the video game series, I can personally say that the film was exciting and fun to watch.  Granted, if you are not fans of the Mishima clan, Nina Williams or Lin Xiaoyu, I can understand how those fans would be a bit bummed that there favorite characters were not fully featured.

But considering how I wished the video game cut-scenes were longer, to have 92 minutes of all story featuring these cool characters from ""Tekken"", I can't help but having this grin on my face because I enjoyed watching it.

And while the PQ and AQ were good for DVD,  I wish there were more special features on the DVD but who knows?  Perhaps the Blu-ray release may have extra features.  And the fact that the PS3 ""Tekken Hybrid"" release comes with the 3D version of the film and two ""Tekken Tag Tournament"" video games in HD, I wouldn't be surprised if the hardcore fans go for the Blu-ray release.  I definitely would!

Overall, ""Tekken: Blood Vengeance"" may not be for everyone as it is truly geared towards fans of the ""Tekken"" video game series, but if you are a fan, I definitely recommend watching the film!",1335571200,3,8329,4.753300903405142

The motion capture, graphics, compositing, animation, music were amongst the best I've seen; in a class with ""Adventures of Tintin"". Worth seeing the movie just for the visuals.
The story was written just well enough to sustain interest, but could have used more clarity.

The English subtitle translations seemed disjointed.
The various characters were not well presented. It resulted in a confusing potpourri of shallow and disconnected characters thus disrupting the flow and continuity of the storyline.",1335312000,,529,5.69620253164557

4857336,4,B005PR2FD8,"I was debating on giving this 3 instead of 4 stars, but, the more I thought about it, the more I realized the movie actually was pretty decent. The movie is 90 minutes, and, considering there are only like three fights, it can seem a bit dragged out or slow at some points. The 3rd fight can technically be split into 3, but, since it's between the same 3 charachers, I'm combining them into one. I really did enjoy the fights though. My biggest wish would have been to see at least a few more characters with a few more fights thrown in. With only 7 of them present, you pretty know who going to fight whom. Nina and Ana start the movie off with a battle, and it looked like they were going to have another showdown later in the movie...which they did.

But, when you see the plot, nonsense (e.g. Lee's catchphrase ""Excellent""), irrelevance of some things, and limited characters from the entire Tekken series, you realize that this entire movie is just incomplete. It is supposed to be much better than the real live action film ""Tekken"" made in 2010. But, it is honestly no different than that lousy and previous one (Jin and Christie are a couple in that movie but they are not even friends in the video game series.).

4857339,4,B005PR2FD8,"I'm not at all familiar with the Tekkenverse, and I'm only going on my friend's assurance that this film doesn't too much mangle the internal continuity of Namco Bandai Games video games. I'm recommending TEKKEN: BLOOD VENGEANCE, mostly for its dazzling CG animation. The story itself gets more muddled as it progresses, although, thankfully, enough coherence is retained. I was able to follow the plot, even though, at times, I did scramble to keep straight just who is who and which their respective allegiances. At its core, the narrative is constructed around a seriously messed-up family feud. The supernatural Mishima bloodline had always been prone to homicidal urges and wanton destruction. But those new to this universe may require a scorecard.

Powerful rival corporations use, respectively, a high school girl and a robot posing as a high school girl to infiltrate Kyoto's prestigious Kyogoku Academy to spy on a student rumored to hold the key to the M stem cell, the so-called Devil gene which unlocks paranormal talents and confers immortality. Teenager Ling Xiaoyu, an expert martial artist who rides a panda and looks cute in her standard schoolgirl outfit, is expelled from Mishima Polytechnic High School which then paves the way for the Mishima Zaibatsu company's brand of arm twisting. This leaves Ling's loyalties veering somewhere on the shaky side. It's even suggested that she goes along with the espionage ops only because the target, Shin Kamiya, is a good-looking hunk.

You have to credit the script writer(s) for dispensing with the fight tournament format, as that plot device is pretty played out when it comes to adapting video games to cinema. Instead, there is a ""story"" which does frame the fighty fights. The film's first half-hour dedicates itself to fun high school hijinks, with Ling Xiaoyu's snooping around qualifying as lighthearted caper. She befriends another girl, the naive Alisa Bosconovitch, who dresses like - to borrow one reviewer's neat description - a ""cosplay courtesan."" Alisa and Ling are soon vying for Shin's affections, although Ling's crush seems more half-hearted.

The story drops the high school shenanigans once Shin Kamiya is abducted during a school festival competition. It adopts a more somber tone. The two warring corporations - the Mishima Zaibatsu and the G Corporation - show their hand and deploy their forces. This leaves the outgunned Ling Xiaoyu caught in the crosshairs from all directions.

Again, TEKKEN: BLOOD VENGEANCE may be a bit daunting for those just entering the Tekkenverse. There's a lot of things thrown your way. In a good move, the writers opted to focus on only two protagonists (three, if you count Jin), even though plenty of Tekken characters pop up seemingly for the sake of a gratuitous cameo. Shin Kamiya, for one, feels like a gimmick, there only to advance the story and then disposed of. But Ling and Alisa are appealing protagonists and their friendship is really nicely fleshed out. What happens to one of them in the hell's broken loose third act makes for a surprisingly emotional moment. On the other hand, it's disappointing that Ling, in that same third act, is relegated to the sidelines, although, yes, logically, her skills set renders her pretty helpless in the face of the apocalyptic brawl. Yes, the film culminates in an epic three-way battle royale among the Mishima clan, all three of whom exhibit destructive supernatural aptitude. I'll say that this is possibly the best extended animated fight I've ever seen. Three generations of the Mishima bloodline just tore each other up! And just when I thought they couldn't top it, the Mokujin spirits of the Kyoto Castle are invoked and the stakes escalate that much more.

This film gratifies several fetishes of them anime geeks. Cute martial artist in schoolgirl outfit - check. Hot robot girl with transformable body parts (and a nifty jet pack) - ditto. Another hottie in tight black leathers springing into action - you betcha! Frequent salacious upskirt shots - yes! Oh, and let's not forget the refrigerator scene which has a toweled-only Ling cuddling with Alisa.

The story occasionally drags and baffles, but it's worth sticking around for the CG work and the remarkably rendered action sequences. I really couldn't care less about Ling's search for the kidnapped student and the resulting poking into the M cell conspiracy, but I did like the human touches, the interactions between our two heroines, and even the clichd plot device of the robot's developing a sense of humanity. And how can you not get hyped when the fate of the world ultimately rests on a wrecked robot's Skyrocket Super Punch?

And a final thing. May I suggest that you watch this with the Japanese soundtrack? The English dub lacks a little something.",1328486400,4,4801,5.061946902654867

4857341,5,B005PR2FD8,"Hello and welcome to my review. Between all the fighting games I have played, Tekken is number 1. First it was Tekken the motion picture, then the recent live action film, both great films. Here we have Tekken Blood Vengeance, did it succeed?
  The story is about a High School girl Xiaoyu who first appearence was tekken 3. She gets expelled and sent to another school located in Kyoto. As she is there, she bumps into a girl named Alisa Bosconovitch who is a human android, They hang around with this guy shin who they both happen to like, ahh a love triangle! In any case, Shin went to the same school as jin, It turns out shin has a rare gene that the mishima clan obtains. As the two beauties are having fun together, Shin gets kidnapped. As usual, Anna and Nina williams, our two lovely irish princesses are bickering. Xiaoyu spends most of her time traveling with the cute a furry panda. Xiaoyu and Alisa are both out to stop the Mishima clan from going to war, kinda similar to what Jun Kazama tried to do to Kazuya in Tekken the motion picture. In the end, the entire Mishima clan has a massive butt-kicking battle. Jin, Kazuya, and Heihachi are each fighting to own the devil gene. After Jin knocks Heihachi down, Jin and Kazuya unleash the devils within them. After Jin defeats Kazuya, Heihachi comes back with a giant mokujin, Jin defeats it. After Alisa's fall, Jin revives her and Xiaoyu and Alisa live happily ever after!
  So that pretty much sums it up. The special features include multiple trailers, the making, and an interview with the writer Dai Sato and Katsuhiro Harada. The visuals are terrific 10/10, Story 10/10, fights 10/10, english dub 3/10. A true tekken fan must have! All in all I give it two thumbs up. That's my review, Thanks for reading!",1324166400,2,1774,4.551724137931035
4857342,4,B005PR2FD8,This DVD didn't get any press release so when I saw it at Walmart I was very curious to know whether it's good or not.  I can tell you that the CG graphic and sound are awesome!  The central theme of the story is vengeance begets vengeance which is still a relevant point to our current global conflict.  I also like the fact that the DVD has two separate English and Japanese soundtracks.  The extra menu only have 2 trailers of the movie.  I wish they had included the making of the movie in the extras.  Overall I recommend this DVD.,1323216000,,536,4.257425742574258
4857343,3,B005PR2FD8,"Like the title suggests, this movie is purely for the fans. This option is also for the ones that either don't want Tekken Hybrid or have a 360 and don't really want to shell out 40 bucks for a blu-ray version of the movie. While the release has no features whatsoever, it's still a serviceable movie.

However, one of the things that really plagues the film is the English dubbing. Sure, Xiayou and Anna are pretty good, but the other voice actors either ham up their lines or phone them in, leading to many unintentionally humorous moments. The story is pretty odd, and while it does center around both Alisa and Xiayou, the whole film gets hijacked by the Mishima clan and bloodline (understandably so, since the movie is subtitled Blood Vengeance.)

The main spectacle is how pretty the film looks, even on DVD. The animation style is akin to the Final Fantasy CGI film, and is less bogged down by story. Although fans will recognize the conflicts between Jin, Heihachi, and Kazama, casuals will find something to enjoy in this movie.",1323043200,4,1038,4.697802197802198
4857344,5,B005PR2FD8,"If you're one of those guys that's really into graphics/quality when it comes to moving pictures or polygons, then this is one of those must-watch types of media. The animation is just outstanding... some of the most beautiful eye-candy you are ever going to see. It really gives Advent Children a run for their money. Animation might lack a few frames and look robotic at times, but overall it still looks sweet. It starts out with plenty of action, courtesy of the Williams sisters, then it moves onto drama... and then more EPIC Action! I am talking Matrix Revolutions-like... including the score. The movie might be quite silly and girly at times, but I think the action scenes do more than enough to deliver a solid feature.

The climax at the end... [SPOILERS!!!] is an EPIC battle between the Mishima clan. Three generations of the Mishima clan have one of the most epic CG battles that you're ever going to see, the only thing I did not like was the fact that Marshall Law... the best character in Tekken imo, was not included in the film.. shame. Still a good buy though, just make sure you see the 720p or 1080p versions.",1322870400,3,1131,4.599009900990099

8482608,5,B005PR2FD8,"The movie is made with high definition CGI animation; wish such graphics will be included in future Tekken games. Blood Vengeance presents an alternate storyline that transpired between the events of Tekken 5 and 6. As much alternations have been made in the movie without any mentions in the game series, it follows quite closely to the main series like Nina's working for Jin as her bodyguard and Anna working for Kazuya at G Corporation as his comrade.
Excellent movie overall. Highly recommended for Tekken fans to share this impeccable game film experience.",1454544000,,562,5.053763440860215
