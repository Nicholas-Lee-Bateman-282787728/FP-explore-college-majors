It is more like toys playing...not cartoon characters, was disappointed, and would like to know if and where Baby Looney Tunes are available on DVD...",1125964800,4,263,4.739130434782608
7976195,5,B00007G257,"I bought this video for my daughter when she was 5 months old. It appeared as though she was getting bored with Baby Einstein videos and I wanted to find her something new. Although she likes the Baby Einstein videos, she never laughed or smiled like she does when she watches this baby looney tunes videos. She seems to enjoy this much more even now at 7 months old. And this video is also much more enjoyable for the parents. The interaction between the baby looney tunes characters is adorable and the songs are all sung by children with very sweet voices. All in all....a great find!",1060646400,3,587,4.4953271028037385
7976196,4,B00007G257,Excellent tape for coaches of girls to watch and get ideas from. Many skills on the tape are achievable with practice for girls 6years and up. Tape could have been longer. World cup stars do make role models of themselves by not only teaching moves and backyard games but by relating thier growing up with soccer as kids and how it prepared them for higher competition. Tape uses kids what appears from 8-15 yrs old to show the beginning stages of learning moves. This might be the most benifitial aspect of the tape as taught moves are not mastered in a day. Tape does not emphasize the importance of warming up or stretching nor does it warn of the dangers of over training. All and all a great tape for a soccer coach to watch with his daughter.

7976197,5,B00007G257,"This is an excellent 'how to' video primarily aimed at young girls. The instructional format used is very clever, effective and fun to watch. Actual World Cup game footage is used to highlight basic fundamental soccer  moves as well as some very flashy 'fakes' and 'deeks' used by members of  the U.S Women's National Team. Next the moves are analyzed, explained and  illustrated in a back yard setting by the players themselves. This is not  your `run of the mill' soccer video.",945561600,,479,4.804878048780488
