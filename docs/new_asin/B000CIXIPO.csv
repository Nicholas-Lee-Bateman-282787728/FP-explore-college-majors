8099128,5,B000CIXIPO,This movie was one of those that I heard about and just had to watch. After a few clips I was sold. This movie has everything!,1331683200,,126,3.8846153846153846
8099129,4,B000CIXIPO,"This is not a movie review.  This is a purchase experiance review, which I have had trouble finding from many other people.  I purchased this through Source Media Group and was a little confused when I got the package.  The description on the product information page just said ""Battle Royale I and II.""  What I recieved was the 3-dvd box set.  The set is 2 dvd cases with 3 dvds inside.  On the outside of the boxes, one says ""Battle Royale,"" and the other says ""Battle Royale Supplement.""  I know that the second film's subtitle is ""Requium,"" so I was a little confused.  I was leery to open the boxes in case it was not the correct item, but did anyway and figured out that the first dvd case enclosed the first 2 films while the second box houses special features.  However, when I opened the first box, the dvds were not labeled I and II so I had to actually try them out in the dvd player to figure out which was which.  Overall, this was a bit of a confusing purchase, but worth what I paid for it.  The description could have been a bit more clear, though.",1306972800,,1064,4.27
8099130,3,B000CIXIPO,BR1 was not as good as the novel but they did squeeze in as much as they could into the movie.  BR2 was obviously created to capitalize on BR1's success but I couldn't really enjoy a war movie fought by 9th graders.  The actor playing their teacher was gross over acting.  The 3rd disc only had Korean subtitles and I didn't understand Japanese.  Buy BR1 and bypass the other two discs unless you're really die-hard fans.,1231200000,,421,4.5
