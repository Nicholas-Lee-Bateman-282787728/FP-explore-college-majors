8603624,2,B0000700KR,"I stumbled across this DVD in a supermarket for a few dollars and, being an admirer of Brendan Gleeson's work and a sucker for obscure UK comedies, decided to give it a spin.  The performances are somewhat variable, though generally earnest, especially Gleeson playing the self-loathing protagonist (celebrity chef/amnesiac... mmm, here come the contrivances), who is asked to do a lot-- that is, be alternately idle and introspective, loutish and likeable-- with some pretty thin material.  His scenes are certainly the best in the film, but even so most of the touching moments are less than heart-rending, and the comedy often falls just this side of funny.  The culprit, of course, is the screenplay, which tries to wrap all this conflicting characterization in a familiar, Hollywood-derivative plot whereby a sinner finds redemption via deus ex machina, in this case a severe beating that results in an amnesia-inducing coma (from which Gleeson emerges mentally as his 18-year-old self-- shazam!), while being haunted by the excesses of his past, embodied here by his idiotic job, his almost-ex-wife and neglected kids... oh, and a vengeance-seeking psychopath.  Not very subtle stuff.  So, if you can imagine successfully marrying the schmaltzy drama of 'Regarding Henry' with the low-brow humor of any of those body-swapping formula pictures that surface every few cycles ('Freaky Friday,' 'Like Father, Like Son,' 'Vice Versa,' 'The Change-Up,' etc.), you might want to check out 'Wild About Harry.'  If you're in the mood for something with a more sophisticated touch, I'm betting you'll be disappointed.  TVA Films' disc offers a clean print with clear audio, and is presented in full-screen format with no extra features.  A generous 2-plus stars, primarily for the efforts of the cast.",1304985600,2,1797,5.302816901408451
