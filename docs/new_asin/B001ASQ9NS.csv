3467064,5,B001ASQ9NS,Love it!  Hope they release all the episodes and I plan on buying all of the Uncut Boxed sets!,1234310400,,94,3.9473684210526314
3467065,5,B001ASQ9NS,Buy all the Naruto series. They are way too good to pass up. Most Anime is rather poor out there right now. This is the greatest available.,1231459200,,139,4.185185185185185
3467066,5,B001ASQ9NS,"I love all the Naruto seasons and the movies as well, but I must say that they def. stepped up the dramatics in this set! Tons of action that has you on the edge of your seat, along with funny scenes, but all and all it comes down to their ""ninja way"" really shining through. I can't wait for more!",1227139200,,298,3.9833333333333334
3467067,4,B001ASQ9NS,"This box set is one to have if you already own the rest of the 1-8 box set. In this box set, Sasuke betrays the leaf village. Sasuke is taken and the fight with the Elite sound five begins. This is one of the best battle scenes in Naruto.

3467068,5,B001ASQ9NS,"I love Naruto, and although we are now going into the suckiest arc of life, because of the ending of the arc, the animation and the fighting only get better from here.  This arc has some of the best fights in all of the original Naruto seris.  I just can't wait for the rest of this seris to come out and for Shippuden to begin.  Viva la Naruto!",1222992000,,345,4.044117647058823
3467069,4,B001ASQ9NS,"Nothing complex, it was kind of expensive, but it is worth it for a great season",1222646400,,80,4.0625
3467070,5,B001ASQ9NS,"My hubby and I love Naruto, we can't get enough of it. Amazon offers the best price for this DVD. We went to Japan and tried buying this same DVD and it's double the price. Can't get any better than this!",1221004800,,204,4.0
3467071,5,B001ASQ9NS,"Great series.  Not too happy about this one being more expensive than the previous eight sets for no reason, but still worth the purchase.",1220659200,,138,4.75
3467072,4,B001ASQ9NS,"Volume 9 of the Uncut Box Set stays true to form.  Everything from the previous box sets will be presented and displayed in pretty much the exact same ways containing 14 (mostly) filler free episodes over three discs in a 4x5x5 episode format.  It contains a storyboard book that gives storyboard sketches for an episode of the show.  Something similar can be seen in the extras on disc three, where they take eight scenes/pages from the storyboard booklet and play the animated scenes matching them.

The story for the disc essentially begins the Sasuke Retrieval arc of the story, the final arc before the manga took its hiatus and restarted several years later with Naruto Shippuuden.  Sasuke is finally too frustrated with his progress in Konoha. And when tempted by Orochimaru's bodyguards agrees to leave and seek his tutelage.

The next day when this is discovered, the village leader, Tsunade commands Shikamaru, and whatever shinobi he can find, to go and retrieve Sasuke.  He leaves with Naruto, Neji, Choji and Kiba and Akamaru.  So begins a long chase scene, where the Leaf shinobi face off with Orochimaru's Sound Four one by one to get to Sasuke.  While there is plenty of action, it is also tempered by the many flashback scenes.  When the characters come near death, we end up seeing EVERY scene they've ever been in.  And while it is somewhat understandable, seeing as this may be the last time these characters are seen alive, it is a bit too much.

Overall, I'd have to say that Viz did not drop the ball on this.  Any complaints I have are with the show's presentation, not the story or package design.  You get a lot of action packed drama filled episodes for a VERY good price.  If you've enjoyed the show up to this point you are not going to be disappointed, and I highly recommend it.",1218931200,4,1809,4.662460567823344
3467073,5,B001ASQ9NS,"I have seen these episodes and I was extremely moved and shocked.  Most of the characters face their demons and try to just survive.  I was saddened at the thought of these beloved character facing certain death.  The way they would risk their life's for a comrade that has gone missing.  It felt very natural and realistic, my bond with these characters was growing increasingly over these life-changing episodes that featured many mature themes that I thought this series wouldn't dare show.  The realization that life is so short, so unpredictable, so cruel, for these ninjas.  This box set should be on every Naruto fans DVD collection.  This volume will shock many and maybe haunt you.  This isn't just a TV show it's a journey.  If you have seen these episodes you know the contents aren't for the faint of heart.  If you are an avid naruto fanatic this box set is a must for you.  I own a few and let me tell you they are worth the money I paid and they are apart of my collection.  So if you are a fan this box set is a steal for just thirty bucks don't wait another minute purchase this Box Set.  Trust me this won't disappoint.",1218585600,10,1137,4.408653846153846
3467074,5,B001ASQ9NS,"None of the discs skipped, it was a complete set. It even came with a sticker and the episode guide and booklet!",1357516800,,112,4.136363636363637
3467075,5,B001ASQ9NS,"First of all, I would like to apologize if I spelled Sasuke's name wrong in the title of this review. Now, for the actual DVD Box Set, if you like Naruto, get it. It starts off with the epic of Sasuke leaving the Leaf for more power (Orochimaru) (I just butchered the spelling and I am sorry about that too.) However, if you want the rest of that, but Box Set 10 as well, that includes the rest of Naruto, Choji, Shikamaru, Neji, and Rock Lee hunt down Sasuke. Overall, it's a great product, that comes with the art booklet is collectible to certain extent.

3467079,5,B001ASQ9NS,"This is one of my favorite parts of the original Naruto series. It has all of the battles from the Sasuke retrieval arc in it, and these battles are definitely entertaining for any Naruto fan.",1309564800,,192,4.514285714285714
3467080,3,B001ASQ9NS,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 9 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and seven through one hundred and twenty of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto Uncut Box Set 10, which runs for roughly three minutes; it should be noted that the audio for the preview is mastered lower than the episodes on the disc.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and twelve.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled as ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, the Naruto manga, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for the Naruto: Ninja Destiny video game, the Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution video game, Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, Buso Renkin, Hunter x Hunter, and Death Note.

The special features are exactly what I expect after seeing the exact same things on the previous eight box sets; however, I still can't help but feel a little disappointed that Viz Media feels the need to have such ""cookie cutter"" extras included on these DVD box sets.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 9 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1274140800,,1895,4.601190476190476
3467081,5,B001ASQ9NS,"In the Naruto Uncut box set 9, everything revolves around the retrieval of Sasuke. It is one of the most action packed seasons full of intense battles and is something i would recommend to anyone who watches anime.",1264291200,,214,4.657894736842105
3467082,5,B001ASQ9NS,"This was the most awesomeness uncut dvd of anruto ever because there was so much cussing and bloody scenes and i personally think that the uncut version is the best on the earth and its very different then on tv. I really wish this was on adult swim first than stupid cartoon network, but the episodes were all awesome and so was the battles with the sound four!! 5/5 and worth buying",1251504000,,384,4.347222222222222
3467083,5,B001ASQ9NS,"The best out of the box series!  Here is where I gain my respect for Shigamaru (sp?).  Every battle was detailed and I like how they made ever character, even Chrojji seem so important!  This set has more action than any of them, as they struggle and luck out some, in there quest to try to get Sasuke to return to the leaf!

If your not a fan, and think Naruto is annoying as hell, then you should watch this set, because this is where he is most serious!

Only thing I hate, is the communist price that Amazon.com has put on this series!  Set 9 and 10 are the only one s worth this price!  Come on Amazon, give me a break!",1247443200,,624,4.024390243902439
