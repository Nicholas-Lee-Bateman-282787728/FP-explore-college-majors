I also buy cases and put all of them in one case so I can store the covers one on top of each other so I save space.",1511913600,,442,3.6595744680851063

Seeing Transformers 1-3 helps those who have only seen 4 & 5 so far. It seems that these were teenagers who were but young kids when the ""origins"" of Transformers was in the box office.
