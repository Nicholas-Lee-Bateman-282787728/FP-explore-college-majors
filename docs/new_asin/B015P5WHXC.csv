It really gives you the feeling of being front row at a Harem Scarem concert. I do wish the camera had lingered a bit more on Pete and his incredible guitar work, but I can't complain too much.

I enjoyed this so much, I watched it twice last night (once with my 7 year old Harem Scarem super fan daughter, and once with my casual fan wife - both loved it). If you're a Harem Scarem fan, this is absolutely essential viewing. And if you're not a Harem Scarem fan (and you like Journey, Van Halen, Def Leppard), start with Mood Swings II and Thirteen and Human Nature...and then buy this blu-ray.",1456617600,,703,4.366412213740458
