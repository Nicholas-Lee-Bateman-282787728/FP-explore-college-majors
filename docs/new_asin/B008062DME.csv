8523559,5,B008062DME,Unfortunately this film is not in Amazon's Prime library...too bad. This is a fabulous film about the Giant Buddhas in Afganistan that the Taliban blew up. The Taliban destroyed thousands of buddhist artifacts and this film is very education about the true history of Afganistan. Afganistan used to be a vibrant culture before the Russians and then the Taliban invaded. Wonderful narration...,1336348800,4,392,5.338709677419355
