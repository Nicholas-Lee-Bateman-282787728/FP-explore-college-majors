8277253,5,B001AEV7OS,"This movie was controversial. The first scene, depicting a female activist desperate for the debate on oil consumption was disturbing, especially since it was only an entry point into the story. Still, it was a very well made movie. The fact that this movie isn't available for sale in a US dvd format is evidence that in the US, free speech only applies to porn. Of course, the fact that I can post this review gives evidence to the contrary. Still, there is a market in the US for a US format dvd, and one must wonder why it isn't available here.",1427846400,2,548,4.382352941176471
8277254,1,B001AEV7OS,"I was unable to watch this dvd since it is only for viewing in England and Ireland.
It was a pain in the neck.  It was handled very poorly since the markings were not
clear and I was disappointed and had to pack and ship it back and pay postage.
Never again.",1287705600,3,258,3.9615384615384617
8277255,5,B001AEV7OS,"I've been wanting to buy this DVD but it is in non-usa format... can this be US formatted? I've bought a lot of BBC films from Amazon and I would certainly love to see this in a US format. It does not make sense selling DVD in US if it is not US formatted, right?",1281830400,7,263,3.8
8277256,5,B001AEV7OS,"I saw this movie twice on Planet Green TV.  Since it is a Canadian-made film, I cannot understand why it isn't being released in a North American Region 1 format.  IT NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS POWERHOWE MOVIE ABOUT THE CORRUPTION AND COLLUSIONS OF THE OIL CARTELS...about which one can learn more in Antonia Juhasz's pioneering book, THE TYRANY OF OIL: THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL INDUSTRY (available on Amazon).

For a hundred years (starting with Nikola Tesla) we've know how to get environmentally friendly non-polluting and free energy from Earth's environment, but the energy cartels -- oil above all others -- continues to control our source of energy, contributes to environmental destruction (e.g., the BP Gulf oil spill which hit my state), and create huge economic problems. BURN UP is the best movie to date taking a hard look at the oil industry.  Please release it in a Region 1 format! Meanwhile, watch for it on Planet Green TV.",1279238400,7,962,4.883435582822086
