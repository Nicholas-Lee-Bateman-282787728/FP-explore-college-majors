8661065,1,B00KRNH3O6,This movie was terrible. It appeared to be shot on my grandmother's (age 88) 1993 camcorder. I feel like the reviews on this movie had to be people who were in this movie,1419292800,2,170,4.181818181818182
8661066,5,B00KRNH3O6,OMG!!!!!  The movie is a 10 STAR MOVIE IT IS JUST LIKE THE BOOK.

8661068,5,B00KRNH3O6,Awesome movie great read! You get the best of both worlds with this collaboration I personally started with reading the book and was more than satisfied but when the movie dropped I was complete. You can't get one without the other but with either or you won't be disappointed.....,1406937600,,281,4.755102040816326
8661069,5,B00KRNH3O6,"Great Movie! I first read the book and was so excited to learn it was going to film! This movie was sooooo good! I attended the premier and was lucky enough to get a copy of the dvd straight from the Producer! You will not be disappointed, this movie touches on so many issues in Baltimore. Do yourself a favor and get your copy!",1406764800,,329,4.15625
