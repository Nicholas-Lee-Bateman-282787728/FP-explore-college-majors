7719772,4,B01DMV2QVO,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Director Jim Wynorski is responsible for several guilty pleasure films Ive enjoyed over the years.  These are films you don't want to tell people you like, and the titles include CHOPPING MALL, DINOCROC VS. SUPERGATOR, and GILA!.  The fine folks at Synapse Films and CAV Distribution found another title to add to my list:  SORCERESS.  Id never heard of the film before, but I have to admit its an obscure gem.  Chocked full of witchcraft and nudity, this is a film you won't soon forget!

Before I go any further, I have to tell you:  this is not really a horror film.  Its more like a revenge-flick (un)dressed like a horror-thriller.  But regardless, its still a lot of fun.  Just don't go into it expecting a serious movie.  Its very tongue-in-check, particularly because it feels like something Cinemax would show after the kids go to bed.

SORCERESS looks good onscreen, particularly for being 20 years old.  The HD restoration for the Blu-ray looks great, and the sound quality is nice as well.

The acting is mediocre, but it really doesnt have to be good to enjoy the film; the scenery makes up for the lack of talent.  Granted, better acting might have lent more seriousness to the subject matter, but Im not sure if it would have made a difference to the movie as whole.  This isn't really a negative for me, but I imagine many viewers will want more substance.

The story is intriguing (albeit a bit weak), and it kept my attention for the duration of the film.  Interestingly, despite the movies intentions, theres not much tension in the air.  This is probably due in part to the massive amount of flesh that is shown in every other scene.  Im not complaining, but I will confess it certainly distracts from the storyline.  Thankfully, its not a detraction from the film.

SORCERESS is a big win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  Obviously, you might want to hire a sitter or at least make sure the kids are in bed before you start it.  But the film offers a lot of fun, and it might even spice up a marriage or two.  It hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1465516800,26,2162,4.47948717948718

Before the days when internet porn took over the business anyone looking to get a glimpse of female flesh was regulated to late nights on Cinemax. Their evening fare was such that over time the channel became known as Skinimax to viewers who craved an influx of topless women with overinflated chests. Plotlines meant nothing and to this day the channel still caters to this select audience. The soft core porn films that offer simulated sex without the details and extreme measures found in actual porn remain.

This is not a judgement call on the channel or on those types of films. There have always been titillating films made that offered glimpses of the female form in various stages of undress. Depending on how you view these films will determine if you find them worth your while watching or if you consider them a gateway drug to the world of sex addiction. For most of us we see it as somewhere in between and consider the individual to either have or not have the problem. With that out of the way lets talk about SORCERESSS.

You know immediately when you put this disc into your blu-ray player what to expect. The title screen pops up with actress Julie Strain nude except for a sheer black robe draped over her shoulders rubbing oils all over her body. Nothing subtle about the movie here. Your options are limited though with choices of Setup, Chapters or Play. My guess is there wasn't much behind the scenes footage to be used on this film let alone interviews with cast and crew. It would have been nice to see some current interviews here. But on with the movie.

The story gets a bit confusing at times but begins with that opening shot of Erica (Strain) as she puts a curse on Howard Reynolds (Edward Albert) as hes driving home while talking to his wife Amelia (Linda Blair). Amelia senses something is wrong and tells him to pull over but before he can do so the car heads over an embankment as he throws himself from it. Hes saved but injured. Walking in on Erica her friend Maria tells her she won't let her use her power like this and then leaves.

In walks Ericas husband Larry (Larry Poindexter). The two quarrel with Larry pondering why he ever decided to marry her in the first place. Most of us have already figured out he was bewitched. As their argument escalates it moves to the balcony where Erica falls over the edge and dies on the ground below. As Larry takes her in his arms after rushing to her she tells him he will never be free of her.

A short time later Howard decides not to take the partnership offered him at his law firm while he recuperates and Larry is tagged for the position instead. While Maria has warned him of dark days ahead things seem better than that. Not only does he move up in the law firm but fellow attorney and ex-lover Carol come back into his life. While all of this is going on Amelia is seen working her own bit of black magic involving Larrys life, all of which is explained in the final 10-15 minutes of the film.

So there you have the plot of the movie in three paragraphs. The rest of the movie is filled with various pairings of the actors and actresses in bed with one another. Larry, Erica and Maria. Erica and Maria joined by Carol. Larry and Carol. Of the main actors involved only Blair and Albert never quite disrobe. And all of the actresses on display here have the main quality to be found in a B-movie sexploitation film: well-endowed and implanted breasts.

So the question comes up is this a good or a bad movie? Well that again depends on what you expect out of it when you buy/rent/watch it. If what you're looking for is the type of movie that Cinemax (and yes other pay cable stations did it too) shows late night weekends then youll love this movie. If you hate those films youll hate this one. But the odds are pretty good then that you're not the one its being marketed to.

What is nice is that a piece of movie history, judged neither good nor bad, has made its way onto blu-ray again. I always find that a good thing to have happen. Films have fans of all sorts, those that love everything from Disney flicks to movies that ruled 42nd Street when it wasn't the family playground it is today. Those fans deserve to have the option of having access to their favorite films in the best format possible. Synapse has done that here with a clean print of the film that fans will love having on hand.

Having once owned a video store I can tell you that there was a market for these films and it made well paid stars out of names like Strain, Shannon Tweed and Shannon Whirry. These movies filled out the shelves of stores offering something other than the latest blockbuster out there. Some are still being made today but nowhere near what they were when VHS ruled. Instead there are pale imitations to be had these days.

Myself I was never a big fan. The mixture of Satanic images (pentagrams and the like) was something I considered unnecessary in movies like this. Perhaps they're a plot element others like to use but it became far too often seen for me. Director Jim Wynorski shows that he does indeed have talent and the ability to create a good looking film no matter what the subject matter. Hes drifted back and forth between regular exploitation movies (CHOPPING MALL) and soft core flicks (BUSTY COPS) and it would be interesting to see what he could do with a major Hollywood film. For now fans will be content with adding this one to their collection. Chances are if successful more will be on the way.

Two stars is my personal opinion but for fans of the genre and stars I would say three stars.",1470700800,4,5661,4.437921077959577

7719782,3,B01DMV2QVO,"Sorceress was a bit of a let down . The story was below average - a classic tale of hot witches , hot wives and the lawyers that love them . There's a law firm with a partnership up for grabs and two lawyers who , for different reasons , really don't seem too excited about working at all , oh and one crazy gardener thrown in for good measure . The ladies were mature but 90's hot , huge fakies & big hair . It's a softcore-horror-thriller , heavy on the softcore , light on the horror/thriller elements , with lots of nudity and simulated sex . Linda Blair has limited screen time , they just needed her name , you won't see any skin from her at all . Julie Strain also has a very limited acting role though she has no problem going full-monty for art several times . There's just no substance here , a couple of big name cameos , four women and one really lucky dude shagging off and on , and some really cheesy looking witchcraft in between . The opening scene is basically the high point of the film , Julie Strain practicing some mesmerizing naked witchcraft , it's all downhill from there .",1467244800,20,1097,4.179245283018868
