7799965,5,1598037145,"Dorsey Armstrong is a very intelligent,waste-no-words teacher. My daughter & I studied this course so she could learn how to write well and analyze literature more effectively.
I highly recommend it if you want to learn how to write clearly and succinctly. Great course for the homeschool community!!!!!!!
Her other course on King Arthur is also very interesting.",1475020800,,363,5.275862068965517
7799966,5,1598037145,"Actually, I haven't read or heard the lectures yet.  However, the unbelievably critical review of Mr. Murphy compels me to purchase and see Dorsey in action.  He sold me!  I don't know Dorsey or have any connection to her.  However, she sound enthusiastic, excited, directional, passionate, and engaging.  The other positive reviews have assured me that I will learn enough to make this class worth my while.",1453766400,2,408,5.029850746268656
7799967,1,1598037145,"Watching and listening to these lectures is nothing less than screaming, nauseating agony. There must be a reason, other than teaching and learning, that someone allows this woman to lecture anywhere, under any circumstance.  The dumbing-down of western civilization and Gramscis march through the institutions comes to mind.

I purchased this video course from The Great Courses, thinking it would inspire me in some way to be a better writer. I was completely wrong. If I had this woman as a classroom instructor on any subject, I would simply rise and leave the classroom after witnessing her in action. If this woman lectured to an audience of 100 people and said the single word, chair, the audience would never know what chair she was referring to no matter how many descriptors she used to describe it. There is no identifiable format or structure to the lectures, the material is weak, and her body language is possibly the worst I have ever seen. Combined with the weak format and material of the class, her body language alone will distract most listeners from listening, causing them to speculate on what her next body movement will be. She constantly uses hand waves and chops to emphasize almost every syllable of every word. During those few seconds when her hands are idle (if ever) she is picking up, or putting down her book prop, or pacing around the rug, put there to limit her movements in front of the cameras. I even raised the edge of my hand to block all movement from her chin downward to no avail. She even emphasizes each syllable with head movements, eye movements, mouth movements, facial contortions, and if she could move her ears, she would use ear movements; additionally, the ever present hands were often visible above and below the edges of my hand.

I have a large collection of videos produced by The Great Courses and not all of them have been worthwhile to me. Although I learned something from each one, even if I learned that I disagreed with the teaching points, none of the other lecturers can hold a candle to the negative impact made on me by this woman conducting these lectures. The only group of people who might learn something from these lectures would be those who are completely ignorant of the writers craft. Additionally, I question the motive and objectiveness of anyone who reviews these lectures in a favorable way.

7799972,4,1598037145,"This is the second DVD I purchased from the great courses. Dr. Armstrong does a great job in getting the watcher to engage in this series by providing excerpts, that you should pause and follow, and asking the watcher to interpret what was just read, then going over and asking different questions. Can get repetitive but is for the dedicated writer.
Ps her hands move with her words... Weird",1367884800,5,392,4.695652173913044
