 Hooray for the good guys.",1442966400,,84,4.533333333333333

The acting is stiff and looks fake. On of the most hilarious scenes was when the terrorist took hostage of the people in a restaurant. The eyes of the leader of the terrorists looked scared. Yes, he looked scared. It's a bad joke.

There is no suspense.

There is very little action. After 35 minutes into the movie and there are still only talking scenes.

Luckily, I borrowed this from the local library instead of renting it.",1349308800,,478,4.523255813953488

8188499,5,B000P29B9Y,"Rented the DVD last night at my local video store because I saw Ron Silver on the cover.

Just in case the name doesn't ring a bell, Ron Silver used to be a big Hollywood lib, who after 9/11 turned in one of the most outspoken pro-war, anti-Islamofascist voices in Tinseltown. Ron became a staunch supporter of the war on terror, a hardcore Republican and a critic of the Michael Moore type leftwing Hollywood liberals.

So I said what the heck, even if by the cover it looks like a B movie, the guy deserves my support.
Man, I was wrong. The movie is great. I won't enter the details but I will say only this: it is the most politically incorrect movie I have ever seen in regards to Islamonazis.
Altough you can see it is made on a low budget, the acting is great, the script is engaging intelligent and even funny at times, and some of the the dialogues between the Islamic terrorists and their victims would made any liberal, ACLU or CAIR lawyer to faint.

No wonder it today's Hollywood climate of stalinist censorship this movie had no publicity, advertising or movie theater distribution whatsoever. No distributor in its right mind would have taken the risk to promote it without considering the risk of being blacklisted by the big America hating libs running the movie industry today.

Overall, a very pleasant surprise and I would recommend buying or renting the DVD. As I stated when another politically incorrect movie hit the screens a few months ago (300) the very few conservatives who are working in the movie industry need to be rewarded for their patriotism and courage. Yes, courage. Because being a conservative in the Socialist Republic of Hollyweird can cost you your career.",1180742400,15,1698,4.6879194630872485
