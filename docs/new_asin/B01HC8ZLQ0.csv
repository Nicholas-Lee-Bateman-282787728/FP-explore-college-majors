8764962,4,B01HC8ZLQ0,"An amazing show to be sure. Animation, music, and sound effects are all top notch. If your a fan of Gundam even a little bit then this show is a must watch. The only reason I've given this a 4 star review instead of a 5 is because of the god awful English voice acting. For the most part the main cast of characters are alright/bearable, but in a show filled with so many recurring characters its filled with some of the worst acting I've ever heard. I mean, I've heard some bad dubs in my time but this show has by far one of the worst. Luckily for everyone the default audio is set to the Japanese Dub with subtitles.

Positives
+Amazing fight scenes
+Stellar animation quality
+Enjoyable story with likable characters
+The SF-01 Super Fumina

Negatives
-If Hitler, Donald Trump, AIDS, and Cancer were all genetically spliced together to create one evil monstrosity then the English Dub of this show would be it's voice.",1474416000,7,922,4.548192771084337
