I bought all the seasons, and loved them very much. Looked at it many times.  Even the doctor told me to keep watching it, as I am dealing with high blood pressure, and when I watched this show, my blood pressure, would go down to normal.  I guess I do not laugh enough.  Great show!!!!!!!!!!!!  Tony & Angela play off one another very well.
Loved whole cast.  Thank you for asking.  Still, watch the program, and wish they would play in another show.
Thank you Jacque.  Enjoy !!!!!!",1402876800,2,659,4.425
8048253,5,B0007LI1QM,"I rate ""Who's The Boss?"" with 5 stars. ""Who's The Boss?"" is about a single, well-to-do woman, Angela Bower (Judith Light), who is need of a housekeeper. After she no longer has one housekeeper, she needs to hire another, and that's where ""Tony"" (Tony Danza) comes along with his daughter, ""Samantha"" (Alyssa Milano). They move in with ""Angela"" and her son ""Jonathan"" (Danny Pintauro). ""Angela's"" and ""Tony's"" relationship is strictly platonic, at first.

The focal point is how this blended family, in a sense, learns to work together. Whle, not romantic interests, best friends, they can be deemed a blended family, in a manner.

The show is a sitcom that teaches moral lessons.

I highly recommend this film to anyone!

Buy it, or rent it, you'll be glad that you did!",1137974400,,770,4.854961832061068
