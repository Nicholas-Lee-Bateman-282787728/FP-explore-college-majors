3940824,5,B002KJ7ODK,"My love of classical music originated largely with my grandparents. My grandmother and I just watched Twin Spirits, and we both found it to be a gem of artistry. Although in her 90's and well versed in the classical repertoire, my grandmother discovered a Robert Schumann previously unknown to her. Myself being familiar primarily with his four symphonies, I was introduced to a man of profound emotion and literary prowess in professing his love for Clara.

A real treat is to hear works by Clara Schumann, music I have not encountered anywhere else.

The stage production is well thought out and brilliantly interwoven between the spoken word, instrumental music and song. The cinematography compliments the staging; shot composition, lighting and dissolves create a gripping and evocative experience throughout.",1262131200,3,814,5.3515625
3940825,5,B002KJ7ODK,"I bought this DVD for my husband who loves the stories behind classical musicians, being awed by their ability to create music out of thin air.  The love letters of Shumann and his wife to be are read by Sting and his wife while musicians sing and play their compositions.  It is extremely well done and quite emotional, as well.",1262131200,4,329,4.466666666666667

2010 will mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Schumann.  Opus Arte has gotten a jump on the celebrating by releasing this 2-DVD set.  The first disc is the stage performance of ""Twin Spirits"", in which Derek Jacobi narrates the story of Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck, and how these two great artists came to be one of the greatest husband/wife teams in classical music history.
The letters and diaries that the Schumanns wrote to each other are spoken by Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler (I should stress that Sting acts, but does NOT sing, on this DVD!).  The songs of the Schumanns (and a performance of Mozart's ""La ci darem"" from ""Don Giovanni"") are sung by baritone Simon Keenlyside (featured on the November issue of BBC Music Magazine) and soprano Rebecca Evans.  Songs and chamber works are performed by very talented artists, including cellist Natalie Clein.
The second disc is loaded with great extras.  Cast discussions offer the artists' viewpoints on these two amazing figures.  The documentary ""One Heart, One Soul"" features discussion from the caretaker of a Schumann museum, offering sharp insight into the lives of Robert and Clara.  Add to that a chronology and a sort-of ""infomercial"" for Royal Opera House Education, and you've got a DVD set packed with many interesting ways to learn about Robert and Clara Schumann, two of the greatest artists of their time.  Look for Sir Willard White and Alfred Brendel among the audience members!",1257984000,13,1979,6.465909090909091
3940827,5,B002KJ7ODK,"John Caird's ""Twin Spirits"" is a beautiful collaboration between musicians, singers, and actors.  I was hooked from beginning to end.  Sting and Trudie Styler do a wonderful job of portraying Robert and Clara Schumann in words from the fun and flirty beginnings of their relationship to the bitter end.  Singers Simon Keenlyside and Rebecca Evans as well as the other musicians truly bring the Schumanns' music to life.  From a technical standpoint, I was really impressed with their thoughtful approaches to each piece.  One of the most moving phrases I heard from Clara Schumann was in a letter she wrote: ""What could be more beautiful than to clothe oneself in sound?""  It really spoke to my soul.  Where words didn't move me, the music did.  I really felt like I was being let in on something very private and personal.  By the end I was teary-eyed and completely enveloped by the Schumanns' story.",1257897600,8,902,4.8431372549019605
3940828,4,B002KJ7ODK,"Twin Spirits tells the tragic love story of Romantic composer Robert Schumann and the immensely talented pianist Clara Wieck in a uniquely staged performance by the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, featuring Sting & Trudie Styler as Robert and Clara Schumann. Robert and Clara were forbidden to communicate by Clara's father so they composed long letters to each other that were secretly delivered back and forth by their friends and servants. It is these private letters that provide the backdrop of this performance DVD. The vocal part of this passionate love story is beautifully sung by Simon Keenlyside and Rebecca Evans. Schumann's compositions throughout the performance are capably and movingly played by Sergei Krylov (violin), Natalie Clein (cello), Iain Burnside (piano), and Natasha Paremski(piano). Derek Jacobi is the narrator. This performance is an opportunity to look behind the scenes of one of the Romantic era's greatest love stories.",1256947200,4,954,5.452702702702703
3940829,4,B002KJ7ODK,"""Twin Spirits"" is an overview of Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck's relationship, as revealed in their correspondence. Musical interludes punctuate selected letters that they wrote to each other, some of which were tender and intimate, while others bordered on the tempestuous. The actors Sting and Trudie Styler portray Robert and Clara, respectively, in spoken dialog, which is interspersed with musical excerpts. Songs are sung by baritone Simon Keenlyside and soprano Rebecca Evans; the instrumentalists are Sergej Krylov, Iain Burnside, Natalie Clein, and Nataska Paremski. The soloists, both vocal and instrumental, all perform superbly. Narrator Derek Jacobi helps to support the story line when needed.
Overall, I enjoyed listening to some of the letters and learning about the Schumanns' intense relationship. The letters, some of them highly romantic, certainly added to my enjoyment of the music, which is lovely. The actors do their best, with gestures and facial expressions, to dramatize a loving relationship, but sometimes it was hard for me to sustain involvement in the program. After about one hour, I found it difficult to maintain interest in what seemed to be an overly long program. Perhaps it is hard for ""modern day"" individuals to enter easily into the romantic spirit of the era of the Schumanns.

3940830,4,B002KJ7ODK,"Sting is one of my favorite contemporary artists, and the fact that he engaged in this type of project is wonderful! Watching Sting and Trudie read love letters to each other, interspersed with the music of Clara and Robert Schumann was a definite tear jerker. Giving their songs (lieder) context by reading their love letters and journal entries really brings home how incredible their journey was and how absolutely gut wrenching the ending became. If you're a Sting fan-you'll love watching him act!",1253664000,8,502,5.0602409638554215
8372020,1,B002KJ7ODK,"In brief, on top of my humble opinion all my broken English could say about this disc is that FOR WHATEVER THEIR GOOD WILL IS, THE WHOLE PROGRAM IS PRETENTIOUS!  You can talk about music, but please let the music prove itself.  I felt stupid paying for almost 2 hours of sentimental lecture vs15 minutes of patchy music!  You robbed my dry pocket of the very last drop of sentimental tear!  What do you think of this program Mr. Alfred Brendel? - What a gimmick! By the chance, it is your musicianship I appreciate, not your ugly face (though, it looks much better than mine).",1476921600,,576,4.457142857142857
8372021,5,B002KJ7ODK,An excellent performance. A unique way of exploring the relationship between Clara and Robert. Just great.,1470441600,,106,5.6875
8372022,5,B002KJ7ODK,"This DVD about the relationship between Robert Schumann and his wife Clara Schumann is excellent and wonderfully produced.  Beautiful, but tragic, love story portrayed amazingly well by Sting and his real-life wife Trudie Styler and several first-class musicians and vocalists.  There is also a second disc which contains several very good bonus segments.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD!  And fifty-toes was an extremely good vendor, too!",1433808000,,448,5.544117647058823
8372023,5,B002KJ7ODK,Twin Spirits is exquisite and movingly beautiful.  I have shared it with graduate music faculty and they love  sharing it with their voice students.,1394841600,,148,5.125
8372024,5,B002KJ7ODK,"Wonderfull in everyway.  Almost make me cry.  The music, performance, history all very very good. Of course the actors and sigers wonderfull. I recomend fully.",1392422400,,159,5.32
8372025,4,B002KJ7ODK,Fabulous performance by Sting!  Never quite expected it. Beautiful adaptation of the love life of Schumann. Sting never ceases to amaze me.,1389052800,,139,5.318181818181818
8372026,5,B002KJ7ODK,"I hesitated for months before ordering this recording. It just sounded a little funky, eg. Sting as Schumann??Well let me tell you if you like Robert & Clara Schumann grab this recording. It is an absolute gem. I loved every moment of it. The music, the performance by each and every artist is outstanding. I hated to see it comming to an end. My thanks to the director for such a unique job. Did I say I liked it....I LOVED IT!",1361923200,,428,4.296296296296297
8372027,4,B002KJ7ODK,Not quite as good as I expected it to be but still quite enjoyable.  Sting has found a genre he handles very well which was a distinct surprise after hearing some of the stuff he usually sings. I hope he sticks with it.,1360454400,,219,4.093023255813954
8372028,5,B002KJ7ODK,"One, and only one problem. Since I bought this dvd Amazon thinks I like Sting.
Maybe that's not so bad since he did a terrific job reading Robert Schumann's letters to his eventual wife, Clara. However, this performance is so much more than Sting. I've become a real Simon Keenlyside fan. The combination of the reading of the letters and marriage diary, the chamber music, and the songs gave me and my wife a wonderful experience. If you want to explain what romantic love is to someone, buy them this dvd.",1350000000,,507,4.582417582417582
8372029,4,B002KJ7ODK,If you are looking for a sensitive portrait of this great genius and the woman who shared his life then this is a good place to start. There is a nice blend of drama and music and the experience moves along nicely. It is not the whole story but the recitations from their mutually exchanged letters is very affecting. The musical performances of songs and chamber music are first rate. For lovers of Sting this is a must see.,1286064000,,425,4.3924050632911396
