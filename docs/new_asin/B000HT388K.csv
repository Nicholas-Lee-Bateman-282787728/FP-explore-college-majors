8141048,5,B000HT388K,"My-Hime is one of those animes that you come across usually by accident. When that happened to me I thought, ""where the heck have they been hiding this one all these years?"" It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

This anime is great. It has a good mixture of emotion and action. You should definitely check it out.",1354752000,,1072,4.414141414141414
8141049,5,B000HT388K,"a wonderous opera that will help you understand love even if you thought you already did. I recommend everyone that has a passion for anime to see this and also those that don't too, and if someone would make a live action movie to this story it would be something great (no changing the story-line for ratings, etc.)",1336780800,,317,4.482758620689655
8141050,5,B000HT388K,"Volume 5 is by far my favorite volume of the My-Hime series!

This volume explores not only the main characters, but the other Hime as well a little more than the previous ones. Now that the Hime must fight one another, everyone's struggles seem to come to the surface and the plot grows darker. There are none of those annoying filler episodes either, so you won't need to worry about being entertained!

If you pay attention, you can catch on to certain hints dropped throughout the volume that are further explored and connected in Volume 6.",1168214400,,544,4.65625
8141051,5,B000HT388K,"well as we all know who has watched this anime from the beggining, when a hime looses a battle they loose the thing that means the most to them and this volume is when the story turns dark, the battle between the hime begins and someone looses someone who means everything to them, its still the beautifuly animated series that we all love, but the storylines gets dark and the end of the last episode on this disk is sad, so very sad, you have to wonder who will loose next.",1163721600,,475,4.230769230769231
