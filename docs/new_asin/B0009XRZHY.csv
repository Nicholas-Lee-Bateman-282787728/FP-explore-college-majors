2334687,5,B0009XRZHY,I am biased on this as i was stationed at the base this was filmed shortly after it was made. Knew a lot of people in it and loved it. If you were at Bitburg AB in the 53 TFS in early eighties it is a must have.,1363564800,,211,3.4166666666666665
2334688,3,B0009XRZHY,"This is not an expensive DVD, nor should it be. It's an older documentary that describes the life of F-15 pilots. Good for Air Force and F-15 fans.",1359072000,,147,4.285714285714286
2334689,5,B0009XRZHY,"The uniforms (and a lot more) have changed,  but the important things stay the same.  A fighter wing succeeds to the extent that hard work combines with teamwork to make each squadron, formation, and pilot as well-trained, ready, and lethal as they can be.  This is a great look at how that was as true 30 years ago as it is today.  (and there's some pretty good pipper control in the video, as well as some pretty poor jinking)",1302912000,5,428,4.379746835443038
8069707,5,B0009XRZHY,Item arrived on time and as advertised.,1456444800,,39,4.714285714285714
8069708,5,B0009XRZHY,a very good video if you wan't to learn about fighter pilots !,1453075200,,62,3.8461538461538463
8069709,5,B0009XRZHY,"Obviously an old video with equally old music, but a great addition to the collection of any hardcore aviation fan.",1424995200,,115,4.8
8069710,2,B0009XRZHY,This is an Airforce recruiting video. Shows the Squadron operations and they just happen to use the F-15.,1421712000,,105,4.888888888888889
8069711,3,B0009XRZHY,Could have been more flying.,1413676800,,28,4.8
8069712,5,B0009XRZHY,Nice,1412380800,,4,4.0
8069713,2,B0009XRZHY,"I'd hoped for a video about the F-15. This is centered on the staffing of the F-15. Years ago I bought a video about ""Flying Rte. 66,"" and it was a colossal disappointment. This one goes on the same shelf.",1411948800,,205,4.15
8069714,5,B0009XRZHY,"Great It's what I expected of the DVD I'm also looking to see if you have a DVD on the sr-71 blackbird I have the books because I worked on it
Leonard Mayo",1389571200,,155,3.727272727272727
8069715,5,B0009XRZHY,"This was a truly enjoyable documentary about a great airplane, with a top speed exceeding that of either an F-22 or an F-35.",1369785600,,124,4.434782608695652
8069716,4,B0009XRZHY,"Very interesting film on not just the pilots and the F-15, but also shows the people who are responsible for making sure those pilots have an airplane to fly in. I was particularly interested in this video as it showcased the 36 TFW out of Bitburg Air Base, a unit that I as a GCI radar operator worked with quite a bit in the early to mid 1980""s.",1367193600,2,347,4.117647058823529
