But ""Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland"" shows that it can be done - because everyone agreed that this was a stunning show in all respects.

Our video features Jean-Marc, who danced in the Maurice Bjart and Roland Petit companies, explaining why he thinks this is such an outstanding - and creative - production.

Here is a further comment from another Jury member:

""Magical! What talent! The music was delightful. The choreography interesting, the costumes imaginative... It was absolutely enchanting. The corps de ballet was perfect and Alice so exquisite. Superbly supported by a wonderful orchestra.""

4830266,5,B005LVEFU4,"In Jennifer Homans' magisterial history of the ballet, ""Apollo's Angels"", she reaches the rather melancholy conclusion that dance as an art form is in its death throes. Ballet's creative essence seems no longer capable of sustaining the necessary energy or infrastructure needed to generate a stream of dance works that merit description as art. Terpsichorean jewels such as those created by the great choreographer George Balanchine, especially in collaboration with composer Igor Stravinsky, appear to be relegated to a poignant late-Romantic decadence, an early evening gloaming just before the eternal night of total artistic irrelevance. It is a sobering conclusion and her evidence is substantial if not ultimately convincing.

Since Balanchine's death in April 1983 no choreographer has emerged to unambiguously don the mantle of genius. That may weigh heavily in Homans' calculations of ballet's future prospects. What we have had are glimpses of new styles of dance, of pastiche ballets, of a new irreverence that upends ballet's history. That playfulness that we signify as irreverence often toys with our expectations of what we think are the genuine artistic pretensions of modern dance versus what are merely a form of glamorous kitsch in motion. Mark Morris' ingenious and witty 1991 version of The Nutcracker, ""The Hard Nut"", is a landmark representative of several of these trends and the very embodiment of the new playfulness.

With the 2011 premiere of Christopher Wheeldon's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, based on Lewis Carroll's children's book for grown-ups, the various recent trends in ballet have been united in a masterful souffle. Instantly and dramatically obvious is that Alice is only possible in our multimedia era. And because of Alice's complexity, its presentation is unthinkable without access to robust computer technology. It features stunning stage designs, a barrage of kaleidoscopic scenery, gigantic three-dimensional human puppetry, film, video, shadow plays, trompe l'oeil imagery, urban architecture, landscapes, gardens, human hedgehogs and flamingos, imaginative costumes, hand puppets, dancers and an orchestra. Uniting these disparate elements must have been difficult.

Wheeldon's choreography - with its sly historic allusions to choreographers such as Martha Graham, Balanchine and (inevitably) Mark Morris, athletic or elegant dance moves created by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, absolutely stunning tap dancing, the over-ripe glamour of Las Vegas show girls, Hip-Hop, ballroom dancing and disco - is endlessly inventive. Yet despite this rainbow of dance elements, Alice never feels like a pastiche. It is always an organic whole. Alice's choreography is spirited and fun and always a joy to watch. Especially remarkable are Lauren Cuthbertson's Alice (she dances the entire 70 minute first act, a test of endurance that leaves her with several large, angry looking bruises and scrapes) and Zenaida Yanowsky's deliriously funny Queen of Hearts. All of the dancers are superb, exemplifying why the Royal Ballet maintains such a high reputation.

Joby Talbot's music is distinctive and often quite beautiful. It contains elements reminiscent of Stravinsky, the British Pastoral composers, Brian Easdale's lovely score for the Red Shoes ballet, the film music of John Williams and Minimalist composers like John Adams. What it most definitely is not is a traditional ballet score as composed by Delibes or Tchaikovsky. Those who expect such a conservative score are advised to stick with their ballets. The set, scenic and costume design are all exemplary with work of the highest imaginative force and arresting visual beauty. Alice is a veritable feast for the eyes.

The Opus Arte Blu-Ray disc is a technical marvel of sound and image. The music is presented in 2-channel lossless DTS-HD Master Audio and is crystalline in its resolution and beauty of sound. The 1080i video is color saturated and lovely to see. What some reviewers have complained about, and a viewpoint I share to some degree, is the shot selection by the cameras. Much of Alice is filmed at middle distance or even further away with fairly frequent cutaways. I suspect this may have something to do with the large, crimson bruise that Lauren Cuthbertson suffered on her shoulder during the ballet. Cuthbertson never exhibits any discomfort (she is a consummate professional) but it cannot have been easy for her to dance so energetically hampered as she was. The director may have been compensating on the fly in order to minimize showing the injury to his star as she danced in every scene of the first act.

Alice suggests that ballet may be morphing into something new: a multimedia presentation incorporating imaginative use of all of the visual and motion arts. This may be where the genius of ballet will settle in the future. If so, ballet isn't dying; it is undergoing a metamorphosis into an entirely new vision of dance. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with all of its humor and beauty and complexity, may be remembered as the first masterpiece of an emerging genre of ballet. And it helps make the future of ballet look a bit less bleak to those who love the dance.

4830267,2,B005LVEFU4,"I love Wheeldon's work but this DVD is a disappointment.  The video editing is dreadful, often giving us choppy cuts between medium shots and close ups, when we should be seeing the entire stage or at least the entire bodies of the dancers. It's viscerally annoying and completely spoils the flow and rhythm of the dance. Joby Talbot's score is also dreadful - filled with tinkley effects rather than memorable melodies and recurring themes. The only redeeming aspects--and they aren't redeeming enough--are the sets, stagecraft, and special effects.  If you love dance, you won't love this. This critique, by the way, is meant as a review of the DVD, not the ballet, which can't be properly appreciated as presented.",1328832000,11,717,5.016806722689076
4830268,2,B005LVEFU4,"Well, I must be spoiled by the sounds of Tchaikovsky, Delibes, Adam, Prokofiev etc. But where is music in this ballet?  There are sounds, mostly random, there are trite themes, but otherwise I prefer to watch it muted. Visually the ballet is colorful indeed. Humor? Perhaps. But mostly low level sort of. Dances? Crowdy. Chaotic. But not deterministically chaotic as Carroll intended. Music could have saved it all, but again, where is it?",1325721600,7,439,5.013698630136986
4830269,4,B005LVEFU4,"No efforts have been spared, sets-wise, dance-wise as well as money-wise to make this production worth owning for home viewing. I cannot say more than most others have said about the dancing. Excellently shot video as well. At the end of it, a very satisfying production, for a night that I would not miss... especially the second act, which 'saves' the production.

So why just 4 stars?

The Plus Points:

1. Almost all the characters in the ballet have a significant role to play dance-wise. The story offers such a bevy of diverse characters, and each have been portrayed rather competently, with something for everyone on the stage.

2. Nice innovations within the ballet, especially for the Tap Dancing Mad Hatter, a brilliant move that brings out the character of the Mad Hatter in to the dance form beautifully. The role of the Duchess has been performed by the 'imported' theater personality brilliantly. The Pax de Deux in the ballet are simply superb, both dance and music-wise, and this is where Cuthbertson and Polunin are at their very best. The parody within the ballet, - a take off on Aurora's birthday party dance by Tchaikovsky is quite very apt and beautifully choreographed and executed.

3. Sets, Lighting and special effects lift this ballet to the 21st century, and an indication of the the shape of things to come... Excellently shot video too.

4. Well performed and recorded music.

A Neutral Point to Ponder:

According to me, whether a ballet becomes a 'classic' or falls by the wayside or into an occasionally performed piece is solely dependent on the strength of its music. The more successful productions of the ROH have had excellent music to support the dances. In Mayerling, it was the music of Liszt... For La Fille mal Gardee, it became a success by adding on the music of Rossini, Donizetti, Pugni and possibly others to the original fare of Ferdinand Herold. I must point out that a European production of the La fille mal Gardee with ONLY the music of Ferdinand Herold is almost forgotten today on stage.
Kenneth Macmillan survived beautifully thanks to Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Joplin etc, but one of his greatest choreographic successes is not so popular because the music is not as endearing as in the others... I am referring to 'Judas Tree' - music by Brian Elias.
Some other ballets well choreographed and danced that have not become classics owing to 'ho-hum' music lines are those like the 'Prince of the Pagodas', and possibly 'Ondine'. Outside England, 'Fillet du Pharon' also seems to be falling into this category, as indeed, La Sylphide, one of the first ever full length ballets. Other examples of such 'failures' even in Bolshoi is 'Anyuta' (music of Gavrilov), some ballets with music of Asafiev and more than 90% of the ballets scored by mid or late 20th century composers in France and Germany among others.

In Alice, the music is clearly quite novel and different from those above that have experimented with new composers for full length ballets. However successful Wheeldon is in his choreography, the years ahead will determine if Talbot's score becomes popular enough for this ballet to be called or deemed a classic. If one were to read the musical background of Talbot, it becomes very clear that he did what he does best... score for the cinema and video. Many a time, especially in the first half, the music tends to be something of a cross between Mussorgsky (reminding one of the 'Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks' variety) and something that John Williams kept writing for a space adventures... with some influence and covert references to or from Minkus, Saint-Saens and Prokofiev too, and even Stravinsky. The music may aptly be described as an apotheosis of the percussion, and it keeps tingling in the brain long after the ballet is finished. Some bits of the ballet however, stand out, especially in the richly orchestrated dances and waltzes that do not give the overwhelming prominence to Percussion, although some others like the Catterpillar's dance is more of an anachronism in musical caricaturization. The Pax de Deux - all of them stand out beautifully too....

The Obvious Cons:

1. The ballet itself : If one were to take away the sets and the lighting and other 21st century effects, what remains is an exercise in choreographing over 30 individual dance pieces - with not much continuity from dance to dance. Nothing very great about the routine choreography either. One has to identify the characters through the costumes, and not the dance per se, with the brilliant exception of the Mad Hatter and the Duchess.

2. The First Act is just too lugubrious at times and sometimes too 'ponder-some' in all three departments, music, dance and choreography. There is not much of a development. It IS slightly boring at times. But the second act is a total lifesaver for the entire production. Quite a contrast.

3. There are some idiosyncrasies in the beginning of the first act as well as the ending. One reviewer has already pointed it out, the scene that leads up to the whole 'hole' scene, as well as the incongruity of the mobile phone and the camera in the 1842 settings to start with and end with..... Did Alice and her boyfriend get transported through time to 2011? But thank god that these stupidities introduced (for no real purpose in the ballet or the story) are limited only to those short scenes.

All in all, I would recommend the purchase of this blu ray. I think the music, however I may have described its possible fate in the future, is quite instantly appealing, and the whole narration of the story in ballet is quite superb. I am not surprised that no other composer or producer of the 19th or 20th century thought of producing a ballet on Alice... the right effects may have been rather difficult, and so also the music for those times.

YES, it is a great beginning to the ballet for the 21st century... A very honest and sparkling effort.",1325721600,47,5945,4.820412168792934
4830270,5,B005LVEFU4,"I watched this ballet last night.  It had two strikes against it before I turned on the dvd - I have the flu and it had kicked up fibromyalgia so I hurt like the dickens.  But this zany, wacky, beautiful, chaotic wonderful ballet took me to another world away from my grumpy state.  Furthermore - for the most part the camerman allowed us to usually see most of the set and all of it from time to time.  Not a lot of closeups and dancers with no feet and the rest of the dancers and set cut out of the film like the very disappointingly poor camera work in the last two ballet dvds I watched recently.  (Two SF ballets -The Little Mermaid (might be a really good ballet but cannot tell it by the dvd) and the  San Francisco Ballets fantastic idea of setting nutcracker in SF. In both of those  dancers and set ignored - lots of head shots etc - ruined by the camerman focusing on face and forgetting that dancers have legs and feet.  In my humble opinion the dancing in Alice in Wonderland was great, the music modern and great (even to a very old lady), the costumes fantastic and very very clever. Love that cat and the camera work did not drive me insane.  It is now on the ""favorite shelf"".",1324166400,5,1194,4.224669603524229
4830271,4,B005LVEFU4,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, with music by Joby Talbot, is the Royal Ballet's latest attempt at a legendary, new story ballet. Designed by Bob Crowley, the work is visually dazzling and constantly chaotic, in terms of set design. Unfortunately, what the ballet lacks is the stable and classical choreographic aesthetic of traditional story ballets. When the ballet rests on its choreography, it falls flat and unexciting. What makes the ballet unique and interesting is the stunning constant set changes and the sheer diversity of the dancers and sets. It's entertaining, yes, but lacks the once-cherished cleanness, organization, and togetherness of Petipa-esque ballets. However, the effort made on this complicated and detailed story is admirable.
The music is a modern twist on classical, ballet music with several rhythms and melodies, making for a very enjoyable soundtrack. Notable dancers include Sergei Polunin as Jack/The Knave of Hearts, Edward Watson as Lewis Carroll/The White Rabbit, Zenaida Yanowsky as Mother/The Queen of Hearts, and Steven McRae as a tap-dancing Magician/The Mad Hatter.

This ballet is visually stunning and interesting to watch, though falls flat in terms of choreography. I'd recommend this for someone more interested in the bravura display of theatrical wealth, with less inclination towards classical artistry.",1321747200,7,1394,5.701923076923077

There are superb performances by, among others, Edward Watson (in an uncharacteristically comic role) as the White Rabbit, Steven McRae as the Mad Hatter, and Sergei Polunin as the Knave of Hearts.  The whole production is true in its tone to the slightly off-putting humor of the original, sometimes approaching (but never reaching) grand guignol; at the same time, Polunin and Cuthbertson's duos have a splendid sweetness.  Cuthbertson somehow manages to dance brilliantly throughout  and yet always to be in character.

That said, I do appreciate the elegance and athleticism of the dancers, and especially the physical humor that both the Alice and Red Queen players brought to their roles - something I don't associate with ballet, and very much enjoyed. The Inchworm character had some great scenes as well, and I liked the interplay between cleaver-wielding Cook and the executioner.  The Duchess came off well too, bringing to mind Leo McKern's role in my favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/B002VXEC26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>&nbsp;to date. Stagecraft was exceptional, including a clever set for Alice's ""eat me"" change of scale. To top it all off, the music worked beautifully with the story - those nails-on-blackboard chords for the Red Queen couldn't have been better.

As a dance outsider, I found the choreography much more approachable and narrative than in another ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice/dp/B000MRNWSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice</a>&nbsp;I've seen. So, for many reasons, it all came together for me: fidelity to the original story, sets and delightful play of costuming, physical storytelling (and jokes), and pageantry. Much to my surprise, I enjoyed this immensely.

It is a very enjoyable creation based on a story that has been told many times and in different ways.  It will be enjoyed by kids and grownups alike.
The dancing and the choreography is just wonderful. Although it is defined as a ballet in two acts, I would say that is a ballet with pantomime and acting together and that combination makes it even more enjoyable.  The music is nice, modern while accessible. The use of extensive percussion makes it different than a normal ballet, but I find it effective and being part of the story.  The use of projections and special lightning is very well executed and it adds to the enjoyment.  Most of the story happens in Wonderland, so expect to be in a magic environment. The extra feature gives and insight to the creation process.

4830294,5,B005LVEFU4,"The Royal Ballet (England) at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London has created a delightfully surreal version of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.""  Those who are looking for a camera set steady in the balcony recording steadfastly one angle and one view as from a member of the audience's viewpoint, will hate this.  Those who love only the old Romantic Style music will be disappointed.  Those with open minds for new forms, new humor, new music, new approaches, burlesque, detailed story telling through dance gestures, who want music almost as a background developing the story, will love this.

The opening scene at the home of Alice's parents, her friends, the lower class Jack, the photographer is delightful and has the Victorian Upper Middle Class stereotypes right on.  Alice's fall through the rabbit hole is marvelous the decor of the hole changing as she descends, and then ascends back to home.  Most of the scenes of Carroll's book are present, but the biting political satire of Carroll's England is absent (at least for this American).  The scenes are played for their humor and their human side.  This is exceptionally well done.

The dancing is very good.  The orchestra, while in the pit, is not upfront with lots of noise, but behind, accenting, leading, suggesting, sometimes merely a descant moving the action along.  This is played very well, at times almost disappearing into the story line, but never absent.  The sets are imaginative and fun.  The costumes are elaborate, colorful and surreal as only English costumes can be, with clashes of style even on the same character, leading to being humorous in their own right.  The White Rabbit is especially effective as an ""on my"" type person, standing tall and frequently looking shocked.  The duchess in a heavily layered dress and a very broad face is delightful.  The Queen of Hearts dances well, at times a burlesque parody of both ballet and modern dance.  The effect is actually very funny.  Her facial expressions are marvelously well done.  Sergei  Polunin, an excellent dancer, with the most traditional ballet choreographing in the production,  is a likable kind of guy throughout, both as Jack and the Knave of Hearts.  The Cheshire Cart in multiple pieces on poles carried by at least 10 stage hands in black, barely visible, is truly a work of art and humor.  The photography is marvelous. most often near stage wide, or following a character and his/her dance, or closeup for emotional displays.

4830307,5,B005LVEFU4,"This ballet is the best version of Alice that I have seen - it beats the various movie versions hollow. It really captures the spirit of Lewis Carroll's fantasy. I didn't know what to expect and really only bought it because Ed Watson danced the White Rabbit. I am a great fan of his. The White Rabbit hardly has the same dramatic scope as crazy Prince Rudolf in Mayerling, but Watson is always a joy to watch.
Lauren Cuthbertson brought just the right sense of naive wonder to the role of Alice, but Zenaida Yanowsky as the Red Queen stole the show. Her technical expertise and her comical timing are perfect. Steven Macrae as the tap dancing Mad Hatter is also a highlight of the show.
The sets and costumes are very well designed - the caterpillar is especially outstanding. I liked the way that the Victorian house party bracketed the  beginning and the end of the fantasy, the characters turning into their fantasy counterparts once Alice goes down the rabbit hole.
The dancing throughout is of the high standard one would expect from the Royal Ballet.
This ballet will be enjoyed by children and adults alike and will inspire the audience to read the books again!",1363996800,4,1169,4.647342995169082

4830310,5,B005LVEFU4,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>), as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with the same review title used throughout.

REVIEW OF THIS 2011 PRODUCTION OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND . . .
I am not a ballet expert. But why not a review from a ballet neophyte... for neophytes. The fact is you could actually subtitle this production: BALLET FOR THE COMPLETE IDIOT. Why? Because this is not your father's ballet, that's why. This is not just a few thin women tiptoeing around on stage and waving their arms around to music in some unintelligible fashion. No. This is dance, of course, and music, but the performance is infused with sets, multimedia, props, color, and beautiful backgrounds. It's wonderfully creative and highly innovative. It's funny. It's sexy. It's alive!

And yes, it's Alice. But not the Alice you already know. In doing the Alice reviews I've been using the word ""adaptation"" to describe enactments of Lewis Carroll's works that stick pretty close to the passages in the book and of course the dialog. Conversely I've been using the word ""interpretation"" to describe the productions that deviate substantially from the book yet still keep the core storyline intact, such as several of the made-for-tv movies that render Alice as a musical. And finally, I've reserved the word ""takeoff"" to describe the works that are only loosely based on the name and likeness of Alice, and the quality of Wonderland's strangeness. But none of these words fit this production. We need a new word. This ballet is really a ""re-imagining"" of Alice in Wonderland. It's Alice, yet it's not. It's a piece based on *words* in a book, yet there is not a single line of dialog. Hello?! How did they do that? I don't know, but I can tell you how they got off the hook for tendering a pretty deviant version of Alice. Quite simply, and this is the only spoiler, and actually it might be helpful for Carroll purists to know this up front... they have the actress playing Alice fall asleep while reading `Alice in Wonderland'. The ballet is this dancer's dream. So, they get a free hand. A distant analogy would be how J.J. Abrams got away with changing well known historical events in the latest Star Trek movie by going back in time and altering the timeline. These are cheap tricks but they work. It allows the audience to suspend their disbelief in spite of the incongruities.

I would also like to send a special note to men who may be a bit squeamish or otherwise reticent to invest in a ballet. Don't be. The star of the show is the beautiful ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson (27), and she is accompanied by an array of equally beautiful female dancers. The sweet flower of femininity really blooms here so you don't want to miss it.

Something else worth noting to all non-ballet types; this production is apparently a REALLY BIG DEAL in the ballet community. This is the highly esteemed Royal Ballet's first new production in 20 years. Because of all the modern trappings such as special effects, this ballet is being described by experts as a new kind of ballet. A 21st century ballet. Speaking of experts, some of them loved this ballet... some of them hated it. That's the way it is with experts. For myself, I found this piece far more approachable than any other dance or operatic enactment of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to date. It's worth buying the DVD because it's a piece you will likely watch again and again. Enjoy!

4830311,5,B005LVEFU4,"Someone(s) were really thinking outside the box in this production.  Phenomenal sets and creative staging, choreography and characterization.  Love that Alice looks more like Alice Liddel instead of the Tenniel pics.  Wonderful, wonderful!  Only regret is that the music is not available yet :(",1338768000,4,294,5.613636363636363
4830312,4,B005LVEFU4,"This new offering from The Royal Ballet was a very ambitious project taken on by Monica Mason CBE who is the artistic director of The Royal Ballet, as it will no doubt be her farewell production. She has done an amzing job.
It is good entertainment and splendid sets and effects. The dancing is sparce, only at the end does Wheeldon's briliance show through. Too many exits and entrances and general confused movements. The lead Laura Cuthbertson makes a brilliant attempt as being a believable Alice. Her lead partner is Polunin who is always very good and well trained. The best two pas de deux come right at the end almost back to back so the show does end with a bang. The Queen of Heats is brilliantly performed by Yanosky. The choreography is a bit too weak I think through the entire ballet. This is not the work of MacMillan or Ashton however it is very British and has that particular feeling. Its good fun if thats what you want. The music is plesant but none is memorable however it could have been as he had many good introductions but no refrain, I suppose that is meant to be modern. Its good fun and worth having  for a laugh. A pity as the final pas de deux is just brilliant but too little brilliance in all this confused staging.",1337040000,3,1247,4.421739130434783
4830313,5,B005LVEFU4,"First, let me respond to some of the other reviewers' criticisms.

I do not understand the review that complains about the editing.  It is true that the camera is not distant and static, but this work does not have any elaborate compositions for the corps, or even elongated pas-de-deux, that would benefit from this treatment.  The closeups are dynamic and exciting, and entirely appropriate to the burlesque nature of the show.

The music is not great, but it is better than any officially sanctioned ""classical"" music composed after 1950 that I have ever heard, so by those standards you could even consider it melodic and beautiful.  The music is perfectly in keeping with the character of the work.  Given that ALL modern music is severely debased from classical standards, it would be churlish to complain about the effort made here.

Second, why do I rate this five stars?

Don't try to compare this to a classical ballet.  It is a a frivolous work of entertainment.  You won't see prolonged displays of elegance. You won't be moved or captivated by its beauty---well, maybe you will be surprised sometimes!  But you certainly will be amazed by its virtuosity and creativity.

Within its own aesthetic realm, of color, spectacle, costume and set design, it is absolutely unparalleled.  The effects are really superb, and perfectly express the character of the original Alice in Wonderland.  If you were to judge any classical ballet by the costuming and design standards set here, you have to fail Swan Lake, Giselle, and countless others.  The twists on the original tale are delightful and play off of the Alice story in a delightful way.  The whole work expresses a fantastical ""Aliceness"" that will stay with you after watching. It is joy and wit expressed in movement, and is entirely bold and original.  It is true art and artistry, and I can do nothing but applaud the effort.",1331251200,19,1890,4.8930817610062896

The sets are amazing, the choreography is clever, the dancers are excellent, and the costumes are well done too.  The story is easier to follow than most ballets, but it does help to have a rudimentary understanding of Alice in Wonderland before watching it because the story is so nonsensical to begin with.  We laughed a lot during the show -- especially enjoying the Queen of Hearts' dance.  We've watched it 3 times in the past week and have been amazed that with each viewing we find new things to appreciate that we missed on previous viewings.  Enjoy!",1513382400,,653,4.743362831858407

8478600,4,B005LVEFU4,"I don't care what the purists say. I like this ballet. Its an extremely imaginative and lavishly staged production with a fun, modern style. The dancing, music, costumes, props, and stage effects all meld together to make a throughly enjoyable show. Lauren Cuthbertsons acting chops are particularly impressive; she makes Alice much more than just a bunhead doing steps.

Im a big fan of parody and farce, so I was especially tickled by the Royal Ballet poking fun at the companys most treasured, most symbolic ballet (The Sleeping Beauty) along with its biggest star ever (Fonteyn). Who ever thought the House of de Valois and Ashton would dare to send up its own history? But it has, and brilliantly! Theres also a hilarious jab at Maya Plisetskaya for fans of Soviet-era ballet. Zenaida Yanowsky could have a second career as a comic actor, Id say.

Four stars. The performance loses some steam late in the second act and the score is not particularly memorablethats a place where the traditionalists are correct, Tchaikovsky probably composed the best ballet scores from a musical perspectivebut this disc is still definitely worth watching.",1504224000,,1145,5.052910052910053
