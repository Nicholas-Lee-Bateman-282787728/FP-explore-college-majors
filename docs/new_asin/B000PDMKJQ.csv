Premonition, & The Long Road Home DVD's. Are sold seperate on Amazon. I have both of them I give Premonition a 10 + Long Road home a  8 +.
Why Is  Amazon allowing this BOOTLEG DVD set to be sold on this site. When It was removed ALONG WITH THE SELLER THAT WAS SELLING THE SET TOGETHER a while back. I give this Item a - 0000000000. AMAZON LOOK AT YOUR SELLERS LISTINGS??????",1177027200,8,516,4.03921568627451
