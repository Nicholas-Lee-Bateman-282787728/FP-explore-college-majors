3521109,5,B001D0I4Q8,"I bought this DVD set for my daughter because she loves this show.  She absolutely loved it!  I could not find it anywhere in the stores so I decided to shop online.  Next time, I will go directly to Amazon.com!",1231200000,,211,4.225
3521110,5,B001D0I4Q8,"I really enjoy Jon & Kate Plus 8.  I noticed that some reviews talk about ""screaming kids"". I don't see that. It's crazy at times, but that's real life!!",1229472000,,153,4.275862068965517
3521111,2,B001D0I4Q8,"I ordered this item for my neice and daughter.  They both had scratches on a few of the disc.  Apparently this has been a problem that hs been reported, but still continues to happen.",1228089600,,183,4.352941176470588
3521112,1,B001D0I4Q8,"Well, after a long wait, I finally got Jon & Kate Plus Eight The Complete seasons one & two. However, the excitement ended when I turned the DVD over, I noticed the back of it was purple. I been reading reviews about this issue. Amazon said they can't sell burned items. Well, like everyone I read about that had issues with the DVD's, as I said I am vary disappointed that the items are copies and not the actual DVD's from the TLC site. Some advice for J&K fans go to TLC's site, and look at the covers. they are not the same one's like Amazon has.
  The disc's do play however, my DVD player always makes a certain sound when reading a DVD R Vs a regular DVD. So I hope this helps people in the future.",1227225600,2,705,4.101449275362318

3521115,1,B001D0I4Q8,"If you like screaming children and whining, and I don't mean just from the kids then this is for you.  I would prefer to watch a cat fight.",1223337600,2,139,3.9642857142857144
3521116,4,B001D0I4Q8,"My boyfriend surprised me with this last week. He knows how much I love the show (every Monday night I am glued to the TV) and he preordered it for me. What a great guy! I was hoping it would have extras, but who cares when you get hours of Gosselins! The quality was great, I spent all of Saturday watching straight through. I just love this show! I would recommend this to any Jon and Kate Plus 8 fan or anyone who loves adorable Asian babies as much as I do!",1221436800,11,461,4.021739130434782

3521118,2,B001D0I4Q8,"I bought this new, and it came to me used with scratches on the disc. Furthermore, it is not even the real dvd set. The discs are clearly burned on DVD-R Verbatim discs. The DVDs skip at certain parts and do not play on certain DVD players. I hope this is from some customer that bought the real version and returned the fake copy and not the doing of Amazon.com because that would be a shame.",1218412800,29,393,4.184210526315789

too bad that this family is broken .",1386633600,,124,4.208333333333333
8290685,3,B001D0I4Q8,"I love Jon and Kate and all there kids. This set is wonderful. And I'm very excited to view it. But I did want to warn that people are selling these disks and they are not the original copy they are burned from a computer. My disks work but the seller did not tell me they were burned disks they stated they were new. I have noticed in some of the other reviews that other people have got burned (copy) disks also, some worked some didn't it looks like this is a common thing with this disk set. Hopefully you will be lucky and get the original copy. But I did want to warn that this was going on. Enjoy Jon and Kate plus 8 they are awsome.",1236988800,2,640,4.0078125

8290687,1,B001D0I4Q8,"I'm highly disappointed with this product. I bought this product for $36.99 when it sells in the store for $14.99. Then I recieve it and they are burned copies of the real thing. There are no special features and the disks don't even play. I returned it once and requested a new copy, only to get the same burned and broken copy. I have yet to recieve my refund and its been almost 2 months. I'm highly upset with this purchase and the amount of time it is taking to get my money back. Never again will I buy DVD's from Amazon. It should be stated more clearly that these are BURNED copies and are not the real thing. I'm still waiting for my refund",1232668800,2,649,4.2
8290688,3,B001D0I4Q8,"I got this DVD for Christmas and I was THRILLED! I just finished the DVD and everything about it is great. Great audio, quality, all episodes of season 1, the VERY first episode ever put out before the show actually went through season. But... It's missing the last few episodes of season 2. When I learned about this, I was a bit upset and wish that they had the rest of the shows included. As well as special features. I would love to see behind the scene work, more with Jon and Kate plus the kids. Something ""never-before-seen"" stuff as well. I was hoping for more excitement with the DVD, but hey. I think I can live. This DVD is worth having, but will make you wish that they had the rest of season 2 and special features. A great DVD for ALL families!",1232409600,2,758,4.270833333333333
