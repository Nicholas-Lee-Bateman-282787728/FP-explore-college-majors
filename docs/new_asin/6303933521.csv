8202043,5,6303933521,"Time for the secrets to be let go on this video.  It's mainly a  compilation of videos from the ""Us"" album, running in the  following order:
1. Digging In the Dirt 2. Steam 3. Blood of Eden 4.  Solsbury Hill 5. Zaar 6. Come Talk to Me 7. Kiss That Frog
The video from  ""Steam"" won two MTV video awards (yeah, I know, woohoo), and all  but ""Zaar"" (from the album Passion) and ""Solsbury Hill""  (from his first solo album) are from ""Us.""  All of these videos  are amazing, as would be expected from Mr. Gabriel.  ""Zaar"" and  ""Solsbury Hill"" feature work by contemporary painters Stefan  Roloff and Graham Dean.
This is the only place you'll find videos for  ""Come Talk to Me,"" ""Kiss That Frog,"" ""Zaar,""  and ""Solsbury Hill,"" as the others were only periodically played  on MTV during the album's initial release.  The video also includes rare  interview and behind the scenes footage, showing all of the artists that  were involved in the performance of this album.
