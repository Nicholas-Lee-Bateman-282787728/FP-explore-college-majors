8062555,2,B0009KA894,"Let me start with the format. The copy I received was burned DVD-R with a home-made label. My DVD player chokes on it about halfway through the disc. The second issue I have is that if you're still trying to learn the katas, the guy moves pretty fast. It's hard to stay up with him (even after they slow him down). It is a bit more difficult to follow a video than it is to watch a 3-D class of students and teachers who turn with you (once you're not facing the screen, it's hard to follow along). I was expecting a little more commentary on how each form was done (they do mention when to keep a heel down here and there). I was hoping for more of a ""forward stance here, moving into a cat stance, high block, high block, middle punch..."" etc.

I was a little disappointed in this one. Also, the only kata is the first form and a little of Tekki. The beginning history of kata was kind of interesting, but past that, this wasn't exactly what I was looking for.",1204761600,,962,4.172043010752688
