8472546,5,B004D2YNRM,"John Anton's Guns drugs and dirty money is an in your face no holds barred thrill ride. This film shows what a creative mind and a few bucks can do on the indie movie scene. It is raunchy at times, funny at times , a little long winded at times but always exciting and action packed. Eric Roberts babysits for his best friends son and to kill some time he starts to read him a comic book that he is drawing and off we go into the movie. The ultra clever tool through out this film is the use of comic book style graphics and text fonts to help us down the rabbit hole of this crazy story. I couldn't even to begin to explain this plot, it has so many characters and sub plots going for it, but rest assured it is not overly confusing and fun to follow. If you are a fan of gangster films, indie action, comic books, guns, drugs, and dirty money you need to give this film a try.",1294963200,,878,4.022857142857143
