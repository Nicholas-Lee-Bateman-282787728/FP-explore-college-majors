4138052,5,B003L77GDS,In this episode the Ryan / Michael relationship is explored. There is a lot of character development with just as many laughs. A must see for the fan and any newcomer.,1296950400,,167,4.419354838709677
4138053,5,B003L77GDS,"This show has had many peaks and valleys and while it remains to be seen how the 7th season will eventually play out, this episode is one of the best in years. If you are an old school Office fan and liked the show for it's more restrained and heart warming moments, this episode offers that. It still has the over the top broadness of recent history, however, those moments fit into this episode, ""Andy's Play"", seamlessly.

Remember season 2/3 when the show had the ability to make you laugh so much you nearly choked to having sympathy/empathy for a character(s) in a devastating emotional moment to having you wipe tears out of your eyes to see the whole cast involved in something together whether it was silly or poignant (or both)? That's the kind of stuff ""Andy's Play"" has.

There isn't one false step in this episode; everything works. That's something I haven't been able to say for this show over the majority of the last 2 seasons. There have been great episodes scattered throughout those two seasons (sometimes even in stretches) but not on a consistant basis.

For this season while some episodes haven't been as funny as others the believability factor has been there early into this season. And for this episode everything came together again...not only is it believeable but it is hilarious and emotionally compelling. And from what I know about what next week's episode is about, things are looking good for the show to ride this wave of greatness.",1286582400,3,1468,4.749019607843137
4138054,5,B003L77GDS,"This a slammin episode. As if the other ones weren't. They also have something new and so fuuuuuunnnnnnyyyyy!!! I laugh so hard sometimes that I forget that I have back pain. I hope they continue for years to come but if they don't thank God, for series dvds. I just can't get enough of these crazzzyyyy people! I love them!!!!",1285804800,,327,4.466666666666667
4138055,5,B003L77GDS,"""Nepotism"" it a wonderful season premiere for the Office.  It is also, in my opinion, the best episode of the series in quite a while.  This laugh-out-loud episode includes everything that you'll like about the Office.  The characters were true to themselves (which I think was an issue in season 6) and the story was very simple and understated which is what works so great on this show!",1285459200,4,388,4.676470588235294

The more we learn about government at all levels, the too-big-to-fail banking institutions, investment advisors and their corporations, the educational-industrial complex, large, successful, bureaucratic charitable foundations--the more hilarious ""The Office"" becomes!  As the Season One DVD byline puts it, ""Petty Behavior... Zero Productivity... All in a Day's Work.""  It's EVERYWHERE all around us in the real world!
Are we going to laugh or cry?  I'm going to LAUGH!  I'm right in there with Jim and Pam, expectantly going into the conference room to witness the next self-humiliating Michael Scott meeting presentation...but I get to bring POPCORN!",1429920000,,723,5.657407407407407

4138673,5,B003L77GDS,"This is a totally biased review because we love this show and loved it long before buying the DVDs.  Addmittedly, the first season is a bit rough around the edges.  The show really gets its stride during season 2 and doesn't slow down until it ends.  Great show!",1400457600,,262,4.416666666666667

4138802,5,B003L77GDS,I loved the Office and could not get enough of the series.  This was a perfect fix until I reached the end.  Great deleted scenes and commentary.,1394409600,,145,4.333333333333333

4138804,4,B003L77GDS,"As an Office fan, I loved season 7. However, the packaging on these is unacceptable. I've ordered every season of the Office through amazon and whenever they come individually packaged they are always scratched and slightly torn up on the edges because of the cheap packaging. I've complained to amazon about this and they said that they weren't the ones who sold it to me, but they could give me a refund if I wanted to return. No amazon, I don't want to return it..I just want it to look nice on my shelf. That being said, when they are ordered in a bigger quantity (multiple seasons at once) they are not scratched or torn because they come in a box, not the manilla envelope. My advice: if you plan to own all the seasons, try group your orders together to avoid cheap packaging and damages to your Blu Ray.",1393718400,,811,4.413333333333333

4138806,3,B003L77GDS,"I love love love the Office.  Especially up to about season 4.  The only reason I purchased this was because a.) it was cheap and b.) I only had up to season 5 and for the price it was worth completing the collection.  That being said, the latter half of the run isn't horrible. I can't seem to pinpoint the moment the show ""jumped the shark"", it just seems like at some point they just found a spot that had a ton of sharks circling the waters and just hung out there and tried to jump all of them. I really feel like the series finale was one of the best and successfully brought closure to the characters and the show as a whole.  I'll still keep watching from season 1 to 9, even if some of the later seasons are a bit painful.",1392422400,,731,4.055555555555555
4138807,5,B003L77GDS,So I bought this season randomly one night because I was in the middle of going thru the seasons of the Office that I own and realized I didn't have season 7. Almost as soon as I received it in the mail I started watching it (to make sure the disks were good) and realized I forgot how funny season 7 was and how sad Micheal's departure was!!,1391299200,,342,4.044117647058823

4138903,5,B003L77GDS,"I have been a huge fan of THE OFFICE ever since its first season. And, up to and including the very last episode, I am glad I did. The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.

The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.

The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.

Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.

Purists and snobs will try to argue that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-precursor-British-Series/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the precursor British Series</a>&nbsp;was better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!

The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE. No spoilers but I will just state that the show does not disappoint to the very end.

Now, how many reams of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunder-Mifflin-Premium-acid-free-paper/dp/B006CDW35O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunder Mifflin Premium acid-free paper</a>&nbsp;should I you down for?",1372550400,,3433,5.527619047619048

4139125,4,B003L77GDS,"Ah, the season we've all been dreading. After seven glorious and hilarious years, Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, is leaving for good. His farewell season isn't as strong as previous seasons, namely two through four, but still offers a lot of laughs and guest appearances. A few of the appearances to note are Kathy Bates as Jo, the head of Sabre and lover of giant dogs, Timothy Olyphant as Danny Cordray, a successful traveling businessman trying to poach clients away from Dunder Mifflin, and Will Ferrell as DeAngelo Vickers, the temporary branch manager that makes Michael look like a business guru.

The majority of the season deals with Michael's departure and who is going to take over. There's a lot of hijinks that occur as a result of potential managers that interview for the branch manager position. The final two episodes have A TON of cameos from well-known comedians, and are hilarious to watch. In true Office fashion, the Halloween and Christmas episodes are some of the best of the season, which is appropriate as they'll be Michael's last. A few other standout episodes for me include ""Andy's Play"", in which Andy is part of the community theater's rendition of Sweeney Todd, ""Threat Level Midnight"", the long overdue and hilarious feature film by Michael, ""Goodbye Michael"" as the touching and appropriate sendoff for Carell, and the two-parter ""Search Committee"" in which the office searches for Michael's replacement.

This show has always belonged to Carell, who was SO good as the incompetent boss whose awkwardness knew no bounds. I understand the desire to pursue other projects but Steve will truly be missed. I write this review a few season after the fact and can safely say that the show is not the same without him. This is a great final season for him to be featured in.

The set itself contains a lot of funny extras, including blooper reals, deleted scenes, and webisodes. The set also contains the essential extended edition of ""Threat Level Midnight.""",1360627200,2,1995,4.949253731343283

4139233,2,B003L77GDS,"This season really is all over the place. There are definitely some great episodes but there are an equal amount of straight-ahead mundane ones. The strength of this comedy-drama from series one has always been that you are laughing or feeling the tension from the drama, but with this season there are several scenes which are neither.

The big news is that Carell is leaving but this isn't nearly as much of a problem as Daniels and Schur having already left to create the infinitely tighter and insanely unpredictable Parks and Rec.

The main problem seems to be a lot of the dialogue probably reads really well on the page but needs to be streamlined big time for the small screen. There are numerous excrutiatingly long rants and monologues from various different characters which simply bog down the pace and mess with the comedic timing in general.

Even though Season Six was also wildly inconsistent due to the ridiculously high number of writers, Bates and Carell were still able to hold it all together due to their chemistry and a kind of 'mother and son' dynamic.

If they cannot get Daniels and Schur back pretty soon it may be best to quit while they are ahead.",1347235200,,1176,4.694174757281553

You have to know when things are getting stale.  The characters don't seem to have a lot of room to grow beyond where they are at, and the whole Jim and Pam romance is now turned into just another boring, middle-class couple muddling through life.  Steve Carrel tied all the characters together, and nobody can replace him.  The cameo appearances by Will Ferrel and James Spader were just painful to watch.  It's rare that you get something so right like the chemisty between the original cast.  The characters that were added later like Andy, Gabe and the stupid new receptionist were just awful and felt forced.  I was impressed with the ending as it tied up the series nicely and allowed fans to say goodbye leaving you feeling like life goes on for the characters as it does for all of us.  I wish the network would have just left it at that instead of trying to eek a few more seasons out.

4139363,4,B003L77GDS,"Season 7, at this point, is up there in my three favourite seasons which include Season 3 (for the introduction of Andy and Karen) Season 5 (for the growth of Michael's character and consistency). It nicely rounded off the Michael arc, and even had enough juice without him to carry on for an episode or three.

The Office is almost always better the second time around, which is one thing that makes this DVD collection worth purchasing, if you thought you didn't enjoy this season. Whereas Season 6 consisted of 4 or 5 excellent episodes ('Gossip', 'Murder', 'Shareholder Meeting' come to mind), it still lacked any truly interesting arcs or character development. Season 7 is one big arc devoted to character development. Some are done more messily and less consistent than others, but Andy, Darryl, Michael (primarily) and Erin are the REAL main cast, forget Dwight, Jim or Pam. Dwight, Jim and Pam are still here, but are relegated to the sidelines (and some of the worst jokes) to be used occasionally by our main characters (much like Jim and Pam used their co-workers to get closer in the earlier seasons, remembering specifically Jim's consultation with Kevin over who was better out of Karen or Pam). Dwight might be a little too wacky at times (not that I really care) but his parts are as funny as ever.

Hey, I didn't like Will Ferrell's Deangelo Vickers the first time around either. The second time I found myself warming to the character and less ready to compare him to Michael. He helped shape some of the more memorable and awkward moments of the season for me (namely the absolute crushing of Andy's dignity when he's trying to impress Deangelo, or when he truly appears psychotic screaming at and tearing a chunk out of Michael's Goodbye cake.

If you're currently watching Season 8 and think, 'christ, what are they doing?', give it a second chance on DVD (although I can't say it will save what has been an awful season, worse than even season 1 and season 6).",1334966400,,1983,4.72543352601156

4139871,3,B003L77GDS,"Season 7 is a real mess to be honest...Carell's departure inevitably overshadowed pretty much the whole season, and it is going to be very interesting to see how the show develops with its central character gone. It's a testament to how far this fantastic show has come from its English parent that the central figure can go and the show can even consider continuing - if David Brent left the English version there would not really have been a show..but the strength in depth in the US version means that there is enough there to work with.

The main problem i have with this season is the complete lack of credibility - i know that you shouldn't judge any shows, particularly sitcoms on their realism, but too many things happen in this season that prompt the reaction ""yeah but..."" to be forgivable. Things like what does Ryan actually do (surely his story arc burnt out after he lost the job at corporate and was sent to jail?). Likewise what does Gabe do and bring to the show - the characters don't regard him as the boss and the Gabe/Andy/Erin triangle is pretty unfunny - he's not been a good addition and towards the end his whining/nutter stuff is just odd. The whole Sabre thing has been quite poorly done overall - I miss David Wallace and the others at Corporate, although the Sabre storyline addressed the economic climate in Season 7 it seems things are fine and dandy in season 7 - Jim even moans about hitting his commission cap!

The pranking with Jim and Dwight is great fun, and recalls some of the earlier seasons, but at times feels bit deja vu, and you wonder whether the characters have progressed at all. Will ""Marmite"" Ferrell will divide viewers, personally i don't rate him at all, and felt his sole purpose was to keep a big name in the frame during Carell's exit. In fact the guest stars generally get in the way this season (it's well said that when a sitcom starts dropping in guests regularly alarm bells should start ringing) - Timothy Olyphant is great in his shows and then disappears completely and is therefore another ""yeah but"" which is distracting, and although i laughed at Ricky Gervais' cameo it felt very indulgent and out of place.

That's not to say that this season is all bad - there are a couple of runs of great episodes about a third through and again near the end which hopefully will lead to greater things- with Michael gone we need a new boss who has an authority figure to bounce off, and more screen time for some of the tier 3 characters like Creed - one of the weaknesses of this season was the focus on the other tier 1 characters other than Michael, but a dumbing down of some of the tier 2 like Kevin (too stupid to be believable) Angela (basically a one joke character) and Erin (cute but stupid, albeit funnier than Kevin is now). Creed and Meredith who usually provide some of the unexpected classic moments (my personal favourite's being creed blog = a word document) barely have a page worth of dialogue between them.

In terms of quality this is probably the worst season after the first (which was utterly dreadful and basically a line-for line reworking of the English version with the names changed at times). It was during seasons 2 and then with the stellar season 3 this show became a classic - Season 6 was a bit off and this is worse again; let's hope a new direction and some tighter and more realistic writing with better arcs will see this show not just limp on but reach the heights of the classic years. Michael's departure doesn't mean the end of the Office by a long chalk...",1318032000,,3558,4.511627906976744

Season 6 was inconsistent and was filled with some hilarious episodes and alot of episodes that I didn't care for at all. Season 7 is similar. The episodes that I did find to be quite funny are PDA, The Search, and Todd Packer. The rest were OK at best. To further complicate things this is also the final season featuring Steve Carell as Michael Scott. Towards the end of season 7, Will Ferrell makes appearences in 4 episodes as a potential replacement but this was a disappointment as the episodes provide for minimal laughs. In the final episodes a number of actors make guest appearences as additional candidates for the job of manager at Dunder Mifflin including Ricky Gervais as David Brent who was the manager of Wernham Hogg on the original BBC version of The Office. This got me a bit excited and led me to believe that he would eventually replace Michael. Unfortunately that was not the case. This along with Season 6 are not the best representations of the show. Seasons 1-5 were all fantastic and to any new fan of The Office I would recommend any of the first 5 rather than 6 and 7.",1317254400,10,1263,4.424892703862661
4139907,4,B003L77GDS,"SPOILERS BELOW:

This seventh season of a beloved show of mine is a hit and miss all the way, but not a bad season. After the first few astonishing and surprising minutes of the first episode of this season (where the employees ad lib to a song apparently to put a video on You Tube) I, still with my jaw fropped, thought: ""Man, this season is going to be the best ever!"". That was not the case, but the season itself was good.

There's no doubt the writers tried to be innovative (they must be, otherwise audience will fall after so many seasons of a show). But something is awkward here. The office guys are always in a party somewhere. There is no tense and gripping episode (like, for example the ""Did I stutter"" episode where Stanley challenges Michael, or the basketball game between warehouse and office guys... there are so many of them memorable episodes). They try, and it seems they always fail. The Gabe characters is weak, they turned Erin into a completely moron. Yes, she's still eye candy and I understand she is suppose to be a joy, full of life, but, making her... dumb? Didn't get it. Also, it was weird to not have some strong corporate headquartes character, like David Wallace, or Jan, or even Kathy Bates. It seemed the office has no crisis anymore, the sales are stupendous for everyone, there are no opponents.

Some plots are simply unresolved and somewhat nasty, like Dwight viciously beating Jim almost do death (exaggerating here, of course:)in Christmas party with snowballs, and Jim doing nothing to reverse the situation. Other unresolved plot is when Jim does not receive any more comissions because he reached his comission cap for the year, a fact he did not know about. Also, Timothy Olyphant character's, a top-sales man, is hired by Michael then simply dissapears from the show. Also, plausibility was thrown to the wind: Pam becomes ""Office Administrator"" using nasty tactics (be it: lying through her teeth to al her fellow job comrades). This is not the Pam we knew.

The Holly came back was reasonably well treated.

I'm not a great fun of Will Ferrell, but his performance surprised me. It was a clever decision to bring someone famous as a comedian to temporarily fill Carrell's shoes and easy the transition to the permanent new manager (who by now we all know is Andy Bernard).

Michael Scott leaving the show is not the biggest problem for me. It was clear this season that, since Michael was leaving, they tried to make him a little less despicable. Although Carrell was clearly the main character, the supporting cast is great. The trouble, for me, is the writing itselt. But I hope next season will be great.",1316995200,2,2658,4.705376344086021
4139908,5,B003L77GDS,"I was a bit skeptical about this season and giving Michael the farewell he deserves.

4139910,5,B003L77GDS,"Love this season. So many of the episodes highlight the continued talent of the writers and actors such as Nepotism, China, Ultimatum, Threat Level Midnight and Garage Sale. Throughout the season you can feel Michael being given less parts and less focus on his character. Not that we don't enjoy his antics but it makes sense and its great to see some other characters shine. I particularly enjoy Creed but who doesn't enjoy a crazy, old person. All around the development of the ensemble is great.

I know a lot of people have objected to this season because the show doesn't focus on Michael as much as it has in the past. Lets remember that the show did not phase Michael out because they were trying to cut Steve Carell out. Mr. Carell CHOSE to leave to pursue other work. We can't blame him for wanting to try something new but the lose of his character is not NBC's fault and I'm sure they are doing the best they can to maintain the unity of the show. I feel they have done a great job. There is still a little void in the show and each episode that does not have Michael in it. I eagerly await the eighth season though because I have full faith in the writers and actors that made the show so great. It was not Steve Carell's performance alone that made the show one of the most influential comedies in recent history.",1316131200,4,1327,4.372469635627531

It's sad to see Michael leave, and yes, I'm still skeptical as to how the show will hold up in Season 8, but I can't wait to find out.

Jim and Dwight's snowball fight had me in stitches, as did the Sweeny Todd production. And James Spader, wow. I forgot what an awesome actor he is.

Great DVD presentation too, btw. Funny pics, art, extras, etc.",1315612800,3,496,4.26595744680851

Although our family watches all of the episodes when they first come out and then in the after-season reruns, we love watching the DVD's in order with the deleteds.  It is amazing how much info is left out.  It is in the deleted's past years that we found out Angela keyed Andy's car and Brian Baumgartner (Kevin) is an amazing basketball player.

We will miss Michael terribly in the new season, but with these writers, we most certainly won't be disappointed.",1315526400,2,530,4.728260869565218
4140013,3,B003L77GDS,"the most recent season of the office was very similiar to season 6. it was extremely hit or miss and overall it feels underwhelming compared to the seasons that got this show off it's feet and running into everyone's heart(seasons 1-5). i will say though that season 7 did have a lot of great moments and episodes though, it's just too bad that there were a lot of really bad ones too(i was cringing and holding my stomach during the ""michael scarn"" movie episode, just terrible, tacky and it felt like i was watching a completely different show). honestly, what are the writers doing with the characters on the show? it's confusing when you see characters acting out of character and seeing them act in a manner that was against their quirks and validity in past seasons. i don't understand it. i know characters develop and change as series go forward but it's just too drastic. the evolution is not natural and i know a lot of office diehards like myself notice this as well.

the show use to use subtle, mysterious crude humor in a way that was endearing, odd and warm. where the show use to fill gaps with awkward pauses and glances is now replaced with egocentricity and pure bluntness. it was also very unnatural how daryl got promoted and the way his character is being used by the writers. .he got promoted solely due to his rising popularity a few years ago and that should be obvious to everyone. daryl use to have a stone cold expression and attitude and he would not be messed with or fooled by no one. .now he plays childish office pranks and is a softy who has emotions about every little thing or situation he's involved in?? it doesn't add up and neither does his role in the office? what is daryl again? what does he do upstairs in the office now? daryl needs to be back down in the warehouse or a job that is not in the office, he was my favorite B character on the show when he was the wharehouse foreman and his interactions with michael were absolutely hilarious but now he is not even remotely funny and he doesn't stand his ground anymore.

i think the series as a whole would have been perfect if they would ended it with the season 5 finale. that episode showed the open yet hopeful reconnection between michael and holly at the company picnic and i think it would have been GREAT if they would have left that open-ended like the way season 5 ended. you can tell there was hope, content, and a little desperation in michael's eyes at the end of the season when he was talking to the camera but everyone knew deep down they would end up together. instead, they ring it out for 2 more seasons and it started getting really old in season 7 and it just ended up being not as memorable as it would have been if they left it unanswered and unaired.

as for jim and pam, another fine example of why the show should have ended after 5 seasons. we saw them get together in season 4 and throughout seasons 4 and 5 we saw some classic, tender-hearted, hilarious moments between the famous couple but ultimately they were happy and it was still endearing up till the season 5 finale. the tension between them while pam was away at art school and then when she left to go to the michael scott paper company was the last good/interesting interactions we saw between pam and jim. seasons 6 and 7 was too cute and too adorable too much of the time and it was just boring and redundant. when season 5 ended with them finding out they were having a baby was just PERFECT. . .the reaction and the emotion was unmatched by anything post season 5 between the two. also, we saw a blooming crush and possible relationship between andy and erin at the end of season 5 which resolved the andy's faulty engagement to angela. we saw dwight stick up for angela and we sensed a resolution between the two in the future. that's about it, everything was set to be wrapped up and conflicts to be resolved with some great open ended and what if's. why couldn't the writers just leave the show on a highmark and end it at the season 5 finale?? i guess they needed to draw out more unnessecary episodes so they can put their kids through college and be able to retire by the time their 50. greedy move on the part of the writers/producers. the series could have been perfect but instead we have 5 classic seasons. . .and 3+ OK, unnessecary seasons.

obviously, the show is going on without michael and at this point i just don't know what to say. michael scott IS the office and going on without him just seems arrogant by the writers and disrespectful to michael gary scott's character and compassion he gave us the past 7 years. what are the writers trying to prove now? just end it already. however, we did see a promising cameo by james spader at the end of the season 7 and that showed promise. the uncomfortableness and awkward glances that he gave in the 2 scenes he was in is what the show had been missing the past 2 seasons. he was extremely hilarious and creepy and this would be a HUGE improvement to replace kathy bates awful and tacky character ""Jo"" with spader's roger california. season 8 might have some potentional with spader at the helm but still doesn't make up for the fact that michael is gone and their continuing without him?

all in all, the season is alot like season 6 whereas it is hit or miss and it continues on with the same type of humor and characters that seem out of sync. however, the season is worth having alone i think just due to michael scott's last season and him leaving the show. michael knew the series was over but why didn't the writers/crew know this??

here's to hoping for a redeeming, better albeit michael-less season 8.",1315267200,4,5664,4.420498084291188
4140014,1,B003L77GDS,"It really doesn't matter to me if no one agrees with my opinion of this season, because these are personal opinions and not votes for a popularity contest.

The Office has steadily declined the past three years. The character of Michael Scott, as the half-wit, half-moron, incompetent boss, was really getting old. There just weren't anymore really standout episodes that were funny. It's like the writers just ran out of ideas, and put a new (and boring) twist to an old theme. Dwight's and Andy's antics were no longer funny, and the sappy, insipid relationship (okay, marriage) of Pam and Jim, was just that - sappy and insipid. The rest of the cast were just plain boring.

The season finale could not have stunk any more than it did. What an anti-climax!  Yes, they will go on, because they need paychecks, but they'll lose more viewers to the funnier ""Parks And Recreation"" as the next season goes by. This show has really bottomed-out. Only the die-hard lover's of this show will continue watch it to its ultimate death.",1315180800,19,1027,4.758426966292135
4140015,3,B003L77GDS,"Season seven of The Office is in many ways the end of the series... well, actually in just one very major way: its Steve Carrell's last season, and without Michael Scott there is just no way the series can ever again be the same. It's not just Steve's one in a billion comedic talents that the show loses, it's also the intricately constructed dynamic between the characters. The teleplay of the entire cast that has developed into such a perfectly functioning comedy machine is something that cannot exist in the same way without Michael. The secret weapon of The Office is its spectacularly talented cast, but in a strange way, the loss of one (especially when we're talking about the main character) is enough to offset the chemistry of the entire cast. Michael Scott was the centerpiece of the ensemble, and without him, every single one of the characters loses something, whether it's their direct interaction with Michael that brought out the best in their performance while creating a one of a kind comedy team (particularly true of Jim and Dwight), or the complex balance of diverse comedic styles from one scene to the next that made each character's role seem so different and important. The talented cast may easily survive the departure of Steve Carrell, but the show can never be the same without him.
So, how does Steve's announcement to leave the series affect season seven? Well, first of all, Michael is clearly, and often awkwardly, pushed to the sidelines in order to instantly faze him out. The character that was for six seasons the driving force of every single episode is now rarely featured in the same capacity. There are very few episodes that allow him to take center stage and this hurts the show, badly. There are far more B-stories, and sometimes C-stories, that feature the rest of the cast. Sometimes this a good thing, but many episodes start to feel crowded and paradoxically, the more sub-plots given to side characters, the less time there is for them to shine as the cast begins to become fragmented. There are very few 'ensemble' eps that involve everyone in the same story. Some characters are featured way too much... Kevin for example, becomes a bit over used, and as a result he wears a little thin. The same goes for Erin. Both are great characters but season seven puts way too much pressure on them to be funny. All the while Creed is rarely even given a single line. The biggest mistake the writers make is giving a ton of screen time to Gabe, who is without a doubt the worst, most painfully unfunny character the show has ever scene. I could write another whole review just on how and why this guy is ridiculously awful.
Season Seven also features a string of guest appearances by Will Ferrell as Michael's (temporary) replacement. He fits in fairly well at first, and there are some great scenes that showcase Carrell and Ferrell as a powerhouse comedy duo, but it's hard not to wonder why the producers would bring in such a high profile guest star to share the spotlight with Steve in all of his last episodes. It may just be for ratings, but you'd think the last episodes to feature Steve Carrell would be enough to generate hype. It may be to keep the audience's interest in the show beyond Steve's departure, but, ironically, Will is only featured in one (sub-par) post-Michael episode, then the series actually gains momentum when Will is written off and the remaining original cast members take the spotlight. Whatever the reason, it's hard to resent the presence of Will Ferrell, because he has good chemistry with the cast and, well, he's funny, plain and simple. At the same time though, it's a little strange not to have a complete and total end of the season celebration of Michael, even his last episode features a Will-centric sub-plot.
Season Seven is a hard season to define. It's certainly not a bad season, there is plenty to celebrate but at the same time it makes the previous season, thought by many fans to be sub-par, look like pure gold. The episodes that do celebrate Michael are kind of hit and miss. The return of Holly Flax is a great boost to Michael's character arc, but the progression of their relationship is rushed and often pushed into the background. Dwight, on the other hand, is ace all year long; 7 is chalk full of great stories revolving around his ownership of the building. There also plenty of great stories with Jim and Dwight that do not disappoint. Andy is also hilarious all year long as he continues to get more and more well deserved screen time. Pam also gets some nice subplots as newly promoted Office Administrator.

Notable episodes include...

Nepotism- A great premiere that sets the bar high. Michael hires his worthless Nephew and Pam attempts to prank Dwight.

Christening- A great Jim and Pam story that manages to involve their daughter in a non-invasive way. Also features a great sub-plot where Michael, feeling excluded from the ceremony, impulsively boards a bus to Mexico.

Viewing Party- A Glee party at Gabe's house??? Amazingly this ep is actually really funny. Feat: another great Jim and Pam parenting sub-plot where Dwight is the only one able to calm Ceci down, Andy gets high on powdered seahorse, and Michael gets jealous and disconnects the cable.

Classy Christmas- One of the few Michael-centric episodes featuring the return of Holly Flax as well as an epic snowball war between Jim and Dwight. Possibly the best episode since season five.

Threat Level Midnight- Considered a fan-favorite by some, I personally consider this episode to be over the top and way out of character. The idea of Michael actually filming his legendary screenplay sounds funny but it doesn't really play out that way. I'd like to know how his production values could be so high that he could afford CG and massive set pieces. Also, why was the cast so eager to participate and when did they find the time?

Michael's Last Dundies- A classic written by the great Mindy Kaling. I can't think of a better way to end Michael Scott's tenure at the office than another episode revolving around the Dundies.

Goodbye Michael- An emotional and hilarious send-off to the world's greatest boss, expertly written by Greg Daniels (making you wonder if the series would have had more stamina if he wrote more than just one post-season-4-episode a year). It has the energy and pacing of the show's earlier seasons,  as well as a few very satisfying call backs.

Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager- A tremendous episode that allows Dwight to run away with the spotlight. Steve's presence is missed but this ep proves that the show can in fact still be great without him.

The Search Committee- Another surprisingly high-energy, high quality post-Carrell ep featuring a plethora of entertaining cameos from Ray Ramano to Warren Buffett. A very promising prequel to season eight.

Though starting to drift farther and farther away from its prime, The Office is still relatively excellent throughout season seven. A must have for all fans, especially since it is Michael's last. And though the show will go on, Michael will always be missed. He had a had a great run. But as great as it was, it didn't last nearly as long as it should have... That's what she said.",1315180800,64,7253,4.779728651237031
4140016,3,B003L77GDS,"The first 100-odd episodes of The Office (US) rank among the greatest television of the last 20 years; I'll have fond memories (and the episodes to re-watch) of those five seasons forever. However, the last couple of years have suffered from some sort of decline. Season 7 was a little better than the minor travesty that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-Season-Six/dp/B002N5N5SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office: Season Six</a>, but I think this is probably where the series should end. It's not necessarily even that the show needs Steve Carell to be funny, as the episode after 'DeAngelo Vickers' (who was probably the low point of the season) left was one of the best this year; I just think they've run out of gas.

This isn't exactly surprising; after all, the number of TV shows that can have 7 seasons and 150 episodes without some sort of decline can be counted on one hand. The Office gave us some great, great episodes and was actually pretty entertaining this year-- but it's time to let go. I don't know if I'm going to tune in next year, but for the first time in years I don't think it'll be worth it. It's been a great run, that much is certain.

High Points of S7 (spoilers for the rest of the review) :

""PDA"": Michael and Holly are dating now. Three seasons' worth of sexual tension have been resolved, for the most part. But according to Dunder-Mifflin rules, they can't publicly display their affection wantonly around the office. They are dismayed. This episode wasn't much in the grand scheme of things, but it was enjoyable and funny in the way that The Office was way back in the good ol' days.

""Garage Sale/Goodbye, Michael"": Some parts of these episodes did irk me a little, but overall I liked the sentimental reception Michael received as he prepared to leave. ""Goodbye, Michael"" expertly managed this, as it avoided the huge musical-number type sendoff I was fairly certain he would recieve for a more understated and, ultimately, touching exit for Michael Scott.

""Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager"": Sure, there was the wildly outlandish gun injury Dwight gave Andy, but the episode did show me that the series could be funny w/o Michael Scott. It was funny, and that's all I can say.

Other fairly good episodes: ""The Sting"", ""China"", ""Classy Christmas"", ""Ultimatum""

Bad Points:

""The Inner Circle"": DeAngelo Vickers is the absolute worst character/plotline/anything The Office has ever even hinted at bringing into the show. (Slight hyperbole, I'll admit.) He may have had one line that got a half-hearted chuckle out of me, but mostly he was just a black hole of funny. He didn't really bring anything to the show, served only as a ratings draw (and not a very good one, to boot) and was more of a mass of odd character traits than anything resembling a character. His exit in ""Inner Circle"" was especially dreadful, as the writers apparently decided to just put him in a coma after forcing us to sit through his terrible plotlines for four episodes. His time-wasting sideplot in ""Goodbye, Michael"" was also bad. In a word, DeAngelo Vickers was terrible.

""Christening""/: The increasing trend of episodes where everyone in the office meet outside of work for a social function is one example of the show's decline; do they really expect us to believe that these people who are mostly apathetic/antagonistic to each other during the 9 hours they are forced to spend near each other want to spend so much time together outside of work? I mean, having everyone in the office show up for J/P's baby's christening is pretty far-fetched--
but they also go to Andy's play, and watch Glee together, and all agree to star in Michael's movie? One or two would be ok, but that's quite far-fetched.

""Michael's Last Dundies"": A choreographed musical number for a boss that had embarrassed, belittled and generally aggravated them for the last 7+ years? I can accept a lot (Michael's proposal in 'Garage Sale', for one), but that was too much. I mean, he egged Toby's house and demeaned him at the Dundies in that same episode-- but he still sung ""Seasons of Love"" for him? Bit much.

4140017,4,B003L77GDS,"The DVD disk-set for season 7 is up to par with the clarity and volume of the previous seasons, which is good. There are 24 episodes on 5 disks in this season, and the extras in this set include the re-enactment of Scott's ""Threat Level Midnight"" play, webisodes of ""The Accountants"", deleted scenes, bloopers and commentaries. I believe the extras are longer and better than in the previous two sets.
The show in season seven is better than in seasons 5-6, in my opinion. Much has been written here about the contents of the episodes, but suffice it for me to say that I found Scott less annoying and ridiculous than in the last two seasons, and it was nice to see Dwight brought back up to the foreground of a few episodes as well.
*SPOILERS*
 I am NOT a Ferrel-fan and so am relieved he did not stay. Season 7 is basically just more of season 6, with only one goal...to release Scott.  The later episodes in season 7 seem to just drag the ""Is Michael Scott going to leave with Holly?"" bit.  The Departure of Gabe was a disappointment for me as I enjoyed his character. It was great to see Oscar get some limelight. Kelly Kapur's devlopment is interesting and funny and I enjoyed her character in this season, as in all other seasons. Finally, a long-awaited good-riddance to that dreadful character 'Packer'.

This season is all right. Michael and Holly are back together in this season. I really liked this season for that. Michael has been through a lot of hard times with his love life; super hard! That's what she said! His goal for every season was to find a woman that he can settle down with and start a family with. He finally got it. Holly is that woman and they are great for each other. They left the office together and will live happily ever after....so it seems...lol You never know...maybe they'll come back in season 8. Maybe, if there's a season 9...who knows.

Will Farrell performance in the show was good. The writers just made his character very bad. I like Will Farrell to be really funny and silly. In The Office, he isn't that at all. He was tone down too much. He looked like he would break out and start making me laugh, but that didn't happen. Instead he was kind of duh and boring to watch. I just kept on watching to see if he would make me laugh at some point, but that didn't happen. He just played a regular old tough boss character. He wasn't like a silly, funny, or sometimes crazy boss like Michael was. So, you shouldn't expect that kind of laughter from Farrell here. The only time he did something crazy caused him to leave the show, which the writers wanted.

I like how finally Jim and Pan are married, but they are a boring married couple with a baby now. I think it would had been better if they were just married, but not with a baby yet. The writers could had played up how being married isn't all too great in the beginning. Then, later on, they have a baby and it's all happy times again. But, they didn't do that so it's just a family with family problems story. In the show, they keep on talking about their baby in almost every episode. It doesn't really interest me very much. Blah, Blah, Blah. In one episode, when Farrell was on the show, Pam wanted to show Farrell's character a picture of her baby during a meeting. I liked how Farrell put down his foot and stopped her from disrupting the meeting and showing him the picture. Who really needs to see that? Another example, was in another show, were Pam wanted to show pictures to Andy of a new office building, but he thought she was just showing him pictures of her baby. He didn't look at the pictures and kept on working, while pretending to look at the pictures. ha ha ha That's how I feel when I start seeing a Jim/Pan/baby part in the show. Next story please!

What I find interesting now is plot with Aaron, Andy, and Gabe. Gabe is the character that I really hate seeing with Aaron and I want to see her with Andy. That's what's drawing me to watching the show. That's the same set up in the earlier seasons with Pan, Roy, and Jim. A 3-way love triangle with the third person being the person that I want to see in the couple.

If history does repeats itself, then in the show, Aaron and Andy will most likely end up being together. They already set it up in season 7 for that to happen. Also, they might even get married. This is probably the only real reason why I will keep on watching the show. For the next season, you might want to know who will be the new manager of the office. That's sort of interesting, but I rather see the Andy and Aaron situation.",1309737600,,3285,4.28341384863124
4140020,5,B003L77GDS,"Season 7 of The Office is one of the funniest seasons I have ever seen. I never bought the whole critique of the past two seasons. I thought they were great and stuck to the true nature of the show. Every season has been terrific and season 7 continues the annual tradition of raising the bar. I am a big Will Ferrell fan (Stepbrothers and The Other Guys are my two favorite comedies) so I was thrilled to see him star in that episode arc. Michael's shenanigans have been hysterical but it's good to see that the writers are able to still craft hilarity without the 40 Year-Old Virgin running the office. Just today, in fact, I watched the Search Committee episodes and laughed so hard at Creed's Boboddy acronym.
Season 7 is terrific by all means. Although not every episode is equally funny, I don't feel that this fact should bother anyone. Although The Office is a comedy, character development and story arcs are important to any show, no matter what genre, so it was good to see that the creators kept that in mind and didn't try to pack laughs in where laughs weren't needed. All in all, I feel very good about this show as it enters into its 8th season and cannot wait to watch all the episodes again and again ad nauseum. Perhaps it's cliche or inappropriate, but haters gon hate, so if you love the office but were unable to watch this season, trust the positive reviews rather than the negative ones and watch/buy season 7 when you can!",1309564800,2,1447,4.464150943396226
4140021,2,B003L77GDS,"I'll start by saying The Office is probably my all-time favorite comedy. My problem with this season (and the end of last) is that the realistic nature of the show is gone. All the characters are completely over the top and unbelievable, and it just doesn't suck me in. I think if you just started watching it in the past year or so, you might not notice this and like the new episodes, but it's not the same show I became a huge fan of. The whole premise of the show is a documentary of a real office, with believable things happening (to a degree...i mean, it is a TV show after all). In the episode where Dwight is acting manager, he accidentally shoots a gun into the ground, but isn't fired or even reprimanded. Seriously? Compare that with earlier seasons when Michael quoted a racially inappropriate skit from Chris Rock, and he got in trouble for that...but Dwight doesn't get in trouble for firing a loaded weapon. Like I said - the show started of as something very believable, and now it's just a TV show going for a cheap laugh. I knew I was going to be unhappy from the opening of the season with the whole dancing/YouTube thing they did. Most of the episodes I shut off half way through because I was so uninterested in what was going on.

I think this show made a big mistake putting Pam and Jim together so early AND making their relationship go so perfectly once they did. How boring is it that they get along so great? It sums up the show's path in general, and what another reviewer said - the show used to be a drama with comedy naturally coming from the characters interactions. I used to tune in every week to find out what was going to happen...and also laugh my butt off in the process. Now it's just a bunch of jokes without purpose and significant context.

That said - the writers got their act together for Michael's final episode. It was hands down the best episode in the past 2 years, and was just well done all around. The writers made me feel like I was personally saying goodbye to Michael. Not to mention Michael and Jim's goodbye was one of the best scenes the show has ever done. Then Michael mouthing ""that's what she said"" after taking off his microphone pack...absolutely brilliant. To me, that episode was the end of the series. Here's to hoping they bring back Michael for the actual finale and send the show off right.",1309132800,14,2361,4.412844036697248

4140104,4,B003L77GDS,"I'm torn on my opinion of the Office Season 7.

On one level, there are the truly excellent episodes, from ""Threat Level Midnight"" to the ""Herpes"" episode which was full of cameos.  The ""PDA"" episode and ""The Search"" really show how good of an actor both Steve Carrell and Amy Ryan are, and manage to be funny and quite heartfelt at the same time.  Holly, one of my favorite characters, comes back, and Jo is absent from almost the entire season, which is a definite plus, though she did have her moments in the two hour finale.  Michael Scott's final episode was wonderful, and there were some hilarious spots in almost every episode.

However, I used the word ""almost"" in the last paragraph for a reason.  ""China"", ""Viewing Party"", ""the Inner Circle"" and ""Christening"" were, on the whole, pretty terrible episodes from my point of view.  ""Classy Christmas"" and ""The Seminar"" weren't far behind.  On some of them, I kept waiting for something to make me laugh, and there wasn't any payoff.  The whole middle of this season was basically a train wreck that made me almost want to turn off my television mid-episode.  I'm a harsh critic when it comes to the Office, if only because I know what the show is capable of creating, and the magic definitely left the building mid-season.

It got slightly more appealing to watch some of the later episodes, which would, of course, be some of Steve Carrell's last.  He puts on a tour de force of three or four superior episodes leading up to his finale that could only be brought down by the talent, or lack thereof, of Will Farrell.  I've never been the least bit interested in the one character that he seems to play in every appearance, TV or on the big screen, and I can't say that I'm at all happy that he blemished five episodes of one of my favorite TV series here.  Whether he's completely over-the-top or so subdued you hardly even notice him, the writing department clearly doesn't know whether they should use him as Michael Scott 2 or someone completely different, and needless to say, I was very relieved when he was gone.  Those episodes as a whole, though, were excellent, saved by the superior cast of the show and Steve Carrell's genius.

But ever since Season 3 started, the Office has been more about the developing storylines of the characters than the comedy, which comes naturally as a result of the interactions between the strong and distinct personalities.  Andy and Gabe get significant screen time, which is a plus, and unfortunately, Erin is drawn into this as well.  I don't know what to think about her.  At times, she's cute and innocent, like a younger Pam, while at others, she's just so stone-cold stupid that I can't stand her.  Two of the best moments of the season put her at the center of events, though, when she calmly announces that Holly can't be Michael's girlfriend because she isn't good-looking enough, and when she breaks up with Gabe on stage at the Dundies, part 2, which was very reminiscent of the classically awkward moments that defined earlier seasons.  Overall, I simply hope they find some consistency with her instead of trying to make her a Pam/Kevin hybrid.

The other character who is bothering me this season is Darrell, who used to just be the fun loving guy downstairs and a chance for Michael to make some off-color racial remarks to.  Now that he's upstairs, he's lost his fun element, and he's just another body.  A body who seems to be taking a lot of screen time away from the other, funnier and more interesting characters who have all but disappeared.

While it's obvious that much of the focus of the show has to settle around Michael Scott because of his departure, I think it's inexcusable to completely ignore Creed (until the final episode), Meredith, Stanley, Toby, and Phyllis, who combined might have twenty-six lines of dialog in all 26 episodes.  For a large part of the beginning of the season, Jim and Pam are there for some one-liners, and absent otherwise.  Some of the characters seem almost like parodies of their former selves.  This is particularly evident in  Kevin and Angela, the former being a little too inept to be believable, and the latter basically being transformed into a one-joke punchline.  The strange thing about Angela is that her story in Season 7 actually has a lot of promise, but is almost completely ignored (she's unknowingly acting as the beard to the gay state senator, in case you forgot since you rarely see or hear from her).

I guess overall the biggest thing that Season 7 is lacking is continuity.  Hopefully this will get a whole lot better now that Steve Carrell is officially gone, and all of the backstage drama and shenanigans of writing him out of the show has come to an end.  Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Scott, and will miss him greatly, but the season as a whole struggled because of him.  Hopefully, the writing team can focus on getting the show back on track, and hopefully, it will be done without the need to keep introducing new members to the Dunder Mifflin/Sabre team we all know and love.  The guest stars were getting on my nerves.

That was one of the best episodes of The Office there's ever been. I love all of The Office episodes, but this stood above the rest. It had the typical humor, though definitely toned down, but it also was genuinely moving. I loved the way that Michael said goodbye to everyone, and the way that he acted in the end. He didn't try to make a big deal out of it, and even decided to have a party for the people that were still in the office. It was nice to see that Michael had changed, but that he still retained much of his ""immature"" shenanigans. He even said goodbye to Toby. His goodbyes to the staples of the show--Dwight, Jim, and Pam--were seriously moving. His recommendation letter and last paintball; and his lunch with Jim that would never come...both amazing. It sucks that Steve Carell chose to leave the show. I imagine the actual goodbyes were as emotional as the show's.
I don't know how the next episode and coming seasons will be able to live up to this episode. It will be interesting to see who replaces Steve Carell, and if he can come close to filling Carell's shoes.

8399487,2,B003L77GDS,"I just loved this whole series, but season 7 was probably my least favorite.  There is so much that is absurd in this season.  The part I hated most were the episodes with Will Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers.  What a stupid story line.  I am not a Will Ferrell fan anyway, he totally leaves me cold, but he is really obnoxious in this.  The character is given a name that some people might identify as a classic black name-DeAngelo Jeremetrious Vickers, which could lead to a hilarious racial issue for Michael and could explain why Michael never suspects that the guy in the bar is his replacement.  But no one in four episodes every says a word about that.  The character himself is an idiot, which fits well, but what could have been a really funny story arc goes nowhere in my opinion.  I was sort of glad to see him end up in a coma at the end.

Many people have a lot of complaints about Jim and Pam, but their relationship is about the only thing that rings true this season.  Most great love stories, if the couple goes on and gets married, is going to end up with just a regular couple living a life that is not really fun and interesting to anyone but them.  I think they are sweet and very realistic. Other characters, however.....Dwight is always fabulous, but Kevin?  Ridiculous, unrealistic, insulting. Angela is usually great, but she's pretty boring this season.  Andy is an idiot and Erin is just silly.  Ryan outlived his usefulness two seasons before, and Kelly needs to be put out of our misery.  There really could have been so much more accomplished this season.",1518566400,,1581,4.4982456140350875
