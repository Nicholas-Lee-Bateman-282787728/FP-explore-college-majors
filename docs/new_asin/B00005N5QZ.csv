Poison was a terrific blend of suspense, sex, seduction, and revenge. Some more time could have been spent developing the beginning and a few other places, but it is really no big deal in this case.
This movie is the story of a wife out for revenge on the people she deems responsible for her husband's demise. And yeah, they really had it coming to them and it felt good to watch Kari slither in and coldly and decisively do what needed to be done.",1070841600,9,545,4.25
1628058,5,B00005N5QZ,"Poison is not a great movie, but it so entertaining that it doesn't matter.  Kari Wuhrer plays a young gal whose husband commits suicide after being fired from his job.  After learning from her husband's former boss that the company had hired someone to replace him long before he was even fired because he wasn't a good worker, Kari's character snaps (she blames the company for her hubby's death).  She then decides to exact revenge; first on the boss guy, and then on the woman who replaced her husband (played by soap star Barbara Crampton).
Poison is dark, sexy, and a lot of fun as well.  There are a couple of instances where the acting could be a bit better (such as the Garrett's original housekeeper and their daughter) but Kari Wuhrer and Barbara Crampton make up for that.  The pacing is quick, the death scenes well done, and there's enough nudity to please any fan of skin (you eventually see every female character in various stages of undress...although it looked like Ms. Crampton may have used a body double).
The DVD features Audio Commentary from the director, cast bios, original trailer, and photo gallery.  The picture in in 1.85:1 widescreen and it is pristine and crystal clear.  The audio is offered in 5.1 and 2.0 surround sound.  The 5.1 mix is good.  Loud where it should be, and the surround channels are used occasionally for emphasis.
Overall, a good choice for purchase or rental.",1058400000,45,1413,4.73469387755102
1628059,2,B00005N5QZ,"Someone once said that there are only five or six real stories and writers have just been recycling them for the past 10,000 years.  Exhibit A: Kari Wuhrer Poison, a pretty-blatant rip off of the Shannon Tweed movie Scrorned.
Ann (WUHRER~!) is seeking revenge for her husband against the Garrett's, a nice, suburban family if ever there was one.  She moves in as their nanny and begins to seduce 3/4 of the family.  There's the problem right there.  I can think of atleast three better ways of getting revenge than letting them have sex with Kari Wuhrer.  In fact, that's really more of a reward.
Taking into account that it's a rip-off, it's actually better than the movie it copies.  I'll take Kari over Shannon seven days a week and twice on Sunday.  The few suspenseful parts are actually suspenseful (the freezer in the garage pops to mind), and the pool scene is the hottest since Phoebe Cates in Ridgemont High.
Kari can do better, but she got her name in the title and that's something usually reserved for John Carpenter.  This is not a bad way to spend 90 m. if you can get past the predictability.",1018483200,5,1108,4.5606060606060606
1628060,5,B00005N5QZ,"I personally am a huge kari wuhrer fan and have bought all her movies simply to find the best nude/sex scene with her in it.  This movie could have been way better but there is one scene where kari seduces the son that is simply fantastic.  Yes she gets naked, yes she has sex with him, yes its worth the whole movie for this scene alone.  Buy it if you are a collector.",1003795200,34,370,4.041095890410959

1628064,2,B00005N5QZ,This is not an altogether bad movie it just almost is.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Probably the worst part is the directing and camera work.,1357862400,,139,4.3076923076923075
1628065,5,B00005N5QZ,"I liked this movie pretty much and the story was somewhat very interesting. Kari Wuhrer played the role of a scorned wife who's husband committs suicide after being fired from his job. Afterwards, the plot thickens and gets more and more exciting because this is where Kari's poison starts kicking in and causing some brutal damage. It's a fascinating murder thriller that will keep you entertained till the end. BEAUTY COULDN'T BE MORE DEADLIER.",1353628800,2,446,5.04054054054054
1628066,5,B00005N5QZ,"Okay, Kari Wuhrer has been easy on the eyes ever since I'd first seen her and I've followed her career as closely as I can.  The movie here is not at all bad, but there is an element of predictability involved in the plot: man has hot wife and good job, man loses job and then his life, grief stricken wife sets out to get even for her loss by any means necessary.  This one almost parodies Shannon Tweed's 'Scorned', but the end results were way different.  All in all, worth a watch and if you're a Kari Wuhrer fan it's worthy of your library.",1323648000,4,545,4.171428571428572
1628067,5,B00005N5QZ,I LOVE my murder mysteries and this movie is no exception.  I've watched it time and again.  Perfectly written for the small screen.,1217116800,,132,4.695652173913044
1628068,3,B00005N5QZ,"Some great scenes of Kari and 2 other women, but the plot is a bit plodding and the story line is hard to understand. If you are looking for skin, this film has 2 decent scenes, but nothing else to recommend it.",1196467200,,211,4.0476190476190474
1628069,4,B00005N5QZ,As a huge Kari Wuhrer fan the movie was already good. The story was good for a b movie. I enjoyed it and would recomend watching it. Owning it is a different story. Since it's out of print you will pay between $15-$20 for it. If your a fan then I would buy it.,1170288000,2,260,3.8333333333333335

7946136,2,B00005N5QZ,This movie was a rip off of 1994's A Woman Scorned with Shannon Tweed.  It had the same formulaic story plot: a man who commits suicide over a work-related issues which of course leaves his wife emotionally scorned.  Distraught she seeks revenge against the family of the individual she holds responsible.  She does this by posing at a maid/housekepper of the family in order to tear them apart from the inside; mostly sleeping with them first.  Still was eye candy seeing Kari Wuhrer as the scorned lady.,1518652800,,505,4.7701149425287355
7946137,3,B00005N5QZ,"Awful movie in every way except for the WAY sexy wife who wants revenge. And that was good enough for me to watch it :)

Heck, I'll watch a sequel :)

More holes than a piece of Swiss cheese and a horribly funny ending.

But I wish she was my nanny when I grew up :)",1512259200,,266,3.7142857142857144
7946138,1,B00005N5QZ,It's a rip off of the 90s revenge plot that is apart of the Poison Ivy movie franchise and the revenge seems to happen in like 3 days. It's a waste of time if you remeber plots like these.,1510272000,,188,3.8461538461538463
