8639899,5,B00I8RS1EE,The DVD played just fine.  It is in black and white but I felt the quality was pretty good considering when it was filmed.  This film marked the introduction of Slim Pickens.  I liked the action but was sad at the ending.,1508716800,,221,4.214285714285714
8639900,4,B00I8RS1EE,"A good western, much better than most. I generally do not like Errol Flynn's acting, his smiles seem false to me, but in this film he is very serious and acts very well. He plays a rebel captain at the near end of the Civil War. He is sent by General Lee to California to gather together a new army of rebel soldiers from the southern sympathizers there. He has with him six young soldiers, one is only 16 who came with his dog, and an old man. They are supposed to meet up with a thug who is a rebel sympathizer who has a gang of about 60 men and who will aid him in gathering hundreds more. He runs into some difficulties. He and his men rescue a woman from Indians. She is the fiance of a Union lieutenant who also comes to rescue her with less than half a dozen men. This causes two problems. Flynn and the woman become attracted to each other and Flynn is now faced with a battle with Union forces. Also, the two groups are soon surrounded by hundreds of Indians who are furious because Flynn's men killed two of the chief's sons.",1504483200,,1035,4.154228855721393
8639901,4,B00I8RS1EE,"A surprisingly downbeat Western from the tail end of the Warner Bros. studio system, ""Rocky Mountain"" (1950) boasts one of Errol Flynn's finest performances while taking full advantage of its New Mexico locations. Winston Miller's taut screenplay (based on the Alan Le May story ""Ghost Mountain"") and Ted McCord's moody cinematography bring out the best in Warner contract director William Keighley, whose vigorous work elevates the picture far above its programmer status. The emphasis on gritty naturalism elicits an understated, world-weary portrayal from Flynn  markedly different from his previous screen roles. Lost in the shuffle among the star's more lavish productions, ""Rocky Mountain"" is worth rediscovering. Flynn's last Western . . . and Slim Pickens' first.",1503964800,3,771,5.646551724137931
8639902,5,B00I8RS1EE,"Rocky Mountain is in my movie library. Its a 1950 western. The first time I watched it it wasn't hard to notice that Flynn was aging badly and that his star was in decline. That being said, I will also say that Rocky Mountain is right up there with all of Flynn's westerns. The story is great, the acting is great and its based on a true story from the Civil War",1502236800,,362,4.041666666666667
8639903,5,B00I8RS1EE,"""Rocky Mountain"" is an overlooked little gem of a Western. Unlike the sprawling ""San Antonio"" and ""Dodge City,"" this one is much more intimate, allowing for character development and a degree of introspection. Yet, it is also full of terrific action sequences will satisfy even the most picky Western fan.

Set in the mountains of California towards the end of the War Between the States, Flynn is cast as the leader of a band of seven Confederate soldiers who have been sent west to create a major disturbance, perhaps ally and link up with  the large pro-Confederate underground in California, maybe even raise Indian turmoil. From the beginning Flynn realizes how desperate his mission will be. Each of the seven is given an opportunity to, as it were, ""tell his story."" Matters become complicated when a runaway stage, chased by warring Shoshone Indians, enters their midst, and one of the passengers, Patrice Wymore, becomes Flynn's prisoner.

As matters continue the mission becomes increasingly an impossibility---Flynn sees that: with him and his small band this last effort to save the ""lost cause,"" now appears doomed. Yet, he and his men will do one small final thing, one last act of courage and nobility----they will divert the Indians away so that Wymore can make an escape.

They recognize that what they will be doing is virtual suicide. Yet, they make that choice consciously; this last time they will demonstrate the honor of their region, the South, And the final scene---a remarkable charge of the seven against what appears the entire Shoshone nation, followed by the earned respect from a Yankee patrol that arrives too late to save them---is quite dramatic and moving.

Of course, ""Rocky Mountain"" was released during an ""era of good feeling,"" the early 1950s, when the American nation believed in respecting  and honoring the veterans of both sides of the War Between the States. In more recent years, that unity and respect has seemingly disappeared. Yet, this fine little film is an excellent example of that earlier mood.

And, even on a strictly entertainment level, prescinding from considerations about the War or current politics, ""Rocky Mountain"" succeeds extremely well, and pays re-viewing. It offers solid contributions from Flynn, Wymore, Slim Pickens, and ""little Dickie"" Jones, whose dog Spotty nearly steals the show....watch for him at the end. I really think he sheds a tear!

Great Warner Bros. black & white print. Highly recommended.",1496275200,3,2477,5.1138613861386135
