535337,5,6303027016,"Robin Williams is exceptional (as usual) as the controversial radio disc-jockey Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Vietnam during the war to lift the military morale with his special brand of on-air banter.  Cronauer's  improvised, lightning-speed monologues keep getting him into strife with  his superiors, yet are adored by the soldiers who avidly listen to him.  While stationed in the war-torn country, Cronauer meets and gets to know  some of the locals intimately, and learns about the catastrophes and  disasters that lie beneath the airwaves through which his flippantly  humourous broadcasts are transmitted.
Cronauer's radio persona is an  accurate mirror of Williams himself, yet he also portrays well the man who  becomes more human and vulnerable as a result of his exposure to the  situation in his new  environment.
GMV is both side-splittingly  hilarious, touching and at times devastating, as we witness the horrors of  war contrasted against the light-hearted satirical entertainment of  Cronauer's on-air speeches.  There has also never been a more ironic use of  Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"" than here, played as a  background to a heartbreaking montage of tragic images.
The soundtrack is  also excellent, blending some appropriately upbeat period tunes with  snippets of Williams funniest monologues.",914630400,32,1333,5.50990099009901

535603,5,6303027016,"Great movie with many twists and turns, one of William's best, movie shows chaos of guerrilla warfare with a very humorous dj, Adrian Cronower. In 1965 there may have been the censorship on rock and rock but by 68 we became the first rock n roll Army, and listened to US Armed Forces network which was certainly censoring mthe news and drug and psychadelic music, but allowed a lot of it too because the authorities knew we wouldn't listen to the radio if they censored everything. There was an underground of censored music like Ravi Shankar, Vanilla Fudge, by Dylan, Hendrix, The Beatles, Country Joe and the fish, etc., and after work we'd roll up a fat one and dig the Doors 'Break it on throuh to the Other Side'. There's only one thing missing and that's a lot of red sand; everything is too clean, and really everything was covered with a sheen of red dust. I love this movie and again compliment Williams and the great cast for such an outstanding story, funnier than hell, usually. War actually does have a huorus side to it at times.",1510963200,2,1043,4.523809523809524

535679,3,6303027016,"Remember that as you watch this film and even vaguely wonder why the US was out there stopping bad North Vietnam from invading South Vietnam. As for the quality of the movie itself--Williams's personality predominates. It really is mostly a one-man show though it has rather convincing scenery that feels like real Vietnam. The supporting cast is mostly a-ok as well. But the film lives only with Williams. It is almost all built around him.

PS For more on how bad North Vietnam was check out book ""South Vietnamese Soldiers"" here at amazon. Despite the title it will show much of NV's terrible cruelties.",1508198400,,606,4.826923076923077

536301,5,6303027016,"Robin Williams masterpiece.  Good Morning, Vietnam is Williams tribute to Adrian Cronauer, an airman in the USAF working for AFRTN, the Armed Forces Radio and Television Network during Vietnam.

Cronauer was the voice of AFRTN to so many during Vietnam.  His unorthodox approach to radio broadcasting endeared him to the common ground pounders, the real people fighting the war.  Cronauer made the intolerable tolerable.

This movie isn't politically correctly by any means but it is a laugh and a half.  This truly is Williams' best work.",1476403200,,539,5.209302325581396

536613,5,6303027016,"Robin Williams delivers as the ""every man"" GI with a special gift at reaching through his microphone to uplift the young GIs doing their duty on foreign shores, in a no-win war.  The music picks are outstanding at recalling the '60s; the countryside of Viet Nam is lush and green; the rank-and-file so tender of age, yet so terribly seasoned to their tasks.  It's a must-see journey back in time that captures a segment of our era.  How Williams brings laughter to our boys brings tears to my eyes, each and every time I watch this special movie.  In the midst of all the memorable rock-n-roll tunes is my personal all-time favorite, Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World""--""a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma"", as I know it was meant to be.  Speaks to how vital each one of us is, in the framework of time and space...even in, perhaps especially in, a war zone.",1456272000,2,880,4.579617834394904

536638,2,6303027016,"For $10, you get a fabulous movie that has incredible comedy and political commentary.  It's really one of the best movies I've seen of Robin Williams, which is a bold statement considering how many movies this incredible actor has done.  He's really fabulous in so many, but this isn't just about him - he has a wonderful ensemble team that he also works with.  The storyline is also great and moves the movie along with a pleasurable pace.

But this review is more about what comes with the bluray which is so disappointing.  Reportedly, there were HOURS of Robin Williams doing improv on his material, which only accounted for something like 19 minutes of the film.  IF you're going to have it on a bluray, which technically has SO MUCH memory, why not put the improv on there?!?!!  Not one sliver of it was put on the bluray.  There wasn't even a director commentary track on the bluray.  This is suppose to be the 25th anniversary version!?!?!?  Seriously!?!??!

So disappointing.  But it's one of those movies I've always wanted to own but never bought on VHS or DVD.  For me, the bluray purchase is a great buy since it's not replacing an older format.  But as far as the features are concerned, I was a victim of disappointment.",1455062400,8,1236,4.610091743119266

536910,3,6303027016,"one of Robin william's best films ever GMV (Good morning vietnam)
still extremely funny 25 years later
very tragic loss Robin william's was one of kind
the original dvd release had 1:85:1 ratio with only a 5.1 Dolby surround sound mix
plus special features, PRODUCTION DIARY which is a 35min retrospective featurette on the film
which has interviews with Director Barry Levinson, producers Mark Johnson & Larry brezner
plus only some of the Actors from the film are interviewed, with the exception of Robin williams
for some reason he was not interviewed for the dvd release
there'a also RAW MONOLOGUES aswell
which are lots of outtakes and deleted scenes of Robin williams
doing more sketch Jokes that did not make it in the final cut of the film
and the original Theatrical trailer & Teaser trailer aswell
but that's it
for this new blu-ray version Touchstone home ent' are calling it 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION
it has the exact same content as the very old DVD release
same special features have been carried over, so there are no new extras of course
a new tribute featurette to Robin william's would've been Great, but Touchstone did not bother
Touchstone did make an effort with the new HD transfer & the sound quality actually
the new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio does look excellent, very sharp & clear picture quality better then the old dvd version
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix, again better than the old dvd sound quality
but that's all you get
so if you have the very old dvd version, time to upgrade to this new blu-ray version
5 stars for the film, about 3 stars for this new blu-ray based on new HD transfer & new 5.1 mix
so time to upgrade from the old dvd version",1439510400,,1680,4.6033333333333335

He'll have you rolling around on the floor laughing & memorizing fantastic lines from the movie forever. The supporting cast helps to add depth to the story, but Robin is really a veteran of hilarity. And underneath it all, there's the pervasive presence of a sad time of war & strife.",1439337600,,369,4.507462686567164

536915,1,6303027016,"This movie is based on the true story of an US Air Force man transferred from Crete to Vietnam in 1965 to be the new DJ of the US Army radio station, and when he goes on the air for the first time, he refuses to follow the dull format of the previous DJ or play the dull music that had been played. In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.

A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clichd, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?

I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier.",1439164800,,1306,4.326530612244898

The humour is outstanding (the ""VP is a VIP"" sketch is priceless), and the personal conflicts are handled superbly. Yes, there's some language and a few scenes with sexual innuendo. But the story is about soldiers in a war zone, fighting both the enemy and the idiots within the military organization itself. And the way both sets of conflicts are addressed and resolved is outstanding.",1431648000,,450,4.934210526315789

537228,5,6303027016,"The beauty of this movie is that it allows a comedian to play a dramatic role that happens to be hilarious. Yes, Robin plays the funny man on the Armed Forces Radio system, but the drama is that he is so young, just getting started out, that he doesn't know what is going on around him.

When I first saw this film decades ago, I didn't understand much of what I saw. This time, however, the film made better sense, partially, perhaps, because I watched the various commentary tracks first.

I wonder, if I had been in his shoes, would I have been able to see the trouble that I was getting into before Robin's character did?

I recommend watching this movie at least once every five years.",1431648000,,690,4.375
537229,2,6303027016,"Not really a movie in the sense of plot, characters, etc.  Rather a vehicle for Robin Williams to deliver his trademark monologues. The plot, such as it is, is embarrassingly bad.",1431475200,,179,4.774193548387097
537230,3,6303027016,"Released in late 1987 when Vietnam films were popular, Good Morning, Vietnam chronicles the real-life story of Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) as a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When hes off the air Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauers friend at the station while J.T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.

While categorized as a war comedy, Good Morning, Vietnam is more of a war drama with amusing touches, simply due to Williams antics. The film was a box office hit when it was released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago  27 years after its release  far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent at best, although somewhat amusing. An example of the film's limitations can be seen when Cronauer performs in the presence of the troops in the second half; the sequence is somehow unconvincing. Nevertheless, theres an unexpected twist in the third act that piqued my interest and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to films like 1986s Platoon in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict.

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Thailand.

Robyn plays the hilarious Adrian Cronauer, a DJ for Armed Forces Radio. Tung Thanh Tran plays his close Vietnamese friend Tuan. Clintara plays Tuan's sister Trinh.

There is a scene near the end of the movie which illustrates the situation during the Vietnam War. It turns out that Tuan is Viet Cong and that he bombed a bar. Robyn finds out and says, nearly in tears, ""I thought you were my friend. Now, I find out my best friend is the enemy"". Tuan shouts, ""WE not enemy, YOU ENEMY.""

There is a touching love than cannot happen, because of cultural differences, between Adrian and Trinh

538598,5,6303027016,"Good Morning Vietnam is a film (and an expression) that has entered our cultural lexicon for many reasons - the music that takes you back to that era, the manner in which it poked fun at the censorship and sometimes ridiculous bureaucracy of the armed services, the history lesson about the futility of the Vietnam War (which the Vietnamese call ""The American War""), the inevitable cultural and social conflict of American G.I.'s befriending young Vietnamese women, and, last but not least, the manic and memorable performance of Robin Williams as AFRS disk jockey Adrian Cronauer. Nearly 30 years later, the film is still number 100 on the list of the ""American Film Institute's 100 Funniest American Movies"".

I re-watched the film recently for 2 reasons: as an homage to the loss of the unique and brilliant work of Robin Williams, and because we had recently returned from a trip to Vietnam. All of our tour guides greeted us each day with a cheerful ""Good Morning Vietnam"". They also love the film :) There was only one area in which I felt the film lacked authenticity - it was actually filmed in Thailand, rather than Vietnam though I've not been able to discover why. Perhaps in 1987, so soon after the end of the war the door was not yet open in Vietnam to such an endeavor. The streets were too clean and tidy, and it looked more like a studio back lot than actual street scenes from Saigon.",1416528000,,1401,4.649193548387097

Jim Carrey could have done the comedy stuff probably just as well, but the serious parts, Robin Williams has a great ability to act using just his facial expressions to convey his emotions.

538857,5,6303027016,"There are a handful of films for which Robin Williams will always be remembered. This is one of them and the one that many identify most with him. He was nominated for the Oscar for it but did not win.

He played Adrian Cronauer, a radio DJ with the USAF who is sent to DJ for the armed services in Saigon, Vietnam. The problem is that some of his higher ups do not want the servicemen to know some of the worse things going on in country. Almost as bad, they have an antiquated idea of what music they listen to with polkas and Lawrence Welk topping their list. Cronauer brings them rock and roll and the stand up comedic sensibilities of Robin Williams plus tells them the truth. The servicemen adore him.

But this is a serious film too. Cronauer makes friends too, some of them good and some of them on the wrong side but he doesn't know it. But, of course, that is Vietnam; knowing the sides was always murky. Bruno Kirby is absolutely hilarious as this uptight lieutenant who thinks he is funny but is actually hideous as a DJ. In his own way he IS funny because he is just too awful for words. J.T. Walsh also plays a really mean superior officer who would just as rather get his DJ killed by the VC rather than listen to him another day.

There are some very good Vietnamese roles too, most of them beginning with Adrian taking over the English class for the Vietnamese, teaching them English Robin Williams style. If I had had him as my foreign language teacher, I could speak anything, I swear! Tung Thanh Tran as his best friend Tuan is excellent. Forest Whitaker in a very early role is an aspiring DJ who wants to be the next Adrian Cronauer.

This is a not to be missed movie. It is Williams at his peak and that was a very rare and fine talent indeed.

538917,3,6303027016,"Throughout his whole career, Robin Williams was known as the guy who could carry a film simply by being a part of it. Good Morning, Vietnam is once again an example of this extreme talent. Not all of Williams' films were great, and as was the case with Dead Poets Society, when you break down Good Morning, Vietnam to the basics, it's simply a story about a raunchy radio DJ pissing off his superiors. The story isn't very deep and there isn't much to go out aside from an out of this world performance by the late Robin Williams. In this film, Williams portrays armed forced radio DJ, Adrian Cronauer, who in 1965, took a job with the Army as a radio host. In the 60s there was no satellite radio or TV at the touch of a button, so stations like this were the mens only connection to home. Most of the time these stations played soothing music and gave the news, but Cronauer gave the men something they desperately needed, some humor in an otherwise terrible situation. He was definitely one of the first shock jocks to ever hit the airwaves and Williams portrayal was absolutely terrific. Much of the radio bits featured in the films were never written in any script, as Williams simply went up to the microphone and did what he does. The rest of the story is unfortunately not as interesting, featuring Cronauer befriending the local populations and falling for a young Vietnamese woman. Good Morning, Vietnam is another one of Williams films that you must see simply because it was one of the best performances ever recorded on film. In all honesty, without Williams, this film would have fallen flat on it's face. This is why, films like this would pay Williams to come in and do his thing, because he took films like this one from ordinary to extraordinary.",1414281600,,1764,4.5678233438485805

539042,2,6303027016,"The problem with watching a film like Good Morning, Vietnam for the first time in the year 2014 is that weve already had decades to witness the magical talent that was the late, great Robin Williams.  So, while this film was ground-breaking for Williams career due to his incredible non-stop ability to ad-lib, watching it now just feels like were watching more of what weve come to expect from Williams extensive catalog and that its nothing new.

That being said, Williams not-as-realistic portrayal of the real-life Adrian Cronauer commands your attention in that way for which Williams always had a knack.  Amongst the impressions he does in the film, you're sure to see some of his regulars, like the slow-drawling hillbilly and the loud Broadway shouts of Ethel Merman.  And, of course, when Williams Cronauer stirs the pot and gets suspended, and Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) thinks he can take his place and do better comedy, well, we all know what a terrible idea that will turn out to be.

The plot of this film is much the same as any other defy authority kind of picture.  They tell Cronauer what he can and cant say on the air, and of course there comes a point where he defies his orders because doing the right thing is more important than following the rules.  And, of course, he is the thorn in his superiors side because he won't blindly follow what they tell him to do just because they're of a higher rank.

The side plot, which eventually becomes much more than just a side plot, involves Cronauer trying to pursue a pretty local named Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), even going so far as to substitute himself in as the teacher of the English class she is taking and becoming good friends with her brother, Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran), to get on her good side.

Tuan even comes to Cronauers rescue multiple times, saving him from everything from being two seconds away from becoming a casualty in a restaurant that is eventually bombed to, once again, potentially becoming a casualty when one of the higher-ups arranges it so that Cronauer and Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) end up on a Viet Cong-controlled roadway in an effort to dispatch of Cronauer once and for all.

Perhaps the most moving moment of the film is when Cronauer performs his radio routine for a convoy of soldiers in the middle of the street just before they go off to fight.  The soldiers reactions look genuine, like they actually cast real soldiers to simply provide their names to Williams and enjoy his ripping on them shortly before they go off to fight in the war.

But its in this moment that Cronauer picks their spirits up, and it serves as a good reminder to him of just how important humor, as well as a purveyor of humor, can be in times of trouble and crisis - much in the same way that his broadcast has become to those who are listening.",1413331200,2,2840,4.601980198019802

Hated to hear of his suicide. I'm wondering if he knew how much his fans loved him.

I know the perils of clinical depression. I've been suffering from it since I was a kid. Even attempted suicide a few times, only to be unable to do it. Some may think suicide due to depression is a cowardly act. I don't think of it like that. I see it as a way to get away from the huge mass of emotions, which are far stronger than people who have never fought them your whole life.

Yes, Robin's death was tragic--and he and his rare wit and humor will definitely be missed.",1412553600,2,685,4.097014925373134

I have watched this highly entertaining movie countless times, since it was first released, and still watch it from time-to-time.

This touching, bittersweet movie will make you laugh, and cry. For my generation as a Babyboomer, the horror nightmares of the Vietnam War, the soldiers that we lost, the families that suffered and the trials and tribulations of that era bring us all back to those uneasy times where we felt as if the whole country has gone mad. Robin Williams played the role of a radio deejay, Adrian Cronauer who delivers a superb performance in acting, as he tells it like it is. His early a.m. radio show is packed with comic during the Saigon adventures, along with the hottest hits from the 60s. The soldiers love him, but the top brass is furious. Adrian aims to please the G.Is, and does so in his own unique, and hilarious ways.

As much as I don't like the harsh or foul language that was used, I thought this movie was perfect in all aspects for the setting and subject matter of the war and the times. I don't think anyone but Robin Williams could have played the part of the disc jockey. I have read that he did much of the movie without a script. He was just given the freedom to do and say the crazy things he did. One thing I know about those days is that there was still a huge gap between the young guys who were drafted into a war that they didn't understand and the top men in the military who were making decisions. Anyway, I thought the movie was fantastic. It also showed that the Viet Nam citizens and the Americans all had heartaches. It was a  horrible time. Williams couldn't have done a better job.",1410825600,4,866,4.094117647058823

Most of the movie is great, I'm not sure how 'accurate' most of it is though, some things seem far-fetched to me but maybe it's not. I don't know much about the Vietnam war, maybe military personnel were allowed to come and go totally as they please and take teaching jobs in other countries... Lol. That doesn't really bother me, but if you're interested in historical accuracy, it might. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that the ending is fairly poor.

539796,5,6303027016,"This is a wonderful movie for multiple reasons.  Robin Williams is brilliant as Adrian Kronauer, a hip DJ trying to do his think in the uptight world of Vietnam in the Johnson era as it escalated and became totally out of control.  Williams on-air improvisations, impressions, and humor totally resonates with the troops, even as it alienates his immediate 2 levels of command above, who prefer Percy Faith and Pat Boone to the Stones, and the Beatles, and who have no sense of humor.  Kronauer is exactly what the troops want, and the commanding general (a facimile of Westmorland?) brought him there there for that reason.

Kronauer falls ""in love"" with a beautiful Vietnamese girl and pursues her, only to find that getting the girl in this society isn't like home.  He is confronted with a courtship ritual that keeps them surrounded by her family, led by her brother, as chaperones. As Kronauer pursues the girl, he also becomes friends with her brother, who subsequently saves Kronauer from being blown up in a bombing of a GI bar.

The plot thickens as Kronauer becomes increasingly disillusioned with the news censorship, and military bureaucracy when he is prevented from announcing the news of the bombing in Saigon that he was nearly in.  The brass try to censor him, suspend him, and then quietly allow him to take a road trip to a military outpost over a road they know has been re-taken by the Viet Cong.

I won't spoil the ending, but the movie brings alive many of the crazy contradictions of the Vietnam war, our relationships with the Vietnamese, and our own internal battles to understand what's going on around us without going crazy.  Williams is at his most brilliant as Adrian Kronauer in a performance that stands the test of time and makes me want to watch him again and again.",1410307200,6,1802,4.75

539851,4,6303027016,"THE FILM: GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM is one of Robin Williams' best movies and was one of the first to really showcase his improvisational abilities. However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's ""What a Wonderful World."" On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction. Just kick back, relax and take in the comic genius that was Robin Williams.

THE DISC: For this 25th Anniversary Edition, Touchstone delivered a nice package. The picture and audio quality is perfect (or at least as perfect as the format allows) and there is a decent amount of special features. The biggest extra is a 34-35 minute series of production diaries which features members of the cast and crew, and Adrian Cronauer, reminiscing on the film. There is also some raw footage of Robin Williams improvising in the DJ scenes that didn't make it into the final cut, and two theatrical trailers.

OVERALL: This is an outstanding film, which works on multiple levels and the Blu-ray presentation is also excellent. This seems to be the definitive release, and I highly recommend buying it.",1410220800,4,2626,4.885650224215246

539855,3,6303027016,"The movie was good, it showed Robin Williams comedic abilities and  abilities as well.  He portrayed a real life radio host who did things his way.  The news he was allowed to report was done in a style hard to explain.  He use improvised sound affects and introduced ""guests"" who's voices he provided. He also insisted on playing Rock and Roll over the polka music and Mantovani music used by the others.  The top brass and jealous broadcasters  with less talent didn't know what to do, but he was very popular with the soldiers in the field or on R&R in town.  Finally sent home due to his  unintentional friendship with a wanted member of a Viet Cong terrorist group, his farewell broadcast was as funny and colorful as ever.  I gave this movie 3 stars because of the rather crude, rude, and four letter word usage.  Yes, people may have spoken that way, and may still do, but I was disappointed that he did so in the film.  While his fans may enjoy this movie, if you are looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, may I suggest, "" Hook"",  ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", or his portrayal of the genie in Disney's animated film, ""Alladin"".",1410134400,,1133,4.446601941747573

539902,5,6303027016,"When Robin Williams was making movies we were rearing a family and just trying to keep up with life. There wasn't much time for going to the movies and since we came of age during Vietnam, nothing about that time seemed funny. So here we are in our sixties and Friday night is pizza and a movie at home in our comfy empty nest. And so we finally watched Robin Williams in Good Morning, Vietnam.

And now we know what everybody else knew well before us, the man was truly a comic genius. Even if you aren't interested in the story line (irreverent funny guy entertains the troops in Nam . . . they love him . . . his uptight superiors loathe him), the stand-up routines are mesmerizing.

This is not a laugh-a-minute comedy. It is an opportunity to experience true comedic genius.

Highly recommend this movie. It is worth the two hours and one minute, which is 31 minutes more than my usual limit. Pour yourself a glass of wine, sit back and remember just how good it is to be alive in America.",1409875200,2,994,4.333333333333333

540091,5,6303027016,"I loved this film when it first came out, and love it more now. Robin Williams is poetry in motion. Not a frame wasted. Wonderful editing. Great 60s music. Memories of what it felt like to be in your 20's and in the middle of a youth quake. Riots, school takeovers, Black Panther brothers, the death of Che, the Venceremous Brigade in Cuba. We thought we'd live forever and never grow old. Watching this slice of Nam and the young American men fighting over there made me weep, making it difficult to see the movie through the fog of tears. So very long ago!

When the movie came out I was eager to see it because I knew J. T. Walsh and was thrilled to see him in a film with Robin Williams, my favorite entertainer. When J. T. and I met in 1983 in NYC, he was a struggling Off-Broadway actor with great talent. He was in an Off-Broadway play with another young unknown named John Goodman. I knew after watching the play they were destined for bigger things. John hit the lottery with Roseanne and J. T. broke the ice with Glengarry Glen Ross on Broadway. In 1983, I could have never forseen J. T. dying at 53 and Robin at 63. When Good Morning, Vietnam came out they were two young, dynamic, talented men with their entire lives ahead of them.  Watching this film now, in 2014, it breaks my heart knowing how their stories end.

The reaction from the audience in the Times Square movie theatre was electric. We had never seen anything like this before. A fresh take on the war in Nam. How could you make light of Vietnam when so many American men and women didn't come home? Or your friends came home but were hooked on drugs and their souls were shattered forever. They left their youth in the rice paddies and on muddy roads.

This is my favorite Robin Williams movie with The Birdcage a close second. There will never be another entertainer like him. He was one-of-a-kind. Unique. Brilliant. Electrifying. He walked that high wire every performance without a net. This film is a living testament to his talent. My grandchildren will watch this many years from now and laugh as hard as I did. My daughter wore his Mork rainbow suspenders for years. I wish I had kept them.

You can almost feel the humidity as you watch the film.  It is very emotional to see the gun boats on the rivers and deltas as James Brown blasts from their portable radios on deck.  As they man the machine guns and wait for the enemy to show himself, these great 60s classics give them a chance to briefly exhale. When the Vietcong heard the music in the distance, what were they thinking? Here come those crazy American kids? Did some of them wish they could be US soldiers and return to America? Escape from the Nam they grew up in. This movie makes your heart break and opens up your imagination to 'what if?'

Because Robin Williams left us only a few weeks ago this film is difficult to watch. However, you are so thankful he made it and you have a chance to revisit his incredible talent. To me, this is a special film because Robin was so new to the big screen and showed a vulnerability he would not in future films. When I first ordered it the day after Robin died, it was sold out on amazon. Not surprised at all. Happily waited for it to be re-issued.

This is how I am spending Labor Day 2014. Remembering Vietnam, J. T., all my friends who fought there, and remembering what it felt like to be in my 20's living overseas and protesting the war.  There will never be another war like Nam. Next time the war will come to us and will be fought on our streets.  Think it can't happen? Read the headlines. There won't be funny scenes and rock n' roll when ISIS arrives.

We will always have Good Morning, Vietnam to remind us of our youth and how we spent it.

Thank you, Robin.  Thank you J. T.  You will always be with us through your incredible bodies of work. So blessed to have witnessed your talent.",1409443200,14,3891,4.354972375690608

No plot? The main character has conflicts with other characters. Those conflicts come to a resolution at the end of the movie. That, in a nutshell, is the definition of plot.

540234,5,6303027016,"I saw this movie when it came out and really liked it.  When this precious man died I thought it would be a good idea to have the movie, so I can play it for my grandchildren.  All ages appreciate the fantastic gifts that Robin Williams shared with all of us.  I am so glad they are available to us.",1408838400,,299,3.95
540235,3,6303027016,"After his tragic death, I went back to the myriad of films Williams left us with to remember him by.  For a man who touched so many with his talent, from that manic comedy of his tours to that straight out honesty on the silver screen, I feel like I'm still mourning a friend.  He's been there since I was born.  I remember him as Mork from re-runs.  I can only imagine what those who really knew and loved him are going through.  Perhaps his adoring public adores him more than they because we never saw his struggles but only his art in its highest form.

But because his performances were so honest I've re-watched the top 5 that come to mind though I was too young to watch this movie when it first came out in theaters.

From that signature yell, ""Good Morning, Vietnam!"" to the complicated politics behind the microphone, this movie is extremely American.  It's neither pro war, nor pro pacifism, it just really depicts the confusion behind the politics of every 20th Century war America has been in, not just the Vietnam campaign.  Censorship is prevalent then and now, where dysinformation, misinformation and downright hiding the ball gets people killed.  Just when we thought ""terrorism"" was a creation of the modern times, we are reminded that the Viet Cong were among the first terrorists to kill Americans and their own with bombings in Saigon.  It's hard not to draw comparisons to modern day Middle-East conflict.

There's also something horribly comedic about a very burly Tweedle-Dee and his near twin Tweedle-Dum sitting in a small room marking up the news that is spit out of telefax paper with giant red markers until the only topic to talk or joke about is the weather.  And even then the hero gets in trouble for it.

There are some really stellar performances from Williams' lesser known Vietnamese co-stars.  Though I'm no terrorist sympathizer but Cronauer's teary-eyed friend has a soliloquy that moves you if you have a heart.  What's sad is you know the hero, Adrian Cronauer, as well as an entire country, is caught in something they have absolutely no control over.  In the end you don't know if any of his friends survived.  It's good for the next generation to understand that modern wars are not the type to give any side a clean ""win.""

Adrian represents the innocent naivete of Americans with good intentions who want to ""help"" other countries build better nations, and the reality of that is historically it never works out the way we want it.  That is why the movie is still relevant today, though many of the jokes went over my head because they are period jokes.

Williams' performance is subdued in this movie, dramatically and comedically, and I'm wondering if it's a result of the director or the environment.  You can't have a fully comical comedian wandering in the army, and you can't have a depressing DJ so I found Cronauer's character neither here nor there.  Even the soldiers' adoration of Cronauer seemed disingenuous and contrived.  I blame editing, script and direction, because I think this could have been a much better movie.

But Williams does the best with what he's got because you believe the struggle this flawed hero is caught in.  He tries to drown his stress in bad beer, love and pho but none of that really works out.  The best dramatic scene is where Cronauer, covered in someone else's blood, is forced to conceal the event on the radio and he snaps.  There is no free thinking in the Army, and it's probably better that way.",1408838400,2,3493,4.691297208538588

540237,5,6303027016,"All I can say about Robin Williams in this film is comic genius. You really have to watch it several times to get all the funny lines. He has such  a ""rapid fire"" delivery. The scenes with the soldiers doing their jobs, in that jungle heat and humidity, made me stop and think about that war, and how horrific it was.  Adrian was just trying to make something good out of a very bad situation.",1408838400,,393,4.226666666666667

Williams' performance is inspired, but the minor characters are also terrific.  The exchanges between Williams and the Vietnamese characters as he comes to realize his own naivete and feels not just the pain of his disappointed hopes, but the pain he as an American has been complicit in causing are really powerful (kudos to Tung Thanh Tran and Chintara Sukapatana).  Williams exchange with the troops, where he comes to realize their desperately terrible situation and how much what he does means to them is an education for all of us from the other side of the war.  From the extreme of comedy to the extreme of tragic suffering, the movie and Williams leave it all on the screen.

GMV stretches Williams as well as the rest of a top-notch cast as they wrestle not only with entertaining, but with the terrible reality of a bloody conflict where lines between right and wrong were frequently blurred. The soundtrack features some of the best music of the era, including Louis Armstrong's ""It's a Wonderful World"". A film worth seeing and then seeing again!

My son reprised the role Williams played when he was a bit younger (6th grade) as he was lucky enough to be involved at a local radio station where I worked at the time. They did a ""April Fool's Day"" gig where they replaced the regular morning DJ's with a younger version of them. My other son got in the act by portraying the ""traffic"" guy as well. My ""DJ"" son was a hit, and he started his morning (6-10am) shift off with ""Goooooood Morning Vietnam!""  And also did a shout out to his school, students and principal!

541062,5,6303027016,"I love this movie and did get to see it when it came to the theater on my Air Force Base in 1988. I love Robin Williams as an actor and have followed his career in several films after this one. This time he plays a DJ that gets assigned to a Saigon Radio station. All is dismal until he comes on the air. Eventually, everyone listening just love him and his comedic antics. The ""authority figures"" in charge, however, have a different take on his on air show. They want it stopped at all costs! Soon though he finds himself entangled in a friendship with a Vietnamese girl and her Vietcong brother, unknown to him at first. In time, he realizes that he cannot stay and says a tearful goodbye to all that have come to love him.

I consider this movie actually a comedy drama, if there is such a thing. It is comedy for much of the first part, yes, but it takes a drama tone, as it should, because he is in Vietnam during a War. (Eventhough War was never declared).
Robin touched many lives and I think this movie will go down as one of his best he ever did. Thank you Robin for making this great movie to enjoy for many years to come! By sending a message that adding a little laughter to your day, even if you are in the middle of a War, makes it a little better. You will be missed sir!!

The movie looks good and sounds good on bluray! The menu is nicely done with a military feel to it and has many features on this 25th Anniversary Edition. Highly recommend !",1407888000,2,1463,4.147887323943662

this is absolute comedic quality!!  the 80s had tons of it!!  and robin Williams sure was a huge part of it, so sad he passed away, but we'll always have his work to remember.  and it doesn't hurt if you were lucky like me to see this when it first came out. ;)  but def. one of his very best :)",1407801600,2,645,4.104

I was fortunate to hear Cronauer's discussion on that point many years ago on NPR.

Otherwise, though, this was one of the very best Vietnam flicks of all time, starring Earth's greatest comedian in a dramatic role that was brilliant and moving beyond description.

With William's passing yesterday, I agree with so many others, One significant point of light was extinguished in our arena. I trust, however, that the light will re-emerge in the next plain, a verdant, green meadow bathed in a rainbow. At last, Robin Williams, at last, will be free of depression and demons creeping in amongst his every moment of silence. And, perhaps, he will be sent back down to the most down-trodden, most depressed, weakest among humanity, with the assignment to cheer them up.

Or, he's gone the other direction and will....

""Awakenings"", ""World According to Garp"", ""Moscow on the Hudson"", even ""Popeye""--- yes, even ""Popeye"", much as he smack-talked it--- all of them are musts, too many to list.  But this is my favorite, not just because it's a great film, but because it was the most perfectly tailor-made to him.  To watch the key scene, when he at first reluctantly then full-throttle gives an impromptu roadside performance to a bunch of green recruits, is to witness one of those rare movie moments when a performer transcends mere performance and very generously lets us see into his soul.  He was insecure, he was needy, he tried-too-hard, he actually cared--- he was the quintessential funnyman of modern cinema.

We'd even lie down on our cots, put the head-phones on, and float downstream with Country Joe and the fish, Blue Cheer, Moby Grape, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Beatles, et al.

541290,1,6303027016,"I laughed a couple times, but that was it. I'm okay with a comedy that is a little sparse on side splitting laughter, if the story line is good. The part of the movie where there is the most ""emotion"" is when Robin Williams witnesses an explosion that kills or wounds several servicemen... he is very troubled by it, and reacts in a way that gets him in trouble with his superiors. Later, he finds a Vietnamese boy he has befriended planted the bomb, and helps him escape capture. So, in conclusion, the comedy was just not very funny aside from a few points, the plot development was mediocre, and the moral of the story seemed to be it's okay to be a terrorist as long as you're a nice guy aside from blowing people up.

Really bad movie. One of the worst I have ever seen. I've never given a one star review on a movie before. I actually stopped half way through and did laundry it was so boring.",1401408000,6,899,4.257309941520468

people (soldiers, colleagues and Vietnamese civilians) that leaves you

541396,4,6303027016,"I think the ideal person to watch this movie would be those of you who enjoy the humor and dramatic acting styles of Robin Williams, and those who have a thing for the Vietnam war era and want to see a film that looks at it from a different angle than just that of ""the actual war."" This provides a refreshing depiction of war, from the perspective of a military member that would typically be overlooked. In fact, so much so that his superiors look down on him and tell him his deployment has granted him a ""comfy job."" That said, the power of the radio and entertainment allows for the men doing the ""hard labor"" and fighting to boost their morale. To feel good or be able to laugh even though they are in a bad situation. The movie does a good job at showcasing this.

The absurd love interest is fairly comical on the surface, but let's the film examine the locals in Vietnam, and thus, granting us another perspective not typically seen in US film. I wouldn't say the movie is perfect by any stretch. It's ending left something to be desired. But, if you're watching for the ride and not necessarily the destination, you may enjoy this thoroughly. Robin Williams is stellar, and if you like his stand up comedy, you will like his improv radio sessions paired with solid acting all around, both the scripted comedic acting and more dramatic acting some may be accustomed to from films like Good Will Hunting.",1394323200,,1412,4.494163424124514

Featuring a behind-the-scenes look at Williams' hilarious radio monologues, GOOD MORNING VIETNAM remains the quintessential Robin Williams comedy.

However, Good Morning, Vietnam, like MASH of the Korean War, looks at the conflict from a different point of view with a great deal of humor.  And still it portrays the types of people the GI/Sailor came in contact with and also had to put up with, while attempting to get his job done.  Of course, Robin Williams is always good, and this movie was made to order for his antics and humor.  The 12 minutes of dialog in his first radio broadcast are Robin at his best.

It's a view into life in the military that is actually pretty right on target with reality.  We were in the military when it was released and although the movie is set in Vietnam time the protocol and daily life of the military person was really the same as it was in the 80's.  It shows how ridiculous some of the policies and practices were, yet also shows that the real military person as an actual person, fighting because it's his/her job, not always liking what that means, putting up with monotony and pure terror sometimes in the same 10 minutes, and finally just in how they relate to the world.  Robin Williams was at the top of his game when this came out and does a fantastic job of showing how important humor is to really tough situations.  Both my teenage boys put down their phones and actually watched the movie because oh his humor rants and skits, and because of the way the movie put the story together.  That says a lot!

Vietnam War Docudrama 1
Good Morning Vietnam

""Good Morning Vietnam!"" was the main motto and the movie title of movie about the Vietnam War. This was a war comedy movie directed by Barry Levinson and the title in the movie talks mostly about the morale of the American troops, the censorship of media and the local life of Vietnam. The story was set in 1965, and it talked about an Airman First Class Adrian Cronauer (played by Robin William) who arrives in Saigon from Crete to work as a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. He first enters the place with curiosity and the place is nothing like America. The beer in local Vietnam is terrible, the streets are different, and the weather was terrible. However Adrian came here to boost the morale of the troops, however the Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson didn't like the way Adrian was broadcasting the information. Adrian's way of broadcasting and his comedy were spectacular and the soldiers really enjoyed it. He had fan letters from everyone and he played loud and active music that boosted the army's morale.

Through out the movie, Adrian also went out to the local life of Vietnam and met some new people. He went to a local English school in Vietnam, went to local bars and he also experienced the local markets and life styles of the Vietnamese. He made friends with the Vietnamese and he interacted with them a lot. One of his closest friends was Tuan, which taught him many of the traditions and introduced Adrian to his sister Trinh. Adrian was interacting with the locals and he started to enjoy the daily life there. His radio broadcasting was also successful, however the sergeant and lieutenant were both constantly telling him to change his content because it wasn't suited for the soldiers. Also, Adrian was also unhappy about the censorship the military is providing. He believes they have the right to know everything, but the military leaders don't allow it. Adrian later was suspended once, but later he was called back. However in the end, Adrian found out about Tuan being a terrorist, who is wanted by the South Vietnamese police, this resulted in losing his job and losing a close friend. He left the final voice message to all the soldiers and enjoyed the company of the Vietnamese on the last day and left Vietnam after five months of working.

This movie really portrayed the life in Vietnam. It wasn't about the war zones, but it was about integrating an American into the Vietnam life. In one part of the movie, it showed how Americans were racist to the Vietnamese that went into the bar. The American soldier started to insult Tuan and had a bar fight with Adrian in the end. In Vietnam life, Adrian also spent time in a Vietnamese cinema, it had English subtitles and this shows how common an American life is. The streets that we see from the movie, there are Americans everywhere. They are smoking, drinking, it's like a common thing and American life is simulated in it. In the movie, one of the main scenes was in an English school. A military soldier was teaching the Vietnamese simple English, just like a first grade class in a normal American school. American influence is strong in the country, and these actions were a sign to pacification. America tries to educate the Vietnamese, let to simulate into their society and show that America is trying to help and save this country. The class has a range from high school students to old people; this shows that America is educating every single person in the country. The people are learning and a lot of them have fun learning this new language. When Adrian came in the class, he taught about simple slang language, or daily American things like baseball to these people. It was a mixed society and there are different perspectives for everyone.

In the story, there are Vietnamese that blame America for the damages that were done in the country. There were terrorist bombings that destroyed the bar where the Americans go. There were protests on the streets and the police had to use violence to stop these actions. The Vietnamese police even had to secretly kill all the traitors as they caused a threat to the society they were in. Tuan in the end was part of these traitors. He explained to Adrian in the end, ""Enemy? What is an enemy? You killing my own people so many miles from your home. We're not the enemy. You're the enemy. Big deal! My mother's dead. And my older brother, he's dead. Shot by Americans. My neighbor, dead. His wife, dead. Why? Because we're not human to them. We're only little Vietnamese."" This was very strong and we could see the hatred among some of the Vietnamese in the south. There is hatred towards America and to them, America isn't doing them a favor.

The last thing the movie strongly portrayed was the influence of media and the morale the soldiers needed. During the Vietnam War, many of the soldiers missed their family, loss their friends and suffered in many other hardships. Adrian was the DJ that was sent here to boost the morale of these troops. When Adrian met the soldiers on the field personally, he knew how influential he was. His jokes provided happiness and provided another purpose towards life and war. It helped to fight better and reminded them of their American spirit. However, in the movie we can see how the army tries to hide the true news from the soldiers out in the field. There was news like, ""US military leaders in Saigon urge secretary of Defense, Mcnamara to approve a force level of 350,000 to 400,000 US soldiers."" These things were censored and a lot of things were not correctly reported. Like the bar explosion was also not mentioned in the broadcast because the generals don't want the soldiers to know about the tragic news that was brought upon them. However, this angered Adrian and he didn't get to truly give out the meaning of the broadcast. However in the end, he ended in good note, he got to know the people and had a relationship with Vietnam. Overall, this was a good comedy movie that gave an insight into Vietnam and it showed things other than war zones in Vietnam.",1364256000,,6165,4.667893284268629

We hadn't see this movie in forever and the kids had never seen it.

It also has a few drama parts but overall a comedy start to finish.  What made me mainly buy the dvd was for the many one liners Williams does on the morning show he does for Vietnam.  As a side bar one of my favorite things Robin Williams does he his talent for doing mutiple voices and change his voice to do it.  So if your fan of the actor or looking for a good comedy movie to sit back and watch on a night have nothing else to do then pick this movie up and sit back and savor laugh after laugh.,1338940800,,800,3.9074074074074074

To be fair the film does not claim to be a factual biography and does tell a good story about different cultures and war. However, I think the crowning achievement of the film comes toward the end when Williams queues up Louis Armstong's ""What A Wonderful World"" and we listen to Satchmo sing while we witness a montage of war scenes. It is perhaps some of the most powerful moments of film Hollywood has ever produced and the film is worth owning for that footage alone.",1338163200,,593,4.5
542104,4,6303027016,"Everybody knows I love Robin Williams. But I have avoided this movie for a long time, since I have such mixed emotions and memories of the Vietnam War era. Still, the premise of this movie finally got to me: a disc jockey on the service radio station with all the ad-lib skill and insane humor of Robin Williams. After all, those guys needed things to laugh about, you betcha.

Adrian Cronhauer (Williams) arrives to find the station is a decidedly mixed bag. Some are total sourpusses, some are just no-talent (the guy who thinks he should play polkas and tells the most stupid jokes you have ever heard), and some are cool but essentially powerless. That is, if you go by the rules. Cronhauer is not really into rules. He knows he's in a war zone, although he is told Saigon itself is pretty safe. And he accepts the twin censors (yes, literally twins) who cut out most of the news before he can broadcast it. But he plays rock and roll, he jives with the audience, makes up incredible ""interviews"" with people he imitates (including Nixon, among others), and becomes extremely popular with the soldiers. Not so the officers, except the one commander who understands that morale is a major issue with the troops, and is the one who discovered Cronauer on Greek radio and brought him to Vietnam.

He's starstruck over a beautiful girl who passes by on the street, tracks her to an English class being taught by a soldier, and bribes the teacher to let him teach for awhile. But the girl is there with her brother, who is very protective. Keep your eye on that brother.

Without giving away any plot lines, one thing I can recommend is you pay close attention in that English class, where Cronauer is really Robin Williams, teaching the class how to talk street-wise American English. Very, very funny stuff.

There's both humor and tragedy, and some very thoughtful aspects to both, as in most Robin Williams films. Why not five stars? Because the military parts are pretty one-dimensional, the good guys really good, the bad guys really awful. The good guys smart; the bad guys stupid. And I figure you've seen one Vietnam war movie, you don't need more of bombs and bloody corpses. Still, I will grant they are relevant to the story, and not too over-done. Or at least the bombing of the bar where the Americans hang out is relevant to the story.",1336867200,,2349,4.625899280575539

542107,3,6303027016,"It's been 25 years since Robin Williams starred in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM just being released on blu-ray. The movie was based on the life of Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force officer who changed the way the military ran radio during the Vietnam War. At least that's what I think most of us thought the movie was about. But it turns out to be more about a comedian run wild in a starring role than about what happened in Vietnam.

Williams stars as Cronauer, in this case an officer hand picked by Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) to bring his humor to the approved radio station the military runs for the troops. To date that station has had flat sounding DJs who play nothing more exciting than a polka. Cronauer changes that by playing rock and roll, the music that most of the soldier in the field listened to before they were brought to this country.

This runs counter to the man in charge, Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T.Walsh) and his right hand man Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). They see no problems with the way things have been and so take offense to the new guy. But with the General backing him, Cronauer's personality runs wild on the air and he breathes fresh air into the style and content of the show he does. It also infects the other on air talent and makes them step up their game as well.

As he gets used to his new situation Cronauer is aided by Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Garlick advises him of the way things are run, how to get around things on occasion and introduces him to the locals, the females of which are of particular interest to Cronauer. One in particular strikes his fancy and in an attempt to woo her, he takes over a class being taught to the locals on how to speak English. This leads to his meeting the young woman's brother and her family.

The back and forth between enlisted talent and military officials continues. Cronauer has little or no idea of what is actually happening or how popular he's become. But he gets a wake up call when the local bar is bombed by members of the Vietcong. He sees the devastation and realizes that there is a war going on. This change in observation affects Cronauer in such a way that he reads a news brief uncensored for once on the air causing another major rift with the powers that be.

The movie presented to us shows a man who took matters into his own hands and stood for what he believed. It also shows a spastic comedic presence on the air that eventually saw the good he was doing. But the fact is that when you take the time to watch the extras included on this disc you realize the whole character of Adrian Cronauer is less Adrian and more Robin Williams and that's always been one of my biggest problems when watching Williams act.

Catch phrases and bits and pieces of his stand up routines always find a way into the roles he plays unless he has a director that takes hold of him and actually directs his talent which he has in abundance. But left unchecked and unharnessed Williams spastic interpretations of characters seem less like a person being portrayed and more like, well Williams performing as a comedian. Suddenly the story of Adrian Cronauer (though one would assume he was well paid for his story) is less what this is about and more about Williams being himself.

In those extras director Barry Levinson says that the amount of time showing Williams on air antics amounts to less than 14 minutes. But those 14 minutes are the most alive in the film and were used in the advertising campaigns when the film came out to the point where that's the parts you remember. But there are many other times in the film that it feels more Robin and less Adrian.

This was the first time I'd watched this film since seeing it 25 years ago. While it is still an enjoyable film it continues to grate on me that it seems more stand up than biopic. Williams has the ability to be a dynamic actor. To this day I felt that he deserved an Oscar for his performance in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. But when he's turned lose and allowed to use his stand up in a role that doesn't need it, it distracts rather than enhances. The movie is worth watching to see a developing talent and an interesting story but I for one would have liked to see something more about the real Adrian Cronauer and less about Robin Williams.",1332201600,5,4292,4.424050632911392

542109,5,6303027016,"'Good Morning Vietnam' withstands the test of time and has emerged as a classic of the era.

While Robin Williams doesn't really 'do' Adrian Cronauer- who was FAR more conservative in his politics- he channels a nice compromise that suited Hollywood's progressive distaste for the conflict. That dichotomy gives the film it's only weakness. But it is piddling criticism now, given the times.

What is does have is sweep, and scope. Director Barry Levinson ('Rain Man') was at the top of his game, and it has the FEEL of Vietnam. Those who were there will tell you that.

Not to mention a SUPERB cast with JT Walsh, Bruno Kirby, Noble Willingham and Forrest Whitaker. They get ALL of the Army life right. His scene- where he encounters the truckloads of GI's fresh from Boot camp and on their way to combat- is not only hilarious but will bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened combat veteran.

A real treat. The Blu Ray looks and sounds great. Totally worth owning...

542110,4,6303027016,"Robin Williams won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Adrian Cronauer, a real life airman who spent a brief tour in Saigon as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Network.  Hoping to boost morale for an ever escalating war, military brass brought in Cronauer in 1965 to do 2 radio shows daily.  Known for his wit and innovative style, Cronauer was also a bit unusual and irreverent  as depicted in the film.

Williams shows both sides of his acting ability.  He is at the top of his game when he is on the air or in front of the men.  His fast paced monologues are filled with bawdy humor, insults and celebrity mimicking followed by rock and roll music.  This upsets his superiors, specifically Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh) who want a monotone delivery of censored world news followed by music by the likes of Lawrence Welk or Percy Faith, the princes of elevator music.

Cronauer is eventually suspended when he reads an unauthorized news bulletin involving a terrorist attack on a bar where he was moments before and that American servicemen frequented.  Williams shows his dramatic skills as well when he pursues a young Vietnamese woman who resists his charms.  He becomes friends with her brother when he volunteers to teach an English class to the locals.  Instead of ""see Jane run"" style of learning Cronauer teaches them American slang and expletives.  It's hilarious and nearly as funny as when he's ranting on the air.  When Cronauer opens his show with a loud drawn out, gooood morning, vietnaaaam we know it's time to buckle up and enjoy the show.  This is Robin Williams at his best.

Neither the 1.85:1 Blu ray picture or the DTS HD Master Audio sound will likely put this movie on anyones demo list, but there is nothing objectionable either.  The video is clear and crisp.  The audio is limited by the audio designs of the era, so don't expect much wow from the surrounds or sub.

542111,5,6303027016,"It has been some time since I watched 1987's Good Morning, Vietnam, so while a lot of it was so memorable I recognized it immediately, some things were a bit of a revelation, especially as a metaphor for today's American military presence in the Middle East.

Sure, you can make the obvious case for this to be a Hollywood anti-war movie, pure and simple, and it is at first glance. Surely making its points with individuals rather than troops is a powerful way to illustrate the effect of war on people rather than faceless masses. But Good Morning Vietnam is also a story about a relentless clash between front line creative powderkegs and front office administrators. It's also about how creative work reaches out to a lot of people that you may never meet, but to whom your work makes a difference, however big or small.

More than anything, the movie is a perfect vehicle for Robin Williams, whose now-iconic stream-of-consciousness comedy is given full throttle as he goes on the air in a highly fictionalized portrayal of radio personality Adrian Cronauer. Taken out of the context of the late 20th century, when Williams was still breaking into movies and out of his ""Mork"" image, this performance takes on a greater depth than ever. He may appear to basically be playing himself, or at least his persona, but there's a whole lot more to it than just riffing when the cameras roll. As a matter of fact, if you watch the ""monologues"" presented in the bonus features (which are the same on this new Blu-ray as they were on the 2006 DVD edition, alas, with no commentary), you can see that he honed those routines over and over until they were as perfect as possible.

It's no secret that this film does not tell the true story of Cronauer beyond his position of disc jockey in Vietnam and part time English teacher. What's also clear, especially watching it today, is that it also presents a view of 1965 through the prism of 1987 tastes and sensabilities.

When William's character and an audience of Vitemanese viilagers sits in a dumpy, fan-cooled movie theatet to watch Beach Blanket Bingo, the complete irony is crystal clear as Frankie and Annette cavort in what is perhaps the penultimate beach movie. The movie seems out of place in that theater, but also in the pop culture context of 1987 and today. Actually, Beach Blanket Bingo was a new movie in 1965 and such goofy but popular films were huge hits, not the anamoly that it seems as presented in this context.

Musically, it's the same way. The Beatles were a sensation, but they had only just become such over one year. Mainstream popular radio was playing Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin as well as The Supremes and the Beach Boys. In the accompanying documentary featurette, it is pointed out the Louis Armstrong's classic, ""Wonderful World"" (which became even more of a legendary song since the film's debut) was released after Good Morning Vietnam took place, but of course it served the story so well, it doesn't matter.

And I'm not nit-picking for anachronisms. My point is that, in 1987 as in today, some are not aware that AM radio was so diverse. The film is peppered with putdowns of Percy Faith and Mantovani, but I'll bet the real Cronauer played Faith's ""Theme from A Summer Place."" The sensabilities and realities of what made popular music of the mid-sixties was filtered through what became ""classic rock"" programming by the late eighties -- and what would sell on a soundtrack album.

Robin Williams is superb and is given fantastic support by a truly great team of actors, particularly Forrest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl.

542198,5,6303027016,"Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams playing the character of a radio announcer/comedian who makes the trip to Vietnam and gives the soldiers the morning news by way of humor, honesty and quick-witted cleverness.

However, the entire movie is not *quite* a comedy film.  Every so often, you will be probably be surprised by a few really accurate portrayals showing what it really was like living in Vietnam during the war involving the way the Vietnamese were living.

However the storyline mostly centers around Robin Williams' character getting to know the Vietnamese and communicating with them by walking around town and meeting them.  He even becomes a temporary teacher at one point, teaching the Vietnamese the English language and entertaining them in a goofy manner.

Robin immediately takes an interest in this one Vietnamese woman who initially doesn't give a darn about him at all, but eventually things change later on.

Another storyline element involves the brother of the girl he has an interest in.  He plays a crucial (and surprising) part in the storyline later on and gives one heck of a great speech at the end of the film.

I'm really shocked at a few of those accurate surprises I mention above.  One scene in particular shows an explosion that totally caught me by surprise because of the timing, and other scenes show Vietnamese teens being forced to stand up against a wall and immediately be shot.  These are really shocking scenes to me.

Luckily the really violent and brutally honest portrayal of Vietnam back in the early 70's only takes up a very small portion of the actual storyline.  The movie mostly focuses on Robin Williams' role as the comedian.

Now those of you who've seen Robin Williams stand-up comedy routine, don't worry- he's not nearly as crude in this film as he is during those comedy acts on stage.  I'd say 80% of the jokes in Good Morning, Vietnam are clean and completely appropriate for the entire viewing audience.  That *other* 20% isn't really that bad either.  To sum it up- the film mostly shows Robin Williams just being his typically goofy self.

A movie I highly recommend for the drama and comedy elements, however if you dislike Robin Williams style of humor, it's probably best to steer clear of this one.",1290988800,,2277,4.857512953367876

""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a wonderful movie. From start to finish, you never doubt that it is set in 1965 Saigon, with the Vietnam War not yet at the pitch it reached with the 1968 Tet Offensive, but definitely heading in that direction. The unconventional, hopelessly unmilitary Airman Adrian Cronauer, fresh out of Crete ""With women that look like Zorba"", gets off an airliner and is greeted by the seemingly perpetually-happy PFC Eddie Garlick, who never stops calling Cronaeur ""Sir"" even though the Air Force radio DJ has no rank whatsoever. Assigned to AFRS- Armed Forces Radio Saigon- Cronauer rides in a M151 MUTT through Saigon's crowded streets. The ride is entertaining even before it begins: PFC Garlick forgets the MUTT is already running and tries to start it, causing it to emit a noise everyone, car fan or not, will surely dread. Airman Cronauer meets one of his soon-to-be-coworkers at AFRS over the radio before he meets him in person. Dan ""The Man"" Levitan, a friendly but appallingly bland radio jockey, rambles on as Garlick drives. A dismayed Cronauer remarks, ""That guy's as boring as whale ****."" It is an act of true kindness on Cronauer's part that he never tells Levitan this in person. We soon meet the rest of the AFRS staff, some of whom are enthusiastic, others indifferent, and still others hostile to Airman Cronauer's arrival. Chief among the last bunch is Sergeant Major ""Where is this man's paperwork?"" Dickerson, who was allegedly shot in the *** while on a combat patrol. Dickerson hates Cronauer with increasing passion and outright glee as the film goes on, despising his politics and finding nothing funny about anything he says. The station censors, two unnnamed twin sergeants played by Don R. and Don E. Stanton, are the indifferent crowd. All each of them says in greeting to Cronauer is a nod, a blank look, and eventually, ""Hiya."" I found one of Cronauer's remarks about their jobs quite funny- ""Oh, yes! Censor, censor, censor! Join the Army and mark things!"" Soon, we find Cronauer going on air for the first time. There is a moment of uncertain silence. We in the audience are uncertain, the listeners, the staff, even Cronauer himself seem unsure of what will happen next. Then he cuts loose with a joyous cry of ""Gooooooood morning, Vietnam!"" and nothing is ever the same again.

Airman Cronauer is hated by the bureaucrats and loved by the soldiers for the same reason- his manner is totally unconventional, entirely unpredictable, and he starts a wonderful tradition of busting the bureaucracy's rules by tossing the bland music selections aside and blasting across the airwaves with modern rock and roll. The first song he hits us with is the magnificent ""Nowhere To Run"" by Martha Reeves & The Vandellas. Yes! Going off the air, Cronauer spots one of the pretty Vietnamese girls he saw on his ride to the station earlier. He buys a bike with metal wheels and chases her across Saigon, leaving the hapless and distressed PFC Garlick to attempt to keep up. Seeing her go into an English class, Cronauer wonders what he can do to meet her. Garlick insists there is nothing that will work, that the cultural differences between Americans and Vietnamese are simply too much. But being the happy-go-lucky soul he is, Cronauer goes for it anyway. But what does he do? He walks into the class and buys it from the Army sergeant already teaching. His equally unconventional and hilarious way of teaching the class provides some of the greatest scenes in the movie. His first conversation with the class is this- ""First thing I'd like to know is, what subject this is."" A kindly middle-aged Vietnamese woman puts her hand up. ""Is it English?"" ""Yes it is, thank you so much for playing!"" It is after the class that we are introduced to Trinh and her brother, Tuan. The relationship he attempts to create with Trinh, and the friendship he does create with Tuan, are immensely influential in deciding the outcome of his tour in Saigon.
This movie is hilarious- just about knocked me dead when I first saw it. But there is far more depth to it than if it were simply a comedy. It has very sad and thought-provoking moments as well as happy ones, and does not shy away from the senseless horrors of war. More and more, it appears that Vietnam is a world gone mad, and that the insane folks are the ones who make the rules.

The degree to which SGM Dickerson loathes Airman Cronauer becomes apparent later on, when he has Cronauer kicked off the air after he violates regulations and reports on a bombing at Jimmy Wah's bar. Cronauer yells that Dickerson just wants everyone to think everything is fine in Vietnam when the opposite is true, and that the war is a couple of blocks away at most. Dickerson bellows that it is none of his blankety-blank business and replaces him with the horribly bland LT Steven Hauk. Cronauer is soon back on the air, to the tune of thousands of letters and calls from furious and bewildered GI's, who cannot stand to hear Hauk's awful comedy routine and the polka music he insists on choosing over rock and roll. The scene in which Hauk is fired as a radio DJ is one of the most significant in the movie, and has a surprisingly touching line from Hauk. Deeply hurt by Brigadier General Taylor's declaration that Cronauer is better at comedy than he is and *will* be reinstated, LT Hauk salutes and says, ""Sir, in my heart I know I'm funny."" Dickerson, still carrying on his vendetta against Cronauer, vows ""This is not over yet."" as he leaves. Dickerson sends Cronauer and Garlick into an area he knows is VC-controlled, hoping to get them killed, and only the intervention of Tuan prevents this. But even then it's not over- upon his return to AFRS studios, Cronauer meets with a gloating, triumphant SGM Dickerson, who gleefully informs Cronauer that he is gone. The reason? Tuan is not who he claims. He is a VC terrorist, responsible for many bombings in Saigon, including Jimmy Wah's. He was able to rescue Cronauer and Garlick because the guys hunting them were his friends. Dickerson has Cronauer beaten at last, but even then the Airman has the last laugh- he delivers one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in farewell to the good Sergeant Major, and as Dickerson pursues he is stopped by General Taylor. Why? Taylor, who has always loved Cronauer and is deeply sorry to see him leave, though mercifully with an honorable discharge, has at last had enough of Dickerson's unrelenting seriousness and hostility, and informs him that he, too is gone- SGM Dickerson, who had once boasted of his talent at sending people he hates to places they never even knew the Army had personnel in, is going to Guam.

Cronauer's confrontation with 'Tuan', his final softball game with his English class, and the goodbye he and Trinh give one another are beautiful. He leaves PFC Garlick, who has taken over his post as radio DJ, with one last broadcast, and tells him to take care of himself. Garlick readily acknowledges that playing the broadcast could get him in trouble. Having learned from Cronauer and become increasingly bold and outgoing through the course of the film, he says that Trouble is now his new middle name.

""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is everything it promises and so much more- it makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you think about many things, and in the end, if you appreciate the movie as I did, you will walk away loving it. This is as good a film on the Vietnam War as any, and one I highly recommend.

542268,4,6303027016,"When `Good Morning Vietnam' allows itself to be nothing more than entertainment it passes with flying colors.  It's the type of movie that really doesn't need too much of a plot.  When the film tries to add some substance to its running time is when it starts to fray at the edges.

`Good Morning Vietnam' tells the somewhat true story (as in the film is not entirely faithful to actual events) of Adrian Cronauer, a radio DJ who spiced things up during the Vietnam War.  During his stationing in Vietnam he raised the morale of the troupes but also managed to press the buttons of some of the higher officials who saw his approach to broadcast as a slap in the face so-to-speak.  Their resistance didn't stop Cronauer from expressing his viewpoints and bucking the system, reading news he felt the troupes needed to hear, telling jokes he felt would raise their spirits and playing music he knew they would enjoy.

When the film is focused on that aspect of Cronauer's stay it soars.  Robin Williams is hilarious, we all know this, and the film really allows him to just perform his standup routine to us all to enjoy; and enjoy we do.  Williams also manages to delve into the moments that startle and unravel Adrian, piecing together a complete man and not just a walking punch-line.

But then, sadly, the film tries to add weight, and that weight comes in the form of Tuan, a young Vietnamese boy who befriends Adrian.  For the majority of the film he seems harmless enough; just an acquaintance to add some humanity to Williams' character, but in the third act new revelations are revealed and his character changes, and this spurs the film in an entirely different direction that, in my humble opinion, takes away from the films enjoyment.

It feels forced and unnecessary.

Until that moment though, the film is wonderful.  It is funny and moving and meaningful.  The performances for the most part are also splendid.  Williams received a much deserved Oscar nomination for his performance, and of the nominated five I have a feeling I would have leaned towards Williams for the win as well.  Tung Thanh Tran is also effective as Tuan, even if his characters development is ridiculous in my opinion.  Forest Whitaker is somewhat annoying here, but it was early in his career so I'll give him some slack (is it just me or does he sound like David Chappelle's imitation of a white man?).  The real standout here is Bruno Kirby who just nails Lt. Steven Hauk's wit and humor (or un-wit and un-humor) brilliantly and provides some of the films biggest laughs.

In the end I must say that I enjoyed `Good Morning Vietnam' and would love to say that it was one of the best films of 1987.  If the ending had been ditched for one more appropriate then I would say that, but that pesky final act just throws the whole thing for me.  I recommend this film, because it has a lot going for it; it just pains me to say that it could have been even better.",1221436800,2,2948,4.566539923954372

542299,5,6303027016,"Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams in the type of role he plays best, as the hilarious, irreverent, and nonconformist military disc jockey Adrian Cronauer. Based (extremely) loosely on a true story, the movie takes place in 1965, where Cronauer injects life and humor into the hellish existence of GIs fighting the Vietnam War. To the enjoyment of the troops and the fury of his superiors, he fills the airwaves with rapid-fire hilarity, mocks Nixon, plays rock music, and defies the overzealous military censors with ""unofficial"" news reports. Williams' performance is brilliant, and as he would later demonstrate again with films like Dead Poets Society and Patch Adams, the role suits him perfectly.

The movie is so effective because it combines humor with poignancy as Cronauer's spirited humanity clashes with the regimented military life, the horrors of war, and the dehumanizing effects of conflict. He forges relationships with the Vietnamese people he comes into contact with, but heartbreakingly comes up against the barriers of cultural differences and political divides.

In one of the most unforgettable scenes, he dedicates Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" to one of the young GIs headed off to the nightmare of battle. With painful irony, the song mingles with images of the brutal reality of the war. In a sense, the scene encapsulates the discord between Cronauer's insistence on maintaining his humanity and the inhuman world that surrounds him.",1204416000,,1482,5.329059829059829

542348,5,6303027016,"An excellent film, Good Morning Vietnam, brings to the screen the story of a US airman that gets transferred from Crete in Greece to Saigon in South Vietnam as the war in S.E. Asia is escalating.

It is 1965 and the USA is sending more and more troops to S. Vietnam in an effort to live up to its commitments and treaty obligations (SEATO), and turn the tide against communism.  The US Army, worried about the G.I.s' morale, flies in Airman Cronauer from Europe to be a radio deejay and entertain the troops.  Things get a bit more complicated when he begins going around the censors by playing Rock and Roll and giving the news as it is...

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.

Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  The film does a great job of describing war-ravaged Vietnam as well as people's (including soldiers') every day lives and the problems they face under such conditions.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the MUSIC are all wonderful!

In short, Good Morning Vietnam is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

542349,5,6303027016,"Many have tried to dismiss this film as nothing more than a comedic vehicle for Robin Williams. The concept of making light of the horrors of war, particularily Vietnam since it's still so recent in the minds of many turns alot of viewers off to the important potential lessons to be learned in this wonderfully insightful movie.

Based on the true life accounts of Air Force officer and D.J. Adrian Cronauer we get a birds' eye view into the strict and ridiculous bureaucracy that can at times reign over military policy and in effect hamper the morale and efforts of the American military.

Cronauer provided a much needed spontaneity to the air waves of Vietnam radio and brought however briefly to the American soldiers the contemporary music they wanted to hear. There is alot to laugh at in this film, what else could you expect with the likes of Robin Williams in the lead role. However there is much more going on than what first meets the eye. The concepts of acceptance, friendship, trust and love soon become entangled into the comedic elements which lead to the sad and poignant realization that cultural differences can't always be overcome by good intentions. A bittersweet truth so poignantly conveyed by the beautiful Trinh when rebuffing the romantic advances of Cronauer with the statement, ""Vietnam ladies not friends.""

This film will definitely make you laugh. It will also make you cry and even more importantly make you think. In the final analysis that's what it's all about. There are many wonderful performances in this movie complimenting Robin Williams amazing tour-de-force. My two favorites are Tung Than Tran as 'Phan' and Chintara Sukapatana as 'Trinh.'

Highly Recommended!!",1139184000,93,1707,5.021201413427562
542350,5,6303027016,"Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon.

Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other.

Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour (""What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.""). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different.

Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh.

Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities.

This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part ""Production Diary"" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found.

""Raw Monologues"" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations.

Adrian is a respected member of the Vietnam Vet community and a number of Vet friends have mentioned his take on the movie - 'If I'd done half of that stuff, Id have ended up in Leavenworth'.

The movie is both a Robin Williams vehicle and a look at the first major build-up in the War itself. As for it being a 'police action', the irony was not lost on entertainers like Bob Hope, who often greeted his Nam audiences with ""Hello Advisors!"" even when there were more than 500,000 troops in Vietnam.

542355,5,6303027016,"""Hello Vietnam,and greetings!"",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. ""You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff"",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. ""Would Bob Dylan be out of line?"",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,""Way,way,way out of line!"". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,""Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,""You suck,eat a bag of s--t!"". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,""Good morning,Vietnam"",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,""Goodbye,Vietnam"" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV?

542356,2,6303027016,"Overrated! The first two-thirds of GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is pretty good.  This is when the film is a comedy and Robin Williams as AFR's Saigon radio disc jockey Adrian Cronauer is doing his shtick and everyone is happy and laughing.  However, it goes into dark territory as the Williams' character experiences the horrors of war  and his time on-air becomes a little more serious than comedic. Also, Cronauer/Williams becomes involved with some of the local Vietnamese to give him a little dramatic licence. This slows down the story and almost wipes clean the comedy aspect of the film. All of a sudden, his superior who has it in for Cronauer and his radio show antics in the first place, Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) takes over the radio duties. Hauk's humor has more bombs than all that was dropped during the war. If the characters in the film are put off by Hauk/Kirby taking over the mic, it is more excrutiating for the film audience. Overall, a film which misses the target at the last third of the film because what starts out as a comedic vehicle for Williams becomes an apology-card for the Vietnam War.",1101686400,3,1115,4.678571428571429

This movie came out at a time when most vietnam movies were gut wretching excursions into hell.  You can't get the same feel now, since better vietnam war movies have been made, the feelings towards that war have evolved.  But when this movie first appeared, as Cronauer started going off where he shouldn't go, there was always present a certain feeling of dread for his safety.  That tension balanced with the tremendous comedy created a unique experience.  The only comparison I can make is when in a MASH tv episode, Hawkeye goes off and gets stranded.  You know that the writers will never kill off Hawkeye and Alan Alda, their star.  You can't have the same tension between comedy and dread as was created in GMV.  The writers could kill off Cronauer.  We knew it.

However, the fault of this movie is where it tries to be serious. Williams's politics are thinly veiled, as the only people who oppose anything he does (VC's, bully GI's, ""the brass"") are stereotypes. Nothing Haup or Dickerson say or do is ever pleasant or reflective of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. In addition, after picking oneself up from the floor from laughing at Williams's brilliant jokes, one can step back and understand (empathize?) why people might not have liked such comments as ""If it's being done well, here or abroad, it's probably *not* being done by the U.S. Army!"" Now, maybe that's true, maybe it's not, but a lot of people work (and worked) very hard to be sure that what the U.S. Army did is/was done well, and these people wouldn't be the jerks that Dickerson and Haup (sp?) are in this film if they took offense to a deejay like Williams's portrayal of Cronauer.
In short, watch this movie and enjoy the humor, but think twice before taking any sort of ""deeper meaning"" more seriously.",1028592000,4,1212,4.776190476190476
542460,4,6303027016,"Like his roles in ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Patch Adams,"" Robin Williams plays the role of a man trying persistenly to enlighten and help others in spite of a stubborn and wrong status quo and authority figures.  He is undoubtedly funnier here than in either of those two movies.
Adrian Croener's lively, upbeat, and hilarious radio show contrasts with the monotone, boring, and mundane show of the other DJ.  Right from the start, his superiors at the radio station treat him like dirt for no good reason at all.  One of them replaces him on the radio for a short time and while he thought he was funny, the only funny thing about his show was that he thought he was funny.  Among the humor on his show are things like voice impersonations, saying Nixon sounds like Mr. Ed the horse, creating guest voices in the studio, and my favorite- playing a tape he was forced to play of a conversation with Nixon.  He played it allright, but he interrupted segments of it with questions directed at Nixon, followed by his taped response to another question.  For example, one of the parts went somethign like this: Nixon was saying, ""I'm very unsatisfied with it, there's a lack of feeling there,"" and before it he interrupted the tape and asked, ""How is your sex life?""
In the studio, Adrian sees the news coming in and that it must be ""approved"" before it is read on the air to the soldiers in Vietnam.  The things that are struck out are bits of news that point to a long, hard, and losing war ahead.  He wants the soldiers to be aware of these things, reasoning that freedom of speech is what America is all about.  He finally has ""had it"" with the resistance when a restaurant is blown up which he was in just a minute before.  So he gives up on the radio, but the masses make plain his extraordinary popularity and he gets back on.
In the ending, Adrian is forced to relocate because he was friends with a boy who turned out to be the enemy.  This highlights a point he made earlier-- how do you know where or who the enemy is?  Angry, he chased down the boy and asked him what the hell.  The boy explained that it is not the communists but the Americans who are the enemy of Vietnam.  He tearfully yells about his family members who have been killed by American troops.  This incident highlights the point of the movie that American involvement in Vietnam was wrong.
The conclusion of the movie is that although Adrian was stuck in a troubled, bad situation, he made the most of it, managing to do good and remain uncorrupted.",1025913600,3,2526,4.449023861171367
542461,4,6303027016,"Starring Robin Williams as Airman 1st Class Adrian Cronauer, this 1987 film is loosely based on a real radio DJ whose outrageous sense of comedy bucked authority and won the hearts of the American soldiers in 1965 Vietnam.  The audience never learns much about Cronauer's character as there is virtually no back story.  He is just set down in Vietnam at a time in history when the American police action is about to escalate. When he gets to know the Vietnamese villagers, however, his character slowly changes.  Of course there is conflict with his very uptight superiors which adds to the comedy.  Eventually though, the story becomes more complex than the comedy and, at film's end, Cronauer has become more mature and wiser.
I found myself giggling at the jokes, but eventually the comedy all had a certain sameness.  However, I did get into the story.  There wasn't much military action, only some strong hints of what was to come.  Wisely, the film focused on the characters and portrays the Vietnamese villagers as real people who Cronauer teaches to curse in American slang and with whom he plays baseball, using mangos as the ball.  This is a good video, lighthearted and yet with a message.  Robin Williams' performance is excellent.

He does the black voice, the gay voice, the cracker voice...you know the routine.  And it's as rapid-fire as his own performances, so even if one gag's a dud, you're laughing hysterically 15 seconds later.
The plot itself is creaky, and as sentimental,in it's wiseacre way, as some of his more recent schlocky efforts.  Beneath the mania of a Robin Williams (or a Jim Carrey, as we've seen of late) beats a heart of pure mush.  Luckily, in this film, the mania predominates.",1013731200,6,797,4.387755102040816

542464,5,6303027016,"Robin Williams is a comic genius. When he made this film, he was just beginning to show that he can do dramatic acting as well. He mixed both varieties well in this film.
As the film progresses, you begin to identify with the characters. And, amazingly, the Vietnamese are not the antagonists....  The bad guys are the officer and sargeant major that are his immediate superiors.
There are plenty of really funny scenes. There are also plenty of dramatic and action scenes. After watching this film, I wanted to find out more about Pat Sajack.
Definitly a good film.",1006214400,,566,4.717171717171717
542465,1,6303027016,"My 1* rating is for the DVD, not the movie which is 5*.
Most poeople will have seen this film on video and tv and enjoyed it, some of you old folks may have even seen it at the cinema. I think that this is a great film and it belongs in my favourite collection.
A lot of reviews here talk about the film so I wont. I just bought the DVD and watched it, although I have the video as well.
The picture quality was bad, fuzzy and grainy in many places, and I mean the picture, not the mpeg compression.
It was possible in quite a few places to see the mpeg rings. The sound was average, not brilliant but not poor.
There are no real extra features to talk about.
So given that this movie has a great following in many countries I would have expected the DVD conversion crew to have done a much better job.
With no extras and not been a really long film there is no reason to allow compression rings to be visible, where they are visible the conversion people just have to lower the compression rate for that part, and us the viewers would never know.
It appears that all they did was to copy the old movie onto a DVD without any effort, knowing that many people will buy the DVD. I think that the video copy I have matches the DVD for picture quality, not for sound of course.
If you have Good Morning Vietnam on video treasure it and save yourself 15 ($20). Maybe in the future a 'special' anniversary edition will be released that the producers will have invested both time and money in to give us a DVD worth buying, of course they could just release it again as is for all us muggs to be ripped off again.",989971200,26,1606,4.134185303514377
542466,5,6303027016,"This is a rather old film on the Vietnam War. It has aged. The denunciation of the censorship that existed in the US forces in Vietnam, is still efficient, but it deals with the past. The Vietnam War is finished. The humor about the ex-Vice-Prsident Nixon, is of course a lot less efficient today, because a lot of time has gone by. The vision of the war is still very mild, though it emphasizes, still, the fact that the Viet Congs were everywhere, and it states in a very few sentences the real motivations of these young people who joined the fight against the Americans : personal, victims all around them, and the fact that they were at home, and the Americans were not.
But the film has taken, since its first release, a completely new meaning, more allegoric but also tremendously strong. This time it has do only with the functioning of an institution, no matter which, that has to respect some norms coming from above and not from its audience, its public. It has to do with censorship and the desire and tendency of some people to refuse it in the name of the good old freedom of expression and of the press. Just this point, repeated quite many times, shows how strong such a functioning is. But the film delves into the human relations that come along with this general functioning. Those who detain authority in this institution feel frustrated by those who rebel against the censorship they try to impose. And it reveals that the former will try to do anything they can do get rid of the troublemaker : they will send him on an impossible and death-ridden mission, hoping he will be killed ; then they will build up a file trying to show that he is a traitor and has to be courtmartialed, and then they will condescendently move him out of the way with a nice speech on generosity, clemency and even compassion. This denunciation of this terroristic functioning of any institution, public or private, is still valid and full of relevence. On that level the film has not aged one single iota.

542467,4,6303027016,"Thank goodness the directors and producers let Robin Williams do a little improvising in this film.  When Williams gets behind that microphone it is pure gold.  Some of his crazy ramblings have become part of my  vocabulary...much of this movie is highly quotable.
The setting is the  Viet Nam War, but the movie is not about the war itself.  There are moments  of culture clashes, government censorship, and pure hilarity.
Although  there are some tender and sad scenes in this film, the comic relief takes  the sting out of the meloncholy moments.
I gave this item a 3-star  review, not for its content, but because I think this would be better  rented than purchased.",963532800,,670,4.798245614035087
542468,5,6303027016,"One thing about this movie is that it is probably one of the best movies of the 80-s.
Another true fact is that Barry Levinson, Robin Williams and late J.T. Walsh will be remembered in 40 years time primarily because they  made GMV!.
It IS very funny (do not be tempted to watch in any other  language but original!) yet is a very serious film - definetely not Arnold  and Dolf type. It brings to attention just another side if Nam war but not  only. A delicate but nonetheless impressive show of characters under the  strain of another ""...for the sake of the nation...""  crusade.
No Vietnam theme is complete without GMV and it certainly  deserves buying a DVD player just to have this single movie in collection -  bacause you'll play it over and over again.
It is not enough to put  together light, film, camera and a few actors to make a movie. It takes  talent, luck and some majic to make real one. These guys had all three of  it.
A dope movie! Thank you, Touchstone...",953769600,5,977,4.402234636871508
