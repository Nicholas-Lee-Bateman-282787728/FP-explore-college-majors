The fist movie was OK so I went ahead and got the second one hoping it would be better...and again it was just OK.  Lacy is indeed a fashion reporter but her style seems more modern than in the books that focus on her love of vintage.  Also, in the books Lacy goes to Aunt Mimi's trunk for comfort...yet no trunk in the movie.  Vic is working for the police as opposed to his family security consulting company.  Stella now owns the hair salon which never happened in the book.  Also, Stella seems to have lost some of her style and doesn't boast about ""the girls"".  Brooke doesn't wear her hair braided and seems more sedate than her character in the book.

I know that in movies they tend to differ from the book but the characters are so different that it just disappoints at times.  I may have liked it better if I hadn't read the books.  The acting is OK for a made for TV movie but nothing spectacular.",1333238400,,981,4.248648648648649
