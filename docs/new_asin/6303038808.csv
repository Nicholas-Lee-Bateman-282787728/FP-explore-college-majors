7835176,3,6303038808,"It's hard to describe this odd and somewhat bizarre comedy by LeRoy Prinz and Hal roach Productions. The studio was famous for its shorts such as the Our Gang series and Laurel and Hardy's films. This film, running 53 minutes, is longer than a short subject and shorter than even a B-movie. Its subject matter and plot are so out there for 1941 that it's hard to imagine what the audience thought of it. The title contains a play on words that isn't clear today, and which seems to describe simply a wholesome co-ed. in 1941 however, the term ""All-American"" was strictly a masculine term used to describe an athlete, usually a football player. Thus the term ""All American Co-ed"" is self contradictory and connotes gender confusion, and that is what it is about in a mild way.

Imagine this opening: a Broadway-type chorus line of beautiful girls dancing on stage but filmed only from the waist down, climaxing with a close-up of their stocking clad legs. Pretty hot for 1941. But then the camera pulls back and the audience sees they're all guys in drag! What effect did that have on guys in the audience in 1941?  It seems the boys at Quinceton  College do a drag revue every year as part of an old tradition and get a lot of press for it. it also happens that nearby Mar Bryn college for girls prints a scathing review of the show which upsets the Quinceton boys terribly

Mat Bryn is about to be forced to close due to lack of admissions. But the girls and their college president come up with an idea to invite various beauty contest winners to tour the campus and by admitting them, the school could shed its dowdy image. Publicized in the newspaper, the Quinceton boys get the idea to send All American fratboy Bob Sheppard (Johnny Downs) disgiused as a potential co-ed to ruin Mar Bryn's little publicity stunt.  Johnny Downs in drag is about as convincing as Tony Curtis and jack Lemon in drag in Some Like it Hot, but as in that film, everyone is fooled. One big problem arises; Bob is totally smitten by pretty co-ed Virginia Collinge (Frances Langford) who happens to be the niece of college president Matilda Collinge.

The plot proceeds from there in what would have been a very slight and unremarkable comedy had it not been for the drag aspect which was so far ahead of its time that I'm surprised the Hays Office allowed it.  Of course the gender switch is entirely superficial and I'm . really not giving anything away to say that in the end, Bob and Virginia get together. The best thing the film offers is Frances Langford singing Out of the Silence. I can only find it an amusing oddity of its time but there are some people who really like it. it's competently made by well-known choreographer Leroy Prinz who also did Yankee Doodle Dandy, April In Paris and Lullaby of Broadway in his long career. It moves by very quickly in its under an hour format.",1458345600,,2873,4.5347490347490345

7835179,3,6303038808,"As far back as 1941, someone pondered the seemingly unlimited potential of motion pictures and decided that the world really needed to see men in drag.  I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, but All American Co-ed actually succeeds quite well as an entertaining diversion.  Lest you see the name of Alan Hale, Jr. (better known as the Skipper from Gilligan's Island) in the cast list and panic, let me assure you that his small role is not a cross-dressing one; he's basically just a cotton-seed character.  Bob Sheppard (Johnny Downs), though, spends a Flip Wilson-ish amount of time in dresses, however, for he (uh, she) is the point man (uh, woman) in a plot pitting two schools against one another.  Mar Brynn is a girl's school famous for its traditionalist (meaning anti-male) foundation; unfortunately, it's not exactly prospering.  To engineer some positive publicity, twelve scholarships are given out to girls brandishing special credentials.  Nearby, at the all-boy Quinceton school, the Zeta fraternity brothers get their kicks by dressing up and performing as women.  For reasons beyond my comprehension, Mar Brynn uses a reference to the Zeta drag queens as a publicity stunt, leaving the boys yearning for revenge.  What better revenge could there by than passing one of their own off as a young lady and securing a scholarship to the all-girl school?
Naturally, you have a lot of jokes built around Bob trying to keep ""Bobbie's"" secret long enough to embarrass Mar Brynn at the appropriate time.  Love ends up changing everyone's plans, but I probably don't need to even tell you that.  It's all rather predictable, but the movie's assortment of musical numbers, tried-and-true comedy bits, and relatively short running time (clocking in at just over 48 minutes) allows All American Co-ed to succeed as a musical comedy that doesn't have time to grow old and annoying.",1080864000,,1886,5.054838709677419
7835180,3,6303038808,"The titles appear over a chorus line of shapely legs.  When the camera pans up after the directorial credit, we are on stage with a drag show musical number in full swing.  This short (51 minute) musical oddity has  great tunes (an Oscar nomination for Best Score), cute guys and a  ""Some Like It Hot"" cross-dressing plot that's a hoot. The male  lead is far better as a girl than as himself.  A totally unexpected  delight that demands a cult following!",933206400,2,454,4.530864197530864
