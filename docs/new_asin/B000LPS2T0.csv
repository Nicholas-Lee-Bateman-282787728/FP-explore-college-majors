8163215,5,B000LPS2T0,Made in America is a great DVD series to watch by yourself or with a friend or spouse.  Each episode informs you how three different companies began and continue to thrive in the U.S.  The shows are only half-an-hour so they are perfect for watching while you're having a meal or just need a short break!,1296345600,,304,4.410714285714286

Ordered this set because we missed several of the segments included, and wish the program was still active.  Product arrived well-packaged, and was delivered in a very timely manner.  Quality is excellent, and we enjoy viewing the stories...even the repeats.",1227312000,,470,8.176470588235293
8163221,5,B000LPS2T0,"Having seen this show many times. I can tell the DVD is going to be great.

But I have to make a correction on the other guys review. John did NOT play Norm on Cheers, he was Cliff the mailman. And was brilliant in that role.

I am truly glad that we have people like him who go all around America and like he says ""finding it's soul everywhere""",1216339200,8,345,3.9855072463768115
