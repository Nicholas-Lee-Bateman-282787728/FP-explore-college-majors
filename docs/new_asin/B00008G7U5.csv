After the first couple of minutes, the guy has you playing blues riffs and explaining how a G can sometimes be an A, but a F is always an F, but sometimes a B can be a C and a D can be a G sharp other times, blah blah blah...whatever!
I mean come on...to be a BEGINNING instructional format this moves way too fast too soon.  I should have listened to my inner voice when it arrived and resisted opening it to exchange it for something else but I didn't.
Looks like it will be garage sale fodder.",1237420800,3,674,4.122137404580153
