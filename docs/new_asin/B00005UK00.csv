7954794,4,B00005UK00,"I love Tom, and to find this DVD of his early stuff was a treat. Im from his hometown and it was CRAZY to see him pulling stunts downtown where Im from-Ottawa. He's so original and halarious! This DVD is so funny, with classic clips like the painting of his parents house plaid, an mc face song about phil, celery generals...I could go on and on. Its a real funny movie to just sit with your buddies and laugh at. It will make you love him even more.",1123200000,,450,4.125
7954795,5,B00005UK00,This is a very good dvd if you like funny shows such as TOM GREEN. It is funny from beginning to end. Its only ten bucks so go buy it.,1078358400,10,134,3.5
7954796,5,B00005UK00,"This DVD has the best of his skits from his earliest days trying to make it big (1992-1994). Some of the best skits are Follow The Porn, Search for CHUD, Celery Generals, The canoe trip, Bread head, Creamy hands, and so many more of them. Funny music videos towards the end too. The editing between skits is a little weird, but they are all master tapes. If you were a fan of Tom's run on MTV, you'll love this DVD to add to your collection. Highly recomended for any Tom fan. I also recomend The Tom Green Show: Endangered Feces. It has more skits, and its even funnier.",1055462400,16,571,4.296296296296297
7954797,4,B00005UK00,"This is the earliest of the early....before his break on Canada's Comdey Channel.....before MTV.....before his Hollywood appearances.
Alot of us here in Ontario, Canada remember when Tom Green first came along. He was that weird, off the wall 23 year old...with a smart-aleck answer for everything. Teasing people, making strange faces and causing a scene everywhere he went, this guy had us all sitting at home saying ""who IS this nut?"" He was like nothing any of us had ever seen before.
On this DVD you'll see a very low budget version of the Tom Green Show. This is young Tom, still trying to get his big break. Keep in mind that this footage is raw, and by that I mean poor. The sound is not perfect, nor is the picture quality. But man, it's funny stuff! This is all of the early material that got Tom a cult following in Ontario...and then all over Canada. Along with him as always, is Glenn & Phil. You'll also see Derek, an old friend from the Canadian version of the show.",1029369600,8,982,4.4916201117318435
