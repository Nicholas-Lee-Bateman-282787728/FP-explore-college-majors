8438244,1,B0043X1FSG,"Even if the budget was only $10 USD WHY waste $10 to make a movie like THIS???  Were they hoping it is so poor that it would become a cult classic? True that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was made on a tiny budget, BUT the size of the budget does not a cult classic make. There is no story here. It is a garbled compilation of shots that in someone's mind means something. For our sakes, I hope that someone is locked snugly away in an institution.  I gave it a chance, and it crapped all over itself.",1359763200,,496,4.0
8438245,4,B0043X1FSG,"Obviously produced on a tiny budget, I thought this film
had some really interesting & exciting moments.  Very similar
to what would have played on a drive-in screen back in the 70's.
If you're a fan of underground horror, I would certainly
recommend giving this one a try.  From the director of
""The Necro Files"" & ""Back From Hell"".",1319760000,,333,4.627118644067797
8438246,1,B0043X1FSG,"Giving one star is to generous.  Amazon should add a zero category.

The ladies hair on the box is blond but in the movie, she is a brunette.",1304035200,4,141,4.0
8438247,1,B0043X1FSG,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, there is no real action, and the ""plot"" is ridiculous.
The loose plot revolves around this detective getting kidnapped by this drug cult. They dress up in black trash bags and wear masks, and there seem to be more of them than actual citizens in the movie. They kidnap the cop. The girlfriend convinces the police chief to go after him. He tracks the cop with a gps device. No joke. The Chief and gf track him to a building...where they get trapped in a room and sit for hours. No, really.
Side plot, another cop shoots a beggar by accident.
I won't ruin the ending, in case you do watch it. But coming from someone who likes to watch bad movies, this wasn't even ""good"" bad, or ""funny"" bad. It's all bad, and afterwards you will wonder what you are doing with your life.",1295568000,5,846,4.327044025157233
