7842432,4,6303283373,"NOTE - This review is for Fat Burner only.

This is a short but high energy low impact aerobics workout led by Gay Gasper, she is joined by Yesh and Lisa. The whole thing is about 20 minutes including warmup and cooldown.

The setting is the same as Sensational Step, the choreography is pretty simple to pick up.  Step taps, hamstring curls, mambos, cha chas, grapevines, knee lifts, lunge steps, plus a few turns added here and there are about all this routine contains.  It's a decent routine but too short for anyone to really get anything out of it.  I often do it as an add on to other workouts.

These 2 tape sets would be a better deal if they were a little longer, of course I can't comment on the entire series as I haven't tried them all.  I have enjoyed trying the few I have though, fun to see a younger Gay Gasper who is one of my favorite instructors.

I can't comment on Buns and Thighs as I haven't done it.

Overall, I give Fat Burner 4 stars, I don't use it a ton but it's fun once in a while.",1259280000,,1012,4.122448979591836

7842434,3,6303283373,"The exercises were good, but nothing new (squats and lunges.)  The cheerleaders, however, were pretty lame.  Some weren't doing the moves right (improper placement of feet, etc.) and it was really annoying to hear the ""head cheerleader"" repeat everything that Gay said: ""Six more!"" Blonde leader: ""Six more!""  Gay: ""Feet apart!""  Blonde leader: ""Feet apart!""  Are they hard of hearing or what?  The constant prattle was more annoying than inspirational.  I won't be keeping this one.",1113609600,,483,5.276315789473684
7842435,5,6303283373,"When I first realized that I was gaining a few pounds, I decided to take action.  I bought the Buns & Thighs and Fat Burner tapes and used them each every other day.  Within two months, I had more toned legs and a flatter stomach.  I am in the process of acquiring Awesome Abs/Sensational Step, and the two Advanced Abs tapes, and I will write a review for them as soon as I can see a difference.  GASPER IS THE BEST!",1023062400,,417,4.111111111111111

7842437,5,6303283373,"I have both of these sets of videos.  I bought them at blockbuster about 5 years ago.  I have used them off and on ever since.  I will be the first one to tell you all four videos that I do have, really put you through a great workout!  This past time when I realized that I had put on some serious weight, I started using the videos and in 2 months I lost 30lbs. I also watched my eating within reason but all I do is rotate between them.  I also did them everyday when I started.  I just looked this up because I want more of her tapes! She's awesome!",1014854400,2,553,3.892857142857143
