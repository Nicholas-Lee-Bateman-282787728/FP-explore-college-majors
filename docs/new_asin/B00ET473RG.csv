8609184,3,B00ET473RG,"Probably good. However it was hard to enjoy because the reqding of the fast changing subtitles didn't allow enough time to enjoy the design of the movie.  3D was ok but not great.  If you don't understand Japanese I recommend better to go with English dub. I didn't see 3D with English.

8609190,5,B00ET473RG,"Ok so the movie itself is pretty great overall content-wise, especially for the fans of Stand Alone Complex who have followed the series through both seasons (although I have to say I didn't particularly care for the Major's decision at the end, seemed like a bit of a cop-out, but that's a minor gripe). So I want to talk about this disc. First I would say it is absolutely worth it for the 3D, even for those who have seen the regular 2D version. The 3D really pops in scenes with lots of CG, as in going into the net, the HUD points of view, the vehicles- all of which look very cool in 3D. The 3D is less apparent in the 2D animation- there it focuses more on depth, but I'd say it does very well overall, much better than I expected.

Now for the problem- the English subtitles are pretty terrible. There are many instances of missing words, and even worse, many times the subtitles flash by so quickly that unless you are a speed reader, you are going to miss them. If you are already familiar with the movie, it's not so much an issue as it would be if you're watching it for the first time (have the remote nearby to rewind a lot). I'm guessing that the quality of the English subtitles were probably not that high a priority since this is the Japanese version of the film. So please make note of that- this disc is the only way to get the 3D version of the film as far as I know- the US only ever got the 2D version on Blu Ray. But being a Region 1 disc, it plays fine in US Blu Ray players. Also note that there is no English dub, so you are stuck with the sub par subtitles. But It is nice to have both the 2D and 3D versions of the film on one disc, and there are some extras featuring the Tachikomas that I haven't seen yet.

But even with the bad subtitle situation, as a fan I really enjoyed the film, and particularly this 3D version of it, enough so to make up for the poor subtitle job. 4.5 out of 5.",1431561600,5,1918,4.084880636604774
8609191,5,B00ET473RG,"watched this on my 80"" Vizio 3D tv, all I can say is WOW. the 3D was fantastic. in a way wish movie was dubbed, but I have gotten used to subtitles, at least the dialogue matches the mouth movements lol. when I purchased this said it was last one. wooot. anyone know if they will convert anymore GiTs to 3D ?",1430524800,,308,3.9838709677419355
8609192,5,B00ET473RG,This is really good! The 3d really pops out. I didn't have any trouble with cross talk. Clean and crisp. A great addition for any ghost in the shell fan,1424822400,,152,4.1
8609193,5,B00ET473RG,Awesom! Wish there were more 3d versions of all the Ghost in the Shell movies & series!!!,1417910400,,89,4.294117647058823
