8242201,4,B0011TGK0I,"I'm giving this product a 4-rating because these highlight films are usually terrific. But I want to ask--in this one, do the U of M's Golden Gophers get ""a fair shake""? Are they shown much? The NCAA has certain schools it flexes it's muscles on (don't Notre Dame and Michigan EVER bend the rules a bit?)and Minnesota is one of them. Because one player was accused of academic cheating, the Gophers' record is officially 0-27 (or so). This MN team was ranked #1 in the nation for a time, had incredible athletes that grew into fine men, and are the only Minnesota mens BB team to get this far. The bullying NCAA gave the Scarlett Letter to another Gopher basketball team that should be in the history books: that of Mychal Thompson in the 70's. As a Minnesota alum weary of the NCAA brass picking on the Minnesotas and it's other usual suspects all of the time, I want to know if this is worth plunking down $25 for? Anyone?",1202601600,,924,4.4411764705882355
