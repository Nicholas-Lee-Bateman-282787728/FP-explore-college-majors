2874810,5,B000RPV8M2,"Excellent series!!! I borrowed these from our local library, but really want to purchase the whole collection. I know my family would enjoy watching it for years. They all got into the stories once they started catching parts of episodes that I was watching. They don't make pure shows like this anymore...I thought it rivaled Little House on the Prairie, but was even better because of the Victorian time period styles and history.",1445904000,,432,4.931506849315069

2874817,5,B000RPV8M2,"The stories in Road to Avonlea are based on LM Montgomery's works, the same author who gave us the beloved Anne of Green Gables: The Collection stories (my all-time favorite childhood show!).

The story in Road to Avonlea focuses on young Sara Stanley who is a rich girl living with her father in Montreal, Canada. When her father is wrongly accused of embezzlement, Sara is sent to live with her deceased mother's relatives on Prince Edward Island. Sara is accompanied by her long-time nanny, Louisa, and although they are meant to live with Uncle Alec and his family, the lack of room makes it necessary for Sara and Louisa to live with Sara's Aunt Hetty, an old schoolmistress, and Aunt Olivia, a gentle and kind soul.

The stories is Season One focus on how Sara settles into her new surroundings, learning to live without the comforts of the big city, and having to do things for herself, yet loving the fresh and wild country air and surroundings, as well as the love and companionship of an extended family. Sara's cousins, i.e. vain Felicity King, naughty Felix, cute and kind Cecily, brainy Andrew, and farmhand Peter all get into scrapes of one kind or another, with Sara usually right in the thick of it! This makes the show engaging and fun to watch, not just for children but adults as well. It is perfect family-friendly drama. Some reviewers have taken issue with the depiction of the women of Avonlea as gossip-mongers and spiteful. Although at times it does appear that there is an abundance of idle chit-chat and gossip in some episodes, there is always a positive message at the end of each episode, where certain characters learn how to acknowledge their flaws and become better individuals.

The episodes featured here include:
The Journey Begins - how Sara comes to Avonlea
The Story Girl - Sara decides to help raise funds for the school library
The Materializing of Duncan McTavish - Marilla Cuthbert (Collen Dewhurst from Anne of Green of Gables) surprises everyone with the revelation of a long lost love
Old Lady Lloyd - a old lady and recluse intrigues Sara, especially when Sara senses a link between Old Lady Lloyd and a lovely young visitor blessed with a beautiful voice
Proof of the Pudding - Felicity is appointed in charge when her parents go out of town, and mayhem ensues
Conversions - focuses on the townfolks' prejudice against Peg Bowen, the local witch
Aunt Abigail - Janet King's spinster sister is surprised when an old flame comes back into her life
Malcolm - an orphaned baby stirs up the emotions of Hetty, Rachel Lynde, and a newly married couple
Felicity's Challenge - Felicity gives in to peer pressure, but ends up hurting her closest friends.
The Hope Chest of Arabella King - Olivia discovers a passion for writing, but needs to convince the local newspaper owner that she has a story worth writing about
Nothing Endures But Change

In the second season, young Sara Stanley & her friends find more adventures, with the introduction of some new characters.
The episodes in this season are:
Sara's Homecoming : Sara returns to Avonlea after a family tragedy. A sad episode.
How Kissing was Discovered : the blossoming Felicity King pines for love, and suffers a crush... also we are introduced to a new character, Gus Pike, a young man who has a sad past.
Aunt Hetty's ordeal : Hetty King is visited by her old rival, Ms Stacey [the very same Ms Stacey, Anne's mentor in Anne of Green Gables]
Of Corsets, and Secrets, and True, True Love: Marilla takes in two orphaned relatives, much to Rachel's chagrin, and the ensuing pandemonium is hilarious.
Old Quarrels, Old Love: Hetty King and her old beau are reunited. A sad episode.
May the Best Man win: Olivia King is wooed by two men, the reliable Jasper Dale, and the pompous ex-beau who abandoned her once before.
Family Rivalry: The other King sibling, Roger, returns for a brief visit, but things are not all rosy with the King clan.
The Sea Ghost : Michael York plays an old seaman here. Gus Pike's past returns to haunt him.
All that Glitters : the possibility of hidden treasure on the island proves too hard to resist for Sara, Gus and friends.
Dreamer of Dreams : focuses on Jasper Dale
It's Just a Stage: Sara's aunt, a famous stage actress comes to visit, with unsettling consequences.
A Mother's Love: does one have to have experienced childbirth to be a 'real' mother? Avonlea is abuzz with the essay competition for Mother's Day.
Misfits & Miracles: Ms Stacey brings a directive that the Avonlea school is to field a hockey team, and Sara tries to learn how to skate. Also, the theme of development in the town is highlighted here.

The second season is as good or better than the first. The storylines flow smoothly, and the acting is excellent. We also notice the development of some of the characters, such as Gus Pike, whose story is developed this season. Olivia and Jasper are edging closer to being more than friends, and Sara is truly at home in Avonlea. This is one of my favorite television series, and reminds me of a much more innocent time, when children truly lived their childhoods, and where good values were treasured and honored.

Season 3 happens to be one of the best seasons in the series (there are seven of them in all) and the episodes are:
The Ties that Bind - explores both Hetty and Olivia's feelings as Olivia's marriage to Jasper looms on the horizon.
But When She Was Bad...She was Horrid (Parts 1 & 2) - Sara Stanley, Hetty's niece is frustrated by what she perceives as her aunt controlling her life and runs away. A double stands in for her with predictably hilarious results.
Felix and Blackie - Felix's entrepreneurial adventure with his horse Blackie.
Another Point of View -  Hetty resigns from her teaching post and is perturbed to find her replacement using unconventional methods in his teaching.
Aunt Janet Rebels - Aunt Janet puts her own marriage at risk by fighting for women's right to vote.
A Dark and Stormy Night - Gus Pike finds employment at the White Sands hotel and gets involved in some mysterious activities.
Friends and Relations - a fun episode where Sara and Felicity take charge of their naughty cousin Lucky as the adults pursue their own interests.
Vows of Silence - Felicity finds herself in a pickle when she loses her mother's family heirloom which she took without Janet's permission.
After the Honeymoon - Olivia tries to overcome her own fears to support her husband's work which involves research on bats.
High Society - Felicity employs duplicity when she is offered a chance at winning a prestigious scholarship to a renowned ladies college.
The Calamitous Courting of Hetty King - the romantic misadventures of Aunt Hetty.
Old Friends, Old Wounds - death of a well-liked inhabitant in the town.

Season 4 has the following episodes:
Tug of War - the Dale clan comes to Avonlea and mayhem ensues
Lady and the Blade - Hetty takes up writing and a new schoolmaster begins teaching but his methods prove to be too draconian
Incident at Vernon River - Felix is frustrated when he does not receive the much longed for rifle for his birthday and sneaks it out to use it, with serious consequences.
Boys will be Boys - Avonlea starts up its own Fire Department and both Alec and Clive find themselves in a rivalry for the post of Chief Fireman
Moving On - a wild west show comes to Avonlea and Sara becomes infatuated with Marshall Zac Morgan.
Evelyn - Alec's childhood friend returns to Avonlea with a young wife and child, and when tragedy strikes, Alec tries his best to help his friend's wife, setting tongues wagging.
The Dinner - Felicity lies to almost everyone around her in order to have a private moment with Gus.
Heirs and Graces - speculation abounds about the White Sands new owner's Simon Tremayne's background
Hearts and Flowers - Gus Pike and Arthur Pettibone both compete to take Felicity to the Valentine's Day dance; Chef Piere's niece Suzette comes for a visit and is infatuated with Gus.
Felicity's Perfect Beau - Felicity finds herself being pursued by two men, Gus Pike and Arthur Pettibone, and is not sure who she likes best.
The Disappearance - Sara thinks she will make a good writer and meets someone who may not be what he seems.
Home Movie - Hetty King finds herself up in arms when a developer offers to buy up land from Avonlea residents; Jasper makes a movie about life in Avonlea starring its residents
Hearth and Home - Aunt Eliza returns to Avonlea and feels unwanted.

Season 5 begins with the episode, ""Fathers and Sons"", one of the highlights of the season and also one that is bittersweet. Alec King (Cedric Smith) places heavy demands on his young son, Felix (Zachary Bennett)who is to inherit the King farm someday. Felix on the other hand has no real interest in the farm, preferring to work at the White Sands Hotel and dreams of opening his own Tea Room someday. This predictably does not go down well with Alex who takes pride in adhering to family traditions, but slowly comes to the realization that Felix needs to be able to have a dream of his own, and perhaps traditions can be changed. This happens to be one of my favorite RTA episodes!

The other episodes this season are:
Memento Mori - birthday celebrations for Hetty King's 50th do not turn out as expected
Modern Times - Hetty buys the cannery to prevent it from being turned into a distillery; Jasper and Olivia wish to buy the cannery despite their own financial troubles
A Friend in Need - Hetty and Sara babysit the Keith twins whilst Rachel Lynde goes out of town; Izzy Pettibone outgrows her tomboy phase
Strictly Melodrama - Janet and Hetty come to blows over a play
The Great Race - Felix enters a horse race despite Janet's misgivings
Stranger in the Night - Alec hires a new farmhand Caleb Stokes who might be hiding something
Someone to Believe In - Alec King gets involved in politics, and so does Felix, in a manner of speaking
Thursday's Child - tragedy strikes the King family when Cecily contracts TB
Best Laid Plans - Jasper comes up with a new invention but his unscrupulous cousin may get in the way of the Dales' success
Otherwise Engaged - Gus Pike proposes to Felicity King, but will Felicity accept given her desire to go to medical school?
Enter Prince Charming - Sara becomes involved with the new minister's son - a romantic episode and sees Sara's maturing into a young woman
The Minister's Wife - Janet and the Minister's wife get into trouble

In the Sixth Season of RTA, we do not get to see much of familiar characters Sara Stanley and Gus Pike, but the series manages to move along with the other supporting cast. Gus Pike's past is finally revealed in this season, and Sarah Stanley is all grown-up and making her own decisions regarding her future which also takes her away from Avonlea. Felicity King tries medical school, makes a success of her first year, but a personal tragedy drives her away from medicine.

There is a lot of focus on Davey Keith this season, a plot line I did not personally care for. Despite sympathizing with his plight as an orphan, I would rather have seen more focus on some of the other beloved characters such as Janet, Alec, and Hetty. I wonder if the focus on the younger characters was an attempt at trying to get a couple of more seasons in the series by following these characters as they grew up. Sadly, the appeal of the first batch of youngsters in the earlier seasons of RTA (focusing on Sara Stanley, Felicity King, Felix King, and Gus Pike) could not be replicated with Dora, Davey, and Izzy.

The Return of Gus Pike - Felicity King struggles as the only female student in medical school, then spots her old love, Gus Pike in Halifax. The pair meet a strange woman who appears to recognize Gus' ruby ring and the name Ezekiel Crane. This prompts Gus to take the woman, Eliza back to Avonlea, in a bid to discover the truth about his past. A very poignant episode.

Lonely Hearts - Avonlea has its first annual bachelor auction with hilarious results.

Christmas in June - back at the sanatorium, Cecily gets into trouble after befriending a rascal named Louie. Note: There is a casting change - the actress that played Cecily in past seasons of RTA, i.e. Harmony Cramp is replaced by Molly Atkinson who gives a more assertive interpretation of Cecily which is apt considering all that her character has been through after her bout with TB.

Fools and Kings - with Felicity away at medical school and Daniel away on a trip, Janet finds herself at a loss as to what to do and decides to work at home for ACME company; Alex plans to induct Felix into the Knights of P.E.I.; Hetty and the Daughters of the Dominion take on their rivals, the Knights of P.E.I.

Comings and Goings - Sara Stanley returns to Avonlea after six months, accompanied by nanny Louisa. Both Hetty and Louisa bicker (as usual) over Sara's future, but Sara has her own plans. Will they stop long enough to listen?

The Trouble with Davey - Rachel Lynde has her hands full caring for twins Davey and Dora, and when she suffers a stroke, Hetty King steps in to help. Rachel's son takes her back to live with him, and Hetty is left to care for the twins, finding Davey a handful.

Great Expectations - Davey Keith gets into trouble (as usual), and Hetty tries to teach him the value of school by using reverse psychology (sending him to work at the cannery). The plan backfires when Jasper Dale sympathizes with Davey's plight and acts as his mentor. It's funny how Jasper always seems to be inventing things ahead of his time but never receives the recognition or fame for it (in this episode he invents the vacuum cleaner, and Hetty gets to experience its `merits' firsthand, lol).

A Fox Tale - Felix and Izzy go into business together, starting a fox farm. Their friendship is threatened when Felix decides to take someone else as his partner because of financial constraints.

The More Things Change - The romance of Clive Pettibone and Muriel Stacey proceeds to the next level but not without complications.

Home is Where the Heart Is - Rachel Lynde suffers a severe stroke, and Hetty nurses her back to health. Rachel loses her ability to speak, but true to her indomitable spirit, refuses to give up.

What a Tangled Web We Weave - the White Sands hosts a grand society wedding but turns out that both the bride and groom may not come from such exalted backgrounds after all; Felix fails his English exam and may not graduate. His self-esteem takes a battering, causing him to consider leaving Avonlea.

A Time to Every Purpose - Felicity misses the registration deadline for second-year medical school and is stuck in Avonlea. Dr. Snow employs her as his assistant but she finds his approach to medicine rather old-fashioned. Felicity's childhood friend Colleen is expecting but when the delivery goes terribly awry, Felicity has doubts about her future in medicine.

Homecoming - Cecily returns home after her bout in the sanatorium but chafes under the strict supervision of her parents and family, yearning for freedom and to be treated as normal. The townsfolk's prejudice does not help either. The telephone exchange comes to Avonlea and Felicity receives some tragic news.

Final verdict - still a fun season, but missing the magic of the earlier seasons.

Season Seven is the concluding season of RTA and is bittersweet. Here are the episodes:
Out of the Ashes - Felicity sinks into depression over Gus; there's a new town banker Stuart Mcrae and a budding romance develops between Felicity and Stuart.
Love May be Blind...But the Neighbors Ain't - Felix and Izzy's romance gets the gossip mill going; Eulalie starts spreading rumors that the Dales' are getting a divorce.
Davey and the Mermaid - Davey gets charmed by the `mermaid' when the travelling Midway comes to Avonlea.
Woman of Importance - Izzy's Aunt Lillian conceals her failed business dealings and tries to lure Izzy to Boston.
Secrets and Sacrifices - Janet's annoying sister Abigail returns to Avonlea; Janet thinks her wedding ring is lost.
King of the Great White Way - Alec receives an offer to perform on Broadway.
Total Eclipse - Felix gets into trouble
Ah...Sweet Mystery of Life - Hetty is given an ultimatum - teach in Carmody or resign; romance between Hetty and Simon gets serious and also faces strain.
From Away - Davey gets into trouble, as usual.
After the Ball is Over - Eliza Ward's 90th birthday celebration reveals some secrets from the past.
Return to Me - On the eve of her wedding, Felicity receives a disturbing call that makes her think Gus is alive. This takes Felicity and Hetty to South Carolina.
The Last Hurrah - the Dale cannery gets destroyed in a fire
So Dear to My Heart - Felicity chooses to marry Gus; Gus undergoes an eye surgery; Hetty boycott's the wedding.
Conclusion - Road to Avonlea is one of the best family series and period shows on television and will always remain a favorite.",1290297600,15,16929,4.6855028590649175
2874818,5,B000RPV8M2,"I watched the last of the seven seasons last night, and was so sorry to see it end.  So refreshing.  This series from beginning to end was excellent.  It was amazing how every episode was so different and yet so entertaining.  I laughed, cried and enjoyed every minute.  The costumes, scenery and plots were so diverse that one never becomes bored watching.  I tucked away the all worries and cares of today's world and, for a while each evening (seven seasons is a long time), I was taken back in time to a simpler life.
