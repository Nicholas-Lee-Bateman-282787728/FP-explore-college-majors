6589902,1,B00MN9PQ0A,"The once brilliantly written series hit bottom this season with tacky episodes based on the trashiest of tabloid stories--for example, O.J. Simpson's hypothetical book about what would have transpired had he killed his wife; the death of Anna Nicole Smith's son; the transgressions of that creepy ""Girls Gone Wild"" guy. The absolute nadir is an episode inspired by Mel Gibson's drunk-driving arrest starring Chevy Chase doing the worst acting job of his life (and that's really saying something). The writing staff seem to have had two priorities: putting in as little effort as possible and depicting as many venal, stupid, pathetic, shallow, despicable characters as they could.

Thoroughly depressing. Don't waste your money.",1416787200,4,728,5.442477876106195

6589910,4,B00MN9PQ0A,"I enjoy this show so much. This season threw me a little, because I don't have the sixteenth season, but hopefully I will get it soon. Then I can watch the entire series from beginning to end. Though I like the new shows my favorites are still the first few seasons when they investigated & prosecuted crimes other than murder. Also, as much as I like Sam Watterson, I really liked Michael Moriarty. While the new actors are good there is always a yearning for the earlier characters, especially Lenny. I will really miss Jerry Orbach. & I really liked Angie Harmon, but I have been following her on other shows. It was nice to see a conservative prosecutor, instead of two liberal ones.",1447718400,,687,4.548387096774194

6589925,3,B00MN9PQ0A,"I love this series. However, this was the first time I didn't feel like I understood the character of the 1st assistant DA. Even though I think she is a great cast member. She was the first one I didn't get to know in the first season she was on the show. The new detective was just too forced. Trying to make her the bad cop like Logan or Curtis was not smart. I wasn't expecting a pushover but her performance seems she was trying too hard.
The stories were still strong but some felt a little long as if they were season fillers.
You felt the end of this series coming to an end in this particular season.",1427587200,,608,4.117647058823529
