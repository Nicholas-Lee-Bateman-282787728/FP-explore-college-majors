2761289,5,B000N8UXTW,"Ever since the inaugural season of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" found its way to DVD in September 2004, the company releasing the seasons settled on a ""3-per-year"" plan--one in September, December, and May--until all 9 seasons were out. Loyal fans were shocked and nervous to find no Season 8 in stores in its due month--December 2006--but with the set slated for delivery in May, all of the worrying is offically over! :)

Just about everyone who loves this series is familiar with its remarkable success on television. Many TV shows are lucky to just get some noteworthy material in its later years, but ""Raymond"" is an incredible exception--it has always characterized fresh writing, hysterically funny storylines, and priceless banter between the Barone characters we have grown to love.

With soulmates Robert and Amy finally married and savoring the ""newlywed"" life together, Season 8 opens with a hilarious bang. What will Marie do to hound her new daughter-in-law the second she and Robert return from their honeymoon--and how far will Debra go to make an ally out of Amy so that together, they may overthrow Marie's meddlesome ways for good? If that sounds like good old ""Raymond"" material to you, then you're absolutely right--and it is sure to keep you laughing all the way through.

Beyond the classic episode entitled ""Thank You Notes,"" the entire year sparkles with plenty of great moments. Because Amy is now an official member of the family, so are her kooky-as-heck parents and brother--and for the Barone clan, that means unannounced visitors on the couch, Thanksgiving celebrations that are even more dysfunctional than usual, and poor Robert's perpetual fight to earn the respect of his wife's tightly-wound parents. Meanwhile, Debra starts spending time with Frank's buddies at the lodge; Ray receives a special writing honor (cap and gown and all!) and forgets to mention Debra in his lengthy acceptance speech; husband and wife get into arguments (wow, who would have guessed?) and Robert becomes the target of further scrutiny when the family attempts to break him of his trademark chin habit. The Barone kids, too, are growing up quickly and keeping their parents on their toes. One of the twins suddenly takes to staying home from school on a regular basis, much to Ray's annoyance (especially when he ends up having to stay home with the kid). Teenager Ally is invited to her best friend's 13th birthday bash.....with a $250 dress code.....and a woman by the name of ""Peggy, the Cookie Lady"" organizing the whole thing. Let's see, how in the world will Raymond react to that one?

Bottom line, if you adore this show as much as I do, you'll want to pick this season up as soon as it comes out. The typical bloopers, deleted scenes, and commentaries--which have managed to please everyone quite nicely in the past--will be among the special features included. The final Season 9 can't be too far behind now, and as for me, I look forward to officially topping off my DVD collection of the greatest TV show of all time! (Well, in my opinion anyway)",1172793600,40,3070,4.9437984496124034

2761294,5,B000N8UXTW,"THIS SHOW IS GREAT!  No cussing. No crude sex scenes or crude or gross subjects. (other than perhaps, comments about Frank's toenails... :) tee hee).  It's a hilarious half hour of belly laughs, - the kind of shows we once found all over the tv channels when I was young.  Sadly, those days are GONE! Just TRY to find some decent sitcoms without blood, gore, raw sexual discussions & language or pushing some new cultural offensive life-style into our living rooms, affecting & confusing our children & grandchildren. You won't find ANY!  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" television shows are well worth buying, renting, & collecting them all...

The mothers duplicity is regrettable while the brothers angry tone toward Ray is more re-current.

These include ""Home from School"" where Ray and Debra can't get Michael to go to school, ""Peter on the Couch"" where Amy's brother moves in with Robert and Amy, and ""The Model"" where Robert gets conned into thinking he can be a model.  It also includes the episode ""Lateness"" where Ray decides to leave Debra at home because he is tired of waiting for her - something I have always wanted to try but never had the guts to do...",1244246400,,643,4.262295081967213

Each disk is individually labeled with the episode titles.  I had never seen any Everybody Loves Raymond episodes until seeing one with my boyfriend who was already a fan, I was immediately hooked.  Being a nightly after dinner show it was very convenient to watch.  Although the season finale was aired soon after I got hooked to the comedy, the show is so popular that reruns are still on every night which helps to get me caught up on everything that I have missed, especially the episodes of the seasons which I have not bought yet.
Another reason why this comedy is so easy to get hooked to is that the characters are seen throughout many seasons.  We see the kids grow up and marriages form.  It is not a love story but a comedy set around an everyday family with annoying parents as neighbors.",1224028800,,933,4.3895348837209305

2761485,4,B000N8UXTW,"Not quiet as good as past seasons but specially gratifying if you get it at a good discount, like I did. It is normal for every show to run out of ideas with time but all things considered ELR wasn't that bad, specially since season 8 might have just been an improvement over the less inspired #7. I specially enjoyed the ""Lateness"" episode in which I found as much truth and uneasiness as in the classic ""The Cannister"", in other words, something like this could happen to you (and probably has). I also think the ""Misery loves company"" episode is one of the best of the series, for a second there you can sense there is more than a glimpse of knowledge in Frank and Marie constantly beligerant attitude toward each other.
I have a collection of TV shows (Cheers, Seinfeld, Taxi, Happy Days,24 etc.) but only in the case of 1 specific show I have bought every available episode: (to put it in Robert's words: Raymond, Raymond, Raymond,....) Case closed.",1217980800,,954,4.584795321637427

For starters, the Puritan beliefs are a great contrast to the outrageous antics of Ray Barone (Ray Romano)'s parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts).  They make several appearances during the course of season eight.  What's more, the rest of the ensemble maintains a joyous atmosphere of neurosis and genuinely human flaws.

2761500,5,B000N8UXTW,"After eight seasons, the Barones are still bringing new laughs in every episode -- especially now that the family has expanded to include the parents and brother of Robert's new bride, Amy.

New territory is covered, as Ally enters her teens, as well the familiar neverending saga of power struggles between Ray and Debra, and Debra and Marie. Another episode features Debra attempting to build closeness by golfing with Ray -- of course, with disatrous results!

The great thing about this series is its ability to make comedy out of everyday life. The Barones never need to look too far for subject matter -- even little things, like the promptness with which Robert and Amy write thank-you notes for their wedding gifts, is enough to set the family's penchant for drama in motion.

This box set also throws in a number of extra, such as bloopers and deleted scenes. Those are always a welcome bonus...but really, this superb series needs nothing extra to attract viewers.",1179792000,,974,4.890909090909091

2761504,5,B000N8UXTW,"The title of the show, ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" says it all -- at least, for my family and me.  But, rcognizing that humor is an individual taste, I suggest you view some of the episodes on television before buying the DVDs.  You can catch the re-runs on most any night of the week on one or more of the stations.  As for us, we have them all and buy them as quickly as they come out.  We have viewed them all at least three times.",1177113600,3,433,4.0588235294117645
