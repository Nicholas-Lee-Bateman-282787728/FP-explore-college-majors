2801307,5,B000OVLMHU,"I'm 21 and even I loved this DVD.  If you liked Jurassic Park, you haven't seen anything yet.  An absolutely fascinating watch for anyone, no matter the age, who has ever had even the slightest interest in prehistoric animals.  Huge round of applause for Animal Planet successfully bridging the gap between entertainment and education.  The cinematography is breath-taking, the acting is surprisingly well done, the facts are not made up by Hollywood, and there's even gory dino battles!  I'm speechless.  Even the hairs on my arm went up.  Yowza.  This DVD is worth every penny and will continue to be a captivating DVD even after Season II premieres. ;)  If you liked this, check out the ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" series from the BBC, as well, and keep a sharp eye for Zoo Tycoon II: Exctinct Animals, if you want to take a stab at running your own digital prehistoric zoo.  Exciting stuff, my friends, exciting stuff.

**On a side note, if you have really young children (under 10 perhaps?) you may want to watch it with them, but Prehistoric Park presents extinct animals just as any nature show would, so keep in mind it's tasteful.",1181865600,57,1136,4.774358974358974
2801308,4,B000OVLMHU,"If you're going to rip something off, you'd better do it right.  This series does.  With almost 6 hours to work with, they can pack more types of creatures into the story than a feature film can, and they can spend more time giving us a glimpse of what it may be like to deal with the day-to-day problems such a unique park would generate.  It's a bit heavy-handed on the preaching of the theory of evolution, but if you believe in that, or can let it bounce right off you if you don't and just enjoy the other aspects of the show, it's quite entertaining.  I'd like to say it's quite educational as well, but I've heard from other sites that the paleontology behind the show may be questionable, so take the purported facts with a grain of salt.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 for the preachiness and for one minor technical flaw:  The CGI employed here seems a little below par when compared to the ""Walking With"" series in one respect.  The computer generated images are nice and sharp when the prehistoric creatures are up close, but then get a bit soft as they get farther from the ""camera"".  This may have been done intentionally to try to give a feeling of depth, but if so it failed miserably.  It could also have been the result of over-compression of the DVD, but I didn't notice any corresponding loss of sharpness on the non-CGI elements of the shots, so I don't think that was the case.",1181606400,9,1401,4.357692307692307
2801309,5,B000OVLMHU,"This is a fabulous, entertaining little series. My sons LOVE them- its kind of Walking With Dinosaurs meets the Crocodile Hunter. Nigel is wonderful, the dinosaurs are well-done, and the pace keeps right on movin'. Put this with Chased By Dinosaurs, and you have a ton of fun. I hope he does more seasons of this! We want to know what happens next, and what animals Nigel will bring back next, at Prehistoric Park!",1181088000,36,414,4.608108108108108
2801310,5,B000OVLMHU,"Imagine the movie ""Jurassic Park"", without all of the unecessary danger and horror, and the ""Walking With"" Trilogy combined and you've got ""Prehistoric Park"". Nigel Marven, star of ""Chased By Dinosaurs"", goes back in time to the time of the dinosaurs to bring them back to the present and try to make them feel comfortable enough to put them in a zoo. With great computer animation and exceptional educational information that brings to light the many mysteries of dinosaurs, ""Prehistoric Park"" will delight the young and old alike.

2801312,4,B000OVLMHU,"It's cheesy but fun. Nigel Marvin is very informative, some of the information is a little dated. Facts and stats special feature doesn't work really well. Worth watching with the entire family and can make you laugh of the storylines they created for the show.",1497830400,,261,4.822222222222222
2801313,5,B000OVLMHU,"This was the best dinosaur movie/docu-drama I have ever seen. I learned more from this one set than from half a dozen others. The cutting edge activation of the times and animals was awesome. Just 5 years ago I thought the computer animation was pretty good. But this new stuff totally brings T-Rex and all his cousins and all their food to LIFE!! It appears there is more but I couldn't find a volume 2, etc. Thanks again to BBC, the first and best in documentaries.",1491436800,,467,4.441860465116279
2801314,2,B000OVLMHU,"Generally we love Nigel Marvin and his creative specials, but for some reason, these ones all seem to include baby animals dying horrible deaths! My kids are actually pretty advanced for their ages as far as film viewing goes, but no one wants to see a baby anything killed, or, after fast-forwarding over that bit, come back to a using its corpse to find the predator, or change programs to find a different baby animal having starved to death and yet another one dying a few minutes later. Yes, Nature is a b*tch, we get it! But even horror films have an unspoken understanding that you don't off the kids. None of my kids, 5-14 years old, enjoyed these. So disappointing.",1490918400,,674,4.578512396694215

2801339,5,B000OVLMHU,"8 year old grandson preferred this BBC production over the Discovery Essential Dinosaur Pack.  Prehistoric Park seemed to spark his imagination and it was exciting for him to see Niles go back in time to save dinosaurs from extinction.  The Discovery DVD is a more scientific, fact based production.  I suspect, for an 8 year old boy, it might be somewhat dry and slow moving.",1443916800,2,376,4.753846153846154

2801344,5,B000OVLMHU,"Very fun adventure that does not take itself too seriously.
Nigel really brings the environments and animals to life. He supplies the magic and charm that makes the show successful. Show spans 6 different type periods and environments. The CGI is not 2015 technology but vastly better than WWD. Best not to figure out how they can create worm holes at will and travel back and fourth. I guess Nigel has the energy output of a Giant Star or Black hole in his bag pack or something?? This is not important. Ground keeper Bob is pretty funny too. Too bad they never were green lighted for a second season but this is big fun for the whole family.
I think I will try out chased by Dinosaurs next.",1435449600,2,692,4.4140625

2801352,4,B000OVLMHU,"This TV series is a good one to have, and I bought this specifically for two children.  The DVDs came in good condition, and there are no problems running it in an older DVD player.  The sound quality is also very good, but there isn't much beyond the episodes, so if you are looking for ""behind the scenes"" or more details about each extinct animals, you won't get this here.

Overall, this is a good DVD and has the entire series BBC produced.  A lot great information packed into it, and good for kids who don't want a more 'fantasy' based learning experience.",1422489600,,563,4.436893203883495

2801363,5,B000OVLMHU,My 4YO son is a dinosaur fanatic.  And his appetite is for the hard science stuff.  Forget the softer Americanized versions -- he wants the BBC versions.  And he is in LOVE with Prehistoric Park.  To the point he can recite the opening lines by heart.  It is a wonderful marriage of scientific facts about the creatures Nigel finds with a storyline that would fire anyone's imagination.

2801376,5,B000OVLMHU,"With so many other reviews of ""Prehistoric Park"", overwhelmingly positive, my comments will be brief.

I watched this with my 5-year old grand-daughter a few months ago, and she couldn't wait to watch all 6 episodes again--and again--and again. I have lost count how many times she has watched Nigel, Bob and Suzanne run their ""unusual"" zoo. When she is not watching it, she likes to play with her toy dinosaurs, pretending that ""Nigel is bringing them back."" Of course sometimes ""Bob"" has to repair a few pens, and ""Suzanne"" has to ""heal"" a few dinosaurs with various wounds and ailments.

I should add that she has been equally transfixed, watching Nigel ""Chased By Dinosaurs."" In both programs the special effects are state-of-the-art. It would be hard to imagine prehistoric animals looking more realistic than this ! Of course I had to explain to my grand-daughter that dinosaurs have been extinct for millions of years, and that she is actually watching the work of some very creative people.

I can only express my delight at how educational and entertaining these discs are. Most kids know what a T-Rex was or a Triceratops. Thanks to Nigel and his team, our 5-year old knows many more. Never mind other kids, you can bet that many adults don't know what a Deinosuchus was--or a Dunkleosteus--or a Megalodon. Our grand-daughter can tell them !

""Prehistoric Park"" and ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" are wonderful for family viewing. I could not recommend them more highly.

There is however one serious concern. My grand-daughter keeps asking me when there will be more ""Prehistoric Park"" adventures ? Nigel--over to you !",1372032000,,1621,4.944852941176471
2801377,5,B000OVLMHU,"There are a lot of Dino DVDs on the market and there is always a chance you might get stuck with a cheesy half-rate production. But Prehistoric Park does not disappoint!

The story, which is told in the style of a documentary, focuses on naturalist Nigel Marven leading missions to find and collect extinct animals from the distant past by use of a time machine. The animals are then placed in the confines of Prehistoric Park, a private wildlife park that is situated in a dry, mountainous region of an unspecified part of the world. Marven's core motivation in the series is to defy extinction and to give select extinct species a second chance at life. A narrator keeps us abreast of each new development as we follow Nigel on his noble quest to save species of prehistoric creatures from extinction! This is a really nice set to have! Entertaining and educational for people of all ages!",1371772800,,891,4.67515923566879

2801380,5,B000OVLMHU,Entertaining and appropriate for children. My son watches it constantly and it never gets old. I'd recommend it for anyone with kids who love dinosaurs.,1368316800,,152,5.12
2801381,5,B000OVLMHU,"The DVDs is great for both Adults and kids. Its set up in  six different continuing episodes, showing these creatures as natiral wild-life. Its jurrasic park meets the Crocidle hunter. In one episode,naturalist Nigel Marven, brings back a Deinosuchus (lived: 70-80 mill, yrs. ago; 5-10 tons,; 30-40 ft.  long), an giant alligator that hunted and ate dinosaurs.
 The show frames itself as a real wild-life perserve with ""unique"" animals, simply brought back from varing time periods. Though there is an aspect of sci-fi time travel, it is a minor detail, allowing Marven to show the science, and aspects of these animals, and the period and geography of where they lived.
I also liked that a vetenarian and game keeper were also involved in caring for these animals, furthering the science and the continuing the story. There are still enough thrills and danger invoved to keep you ointerested whilel you learn something. The effects are seamless and veyi believable, Like whe marven holds a giagantic prehistoric scorpion, from 300 million-years-ago, in his hand.

2801384,5,B000OVLMHU,"My 3 and 5 year old grandsons are crazy about dinosaurs. I met Nigel Marven on a recent cruise to Antarctica.  He provided daily lectures, including videos, to help us enjoy the trip.  He showed a small portion of the video, and I tried to buy it on the ship, but the copies he brought were quickely snapped up.  So I bought it on Amazon. I was at first concerned that my grandkids might get scared, but I explained that it was ""pretend"" and not real.  And they loved it.  I did to. I thought the production team did a really good job of putting the ""real"" and ""pretend"" together.",1361145600,,580,4.236363636363636

The dvd hasn't been available at Netflix for some time now so Amazon was the only way of getting into the house.  Glad I did.",1353024000,,450,4.426829268292683
2801391,5,B000OVLMHU,"If you've seen Walking with Dinosaurs, this show should seem oddly familiar to you.  It's basically a spin-off of the Walking with Dinosaurs spin-off ""Chased By Dinosaurs"".  Yes, this is a spin-off of a spin-off.  Hooray!  So, what is this show like?  Well, if you were expecting a straight up documentary style similar to Walking with Dinosaurs, you'd be out of luck.  If you were expecting a silly documentary where Nigel Marvin time travels to talk about dinosaurs, you'd be closer to this show's concept but still out of luck.

SO, what IS this show?  Well, it's best described as what Jurassic Park would be like if it were made for kids and had a positive tone instead of being a movie where everyone's eaten by dinosaurs.  If you were expecting Nigel to actually tell you a bunch of fact about these creatures documentary-style, you're going to be disappointed because he actually spends very little time doing this.  Really, the show's more about just watching his adventures as he tries to catch and collect various creatures. The premise of the show is that Nigel Marvin goes back in time to collect some dinosaurs (and other extinct prehistoric beasts) in order to put them in some sort of nature preserve in the present.  It's a silly premise because he always goes back to the time period where the thing he's trying to get is already on the verge of extinction, but I don't get why he chooses that time period.  It'd be easier to get like a sabertooth tiger from the time when they are abundant.  What does it matter since 100% of them are extinct now?  I don't know...  Also, the show's a bit laughable because they build the flimsiest fences to keep these giant dinosaurs in, and they frequently break out, but no one ever gets hurt.  So, the premise and execution of the show is a bit silly, but it's a fun show.  I think my favorite character has to be Bob the zookeeper guy.  His Irish accent is awesome, and he's just fun to watch when he gets all flustered when the dinosaurs escape.

I imagine that this show would appeal mostly to children or even older kids, but there's probably not much here for adults.  The premise is a bit too unbelievable and silly for adults to tolerate, and there's just not much by way of animal facts for even nerdy adults like myself to be interested in.  Still, it's a fun show and it'd be a good choice for kids if they have an interest in dinosaurs but need something a bit less violent than most other dinosaur documentaries out there.  This dvd set comes with two discs and six episodes, along with a nice making-of segment where you can see that the whole cast knew the show was silly but had fun anyway.  That's nice.  Anyway, if you have kids or are just in the mood for something light-hearted, you may wish to give Prehistoric Park a try.",1353024000,2,2800,4.509920634920635
2801392,5,B000OVLMHU,"I can't say enough about this set of DVD's. They fascinate, educate and entertain!  They bring alive the prehistoric periods with amazing graphics and intelligent scripts. We bought these for our budding paleontologist grandson, who was eight at the time. He was fascinated and wanted to go visit the park, and even after he knew that the park was not real they have remained a great favorite. They present accurate facts. The retrieved animals are trapped, caged, and cared for by a team of engaging characters.  Nigel is the enthusiastic, intrepid explorer, backed up by a team of experts.  Bob the park engineer is tasked with building enclosures, attending to the animals unique needs and does a great job of humanizing the situations. How do you ensure the Gigantosaurus stay where you want them to? Susan, the veterinarian presents education about the various animal's needs and makes the challenges ""real"".  For instance, how do you get a herd of elephants to accept a mammoth? or how do you get a female Sabre Tooth tiger to accept the male?

These programs are a great favorite of our whole family, have been watched many times and led to many model dinosaur parks and excursions to museums and digs.",1350259200,,1209,4.849514563106796

The paleontology and geology information is good. The host Nigel, is fabulous.  They bring the cool factor, and the danger of catching and dealing with dinosaurs home without any overblown gack and monster truck drama that other dinosaur shows have. The show is pretty much G rated, with one or two scenes you will want to sit with your small child to make sure he/she know Niles will not get himself eaten going too close to the (insert animal here)I wish there were 20 more disks to fuel my sons dinosaur obsession so I would not have to ever watch (and vet and keep him away from) the bad ""terror bird"" style of dinosaur show.

As an adult, I enjoyed the series so much that I wouldn't allow the children to watch the shows through the first time without me.  My only warning is that it plays like a nature show and animals live, die and eat each other in the real world.  As long as that doesn't bother you, I highly recommend this as an entertaining and informative way to bring the past into the present and learn about some of the amazing animals that no longer exist today.",1326672000,,788,4.451388888888889

2801399,5,B000OVLMHU,"""Prehistoric Park"" is a paleontological godsend.  Don't listen to those fussy naysayers that condemn it as an ersatz ""Jurassic Park"" clone.  First of all, the various endangered, ancient beasts are NOT cloned.  They are rescued from perilous time periods by the charismatic and engrossing zoologist and adventurer Nigel Marvin, a somewhat more subdued version of the late, lamented ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin.  Second, not all the captured beasts are dinosaurs and reptiles.  Yes, T-rex makes his obligatory appearance, but we also witness bizarre creatures like a 10-foot carnivorous bird (Phorusracos), a woolly rhino the size of a modern elephant (Elasmotherium), and a 10-foot long millipede (Arthropleura).  Third, the creatures are allowed to and even encouraged to breed, as the Ornithomimus chicks and Smilodon cubs demonstrate.  Finally, not every creature encountered is captured.  For example, we get to see the giant cave bear and the rhinoceros-like Toxodon in their natural environments.

Instead, this series puts a prehistoric (and sometimes gently humorous) twist on the daily activities and challenges in maintaining a natural-habitat wildlife park.  Nigel and his appealing, competent cast, such as groundskeeper Bob and Suzanne the veterinarian provide detailed but fascinating information on the feeding, boarding, and medical care of disparate animal groups.  The actual forays in the past are even more fascinating and gripping as Nigel and his crew deal not only with dangerous, deadly animals but also perilous natural disasters like, say, the approaching asteroid which decimated the dinosaurs during the Cretaceous, and odorless carbon monoxide, and a swamp fire during the Carboniferous period.  Yes, Nigel has a time travel portal to visit those bygone eras, and yes, some people might have a problem with the time travel paradoxes which inevitably follow.  To me, they were an insignificant distraction.  The series seems episodic, but you can't really watch the 3-DVD set at random because there are linear threads running through it.  Two of the main ones are the increasing sibling rivalry between the troublesome T-Rexes Terence and Matilda, and the living adjustments endured by the wounded, long-suffering, and ultimately heroic woolly mammoth Martha.

The series has exciting cliffhangers, but they are natural and unforced. Will Terence survive Matilda's attack? Will Martha heal and be accepted by the elephant herd?  Will the male and female Smilodons breed? Will Nigel get himself and his 4X4 out of the Carboniferous swamp before the fire strikes?  Will Nigel's scorpion sting do permanent damage? Will anything stop the spooked, stampeding titanosaur?  It's also fun to see the depiction of how animals from different eras might react to each other; the CGI in this regard is sensational, and is seamlessly top-notch in general.

Also, in general, if you are a nature, paleontology, or wildlife buff, you will be in heaven with this series. ""Prehistoric Park"" may also give conservation-minded people comfort, of a sort, by kinda cheating extinction and bringing a stunning array of creatures back to life for our contemplation.",1301529600,2,3175,5.480492813141684

It seemed ever so slightly cheesy and the whole Prehistoric Park/Jurassic Park name similarities was also kinda cheesy (to me). But, during the first episode i was interested to watch more and more. In fact i watched most of the series in one sitting.

I think the concern i had before watching it was given the premise of wildlife enthusiasts going back in time to bring dinosaurs to the present wouldn't work but overall it is pretty well done and believable. And that is what makes it work i think, that it is believable and the performances are natural and relate-able. Also, a nice touch is the people aren't 'actors' but professionals in their fields.

A wonderfully imaginative program, clean, no advertising.  Family entertainment in a pure form.  Enjoy.",1206403200,,258,4.7727272727272725
2801437,5,B000OVLMHU,"I can not say enough about how much we have enjoyed this series.  My 4 year old begs me everyday to watch Prehistoric Park when he comes home from school.  And when he's not watching the DVD, he's running around the house pretending to be Nigel and capturing terror birds or mircoraptors.  He found the companion book at his school's book fair, which became a Christmas gift, which he also loves.  And I love that it's so very educational.  Not only is this feeding his interest in dinosaurs, but he has learned tons.  I love that he knows the real scientific names for the animals (it really throws people off when he says his favorite animal is an arthropleura), the time period they lived in and is learning how the earth has changed over time.  He always says that he can't wait for episode 7!",1202428800,,797,4.455172413793103
2801438,5,B000OVLMHU,I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas and she loves it! She is reaaly into dinosaurs and this  video was so well made.,1202428800,,128,4.333333333333333
2801439,5,B000OVLMHU,An excellent series of dinosaur adventure stories...the T.V. version of the Jurassic Park trillogy.  I strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys dinosaur flicks.,1201478400,,159,5.913043478260869
2801440,5,B000OVLMHU,The boys (3yr.s & 6yr.s) love the DVD.  Great for long road trip.  Good dinosaurs and lots of action.,1200873600,,101,4.2631578947368425
2801441,5,B000OVLMHU,"Within this collection is six episodes on two discs about Nigel Marven going back in time and bringing back prehistoric animals for a park in the 21st Century.  I really enjoyed how the technology and methods used to make the Walking with... series have been used to help this adventure in time and space.  I am also happy that animals besides dinosaurs were selected to help fill the park.  Evolution, the changing environment, the social needs of some of the animals were all touched on and are important issues when dealing with such a wide range of animals, prehistoric or otherwise.",1200268800,,587,4.792079207920792
2801442,5,B000OVLMHU,"I had reservations about the idea of a Prehistoric Dino Park. It seemed a bit daft. however it's the same people that did the 'Walking With...' and the 'Chased by...' series which I loved, so I gave it a go.
They tread a very fine line between science fact and utter fantasy, but they do it with style and wit. The observation of the 'animals' in their habitats is very well done, imitating the style of wildlife documentaries to a tee. Then there is the boys-own-adventure element of trapping the beasts and keeping them, which surprisingly does tell us useful information about them and is also very entertaining.
If you love Dinos then this is for you. Nuff said.",1195171200,5,666,4.605042016806722
2801443,5,B000OVLMHU,"A great six-episode series featuring Chased by Dinosaur's Nigel Marvin.  This series combines the Chased by Dinosaurs time-travel premise with the premise of Jurassic Park.  Nigel travels back to various points in prehistory to rescue extinct animals and bring them back to the present, to ""Prehistoric Park"".

Of course, you have to ignore the fact that a few individuals do not constitute a viable breeding population, not to mention the fact that the ""time gate"" consists of two stick-like instruments which Nigel just turns on and sticks into the ground to create a ""doorway"".  But if you can suspend your disbelief, this show is great fun.

Of all the things my 4 and 6 year old daughters like to watch (over and over and over and over), this is by far one of the most bearable for Mommy.  Highly recommended, we watch it almost every night.",1193702400,31,846,4.760273972602739
2801444,5,B000OVLMHU,"I purchased Prehistoric Park for my son's sixth birthday, and it was an absolute hit.  The dinosaurs are convincing, the stories have enough suspense to keep us watching, and there is even a bit of real wildlife biology thrown in for painless educational value.  The show reminds me of a cross between Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom and Nature, with great dinosaurs and time travel thrown in for kid (and grown-up) appeal. The Time Portal is awesome, though my nine-year-old kept suggesting ways it could be improved to make it more efficient.  At first the blue-screen effects are kind of obvious, but your kids won't care, and soon neither will you. Recommended.",1193443200,3,664,4.910714285714286
2801445,5,B000OVLMHU,What can be done with computer graphics today blows the mind.  I love this guy and his work.,1191283200,,92,4.111111111111111
2801446,5,B000OVLMHU,"Our family loved this series so much that I HAD to pre-order so I could get it as soon as possible.  Quality of DVD etc is excellent (If you take the box apart you will discover a map of Prehistoric Park lining the box set sleeve.  An odd touch for a part of the box that would normally never ever be seen, I just happened to be cutting it apart.)  Quality of the shows, even better.

The paleontology is all intelligent guesses but they are not bad guesses.  The animation puppetry etc are just as fine as in the origional ""Walking With Dinosaurs"".  And then there is the fun with Nigel Marvin!  He is a real naturalist who can be seen on Animal Planet, and with every hare-brained capture for the Park, my Mum and I would say, ""That is just what Nigel would really do!""  He has his 'film crew' with him and some of the footage purports to be of their eye-view adventures, such as a shot of Nigel in a tree talking to whomever is holding the camera, or a shot suddenly going wild as an animal charges and the crewman drops the camera and scrambles for safety.  This technique to add authenticity is a bit overdone by the ""Walking With"" people in their shows but is strangely more realistic where Nigel is involved.

Some of the series involves not the captures but settling in the new inhabitents of the Prehistoric Park.  These bits are sometimes the best although the humour involving the beleagured park manager Bob is a little much.  But then, in zoos and parks world-wide the keepers find themselves in humourous situations because animals are just like that.

If you like this one, check out it's predecessor, ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" which is Nigel Marvin visiting the past and trying to study animals without being eaten.  Which again is just what he'd do in a heartbeat if given the chance.",1186963200,14,1797,4.489230769230769
2801447,5,B000OVLMHU,Great family fun. My 10 yo son is not and hasn't ever been a dinosaur fan. But this show brings them to life and brought to life his interest in the subject.,1186444800,,157,3.9375
2801448,5,B000OVLMHU,"This video will amaze the whole family with cutting edge graphics and an entertaining story to match. Nigel, the host, is somewhat like the famous Crocodile Hunter but in the circumstances of this video documentary he rescuing dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasts. This is what Jurassic Park should have been... Nigel is making a zoo for these animals and the video documents the trials and tribulations of finding, capturing, transporting (in time), housing/caging and tending to the animals. Who doesn't want to see that?!? Your dino&beast-loving kids will be entertained for weeks (as they watch the video over and over again), and what's more, you will find yourself oftentimes watching it along side them (over and over again). Simply put, this is what family entertainment was meant to be.",1186272000,2,797,5.186046511627907
2801449,5,B000OVLMHU,"My 5 1/2 year old already loved dinosaurs. Now she is over the moon about microraptors and saber tooth cats and quite knowledgeable to boot!  She's giving tours of the dinosaur section at the library having now checked out pretty much every book they have on the subject.  This is the one DVD series that my husband and I don't mind viewing a few zillion times.  I'm totally amazed at how realistic and ""Animal Planet-esque"" they have made this show. Really hope they make more.",1186012800,4,478,4.6
2801450,5,B000OVLMHU,This show is great. I am a Science Fiction fan and watch shows about animals and this show combines both. Cant wait to see when new shows start again.,1184457600,,150,4.206896551724138

8186923,5,B000OVLMHU,"Great entertainment for the entire family! BBC does wonderful work in creating realistic prehistoric life, integrating Nigel's pursuit to create a unique wildlife park utilizing a time travel portal into earth's distant past. Touching scenes of a mother saber-tooth lion struggling to care for her cubs in a changing environment. Memorable scenes of Parasaurolophus herd heading along the brilliant white sand beaches of ancient Texas.
Nigel explores the ancient coal forests of 300 million years ago searching for giant dragonflies, and herbivorous millipedes which are over 3 meters long existing in an atmosphere 3 times richer in oxygen than modern day.
Lots of giant dinosaurs and beasties in this creative dvd! Well done!",1519257600,,727,5.442477876106195
