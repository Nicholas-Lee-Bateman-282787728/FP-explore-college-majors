8656173,4,B00K62XVAI,"nteresting, if slow building, documentary on Stuart Hall, one of England's leading leftist thinkers of the last 40 years.

The film eschews some of the usual tropes of bio-docs, using no new talking heads interviews, but only clips from Hall's various TV and radio appearances over the years, along with old film clips of the eras being discussed, close shots of magazines, and some very poetic (I assume) newly shot footage of skylines and people. The music is mostly Miles Davis, who is Hall's favorite musician, although it really adds more emotion to the film when later on Akomfrah switches tactics and uses more music by a film composer and others as well, including Brian Eno.

For those of us who know little about Hall, the film can be frustrating for a while, because it recounts a lot of biographical details without getting into exactly what it is that Hall espouses or believes, or why he was/is so important to the left or UK culture. But over time the film starts to dig deeper, and it's hard not to be struck by Hall's thoughtful, powerful but non- didactic views. After listening to screaming partisan talking heads on American television it's wonderful to listen to someone who injects such civility and thoughtfulness into presenting his views, and never seems to resort to simplistic answers or blame. He also acknowledges and embraces how his views and perceptions have continued to evolve over the decades as the world around him continues to change. Would that we had more such people speaking on both sides of the political spectrum.",1408752000,,1557,4.871698113207547
