5189475,5,B008XJ0IWK,We bought this right before Christmas so our granddaughter would have something to watch on our trip to Florida. She loved it!,1368057600,,126,4.7727272727272725

5189477,3,B008XJ0IWK,I liked the Christmas Bunny and found the Littlest Angel charming and a little corny because of the old fashioned action.  I watched this movie when I was a little kid.  The other 2 were awful and if I could delete them from the diswc I would.,1359504000,,243,4.148936170212766
5189478,4,B008XJ0IWK,"Good movie, great price, simple to order, got it earlier than promised. Good experience overall.
Five more words to post?",1358899200,,121,5.1
5189479,5,B008XJ0IWK,Was the right price at the time I bought it & came with 3 other movies when I only wanted the Christmas Bunny.,1358294400,,110,3.8260869565217392
5189480,2,B008XJ0IWK,I thought it his was a animated story narrated by Florence Henderson. It was a story of an abused girl in foster care. This was not suitable for my grandchildren which are 5&1.i watched it prior to sending it and wasn't able to give as a gift. Subject matter was too old for this age group.,1356652800,,290,4.196428571428571
5189481,2,B008XJ0IWK,"This movie pack was a disappointment.  Christmas Bunny was dramatic, uncertain, not much fun for children.  The child at the center of this story has severe emotional issues.
The cover photo for The Nativity has no relationship to the film by that name in this pack. The film is black/white, very dark, poor lighting.  It would not hold the attention of an adult, might be frightening for a small child.  If time allows, we may take a look at the other two films.  No likely.",1355443200,5,475,4.541176470588235
5189482,1,B008XJ0IWK,It is not as advertised.  The Christmas bunny and The Littlest Angel are NOT on the DVD.  This is extremely disappointing for my children.,1449792000,2,138,4.708333333333333

5189486,1,B008XJ0IWK,I bought this for my 4 year old and regret it. I thought it would have nice christmas stories for kids in stead it has black and white stories from 100 years ago and a story about a rabbit do no recommend,1424908800,,204,3.880952380952381

5189490,4,B008XJ0IWK,"I had purchased ""The Christmas Bunny"" movie in 2013 for a couple of families and they enjoyed it very much, so this year I purchased it for a few more.  It's an enlightening movie about a little girl who was put into the foster care system due to her mother's involvement with drugs (all of which is handled in a ""safe for the whole family to view"" way).  The heartwarming part starts when the little girl, who ""escapes"" her circumstances via watching a video of the Velveteen Rabbit, crosses paths with an actual rabbit.  The movie actually has a good Christian message and is well acted.  The title suggests mushy or mystical, but it is neither of those things.  Florence Henderson does a superb job of playing a curmudgeonly ""rabbit lady"" who helps heal not only the rabbit, but the little girl's heart. I love the naturalness of the foster family's son and the actor who played the veteranarian.  The reason I gave this particular dvd only four stars is because of ""The Nativity"" play movie part of it.  THAT was poorly acted, and the man who played Joseph sounded sickly and whimpy. The Littlest Angel I remember from my childhood.  I hadn't watched the last video on the dvd yet, but the premise of the Nativity story being told by the innkeeper, etc. is intriguing.",1420502400,3,1272,4.597345132743363
5189491,5,B008XJ0IWK,I purchased this for the Christmas Bunny movie only and have seen it several times.  It's something I watch every year during the holiday season.  The other movies did not appeal to my taste.,1419379200,,191,4.588235294117647
5189492,4,B008XJ0IWK,"I am only here to clear up a few things. Like many suggested, my main target in buying this was for the Christmas bunny, I have not watched the other 3 yet. I wanted to post here right away to clear up something false:

""It's dual sided and on a plan DVD disk. When you put it in to play a Christmas Bunny your chances are 50% it's in right. ""

With the comments of the advertising, this comment alone almost put me off from buying it, since I do not want to watch the advertisements (this is correct btw, the advertisements are annoying) only to it be on the wrong side to watch it again. It is on a double sided disk but near the center of the DVD it tells you the two titles near the center in small print. So whatever side you want to watch you need those titles to show face up. So to watch the Christmas bunny, be sure ""the Christmas bunny/littlest angel"" is face up when you put it in the player.",1418774400,3,903,4.039106145251397
5189493,5,B008XJ0IWK,These were a gift for my aunt and she was very pleased.,1418515200,,55,3.6666666666666665

5189495,5,B008XJ0IWK,Much of this movie was made where we live. Bought it for the grandkids but it's very entertaining and enjoyable for all.,1409961600,,120,4.5
5189496,5,B008XJ0IWK,Bought this to use when my young family comes to visit.  They love it. It has a great assortment of movies.,1395446400,,107,4.095238095238095
5189497,3,B008XJ0IWK,"It's dual sided and on a plan DVD disk.  When you put it in to play a Christmas Bunny your chances are 50% it's in right.  When you get it in right, then have to flip thru menus and other stuff to get to the movie itself.  The Christmas Bunny movie itself is great.  The other three are old and bad video perception.  Next time would opt for a dvd of only the Christmas Bunny movie and no others on it.",1394755200,,402,3.9135802469135803
5189498,5,B008XJ0IWK,"I bought this DVD for my neighbor.  She loves it - said it's one of her favorite Christmas movies.  She said Florence Henderson was awesome, as well as the young lady who plays the main character.",1393113600,,196,4.416666666666667
5189499,5,B008XJ0IWK,Saw it on tv. My grandson liked it so I bought 2. One for his house and one for mine.,1392854400,,85,3.3
5189500,5,B008XJ0IWK,"The 1st movie is really great--The Christmas Bunny is about an adopted girl whose emotions come alive at the presence of a bunny that was shot with a bb gun  in the backyard by the family,s 2 brothers. The Bunny is brought to a vet and the story comes alive. A true family adventure with no violence,sex or profanity but with the right amount of drama. In fact the bunny on this show look,s like one of my 3 house bunnies that roam my house,---The other 3 movies on this 4 pack are really dated and (sorry Lord)were totally lame by nearly anyone,s standard.",1390608000,,557,4.355769230769231

There are only 2 movies on it, they're black and white, and they're not the movies that I bought the DVD for.  I'm very disappointed.  Don't bother to buy this!",1510704000,,275,4.230769230769231
8532185,3,B008XJ0IWK,Our grandchildren loved the Christmas Bunny.  The rest of the DVD would not play.  It was so disappointing for them.,1488067200,,116,4.75

8532187,5,B008XJ0IWK,Christmas Bunny was a great film but the others not so much. Worth buying just for the bunny.,1486080000,,93,4.222222222222222

8532191,5,B008XJ0IWK,"I saw The Littlest Angel the year it came out, and I was about 11. It really had a big effect on me, and that's all I remember. I've always wanted to see it again, and when I found this quad dvd, I thought it would be a good Christmas video for the grandkids, especially with two that actually cover the nativity. I'm really happy with the buy, and the kids love it, too. There was a lot I had forgotten about the Littlest Angel. A lot of singing (I was really amazed at how well all the actors could sing!) and some corny stuff, and a ""made for tv special"" type of filming and props. But the whole intent of the movie was very moving still, after all these years. I got a lump in my throat at the end, and now know why it brought tears to my eyes, even as a pre-teen kid. Very good buy, I'd say.",1453852800,,796,3.950310559006211
