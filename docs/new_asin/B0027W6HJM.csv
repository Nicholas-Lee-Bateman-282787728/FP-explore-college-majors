8355192,4,B0027W6HJM,"Great little snack bag for my daughter for preschool ! But not much more. It is certainly not big enough for a whole lunch. But great for a small juice box, and snack baggie . Or maybe just putting small toys in. The only issue I have had with this is the zipper gets stuck pretty often which is frustrating for my daughter. So it is a bit cheaply made, but worth it for the movies inside.",1416182400,,389,4.064935064935065
8355193,5,B0027W6HJM,Daughter loved this! Loves the movies and loves the lunch bag! She's had them for a few years now and the bag is still in great shape! We are very pleased with this purchase!,1380499200,,174,4.147058823529412
8355194,4,B0027W6HJM,"Very cute box. It is made out of cloth material. It is small not really a lunch box but big enough for a child to carry small toys. (mine will most likely put her pet shops or Tinkerbell toys) It did come with three DVDs which I was nervous about after seeing the size of the bag but the DVDs run from 1hr to an 1hr and a half. Overall it is a cute box (bag) whichever, but my 5yr old will be pleased.",1346457600,,401,3.7857142857142856
8355195,3,B0027W6HJM,"The usual care bears stories of teaching values.  The graphics were not as good as the newer dvd's.  Old school graphics which might still appeal to kids.  Dont expect much from the lunch bag it came with, it is just big enough to hold the 3 dvds.",1319760000,2,247,4.212765957446808
