2922064,5,B000UI9CG0,"This was one of the first video's I used when I first started doing Pilates, the results were instantaneous. This video is amazing if you enjoy Pilates like I do, then do this every morning to start your day and you will notice results immediately. Its quick and you will feel refreshed and ready for your day.",1357084800,2,310,4.456140350877193
2922065,5,B000UI9CG0,"This pilates DVD by Mari Winsor is one of the best I have used.  I owned it previously but my daughter ""confiscated"" it when she moved.  This is a replacement since I just had to have it.  Amazing what 20 minutes can do.  You do have to have some knowledge of her technique but even if you don't, you soon will have it by the 2nd workout. There is no serious lag in between sets and the pace is fairly brisk (which I like).  You see real results with this video pretty quickly to say nothing of your improved posture and strengthened core. I alternate between treadmill and this pilates workout and get fantastic results. I know I need to add a few sessions of weight training to this routine ... someday.",1314748800,17,705,4.3106060606060606
