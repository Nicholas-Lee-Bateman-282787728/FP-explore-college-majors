6039301,5,B00FYPEEFS,"This has been categorized as a ""chick flick.""  I really disagree.  It was a true love story.  It was slightly unusual which gave the movie great character.  The best one-word description is unique.  N.  Cage is one of my personal favorites.  Meg Ryan is cute as ever and a great  mate to this angel.  Dennis Franz did a fine job as another angel in this  film.  The ending was sad but touching.  I rank this movie right up there  with another of my favorites, Ghost.",912816000,,466,4.341176470588235

6039303,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I saw City of Angels for the first time in the theatres, and I couldn't stop crying, which to me is a good indication of how awesome the movie is. I love Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, but together, they're even better! The  story may sound weak if you just hear what it's about, but once you see the  actual movie, believe me, it's SO good! The soundtrack to this movie is  incredible as well, as an added bonus.",911865600,,409,4.151898734177215
6039304,3,B00FYPEEFS,"I really don't remember why I bought this back in 2009.  When I first saw this movie when I was younger I thought it was pretty cool, an interesting interpretation of angels and an unconventional romance.  Then an interesting plot, I don't want to spoil the ending.  But there was a strong character-driven aspect to it and I can appreciate that.

But these days it's kinda corny.  I don't think I could watch it now even for nostalgia purposes.  But maybe you'll like it.",1527552000,,472,4.559523809523809

6039333,5,B00FYPEEFS,"This movie has one of the best love scenes in all of cinema. Spoiler warning.  The scene consists of Dennis Franz and Meg Ryan, but they don't kiss or anything. Dennis Franz is a patient about to have surgery and Meg Ryan is his doctor. Meg Ryan sees a tattoo of a woman on Dennis Franz's arm and says with disapproval, ""What does your wife think of that?"" Then, with an expression of joy and pride, Franz says, ""That is my wife."" At which, Ryan and Wanda-Lee Evans, the actress playing the nurse, react with amusement and approval.
I call this a ""love scene"" because Franz with one line communicates what love is all about.. two people who support, share, and enjoy each other.
The rest of the movie has some interesting theological concepts that are entertaining and thought provoking, but it is this one scene that makes this an incredible film in my eyes.",1516406400,,859,4.541935483870968

Was feeling nostalgic, now I remember why I loved it so much and why I felt like I needed to watch this again. The way he pined for her. His tenderness, the way he touched her.

6039378,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I've loved this sensitive film since it was first released. The premise is a little bit weird, and I'm not sure if angels actually sit up on top of skyscrapers, or stand on the beach in the morning, but the movie has heart. Just one of those ""good cry films"". Everybody needs one once in awhile. Nicolas Cage and  Meg Ryan make the film, and Dennis Franz makes the laughs...a sweet-sided tough guy full of wisdom.

6039388,5,B00FYPEEFS,Excellent movie,1480982400,,15,7.0
6039389,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Released in 1998 and directed by Brad Silberling, City of Angels is a drama/fantasy/romance starring Nicolas Cage as a literal angel in Los Angeles named Seth whos assigned to bring the dead to God. During one of his assignments he meets and becomes intrigued by a doctor (Meg Ryan) and wonders what it would like to be human. Andre Braugher is on hand as Seths angel friend while Dennis Franz plays a human in whom Seth seems to have an affinity. Will Seth fall to the earth?

I saw this when I was younger and it didn't have much of an impact, although I liked it. Viewing it at an older age definitely heightened my appreciation and shows that this is a movie for mature people (regardless of what age). It skillfully touches on heavy issues of which younger people don't particularly dwell. Written by Dana Stevens and based on the 1987 film Wings of Desire, everything depends on if the film can convince the viewer that the angels are real and believable in the context of the story. It does so convincingly with a tone similar to Meet Joe Black, which was released (later) the same year as City of Angels; and maybe 1990s Ghost. If you like these two movies you will definitely appreciate City.

I don't want to say anything more because its better that you watch the movie and discover its potential riches for yourself. The script is well thought out, although they didn't milk the ending for all its potential, plus it seemed rather rushed, not to mention there are some theological holes. Regardless, this is a nigh spiritual masterpeace. (No, I didn't misspell that).

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Malibu, Big Bear Lake, Lake Tahoe and the San Francisco Public Library, California.

6039401,4,B00FYPEEFS,"I like this movie for all the reasons other's have mentioned.  It is based however on a wonderful movie ""Wings of Desire"".  I add the review of this older version - SUPERB, here.  (I don't agree with this reviewer of City of Angels of his opinion that it is not a good movie).  Both movies are valid but the orinal is SUPERB!!!

This weeks movie, City of Angels is an American remake of Wings of Desire, a German movie by director Wim Wenders. Wings of Desire is great. City of Angels is not. Its weird how you can take a subtle, black and white art film from Europe that unobtrusively examines the meaning of life and the value of love, put Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan in it, make it a cheesy chick flick, give it a Goo Goo Dolls soundtrack, and for some reason it doesnt hold up. All the pieces were there, you know? Weird. A rare miss, Hollywood Remakes Department.

Admittedly, though, it has been a really long time since I actually saw Wings of Desire, and I am almost positive that some of the things that are hilarious in City of Angels come directly from the original. But for the sake of this argument, I am treating City of Angels as if it is an entirely original production, so keep your comparative cinema notes for your graduate seminar on the semiotics of post-Weimar neorealism, or whatever.",1476316800,,1305,4.416666666666667

6039584,4,B00FYPEEFS,"City Of Angels is a movie that is steeped both in ProtoBiology and in Christianity, which of course have an innate tension between them.  For this reviewer, this internal dynamic is critical to City Of Angels rather than the concepts of ""Angels"" and ""Eternal Life"".  In this move the concepts of Free Will and the primacy of human experiences of ""Warmth"", ""Touch"", and ""Human Experience"" are emphasized.  The real life Meg Ryan and the fictional Dr. Maggie Rice, Cardiac Surgeon, are ""Doublegangers""- a psychological term that means that behind each is the shadow of the other.  There is a side of the romantic Meg Ryan that is the practical and clear thinking Cardiac Surgeon. There is a side of Dr. Maggie Rice that is longing for deep romantic and spiritual love as well as intimacy.
The Angel Seth, the Nicolas Cage character is hanging around ""Los Angeles County Hospital"" -actually reality Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena-and falls deeply in love the ""Maggie"".  As an ex-Angel, Nathaniel Messenger, tells him:  ""He gave these bozos the greatest gift in the entire world-Free Will.  You think that he didn't give it to us as well?  You just jump, take the dive off a bridge or out of a window.  You just do it!!

Even for us, the living and real people, how many of us have the courage to ""Jump from the life that has been planned out for us by our parents and our society into something more fulfilling, more rooted in the realities of actual life?  The critical issue this movie raises is not, ""Life after Death"".  The Critical is ""Authentically living out whom we actually are while we are still alive.""",1429660800,4,1620,4.725978647686833

6039618,4,B00FYPEEFS,"Welcome to Amazon, a jungle in which one sometimes finds movie reviews that are better written than scripts. It is a re-make. But it's not half bad.

Cage does the best he can with the script. He ""falls"" from grace for a mortal woman. In the course of so doing, he becomes mortal, but it is not a punishment, it is an experience he chose, exercising his free will. Cage's character is not unlike that of Starman, he is essentially a light being in a holographic body that cannot experience any sensory perception, because there is nothing ""in"" the body, no blood, no hormones. It is an ascended soul wearing a ""human"" costume.

The angel then, is the watcher who is also the man in black. He can see everything, hear everything, but only as a watcher, he cannot interact, be seen, be heard, it is a one-way street. He is ""big"" brother but in the form of countless individual angels. Few humans notice angels at all, even though ""there is one in every room."" Yet no angel can interfere with free will. ""Fallen angels"" play by the same rules but have more of them and keep their angel memories.

Even those who can see angels and feel their touch might not care what the angel feels. ""Maggie"" does.
It is the mutuality of interaction that makes the experience meaningful for humans. Humans feel what they expect to feel. At the same time, ""Maggie"" is the human who wants to ascend. She is cherubic looking. She is selfless. She is ready to be rid of the messy bloody noisy smelly putrid business of sewing up broken hearts that refuse to mend. She is curious to see where they go, perhaps. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

Is a moment of love, a few hours of romance worth a dimension shift? Many have said it not only is, but that love is the driving force in the universe. Without love, nothing would move. So some go up, some go down. For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The funny thing about love being a driving force is that it has to keep moving. There is no tying it up to a tree, putting in a cage. Even one called Nicolas.

These two souls were attracted to one another not because they ""fit"" as romantic partners but because they were alike, both curious, both ready to sacrifice everything they know to learn everything they don't know. True love is often a passing of like-souls in the hallway, so to speak. Seth does not get into the elevator, he waits for Maggie outside, a step ahead, during the courtship. Perhaps he does not want to see her choice of destinations.

The interesting difference here is the idea that angelic beings are incapable of feeling emotion, of tasting food, of enjoying sensual touch. That they hang around us in order to figure out what makes us tick. ""Seth"" asks ""Maggie"" what tears are, what makes the body cry. Is it a purely physical reaction? How does it work? He gets the technical explanation, he looks into the microscope, but some piece is missing. In the end, he becomes fully ""human"" by crying then grieving, then finding joy in renewal by loving little things, the pounding surf hitting the body swimming just in front of a wave.

And so do we all, moving in cycles from observer to participant and back again in the seasons of life and of lifetimes.",1421884800,7,3251,4.462962962962963

Surprisingly, Nic Cage is extraordinary in this.  Meg Ryan is a very sweet love interest but Cage carries the show.  The idea is there are angels everywhere and they can become human (it's called falling).  Cage is one of them and comes across Meg - she is a doctor and while performing surgery her patient dies on the table.  Cage is there to act as the guide for the patient, and Cage becomes fascinated by Ryan.  Beyond that I won't go but it's a moving, thoughtful movie that I enjoyed a great deal, agnostic though I am.

6039670,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I was surprised how much I liked this movie. Some might consider this to be solely a ""chick flick"" and it certainly qualifies as that, but for pure entertainment it rises above most films in that loosely-defined genre and is more than suitable for guys too (note to males: this is a great date movie.) The film is an exploration of love and how far you'd go for true love even if the opportunity is fleeting. Nicolas Cage is Seth, an angel, who falls in love with a human, Maggie (Meg Ryan,) a heart surgeon with much angst and conflict in her personal life. The film opens with a genuinely gut-wrenching scene that sets the characters in play and establishes the premise that angels are everywhere protecting people when they least expect it and helping them to the afterlife when they die (watch for the exceptionally skillfully directed convenience store robbery scene.) I liked the stylistic choice of having the angels wearing black trench coats, which I found to be odd but effective.

I was slightly tempted to dock the film a star for a couple of minor issues: first, the concept of a heart surgeon being in life-shattering despair after losing a patient through no fault of her own seems a bit unrealistic (though it's a required plotpoint;) second, Seth is occasionally borderline creepy as he virtually stalks Maggie at some points which lacked the nuance and subtlety that were more common in most of the film; and third, the resolution at the end of the film is both predictable and highly inconceivable. Despite these quibbles, I elected to give the film a five star rating largely on the basis of the performances, with standout supporting performances by Dennis Franz as the appropriately named Nathaniel Messinger, who is not what he seems, and the great Andre Braugher as Seth's friend and fellow angel in a standout role. (As a cautionary aside, I did not need to see Dennis Franz skinny dipping.)

Thematically there's a lot going on here and the pros far outweigh the cons. I liked the ""Moveable Feast"" references, which made for some great scenes as Maggie pursues Seth (and vice versa,) and particularly relished way director Brad Silberling dealt with questions of reality, love, and the concept that some things are true whether you believe in them or not. This is far from my standard viewing fare, but it was highly recommended to me and now I'm passing on the favor to you. The DVD comes with tons of extras, so if you liked the film there is plenty more to ponder if you flip the disc over.",1405900800,,2519,4.6968325791855206

6039673,3,B00FYPEEFS,"This is story of fallen Angel loving one doctor on earth ! I do not understand why other angels did not get such inspiration.
There is nothing spiritual about the movie just a total new concept. No problems with the acting . Everything is fine but the story is not digested by me and my mind have ejected the concept in this movie. I thought I will find many Angels in this movie but ultimately found romantic one fallen Angel running after a lady- that's not a Angel at all!
The name of the movie will be better suite "" Love of Angel"" instead ""City of Angel""
If you are very young at heart and hunger for romance go for it but if you are serious about Angels,they are not, they are fake!",1405641600,,688,4.180451127819549

6039695,4,B00FYPEEFS,"A sweet meditation on the preciousness of life and love. And you gotta love the premise:  an angel falls in love with a human, and becomes human in order to be with her.  Unfortunately, things kind of go downhill from there for the ""fallen angel"".  Years ago, I saw ""Wings of Desire"", the German-made original, and I actually prefer it to the American version.  Nevertheless, this is a good movie, with some funny bits here and there (especially from Dennis Franz).",1399766400,,465,4.703703703703703
6039696,4,B00FYPEEFS,"As she reads 105 degrees on the thermometer she's just taken out of her six-year old daughter's mouth - we hear Mum's panicking thoughts - pleading for help from a higher power. ""I don't really pray...but if you could help out here..."" she says in escalating dread. Yet her child Susan doesn't seem fazed - staring instead at a man in a long black coat with a peaceful face on the other side of the room that Mummy doesn't seem able to see.

His name is Seth - and next thing he's walking alongside Susan who's lying in her pyjamas on a hospital gurney looking up at him as a group of doctors and surgeons try to get her to the operating room on time. Moments later Seth and tiny Susan are looking in at the medical commotion through the glass outside - holding hands as they watch an unresponsive child's body and a mother breaking down in agony. Susan looks up and asks Seth - ""She won't understand?"" He calmly replies - ""She will...someday...""

Inside hot cars motionless on a log-jammed freeway - we see the citizens of LA and hear their thoughts about doomed love affairs (""he's never gonna leave her...""), work worries and how everything takes twenty minutes in Los Angeles. We then witness more angels in human form at work - one listening to the thoughts of a mother proud that her daughter has had a 6lb 4oz baby and become a parent too - helping an air-traffic controller concentrate when his debt problems almost distract him from Flight Federal 595 - and two working a kid and a scared liquor store owner on opposite sides of the counter - urging them both to 'stay cool' as the jumpy young man nervously robs his till with a gun.

These angels aren't flashy - they don't have wings nor halos - they don't stop bullets or avert car crashes - they remain invisible to the human world and only lay on hands to help and sooth. They ponder what their charges say about life - usually from a height - dangling their legs over skyscraper girders, aeroplane wings, 100-foot high cowboy adverts for cigarettes and the Hollywood Sign. They also gather on the beach each morning (without leaving footprints in the sand) to witness the sunrise and hear the music of possibility...as a new day begins...

As you can imagine a reworking of Wim Wender's beloved 1987 classic movie ""Wings Of Desire"" by Hollywood types was always going to be open to ridicule and charges of crass commercialism - but 1998's ""City Of Angels"" pulled off the transition with a genuine deftness of touch - producing a movie that moved many movie goers far more than they thought it would. The brilliant Dana Stevens adapted screenplay smartly keeps it about people - about finding humanity - the joy in everyday occurrences - and knowing there is always love in your life in one form or another.

Principal in pulling this off is the spot-on casting of Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Cage plays Seth - an Angel who is more than curious about what it would be like to actually 'feel' let alone be human - while the talented Meg Ryan plays Doctor Maggie Race - a Thoracic Surgeon in L.A.'s Mission Hospital who is having a crisis of faith after losing a 50-year old patient called Tom Bradford on her table in what was a routine bypass.

Dr. Maggie suddenly feels no longer in control and can't shake off the stricken reaction of Bradford's family as she broke the news to them. She did it with a little too much of that scalpel-like precision and detachment that works so well in the operating theatre but not in the real world - cockily playing Jimi Hendrix as she dabbles with someone else's heart. It was a textbook operation - yet it went wrong - her patient's fading arrhythmia literally in her hands - powerless to stop him from dying (dialogue above). But her partner and fellow surgeon Jordan Ferris (a suave Colm Feore) thinks that Maggie is not out of sorts nor crazy nor chemically imbalanced - just tired - and with a little rest - she should just ""come back to work on Monday and get back on the saddle"". But Maggie doesn't seem able to get that confidence nor that belief back.

Then one night - tired and still trying to figure out why an abandoned male infant on the 4th floor keeps crying all the time (her Doctor friend Anne is played by the lovely Robin Bartlett) - Maggie exits the lift at the 6th floor by mistake and sees a man standing outside a ward bedroom. He turns around and it's the beautiful Seth.  They engage in small talk about the benefits of visiting hours and being in despair on the stairwell  - and a flame of attraction is lit between them. His eyes haunt her and she wonders how he knew her first name when her ID tag only displays the initial 'M'?

They meet again in the heavenly upward concrete circles of the city library as she returns a book - Hemmingway's ""A Moveable Feast - Sketches On The Author's Life In Paris In the Twenties"". More feelings grow as Seth sexily explains about the great American author's skill at describing the senses of taste and touch (things he can't experience himself but longs to). At this point Maggie thinks Seth's a bit weird - with his cryptic replies and always wearing the same clothes whilst saying he's not a bike courier but a Messenger of God. But something inside her aches for him - like a lost Soul moving towards its mate.

Seth tries to discuss his growing feelings with another celestial body - Cassiel (the wonderful Andre Braugher) but Cassiel seems sceptical. Then one afternoon Seth meets the rotund hedonist Nathaniel Messinger (superb casting in Dennis Franz) in the heart ward munching down on yet another tub of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Nathaniel can hear and feel Seth's presence - and Seth soon works out that Nathaniel was once an angel too - but one who fell in love with a woman on Earth and 'chose' to fall to be with her (nice work from Joanna Merlin). Over more food Nathaniel explains that he gave up his power to travel at the speed of thought - never grow old and never feel any pain - for love - and hasn't regretted a day since.

And on it goes to Maggie working out why the child keeps crying and what her strange man in black really is (from a photo) and finally to a decision that Seth must make of his own 'free will'...

Director Brad Silberling's movie cleverly avoids any flashy 'ghost' or 'angel' tricks and allied with Gabriel Yared's truly gorgeous film score (the acoustic ""The Unfeeling Kiss"" used during the market scene as they shop for fruit is particularly stunning) and other clever song choices by Peter Gabriel, Paula Cole, Alanis Morissette and Sarah McLachlan - gives his angelic messengers a calming presence - benevolent beings watching over us all but not interfering nor judging.

The February 2014 AMERICAN BLU RAY I bought on Barcode 883929374298 is REGION FREE so there are no compatibility problems for UK or European buyers. The picture is defaulted to 2.4:1 Aspect Ratio so there's bars top and bottom - but even stretched to Full Screen - the print quality is lovely throughout. You wouldn't say it was exceptional by any means - but I feel its an improvement over the DVD I had  - never overly glossy - classy in its presentation. Eyes are blue - sunsets are multi-coloured and his sweat and blood when he falls onto a steel platform look real. Meg Ryan has probably never looked more beautiful or assured while Cage brings an other-worldliness to his character than few actors could achieve. The behind-the-scenes documentaries feature fun talks with the cast both in studio and on location (skyscraper shots that terrified both Cage and Franz because they are real - short on girders way up there).

Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 5.1, Spanish Castilian 5.1 and Spanish Latin 2.0. Subtitles include English SDH, French and Spanish.

Maggie says to Seth about her lost patient - ""I wanted him to live..."" And Seth replies, ""He is living...just not in the way you think...""

6039701,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Meg Ryan - that should tell you enough right there.  There are very few BAD Meg Ryan movies.  Even fewer BAD romantic comedies that star Meg Ryan.

Then add Nicolas Cage - who is not one of my favorite people in the world - but is a TERRIFIC leading man.  He's not devastatingly handsome.  He's just interesting enough to draw you in.  And this is his best work.

Meg plays Maggie - a doctor who takes it very hard when she loses a patient on the table when she did EVERYTHING right and he should have lived, but did not.

Nicolas plays Seth - an Angel who develops a strong attachment to Maggie and wants to help her and ends up falling in love with her.  So much so that he allows her to see him - which he's not really supposed to do.

Dennis Franz plays Nathaniel Messenger - a former angel who decided to take the plunge (literally) and become human.  Maggie is his doctor and he guides Seth to understand more about what's going on and explain to him he can fall to Earth should he choose - and become human.

The movie follows their path to claim each other.  The most sensual and yet innocently sweet scene of any movie - a rainstorm and Maggie can't sleep - and she asks Seth to stay with her - although he won't let her see him.  The music enhances that scene immensely - Sarah McLachlan's Angel - a more perfect song, I couldn't imagine.

If you've never watched the movie - the ending is actually perfect.  It's not what you'd expect, but it is perfect.  And beautiful.  It's filmed beautifully, acted deliberately and wonderfully, and embedded as a fantastic memory.

6039724,4,B00FYPEEFS,"Kids, don't waste your time with fantasy romances like Twilight. Watch older, much more powerful films like City of Angels.

In this fantasy, Seth is an angel who is mesmerized by this female surgeon, Maggie, because he feels like she could see him or sense him. From that point on, Seth tries everything to be around this woman and eventually, he makes ""the jump"" and falls to Earth. He becomes human just to physically be with Maggie. And believe me when I say, when Nicholas Cage's Seth is in the same scene as Meg Ryan's Maggie, sparks really do fly. You really do feel like these two characters are not only full of passion and desire, but they're head-over-heels in love with each other.

Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are wonderful in this film, making it all the more clear why they became legends in their time. It's just so sad that they've both had such rocky careers ever since.",1393027200,,887,4.5375

6039736,3,B00FYPEEFS,"In my opinion; that is, if your a somewhat spiritual person, you may find the story offensive.  An angel of God giving up his life with God; for a woman is the thing that is considered a huge no, no, in scripture. I'm just saying.  I couldn't jive with it myself. That's me.

The acting and the story line is entertaining and romantic if you can get past the Angel going against God thing ;). It is well done, had gorgeous scenery and that McLaughlin song ""In the Arms of the Angel"" is in it. Hope this helps someone :)

Updated to 3 stars----> 9/6/15
Look people, regarding this not helping people; I am a pretty spiritual gal. I haves fasted and I have been celibate for 15 years okay... So I watch movies for many reasons.  I try to stay away from certain themes because the eyes are the window to the soul, (be careful what you allow into your mind).  With this said unless you are a Jesus and God freak like myself :), I think any woman would love this movie!  I am not judging anyone but I am being true to myself and any others that our under the same spiritual strictness.

In Summary, Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are great romantic actors and you would probably enjoys this movie a great deal if you are fans of theirs and a romance fan, might even be bearable for the guys. A good date movie. There that's all I have to say about that. :)",1391817600,,1347,4.1937984496124034

6039742,3,B00FYPEEFS,Pretty cute story but the way the angels are staring closely at their charges is weird.  Costumes were pretty bad on the heavenly hosts.  NC needs to wax his fur or cover it up.,1391472000,,177,4.176470588235294

Typical, quirky Nicolas Cage; and naturally beautiful Meg Ryan. A slow film, but definitely makes the point, ""if you knew this was going to happen, would you do it again?"" The answer is priceless. Enjoy MFJLabs 4x",1389657600,,376,4.875

6039755,4,B00FYPEEFS,The mix of music is delicious from ambient to ballads. The suspension of reality is present. Some of the supporting roles are wonderful.,1389398400,,136,4.956521739130435

6039757,3,B00FYPEEFS,"Although I love Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, this movie had my attention span short lived. Great actors, the subject and portrail was just was off for me. Acting is good, quality of the sets and filming good, so I am sure that the appeal is there to the right audience. I would suggest if the subject discription and trailer appeal to you, give it a try. I must say it was middle of the road for me, but went with 3 stars because of the Cast and filming quality.",1389139200,,460,4.122222222222222

It's so strange to see (young) Nick Cage in a roll that is tender, caring, loving - and not blowing something up or killing someone.  Very refreshing.

Meg Ryan, despite her personal issues, is fabulous in this movie.",1388966400,,289,4.415094339622642
6039764,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I have seen this movie more times than I can count and each time I fall in love with it, with Seth, with Messenger and wish I were
Meg Ryan.

The music is also very beautiful and evocative of all the sensuousness that these two people will never get to share enough. A
real heartbreaker.

I believed Nic Cage and Meg Ryan loved one another in real life when I saw this, and do every time I watch them together.

I weep each time I view it and I laugh too at the beauty of this imperfect world and our choices during our lifetime here.",1388793600,,534,4.066666666666666

6039777,5,B00FYPEEFS,"ok, yes it was ""sappy"" but I still liked it a lot..maybe just in the right mood for it tonight.  Kind of reminded me of Ghost, which I also love.  Just a feel-good movie-- and every once in awhile, it's good to watch those!",1387756800,,223,4.045454545454546

6039781,2,B00FYPEEFS,"I was quite surprised to see such a weak story. I know this was in the movies and was talked to be a good one; but in my opinion it was a waste of my time.

Although, I absolutely LOVE Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. If I were them, I would not have accepted to take part of this movie... Unless they paid them the same 'big bucks!'... regardless of the poor production and much to desire script.

There were too many still scenes and my emotion rate was about steady; nothing too exciting or amazing - mainly considering the wardrobe, lines, and scenery.

Sorry! Dark angels???",1387324800,,573,4.336448598130841

6039787,2,B00FYPEEFS,"I had been warned that ""City of Angels"" was a pathetic remake of ""Wings of Desire"", but was determined to judge for myself.  Sadly, that opinion seems accurate, as it's obvious the ""City"" filmmakers didn't really understand the original, trying unsuccessfully to duplicate a world in which angels are everywhere, watching, guiding and occasionally envying human life, without any of the spiritual depth or magic essential to making a unique and believable statement.  Nicolas Cage as an angel looks like he's experiencing painful gas and Meg Ryan falls in love with him for no reason whatsoever. The borrowed aspects are speeded up as if American audiences consist of hyperactive dolts, and though the original is paced slowly for this American viewer, the end result is that  ""City"" is a cheap, commercial film, while ""Wings of Desire"" is a genuine work of art.  ""City's"" ending is unnecessary and irritating but just in case you actually buy this turkey, I won't reveal it.  See for yourself if you must, or watch ""Wings of Desire"".",1384387200,3,1034,4.988372093023256

6039819,1,B00FYPEEFS,"This film deserves at least one star for its beautiful, touching vistas...the stirring sunrises, the soft sunsets, and angels perched on precipitous heights with Los Angeles spread out before them. However, the remaining four stars disappear in a major plot hole in this tale of an angel, Seth, falling in love with a mortal woman, Maggie.

SPOILER ALERT

Seth is an inquisitive angel who comes to love a woman doctor, Maggie, who he mistakenly believes saw him as a real man. Craving physical sensations, Seth freely chooses to become a fallen angel in order to have a fleshly relationship, consummating their pairing by engaging in fornication on their first night together after his change. Tragically, Maggie dies the next day, and when asked by an angel as to whether Seth's decision to fall from grace ""had been worth it,"" he replies that a few physical sensations of Maggie were worth an entire eternity without her.

Here lies the plot hole...

Seth is an ANGEL!!!!! He knows that he could have spent eternity together with Maggie experiencing a perfect, fulfilled, joyous love if he had remained an angel...yet he gives up eternal love for a carnal love!?! Simply preposterous and laid the movie to waste.",1377907200,3,1214,4.936274509803922

1. The cast is pretty good, dialogue is great for this genre, Cage and Ryan make a believable couple
2. This movie is so well written you feel every ounce of sadness and passion as if you were the character
3. There is a great underlining point in this movie that you must watch all the way through to fully understand
4. Excellent soundtrack, Peter Gabriel's 'I grieve' couldn't be any more well suited for this movie!

This is suppose to be a romance drama but there is no romance and no drama... highly NOT RECOMMENDED. Don't waste your time like I did.

Over all the acting by Nicholas Cage and Megan Ryan was good and believable, but Megan is such an alive person that she doesn't portray the end well.  There was such a build up for them to finally get together, it was strange for it to end abruptly.  That was weird and very quick.  You knew it was coming since directors seem to know to make a person look joyously angelic before something happens, so it will shock us.  She is riding her bike down a hill with her eyes closed?  Thankfully angels don't turn human and marry us.  The Bible refers to early evil angels who came to earth and seduced women.  These were evil angels who were destroyed in the flood where everyone but Noah/his family  and animals were destroyed.  Of course lies about it make good movies??",1372204800,,1012,4.469945355191257

I hate when people don't warn you first and then offer a  movie SPOILER.

 I will say that ,I usually cry over animal movies- war movies- anything that has some powerful  theme or message to it.

I never cry over romance  movies for the most part.  Something pretty profound has to happen or be said to move me.

For some reason though, this movie in all its simplicity- got to me.

In the dark, in my den, watching this with my sister, my face had tears- ranging from happy to sad tears and back again.

This movie for me, was heart stirring right from the beginning.

Seeing Nicolas Cage's face, so wide with innocence and wonder, versus Meg Ryan's tired appearance and jaded outlook on life, was a good contrast.

The operating room scene(very early in the movie) sets the stage for the storyline and explains the immediate connection Cage begins to feel toward Ryan, a heart surgeon.

Most of the emotions conveyed in this movie are done with looks between each of them.

The dialog does not carry the entire story.

There is a German version of this movie, I believe, and it also has a sequel to it.

You would have to go to Wikipedia to get the name of it.
Problem is- when you look anything up online, regarding a movie, you have to worry you will see a spoiler.

I just may see the German version and if it is as good as it has been touted, I probably will see the sequel as well.

An angel falls to earth for the love of a woman.  This is a very romantic movie.  But beyond its melodrama and poignant photography, lies some of the most amazing queries put to thought.  This movie was great, because it's characters, particularly Nicolas Cage's character asked questions whose novelty we have all long since forgotten at kindergarten.  Yet, like children, experiencing the wonder of life for the first time, this movie gives us an opportunity to rediscover what we'd already discovered, but now in a rich and philosophical way with the added context of life experience.

6039905,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Every morning at sunrise all the angels of Los Angeles are meeting on the Pacific Ocean beach to listen to the music of dawn. These angels are there to welcome and accompany dead people to the other side of this life. We can't see them, we can't hear them, but some of us can feel them, sense their presence because some of us are angels who chose to become human.

We all love angels and we all have angels in our lives, human terrestrial life or eternal life or mental and spiritual life. What we don't know is that some of the angels we are in love with are real angels but it would change nothing in our minds because these angels of ours are soul friends, soul companions and soul mates. Sometimes it does not work both ways and the angels of mine do not consider me as an angel for them but it does not matter because an angel is a creature of the mind.

So we live with those angels who inspire us and we must keep in mind they do not have wings and we do not become winged angels by becoming their angels and yet they can fly. They are right in front of me any time I ask them or summon them. They haunt my mind and my heart and I cannot live without them anymore even if they are inhabiting my soul.

That's what this film is all about. A real angel decides to become human out of love but the woman he loves and loves him is so haunted by that angel face of his that she imagines she is able to fly, on her bike mind you. No one has a second chance. She will meet with her fate and he will have to remain human.

Touching film though slightly romantic, sweet, mellow, close to melodramatic at the end.

Remember you do not need to believe in angels because they do not exist because we believe in them. They exist all by themselves and they are happy when we know they exist for our sake, otherwise life goes on and an angel's life is eternal: he will see billions of dying men and women and children in his eternal life. And every morning he will come to the beach to salute the sun rising in the East, in their backs, over the Rocky Mountains.

6039906,5,B00FYPEEFS,"An angle, Seth (Nicolas Cage) on a mission to pick up a soul, is enamored of a woman, Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) he comes across. Even though he is supposed to be invisible, she looked straight at him as a man. From that point on he contemplates maintaining a life with her. Unfortunately they are different species.

A chance encounter with a mysteriously sensitive and understanding hospital patient, Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz) opens up the Seth's opportunity by explaining that due to free will Seth can die and be reborn as human if he really wants to.

But does Seth want to give up immortality? And at what cost?
Maggie does not believe in angles; so how will she react?

This film has some excellent photography and the pictures of Tahoe make you want to live there forever.

The film was based but no exactly copied form an earlier movie ""Wings of Desire"" (1987).

If you are interested in fallen angels then you can not miss ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"" (1945)

If not, then you'll always love it. Sometimes it makes me wonder if an angel watches over me. I would have fallen too, just to be with the one I love.",1308182400,,325,3.7941176470588234
6039909,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Nicolas Cage gives a wonderful performance as Seth, an Angel who falls in love and begins to long for the ability to express that love, in a film that in some respects resembles the 1930's film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" with Fredric March and Evelyn Veneble. Seth's assignment as an angel is to help the dead cross over in this quasi remake of the Wim Wenders foreign film, ""Wings of Desire."" Few films since the glory days of Hollywood and the old studio system have been given the romantic glow of this film.

Meg Ryan is Maggie, the heart surgeon who is the object of Seth's affection. He is stunned when she somehow senses his prescence when trying to save one of her patients, and is touched and bewildered by her. Andre Braugher steals every scene he is in as Seth's fellow Angel and friend. They all hang out at the library and gather every morning at the beach to see the sunrise and hear the singing of heaven.

Dennis Franz has a fine turn as a patient in Maggie's hospital who knows Seth is there because he too was once an Angel. As Seth and he become friends, Seth contemplates how wonderful it would be to truly love Maggie, and searches for the courage to leave heaven behind and, simply fall.

This is one of the most romantic movies to come out of Hollywood in decades and has a message about the wonderful things we all take for granted. More than that, it is a story about the importance of love, even one felt for only a moment, for it is that experience which makes us special among all creation. To love is all, and to be loved in return is truly divine.

There are some memorable scenes in this romantic and haunting film. One involves the simple act of shopping for fruit at a farmer's market. Another involves Maggie being able to feel Seth in her room but unable to see him. Even Hemingway's Moveable Feast plays a part in this magical throwback film to a bygone era. This is very much a film which could just as easily have been made in the 1930's.

I will not ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human. This film is for anyone who has ever loved someone as Seth does, who would trade all eternity for just one breath of her hair. If you have ever loved someone so much your heart ached when they were not with you, then you will be deeply moved by this film. It is painted in broad romantic brushstrokes and colored in rich oils not easily removed from our hearts. This is a truly memorable film you will watch over and over.

Films like this are rarely made anymore and this is one to cherish. You will never forget the line: ""When they ask me what I liked best...I'll say it was you.""",1302825600,,2689,4.273084479371317
6039910,5,B00FYPEEFS,"This didn't feel so much like a movie as a major wake-up call to life, with this message: Cut out what doesn't matter, and live fully. We're all a little bit angel, and we need to start living that way.",1299888000,,202,4.075
6039911,1,B00FYPEEFS,"This movie is absurdly depressing.  Maybe if you had some horrible event in your life this would make you feel like it wasn't so bad.

These ethereal beings are not necessarily trapped for all time in a netherworld of subservancy to the living.

Seth (Cage) is one such spirit. He watches surgeon Maggie Rice (Ryan) trying to desperately save a man that he's come for, sees her look right at (and through) him when she fails, and instantly falls deeply in love with the lady. Seth follows and eventually makes himself visible to the chronically insomniac Maggie; he longs to be able to touch, to comfort and to be with her.

When Seth discovers that another of her patients, Mr. Messenger (Franz) is a fallen angel who chose to become mortal so he could marry and have a family, he must decide on either eternal life alone or a finite one with Maggie. The choice seems obvious to Seth but cruel fate intervenes. This love story has an incredibly sad and ironic ending.

But I have ""City of Angels"" listed as the worst movie ever made.  Now, why would I say that?  It glamorizes the ""real very first sin"" and that is an angel disobeying God by rejecting the place God placed them in (the first sin was when an angel wanted God's place).  Yes, I know it's just a movie but this is literally the lowest possible moral rung.  There is no going back for an angel.  There is no plan of redemption.  A fallen angel goes from the best possible to the worst possible condition without the possibility of return.  The other angels would not look upon him with any form of admiration but rather with horror at what he did to destroy himself and it would greatly negatively affect the lady if he was allowed to contact her at all at that point.  He would be the worst thing for her and his ""affection"" would be the very opposite of true love.  It is a sad, sad tale of the true beginning of all woes.

6039935,5,B00FYPEEFS,"CITY OF ANGELS starring Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage is a moving film.  Cage plays one of God's messenger's, Seth, who happens to fall in love with Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon, who is adamant into believing that Seth is actually an angel.  But as the film proceeds, their relationship blossoms into a sweep you off your feet type of romance that is seldom seen in films these days, but lives are altered in the process.

The highlight of the film is Cage's character Seth.  Throughout the film he carries an expressionless but gentle and friendly faade with whom he meets, especially with Maggie as well as with his angel cohort, Cassiel (Andre Braugher) and hospital patient, Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz); Franz and Cage's dive into the ocean and catch a wave scene is quite a metaphor to the film as well as the concluding scene, which only shows how the simple things in life are taken for granted.

This may eventually become a classic, or if it is not already, end up on the American Film Institute's top films.  The production, the screenplay, and the cinematography are exceptional.  And for those who enjoy a little romance and tinge of metaphysics in a film, CITY OF ANGELS is not at all too deep to understand but enlightening.  The theme of this film is quite similar to films, such as MEET JOE BLACK and WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, which have the underlining meaning involving immortality.",1213920000,3,1400,4.709016393442623
6039936,5,B00FYPEEFS,"This is a definate chick flick but it's a good one.  I love the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage in here.  She plays a Dr and he's an Angel who sees her in the hospital where she works.  She can see him but he doesn't let her know his secret.  The only way their relationship can grow is if he leaves his 'life' as an angel.  He can leave the life of no death, pain and sadness, and trade it for a normal life that humans experience.
They both act really well in this and it was good to see Meg in a more serious role.  I cannot go into more depth without giving you the ending, but I have to stress that this is such a beautiful movie (ok a little depressing in parts) but overall so good.  You will most probably need tissues; it never fails to make me cry.  It's such a beautiful romantic story and an under-rated movie for sure.  I love it and it's one of my all time favourites.

I like love stories, but this was just too corny for me.  Meg overdoes her perky-girl-next-door persona.  When she flashes her big trademark grin or lets a single tear trickle ever-so-slowly down her beautiful face, it feels like she's just posing.  I didn't buy her as a real person; there's too much staring thoughtfully into the camera and spouting trite dialogue.  And who races downhill on a bike at the edge of a cliff with no hands and eyes closed?  I'm still wondering why Nic Cage is a star.

She is utterly believable as a young heart surgeon who falls in love with a haunting Nicholas Cage [her angel]. I found Cage's performance strong [because he is a strong actor], but in this case, not strong enough to maintain my suspension of disbelief. The script is a little heavy-handed on the metaphors, like Ryan's ""heart surgeon"" role, and the fact that angels must literally ""fall"" out of their protective, celestial perches in order to experience what humans feel when they ""fall in love."" I dunno. Maybe thse are minor points, but they seemed a tad hokey to me. What happens as we follow the foibles of Nick's coming to terms with human frailty - as well as the conclusion - are also a little predictable. I did, however, love Dennis Franz's performance as a fallen angel who learned to accept - and adapt to - his new role as a human being. He brought some much-needed levity to a script that might have otherwise found itself drowning in self-indulgence. In the end, this is a film about true love, and about how much we're willing to give - or let go of - in order to feel it in the first place. In a world where everything is over-analyzed, and caution is at an all-time high, it was a welcomed relief to visit this over-the-top look at romantic love one last time...before we forget it ever existed.

6039954,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I watch movies, read books and listen to music for the sheer joy of doing it.  I don't consider myself any kind of expert on what any particular film was based on, so learning this movie was based on a more poetic german masterpiece only meant that I had to add another movie to the list of movies I'd like to see.

But this movie, this movie was a classic in it's own right.  What woman doesn't dream of an angel falling so deeply in love with her that the angel would forego even heaven to be by her side, hell, to ask it even more honestly, what woman doesn't dream of anyone falling in love with them enough to give up something they have and/or love?  I caught this movie by mistake one day, buying a center channel speaker for my home theatre system the guy at the store started this movie and I was hooked from the first compelling scenes with the little girl and her mother.  I paid full price for an open item in order to take this movie home and watch it.  My money has rarely been spent better.

The moods were well played and well set by the director, the casting was spot on and the music did what music should do in movies, it made the scenes better.  Anyone who sees this movie will feel the hot tempo of Paula Cole's ""Feelin' Love"" while Seth (Nicolas Cage) sits outside the bathroom where Maggie (Meg Ryan) is bathing while thinking his name and immediately want to find themselves in a like situation, it's impossible not to.  The Googoo Dolls and Sarah McLachlan songs are also extremely well placed but my favorite song was actually the U2 offering ""If God Will Send His Angels"".

Although the line Maggie says to Seth is beautiful and moving, I will say that the last line Seth says to Cassiel comes off a little too dramatic and slightly forced, but it doesn't in any way deter from the sheer beauty of this movie.

If you do see it, please, do yourself the favor of trying not to have any distractions and open yourself up to the poignancy of the movie in each scene and as a whole, it's really a worthwhile watch and more, a worthwhile feel.",1164585600,,2065,4.296391752577319
6039955,4,B00FYPEEFS,"Years ago I rented ""Wings of Desire"" after reading how wonderful it was. I'm sorry to say I was confused and uninterested from the start and did an extremely rare thing for me: I turned it off. It could very well have been wonderful, and had I invested a little more time in it, I might have become a fan of it. It's something I wonder about to this day--but honestly, not enough to rent ""Wings"" again.

I knew ""City of Angels"" was the American ""re-make"" of ""Wings"" and I chose to see it anyway. I'll tell you this: my house may be been burgled or burned while I watched. I'll never know. I was drawn in by ""City of Angels'"" imagery, it's music, it's quiet and careful pacing, and by the understated performances of Cage and Ryan. It is one of only a handful of films I can think of that I couldn't get out of my mind--for days!

The out of this world fantastic subject matter of an angel falling in love with a human and contemplating relinquishing his immortality could make this movie a bit of an eyeroller, but the filmmakers respect both the story and their audience and they make it work. This is a quiet, romantic, and melancholy film. It is almost like a dream and it is likely to draw you into it's unusual little world.

DVD features: Nice additional behind the scenes interviews and music videos (from a soundtrack that is equally familar and challenging and ultimately, rewarding).",1162512000,,1393,4.454901960784314
6039956,3,B00FYPEEFS,"This 1998 romantic drama is as fanciful as fantasy movies come, and John Seale's beautiful cinematography goes a long way toward creating the dream-like quality essential to pull this type of movie off. Director Brad Silberling and screenwriter Dana Stevens have decided to amplify the romantic elements of Win Wenders' wondrous 1987 classic, ""Wings of Desire"", but stick to the basic plot elements. The transatlantic adaptation is not altogether successful because the greater themes of immortality and human fallibility in the original film have been submerged in favor of more individualized needs like sensuality and love. The thematic change trivializes the film into little more than a piece of romantic whimsy.

Now set in Los Angeles, the plot focuses on an angel named Seth who walks freely among the living and remains unseen unless he so desires. He gets drawn to Maggie Rice, an exacting surgeon who loses her first patient on the operating table. In the middle of her personal crisis, Seth comes into her life filling an emotional void, setting the stage for the pivotal decision he needs to make - remaining immortal as an angel or becoming human to experience the passion he feels for Maggie. Luckily, in probably her best dramatic performance, Meg Ryan is especially resonant as Maggie as she mutes her natural sprite-like manner into a palpable sadness that fits the character.

With a part that risks skirting parody during the first half, a steadily unblinking Nicolas Cage plays Seth in a plaintive, child-like manner until the story moves toward its inevitable climax. I still find it difficult to believe that Seth's discomforting, Norman Bates-like manner would provide such a powerful attraction to Maggie at the outset. I also think the ending plot manipulations are a botch, a contemptible attempt to twist the viewer into thinking a greater point has been made when in fact, the viewer has been sucker-punched. Andre Braugher's becalming manner is used to good effect as fellow angel Cassiel, and Dennis Franz is appropriately ostentatious as a junk-food-addicted hospital patient who is not what he appears to be. By the way, the interiors of the San Francisco Main Library (opened two years before) never looked better than under the guise of LA's in this movie.

There are a surprising number of extras for such an early release DVD (1998) with three separate commentary tracks, the first by Silberling, the second by Stevens and co-producer Charles Roven, and the third by composer Gabriel Yared. Seale and production designer Lilly Kilvert contribute select-scene commentaries on the other side of the disc. There are two featurettes - a half-hour making-of documentary called ""Making Angels"" and a ten-minute short focused strictly on the visual effects. Seven deleted scenes, two music videos (including the Goo Goo Dolls' then-omnipresent MTV hit, ""Iris""), and the theatrical trailer round out the major DVD extras.",1156377600,,2950,5.19327731092437

This film is not recommendable, it is a torture for each reasonable human. And the question is not, what is the feeling of angels or what is their relation to us. The question is, where is the effect of natural science or French enlightenment, of Kant and Epicurus, of Giordano Bruno or Schopenhauer, of philosophy and real literature, if trash like this fills the brains?",1124841600,2,988,4.67816091954023

6039972,3,B00FYPEEFS,"(Genesis 4:25).  For centuries, men have wondered and theorized about the nature of angels and their relation to us.  From Martin Luther to John Calvin to modern-day Dr. David Jeremiah, these ethereal creatures sometimes hold more fascination for us than God.  The premise of City of Angels is intriguing.  It seeks to answer some of our questions about angels, life, and death.  Yet I was not turned on by the film until the end, which I will not reveal.

The main reason I was turned off was because the main character and angel, Seth, came across as a huge dimbulb.  Assigned to watch over heart surgeon Maggie (Meg Ryan), Seth (Nicolas Cage) falls in love with her. Here is where the movie begins to be laughable.  Seth comes across as an escaped mental patient who is stalking Maggie.  He stares at her, makes no sense when he talks, and appears anywhere she does.  Instead of treating Seth with caution and fear, Maggie proceeds to boss him around and be increasingly mean to him, even physically assaulting him at one point with a weapon.  In the Bible, angels' appearances to men have been received with awe and fear.  Maggie whips Seth like a dog.

Dennis Franz is the breath of fresh air in the film as an angel who has chosen to ""fall"" and become human.  Like the Little Mermaid, an angel who falls can never go back to the ""sea.""  The angel loses all his angelic powers such as understanding all languages, never feeling pain, and being able to travel at the speed of thought.  But why would angels give up who they are and the incredible powers they have for base senses like taste and touch?  Angels are curious about humans, that is true.  But they are curious what it is like to be on the receiving end of salvation.  Not to become obese by eating junk food, or to learn what it is like to have a woman treat you like sh**t.

The cinematography in this movie is great.  The scenes of the silent angels on the beach at dawn, the great overhead bird's eye views of L.A.  Truly terrific.  I also have no problem with Meg Ryan's performance, even if her character was a witch.",1119916800,,2088,4.465608465608466

6039974,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Nicolas Cage gives a wonderful performance as Seth, an Angel who falls in love and begins to long for the ability to express that love, in a film that in some respects resembles the 1930's film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" with Fredric March and Evelyn Veneble. Seth's assignment as an angel is to help the dead cross over in this quasi remake of the Wim Wenders foreign film, ""Wings of Desire."" Few films since the glory days of Hollywood and the old studio system have been given the romantic glow of this film.

Meg Ryan is Maggie, the heart surgeon who is the object of Seth's affection. He is stunned when she somehow senses his prescence when trying to save one of her patients, and is touched and bewildered by her. Andre Braugher steals every scene he is in as Seth's fellow Angel and friend. They all hang out at the library and gather every morning at the beach to see the sunrise and hear the singing of heaven.

Dennis Franz has a fine turn as a patient in Maggie's hospital who knows Seth is there because he too was once an Angel. As Seth and he become friends, Seth contemplates how wonderful it would be to truly love Maggie, and searches for the courage to leave heaven behind and, simply fall.

This is one of the most romantic movies to come out of Hollywood in decades and has a message about the wonderful things we all take for granted. More than that, it is a story about the importance of love, even one felt for only a moment, for it is that experience which makes us special among all creation. To love is all, and to be loved in return is truly divine.

There are some memorable scenes in this romantic and haunting film. One involves the simple act of shopping for fruit at a farmer's market. Another involves Maggie being able to feel Seth in her room but unable to see him. Even Hemingway's Moveable Feast plays a part in this magical throwback film to a bygone era. This is very much a film which could just as easily have been made in the 1930's.

I will not ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human. This film is for anyone who has ever loved someone as Seth does, who would trade all eternity for just one breath of her hair. If you have ever loved someone so much your heart ached when they were not with you, then you will be deeply moved by this film. It is painted in broad romantic brushstrokes and colored in rich oils not easily removed from our hearts. This is a truly memorable film you will watch over and over.

6039979,3,B00FYPEEFS,"I want to explain why I don't like this movie, without spoiling anything.  First off, this movie has one of the most fantastic soundtracks ever, and I fully reccomend buying it, even if you never see the movie, it's fantastic.

Second... hmmm... I like movies that make me think.  If it's a comedy, great jokes, a fun time... If it's a drama, I want real issues, I want a good plot... and if it's a tragedy... well, there better should be a good reason to make it a tragedy.

This movie makes me feel helpless.  There is a point they continually try to drive home in this film, so much so that it overwhelms you at times.  That point is life, breathing, thinking, feeling, living.  The movie has Angels in it.  Angels cannot feel, cannot touch, can't feel emotion.  An angel asks a child in the beginning what she will miss about life.  She says ""fuzzy pajamas"".  It's about textures, it seems.

Well they make their point, they make it well... aaaaaaannnnd then they go overboard.  This movie could have been fantastic and meaningful, and they felt like they had to push it too far to make their point.  We get it, okay, we get it... you didn't have to go and make it end like that, okay?

Basically I loved this movie until I got to the end.  I've never watched it again.  Why did I even give it 3 stars then?  Well, because I thought that until the end, they did a great job.  So, just turn it off 10 minutes before the credits.  It's perfect then.",1106092800,4,1451,4.323420074349443
6039980,3,B00FYPEEFS,"""Wings of Desire"" is among of my favorite movies.  To say that ""City of Angels"" is a remake of ""Wings of Desire"" is wrong.  It is a retelling. ""City of Angels"" in my opinion was not as profound as ""Wings of Desire"". It lacked the impact of how Angels were portrayed and focused more the underlying theme of love.  Which brings me to my point that ""City of Angels"" is just a love story.  And a fairly decent love story it is by Hollywood standards. If I had never seen ""Wings of Desire"" then I would've probably liked this movie more.  But being a fan of ""Wings of Desire"" has somewhat heightened my expectations of movies that portray Angels.  In ""Wings of Desire"" the Angel that chose mortality used love as an inspiration to desire all that life has to offer.  While in ""City of Angels"" the Angel there chose mortality because he fell in love with a mortal woman.  It is not as deep and inspirational as ""Wings of Desire"". They are two very different movies.",1103155200,,960,4.3841807909604515

It makes you sure that they are everywhere. For anyone who has loved someone completely or would like to be loved that way it is is the movie to own. I never get tired of watching it. Andre Braugher is excellent as is Dennis Franz. It makes you laugh, cry and gives you hope. If you don't like this film, you need a hug. If you do like this, try Phonomenon with John Travolta too.

This movie came out right after my grandfather died, and as an over-thirty, experienced person who had watched him suffer through this wasted time brought on by age, I expected to be happy he was released when he died, but I was not.

Maybe it was the fact that the nurse gave this 85 year old man who had not had solid food in a year a huge Potassium pill and left after he said that no, he didn't want any water, just to watch him code four minutes later. Maybe I just wasn't ready for him to be gone less than 12 hours after I'd taken him to the hospital. Maybe I just wasn't ready to be done loving him and changing his diapers and fighting with Grandma to not treat him like he had a choice. Maybe it was just that he was the most important man I've ever known. But I wasn't ready then, not at all, and this movie helped.

It made me remember why we're here, to love, even when we know it will end in hurt.

It made me allow myself to hope I'll see him again one day.

It made me accept that quality of life is not something that I should take for granted.

But most of all, this movie let me think Gramps might still be around, looking over my shoulder, encouraging me to watch the traffic go by, appreciate my daughters teen years, get past Grandma's senile dementia, because he loved her even for all that she is.

See the movie if you haven't, buy it for when you need to see it if you have. You won't regret it - everyone hits that point/realization about life, and death.

6039983,2,B00FYPEEFS,"But that's not saying much.  Sorry, but I can't HELP but compare it to the Wim Wenders products and this is SO Hollyweed it hurts.  While watching the flick, myself and a friend of mine (yes, a chick who thought it was goofy too) figured out the ending LONG before it happened because we could just TELL it was going to be some carefully-calculated-to-pluck-the-heart-strings-in-that-shallow-hollyweed-way type of movie.  Meg Ryan is capable of acting, as is Nicolas Cage, but both were pretty uninspiring in this.  She just didn't seem very doctor-like, and he didn't seem very angel-like (kept picturing him in 'Leaving Las Vegas') in this.  The story's fault as much as anything.  The WHOLE mood of the flick is so somber, but fakely so.  I just didn't develop any empathy for the characters.

And yes, I am someone who can be moved by a movie... this fake Hollyweed stuff just doesn't accomplish much though...

Do yourself a favor and check out the Wim Wenders flicks.  Weird at times, but so much more engrossing than this emotionally empty schlock (I know it SEEMED emotionally charged, but that portrayed/acted-out emotion has to be believable in order to actually convey anything).

BUT, if you liked ""Sleepless in Seattle"" you'll likely be misty-eyed over this tragic tear-jerker that takes a deep (as deep as Hollyweed usually gets anyway) and moving (I wanted to move off the couch and go to bed) look at the mystery of life, love, and loss...

City of Angels is a remake of the German movie ""Der Himmel ber Berlin"" (The heaven over Berlin). That movie starts with the angel sitting on a broken church (Gedchtniskirche) in Berlin. Nicolas Cage sits on a skyscraper, America's cathedral.
He tries to get alive so he can feel and love. He is helped by another fallen angel played by a magnificent Dennis Frantz. He gets his wish, gets the girl but then...

6039987,3,B00FYPEEFS,"This film is so sad. I sat through it crying, whether it's the heartbreaking opening scene, when you first realise that Nicolas Cage is playing an angel, or the fact that the whole film is too good to be true, when the ending gets going.
At first, from seeing the trailer, it seemed like Meg Ryan couldn't see Nicolas Cage's character, and I thought it was going to be another Ghost. But it turns out the trailer shows all those bits of the film, and she really can see him.
The whole film is very strange at times, when people are having to act, and pretend not to see/feel Nicolas Cage around them. If I was them, I'd be jumping out of my skin as soon as he came anywhere near.
The whole angels thing is an interesting thing to do a movie about, and how many there are, and how they can't feel emotion. Well, Nicolas is perfect to play one of them, as he always has the same facial expression! And he's got such a lovely smile too. I still don't get why the angels all have to dress in black, but it is funny how Nicolas is scared of heights, poor baby, and is often shot very high up!
This is a great movie, but if you're a guy, you'll be sitting through it, rolling your eyes, and generally not caring. If you're female, I suggest you get the tissues BEFORE sitting down to watch this. You'll need it from the opening scene, believe me.",1082592000,7,1340,4.1976744186046515

6039989,3,B00FYPEEFS,"It was girl's night out and I was (literally) dragged to see this movie, when it first came out!  It's not that I hate `chick flicks' (which this movie is) but I'm more of an action movie type person.  Well, `City of Angels' is one really sad chick flick and could have been more than just a sad chick flick.  I must say that the idea of this movie was promising (since this is a remake of the German film ""Wings of Desire"" which I have not had the privilege of viewing), but I feel looses its hidden meaning and turns into a sad clich love story. Plus, everyone knows the shpeal, but I guess I should go into further depth with the movie. (Hey I'm not that shallow...ok maybe I am.)

Ok, so angel dude goes down to earth to do his ritual `guide the souls' to heaven thing.  Yet, this angel dude was different from the rest of the angels because he's curious about the inner workings of humans.  He even keeps tabs on what things they like when they were alive in his handy dandy notepad (which was a part I liked). Well, he comes across chick doctor, who was working on a patient.  At that moment, she looks at him, screaming not to take the kid's life...well, he thinks she saw him.  Actually, he was in invisi-angel mode only visible to the dead and other angels.  Well, this perplexes him.  He's like, 'did she really see me??' Well, she doesn't and sadly her patient dies.  She has a hard time coping with the fact that she couldn't save him and angel dude is totally intrigued by this woman.  So he follows her and watches her interact with a world that he feels he should be apart of...(for some odd reason I hear Ariel singing ""Part of your world"" ...dude...have I made a correlation between `The Little Mermaid' and this movie...scary). Other angels notice his infatuation, and then warn him to stay clear from his new hobby. To no avail, he doesn't listen.  So, he meets up with her and helps her cope.  Well, they sort of take a liking to each other, although chick doctor has a hard time trusting him. Sadly, she totally freaks out when she finds out he's an angel. Boom there goes all that built up trust out the window.  Wouldn't you totally freak out if the guy your crush'n on turns out to be an angel?  He's now totally in love with this girl and she's totally freaked but oddly feels connected to him. Unfortunately, the freak out thing wins out and she can't be with him.  He's in a dilemma.  Hmm, he could become human, but how??  There's this one guy that did it, but can he do it?  Does he have enough cajones to become human for the sake of true love??  Well go watch it and find out?  (Yea, you know what happens!)

Ok, so my portrayal is a bit off, but I think you get the gist of it.  I felt thhis movie focuses more on the romance between Seth and Maggie (wow I actually know their names) just to appease the female audiences need for romance. This could have been a great movie if they focused on his need to understand the human soul rather than do the `give up everything for the sake of love' clich.  Another thing, I noticed with Seth is that he was in love with the idea of being in love (sort of like a Romeo complex...Oh I could go on and on interrogating the inner workings of Seth, but I'm only allocated 1000 words and I'm probably boring you right now!) and Maggie falls into play.  Her character was rather interesting (teaching Seth about humanity while he teaches her to trust in the unknown) until the ending where he acts like a complete idiot.  (This is another thing I hate about the movie.)  I guess there was a reason why the ending ended that way.  Maybe the director people wanted to get back to the main reason as to why Seth wanted to be apart of the human world in the first place.  However, storyline played more on the romance thing and lost the aspect of Seth's curiosity of humanity.

As for the actors: Nicholas Cage did a good job as Seth (he tends to do well where his characters are rather angsty) and the same goes for Meg Ryan's portrayal of Maggie. I liked how the special effects set the mood of the story and the musical score.

To sum it up, I would probably enjoyed the movie more if they had focused on a main theme rather than give in to the masses and create a clich love story.
The movie was good until the part where he had to choose whether to stay and angel or not, the rest was a let down.  (Reason why I gave this movie three stars) Yet, I can recommend this movie to those who are into tragic love movies, but to those who hate sad endings, don't waste your time!",1074556800,3,4541,4.2491268917345755

Let me add that I am glad I did not because many of the negative reviews here are based upon a comparison of the two, and I would not have wanted any comparison of that sort to subtract one iota from how deeply I was affected by this truly beautiful film.  Everything about it is so well done, the music, the imagery, the photography, the editing. And then there's Meg Ryan's performance--WOW!  Her best, no doubt in my mind.  Ryan's beauty has never risen above the ""irrisitibly cute"" level in my mind, but the photography, and lighting are so spot-on that she looks gorgeous in some scenes, so much so it hurts your heart to look at her.  Dennis Franz is superb, and Cage does what he has to to make this film work, which means he is both etheral and understated.  The limited range he displays in this film is in service to the larger story.  Please take note of the detail in this film, the wonderful performances of the lesser roles:  Ryan's friend Ann (Robin Bartlett), for one, and the two women( Deirdre O'Connell and Kim Murphy) who Ryan has to inform that their loved-one has died on the OR table. These two women are probably on screen for all of 45 seconds, but their performances are so on the mark, so creative, as to make them indelibly memorable because of their originality.  I find myself watching that scene over and over.
Silberling(sp?), the director, has it all under control, and the editor certainly knows how to cut a movie.
Having said all these great things, let me say that the ending did not work for me, not because it wasn't as happy as it could be, but because it seemed contrived, not well thought out, and the performances fell a little flat at this time.

Maggie too, is smitten with him, but is frustrated by their distance, and that she truly doesn't know him. The more she learns about him, the more she pushes away from him. Seth realizes he has a choice, between living as a human or staying immortal. When he does take the plunge, he finds her and their love story begins. Ryan and Cage convincingly play soulmates, but by the time they find each other and can be together, is very short lived, and near the end of the movie. It made the movie all that more sad, but I think the underlying theme is that time is so precious and shouldn't be taken for granted.

Directed by Brad Silberling
Genre - Drama
Set in Los Angles, in the opening scene an angel, Seth (Nicholas Cage) escorts a dying girl from the emergency room where she just passed away.  Net, we cut to an unusual site:  two men, clothed entirely in black sitting comfortably atop a freeway exit sign over a busy interstate highway overlooking the city.  No matter how you look at it, City of Angels will make you think about how angels might exist with us in our world.  We soon see that angels are everywhere - walking on rooftops, standing on the ""Hollywood"" sign, even in an airport control tower.
Seth finds himself escorting a dying heart patient from a cardiac surgery suite.  He stares intently into the eyes of the young surgeon, Doctor Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) as she struggles to revive her dying patient.  We learn a little more about angels: they can see us, and each other, but only a dying and delirious human can see them unless the angel wants a person to see them.
Later Seth follows Doctor Rice as she walks through a children's ward in the hospital. Rice seems to be walking aimlessly as she struggles to cope with the loss of her patient.  We see an angel in every room with the sick children.  Later that evening, Seth meets Doctor Rice in the hallway of the hospital after visiting hours as she is ""making mounds.""  He talks about the death of her patient.  He tells her that her patient ""... is living.  Just not the way you think.""
About this time, you may observe that the angels do not blink.  They look at our world and the people in it with a steady gaze, almost a stare.  As we watch Seth gaze intently at Doctor Rice, you understand he is falling in love.
During a night of fitful sleep, Doctor Rice awakens and opens a book on her nightstand.  We see the title of the book: Hemingway's ""A Moveable Feast.""  After reading the book, the next day she is in a good mood.  She thanks a boyfriend for the book.  He denies giving it to her, asking ""where'd you get it?""
Rice goes to the public library and asks if she can find out who checked the book out.  She again meets Seth and they leave together.  They visit a grocery store and stop to eat.  As Rice eats a pear, Seth asks her what a pear tastes like.  She asks him if he doesn't know already.  He answers, ""I don't know what a pear tastes like to you.""
Seth soon meets a patient under Doctor Rice's care (Dennis Franz) who turns out to be a former angel.  He tells Seth how he can become human: you just choose to fall to earth.  We also learn that angels all gather at sunrise and sunset on a beach.
Seth struggles, but finally chooses to become human so he can be with Doctor Rice.  It is a difficult transition and he suffers the indignities of a person new to the big city.  It is both a funny and sad commentary on humanity to watch him try to find Doctor Rice, and be beaten and robbed of his shoes on the street.
Seth and Doctor Rice do finally get together at her cabin on Lake Tahoe.  Their time together is very, very short.  I won't spoil the ending for you.  But the outcome is certain to bring a tear to your eye (or at least a lump to your throat).
City of Angles isn't just a ""chick flick.""  The music is outstanding (In the Arms of An Angel, for one) and I really ended the movie in a thoughtful state of mind.  In my opinion, City of Angels is a well-acted, interesting story.  The ending may make you consider just how short life really is.",1054512000,2,3625,4.29646017699115
6039999,2,B00FYPEEFS,"""City of Angels"" has a lot of cool ideas. It has a great style of direction about it. It's biggest problem is that it falls under the standard movie cliches for love stories. A shame, because the first two acts are very good. Nicolas Cage is an angel. He walks the Earth unnoticed and unseen by humans. It is suggested that in death, one can see or feel the angels, which is an interesting concept indeed. Meg Ryan is a doctor who is a little lovesick. Cage follows her around one day and becomes increasingly interested in her. Finally, she sees him and the two begin to fall in love. So far, the movie is interesting, original, and very well-acted. Then it comes to a point where Cage must make a choice. He must either stay an angel or become human and live with Meg. It doesn't take a genius to predict what happens. The movie loses itself in utter predictability and uses recycled story elements from so many other romance movies. I realize I'm a guy and that I probably shouldn't like this movie anyway, but I believe in giving movies a fair chance. I like the first two acts of this movie a lot. I like the concept, I like the characters, and I like the acting. The third act is just so contrived and desparate I wanted to shout in anger at the screen during its climax. I didn't hate this film. I just hated the outcome. Would I recommend it? No. But I don't doubt that there are people that liked it.",1053043200,,1409,4.3007518796992485
6040000,3,B00FYPEEFS,"This is dreary. WHile watching the film it seems better than average of its type; moving, original, gorgeous to watch. That, at least, is what I thought before watching the Wim Wender's film 'Wings of Desire'on which 'COA' is ostensibly based. I changed my mind fast. I would dissagree with the amazon.com reviewer above: Hollywood's constant leaching, and abysmal defiling, of European cinema's finest ideas is disgraceful, especially when one considers the amount of money cinema punters wasted on this aneamic 'remake'compared to what meagre earnings (comparitively) it's superior forbearer earned.
For those interested, 'Wings of Desire' is, as of my writing of this pseudo-review, due to be released on DVD at amazon.com soon. Check it Out.
To sum up: the measure of your enjoyment of these vastly different cinematic modes can be gleaned as follows: Do you enjoy Sarah MCLaughlan's soulful, crooningly sappy themesong for 'City of Angels', or prefer songs by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, a few of which grace ""Wings of Desire""'s soundtrack?
Non-'aggrevation induced by sub-titles' is also a must, unfortunately.",1051920000,,1117,5.31638418079096
6040001,5,B00FYPEEFS,"My main reason to see this movie was Nicolas Cage - he is my favorite actor, so I was going to see the movie no matter what.  Movies are a personal experience - it all depends what you want to take away from the experience of watching them.  I personally loved this movie.
This movie was very touching, if you picked up on the subtle nature of what was going on.  Maggie (Meg Ryan) was struggling with her faith while being a heart surgeon who can't see the connection between her work and faith in God.  Don't let that scare you - religion isn't the main focus of the movie.  It was very moving to watch Maggie come alive once she meets Seth (Nicolas Cage) who is an angel.
Another reviewer had a great point - the movie, if you spend time thinking about it, really does make you realize all the little things that we all take for granted.  Dennis Franz's character really brings these things to light, but he reminded me that you don't always have to take life so seriously - there has to be room for fun and enjoyment.
I will admit that I was disappointed with the ending, but every movie has to end and even though I needed some Kleenex it was a very powerful ending to a though-provoking movie.  The soundtrack of this movie is also great!  The songs perfectly fit each scene.
The most memorable line from the movie for me is when Seth says the following to Maggie shortly after they meet for the first time:
""Some things are true whether you believe them or not.""",1049760000,3,1469,4.316363636363636
6040002,3,B00FYPEEFS,"There's no question that 1998's `City Of Angels' is a very diverse movie.  It has great acting (some by an actor who comes off roles in `8mm' and `Snake Eyes'), love, demise, angels, and even a great soundtrack.  This movie resides nicely in my extensive movie collection, even though most of the others are comedies, dramas, or action movies.  Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors; which is why I bought this in the first place.  And I'm glad I did.  Cage's performance is actually one of his best, and Meg Ryan is also at her finest.  This is certainly not one of the best films I've ever seen (and it's not one of my personal favorites), but it is still pleasing and [at least] worth your time.
A lot of other reviewers have gone into great depth in explaining the plot.  Therefore I won't do the same; I'll just give a brief overview of it.  The movie's plot is based on the characters of Seth (Cage) and Maggie (Ryan).  Seth is an angel who is sent to ""pick up"" the people he's to take to heaven.  And when he is waiting for a patient of Maggie (she's a doctor) to pass, he finds himself fascinated with her relentlessness in not giving up on the child.  Seth almost feels violated; as Maggie looks him in the eye and (seemingly) tells Seth not to take him yet.  The way the two interact when they're supposed to not even notice each other is outstanding.  Even though Seth knows that he's dead, he sometimes feels as if he can intermingle with her.  This part of the movie is by far the best; and once the two actually are able to communicate (how I won't ruin for you; I wouldn't be able to explain it too well), everything that seemed to be amazing within the movie begins to fade.  The acting becomes more average and the story starts to slow down and not let you know where it's going.  There's not much more that can be said about the film or it's basis.  But as for the ending, it almost ruined the movie completely.  I won't spoil it for you; as you can decide for yourself whether or not it's fitting.  It came up too fast, I think.  And I will stick to my saying it was one of the weaker endings in the romance movie library.  I could've easily changed my ranking to 4 stars from three if they'd had a better ending.  But even if you know what actually happens or you hate poor endings in film, still watch the movie.  The beginning and (overall) acting by Nicolas Cage are certainly worth it.  But for the common Cage fan: stay away from this one.  If you are hoping for a repeat of any of his action sequences from his previous or latter movies, you will be extremely disappointed.  This is a love story, this is not an action movie.  Nonetheless, he does an excellent job with his role and almost outdoes himself.  Meg Ryan also rises to the occasion; for all you `Sleepless In Seattle' fanatics out there.
In the end, `City Of Angels' is, overall, a decent movie.  The cast list is pretty limited; as really only Cage and Ryan are given the chance to shine.  But Andre Braugher does a good job in the small supporting cast, and Cage's `Leaving Las Vegas' co-star Elisabeth Shue appears shortly as a pregnant woman.  Still, Cage and Ryan are all you need to enjoy this movie.  It was a very popular movie, but I do believe it's slightly overrated.  The ending was very ineffectual and may, in time, make you lose interest in the movie (meaning you won't want to watch it again).  But kudos to Nicolas Cage for trying something new with his distinct career.  Definitely watch this movie if you haven't already.  You may not completely like it, but you will at least be able to form some strong opinions about it.",1049155200,,3634,4.355654761904762
6040003,4,B00FYPEEFS,"I just finished watching this movie and I just had to write a review. I decided to watch this movie with some reservation.  I think Nicholas Cage is a fine actor but he looks just like my much despised ex. It didn't take too long for me to get past it though. He was so innocent and vulnerable, just like I imagine an angel to be. However, I just cannot buy Meg Ryan as a heart surgeon. But this is Hollywood after all, so I gave it a try. I'm glad I did.
This movie took me on an emotional ride. I don't often cry at movies (in fact, Tears of Endearment was on just before City of Angels and I was dry-eyed the whole three hours). But City of Angels... I cried. It was especially touching to see them in the bedroom, together but not quite together with the haunting ""In the Arms of the Angels"" playing in the background. God it gave me chills. And tears. I'm usually pretty good at predicting movies but I didn't see that ending coming, it hit me like a kick in the stomach. I hated that movie at that moment. I hated everything. I really wanted everything to be happily ever after. But then I realized.... shlocky happy endings are so empty. While I didn't like the ending, I had to respect it.

If you liked this movie, watch it again and then tell me the reason why.

6040005,2,B00FYPEEFS,"OK, just to get this out of the way up front, this is another review preferring ""Wings of Desire"" over this glossy remake.
It's not that I utterly detest ""City of Angels."" The director borrowed well from Wim Wenders' German original, particularly the nifty images of dark-coated angels roaming in this world, not in direct contact with human beings, but still able to influence them. And the leads, Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan and Dennis Franz, are capable actors.
And yet, and yet ... in the end, ""City of Angels"" is merely about a supernatural being who becomes human just to get into the sack with a pretty woman, overlaid with some homilies tacked on about how much he sacrificed to achieve that state, and everything being worth it no matter what tragedy strikes.
Guess they thought they were brave in giving the movie a sad, yet ultimately uplifting ending, but it falls flat.
In ""Wings of Desire,"" the angel's passion for a certain woman is the precipitating factor for him taking the plunge (quite literally), but it's just the final influence in a long-held desire to experience all the sensations that being human confers. Indeed, we never really see the two ""get together,"" and really, there's no need to. There's also much more of a spiritual dimension in the original as opposed to the pat, feel-good sort of theology tacked on to ""City of Angels.""
Yes, ""Wings of Desire"" has a much more deliberate pace than ""City of Angels"" and it does spin out a lot of philosophy, but don't let that scare you away. You don't need a college degree to enjoy it - just a willingness to take the time and let its subtle spell envelop you.
And I'll bet you'll find the moment in ""Wings"" when Peter Falk says, ""I can't see you,"" but I know you're there,"" much more delightful than the same moment Dennis Franz has in ""City.""",1043020800,11,1814,4.6191950464396285
6040006,1,B00FYPEEFS,"I don't know if this should be called a ""remake"" or just a crass, dumbed down, Americanized version of the Classic 1987 German film ""Wings of Desire"", directed by Wim Wenders.
This movie lacks everything that made ""Wings of Desire"" a classic and an international hit; depth, intelligence, great cinematography, imaginative, thought-provoking and powerful, yet understated acting.
Against my better judgement, I saw this movie out of curiosity, depsite the scathing reviews, because I was so impressed by Wings...  Even as a stand alone, without comparing it to the vastly superior Wenders film, this movie is typical Hollywood at it's worst, a contrived story, weakly written and acted, and even though not a happy ending, it cheaply and lamely attempts to tug at ones heart strings with sappy ending.
I wouldn't recommend ""Wings of Desire"" to anyone who liked ""City of Angels"".  The Wenders film would not be appreciated by anyone who enjoyed this waste of time and money.  This was a movie for the masses, and a very bad one at that.",1039910400,9,1035,4.971098265895954

That is Seth's (Nicholas Cage) answer when asked if he regretted giving up his existence as an immortal angel for a brief lifetime as a mortal human. Seth is an angel who has an insatiable curiosity about the human experience. He encounters Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) as she struggles to save the life of the man Seth is about to escort ""Home"". When she appears to stare him right in the eye and declares ""You can't have him!"" Seth is shocked and in amazement tries to find out who this person is. The more Seth learns about Maggie the deeper he falls in love.
This isn't an ""Angel"" movie although it does touch on life and death, God and the Heareafter... It's a love story.

6040009,2,B00FYPEEFS,"Not really a ""date film"" unless you have a date with lifelong celibacy, this chintzy remake of the lovely <i>Wings of Desire</i> plays like a bitter Gnostic parody of the original, in which the bumbling servant of an incompetent demiurge (played by Nicholas Cage with a kind of monosyllabic breathlessness,) gives up eternal life and the music of the sunset in order to participate in one of the most annoying sex scenes ever committed to film. After the indulgence (tacky in itself, but particularly grating when compared to the original film's treatment of the same event,) the occasion of his fall (the improbable Meg Ryan, as a heart surgeon with a peculiarly pointless straw-fiancee,) wastes no time in getting herself mowed down by a lumber truck. Our ex-angel then tries to convince himself that it was all worth it, as the audience is bombarded with evidence to the contrary.
Creepily mechanistic plot devices and schlocky dialogue further contribute to the pain-- and it's an awful lot of pain to go through just to confirm the same sad half-truths about the tragedy of human embodiment. Watch it with the one you love, just before you break the news of your decision to enter religious orders.",1030060800,9,1203,4.901960784313726
6040010,3,B00FYPEEFS,"Looking at a couple of Internet sites where viewers can write comments on movies they've seen, by and large ""City of Angels"" was written about in almost sacred tones. The underlying theme seemed to be that, if you didn't see the film as something spiritually enlightening, then you missed the point. Alas, I seem to be one of those who failed to see the movie as something special.
It's a fairly good picture, and one that should prove to be a decent night's entertainment. It is a romance akin to ""Ghost"".
The plot twist is that Nicholas Cage plays a guardian angel who becomes infatuated by Ryan's character. When he finds out that it is possible for an angel to give up their immortality and become human, he does so.
For American audiences, this transformation probably seemed to be a very original idea. In fact, the movie is a remake of Wim Wenders' 1987 film, ""Wings of Desire"". This won numerous awards, particularly for its cinemaphotography. Parts of it were in black and white, others were in color. Some sequences had splashes of color added to the black and white.
Because of the almost sacred attitude towards ""City of Angels"", I'll try not to be too earthbound in pointing out what I think are weak points in it.
First of all, angels are 'in' these days. That's fine with me, but there are angels and then there are angels. The ones in this picture are dressed in ordinary clothes and wear black trench coats. This worked well in the German version, which was far more symbolic. Frankly, in the remake they look both ordinary and a bit ominous.
Both versions give the female lead a career which is in some way death defying. The German heroine was a circus acrobat, which fit perfectly. She was an outsider and had a love of flight. ""City of Angels"" changes her to a heart surgeon. I suppose this change was made to give the character more control over life and death. It seemed plausible that an eccentric circus performer would believe her new lover used to be an angel. It's hard to envision a well educated and science oriented doctor believing that there really are angels, much less that one could choose to become human just because of her. Perhaps what made this idea so hard for me to accept was that casting Ryan as a heart surgeon is as believable as seeing Leonardo DiCaprio playing one of the stars of the World Federation of Wrestling. Had it been Jodie Foster or Meryl Streep, perhaps I could have bought it. And it is, by the way, Ryan's first big role since ""Sleepless In Seattle"" five years ago..
Nicholas Cage does make a superlative angel. In the last few years, he has successfully become mainstream. If you look at his small, lesser known films, you see that his acting range is wide indeed. His immense talent causes us to overlook the fact that it's implausible that an angel would want to experience the pain and sorrow we mere mortals endure.
The film is nicely photographed. While Los Angeles is called 'The City of Angeles', I know from having lived there for a long time that it's an unlikely place for such a spiritual event to occur.
The end of the film is heart wrenching, yet inevitable. It is Cage's performance that gives it, as well as the rest of the film, such impact. I do not mean to diminish Ryan's capabilities. My opinion is that she was miscast.
Wim Wenders is one of Europe's most creative and distinguished directors. Ironically, Brad Silberling, the director of ""City of Angeles"", only notable film is ""Casper"". As in the friendly ghost.",1017273600,3,3499,4.608974358974359

Although famine, war, disease, and higher prices torment the globe, they solve such problems as a guy who has stopped dating because he has lost his faith in women.""-- Ebert's Bigger Little Movie Glossary, p. 7.
This is a very interesting movie, and I'm not sure what to say.  It came after the 1996 remake of ""The Preacher's Wife"" and ""Michael,"" and is one of those angelic involvement movies, which are all chips off of ""It's a Wonderful Life's"" block.  As Ebert points out, most of the angels are really a bunch of sluffs that are just switching from a celestial slum to a terrestrial slum.  A moderate change of scenery.  But this film has a slightly different feel to it.  On to the Review!
ACTING:  Nicholas Cage does a wonderful job of acting in this movie.  I think I have finally burnt over the images of Cage in ""Raising Arizona,"" which was his ""Buckaroo Banzai.""  The thing to watch is his face:  he doesn't look like a delicate 1980's-""glam rock"" delicate angel, but he does convey a sense of wonder.  His eyes are always wide open, and his eyebrow are raised in a perpetual quizzical look.  He conveys the wonder of humanity.  Meg Ryan is there in the background and does a professional job.  They interact well in this starting to be stereotypical ""Mulder and Scully"" set up where the man is the believer and the woman is the skeptic.  In real world it is always the opposite.
STORY:  Yon read about fallen angels in the Bible, but this does not follow the Biblical pattern, since Satan was the head of the fallen angels (Revelation Chapter 13 or Isaiah chapter 14).  It is more of a ""fall forward.""  In ""War and Peace,"" Tolstoy speculates that before our birth, we were all angels and had lived forever before we were born.  The movie follows that general current, where an angel is given the freedom of will to become a human, a trade off from living a celestial, though incomplete and pain-free life, to become human, and have a complete and pain filled life.  Apparently, the opposition of pain and pleasure is a step forward.  This seems the essence of humanity, since not only did the angels fall, but man fall, and according to Christian theology, God became man.
As you suspect, the fallen, or progressed, angel falls in love with the human and experiences life, bot love and muggings, sunshine and rain.  The problems is that the movie ends a bit too soon.  It would be nice to see Seth Plate and Nathaniel Messenger in a film set twenty years after Seth's fall and to see what he has to say about life.  Can you really comment about life after only living a day or so?  Talk to some veterans this memorial day, and let them tell you about life, or any nonagenarian or centenarian you happen to meet.
ETHICS:  This film has an ethical side to it.  The shallow side of the question is :  ""When, if ever is it prober to break up an engagement?""  Several other films deal with this subject (Titanic, Princess Bride), and the consensus seem to be that anything is legal and lawful if it is done in the name of love.  In the real world, this is actually annoying--try it sometime, and see if you don't end up in court.  I wonder why Hollywood likes this motif of breaking up an engagement in the name of love.
Another ethical question is the question of human existence, a stable but un-progressing existence versus an unstable but progressive system.  We all experience both pain and pleasure, and it seems like too much pain and not enough pleasure.  (This is the refined pleasure I'm talking about, what you get from hearing Handel's Watermusic, not sensual pleasure of saccharin or pornography.  That never satisfies anyone.)  So is this the best of all possible worlds?  I's say yes.  You can have a stable machine-like existence, but you don't have a soul really until you feel pain.  No ecstasy without agony.  That is the problem with junkies--they live for sensation, but they don't have a life.
You see this with Nathaniel Messenger.  After his fall, he gets married and has a family and a stable job.  Good Citizen!  But he also becomes a glutton and expresses himself by tattoos.  Well, anyone can get a tattoo.  That isn't very meaningful or difficult.  But raising a family is rather difficult and isn't for cowards.  Yes, food and tattoos are part of life, but that is not the essence of humanity.
Lastly, is the point of existence really copulation?  One again, Hollywood says yes (Bicentennial Man, Peggy Sue Got Married).  But why is the meaning of life to be found in abed or in a red light district.  Something strange is afoot since we tend to laugh at people who are over-sexed.  It would have been ice to see Cage raise a family like Nathaniel Messenger.  Just Cage and Ryan would be a lonely family.
TWIST AT END:  I didn't see it coming.  Yes, it seems a bit formulaic, but sonnets are formulaic too--same rhyme scheme, same numbers of lines.  But that didn't stop Shakespeare or Camoens, or Browning, now did it!
ODDS AND ENDS:  I like how the movie showed the other angels in the background.  So we are not really alone, and neither are the angels.  A nice touch was the diversity of races among the angels, having the same variety in heaven as in earth.  Andre Braugher (Cassiel) is wonderful as a mentor.  He is not as intense as Samuel Jackson or Laurence Fishburn, and appeared quite calm as his angel was struggling with the question of falling.  Although I though it was predictable to have an African-America as the mentor.  It is part of the new Hollywood trend of having a ""Black Man's Burden"" of educating the whites (See The Legend of Bagger Vance, Bedazzled, Family Man.  Sam Jackson on the Jedi Counsel is NOT ""Black Man's Burden""-- his role could have been played by any race, any gender, or even a muppet).",990748800,2,5917,4.581506196377503
6040018,4,B00FYPEEFS,"Meg Ryan (as Maggie Rice, a heart surgeon) and Nicolas Cage (as an angel only known as Seth--well, Seth ""Plate"", actually;-) star in this serious, but warm-hearted fantasy, and both do their usual fine job.  But it was Dennis Franz (as an angel that has already ""fallen"") that added some real heart that this movie, on occasion, strangely lacked.  What a fine actor he is!
A remake of ""Wings of Desire"" (which I haven't as yet seen), this film has some wonderful moments.  As the title suggests, the story concerns angels, and the part they play when interacting with the dying.  This story becomes more interesting when Seth becomes attracted to Maggie after complications arise from a bypass surgery that she performed on a patient.  Soon after, Seth becomes obsessed with Maggie and in a wonderful scene, becomes visible to her as she walks the halls of the hospital after visiting hours.  Their interactions with each other throughout the film were touching.
When I think of angels, I think of beautiful people in white flowing robes, halos, light, and often wings.  ""City of Angels"" keeps the beautiful people concept, but to their credit, dresses them in ankle-length, dark gray leather coats.  Also, these angels don't really interfere with life, or fate.  Their sole purpose is to comfort.  This also created a rich, but subdued feel to the film.
The basic plot question is, will Seth take the ""fall"" and become human so he can have a life with the woman he loves?  It's not a cut and dried answer, as Seth finds tremendous beauty and comfort being an Angel of God.  And again, to the films credit ... well, you'll just have to purchase or rent the film to find out.
I had wished, however, that the footage that ended up on the cutting room floor could have been added to this film (fortunately the CD contains these deleted scenes on side B, along with some interesting commentary).  I would have also loved to have seen scenes where Maggie begins having a true revelation about Seth.  This important part was played down in the film, and ultimately hurt it, making it less satisfying for this viewer.  And because key scenes were deleted, which would have filled in things so very, very nicely, the final product came off as rather odd, or even a bit cold, at times.
I do however, highly recommend this film.  Along with what I've already pointed out, there are some nice special effects, some seductive scenery, along with a memorable soundtrack (especially McLachlan's ""Angel"", which played in the background of a rather poignant scene).  In many ways, I feel that parts of this film could be considered works of art.  Between 1 and 10, I give ""City of Angels"" a solid 8.  It's a very good film, a touching film, but a film that missed being a ""don't miss gem"" because of some surprising (to me, at least) editing decisions.  If we're lucky, maybe one day we will get to see the ""Director's Cut"".",989798400,3,2908,4.687007874015748
6040019,4,B00FYPEEFS,"There is an offbeat sense of style and passion which sets ""City of Angels"" apart from most other romantic films, a sense that comes from the movie's refusal to cast flashy, young stars amidst a cliched plotline. Instead, the film enhances a highly original story through two very enticing leads, Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, who have a pulsating chemistry that is intrical to the overall effect of the film. Director Brad Silberling's visual style and an enigmatic soundtrack all converge to create one of the best romances of all time.
The story begins by introducing us to Seth, an angel who brings freshly dead souls to Heaven (""I always asked them what they liked best about life""). He is not alone on Earth: there are many other angels on the planet, circulating throughout the city of Los Angeles in black trenchcoats, making their way to the beach to watch the sunset... heck, their local hangout is the public library. We are witness to many different situations, deaths and one convenience store robbery, where the angels interact in order to instill their sense of calm over people.
Seth is a very complex character, his charming and calm attitude and his handsome looks making him an ideal angel. On his arrival to take a dead hospital patient to Heaven, he meets eyes with Maggie, or thinks he does (she can't see him), and he is immediately drawn to her beauty. He later learns that if he wants her to see him, then she will in her own time, which, fortunately for him, is sooner rather than later. Maggie does not believe in angels or God, so the many strange occurances that surround her meeting and her getting to know Seth will test her faith in her beliefs.
Of course, this big question is whether or not they will end up together in the end. This is something that the movie toys with immensely as it examines the relationship between Seth and Maggie, which is more fragile than you would think. Maggie's insecurities about her newfound love and Seth's naivety of the ways of human life provide some heartwarming and sometimes tear-jerking moments which further enhance the bond between them. And once Maggie finds out about his origins, the relationship takes an entirely different avenue, which I'll leave you to discover on your own.
There is a nice amount of chemistry between the two lead acting talents. Nicolas Cage is the perfect choice for Seth: his angelic looks and his sensitive demeanor evoke feelings of serenity and calmness while the audience is graced by his onscreen presence. His character is very complex when it comes to making new discoveries about life, and Cage brings out all of the confusion quite convincingly. Meg Ryan is outstanding, as always, in her role of Maggie, who is required to experience big shows of emotion. Ryan does this superbly, and one scene that comes to mind takes place in an empty hospital stairwell, where Maggie cries for her patient. This scene gives the actors a chance to show what they are really made of, while subtly bringing to life to budding chemistry between the two that will culminate later on.
Two supporting roles of this film also add to the movie's story. Dennis Franz plays a fallen angel who chose to leave his heavenly status for a woman he fell in love with, and once he meets Seth, he begins explaining his experiences to his new friend in order to help him get a grip on his feelings. Andre Braugher plays Seth's confidant angel, who helps him keep his head on his shoulders. Both of these characters offer interesting insight and element into the secret life of angels, which makes us think of what really does exist out there.
The overall sense of style and grace that the movie charms us with seems a bit more sophisticated than most romantic films. The images are easy on the eyes: we are given everything at a steady pace, which allows us to pay more attention to the love story. Silberling's brilliant shots tell the story in such intricate and enlightening ways. Tight shots of the actors bring us more into the emotion of the film, while beautiful beach shots of the sunrise as underwater filming are breathtaking. Seth's ""fall"" will certainly be talked about for its wonderful composition: there is such a momentus amount of intensity and awe in that moment, which makes it one of the film's defining turning points.
The soundtrack is also a major key element to the success of this film. Most of the music centers around the theme of loneliness, wanting someone back, and (what else?) angels. The most evocative song of the film is Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel,"" which rings outs its haunting melodies and meaningful lyrics to a scene that practically melts my heart. The score for the film, done by Gabriel Yared, combines new age influences with modern beats that keep it interesting and emotional. The score certainly fits the film, as do the many songs.
I deeply enjoyed ""City of Angels."" This is a movie that I can sit through and not have to worry about bashing: it has all the classical elements of a romance with a new twist, which is carried out meticulously by superb acting and a tremendous directorial effort. This is the best supernatural romance since ""Ghost.""",988156800,3,5171,4.740288568257491

6040021,3,B00FYPEEFS,"""All God's angels come to us disguised...."" -James Russell Lowell

When we think of angels, we think of light, power, comfort, healing, goodness, wisdom, loveliness and protection. We think of celestial beings who we think of with wonder.

In this movie the angels are much more human, in fact, Nicolas Cage chooses to become human and gives up his immortality in order to be with his true love.

This movie is terribly romantic and is a real tear jerker. The ending shows how wonderful it is to be human and to be alive.

This movie is SO sad! Women will love it. I watched it with two girlfriends and we were all passing around the box of tissues!

~The Rebecca Review",984009600,2,808,4.5
6040022,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Nicolas Cage is superb as an angel named Seth who suddenly finds himself guarding Dr Maggie Rice(Meg Ryan) from when her daughter dies in the film's opening scenes. From then on he finds himself drawn closer to the point of sacrificing his immortality to spend the rest of his life with her. Will he or won't he? I saw the UK version of this DVD with my wife and we were both very impressed. In spite of a predictable ending, the journey there is a visual delight, with unseen angels walking atop city skyscrapers, taking a break atop freeway bridges, all in a very surreal but spectacular fashion. The cinematography, with the aerial shots, is excellent, a show in itself. And the story is thought-provoking at times - just what will one sacrifice for true love? This is definitely one of Cage's best movies, much better than recent efforts such as BRINGING OUT THE DEAD and the dreadful SNAKE EYES.",982108800,,900,4.63125
6040023,4,B00FYPEEFS,"His name is Seth; he knows neither pain nor fear, hears music in the sunset and is eternal.  Though he lacks the capacity to employ olfactory and physical senses, he knows our world, but is not of it.  And he is but one of many whose presence is manifested in the beautifully lyrical film, ""City Of Angels,"" directed by Brad Silberling and starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.  Seth (Cage) is an angel, one of an infinite number of angels with the singular purpose of presiding over the living; helping with a decision, intervening when necessary and facilitating and easing the moment of transition from life in this world to that of the afterlife.  All of which is established in a poignant opening scene, wonderfully presented, in which Seth appears to a little girl who is about to expire in the ER.  He watches and waits, and when it is time she goes to him, leaving her body behind and, reassured by his benevolent presence, accompanies him as he escorts her to her new place.  It's a moment of sadness and joy combined, and it plays out at a deliberate pace that casts an aura of serenity as Seth quietly addresses the concerns of his ward, explaining that it will be hard for her mother at first, but that eventually she will understand and accept what has happened.  It's a tranquil moment that sets the mood for the entire film, and as the scene ends, with Seth and the little girl walking away, hand in hand, he asks her what it was she liked the best; and as she answers, the scene fades.  A good director will let you know in the first few minutes of a film what to expect from what follows, and Silberling, with this adaptation of Wim Wenders' ""Wings Of Desire"" has done just that.  From the opening scene right up to the end, this film maintains a sense of peace, even as it explores the complexities of the modern world and those who dwell therein.  It's a thought-provoking fantasy that examines the nature of angels, but more than that, offers an expanded perspective of the nature of the world in which we live.  Through Seth we must ponder an existence that affords everything, including immortality, yet at the same time denies everything; an existence that affords the essence of love but denies the actual experience of knowing and having real love, as mortals do.  And what of the price one must pay to know that kind of love?  What is one willing to sacrifice?  It's a film that, beyond the romantic aspects of the cohesive storyline, poses questions and considerations about the very nature of the lives we lead, day in and day out; what it all means and where it's taking us.  And about the decisions we must make along the way, and the consequences thereof.  If ever a perfect call was made in casting an actor for a role, it was casting Nicolas Cage as Seth; he has a natural expression that utterly captures the essence of the character, and Silberling uses it to optimum advantage.  Cage fairly implodes into Seth, lending the character a depth that resonates with nuance and emotion.  The subtle restraint he uses serves to ignite an ethereal sense of life, of ""being,"" that so succinctly defines his true nature, the benevolence he personifies.  It's a giving, compassionate performance that is truly transporting, and the most significant factor in the success of the film.  Another important factor as well, is Meg Ryan's performance as Dr. Maggie Rice, in whom she imbues a strength that ultimately garners the sympathy through which the necessary connection with the audience is made.  And that connection is a pivotal point, ultimately upon which the overall success of the film depends, and she delivers faultlessly.  In a supporting role, Dennis Franz does a memorable turn as the likeable Nathaniel Messenger, a man with a unique past from whom Seth learns an important lesson.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Andre Braugher (Cassiel), Colm Feore (Jordan), Robin Bartlett (Anne), Joanna Merlin (Teresa), Sarah Dampf (Susan) and Rhonda Dotson (Susan's Mother).  There are a multitude of rewards to be reaped from ""City Of Angels,"" among them an uplifting sense of hope and the inner calm derived thereof; but it's something to which you must open yourself up and allow entrance.  It's a film that is both entertaining and enlightening, that will take you to a place rarely visited.  It's the magic of the movies, affording you an experience you should not let pass you by.",979084800,,4417,4.71875
6040024,3,B00FYPEEFS,"Nicolas Cage deserves an Oscar for some of the funniest facial expressions you will EVER see.  City of Angels is a beautiful story about an Angel who'd rather live an isolated existence with a gorgeous doctor (Meg Ryan) than stand on Skyscrapers with a nerdy sidekick and consulate people's souls.  His self-indulging unholy fantasy is mine too.  He meets her at the hospital after  taking someone's soul to heaven.  Soon after the stalking begins.  He follows her wherever she goes and just stares at her with these intense looks of desperation and envy- as if he would do anything to be with her.  His expressions capture exactly how I feel when I meet a loving, intelligent, and sexy woman.  Meg even gets better with age.  However, his plan is worth nothing without her love in return.  One special moment occurs when she's begs him to show himself to talk to her.  She is very distraught and he just remains invisible, staring at her in this poignant condition.  Until, that is, she disrobes, when he magically appears.  It's beautiful.  He skips all the makeup junk and still gets her love.  Only an Angel could pull that one off.  Now in order to live with Meg, he must give up his wings.  His sidekick pleas for him to stay an Angel by showing him that he'd give up music every morning along the beach with other Angels.  But who wouldn't rather wake up every morning with Meg next to you?  I'd rather be human than Angel too, if I could have that.  If a guy as goofy looking as Nick gets a chance like this, he won't pass on it.  Finally the action in the cabin mimics my expressions too, if that could happen to me.  This is a funny impression of afterlife that can win most men sensitivity points if they watch it with a girlfriend or date.  However, you must hold back the laughter and talk very seriously about it.  And don't think because an Angel sees a woman as an object that you should too.

We watch the  story of an angel (Seth played by N. Cage) fall in love with a Doctor  (Maggie played by M. Ryan) of a heart surgery patient who was not supposed  to ""make it"" and doesn't.  While Maggie is trying to save her  patient, another nurse says, ""He's going."" To which she looks  dead at Seth and says ""He's not going anywhere.""  Whether she  actually sees him or not we don't know.  Seth thinks she does; this  snowballs his thinking and he begins to question his existence.
Near the  end he makes a choice after some counseling from Dennis Frantz.  ""Free  will brother,"" is his advice.  So Seth goes for it. He becomes human  and finds Maggie; they share what all humans search for and few find: a  physical connection that is so deep it transcends into the spiritual.  They  are each others' soulmates.
This movie reaches out from the screen and  captures your heart (if you still have one.  If not, it reaffirms that we  all have free will and we can choose to open our hearts to love again.) If  you have a broken heart watch how Seth deals with his; truly an  inspiration.  Remember ""some things are true whether you believe them  or not.""

This screenpaly was also approved by the original writer/director Wim Wenders. Nicolas Cage stars as Seth an angel  who falls in love with Maggie(Meg Ryan)the cardiac surgeon he  ""meets"" while taking one of her patients. This movie has a number  of enormous strengths. Firstly, the story is interesting and plausible.  Secondly, the main characters are strong, believable and played to  perfection by Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Thirdly, the cinematography is  absolutely stunning. There are some remarkable shots in this movie - there  is often little need for dialogue, as the stunning visual imagery tells the  entire story. Fourthly, the musical score is superb in complementing the  on-screen action. Screenplay by Dana Stevens who also wrote Blink, and For  Love of the Game, Directed by Brad Siberling (Casper)& Director of  Photography John Seale (The English Patient) combine to make one of the  most emotional movies that even a hardened critic cant deny will touch you  in ways that only this special film can.

6040031,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Nicholas Cage (as Seth, an angel) asks Dennis Franz (now mortal and an avowed hedonist) ""what happened?"" Franz answers ""Free will brother, free will."" This movie is in fact a celebration of free will,  which would have brought a smile to Sartre's face. Yes, it is an  overly-sappy love story, but the philosophical message is more important  than the superficial love story which is tantalizingly developed by Meg  Ryan.  To view this movie as a love story with religious overtones  is to  seriously short-change it. This movie is solely about THIS life, not the  afterlife. It is about living every moment to the fullest, and knowing that  each of us is the master (and artist/creator) of his/her own fate. The  music is great and is chosen well for the scenes.  Seth eventually  struggles with the meaning of life, even though in the back of his head he  is aware that life is absurd.  Albert Camus (pronounced Kamoo' ) wrote a  short story called ""The Myth of Sysiphus"" which details the  damnation of a mortal (Sysiphus) who must eternally roll a large rock up a  hill only to have it roll back down as a punishment for his choice to put  ""death"" in chains. Camus argues that it is impossible to punish a  person who has knowingly chosen his own fate. Hence he (triumphantly!)  writes ""I imagine Sysiphus happy.""

6040034,5,B00FYPEEFS,"""City of Angels"" is not really about angels nor is it a conventional love story.  Rather, it is a film of colors, archetypes, symbols and dreams.  It is a meticulously constructed filmplay on healing the soul, finding wholeness and spirituality within, accepting what you may not like about yourself, and integrating parts of yourself you may have hidden or put on hold for a while (especially while building a career).
Much symbolism in the film comes from mythology and early Christianity (particularly Gnosticism).  Folks who have gone through analysis -- particularly Jungian -- probably see many of the symbols and archetypes immediately.  Religious studies professors may be intrigued or intellectually chagrined by the allusions to Gnosticism.  But even those of us with such backgrounds will need to see the movie several times before all the images bubble to the surface of consciousness!
The film is heavily laden with symbolism.  It drips with it.  For me, discovering all the layers turned into a puzzle requiring Jungian-type amplification (digging into the meaning of everything). I am not, however, going to give hints to discovering the ""secret knowledge"" hidden in the film.  One must experience it oneself (a basic Gnostic belief, I have learned).
The good news -- after deconstructing this film beyond reason, I still love it.  I love the music (especially the chanting of ""Angelus"" as Seth ""falls"").  The archetypes, symbols and hidden meanings do not detract from the story.  The story remains is a thing in itself-- a unity.  The hidden content does not change the meanings either, but rather allows the viewer a (separate) deeper understanding of human relationships and the healing of the soul.
I recommend this film to psychology and religious studies professors, who could challenge students to find the Gnostic Christian, mythological and Jungian content.
By the way, a deeply Christian viewer need not fear watching the film because of the Gnostic symbolism.  The screenwriter(s) clearly place their interpretation of Gnosticism within monotheism and Godliness.  There is no evil (no Satan)-- only the shadow figure which all humans carry within.
 Maggie is not the reason Seth has ""fallen."" Both Seth and Maggie are incomplete human beings. They fall in love -- a very magical, profound love -- as mirror images of hidden parts of themselves.  At the end, we see that Maggie integrates Seth-ness into herself, and Seth integrates Maggie-ness into himself.  And, not to spoil your own journey of discovery, I will leave it at that.
This is a very profound film.  Unfortunately it was beyond the critics and everyone else who knights and awards great films.",956620800,7,2684,5.173611111111111
6040035,5,B00FYPEEFS,"""Did you ever get the feeling that there's something bigger out there, bigger than you?""
'City of Angels'is about an angel who 'falls' in love with a 'human', but is bigger than that. Director Brad  Silberling creates a movie about the essence of life. His tools are Academy  Award winning director of photography, John Sealeand composer Gaberial  Yared to score the movie. Enhancing this movie are two American icons,  Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan and a Grammy rich soundtrack which features;  Alanis Morrissette (Uninvited), Sarah McLachlan (Angel),Paula Cole (Feelin'  Love), Jimi Hendrix (Red House) and the Goo Goo Dolls (Iris).
The  celestial love story begins when Seth, Nicolas Cage, the angel, comes to  claim the life of a heart patient. Maggie Rice, Meg Ryan, is the patient's  doctor. There sult of this loss to Maggie is devastating. She begins to  question life itself, ""We fight for people's lives...don't you ever  wonder who it is we're fighting with?"" Witnessing her heartache, Seth  tries to comfort,console and heel Maggie, but he too begins to question  things. ""She looked right at me."" He tells his friend Casiel.  Leading us to believe he sees more in Maggie than her pain.
Lovely lines  of dialog exchange between Seth and Maggie throughout the movie, but few  more powerful than their first meeting.
""Are you a  visitor?""says Maggie.  ""Yes.""  ""Well, visiting hours  are over.""  ""Why do they have that?""  Seth asks.  ""What? Hours?""  ""Doesn't it help the patient to be  visited?""  ""Are you in despair?""Seth.  ""I lost a  patient.""  ""You did everything you could?""  ""People  die."" Seth  ""Not on my table.""  ""People die when their  bodies give out.""  ""It's my job to keep them from giving out, or  what am I doing here?""  ""It wasn't your fault, Maggie.""  ""I wanted him to live!""  ""He is living, jus tnot the way  that you think.""
 In Seth's attempt to help Maggie he creates a  confusing mess of feelings for her and himself. No spoilers here, but this  love story makes us think and wonder. 'City of Angels' is complete and  feels like home. Like many things in life that we take for granted... Seth  discovers, a sigh, a flower, blood, love and breath. Like a child they are  all new to him and they are for a brief moment new to us as well.
Also,  like much of life we are always searching and questioning. Seth believes he  has found love and has a to choose between God and Life as a mortal. What  are your soul searching questions? This movie makes you ask yourself that  question.
Through powerfully tuned cinematography and a deeply moving  score, City of Angels, the film, is allowed to whisper in your ear. Listen  to the rich dialog, harmonious character interaction and robust story  telling. It does it with wit and charm. Once seen and heard you will never  forget it.
This brings to mind what I believe sums up 'City of Angels'  to me, emotion means the movement of the mind brought on by something which  affects it...

6040042,3,B00FYPEEFS,"The plot of this movie is great...a doctor, an angel...a love story that surpasses mortality.  However, the choice of actors made it unbelievable.  Cold, hard, criminalistic, and very fake, Nicholas Cage is no angel.  Cutsie Meg Ryan hardly makes a realistic surgeon.  Trying a little hard to  be artful, the director failed in bringing it all together in a  complimentary, workable way.  Although, now that I know the story, I'm  dying to see ""Wings of Desire"" on which it was based.  It has got  to be better than this one.",947980800,,525,4.733333333333333
6040043,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I've watched this movie over and over again. Brad Silberling, the director, has done a miracle himself and he isn't even an angel, so I think. This movie will dig down and bring to surface many emotions within  you.  It's not abotu the ""which one's"" but rather ""the  how"" that intrigues me.  Usually with any given moive there is a plot,  climax, and your good old ending.  There are very few moives that can  portray many climaxes and still follow an orderley plot.  Each step of this  moive evokes a hard to express feeling which by the end will have you in  ""ah"".
  All this talk and I haven't said what the movie is  about.  In short it's about Angles overlooking us and their thoughts and  emotions about ""life"" in general.
 There are few people that  say this movie was a clone of ""Wings of desire"" which too is  about angels and was made in Germany back in 1988 or so. I personally think  that movie is on another dimention and was targeted for a much more older  and mature audiance.  In other words for people who've gone through much of  their life time and now like to sit back and reminisce about the old  days.....
 By the way ""wings of desire"" is mostly in German  and french with english subtitles which can distract some of the  monolingual viewers :)
 City of Angels on the other hand is easy for  all ages to grasp and enjoy watching and is sure to leave a great  impression on you.  So stop what you're doing call your girl/boyfriend  man/women and watch this moive.  And if you end up hating it then don't  blame me just blame it on the rain.",947548800,,1562,4.331010452961673

Even though this is being put  down as a ""chick flick"" :-) I know of a lot of guys who really  liked the movie (though they hate to admit to it, of course :-)), so don't  let yourself be discouraged by bad reviews. Instead, make the journey  yourself - follow angel Seth through his tormented journey to be with a  human - to feel, touch, smell... ""I'd rather have one touch of her  hand, one smell of her hair, one kiss of her mouth than eternity without  it. One."" Poetry in motion. Amazing. Funny. Stunning yet simple.

But he suprised me. Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan.  However if an angel fell in love America would believe it could happen if  the person was Meg Ryan. Beauty and Smarts. Do angels fall for the rest of  us?  Wonder what the angels would say? Would an angel fall for Rosanne?  Guess it depends on the angel.,945302400,,469,3.989247311827957

We both hated it, and she usually cries at these type of movies. She did  not shed a tear. It was not a long movie, but it seemed to drag forever.  You do not get emotionally involved with the characters at all. Do not buy  this, do not even watch it. There are much better things to do with your  time. BEWARE!",944697600,4,533,3.853211009174312

You can be sure that I cried all right: first, because I had paid $3.50 to rent this film, and  then when I realized how bad it was. I am a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, but I  can't stand Meg Ryan. I had hoped one would cancel the other out.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  This film was ridiculously sappy and long.  I  actually fast-forwarded through some of the conversations because they were  so dull. Plus there was no chemistry between Cage and Ryan. I was  completely unconvinced.  The saddest part of this film is that the  soundtrack is so great.  This movie does not deserve the great songs that  were placed in it.  I wish there was a law against pairing an awesome  soundtrack with a lousy movie.

If you are the guy who wants to impress your girl and show her that you got a sensitive side, get  the movie. City of Angels gives the most important lesson that many of us  never learn until the end, it is that cherish the moments of life because  they will never come again. Another aspect that this movie reveals is that  oppoisites do attract. And to all the singles out there the ladies man  suggests this video to bring the romance together.",938217600,,573,4.317757009345795
6040050,5,B00FYPEEFS,"Meg Ryan, always perfect, creates a vigil of epic permanence in this sentimental drama of one that doesn't believe so much so she makes an Angel fall in love with her. Cage, in a role as magical as Moonstruck, is simply  irresistible in this film as Seth ""Plate"". He is a guardian angel  that finds untimely, or maybe timely, romance with the incredibly poised  Ryan. In fact, I found the duo better than the Hanks-Ryan pairing in You've  Got Mail. Believable, magical, surreal, and Angelic! Like Ghost, it makes  you believe in the power of Love than really does transcend all  things!

I agree with a former viewer who says that Cage may have been the wrong casting choice. Meg Ryan, though, is near perfect in  the role.
I could do without Dennis Franz slobbering over food to show  how human he has become.. But then, being uncouth has apparently become his  forte.
I do not believe the film holds up with repeated viewing except  perhaps for the great extras on the DVD showing just how the picture was  made.",933552000,,518,4.457446808510638
6040052,5,B00FYPEEFS,"I kept reading and hearing about Wim Wender's epic German film Wings of Desire on which City of Angels is supposedly based.  So I hunted for Wings of Desire, and after months of searching found an old VHS video with  English subtitles.  Something troubled me after I viewed it(besides the  fact of the English subtitles and that the majority of the time the  ""star"" angel does most of his monologue as a soliloquy).  And  then it struck me! It was a German movie based, I believe, on a German  book. Having studied German for 4 years and being a Dutchman since birth(52  now, thank you), much of that culture's literature and art work (including  films) are very philosophical and erudite.  Watching Wings of Desire gave  me a nasty headache,  because it was hard to keep up with the depth of the  plot(which was mainly thinking), especially with the English subtitles.  City of Angels, on the other hand, was more understandable because Seth  spoke frequently to his buddy angel, so the soliloquy became a true  dialogue.  Also, the cause for Seth's unrest was introduced close to the  beginning of the movie: Meg Ryan as a very frustrated, agnostic  cardiologist.  The rest of the movie, including Seth's questions about  humanity and immortality, move along at an acceptable pace.  For depth of  plot I suggest you look at Seth when he looks at children, the dying, the  living, at Dennis Franz, who is great by the way.  You (at least I) see the  depth of plot in Seth's eyes and his attempt to touch as mortals touch.  This is not a journey into the deeply intellectual, philosophical,  ""heady"" part of us, as is Wings of Desire.  City of Angels has a  better tempo, an understandable plot, and, if you think deeply enough about  it, it leaves you with questions that only you can answer.",931219200,,1793,4.665594855305466

Wim Wenders masterpiece ""Wings of  Desire"" has been re-made.  Why not?  Gus has re-made  ""Psycho"" and I've heard Bergman's greats are under revision as  well.  Has Hollywood finally become this pathetic?  Surprise!  History has  always been written by the most underhanded and greedy.  "" Wings of  Desire"" was the upside to the only slightly less successful ""Far  Away, So Close"".  The upside, of course, is always more profitable.  With the success of the inhumane series ""Touched by an Angel"",  certain suits saw Wender's international hit as an idiot's goldmine.  The  stars are redundant.  Box-office ecstasy!  There is only a skeleton here of  the ORIGINAL, as angels and humans alike deal with more ""carnal""  concerns.
