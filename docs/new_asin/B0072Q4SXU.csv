5051957,5,B0072Q4SXU,"Cheyenne (Sean Penn) is a retired goth-rock star who finds himself with little to do in life. But when his estranged father dies, he heads to America to attend the funeral and ends up taking a trip across the country to continue his father's search for an Ex-Nazi who tormented him when he was imprisoned in Auschwitz. Along the way, Cheyenne may learn more about himself than he ever expected.

I'm not sure what I expected out of `This Must Be the Place', but in the end found it a funny and heartfelt journey. Director Poalo Sorrentino takes a slow and artful approach to shooting the film, but it never feels that way because Sean Penn is so magnetic as Cheyenne, even when he's just sitting in the kitchen staring into space, and he does an excellent job carrying the film on his shoulders, nobody does it like Sean Penn.

It's also delightfully quirky and bold in that it's just littered with things that happen out of left field, like some guy appearing in Cheyenne's truck wanting a ride to nowhere for one, and the characters talking about their life philosophies really gives you something to take away when the credits roll. If you're not the type to read into the meaning of things that happen, then no biggie, because the characters say a lot of it anyway, at least the important stuff.  `This Must Be the Place' is worth seeing, who knows, like Cheyenne, you may take something out of it by the end. It's an enriching film.",1352332800,2,1437,4.54054054054054
5051958,2,B0072Q4SXU,The story is a trifle too unbelievable.  Retired Goth Rocker goes searching for an ex-Nazi.  Sean Penn's performance is off.  I never bought any minute of this film.,1351987200,7,165,4.821428571428571
5051959,5,B0072Q4SXU,"It is a deceptively quirky and lightweight film about important issues, like the Holocaust, identity, the ability to move on with your life despite psychological trauma. In fact I have not seen another movie addressing the subject of anti-semitism and holocaust in such a skewedly clever and creative way. I watched the film twice in a cinema and loved it both times.",1349827200,6,367,4.935483870967742
5051960,3,B0072Q4SXU,"""This Must Be the Place"" is a film that refuses to be pigeon-holed. Often off-beat, unpredictable and meandering, the Italian/French/Irish film is an art-house film of which bits are better than the whole.

Sean Penn is Cheyenne, a fifty-year-old wealthy retired rock singer in Goth attire currently living in Dublin. When he hears that his father is dying, Cheyenne travels to New York City, where he learns about the tragic past of his long estranged father.

The film is most effective when focusing its oddball characters played by the capable cast including Frances McDormand and Judd Hirsch. Harry Dean Stanton (""Paris, Texas"") briefly appears as Robert Plath, a real-life pilot who invented the first wheeled suitcase. David Byrne of Talking Heads (who provides soundtrack music with Will Oldham) appears as himself. ""This Must Be the Place"" is also notable for its beautifully shot photography.

The film, however, loses its footing when it deals with more serious issues. So why does Sean Penn's character has to travel across the country to find a former Nazi SS Officer? Why does he have to be a Robert Smith-like rock singer? I suspect that director Paolo Sorrentino is not really sure of the answer. Also, I don't think Sean Penn with his heavily mannered performances is the right choice for the role of a quirky ex-rock singer.

The highlight of the whimsical and moody film is a live concert sequence by David Byrne singing the titular Talking Heads song (complete with a unique stage look). For those who enjoyed ""Stop Making Sense,"" this exciting section alone (in which you can hear the entire song) is worth the money they would pay.",1343606400,8,1653,4.956678700361011
5051961,1,B0072Q4SXU,"I was so excited about getting this motion picture because is hard to look for a theater playing it. I made an order and without comprehensible reason this delicate piece and rare collectible was planned to be delivered separately of the other items. In my order were included boxes, DVD's, Blu-Ray discs and a couple of books perfectly packed  in a carton box and in perfect conditions when they arrived.

In the other hand, This Must Be The Place were delivered in a bubble envelope and his arrival was awful. It was crushed, the booklet broken and in my bad luck i found that the zone of the disc sold on the website is restricted only for Europe.

So at the end i was unable to see anything of the movie.",1338163200,3,708,4.3893129770992365
5051962,3,B0072Q4SXU,"If you're impatient or impervious to the charms of Sean Penn, most likey you'll be unamused. On the other hand, a film whose resume also boasts Frances McDormand, Harry Dean Stanton, Judd Hirsch and a trifecta of performances (live music, a soundtrack and acting) from David Byrne deserves at least an interview.

Even so, it comes very close to blowing the interview, taking an age to answer straightforward questions, seeming distracted, needlessly self-involved and with little interest, at first, in impressing the beholder.

But it does warm up a bit.

To give some sense of both the film's glacial slowness and its self-indulgence, at its mid-point it halts for a five minute intermezzo in which David Byrne and his group perform the title song, in its entirety, live in concert. Apropos nothing, slap-bang in the middle of the film. Now it's a good song, well performed and imaginatively staged (extraordinarily staged, really), but still it is out of all context and has the effect of staunching what gentle narrative current had begun to flow.

Cheyenne (Penn) is an elderly piece of gothic jetsam, washed up from the new-wave scene of the early Eighties. He hasn't played since, yet still mopes around his Dublin castle bedecked in black and with all the boyish accoutrements a wiser man might have put away years before: Black fright wig, white face paint, red lipstick and knee high platform boots.

In other words, he resembles Robert Smith, only older. The cruel would see a flash of Bono in there too. When Cheyenne puts on his half-moon reading spectacles and distractedly blows at a Gothic lock, he even looks like Shirley Williams might, were she the lead singer of the Damned.

Cheyenne rattles around his castle with his firefighter wife Jane (McDormand) and a dog with a funnel on its head. They have an open house, in and out of which flow irregulars: a T'ai-Chi expert, a young singer toting a demo CD he wants Cheyenne to produce and Mary, an under-explained goth teenager who operates like the daughter Cheyenne and Jane never had. Mary isn't half as under-explained as her mother, though, who sits smoking in her room in a bedsit in the shadow of Aviva Stadium (which waggish locals, I gather, call the ""Palindrome""!) and staring wordlessly down the street every day. She seems to have some relation to Cheyenne, but despite having read the production notes I couldn't tell you what it is, and I defy anyone watching without them not to be totally flummoxed.

All of this passes Cheyenne by in a hazy, laconic stupor. He slurps juice through a straw and doesn't smoke, so you suppose the drugs have long since done their work. He glumly wheels his trolley to the mall, passively copping mockery and abuse as if he were carrying a cross. Which, of course, he is.

Just as we're settling into this rather surreal Irish kitchen-sink drama, we find out more about that cross. It's a cross of iron. Cheyenne's estranged father, back home in New York, is dying. He embarks, slowly (by ocean liner, of course), to see him. He arrives too late. It turns out Cheyenne is the black sheep of an observant Jewish family. His dad was an Auschwitz survivor.

At this news, you may be thinking: ""oh-oh"". I certainly was. In any case, this unexpected new plot beat graunches the gears, but is neatly lubricated by David Byrne's bravura performance.

So begins Act II: in his father's death, Cheyenne finds the purpose that has been eluding him over half his life: to cast off his cross. He decides to track down the Auschwitz guard who tormented his father.

As a plot development, given all we know about Cheyenne, this isn't just improbable: it's preposterous. But the outcome isn't half as bad (cinematically) as it could be. Cheyenne borrows a pickup and sets off into America's great interior. He has traded his shopping trolley for a wheelie suitcase but kept the gothic garb, so be under no illusions: Cheyenne still has Baggage.

The undercurrent of Lynchian weirdness in the first half of the film thereby becomes explicit - Cheyenne's meandering progress and the oddballs he meets would not be out of place in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Straight-Story/dp/B00004Z4SD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Straight Story</a>&nbsp;(in which Alvin Straight journeys across the Midwest on a lawnmower). While this film isn't half as accomplished, there are some beautiful touches and a couple of moments of excellent slapstick (one involving a speed rollerblader in Central Park is worth the price of admission alone). The photography capturing the wide-open beauty of Utah, often through a super-wide angle lens at ankle level, is often arresting.

The Nazi theme is never over-egged: it is a Macguffin of sorts, not a driving theme of the film.  The final confrontation with the ancient (and, as they go, relatively innocuous) camp guard is deftly handled. There is a startling denouement which has as much to say about the instinct for revenge as it does about the Nazi atrocities.

Penn is very good throughout as Cheyenne: a tough character to play without comic exaggeration, and it must have been challenging to Penn to hold such loosely-knit film together with such an unenergetic role. He succeeds surprisingly well.

This Must Be The Place won't blow the box office, and it is hard to see it finding unqualified critical support, but it has many bright moments and some surprisingly tender ones.

5051990,5,B0072Q4SXU,"This must be the place is another one of those truly odd vehicles that allows Sean Penn the opportunity to (1) play a very oddball character and (2) stretch the believability of his acting.  There is absolutely no doubt Mr. Penn did the latter in this movie.  Long ago you couldn't get me to watch a Sean Penn movie if I was paid.  Somewhere down the line he aged and magic happened.  He became believable to me.

This Must Be The Place encompasses the David Byrne (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talking-Heads/dp/B017OJLW1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talking Heads</a>) song of the same name and the fact this story chances locales often.  Penn plays Cheyenne, the aged, retired, semi-reclusive lead of a Goth rock group.  Years later Cheyenne still wears make-up, lipstick, black clothing and an unruly head of hair.  With his ever present rolling luggage and occasional blowing of a shock of hair in his face (see photo), Cheyenne tries to track down his father's German death camp guard.

Several supporting cast members such as Frances McDormand, Judd Hirsch, Kerry Condon (Octavia from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B003B61J7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>) and David Byrne make this a memorable way under the radar dark film.  While listed as a comedy, and it does have its funny moments, it's very hard to call this a comedy in the traditional way.

Cheyenne's journey from Ireland to New York, New Mexico and Utah allows Penn the canvas on which to paint his wonderful (motion) picture.  As I've said before, ""The older Sean Penn gets, the better he gets"".",1461456000,,1663,5.555555555555555

He looks like a horribly aged dimwit, and it wasn't due to the make-up! I mean it was painful to look at his aged, sagging face that the make-up only exaggerated. WHY did Penn keep repeatedly blowing a piece of hair in his face over & over like it was some form of ""acting""??? I think Penn just wanted to dress up as an ancient goth rock star has-been and pretend he didn't have half a brain left. But the horrific part was that the holocaust slide show scene just seemed exploitative instead of truly disturbing as it should have, because there was no real point to this whole movie!

This character mumbles and looks slightly brain damaged like Ozzy. It is a story of a strange man with a horrible past with his father and a search for a war criminal in America. An interesting plot that just never really takes off like it should.

5052077,5,B0072Q4SXU,"This film is visually stunning, creative and full of surprises.  It is an enigmatic story of a man's journey to make sense of the world and to connect with love, meaning and purpose.  The story unfolds with humor and mystery.  Sean Penn's character, Cheyenne, doesn't have quick answers.  He bears witness to all beauty and ugliness, love and evil, seeking a way to be present in the world and open to love.  His story reminded me of the personal journey that Dante wrote of in the Divine Comedy translated in to our present time.",1384819200,,530,4.595744680851064
5052078,5,B0072Q4SXU,"Sean Penn brings to life an extraordinary character in his role as Cheyenne, a retired rockstar whose past abuse of heroine has transformed him into an introverted recluse who speaks slowly, yet eloquently.  In this breakout performance, Penn materializes Cheyenne's depressive state, and illuminates the effects of a lifelong feeling that he is unloved by his estranged father.  Following his father's death, Cheyenne returns home after 30 years to pay his respects.  Cheyenne learns that his father was obsessed with hunting down the persecutor who held him captive in Auschwitz, Germany during the Holocaust.  This new knowledge affects Cheyenne profoundly, and he sets out on an adventure to avenge his father's death. Along the way, Cheyenne meets a barrage of characters who he positively affects, and in return brings out the man within that had been repressed for so many years.  ""This Must be the Place"" is a triumph in storytelling, bringing to the surface an incredible view of what it means to truly live, and how courage and selfless acts of kindness can transform the human spirit.",1383868800,,1095,5.129213483146067

character oriented film. Penn was excellent in my

5052112,5,B0072Q4SXU,"I love this film and while it may not be for everyone, I find it enjoyable and deeply meaningful. The protrayal of Cheyenne's character by Sean Penn is exceptional, shows layers of depth and surprizing contrasts. Past trauma is written viscerally in his appearance. Psychic transmission of trauma within families, from the past, creates veils of mystery not well understood by those who are most closely affected. This is his journey of facing into that mystery with pain, tenderness, humor, love and great music. Revenge or compassion wins the day? Watch and find out. This is a movie I want to own and watch again.",1375142400,2,616,4.876190476190477

5052175,5,B0072Q4SXU,"I saw this when i was browsing on netflix and instantly added it to my instant queue. I did this because, based on the cover alone, i could tell it was gonna be something else. I mean, how can you mess up a movie about Sean Penn dressing like Robert Smith??

 When I finally watched it a few weeks later I was not disappointed. Right from the start I was glued to Cheyenne (Penn's character) because of how utterly fried he is. After a while though, some character development starts to happen and I began to notice how innocent and scared he is. I think everyone has a Cheyenne side to them; that part that is afraid to grow up and longs to stay in the same place forever, so despite how eccentric the character is, you can really relate to him.

 Now I'm gonna say now that i love 80s music and culture (despite not actually experiencing it first hand), which is why I think I was so drawn to this film in the first place, so imagine how i felt when David Byrne entered the film! Not only that, but he performs ""this Must Be The Place (Naive Melody"" in it's entirety!! Hell yes, music nerd point for everyone who freaked out at this point of the film. It's filled with great music throughout though, and this is only one of the highlights.

 After that, it continues to carry on in the same dreamy, surreal manner, but not once did it bore me. Nope. Then again, I'm far from being a lover of contemporary popular films (I despise most films in the theatres and feel that people's lives are too short to be fed such bland, mindless entertainment), and that probably makes me a tad biased. The less conventional the better, I say.

 Overall, I think anyone who was interested by the cover or the plot outline will love this flick. I don't really get the criticism about it not explaining enough of the plot. What fun is sitting and watching a movie without trying to figure some stuff out for yourself?

WATCH IT.",1369440000,,1913,4.351123595505618
5052176,4,B0072Q4SXU,"A quirky character; like maybe British Fargo??? It had humor, perspective, and history. Shows yet again the acting range of Sean Penn.  if you are a Sean Penn fan,...you will enjoy this. Good ending.",1369440000,,199,4.852941176470588

5052178,1,B0072Q4SXU,I don't buy Sean Penn's character.  He seems more mentally challenged then an old rock star.  Don't know why he went in this direction.  Love his other movies.,1369094400,,159,4.607142857142857
5052179,5,B0072Q4SXU,surprisingly good movie.  not that sean penn is ever disappointing but I especially love it when his character gives make-up tips to young girls in the elevator.  will probably add a coy of this to my movie collection,1368921600,,217,4.684210526315789
5052180,1,B0072Q4SXU,"Face it, Sean Penn is a brilliant actor. His characterizations are always evocative. So when he plays an emotionally vacuous, morally repellent rock-star has-been, the brilliance of his talent leaves us watching a repellent ex rock star stumble about.

Not one of his best movies, but, not his worst either.",1368489600,,316,4.491228070175438

I might try to finish it at some point and see if it gets better....You probably just have to be in exactly the right mood to watch this one. Only certain thing is the first half of the movie was mostly filled with nothingness. Sean Penn seemed like he was just so focused on having a squeaky quiet voice and seeming spacy that he didn't do much else with the character.,1367020800,,505,4.326315789473684

The cinematographic though, with its various styles, presented an odd concept to me, I didn't know what it was trying to show despite looking beautiful in a lot of scenes..

Yet something was missing from this movie...I cant put my finger on it...
 I mean the over all theme of a man child transforming into a man after a long trip of self reflection and vengeance for a father he didn't talk to after 30 years was kind of an odd movie plot idea... also some parts weren't so much predictable but towards the end you can kind of guess the major cliche plot that this movie masks...
... The idea was there but I just cant say I loved it.... Nor can I say I strong  liked it. I'm no expert but I can tell you that this movie missed its mark. And what tried to come off as sincere and honest really (to me) came off cheesy and conceited.

5052260,3,B0072Q4SXU,"""There's something not quite right about this. I'm not sure what, but something""
We hear this phrase fairly often from the lead character Cheyenne played by Sean Penn. I wonder if they had any idea how prophetic it would become in expressing the overall feel of the film itself.

Sean Penn is one of the few actors who can literally transform himself from role to role. Changing every nuance of his speech syntax, body movement, breathing rhythms perhaps it's more than a transformation it's a metamorphosis into a new being.

I would wager that if someone who didn't know of Sean Penn were to screen say, Mystic River, Carlitos Way and The Assassination of Richard Nixon they would have no idea and nor would they believe it was the same actor in each film.

This a rare quality and I believe a natural gift that can't be learned any more than it can be taught. Lon Chaney had it and he amazed the world for decades. Today we have Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Charleze Theron and a very few others who have this remarkable and innate ability.

Mr. Penn has created an interesting and charming character in Cheyenne - and ""This Must Be The Place"" plays out  as road movie, late in life coming of age story, Father and Son introspective, Nazi hunter and love story all tied up in a very loose bow. In other words it's one rail shy of a train wreck.

With very little screen time, Frances Mcdormand who I adore reprises her role from Fargo, only this time instead of a floppy police hat she wears a floppy fire fighters hat. It's odd and disturbing - but then this movie is full of old tricks.

There's an old saying among comics ""They can't all be gems"" it's primarily used when jokes bomb. But I think all artists regardless of the medium they use are entitles to fail because it makes us treasure the moments when it all works.

It never all works here, not entirely. But Cheyenne is worth meeting and it's a performance  that rises above the less than mediocre film it's trapped in. My hunch is it should be playing for free anytime now I suggest catching it then.",1365724800,,2061,4.460106382978723

Some of it isn't clear, or perhaps it wasn't when I first watched.

He's adopted a youthful fan in Mary (Eve Hewson), who travels with him on daily errands, and he tries to set her up with a clean-cut Irish lass. Penn's Cheyenne lives off the millions he made as a musician, but he's been a recluse for years, disturbed by the suicide of a pair of youths who literally believed the dark messages of his music.

It's difficult to categorize the crazy brilliance of Penn's performance. He's a lost soul, strolling through town pulling a suitcase like the saddest of bag-ladies. There's shades of Peter Sellers' Chance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-There/dp/B000HJ38K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being There</a>, but that's not entirely right as Cheyenne has a subtle wit and is cognizant of his surroundings. He's certainly trapped by his past, applying make-up and lipstick to his weathered face in a daily ritual. We see rock stars today, decades past their prime, Osbourne, Keith Richards, Gene Simmons, sporting dyed hair, skull earrings and other Hot Topic adornments in comical attempts to maintain youthful rebellion. Penn's character is similar, encased within an emotional coma. Who among us surviving the 1980s, once immersed within subcultures, do not carry similar scars of what was and what became?

I recently strolled a downtown street of youth, a former manic haven of live-music and raves. Back then, we dressed in black and applied makeup, arriving on the scene at midnight. Today, buildings that hosted Nine Inch Nails and Siouxsie and the Banshees are locked and quiet. A few places were open, and I passed kids half my age walking the same cement blocks. What became of these friends? What was the purpose, and when was the day I finally became old? As Tolstoy once said, it's man's greatest surprise.

Okay, I suppose Penn's character is what we personally put into it, which is part of the fascination of ""This Must Be the Place."" Few actors could have played this role so effectively. With a career marked by award-winning experimentation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk/dp/B001V97Q4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carlito-s-Way/dp/B0018OFNHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carlito's Way</a>), I think it's his greatest performance. The film was directed by Paolo Sorrentino, whose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Il-Divo/dp/B0037FOXXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Il Divo</a>&nbsp;so inspired Penn that he insisted on working with him. So we have an interesting blend of European sensibilities and inspired whimsy.

Cheyenne is contacted by New York relatives and learns his father is dying. He travels to America and quietly sits next to his body, trembling hands touching him for the first time in 30 years. His father was obsessed with tracking down a Nazi war criminal who terrorized him at Auschwitz. Cheyenne asks the same question we do about Nazis, ""Aren't they all dead?"" As a matter of fact, no. The Nazi guard is evidently in his 90s, residing somewhere in the U.S.

Thus begins an unlikely road trip through the west, replete with old motels, older diners and Route 66 ambiance. As usual, it's not the destination but the journey, as Cheyenne encounters similar lost souls on his hair-blown quest. He has time to catch a Talking Heads' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-Of-Talking-Heads-US-Release/dp/B00124BNF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best Of Talking Heads (US Release)</a>) concert. As we watch the performance, we realize how well their music has aged, not to mention the grace of lead singer David Byrne (in a great cameo), with a shock of gray hair, eyes sparkling, as alive as youth. In a memorable scene, Cheyenne discusses his fateful frustrations with Byrne, confessing the Talking Heads' music was true art while his own work was simply ""pop."" This is not the revelations of 1980's music per se. It is a moment's exposure of a man drowning in a monumental mid-life crisis.

One of the final scenes shows an elderly man walking nude across a desolate field of snow. Like Cheyenne, he's lost in a Roman wilderness of pain. Penn's character smiles in realization, knowing full well this is his fate if he does not make peace with tragic misfortunes. He must shed the skin of his past, and leave that suitcase behind.",1363392000,,5409,6.064052287581699

I guess I was waiting for something to really happen that would reinforce why I purchased the movie in the first place. Sean Penn's character was boring and difficult to believe. The ending made no sense either. Conclusively, this was a very bad movie. Do not recommend.",1363305600,2,347,4.523809523809524
5052366,4,B0072Q4SXU,"Because it stars Sean Penn, my wife refused to watch this movie with me.  It's her small way of protesting his public persona.

I'm no fan of Penn either.  I won't watch a movie just because he's in it, but I also won't skip a good movie for the same reason.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a good movie.  It may be slow moving and have certain plot turns open to interpretation, but the story and, in particular, Penn's performance are engrossing.

The actor plays ""Cheyenne,"" a legendary Goth rock star, retired for twenty years and living well on royalties and investments in Dublin with his wife of thirty-five years (Frances McDormand), a firefighter.  Cheyenne is like a lost child, who continues to wear his odd Goth make-up daily.

When he learns that his long estranged father is dying, he travels to New York, but arrives too late to see the man, an Orthodox Jew who was persecuted during World War II by a Nazi guard, now hiding in the United States.  Following the funeral, Cheyenne embarks on a search to find and take revenge on the guard who humiliated his father; a journey of self-awakening that will alter his entire life.

Directed and co-written  (with Umberto Contarello) by Paolo Sorrentino, THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is gloriously photographed by Luca Bigazzi, and features an superb supporting cast, including Judd Hirsch, Eve Hewson, Kerry Condon, Joyce Van Patten, Harry Dean Stanton and David Byrne (as himself).

5052367,4,B0072Q4SXU,"An interesting take by an Italian director (Paolo Sorrentino) on the aging of a Rock Star.  Fictional rocker named Cheyenne (played by Sean Penn) had made a career of singing very poignant but very depressing songs. Now he's retired in a palatial but largely empty estate in Ireland. How to understand a life like his? Was he basically an aging generic formerly hedonistic Rock God? Or was he always simply a tormented soul with a story (like a lot of other artists and musicians across the ages)? Honestly, I scratch my head and just find the film to have a very interesting European/Continental perspective.",1363046400,,609,4.855769230769231
5052368,4,B0072Q4SXU,"When I saw the trailer for this movie a while back, it gave the impression that this movie would be about an aging Goth rock star who is hunting down a Nazi war criminal. I finally had a chance to see the movie this weekend in the theatre here in Cincinnati, and was in for quite the surprise.

""This Must Be the Place"" (2011 release; 118 min.) introduces us to Cheyenne (played by Sean Penn), who has retired in Dublin from the music business for years but still dresses exactly as he did when performing 25-30 years ago (Penn is made up to look exactly like Robert Smith of the Cure). Cheyenne slowly wanders around the house. often aimlessly (think Ozzy Osbourne from the MTV reality show The Osbournes), with his still-doting wife of 35 years, Jane (played by Francis McDormand), close by. Cheyenne realizes that life is passing him by and hence decides to visit his father, whom he has not seen in decades. Cheyenne travels to New York (by boat as he has fear of flying, as we learn) but sadly he arrives just as his dad had passed away. Cheyenne learns that his dad was tormented for years by the memories of WWII, and in particluar the Nazi war criminal who humiliated and mistreated him. Cheyenne finds out that the war criminal now lives an ordinary life somewhere in the US, and decides to track him down. At this point (about 45 min. into the movie), this becomes an American road movie, plain and simple, as we see Cheyenne go to places in Michigan, New Mexico and Utah. Will Cheyenne find the Nazi war criminal? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is an Italian-French-Irish co-production, and even though the movie plays for the most part in the US, it feels very European. I can just see the director and producers saying ""wouldn't it be cool to get Judd Hirsch and Harry Dean Stanton in small roles for this? And while we're at it, let's see if we can convince David Byrne of the Talking Heads to contribute the musical score for the movie, and of course also one Talking Heads song."" Which they were all able to do, incidentally. And titled the movie after that Talking Heads song, even though there seemingly is no connection between the song and the movie at all. Sean Penn's performance is... strange. I think it was a big mistake to make him look exactly like Robert Smith, as it simply impedes on Penn's ability to do much with the character. But all that said, there were certain parts of the movie which I really liked, in particular when Cheyenne is in New Mexico and Utah. Bottom line: the movie was very different from what the trailer made me believe it would be, so beware of that. I wouldn't call this a terrific film, but it certainly isn't ""bad"" either. It's somewhere in between those extremes.",1355011200,,2833,4.52046783625731

8508994,5,B0072Q4SXU,"Actually, I think this is a 4+ star movie, especially compared to the subsequent films by the same director, and I am giving it 5 stars only to bring its average review rating here closer to what I think it deserves.

The good: This movie, like the rest of the films by Paolo Sorrentino, explores how it should feel being a wealthily retired ex-superstar with no aspirations or desires left to live for, who at the same time is smart enough to realise that even those past achievements and acclaim largely stayed in that past and have probably had almost a zero effect on the world. The movie is relatively slow paced and is a pleasantly warm watch. The cinematography is beautiful and the sound/BGM is fantastic. If you happen to have a good screen and a good sound system, you will definitely enjoy this movie all the more.

My only criticism is that although this movie is clearly made a bit surreal by design, some features are just too unreal: it is simply impossible to imagine how the protagonist, with his character and voice, could have been a successful stage performer in the past. Even with all the things you gradually learn about the reasons for his retirement etc, it is still difficult to unwind this character back to something even remotely resembling a rock superstar. His hearty, active wife being ostensibly happy in her marriage with this depressed person for so many years is another thing which feels too unreal and does not seem to be required at all by the plot.

Overall I liked this movie very much, but not quite as much as the other two movies of the same director that I've seen: ""La grande bellezza"" and ""Youth"". If you haven't watched them yet then I would recommend considering them first. These are his later movies exploring exactly the same theme, but which are free from the mentioned narrative abnormalities.",1523577600,,1847,4.676923076923077
