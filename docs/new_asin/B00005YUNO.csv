1676767,4,B00005YUNO,"Once again Charles Bronson plays the role of the hero. The lead

lady in the movie is played by Jill Ireland. She hires Bronson to

break her husband out of a Mexican prison. According to the movie

rhetoric,when you go to prison in Mexico you never come out again. You have to make note that Randy Quaid plays the role of

his mechanic. You also have an appearance by Robert Duvall in the

movie. He was riding high after his role in the Godfather. After

being hired by the wifw played by Jill Ireland Bronson decides

to use a helicopter to break the husband out of the Mexican

prison. The escape sequence is very exciting as well as action

packer. During this time period Bronson was making a lot of movies. This was one of them.",1102118400,2,735,4.345588235294118
1676768,5,B00005YUNO,"Being a big Charles Bronson fan, i consider this to be among one of his best movies. The usually tight lipped quite guy is actually very colorful and alive in this action packed thriller. What a great cast also that are along for the ride Robert Duvall, Jull Ireland, Randy Quaid, Sheere North and even John Houston. Also, Another great score by Jerry Goldsmith. The real winner here is Bronson's performance.
Well for the DVD? it is barebones not even a trailer and although i would have loved to see some extras on this, chances of that happening are very remote. The biggest joy is to finally have this in the widescreen format 2.35:1 after countless years of watching the lousy pan and scan versions on video and laserdisc, this is a real treat to have and a MUST own for bronson fans.",1018656000,38,789,4.524475524475524

1676791,3,B00005YUNO,"Charles Bronson was an action star.  You knew when you saw one of his movies what it was going to be.  He had been in movies since the '50s and made movies with everybody from Vincent Price to Frank Sinatra,  He started getting bigger roles in the '60s but never really became a star in the U.S until Death Wish in 1974.  Then he kept playing the tough guy and never tried to change his image like say Clint Eastwood.  So anyway despite Robert Duvall being in this also.  This is a Charles Bronson movle.  Robert Duvall is framed and goes to a Mexican prison.  Jill Ireland plays Robert Duvall's wife and she hires Charles Bronson who plays a helicopter pilot to get him out.  And that is the story.  I don't think this is one of Charles Bronson's best starring movies.  My favorite is the under rated Death Hunt.  And come to think of it most of his movies were under rated.  But this is a good one.",1480896000,,900,4.254437869822485

1676822,5,B00005YUNO,"Great Move! I was there in 1974 when the movie was being filmed. I lived near Lancaster airport and was there to watch some of the helicopter flight scenes being filmed there. We had a Cessna 120 (N89725) that had to be moved off set for the filming. I played around the hangers there when our plane was worked on. Apparently, we disrupted some of the filming when we were there and they may have had to cut a scene. Anyway, I digress..... For it's time, the movie was very well done and was an exciting prison escape movie on the big screen. Charles Bronson was at the top of his game as a very convincing actor at the time and went on to do many great movies including the Death Wish series.

1676843,5,B00005YUNO,"The mid 70s was a great period in American film especially if you liked action adventures and ""tough guy"" actors like Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, etc. Breakout has the right blend of action,plot and serious comedy. Pretty amazing cast for a mid budget movie...Robert Duvall, John Huston had a minor role. This came out during the infancy of multiplex cinemas at shopping malls and was perfect fare for taking the movie in and heading to the bookstore or grabbing a bite and reflecting on 97 minutes of good entertainment.",1443225600,,526,4.921348314606742

1676847,3,B00005YUNO,"It's OK.  I guess I'm jaded because when you know the history of some Albuquerque judges, like Neil Candelaria, Richard Knowles, Theresa Baca, Angela Jewell, and Rosemary A. Cosgrove Aguilar, it's predictable to have some judge break a lot of rules to convict someone, right down to ignoring evidence, and withholding the necessary elements of a crime, lol.  So this happening to  the character playing Robert Duvall comes as no surprise, and neither does all the corruption in the movie.  That's why half of the name of the state is  (New)  Mexico.  Things aren't all that different from ""Old"" Mexico, lol. Just a lot more English-speaking people, that's all.  Hell, and I didn't even mention the four (4) cocaine-sniffing district court judges, the one who murdered his wife and committed suicide, and the one who had to step off the bench after being accused of raping a hooker he'd been patronizing on a regular basis, lol.  Not to worry.........this is what happens in Albuquerque, NM, not the movie, lol.  That's what I mean about the movie being sort of tame.

1676850,3,B00005YUNO,"Robert Duvall's Jay Wagner is set up by his own father-in-law (John Huston, automatic movie shorthand for evil after Chinatown) because of some damaging information he has about the family business and framed for murder in Mexico.  To give you a quick idea of how corrupt the Mexican justice system is Duvall's lawyer proves beyond a doubt that his client was somewhere else when the murder was committed but the judge finds him guilty anyway.

Jay's wife Ann (the inevitable Jill Ireland) is trying to come up with a plan to help her husband escape from custody but doesn't realize things keep going wrong because the man who is helping her works for her father-in-law who doesn't want any escape plans to succeed.  Then she stumbles across a shifty pilot named Nick Colton (Bronson) who promises to do the job for no money up front--and who is also suspicious enough not to reveal the specifics of his plan until the last minute.

If you're a Bronson fan Breakout has a lot going for it.  It's not directed by Michael Winner or J. Lee Thompson which immediately represents a big plus.  Charles Bronson was at least as good of an actor as Clint Eastwood, probably better, but Eastwood was much smarter, producing and directing his own projects while Bronson worked strictly as an actor for hire.  The two things that hurt Charles Bronson's career were that he too frequently worked with Michael Winner or J Lee Thompson and that he almost always gave wife Jill Ireland the lead role in his films.  Jill Ireland likely wouldn't have had any acting career at all if not for her too loyal husband--more often than not she was a terrible lead.  Breakout actually features one of her more effective performances.

The script allows Bronson to have a bit more fun than usual--this time out he's not a grim vigilante or renegade cop--he's a pilot running various scams to try and stay afloat.  Bronson's Colton wants to rescue Wagner from that Mexican prison mainly because nobody believes he can do it.  The plan he comes up with is not only daring but also largely avoids violence and bloodshed which definitely makes this a different kind of Bronson film.

Breakout takes some unfortunate shortcuts storytelling wise.  We never find out exactly what it was that Robert Duvall's character found out that earned him the murder frame in the first place.  The movie also glosses over what happens to him after the escape--his father-in-law is the one who set him up so it's not like his troubles are over after Bronson gets him out.

Breakout still qualifies as an unusually light and fun Bronson film.  Randy Quaid provides the buddy comedy; Jill Ireland isn't terrible and Robert Duvall generates some actual drama as you see him deteriorate physically and lose hope.  Tom Gries who directed another above average Bronson vehicle, Breakheart Pass, does a nice job with his actors and the action--it's a shame he and Bronson didn't get more opportunities to work together but Gries died just two years after Breakout was made.  Considering how much better Breakout and Breakheart Pass are than the J Lee Thompson vehicles (Thompson directed St. Ives and The White Buffalo in roughly the same period) it's not hard to suppose that a lot of Bronson's 1980's films at Cannon might have turned out better with Tom Gries behind the camera instead of the perpetually uninspired J Lee Thompson whose direction usually turns movie watching into a chore.

By my count Charles Bronson made 9 films with J Lee Thompson and 6 with Michael Winner while making only one film each with the far more talented Don Siegel and Walter Hill.  How much better might Charles Bronson's movie career have been if he had simply worked with better directors more often and not given wife Jill Ireland lead roles that she was generally ill-equipped to play?

Breakout isn't likely to have much appeal for people who aren't already fans but if you like Charles Bronson it definitely beats watching Love and Bullets and The Evil That Men Do and the seemingly never-ending Death Wish sequels.",1427760000,4,4055,4.812680115273775

1676921,3,B00005YUNO,"When wealthy American Jay Wagner (Robert Duvall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Elite/dp/0792840453/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Elite</a>) is railroaded into a Mexican jail, his wife Ann (Jill Ireland) hires Texas based pilot Nick Colton (Charles Bronson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B00G575PD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Ives/dp/B0007VZ98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Ives</a>), to affect his rescue.

One of many films featuring the husband and wife tandem of Bronson and Ireland, Breakout is one of their better collaborations, with Chuck Bronson right at home as a shifty operator, looking to make a big score, without sticking his neck out too far.  After an initial failure, Colton concocts a plan to drop into the prison in a helicopter, and recruits a team that includes Sheree North, and Randy Quaid, to make it happen.

The narrative has some rough spots, as various details are missing, but the central story involving Colton is simple, straightforward, and mostly enjoyable, as Bronson is a nice fit in the dusty desert setting.  Based in part on actual events, Breakout was directed by action specialist Tom Gries (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glass-House/dp/B000FGFBVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glass House</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/100-Rifles/dp/B000EHSVSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">100 Rifles</a>), the creator of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rat-Patrol/dp/B0014BQR3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rat Patrol</a>.  Experienced in working in arid locations, Gries does a solid job here, delivering some commendable action scenes for the time period.

It's a great story (based loosely on real events) but it not a story very well told.  Details are shamelessly overlooked.  The entire premise is that a ""frame-up"" put Robert Duvall in a Mexican prison.  That's all we need to know and that's all we're told.  I suppose the plot development is no worse than a lot of action movies today, but the gritty, lower budget style of the 70's doesn't support it as well.  All that being said, it may be the most three-dimensional performance of Charles Bronson I've ever seen.",1386547200,,642,4.482758620689655
1676930,4,B00005YUNO,"I don't own this one but I sure remember seeing it on the big screen as a high schooler soaking up as many action double-features as I could during their golden age, the '70s. Reading from other reviewers that it comes on widescreen DVD certainly is a persuasive argument to pick it up.

I recall seeing the film along with Phase IV, the one about intelligent desert ants on the march. That film was somewhat engrossing but a little offbeat. Its biggest problem though was that it was second on the bill after Breakout which ruled the evening with its cool-dude(Bronson)-in-a-loose-mood attack on the viewer's sensibilities. Just a relaxed Bronson doing his thing and then some. Unfortunately, Robert Duvall's talents are wasted with few lines and a blatently bad toupee; Jill Ireland plays Jill Ireland, and Randy Quaid is immediately suspect in the absence of his usual scene stealing antics although he's still excellent here.

And as has been mentioned here by a few people, somebody does get it by a propeller, but it's not poorly done (it was perfect for '70s special effects). In fact, I recall it had me wanting to see a replay. With a future purchase of Breakout from Amazon, I can have just that!",1332633600,2,1206,4.76555023923445
1676931,3,B00005YUNO,"Bronson was never an actor's actor, not in the traditional sense. A squint & smile did for him what a soliloquy did for Olivier.

The prototype for the action stars of today, his real asset was his presence - the man had sheer presence. You could feel the raw energy that boiled under all those ripped muscles. If he growled at you to jump - your only recourse would've been to ask, ""How high?"".

Bronson was an honest-to-goodness badass, so any of his films can't be judged based on 'acting' per se. Rather you gauge it on how much fun you had in the viewing. And Breakout was pretty fun.

A decent action/adventure flick with one of the most outrageous on-screen death scenes you'll ever see.

In this film Bronson plays private contractor Nick Colton. His specialty: Hot Extractions. Hired by the wife of a corporate executive wrongly imprisoned in a Mexican penitentiary. Forgotten by his so-called friends and abandoned by our government, she won't leave her husband to die in a third-world craphole. His job - get him out. But not everyone is working toward the same goal.

As Nick puts together a ragtag team of hired guns and wily veterans, can they avoid the pitfalls and traps set up by behind-the-scenes forces to prevent the retrieval? And does the contract and his internal sense of honor mean that Nick has to give up the wife of the executive, whom he's fallen for?

Decent addition to the action/thriller library.

Movie Notes:

- Typically, when someone dies by way of a plane's propeller, you experience the horror in a splash of red on the blades, the plane fuselage, and/or the ground. This is the first time I can recall seeing a complete 'body' take the devastating hit. Absolutely brutal. And, to be honest, actually kind of a relief and humorous - because it's so clearly a stuffed mannequin going thru a man-sized blender. No such thing as CGI back then.

- One word of caution. And it's a curious caution. There's an off-putting scene where Bronson's character, Nick, finally expresses his love for the other man's wife. Instead of showing that moment of deep emotion by, say, caressing her cheek or touching the back of her neck - he gently grabs her throat. Now, I'm not sure what that means. I know for a fact that Bronson adored his real-life wife Jill Ireland, who plays the wife in this film. So I can only presume that was a very real, very personal interaction that we're witness to via celluloid; something very intimate that they're sharing with the audience. But if you didn't know about their off-camera relationship - the scene is pretty damn bizarre.

***I've added a scan to this product listing with a screen capture of the scene, which lasts an incredible minute and a half***

Update 4.28.13 - For reasons I'm unclear on, Amazon has eliminated the screen captured scene I mentioned above for the product listing. It's still available when selecting my account, then Customer Images. If you're interested, check it out there.

- What surprised was this plot was literally lifted for a modern reboot. The Russell Crowe/Meg Ryan flick ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Proof-of-Life/dp/B00005BCKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Proof of Life</a>"", shares the exact same storyline of Breakout.",1299801600,4,3266,4.950639853747715
1676961,5,B00005YUNO,"I love this film! I enjoy Charles' Bronson's work and I find this one to be one of his better ones. This film has action, thrills and humor. My favorite scene in the film is when his character, a licensed pilot is trying to learn how to fly a helicopter. Flying a helo and a plane are completely different, as his character quickly discovers. Interaction between his instructor, his characters disbelief at not never being able to be as good as the instructor are priceless.
This is a great film to wile away a rainy day or boring afternoon. All the cast are at their best.",1284768000,,573,4.415094339622642
1676962,4,B00005YUNO,"There are few dramas that are so much fun; few comedies that have such a taut plot.  This film was just a great outing for Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland.  Robert Duvall is miscast and underutilized as the victim of a conspiracy to falsely imprison an American in Mexico.  Bronson is hired to get him out.  Oddly enough, this unlikely scenario actually was a true story; odder still is the fact that Mexican law never considered this scenario and, thus, had no law prohibiting someone from rescuing someone from such a jail.
If you are a Bronson fan, you will defintely want this disk; it is funny, sexy, and a taut thriller, rolled into one.  If you are a Robert Duvall fan, you should seek other movies, as he was only a very minor player in the overall plot.",1274486400,4,763,4.460431654676259

1676964,5,B00005YUNO,"Bronson, the only man who could take Chuck Norris in a fight, is at his best in this one. Hilarious quotes from Bronson help make up the differences in a thin plot. If you love Bronson, you need this one.",1248652800,2,204,4.125
1676965,5,B00005YUNO,"A very good film,Bronson never made any really bad films,he did some average ones but not any terrible ones in my book. Plays a guy who runs a run down charter plane service who gets hired by Jill Ireland to break her husband out of a jail in Mexico,the husband played by Robert Duvall. I always thought they could have added in a bit more storyline into the film regarding the John Huston character who plays the father-in-law of Duvall. We know Duvall has been set up but this is never really explained to much,ie the reasoning behind it all. Still would reccommend to anyone.",1243036800,,578,4.514285714285714
1676966,5,B00005YUNO,"This is Charles Bronson at his best.  On the top.  Bronson at the top of his game with ""Breakout"".  This film also features:  Robert Duvall and Randy Quaid.  And you can all ways count on the sleazy Sheree North to throw in a little T&A fun too!  I love this film.",1221868800,,264,4.078431372549019

  A must buy for Charles Bronson fans. His real wife, Jill Ireland, is just so beautiful. Robert Duvall, Sheree North, and Randy Quaid greatly support Bronson in this ""breakout"" tale of Bronson and company rescuing Duvall from a Mexican jail, for a crime he did not commit.
  There is action, humor, action, and great tension and drama in this movie.",1200614400,12,484,6.5
1676968,3,B00005YUNO,"This isn't the best Charles Bronson film but it isn't terrible either.  The plot is simple Jill Ireland pays Charles Bronson to save her husband played by Robert Duvall from a Mexican prison.  It also needs to be noted that Robert Duvall's character was framed for murder.

After some convincing and negotiation of economics, Bronson takes the job.  The acting in this film isn't too bad either.  There is a bit of build up towards the actual ""Breakout"" in this film.  Randy Quaid also plays a nice part as Bronson's sidekick.

There is some action and Bronson even manages to get into some hand to hand combat.  Bronson also has a great sense of humor and good spirit as a man who is going to a foreign country to spring a man out of jail he has never met before.  Not to mention the fact Bronson is breaking myriad laws both domestically and internationally.  He really has a con artist/game show host quality about him.  Just remember his five hundred dollar check that he ""hasn't cashed"" for over two years.

Overall ""Breakout"" is a decent movie, not to be confused with any of Bronson's vigilant films such as Death Wish (saga) or Cannon Films of the 80s.  I would recommend a new comer of Charles Bronson to start out with any of these former films Charles Bronson did before watching ""Breakout"".

On a final note, there is a dummy used in this movie that is absolutely hilarious.  I don't know if other people get amusement out of it, but I sure do.",1199232000,2,1456,4.5038167938931295
1676969,3,B00005YUNO,"Typical Bronson actioner where he plays a gun for hire using a helicopter to get American businessman, Robert Duvall, out of a Mexican prison.  Randy Quaid plays Bronson's assistant, and Bronson's then real-life wife, Jill Ireland, plays the wife of Duvall desperate to get her husband out. Director Tom Gries also directed the highly acclaimed western, ""Will Penny"" in 1968.

Made in 1975, this was a signature Bronson film that unfortunately typecast this highly talented actor who was unusually adept at a variety of roles as his wide body of work in film and television and in both the USA and abroad would attest. After these films, Bronson would later star in the highly-successful ""Death Wish"" series of film for which he is probably most known.

This film's action sequences, especially the helicopter rescue, will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.",1153353600,7,867,5.006944444444445
1676970,4,B00005YUNO,"When BREAKOUT was released in 1975, it was shown at Jackson State Prison (Michigan).  Several days later, someone tried to break an inmate out of the prison using a helicopter.  Unlike the film it failed.  But another classic example of life imitating art.  The prisoners would have been better off trying to get an imitation of Sheree North in (the)black lingerie (sequence).  BREAKOUT is yet again another enjoyable Bronson time waster, not of the caliber of his work with Michael Winner, but still worth a look.  The Jerry Goldsmith score is first rate as expected.",1104019200,11,568,4.926315789473684
