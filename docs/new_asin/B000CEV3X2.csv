2460407,4,B000CEV3X2,"BFG was one of the biggest nights for TNA. It was their first PPV after moving to Spike TV and gained them bigger prominence. The sudden drop-out of Kevin Nash forced the entire card to be rewritten in a major way. If you're a Rhyno fan, this is THE disc to get as he does amazing work: A four-man Monster's Ball, a 10-man Gauntlet and then winning the NWA title. While it was a short reign, it was great to see him get his due and is worth remembering.

Another great bonus is the Ultimate X match. On the show, the ropes broke which threw the whole match off. However, TNA had a rematch on a prime-time special and include that rematch as an extra on the disc which gets them kudos. I just wish they'd fill the five-show gap between this and Lockdown by releasing those PPV's in stores too. Still, one of the better examples of how cool TNA is.",1138233600,,846,4.222222222222222

Four Way X-Division
Alex Shelley vs. Roderick Strong vs. Austin Aries vs. Sonjay Dutt

This was the first match of the night and was a little slow at the start. But it was one of the best matches of the night. Got the crowd ready for a fantastic evening. ***

Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger vs. Samoa Joe
I was expecting a lttle more from this match. But I have never seen Jushin Liger compete. Good showing for both men. ***

The Diamonds in the Rough (Simond Diamond, Primetime Elix Skipper, and David Young) vs. Apolo, Sonny Siaki, and Sharkboy

I don't really remember this match. But it was decent. **

Lance Hoyt vs. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown

This exceded my expectations for both men. It is hard to have a big guy fight be so good. But these two were able to pull it off. Both futures look bright for them. ***1/2

Ultimate X Match
Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentley w/Traci vs. Chris Sabin

This was a great match until the end. I don't wanna ruin what happened. But they have a re-match from the two hour iMPACT the following week which is better. *** for the first match. **** for the re-match.

NWA Tag Team Championship Match
America's Most Wanted w/ Gail Kim vs. The Naturals

Whenever you put these two teams together you are going to get a hard fought battle. Both teams delievered the goods and I was not dissapointed. ***3/4

Monster's Ball 2
Abyss w/James Mitchell vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rhino vs. Sabu

I was a little sceptical about this match. I mean with a card full of stipulations, I didn't understand the need for the hardcore rules. That and the first Monster's Ball match was a little below average. This match was way better and had some sick moves from both Jeff Hardy and Rhino. *****

Ironman Match for the X-Division Championship
""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels vs. ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles

Most say the first match from these two is better. I disagree. It is as equally good as the first. Both men once again prove why the are who they are in the X-Division. *****

10 Man Gauntlet for the Number 1 Contender

This match was added earlier in the night since Kevin Nash was un-able to compete. I am a big fan of Nash. But im glad he didn't compete. I won't tell you who is in this match, but you will be shocked at the winner and who enters the match. *****

NWA World Heavyweight Title Match

The winner of the Gauntlet face's JJ right after the previous fight. Once again I am not going to ruin who was in this match or who won. But it was a great ending to the PPV and TNA's version of Wrestlemania. *****

As far as I know the extras are the Fan Fest from the weekend and The Ultimate X re-match. This PPV is a must buy for any wrestling fan. Unless your one of the idiots who gets on here and rips TNA.

These guys deserve a lot more credit than what they get, cause when it all boils down, the fact is that these guys are great wrestlers, key word wrestler. And I'll be fair, if you are a big WWE fan, like myself, and you're looking for a breath of freash air, so-to-speak, then check these guys out every once in a while. I think it's a shame that these guys bust their ass just to be overlooked by lights, fireworks, and a WWE Champion that can't wrestle his way out of a wet paper bag. What? And to all you anti-A.J. Styles people out there, I don't care how overrated he is, you CANNOT deny that he is better than 80% of the WWE roster. And for the record Randy Orton vs. A.J. Styles would be a great match for the world title, or any title really. Anyway, you will be very happy with this dvd, so buy it now. Later.",1135814400,3,956,4.036842105263158

2460413,4,B000CEV3X2,"Now that I got this today & seen the DVD, I'll review it.

Before the PPV even starts, they show the entire pre-game show including the one match, the Raven-Larry Zbyszko-Rhino confrontation.

PreGame Show: Alex Shelley vs. Roderick Strong vs. Austin Aries vs. Sonjay Dutt - Great X division 4 way with alot of cool spots.

Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger vs. Samoa Joe - Joe had a cool entrance with the soman dancers.  Another great bout, really showcases what the X division is all about.

The Diamonds in the Rough (Simond Diamond, Elix Skipper, and David Young) vs. Apolo, Sonny Siaki, and Sharkboy - A decent six man tag but nothing really special here.

Lance Hoyt vs. Monty Brown - You would normally think a ""big man vs. big man"" match would be real slow & at times boring but not here.  This was just fast pased & high impact.  Another great match.

Team Canada (A1, Eric Young, Bobby Roode) vs. 3 Live Kru - Nice six man tag but everyone was more focused on Kip James sitting on the rampway than the actual match.

Ultimate X Match : Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentley vs. Chris Sabin - I've only seen the two Ultimate X matches on the X Division DVD and this one was better than both of those.  Unfortunally, the ""X"" at the top was malfunctioning in the last 2 minutes of the match & ruined the ending but the match was awesome before that.  You could see that everyone (wrestlers & fans) was pissed off at the ending.

Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. The Naturals - This was just a brawl all over the place.  Way better match than I expected.

Monster's Ball 2: Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rhino vs. Sabu - This reminded me of one of those wild ECW brawls.  There was weapons, one high impact move after another, and Jeff Hardy doing the highest swanton bomb I've ever seen before.  Another awesome match.

Ironman Match: X-Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles (rematch from Against All Odds) - Don't let the ""Ironman"" title fool you, it's basically then wrestling for 30 minutes before A.J. gets the only pinfall in the match 5 secs. before the time expires.  Overall, nice match but it's not better than their Against All Odds match.

10 Man Gauntlet: Samoa Joe vs. Ron Killings vs. Sabu vs. Lance Hoyt vs. Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Monty Brown vs. Rhino vs. Kip James vs. AJ Styles - Royal Rumble style match and it was good for what it was since you know everyone else (except Kip) was exhausted from their previous matches & even showed it when they were walking out to the ring.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Rhino - This match was short & sweet but you could understand why since nobody prepared to wrestle twice (or in Rhino's case 3 times) in one night.  Tons of interfearence from Jarrett's camp but Rhino pulls it out in the end.  Team 3D comes out in the end.

Bonus:

Ultimate X Rematch (from Impact special): Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentley vs. Chris Sabin - They reenforced the ""X"" so it would break this time but this match is clipped (has a commerical break) and honestly, just wasn't as good as their one at the PPV but it was still a great match.

Also in the bonus section is video from the weekend fanfest with comments from wrestlers & fans through the event on how they feel about the direction of TNA & their past history in wrestling organizations.

Overall, after the disappointing releases of Final Resolution, Against All Odds, and Destination X...TNA hits the jackpot with this DVD.  All matches from average to great & not one bad match worth skipping.  One of the top 10 wrestling PPV's/events of the year IMO.",1135209600,9,3567,4.503888024883359

TNA Bound for Glory 2005
Bound for Glory is TNA's flagship PPV, much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WrestleMania/dp/B00124ONF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WrestleMania</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starrcade/dp/B00000ICDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starrcade</a>. This is the first Bound for Glory and one of TNA's best events obtainable. If you are trying to get yourself or someone else into TNA, you need to purchase Bound for Glory 2005. The event had its lacking points, but they were quickly over. The great points of the PPV eclipse the average points. This is TNA's first PPV under Spike TV, and TNA had to deliver.

-Pre-Show-
The Pre-Show was available to every one for free. It was a 30-minute hype for the upcoming PPV. However, this Pre-Show had a couple of good points along with the endless plugging.

Sonjay Dutt VS Austin Aries VS Alex Shelley VS Roderick Strong
This is one of my favorite X-Division matches of all-time. This was not your standard four-way match, only two men were allowed to be in the ring at once. The other participants had to be tagged into the match. All men deliver sick spots and mind blowing highflying action. Get ready for dives, spins, and crashes. This match even features a sick 4-man submission cluster. This match was the perfect way to kick off this Pre-Show.
RATING- 9/10

Raven comes out later in the Pre-Show and demands to replace Kevin Nash, who unexpectedly is in the hospital, in the main event. Zbyszko, the daily manager of TNA, confronts him in the ring. This is a fantastic altercation between these two. Rhino comes out and suggests that maybe a girl has gotten into Raven's head. While that storyline would end up going nowhere, it still that sets up the mystery of the main event for tonight.

-Pay-Per-View Portion-
The Pay-Per-View portion of this event was only for those who paid their hard-earned money for it. All the advertised matches take place in this portion of Bound for Glory.

Samoa Joe VS Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger
If you are a hardcore wrestling fan, you were looking forward to this being the best match on the card. This match is not the dream match every one expected it to be though. This match is a very solid match though. Joe and Liger go back and forth for the entire match. Liger takes a huge dive to the outside onto Joe. The match is short, but served its purpose to open the paid portion of this PPV.
RATING- 8/10

The Diamonds in the Rough VS Apolo/Sonny Siaki/Shark Boy
This match is one of the lacking parts I spoke of earlier. The Diamonds in the Rough have been on a loser streak since...well, since they were formed. This is their chance to get a win and get back on track. There is some solid tag-team action and a few good moments, but this did not deserve to be on Bound for Glory.
RATING- 6/10

Monty Brown VS Lance Hoyt
I never found this feud particularly interesting. You knew who was going to come out on top. This match is a solid encounter though. There is one moment where moment tells all the fans to move. He is suggesting he is going to toss Hoyt into the crowd. He then throws Hoyt back in the ring and calls the fans stupid for moving. The closing moments of this match features several near falls. I thought this deserved its spot on Bound for Glory.
RATING- 7.5/10

3 Live Kru VS Team Canada
Here is our final bad stop of the show. How many times have we seen these two teams face off already? They have faced off too many times in my opinion. The real story behind this match is whether Kip James (Billy Gunn) would help his friend BG James (Road Dogg). The match was an average affair that could have took place on iMPACT. The ending is obvious, despite them trying to make it look the other way.
RATING- 5/10

Ultimate X Match
#1 Contender for X-Division Championship
Matt Bentley VS Chris Sabin VS Petey Williams
These men have been in a combined eight Ultimate X matches. The overflowing experience of the Ultimate X did not create a best Ultimate X match though. There are a few good spots and some fun dives, but nothing you have not seen in other Ultimate X matches. With that said, this make is still a fun highflying assault. The ending to this match, while controversial, is unique and enjoyable.
RATING- 9/10

NWA World Tag Team Championship
America's Most Wanted(c) VS The Naturals
On the previous iMPACT, America's Most Wanted used a beer bottle to recapture the NWA Tag Team Championships for the sixth time. Now America's Most Wanted and Jeff Jarrett have all the power in TNA. The Naturals head into this match at full force and start a huge brawl. Most of this match takes place on the outside of the ring. James Storm takes a sick powerbomb into the guardrail. There are some near falls near the end of the match. This brawl turns into an excellent match.
RATING- 8/10

Monsters Ball 2
Sabu VS Abyss VS Rhino VS Jeff Hardy
Monster's Ball 1 was a slight disappointment. The match was a good hardcore match, but not as brutal as everyone had hoped. Monster's Ball 2 makes up for this in full. The participants have been locked in solitary confinement without food, water, or light the past twenty-four hours. The idea is that when they come out of confinement for this match, they will be irritable and vicious. The idea is a bit silly, but the match is brutal. There are so many spots packed into this match, I do not know how to begin. I will say this; Jeff Hardy takes his biggest lunge to date. The rest of the match is brutal and spot-filled.
RATING- 9.5/10

30 Minute Ironman Match (Match of the DVD)
TNA X-Division Championship
AJ Styles(C) VS Christopher Daniels
Not only is this the longest match on the card, but it is the best match on the card. This is my favorite match ever. After there first Ironman match at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-All-Odds-2005/dp/B000BITVN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against All Odds 2005</a>, TNA decided their biggest show of the year deserved a godly match just like it. Therefore, this is Ironman 2. The psychology used to string together this Ironman Match is perfect. The control switches constantly. The first fifteen minutes are mostly wear-down moves with a few big moves. The rest of the match features power move after power move. The closing minutes are epic and will have you marking out like a little schoolgirl. If you do not love this Ironman masterpiece, you and me are going to have a talk.
RATING- 10/10

10 Man Gauntlet
# Contender for NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Considering this match was created on the spot, this turned into a great Gauntlet. The first two men starting were Samoa Joe and Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. They wrestled for two minutes before another competitor entered the match. After the third participant entered the ring, there would be one-minute intervals between the other entrants. The object was to throw the other wrestlers out of the ring. If you are the last man in the ring, you win. Joe has a couple good stand-offs during this Gauntlet. The winner, who faced Jarrett next, is a good choice.
RATING- 8/10

Special Referee- Tito Ortiz
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Jeff Jarrett(c) VS Rhino
This main event reminds me a lot of Raven VS Funk from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ECW-Barely-Legal/dp/B00005A094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ECW Barely Legal</a>. It is not a good match, but it is a great ending to the show. Rhino is dominated for a couple of minutes before getting the gore and winning it. I do not mind telling you that spoiler, because Jarrett would win the belt back two weeks later. Tito Ortiz has a very little purpose for being a part of this match. At the end of the day, this is still better than what Jarrett/Nash would have pulled off. The aftermath is fun, but expected.
RATING- 6/10

-Bonus-
The bonus section in TNA DVDs is usually a let down. Often times you will get replays of a few moves and maybe a small backstage segment. Bound for Glory 2005 is special though, and needed some fantastic extras though. They give you an Ultimate X match and a looking inside Fanfest.

Inside TNA InterAction Fanfest
Take a look inside TNA's fan show before Bound for Glory 2005. You get to hear comments from fans on how much they love TNA. You also hear a few comments from wrestlers like AJ Styles and BG James. I love the kid getting his steel chair signed by all the wrestlers.

Ultimate X Match (iMPACT, 10/05)
#1 Contender for X-Division Championship
Matt Bentley VS Chris Sabin VS Petey Williams
After the controversial ending of the Bound for Glory match, they put in place a rematch on iMPACT. This match is shorter, but still a great Ultimate X match. There are plenty of juicy spots in this one as well. This time, despite a close call, the ending is normal. There is a commercial break in the middle of the match, but it will not hurt your viewing too much.

Samoa Joe VS Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger: A good Nmatch but could have been way better.

Monty Brown VS Lance Hoyt: A basic big man match. Nothing really speical.

Chris Sabin VS Matt Bently VS Petey Williams in an Ultimate X match: While its TNA's signature match to lure fans into TNA, I thought this match sucked.

Monster's Ball Sabu VS Abyss VS Rhino VS Jeff Hardy: Hated how they kept saying the wreslters were locked away in a box for the last 24 hours with no food or water. A very short match that had a few highlights. Would have been beter if it were a few minutes longer.

AMW VS Naturals: TNA could put on great tag team action in 2005. This is one of those matches.

Christpher Daniels VS AJ Styles in a Iron Man Match: A very good match even though I hated the idea of an Iron Man match in the X-division.

10 Man Gauntlet Match: The TNA match will give you a headache if you try and understand all the rules. Kevin Nash injuried? I would have never guessed that in a million years! Nash has never been injuried before! Rhino wins. Do you think Jarrett will lose against Rhino with this much momentum in Rhino's corner?!

Rhino VS Jeff Jarrett: Again, TNA needs to work on main events. This one was short and probably a throwback to the Funk-Raven ECW match in 97. Rhino wins in the end. Probably the only thing TNA ever will give him. Dont get me wrong, Rhino is a great wrestler. He was unstopable in ECW and then WWE gave him nothing to do. TNA picked him up and give him the world title for a week or so. Now, he is just anther face in the TNA crowd. Only thing he can do well is brawl.

Overall, I don't think this was TNA's finest hour. Good matches like Monsters Ball, Iron Man Match, AMW VS Naturals but it was not perfect. The only one who would call it perfect would be Rhino.",1199923200,,1826,4.2091690544412605

1. Sonjay Dutt vs. Alex Shelly vs. Austin Aries vs. Roderick Strong in a four way X-Division match- This was a great way to kick off the show. In fact this match was free because they had so many matches on the card that you could watch this one and than decide if you wanted to order the ppv or not. Anyway this was about a 15 minute match with non stop action. There were tons of highflying moves and there were a lot of near falls. Not a lot to say but a great way to kick off the PPV. Winner Sonjay Dutt. Match Rating 8/10.

2. The Samoan Submission Machine Soma Joe vs. Jushin Thunder Liger- This was another good choice to kick off the paid part of bound for glory. Joe had just really started in TNA and had not even been in for a year and they were already counting his streak. At the time Thunder Liger seemed like he was the right one to take Joe down. This match started off great lots of fast paced action. Joe even jumped trough the ropes onto the outside. There were a lot of near falls but it ended with Joes famous chock hold. Good match. Winner Soma Joe. Match Rating 7.5/10.

3. The Diamonds in The Rough vs. Sonny Siaki, Apolo and Shark Boy- This was another solid match but was a step down from the last two. The diamonds in the rough have always been a great tag team and they showed it here ven though this seemed almost like a filler. There was just some solid tag team wrestling here. There came one part in the match were every wreslter in the match did some sort of dive to the outside which was sweet. There were a few near falls but It was a very solid match for the time given. Winner The Diamonds in The rough. Match Rating 7/10.

4. The Alpha Male Monty Brown vs. Lance Hoyt- This also seemed like a filler but it turned out to be a decent match. I am not to strong on remembering this match but monty brown did carrie this one. Not to much to say but a decent match. Winner Monty Brown. Match Rating 6.5/10.

5. The 3Live Crew vs. Team Canada- This was probably the worst match on the whole card. I have said this before I really cant stand road dog wrestling  his whole team was not that solid but this was passable. Just a solid match with Team Canada carrying this one but the turn at the end when Konan turned on 3Live Crew was perfect and it earns an extra point in my book. Winners The 3Live Crew. Match Rating 6/10.

6. Matt Bently vs. Peaty Williams vs. Chris Sabin in an ultimate X match- Now this was supposed to be a good match and it was but the match did not live up to the expectations because the x kept falling down. To start the match there was tons of action including a powerbomb from the ropes hanging up and a nice elbow drop from the top of the ropes. There were some hurricanrans to the outside of the ring and just non stop action all the way around. The X kept falling and the second time it just fell into Peaty hand. Winner Peaty Williams. Match Rating 7.5/10.

7. Americas Most Wanted vs. The Naturals for the NWA tag team titles- This was a very solid match. This was just one day after Americas Most Wanted won the belts and began there long title raign. This was a very solid match with the Naturals wating revenge. In this match to start it was just brutal. There was blood and everything including a sick powerbomb through into the steel guard rail by Americas most wanted. The Naturals kept on fighting back and there were so many near falls but than one member of The Naturals got handcuffed to the guardrail and was stuck there as his teammate got destroyed. Winners and still NWA tag team champs Americas Most Wanted. Match Rating 8/10.

8. The Monster Balls Match Jeff Hardy vs. Sabu vs. Abyss vs. Rhino- This was an absolutely brutal match and in my opinion a good contender for match of the year and I am serious when I say that. Every one in this match brought something to the table and they showed it here. There were so many weapons tons of tables, chairs, steel signs, thumbtacks, kendo sticks trash cans everything you name it. Anyway there were a lot of cool spots in the match Sabu had a lot of sweet table spots were he jumped to the outside and put Rhino through a table. One of the sweetest spots that you will ever see in wrestling was Jeff Hardy got on top of a ladder and climbed to the top of the impact zone and jumped so far across the stage and hit a Swanton Bomb on Abyss through two tables. You have to see this to believe it one of the sweetest spots you will ever see in wrestling. Rhino hit a sick gore on Abyss through a table and just a great match to watch awesome stuff right here. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 10/10.

9. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels for the X-Division title in a 30 minute iron man match- This was another great match to fallow the last one we just saw. Both men here brought every thing to the table. Two watch these two wrestle is just awesome so many high flying moves so many near falls just awesome stuff here. You might get borred in a few spots but trust me I cant really describe the match you just have to watch it a great match enjoyed by all. Winner and still X-Division Champ AJ Styles. Match Rating 9/10.

10. Abyss vs. Rhino vs. Monty Brown vs. AJ Styles vs. Ron the Truth Killings vs. Kip James vs. Samoa Joe vs. Lance Hoyt vs. Sabu vs. Jeff Hardy in a 10 man gauntlet for the number 1 contender to the NWA title- This was another solid match. This was just some fun wrestling that keeps you at the edge of your seet to just root for the guy you want to win not so much about the wrestling. A good match that was the right time and a really unpredictable match of who was going to win. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 7/10.

11. Jeff Jarret vs. Rhino for the NWA title- This match was right after the gauntlet match and it was not a classic but it was still good. Jarret controlled a lot of this match and basically played the heel role on beating rhino down after he had been in two matches. Rhino made his comback but gail kim got involved and Jarret nailed the guitar shot on rhino when he went for the gore but only got 2. Rhino hit the gore out of know were and won the title jarret looked shocked after the match the put rhino in a casket but team 3D made there return to save Rhino. A great way to end the show and a big surprise for Rhinos title win. Winner and New NWA Champ Rhino. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Bound For Glory 2005 a grade of 83.5/110 which is a 76% which means this is a perfect ppv. You Damn right it is this is one of the best ppvs I have ever watched there were 2 awsome matches tons of solid ones and not one that got below a 6 from me. Just a really great ppv. I am telling you that you need to pick this up if you can. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1176768000,,6881,4.150037509377344

2460421,5,B000CEV3X2,"This PPV is without a doubt in my top three favourite PPV's list with a stacked card from top to bottom. For weeks I looked forward to this PPV and it did not disappoint one bit. But enough chitter chatter let's get to the review which I will rate match by match out of ten.

1. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger V.S Samoa Joe

this match was very good for the time that it was given but if it went twenty minutes it would be the classic I thought it would be. Anyway very good match. 8/10

2. Diamonds In The Rough V.S Apolo,Sonny Siaki,and Sharkboy

a decent six man tag match that was kinda slow for most of the match but really picked up at the end. 6.5/10

3. Lance Hoyt V.S Monty Brown

a suprisingly good match with Lance showing how much better he is getting match by match with some cool power moves from Monty and good high flying by Lance. 7.5/10

4.3 Live Kru V.S Team Canada(A1,Eric Young,and Bobby Roode)

better than the first six man with some good wrestling moves and some pretty funny moments as well. 7/10

Ultimate X match for the #1 contender to the X-Division title

5. Petey Williams V.S Matt Bentley V.S Chris Sabin

not as good as I thought it would be but still had some pretty good spots even though the one on the two hour special was better. 7.5/10

 NWA World Tag Team Championship match

6. The Naturals V.S AMW(C)

an excellent tag team match between two of the best teams in TNA today with great showings by all involved. 8.5/10

 Monster's Ball 2 match

7. Jeff Hardy V.S Abyss V.S Sabu V.S Rhino

an unbelieveable hardcore brawl with chairs,tables,kendo sticks,weight belts,and ladders with some unbelieveable spots in this jaw dropping encounter(watch for Jeff's dive it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen). 9.5/10

 30 Minute IronMan match for the X-Division Championship

8. Christopher Daniels V.S A.J Styles(C)

amazing matchup that blended technical,high flying,and brawling wrestling with tons of near falls and cool spots with a nail biting finish to top off this classic. 10/10

 #1 contender's Gauntlet match

9.? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ? V.S ?

all of the participants are revealed only when they come out in this gauntlet where each man enters the match after a certain period of time with opponents being eliminated by going over the ropes and hitting the floor. A very good last minute match with some cool moves,good drama,and suprises. 8/10

 Main Event:NWA World Heavyweight Championship match

10.? V.S Jeff Jarrett(C)

a very good match for the time it was given with an unexpected ending,some cool moves,and Tito Ortiz is the guest referee. 8/10

Overall a great show with it's fair share of classic matches and unforgettable moments. If you don't already own this I advise you to go pick it up as soon as possible. Long Live TNA!!!",1148774400,3,2804,4.568273092369478

2460432,5,B000CEV3X2,"TNA Wrestling is way better than WWE...and if you think not then you are brained washed.  I WAS! a long time WWE fan and now have converted to TNA wrestling. The WWE is sorry. Lets look at facts the only thing we are thankful for nowdays are old school DVD releases that WWE puts out -ie. The Road Warrior, The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, ECW DVD's, Monday Night Wars and yes even I can't wait for both the NEW Dusty Rhodes & Hulk Hogan DVD collections. We boo their champion, John Cena...most cheered when Triple H told Batista he's leaving RAW...a grand ideal of the Smackdown! Juniors Division...Chloe...trying to make you think Heidenreich was a Road Warrior...and we can't forget pathetic attempts to get you to watch our program with HLA or Rated R Sex from Edge & Lite. The WWE is just sorry!  TNA Wrestling brings you top notch competition with their X Division, makes you beg for more from their ultimate Bad Guy - Jeff Jarrett, surprises at PPV, like the appearance of Scott Steiner (come on the last time we were surprised at a WWE PPV was when Paul Wight aka Big Show appeared or when Haku came back at the rumble), never failing to give it their all wrestlers - AJ Styles and Petey Williams...TNA is truly the better program.  And Bound for Glory gives you the feeling that I use to have when WWE's Wrestlemania was coming.  Wrestlemania is a joke! Are we suppose to believe Mark Henry is gonna end the Undertaker's winning streak! Are we wrestling fans to the WWE or are we idiots! Bound for Glory was the final straw and made me a TNA wrestling fan for life.  With great matches like the Monster's Ball Match, the Ultimate X Match, Styles vs. Daniels, Sonjay Dutt's performance in his match was worth any price of admission, Rhino's unpredictable title win and heck! even Monty Brown's match against Lance Hoyt (even through a filler) gave me the same goosebumps I got when watching Jimmy Snuka take on the Undertaker at WrestleMania 7. We are not stupid wrestling fans...we know this match is a filler much like the Snuka/Taker Match.  But those matches happen because they lead to greater things to come in the wrestling world. Not like the sorry Playboy Pillow Fight at this years wrestlemania. TNA is wrestling that we bring back old feelings with stars of today. And it can start with Bound for Glory with you!",1143331200,5,2333,4.596153846153846
2460433,5,B000CEV3X2,"All you people that write reviews about TNA and how it sucks compared the WWE are just sad individuals! WrestleMania is predicatble. Here is what will happen, Beniot ""the best wrestler they have"" will JOB to JBL after Stone Cold makes JBL look silly on Saturday Night Main Event. Beniot has been pinned by JBL 3 times already when The Boogie Man and Lashley have beaten JBL. The WWE is just sad compared to what it used to be. Also Undertaker obviously won't lose his WM winning streak to....Mark Henry... Triple H who's married to Stephanie will burie John Cena who he thinks is overhyped to make sure he stays the only top top WWE name. Triple H will not lose 3 WM's in a row. Rey Mysterio will become World Champ when Angle deserves to walk away as champ after putting over Cena so many times as it is. He's not married to Steph like HHH is, so of course he has to put over Cena and look weak compared to HHH.

  So anyway my point is that the WWE is just boring now. HHH gaining power by becoming a McMahon basically took the fun out of it. Every time a wrestler has power they're selfish and Triple H is no different. If you disagree just look at how he's the only heel allowed to be champ on Raw. Yeah they made Edge champ but that was just for a month! Wow that was really nice of HHH to let Edge be champ...lets give him his 11th reighn!. Anyway TNA is far far less predictable and their ppvs are way better too. Every match is good when the WWE is lucky if every match is good. TNA trys to have big surprises at every ppv, when was the last time you were surprised by a WWE ppv. When was the last time something happened that you didn't see coming ?

  The X-Divison is what WWE could do with their cruiserweights but are too boring to do. Ladder matches are super old and not as good as the Ultimate X Match. TNA is creative with their match types, WWE is rarely creative anymore. They just give you a WM mainevent tournerment on Raw and WWE fans are like...duh who's going to the mainevent ?... It's HHH...duh!, he's married to the bosses daughter and is selfish and will be in every singe Raw WM mainevent World title match until he's older than Ric Flair.

  With TNA you never really know what will happen and it's a lot less predictable. At Bound for Glory you don't know who will face Jarrett for the title, if HHH was in the battle royal and it was the WWE then yeah you know he'd win. Rhyno wins after winning a tough 4 way hardcore match and giving Jeff Hardy a nasty piledriver off the top ropes. He then gains a hard fought victory over Jarrett for the title. Jarrett may have power like HHH but at least he puts people over that were heald back and wasted in the WWE. Go back and watch Christian against people like Randy Orton, HBK, Jericho, Beniot and many other big WWE stars and tell me then that he didn't deserve to a mainevent spot.

  Also at this action packed....unpredictable ppv. A.J. Styles has another great classic iron man match with Christoper Danials. Both would be wasted big time in the WWE. The undefeated animal Samoa Joe take on Jushin Liger in a match that could've been better but still is better than any WWE cruiserweight match. The Ultimate X match here isn't really the best example of a good Ultimate X match but is still decent. Watch the Destination X 2006 one with A.J., Samoa Joe and Danials for a good example of an Ultimate X Match. Anyway listen to Christian and give TNA a chance, he's right the WWE is tired and old and TNA is the next big thing. If you aren't married to Steph or a good ass kisser you get heald back in the WWE. In TNA you get pushed because yout bust your ass. So everyone who busts their ass and gets nowhwere in the WWE should come to TNA! Checkout this TNA ppv and every TNA ppv and I doubt you can say you weren't entertained. That is if you can pull your head out of Vince's butt.",1142208000,2,3865,4.236413043478261
2460434,5,B000CEV3X2,"I bought this ppv on dvd a few weeks ago and I watched it and was very impressed with it.  Here's a list of the matches:

Jeff Jarrett vs Rhino for the NWA World title

10-Man Gauntelt to determine #1 contender: Abyss, Monty Brown, AJ Styles, Ron Killings, Kip James, Samoa Joe, Lance Hoyt, Sabu, Rhino, and Jeff Hardy

AJ Styles vs Christopher Daniles in a 30-minute Iron Man match for the X-Division Title

Matt Bentley vs Petey Williams vs Chris Sabin in Ultimate X(to determine #1 contender for the X-Division Title)

America's Most Wanted vs The Naturals for the NWA World Tag Team Titles

Samoa Joe vs Jushin Liger

Abyss vs Rhino vs Sabu vs Jeff Hardy in Monster's Ball

Monty Brown vs Lance Hoyt

3 Live Kru vs Team Canada

Sonjay Dutt vs Alex Shelley vs Austin Aries vs Roderick Strong

Diamonds in The Rough vs Sonny Siaki, Apolo, and Shark Boy

The best matches on this ppv were Monster's Ball 2(Jeff Hardy does an insane swanton bomb from the top of the stage through a table to the floor on Abyss!  It's the craziest thing I've seen him do since his stuff in the ladder and TLC matches in WWF), Ultimate X, and the X-Division 4 way.

Buy this dvd, you won't be disappointed",1142121600,,1186,4.400921658986175
2460435,5,B000CEV3X2,"First, all the WWE and TNA bashing in the reviews has to stop.  Let people decide on their own if they would rather watch TNA, WWE, puro, or indies.  God forbid if they decide they enjoy watching it all.

As for the DVD, I think TNA did great with the Bound For Glory release.  I loved how the preshow was included, and the Ultimate X rematch as an extra makes this have the second best extras on a TNA DVD, second only to Lockdown's Candido tribute.  However, I don't think TNA is on WWE's level in DVD production yet(even with WWE's extensive library aside), since TNA says Rhino wins the title on the packaging.  It ruins it for someone who bought the DVD blindly, and may have never heard of TNA before.  Also, not having an insert makes the DVD feel really indy.  Not a huge gripe, but not a great thing for a wrestling company that is #2 in the US.

Alex Shelley vs Sonjay Dutt vs Austin Aries vs Roderick Strong- great opener, really popped the crowd huge.  Amazing moves were pulled out, it was good to let the new guys in TNA show what they had. 9/10

Jushin 'Thunder' Liger vs Samoa Joe- Good match, should have been better.  Liger is probably the best Japanese wrestler of all time, but is only given an 8 min match.  A little disappointing, but these 2 made the most of it. 8/10

Shark Boy, Sonny Siaki and Apolo vs Diamonds in the Rough- I was glad to see Skipper and Shark Boy on the PPV.  That's really about it, though.  This wasn't by any means a bad match, but should be on the pre-show to give Joe and Liger more time. 6/10

Monty Brown vs Lance Hoyt- This is a lot better than I would expect it to be.  I'm not really a fan of either of these guys, but they meshed pretty well together. 7/10

3 Live Kru vs Team Canada- Matches like this make you feel bad for Ron Killings, Bobby Roode and Eric Young.  Those 3 have boat loads of talent, but are having to be in there with washed up guys (Konnan, BG) and a ridiculous hoss (A1).  Probably the worst match on the DVD, but not a dud. 5/10

Ultimate X: Matt Bentley vs Petey Williams vs Chris Sabin- A very good match that is ruined by the X falling.  It doesn't totally ruin the match, and Petey's praying for the X to fall is hilarious.  The rematch as an extra makes up for the malfunction. 7/10

America's Most Wanted vs The Naturals:  Pretty good tag match.  These teams work really well together, and thier history really shows in this match.  7/10

Monster's Ball: Rhino vs Jeff Hardy vs Abyss vs Sabu- Crazy match.  Each guy takes insane bumps, and really goes beyond the call of duty by competing in the gauntlet later that night.  Even if the match didn't work amazingly well (which it did), you gotta respect each guys work in it. 9/10

Ironman: Christopher Daniels vs AJ Styles- Two of the best in the world going for a half hour, and giving a very dramatic finish to the match.  What else could someone want. 9.5/10

Gauntlet for the #1 Contendership- Nothing extraordinary here, but not bad by any means.  It did what it had to, and also made Samoa Joe look like a threat to the heavyweight division. 8/10

Jeff Jarrett vs Rhino- This match is short, but it was also Rhino's 3rd match of the night.  Tito Ortiz as the special ref didn't really come into play, he just took Gail Kim from ringside.  This was good for what it was.  7/10",1140652800,,3315,4.276972624798712

In the end rhino wins the world title...give me a break a stalky loser ....a guy that could only win the hard core title in wwe...and u will say becuz vince wouldnt give him a push...well ur right and it was for good reason...rhino is nothing more than a open match guy...This pay per view sucked ..I would suggest summerslam 2005 or royal rumble 2006...buy Wresltemania 22 when we see vince vs. Micheals and HHH vs. Cena",1140048000,,723,4.355555555555555
2460437,5,B000CEV3X2,"WOW what an amazing event!

This was a big PPV for TNA and they put everything on this show and it was one of the best PPVs i have seen in a while.

International Showdown

Samoa Joe Vs. Jushin Thunder Liger - What a brilliant opener, Joe could be the future of TNA. This match was quick but very enjoyable. Liger manages to get in some high flying but is overpowered by Joe and beaten by the muscle buster to keep the winning streak alive. 8.5/10

6 Man Tag

Diamonds In The Rough Vs. Apolo, Shark Boy & Sonny Siaka - I didn't really like this match though it had some good moves. i Think that Skipper should be in singles action and Siaka and Apolo don't really interest me. Decent tag match. 7/10

Monty Brown Vs. Lance Hoyt - A battle of the big men, this was another good match better than i could have expected. Hoyt uses some flying moves and this is a good battle with Brown winning with the POUNCE. 8/10

Team Canada Vs. 3LK - Different type of tag match and good battle with Kip James as referee. 7/10

Ultimate X (Winner gets X Title shot)

Petey Williams Vs. Matt Bentley Vs. Chris Sabin - This match was dissapointing it had so much potential but the malfuncture really ruined this match for me along with the bad finish which was spare of the moment. All 3 try hard but better watch Destination X or Final Resolution for better Ultimate X matches. 7.5/10 (For effort of 3 guys)

NWA Tag team Titles

AMW (c) With Gail Kim Vs. The Naturals - I love both AMW and The Naturals and they have had some classic tag matches before. AMW had just won the tag titles and this was the rematch, brilliant tag action and a decent ending with AMW retaining. 9/10

Monsters Ball 2

Jeff Hardy Vs. Rhino Vs. Sabu Vs. Abyss - WOW!!!!! Match of the night and year what a showstealer. I wanted Abyss to win (favourite wrestler in TNA) but it was not meant to be. Great action as weapons and tables are used throughout (never saw tacks which let it down abit ). Really exciting match which crowd was really into, look out for: Sabu and Rhino table spot - Swanton from balcony!! and Rhino driver from top rope. BRILLIANT!!!!! 10/10

30 Min Iron Man Match (X Title)

AJ Styles (c) Vs. Fallen Angel - Another brilliant match only beaten by Monsters Ball. Very technical affair including some great high flying spots and action right up to finish. Look out for AJ hurting leg on steps OUCH. 10/10

Battle Royale (NWA Title Shot)

Ron 'Truth' Killings Vs. Sabu Vs. Lance Hoyt Vs. AJ Styles VS. Jeff Hardy Vs. Kip James Vs. Abyss Vs. Monty Brown Vs. Samoa Joe Vs. Rhino - Decent enough considering it was improntu because of Nash not being cleared, a good battle royale considering alot of wrestlers had been in matches. 7/10

NWA Title

Jeff Jarrett (c) Vs. Rhino - Short but understandle because of Rhinos battle in Monsters Ball. Some good moves and brilliant ending as Jarrett is dethroned. Great bit with Team 3D, AMW and Team Canada at end. 9/10",1140048000,5,2939,4.379373848987108
2460438,5,B000CEV3X2,"TNA's epic PPV, Bound For Glory took place on October 23, 2005. I watched it on ppv with my friend and we couldn't believe what some of these matches delivered. In this epic the entire crowd of fans really helped bring the atmosphere at an all time high as the superstars of TNA came together Bound For Glory....

Samoa Joe vs. Jushin Thunder Liger:

Pretty good way to start off the night. Samoa Joe comes to the ring dancing in style with Samoan tribesmen complete with dance attire. The match itself was back and forth action. Jushin used a lot of high flying moves such as a cross body off the tope rope onto Joe on the outside of the ring. In the end Samoa Joe used his muscle buster on Liger for the win. 8/10 [good match but short]

Monty Brown vs. Lance Hoyt:

Two big men met as strength and power met strength and power. Lance Hoyt actually uses some high flying moves in this match, but the pounce claims anyone as a victim as Brown pounces Hoyt to get the win. 7/10

Ultimate X Match

Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams vs. Matt Bently:

Okay Ultimate X match, but the thing that brought the match down was that the red x that the superstars had to pull down in order to win actually fell down not once but twice! Some high flying action but the ending is cheap as Petey wins after catching the X as it fell for the second time. 8.5/10

Monster's Ball Match

Sabu vs. Abyss vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Rhino:

Great match. Absolutely amazing as 5 or 6 tables are broken and a lot of weapons are used. Chairs, kendo sticks, and trash cans make appearances. Highlights include: Jeff Hardy going back to his old WWE days by giving a HUGE Swanton Bomb off a balcony that must have been at least 25 feet high right on top of Abyss through two tables. Sabu gets put through a table chest first, and Abyss gets gored through another table. Rhino wins after giving Jeff Hardy a piledriver off the second rope. 9.5/10 [Again, a short match that should have had at least 6 more minutes in it.]

NWA World Tag Team Championship

America's Most Wanted [Champions] vs. The Naturals:

Great tag team match. TNA has an abundance of tag teams and I personally thought the Naturals would win it. However Gail Kim and AMW used dirty handed tactics to ensure that AMW walked out with the gold. Good tag team match. 8/10

X Division Championship

30 Minute Iron Man Match

Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Stlyes [Champion]:

Excellent Wrestling Match. Sort of like the modern day version of Bret Hart/HBK iron man match. Lots of submission holds, counter holds, and high flying moves by both men. Watch a VERY close count after Daniels hits the BME [Best Moonsault Ever] Other highlights include AJ jumping on top of the steel steps right onto Daniels in the crowd. Watch AJ fall out of the ring and land hard and painfully on the steel steps. The ending comes with 10 seconds left and AJ hitting the Styles Clash for the only pinfall of the entire match for the win. 10/10

10 Man Gauntlet Match

#1 Contendership goes to the winner:

Okay Gauntlet match. This was a last minute deal as Kevin Nash was supposed to compete against Jarret but couldn't at the last minute. Wrestlers included: Sabu, Abyss, Samoa Joe, Jeff Hardy, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Ron Killings, Rhino, AJ Styles, and Kip James. In the end Rhino gets the win after goring Abyss and throwing him over the top rope. 8/10

NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match

Jeff Jarret [Champion] vs. Rhino:

Really short main event. Highlights include Gail Kim distracting the special guest ref, Tito Ortiz, so Jarret could smash Rhino extremely hard with a guitar, but Rhino kicked out. AMW would hit the ring but the 3LK came in and helped Rhino hit the gore on Jarret for the win. 8/10 [Exciting finish, but WAAAAAAY to short]

After the match Jarret, Team Canada, and AMW try to force Rhino into a casket, only to have the Team 3D aka The Dudley Boyz, hit the ring and turn the tide and force the heels to run away.

Other matches include:

Team Canada vs. The 3LK

Apolo, Sunny Siaki, and Shark Boy vs. The Diamonds in the Ruff

And a bonus match from Impact of the Ultimate X rematch as Petey Williams gets the win.

2460439,5,B000CEV3X2,"Bound for Glory was very kick ass. The X-divison matches, will take your breath away.  TNA is filled with guys who can fly and they do it with style.  Monsters Ball alone, is worth it to you buy this dvd.  Sabu, Jeff Hardy, Abyss and Rhino all put it on the line. Jeff Hardy was lucky not to break his neck. Trust me this dvd is worth your money.

 The Fallen Angel and Styles was a really good match. The only fault was that after seeing the Ultimate X match. Is that it feels slow and you want more fast action in it.  It would have been better to have Daniles and Styles before that. But if you like great chain wrestling this will make you smile.

 The first iron man match over all was better, and was more like you would think it should be the whole 30 minutes.  But the last part of the match is worth waiting for. The rest of the card was great, I felt my money was very well spent.  If your looking for real wrestling and are sick of crap. TNA is worth your time and money.

8098239,4,B000CEV3X2,"Lately, I've been buying old TNA PPV's on DVD just to see what they were because I kept hearing how good the action used to be before a few years ago. So, I took a chance and bought TNA's Bound For Glory 2005 and it wasn't a waste of money at all! No match on here was worse than 3 stars and there are a few MUST VIEW's on this one! Let's get to the matches:

Sonjay Dutt Vs. Alex Shelley Vs. Austin Aries Vs. Roderick Strong (X-Division Four Way Match) - This match takes place during the 30 minute preview leading into the actual PPV. In this match, the first man to get the pinfall or submission wins but you had to tag in and out! Well, that latter rule didn't last too long as it turned into mayhem with moves even this 25 year plus fan had never seen! Ends when Dutt gets the pinfall for the victory.

Samoa Joe Vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger - This match opens the actual PPV and has Samoa Joe doing a ceremonial dance with his brethren before hitting the ring. Liger gets his share of cheers as well. This was a great opener and my only complaint on it is that it should've gotten more time considering 1. Joe's then-undefeated streak and 2. Liger's legendary reputation. Other than that, it was a great opener!

Diamonds In The Rough (Simon Diamond, Elix Skipper & David Young) Vs. Shark Boy, Sonny Siaki & Apolo - This was a good six man tag team bout. Nothing memorable happened here. Just a solid match to put the DITR group over.

Monty Brown VS. Lance Hoyt - To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this match but they surprised me. Two big men putting on a good match like this as the 6'4"" 250lb. Brown took on the 6'7"", 270lb. Hoyt. Hoyt reminds me of the late Andrew ""Test"" Martin in that he was a tall, muscular guy who could move and take to the air!

Both men put on a good showing but it ends when Brown hit his ""Pounce"" tackle on Hoyt, nearly knocking him out of the ring! Brown wins this one!

The 3Live Kru (Konnan, Ron ""The Truth"" Killings & B.G. James ) Vs. Team Canada (Eric Young, Robert Roode & Johnny Devine) - Another good six man with nothing special other than the appearance of Kip James (formerly ""Bada**"" Billy Gunn of WWE fame). Team Canada takes this one.

Matt Bentley w/Traci Brooks Vs. Petey Williams Vs. Chris Sabin (Ultimate X #1 Contender To The X-Division Championship Match) - Basically, they hang a prize between two ropes that criss-cross each other. The only way to win the match is to climb up to the ropes, shimmy your way to the center and get the prize to win! Petey and Sabin I knew but this was the first time I've seen Matt Bentley (though I am familiar with his valet who is now the wife of TNA star Frankie Kazarian). All three were impressive but allowing Petey to win by the prize (being a figure of an X) falling into his hands was rather cheap! Pretty good match with some nasty spots but I've heard there have been better Ultimate X matches. Still, it is worth watching.

America's Most Wanted (James Storm & Chris Harris) w/Gail Kim Vs. The Naturals (Andy Douglas & Chase Stevens)(NWA World Tag Team Title Match) - This was just a straight up wild brawl as The Naturals lost these titles just 24 hours prior to this match to AMW! They were looking to gain some revenge and take back the titles. They did get some measure of vengeance but in the end, AMW used their heads and seperated the younger team to retain their gold. I would consider this one a MUST VIEW because of the unique moves and the sheer violence!

Abyss Vs. Rhino Vs. Sabu Vs. Jeff Hardy (Monster's Ball Match) - This was a wild affair as well. Worthy of ECW lore! No way I could describe all the action except for two memorably sick spots! Jeff Hardy diving off the Bound For Glory platform onto Abyss through a table! The other was Rhino giving Jeff a piledriver......FROM THE MIDDLE ROPE! Definite match finisher! Rhino takes the victory in this one! A MUST VIEW here!

A.J. Styles Vs. Christopher Daniels (X-Division Championship Ironman Match) - This is actually a rematch from a previous Ironman encounter at one of TNA's other PPV's. I've heard the first match was better than this one....THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING TO ME BECAUSE THIS ONE WAS DAMN GOOD! Just a great wrestling match with fans cheering both wrestlers though Daniels was clearly the heel here! A.J. wins with his ""Styles Clash"" with only 5 seconds left in the match! He gets the first and only pinfall of the contest! Great bout and I would say it is also a MUST VIEW on this DVD!

Abyss Vs. Rhino Vs. Monty Brown Vs. A.J. Styles Vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings Vs. Kip James Vs. Samoa Joe Vs. Lance Hoyt Vs. Sabu Vs. Jeff Hardy (10-Man Gauntlet To Determine The #1 Contender To The NWA World Title) - This match was conducted similiar to WWE's Royal Rumble in that two men start off and every 60 seconds, a new man comes in with the winner getting a shot at Jeff Jarrett and the NWA title right after the match!

It begins with Samoa Joe and Ron ""The Truth"" Killings and it gets interesting from there. In the end, Rhino shocks everyone by winning the match and getting the shot at Jarrett. Which leads to......

Jeff Jarrett Vs. Rhino (NWA World Title Match) - Special referee in this one is Tito Ortiz of MMA fame. The match isn't that long but understandable since Rhino is now wrestling his third time in one night at this point. The interference of Jarrett's allies (AMW and Gail Kim) proves to actually be the downfall of Jarrett as he did have Rhino pinned at one point but they had Ortiz tied up long enough for Rhino to kick out! Ends when Jarrett is ""Gored"" and a new NWA Champion is crowned! After a beatdown by Jarrett, AMW and Team Canada (3Live Kru are also beaten down), Team 3D shows up and evens the odds!

Overall, this was one of TNA's better shows! Worth the money to view!",1304294400,2,5790,4.35899814471243
8098240,4,B000CEV3X2,"Pre-Show: Sonjay Dutt Vs. Alex Shelley Vs. Roderick Strong Vs. Austin Aries - This match was under 4 Way rules where only two guys were allowed in the ring at once but that didn't stop the other two guys getting envolved in the match at times. This match had a lot of highflying, non-stop, fast paced action that included sick spots and all 4 superstars delivering their best. This match was a great mixture of technical wrestling and high flying offense that showcased all 4 superstars executing a 4 man submission hold at one point. This match served it purposed in getting the iMPACT zone anticipated for the show. Great match from the X-Division. 4.5/5

Pay Per View: Samoa Joe Vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger - Man, TNA sure knows how to start off the ""paid"" portion of the Pay Per View! After a huge Samoan heritage entrance from Samoa Joe, Joe and Liger went out there and absolutley tore down the house with the Live TNA fans into every minute of the match. The only downfall I have to point out is the match duration. Being an opening bout of TNA's major show of the year and rightfully being a ""dream match"" in the eyes of many, it's rather a short bout which is disappointing. But you can't deny the fact both guys brought their A game because they did. 4/5

Diamonds In The Rough: Elix Skipper & David Young w/ Simon Diamond Vs. Apollo, Sonny Siaki, & Shark Boy - This was an average six man tag but the big story here was Simon Diamond teaming with the Skipper and Young to help put them back on track from their losing steak. A decent six man tag at best but nothing memorable here. 2.5/5

Lance Hoyt Vs. Monty Brown -  Monty Brown was fired up for this match, even confronting and getting in the face of Jeff Jarrett before this match started. Shockingly, this was a great ""big man"" match that showcased Lance Hoyt flying through the air at times and Monty Brown delivering hard shots to Hoyt and suplexing Hoyt on the outside floor. This was a solid back and forth match that never got slow or boring. 3.5/5

3 Live Kru: Ron ""The Truth"" Killings, Konan, & BG James Vs. Team Canada: Bobby Roode, Eric Young, & A1 w/ Scott D' Amore - Like the earlier six man tag match, this match wasn't much either besides the altercation involving Kip James and Konan before and after the match. Besides that aspect, the match didn't offer anything memorable. 3/5

Petey Williams Vs. Matt Bentley Vs. Chris Sabin (Ultimate X Match) - This match was for the No. 1 Contendersip spot of the X Division Championship. All 3 superstars had great Ultimate X experience going in which made this match more interesting to see. Overall, this match didn't overshadow any of the previous Ultimate X matches in TNA as it was good for what it was. However, the only downside I can point out would be the malfunctioning ""X"" that ruined the ending. But if you can get passed that, this was a fun and solid Ultimate X match. 4/5

NWA Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted w/ Gail Kim Vs. The Naturals - This match was a brawl from the start as Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens rushed the ring before the match and attacking AMW that showcased Stevens taking out James Storm with a powerbomb in the guardrail. From there, Douglas and Stevens aimed for Chris Harris until Storm returned and busted open Douglas and delivering his Eye Of The Storm early in the match. Over time, this match turned into an outstanding and solid tag team encounter with many near falls and back and forth action all the way through. This was my favorite match on the card and for me, it's the best match of the night. Excellent bout. 5/5

Abyss Vs. Jeff Hardy Vs. Rhino Vs. Sabu (Monster's Ball Match) - This second Monster's Ball heavily made up for the slightly disappointed first Monster's Ball match that took place last year at Victory Road. The match was tables galore with various table spots involving Sabu being put through the wood, Rhino hitting Abyss with the Gore, and Jeff Hardy putting himself and Abyss through the table with his Swanton Bomb. This was a hardcore, action packed affair that kept getting better overtime. The destruction finally ends when Hardy is given the Rhino-driver from the middle rope. Awesome match. 5/5

X Division Champion ""Phenomenal"" AJ Styles Vs. ""Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels (30 Minute Iron Man Match) - This was the rematch from their historic Against All Odds Ironman match where AJ defeated Daniels for the title in overtime. Frankly, I didn't see this match reaching that match's potential. This match is basically AJ and Daniels wearing down each other move after move until the final 5 seconds where AJ scores the only pinfall in the match before time expires. Overall this match was good but it isn't better than their bout from Against All Odds. 4.5/5

10 Man Over the Top Rope Gauntlet Match
Samoa Joe Vs, Ron Killings Vs. Sabu Vs. Lance Hoyt Vs. Abyss Vs. Monty Brown Vs. Rhino Vs. Jeff Hardy Vs. Kip James Vs. AJ Styles - This match was Royal Rumble styled to see who was going to face Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Championship. Everybody in this match (except for Kip James) was exhausted from their previous bouts which showed for most during their walk to the ring. This match wasn't anything past the confrontation between Abyss and Samoa Joe along with everybody gunning for each other to gain contendership to face Jarrett for the title with the suprised no show of Raven in the match. 3/5

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett Vs. Rhino - This match was kept short but understandable concerning the circumstances of it. The match was all Jarrett with numerous interferences from AMW/Gail Kim and a few appeareances from his guitar until Rhino was able to pull out the come back win. After the match, Team 3D returns after the hellacious beating they recieved from AMW weeks prior to this event. 3.5/5

In the end, this to me is still one of the best shows TNA has put on. None of the matches on the card are terrible and this is a TNA event I highly recommend.",1304121600,2,5978,4.566231343283582
8098241,5,B000CEV3X2,"This PPV is one of the best in all of 2005. It definitely lived up to it's name,delivering non-stop action from top to bottom with a well mix of storytelling & great wrestling. The best matches on BFG were The Ultimate X match between Petey Williams,Matt Bentley & Chris Sabin which had high-flying excitement and could have done better without the ""X"" falling down from the cables,The Monster's Ball match between Sabu,Rhino,Jeff Hardy & Abyss which was a great reminder of the 1990's ECW and The 30 minute Ironman rematch for the X title between AJ Styles & Chris Daniels which was just as good as thier bout from AAO of the same year. The worst match was the NWA world title match between Jeff Jarrett & Rhino(subbing for Kevin Nash) which short & bitter sweet at best. The rest were ok.

TNA Bound for Glory 2005
Bound for Glory is TNA's flagship PPV, much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WrestleMania/dp/B00124ONF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WrestleMania</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starrcade/dp/B00000ICDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starrcade</a>. This is the first Bound for Glory and one of TNA's best events obtainable. If you are trying to get yourself or someone else into TNA, you need to purchase Bound for Glory 2005. The event had its lacking points, but they were quickly over. The great points of the PPV eclipse the average points. This is TNA's first PPV under Spike TV, and TNA had to deliver.

-Pre-Show-
The Pre-Show was available to every one for free. It was a 30-minute hype for the upcoming PPV. However, this Pre-Show had a couple of good points along with the endless plugging.

Sonjay Dutt VS Austin Aries VS Alex Shelley VS Roderick Strong
This is one of my favorite X-Division matches of all-time. This was not your standard four-way match, only two men were allowed to be in the ring at once. The other participants had to be tagged into the match. All men deliver sick spots and mind blowing highflying action. Get ready for dives, spins, and crashes. This match even features a sick 4-man submission cluster. This match was the perfect way to kick off this Pre-Show.
RATING- 9/10

Raven comes out later in the Pre-Show and demands to replace Kevin Nash, who unexpectedly is in the hospital, in the main event. Zbyszko, the daily manager of TNA, confronts him in the ring. This is a fantastic altercation between these two. Rhino comes out and suggests that maybe a girl has gotten into Raven's head. While that storyline would end up going nowhere, it still that sets up the mystery of the main event for tonight.

-Pay-Per-View Portion-
The Pay-Per-View portion of this event was only for those who paid their hard-earned money for it. All the advertised matches take place in this portion of Bound for Glory.

Samoa Joe VS Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger
If you are a hardcore wrestling fan, you were looking forward to this being the best match on the card. This match is not the dream match every one expected it to be though. This match is a very solid match though. Joe and Liger go back and forth for the entire match. Liger takes a huge dive to the outside onto Joe. The match is short, but served its purpose to open the paid portion of this PPV.
RATING- 8/10

The Diamonds in the Rough VS Apolo/Sonny Siaki/Shark Boy
This match is one of the lacking parts I spoke of earlier. The Diamonds in the Rough have been on a loser streak since...well, since they were formed. This is their chance to get a win and get back on track. There is some solid tag-team action and a few good moments, but this did not deserve to be on Bound for Glory.
RATING- 6/10

Monty Brown VS Lance Hoyt
I never found this feud particularly interesting. You knew who was going to come out on top. This match is a solid encounter though. There is one moment where moment tells all the fans to move. He is suggesting he is going to toss Hoyt into the crowd. He then throws Hoyt back in the ring and calls the fans stupid for moving. The closing moments of this match features several near falls. I thought this deserved its spot on Bound for Glory.
RATING- 7.5/10

3 Live Kru VS Team Canada
Here is our final bad stop of the show. How many times have we seen these two teams face off already? They have faced off too many times in my opinion. The real story behind this match is whether Kip James (Billy Gunn) would help his friend BG James (Road Dogg). The match was an average affair that could have took place on iMPACT. The ending is obvious, despite them trying to make it look the other way.
RATING- 5/10

Ultimate X Match
#1 Contender for X-Division Championship
Matt Bentley VS Chris Sabin VS Petey Williams
These men have been in a combined eight Ultimate X matches. The overflowing experience of the Ultimate X did not create a best Ultimate X match though. There are a few good spots and some fun dives, but nothing you have not seen in other Ultimate X matches. With that said, this make is still a fun highflying assault. The ending to this match, while controversial, is unique and enjoyable.
RATING- 9/10

NWA World Tag Team Championship
America's Most Wanted(c) VS The Naturals
On the previous iMPACT, America's Most Wanted used a beer bottle to recapture the NWA Tag Team Championships for the sixth time. Now America's Most Wanted and Jeff Jarrett have all the power in TNA. The Naturals head into this match at full force and start a huge brawl. Most of this match takes place on the outside of the ring. James Storm takes a sick powerbomb into the guardrail. There are some near falls near the end of the match. This brawl turns into an excellent match.
RATING- 8/10

Monsters Ball 2
Sabu VS Abyss VS Rhino VS Jeff Hardy
Monster's Ball 1 was a slight disappointment. The match was a good hardcore match, but not as brutal as everyone had hoped. Monster's Ball 2 makes up for this in full. The participants have been locked in solitary confinement without food, water, or light the past twenty-four hours. The idea is that when they come out of confinement for this match, they will be irritable and vicious. The idea is a bit silly, but the match is brutal. There are so many spots packed into this match, I do not know how to begin. I will say this; Jeff Hardy takes his biggest lunge to date. The rest of the match is brutal and spot-filled.
RATING- 9.5/10

30 Minute Ironman Match (Match of the DVD)
TNA X-Division Championship
AJ Styles(C) VS Christopher Daniels
Not only is this the longest match on the card, but it is the best match on the card. This is my favorite match ever. After there first Ironman match at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-All-Odds-2005/dp/B000BITVN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against All Odds 2005</a>, TNA decided their biggest show of the year deserved a godly match just like it. Therefore, this is Ironman 2. The psychology used to string together this Ironman Match is perfect. The control switches constantly. The first fifteen minutes are mostly wear-down moves with a few big moves. The rest of the match features power move after power move. The closing minutes are epic and will have you marking out like a little schoolgirl. If you do not love this Ironman masterpiece, you and me are going to have a talk.
RATING- 10/10

10 Man Gauntlet
# Contender for NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Considering this match was created on the spot, this turned into a great Gauntlet. The first two men starting were Samoa Joe and Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. They wrestled for two minutes before another competitor entered the match. After the third participant entered the ring, there would be one-minute intervals between the other entrants. The object was to throw the other wrestlers out of the ring. If you are the last man in the ring, you win. Joe has a couple good stand-offs during this Gauntlet. The winner, who faced Jarrett next, is a good choice.
RATING- 8/10

Special Referee- Tito Ortiz
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Jeff Jarrett(c) VS Rhino
This main event reminds me a lot of Raven VS Funk from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ECW-Barely-Legal/dp/B00005A094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ECW Barely Legal</a>. It is not a good match, but it is a great ending to the show. Rhino is dominated for a couple of minutes before getting the gore and winning it. I do not mind telling you that spoiler, because Jarrett would win the belt back two weeks later. Tito Ortiz has a very little purpose for being a part of this match. At the end of the day, this is still better than what Jarrett/Nash would have pulled off. The aftermath is fun, but expected.
RATING- 6/10

-Bonus-
The bonus section in TNA DVDs is usually a let down. Often times you will get replays of a few moves and maybe a small backstage segment. Bound for Glory 2005 is special though, and needed some fantastic extras though. They give you an Ultimate X match and a looking inside Fanfest.

Inside TNA InterAction Fanfest
Take a look inside TNA's fan show before Bound for Glory 2005. You get to hear comments from fans on how much they love TNA. You also hear a few comments from wrestlers like AJ Styles and BG James. I love the kid getting his steel chair signed by all the wrestlers.

Ultimate X Match (iMPACT, 10/05)
#1 Contender for X-Division Championship
Matt Bentley VS Chris Sabin VS Petey Williams
After the controversial ending of the Bound for Glory match, they put in place a rematch on iMPACT. This match is shorter, but still a great Ultimate X match. There are plenty of juicy spots in this one as well. This time, despite a close call, the ending is normal. There is a commercial break in the middle of the match, but it will not hurt your viewing too much.
