8193148,1,B000PSJDPA,"The previous review by Mr Hayes, is on the mark. The film quality is worse than awful; I strongly suspect that an ancient black-and-white film has been colorized. Whether that's the case or not, the current color is garish and grainy. Even my love of Prokofiev's music will not prevent me from discarding this DVD, since offering it for resale would violate my principles.",1188172800,5,372,4.828125
8193149,1,B000PSJDPA,"This DVD is dated 2007 but is as old as the hills. Not only that, it is performed in a studio without an audience and has a ""dead"", lacklustre feel. Described as a ""gorgeous production"" one can think only that the writer of the blurb doesn't know the difference between ""gorgeous"" and ""garish"". Keep your money in your pocket.",1185062400,6,326,4.5423728813559325
