3566222,3,B001F7XHWK,"I found this video to be slightly on the sloppy side... Sloppy playing, sloppy sound, sloppy camera work... Maybe that fits a band like Molly Hatchet but I don't like watching videos like that. If you're a fan of MH, I'm sure you'll enjoy this.",1294963200,,244,4.444444444444445
3566223,1,B001F7XHWK,"Flirtin' with Disatser is exactly what Molly hatchet did on this video.
The guys were really looking rough and the camera was all over the place. I saw Molly Hatchet several times in the seventies and they were a great band. With only one original member (Dave lookin'good man)left the current version is nothing more than an good cover band. The worst part for me was while the audio was decent the video was about 5 seconds behind the sound. Maybe I just got a bad copy.>",1263168000,,473,4.448275862068965
3566224,3,B001F7XHWK,"First of all I want to let everyone know that I am a true Molly Hatchet fan. I remember seeing them live in Spokane on their Beatin' The Odds tour way back when.

The reason I give this video three stars is the crowd.  See below for my reasons.

I feel so sorry for anyone who watches this show and sees the crowd in this video.  Kentucky, you should be ashamed or yourselves. I want to ask all Kentuckian's a question - Is it so hard to scream and yell and have a great time at a fantastic concert when y'all leave the trailer park/family reunion?  I guess it is.

It seems as if the crowd gets smaller and smaller as the show goes on. Also, as you watch the concert you hear a crowed cheering and yelling and you know it's been dubbed in cuz the crowd in this video is SILENT. The crowd sits on their hands pretty much the whole show. Some people are really into it but not many. Watch and you will be disgusted by camera shots that show the crowd just sitting there doing nothing. The crowd on this video is horrible. It's very very hard to watch.

If any of you decide to buy this video just put it in your dvd player and turn your tv off and crank the stereo.  The crowd will get you down if you watch and listen.

Also, if you buy ""Blackfoot - Live in Kentucky"", it's the same exact venue. Same sad crowd maybe? The crowd on Blackfoot's video is just as bad.

When I watched the video I was embarassed by the crowd. Great band jammin' and rockin' the whole show and the Kentucky crowd not appreciating what they are watching. What a disgrace to awesome Southern Rock/Rock Music in general.  Go home and never show up to a concert again people.

Guess I have to lay some of the blame on the bands for recording anything in front of this mullet wearing trailer trash audience. You all will see I am telling the truth if/when you watch the vid.

I give the band ten stars. Not enough stars actually for the way they play. Molly Hatchet does an incredible job as usual. Bobby, Phil, Dave, John, Tim and Shawn absolutely rock.  They prove they are the ""heaviest"" of all Southern Rock bands.

The only drawback I have is the choreographed stuff they do during the show. Not needed. Just my opinion.

Otherwise:

Great Southern Rock will never die! Buy this video and enjoy some truly classic music.

Long Live Molly Hatchet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1253059200,4,2338,4.311212814645309
3566225,4,B001F7XHWK,I would recommend this video to any true Molly Hatchet fan.  It is a great quality video.  It has most of their hits on it.  I was very pleased and enjoyed it so much that we have watched it several times.  Our friends enjoyed it as well!,1252368000,,238,4.0
3566226,5,B001F7XHWK,"Although this is not the original line-up, vocalist Phil McCormack's voice is similar to that of Danny Joe Brown. Dave Hlubek (lead and rhythm guitars) who is the founding member of this band is also here along with John Galvin (piano). Long time member Bobby Ingram (lead, slide and acoustic guitars) who had joined the band from the ""Lightning Strikes Twice"" album is now the leader of the band and the owner the trade mark ""Molly Hatchet"". Tim Lindsey (bass guitar) and Shawn Beamer (Drums).

They are as tight as the line-up for ""Double Trouble Live"".

All songs that were performed are great;

1. Whiskey Man 2. Bounty Hunter 3. Gator Country 4. Son of the South 5. Fall of the Peacemaker 6. Devi's Canyon 7. Get in the game 8. Drum Solo 9. Beatin The Odds 10. Moonlight dancing on the bayou 11. Rainbow Bridge 12. Layla/guitar sol 13. Dreams I'll never see 14. Flirting with disaster.

The dvd contains interview, biography, discography and photo album.

I wish bands these days can still make music like this! Now do yourself a favor, buy this dvd and once you have it turn off the lights and play it loud or play it louder!",1246060800,7,1131,4.551724137931035
3566227,4,B001F7XHWK,A good DVD but I do miss Bobby Jo Brown on lead vocals.  The band is tight but they try to copy the stage presence of Lynyrd Skynyrd too much. Not a bad purchase for the money.,1238889600,,176,3.7567567567567566
3566228,4,B001F7XHWK,"I don't know how much money went into producing this DVD but the picture and sound is really decent and ""Molly Hatchet"" fans of all ages should come away pleased with the overall effort put out by the band and everyone involved with this release. The disc packaging and disc artwork are well done and Dead Line Music should be commended for their efforts. Personally I think this DVD is a low budget effort from Dead Line Music with the feel of a big studio production.

I'll admit that while I've never heard of Cleopatra Records or Dead Line Music I'm really happy that I discovered this ""Molly Hatchet"" live concert DVD and added it to my collection. The ""Molly Hatchet"" live concert DVD showcases the band in front of an enthusiastic crowd and make no mistake; the Boys of Southern Rock are definitely there to entertain their fans. This live concert DVD from ""Molly Hatchet"" was filmed in Prestonsburg Kentucky at the Mountain Arts Center in October 2006.

In my opinion I would rate the quality of the picture and sound about a 6.5 - 7/10. This concert DVD was definitely viewable on my 40"" LCD television despite some small imperfections. The video image is really decent even if it does go out of focus at times throughout the show. The most disappointing aspect of this live concert for me was the poor camera angles and sub par editing from the camera crew. When I buy a concert DVD I want to see the band perform and not the crowd all the time.

Some of the bands most successful songs are featured in the fourteen song set list as well as a drum solo from Shawn Beamer. Hearing the band play ""Flirtin' with Disaster,"" ""Bounty Hunter,"" ""Beatin the Odds,"" and ""Son of the South"" was definitely worth the price of this DVD for me. The Hatchet is definitely back!

3566236,3,B001F7XHWK,I am the same age as these guys. I have a large DVD concert collection and this one is not as good as I hoped. A bit boring after a while. Most of the band is about 80lbs. overweight each. Not a great stage presentation. This concert is about 10 years old. I saw them 20yrs. ago and it was  a good show.

3566246,5,B001F7XHWK,"I was completely blown away by this performance from Molly Hatchet in every way ! The new songs are on par with the older ones which is saying alot and the musical talent on display is second to none ! Sean Beamer`s drum solo was nothing short of phenomanal as well , i can`t remember but one or two  i`ve seen in a lifetime that could even compare to the assault he laid down on those skins ! Bobby Ingram`s guitar virtuoso get`s the limelight as well as he gave full display of his talent along with Dave Hlubek . McCormacks vocals are spot on too as well as the rest of the band. I`m very impressed with the song wri! ting as well on the newer songs. I have the 1996 Rockplast dvd too but this one..this one is proof of Molly Hatchet`s rise to the top of the mountain as far as Southern Rock Royalty stands. They`re right there with Skynyrd and anyone else you could name at this time and as far as folks saying this isn`t the real Molly Hatchet that is utter nonsense. As Bobby Ingram says in the interview this is the natural evolution of where Molly Hatchet should be and it`s a very fine place to be indeed. Buy this DVD  now !!! Don`t wait !",1363996800,,1149,4.147982062780269
3566247,4,B001F7XHWK,"This concert is really good, the band is in the zone. Bobby Ingram is a very elite guitar player. I have the Blackfoot dvd filmed in this same venue, there are actually some of the same crowd at both concert which is cool, but it actually sounds like on both shows that the crowd sounds were dubbed in. The crowd does get smaller as the concert goes on, but other than that the band is rocking. Just buy it and don't pay attention to the crowd.",1308528000,,444,4.174418604651163

8301270,5,B001F7XHWK,"What a great concert. Very professional video and audio. Great photography without constant change of camera angles which I hate in a concert video. Molly Hatchet is the least well known of what I consider the three best Southern rock groups of the '70s, the others being the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. But you have to appreciate how good this band is by watching this concert. If you are a MH fan, this is an indispensible addition to your collection. Or if you just like to watch and hear vintage rock played by the original members of this fantastic group, you won't be disappointed. The audience apparently agreed too, except for the stern frowning dude with arms crossed in the first row which the cameraman pans to a few times. What a hoot!",1470441600,3,760,4.637037037037037
