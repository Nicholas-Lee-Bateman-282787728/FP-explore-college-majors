They have helped me a lot with pain from a painful Bakers  Bursa in my leg.  The gentle movements helped me regain strength and prevent pain.",1492905600,,299,4.60377358490566
8743459,5,B0190TC0EA,"Joe Pinella is a great teacher. He understands how to build confidence in his students. His thorough and patient demonstrations of the moves, presented before the actual routine is tackled, is excellent, giving any student of his a chance to excel easily. The exercises flow, imparting a return of trust in the body, through calm control of the body. After only a couple of sessions,  I felt much improvement in my balance, as well as a strengthened feeling of confidence in my body. My knees feel much better, too. Joe Pinella's exercises and technique work! And they are gentle exercises that can work for any age, even if your knees are achy like mine. I wish I had had this video to use with my elderly mother to ease her fear of falling.",1464998400,,742,4.578947368421052
